"His announcement as a contestant on reality show The Jump seemed to be a surprising move for the husband of a royal. But Mike Tindall has revealed he and his wife Zara Phillips, 33, the Queen’s granddaughter, are not controlled by Palace protocol. And when the Channel 4 ski contest begins on Sunday, the former England rugby star, 36, will join celebrities including Heather Mills, 47, Lady Victoria Hervey, 38, and Chloe Madeley, 27, on the slopes. Former England rugby star Mike Tindall is appearing in the latest series of Channel Four's Jump . Tindall gives a tremendously candid interview to this week's edition of the Radio Times, pictured . Giving a candid interview Tindall said it is a ‘lie’ that he and his wife are told what to do by the Royal Family. He also opened up about the unedifying 2011 Rugby World Cup incident, shortly after his marriage, when he was pictured kissing another woman. A previous venture into the world of entertainment by the Royal Family led to widespread ridicule - Prince Edward was criticised after broadcasting a royal version of the boisterous 1980s television game show It’s a Knockout - but Tindall said he would not allow this to restrict him. He said: ‘They’re separate from us; we run our own life.’ He added: ‘That [how his involvement will reflect on the royals] would always come up, yes, of course, but ultimately it’s what we want to do first.’ Tindall, pictured, was prevented from skiing during his professional rugby career in case of injury . It means Tindall, who was banned from skiing throughout his professional rugby career, in case of injury, has been free to accept a place on The Jump – marking his first move into the world of showbusiness. And he has taken the opportunity to speak about the 2011 incident when he was drinking in a New Zealand bar with his England Rugby teammates. CCTV footage caught Tindall kissing a blonde woman, who was later revealed as his ex-girlfriend Jessica Palmer. Asked whether he had any regrets over his behaviour, Tindall told Radio Times: ‘No, not really. It’s easy to look back and say you wish it hadn’t happened. If you’d asked me do I regret going out and having a good time with the fans and all the boys – no. But obviously if I had known the spin-off from it all, I wouldn’t want that.’ Miss Phillips, 33, who is the mother of Tindall’s one-year-old daughter Mia, was visibly upset during appearances following the scandal, but Tindall said: ‘Quite a big mountain was made out of a fairly small molehill.’ Taking part in The Jump will see Tindall and the 15 other contestants take part in a series of challenges on the slopes, including speed skiing, ski jumping and skeleton races. Many of the disciplines can be dangerous. And two contestants have already pulled out with injuries - Sally Bercow, wife of the Speaker of the House of Commons, and Strictly Come Dancing professional Ola Jordan. But Tindall said he sought advice from Sir Steve Redgrave, who suffered an injury during series one of the ski contest last year. And the rowing champion’s enthusiasm for the contest made Tindall confident he has made the right choice. Tindall said: ‘I asked him whether it was a good thing to do. Did he enjoy it? And he said “Yeah, I really enjoyed it. Do it. I’ve got nothing bad to say about it.” If a five-time Olympic gold-medallist tells you that, you’re in a pretty safe place.’ Tindall, right, who is married to the Queen's grand daughter Zara Philips, right, used the interview to address an embarrassing incident in 2011 where he was photographed kissing a woman while on tour with England . Speaking of his motivation, to take part, Tindall said: ‘I watched it last year and loved it, and pretty much said then that it would be one of the only TV shows I’d do. And the other reason is, I love skiing. I haven’t been able to ski for so long, with rugby getting in the way. ‘Since I stopped playing internationally, I’ve been three times in the last two years and loved it. So I loved the idea of being able to go out and get better at skiing. Getting that sort of high-end tutorage while we’re out there will be amazing. Plus there’s an element of competition, which I don’t get that often anymore.’ The Jump begins on Sunday January 1 at 7pm and is presented by Davina McCall. The other celebrities taking part include Gogglebox star Dom Parker, former England cricketer Phil Tufnell, Heptathlete Louise Hazel, and dancer Louie Spence. The Only Way Is Essex star Joey Essex, ex-Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts and singer Stacey Solomon have also signed up, as well as Jack Ass star Steve-O, JLS singer JB Gill, Paralympian Jon-Allan Butterworth, model and TV presenter Jodie Kidd and Made In Chelsea star Louise Thompson.","Mike Tindall is taking part in the second series of Jump on Channel Four .

"Ed Miliband only discovered his grandfather died in a Nazi concentration camp six months ago, he revealed this morning. The Labour leader said today's Holocaust Memorial Day commemorations were 'really emotional' for him and other Jewish families affected by the genocide. He said his family had not talked much about the Holocaust growing up and had only discovered the truth about his grandfather after visiting Israel last year. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband revealed the recent discovery of his grandfather's murder in an interview with BBC Five Live at their studios in Salford this morning . Mr Miliband, whose mother and father fled to Britain to escape the Nazis, said: 'It's 70 years since my grandfather died in one of the camps and I marked that about ten days ago. 'And you know, it's really hard this, because I talked to my mum about this: it's not the kind of thing you talked about very much when you're growing up in a household affected by these things, but it sort of marks you and it's so important that we remember. 'I think the theme of Holocaust Memorial Day this year is keep the memory alive. And as you say, Nicky, when there's prejudice around the world, when we see the rise of anti-Semitism, it's incredibly important that we keep that memory alive.' He explained how he had only just found out about the circumstances surrounding his grandfather's death. 'I know this sounds almost unbelievable, but it's only about six months ago that we discovered the full circumstances of what happened to my grandfather. 'He ended up in Germany in a labour camp, which is where he eventually died according to the records. I went to Yad Vashem, the place in Israel where they have records on the Holocaust, and that's where we discovered more information about what had happened to him.' Survivors walk out the gate with the sign saying 'Work makes you free' after paying tribute to fallen comrades at the 'death wall' execution spot in the former Auschwitz concentration today . The former Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz-Birkenau in in the town of Oswiecim, Poland . Ed Miliband spoke emotionally about explaining to his children what had happened in the war. He revealed how he had to explain to his son Daniel why he was lighting a candle for his grandfather who had been murdered in a Nazi extermination camp. He said: 'I lit the candle and my kids, my eldest son Daniel said to me ""what's that for?"" and he's five so it's hard to explain. 'I explained it was my grandfather who I didn't meet and who died at a very young age.' Mr Miliband said the experience of his family had made him realise both the horror and hope in people's treatment of Jews. 'It's awful and it makes me feel incredibly lucky. There's horror and there's hope, because it's also the case that many members of my family were saved because they were Jews who were hidden by decent people. [There's another story, which is that there were 17 members of my family who were sheltered in a Belgian village – that's on my father's side – and it was only because of the decent people in that village who helped them. 'So I think this year and at all times, it's right to remember the horror, but it's also right to remember the hope and sense of optimism of what decent people did to save Jews.' Mr Miliband's remarks come as about 300 Auschwitz survivors gathered at the site of the former Nazi death camp to mark the 70th anniversary of its liberation. The commemoration will be held at the site in southern Poland where 1.1 million people, the vast majority Jews, were killed between 1940 and 1945. It is expected to be the last major anniversary event that survivors are able to attend in considerable numbers. Heads of state and representatives from wartime Allies will also be present. Events include the laying of a wreath, a church service, and the lighting of candles at a memorial in the former death camp of Birkenau, which was part of the Auschwitz complex. Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated by the Red Army of the Soviet Union on 27 January 1945. It opened as a museum in 1947. Nick Clegg today backed a call for gay victims of the Holocaust to be remembered on a national memorial. The Deputy Prime Minister told the gay magazine PinkNews he felt Holocaust memorials should include non-Jewish victims of the persecution, which included up to 15,000 homosexuals forced to wear a 'pink triangle' and live in concentration camps. Sixty members of Mr Miliband's family were killed during the Holocaust and he yesterday visited the Yad Vashem Museum, which remembers those who lost their lives in the atrocity . Several monuments across the world already commemorate the gay and lesbian victims, including in Tel Aviv, Amsterdam, Berlin and San Francisco. The Liberal Democrat leader said: 'Today we remember the millions of innocent people who lost their lives in the Holocaust, one of the worst genocides known to man. Their crimes - nothing more than the way they were born. 'As we pay tribute to them, we must never forget the tens of thousands of gay people who were so brutally persecuted and executed at the hands of the Nazis, simply because of their sexuality. 'The symbol of the pink triangle, once intended as a badge of shame, today stands as an international symbol of freedom and pride. From the dark shadow of history rises a neon emblem of diversity and hope. 'Any memorial remembering the Holocaust should recognise the persecution of non-Jewish victims whilst maintaining the centrality of the six million murdered Jews.' Benjamin Cohen, chief executive of PinkNews will say in an article to be published alongside Mr Clegg's: 'Last year, the Government announced the formation of the Holocaust Commission with a mission to create a permanent memorial to the Holocaust in Britain and increase the level of awareness of this important part of modern history. 'It's incumbent for the commission to ensure that the persecution of gay people is included in the memorial, perhaps with the inclusion of the pink triangle.' Read more: .

"Whistleblowing site WikiLeaks on Monday accused Google of handing over the emails and electronic data of its senior staff to the US authorities without providing notification until almost three years later. Google was apparently acting in response to warrants issued by the US Department of Justice, which is investigating WikiLeaks for publishing hundreds of thousands of classified military and diplomatic files. WikiLeaks said the allegations against it point to a far broader investigation into its activities than the US authorities have previously indicated. WikiLeaks has accused Google of handing over the emails and electronic data of its senior staff, including investigations editor Sarah Harrison (pictured), to US authorities without notification for three years . Alleged offences range from espionage to theft of US government property and computer fraud and abuse, it said. 'Today, WikiLeaks' lawyers have written to Google and the US Department of Justice concerning a serious violation of the privacy and journalistic rights of WikiLeaks' staff,' the site said in a statement. WikiLeaks said that Google could and should have resisted complying with the warrants, as well as immediately informing those whose data it handed over. The warrants demanded emails, contacts and IP addresses relating to the Google accounts of investigations editor Sarah Harrison, section editor Joseph Farrell and spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson. At a press conference in Geneva, Ms Harrison (pictured with Edward Snowden in 2013)  said 'we want to know why the three journalists were not notified of being spied (upon)' 'We want to know why the three journalists were not notified of being spied (upon),' Harrison said at a press conference in Geneva. Baltasar Garzon, a former Spanish judge who is Assange's lawyer, told reporters at the event: 'We believe the way the documents were taken is illegal'. He said that 'a law restricted for national security was used against their privacy' and he threatened legal action against Google and US authorities. The information was handed over to the US authorities on April 5, 2012, but Google did not inform the WikiLeaks staff until December 23, 2014, according to documents obtained by AFP. 'While WikiLeaks journalists, perhaps uniquely, do not use Google services for internal communications or for communicating with sources, the search warrants nonetheless represent a substantial invasion of their personal privacy and freedom,' the organisation added. WikiLeaks has been targeted by the US authorities since its release in 2010 of 500,000 secret military files on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and 250,000 diplomatic cables. A former army intelligence analyst, Chelsea Manning, is currently serving a 35-year prison term for leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange also believes he is a target for prosecution and has been holed up at the Ecuadoran embassy in London since 2012. He sought asylum there to avoid being sent to Sweden, where he faces allegations of rape and sexual molestation which he denies. He says his extradition to Sweden could see him transferred on to the United States. 'His conditions are worse than all other detainees since he can not go outside, have a little walk in the garden for instance, without being arrested,' his lawyer Garzon said on Monday. In a statement to AFP, Google said it did not comment on individual cases, but said: 'Obviously, we follow the law like any other company. Chelsea Manning (right) is serving a 35-year prison term for leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks and founder Julian Assange (left) has been holed up in the Ecuadoran embassy in London since 2012 . 'When we receive a subpoena or court order, we check to see if it meets both the letter and the spirit of the law before complying. 'And if it doesn't we can object or ask that the request is narrowed. We have a track record of advocating on behalf of our users.' It is not the first time WikiLeaks has clashed with the online giant. In September 2014, Assange published a book, 'When Google Met WikiLeaks', questioning the Internet firm's close ties with the US administration.","Staff of site weren't notified of Google's actions until three years later .

"A woman desperate to have a baby is appealing for donations from strangers so she can afford IVF treatment after being refused by the NHS. Eva McConville, 28, from Liverpool, is using crowdfunding website gofundme.com in order to raise £6,000 so she can have a child with her fiancé, Matty. The couple have been turned down for fertility treatment on the NHS because Matty already has a child from a previous relationship. Last resort: Eva has set up a crowdfunding page to raise money so she can have IVF after being refused assistance on the NHS . Eva told the Sun On Sunday that the fundraising appeal - set up by her mother, Patricia, is their last resort. Eva said: 'I hate having to ask for money but it's our only chance. I'm willing to do anything to get our baby. 'Not having as baby absolutely kills us.' The couple have so far received £1,455 after Patricia, 55, set up the appeal for her daughter last June. Patricia said: 'To see Eva destroyed by this was awful. If I had the money they'd have it in a second. But this was something I could do.' On the crowdfunding page, Patricia reveals how Eva and Matty had been unsuccessfully trying for a baby for four years after being together since 2001. Matty, 33, discovered a lump on one of his testicles and, concerned that this was the reason they were failing to conceive, he went to his doctor to be examined. The 28-year-old can't get IVF on the NHS because her fiance already has a child from a previous relationship . The couple were horrified to discover that it was in fact lymphoma. Matty had his testicle removed and underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy from 2011 onwards. He was told before his treatment commenced that there was still hope he and Eva could have a child in the future if he deposited his sperm in a sperm bank. Patricia said: 'Throughout the period of Matty’s treatment, I believe what got them through was the hope that they would fulfil their dream of having a child.' However, the couple received a letter from The Hewitt Fertility Centre, part of Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust, saying they would not be able to have IVF. Eva said: 'Because  Matty has had cancer, IVF is our only hope. But the NHS won't pay because he has a child from a past relationship.' Patricia said she's devastated her daughter may never be a mother. She writes on their gofundme page: 'What about Eva's right to be a mother or for them to raise their own child and be a family?' Builder Matty has recovered from cancer thanks to his treatment and Patricia said while they are all grateful for this, the couple face an unhappy future if they cannot have a baby. So far, Eva is £1,455 towards her £6,000 target after her mother set up the page on her behalf . Patricia, a social worker, said it has taken a huge toll on her daughter's well-being. She said: 'I could go on and on about my research into the psychological issues and effects related to infertility but I wish to focus on what my family and I have observed first-hand with Eva and Matty. 'Eva is a shadow of her former self.' She added: 'As Eva's parent I have watched how the desire for a child has affected every part of who she is. 'Eva has lost her confidence and self-esteem... she is depressed, angry, and always emotionally fragile.' Patricia explains that the couple accept IVF has no guarantee of success but they would love the opportunity to try - if they can raise the money to pay for it.","Eva McConville, 28, from Liverpool, was refused IVF on the NHS .

"A 23-stone mother-of-one has lost more than half her body-weight after taking up bodybuilding – and is now training for a modelling competition. Amy Champion, 25, from Pontypridd, south Wales, once struggled to fit into size 20 clothes, and could not walk up stairs without getting out of breath. She piled on the pounds after falling pregnant with her daughter Annwyn, now two, using it as 'an excuse' to eat for two, scoffing on chocolate, biscuits and fizzy drinks. Scroll down for video . Transformation: Amy, left before her weight loss, and, right, training for a fitness competition . Amy said she piled on the pounds by 'eating for two' while pregnant with Annwyn (pictured) After joining a gym, Amy, who is a salon management student and is married to Sam, 26, discovered she had a knack for lifting weights and has now lost an incredible 12 stone, dropping to a size 8. Now the 5ft 10in weight-lifter, who was bullied and called a 'whale' because of her size, says she has never felt more confident about her body. Amy said: 'I'd always been big, and when I found out I was pregnant with my daughter, I started eating for two. The 25-year-old, who was a size 20, starting weight training and shed more than half her bodyweight . Amy is now a svelte size 8, pictured left and right after her weight loss, and has ditched unhealthy eating . 'I'd have a bacon sandwich for breakfast, followed by a sausage roll for lunch and then a massive pizza for tea. And throughout the day, I'd munch on chocolate, crisps and biscuits. 'Looking back, I can't believe how much I actually ate.' As Amy's weight soared to 23st, strangers began to stare and whisper and she also heard through friends that people referred to her as a 'whale'. She became self-conscious about her appearance and began to shun social events in favour of nights in front of the TV with her police officer husband.

BREAKFAST: Bacon sandwich . LUNCH: Sausage roll, can of Coke . TEA: Large takeaway pizza . SNACKS: Chocolate, biscuits, crisps . BREAKFAST: Porridge, fruit . LUNCH: Chicken salad . TEA: Chicken stir fry . SNACKS: Fruit . Amy said: 'I used my pregnancy as an excuse to avoid going out with my friends. The truth was that I was ashamed of myself. 'Even simple things like family barbeques were a nightmare, as I couldn't fit into the plastic chairs. 'Sam was always telling me how beautiful he thought I was, but it didn't make any difference. 'It was a vicious cycle. I hated the way I looked, but I just couldn't stop eating.' The turning point for Amy came in June 2012, when she gave birth to her daughter. Amy, pictured at 23 stone and a size 20 after giving birth to Annwyn, ditched biscuits for biceps . Amy, left, on holiday weighing 18 stone, and right, taking a selfie after dropping to a size 8 . Amy said: 'I'd been told by doctors that I'd never have children because of cysts on my ovaries. So when Annwyn was born, it was our own little miracle. 'She was absolutely perfect. As I held her in my arms, I promised myself that I would never let her grow up to be as ashamed of her body as I was of mine. 'I knew that after years of denying I had a problem, it was finally time to face my demons and build a happy, healthy future for me and my family.' Determined to set a good example, Amy joined a gym and threw out all of the junk food from her cupboards. Instead of scoffing on chocolate and takeaways, she began a healthy diet that included plenty of fruit and vegetables, and worked out with a personal trainer up to five times per week. Amy said she swapped her unhealthy diet for one that included more fruit and veg and started weightlifting . Amy, with Annwyn, left, at 20st and a size 18, and right, in training after losing half her bodyweight . She said: 'My first trip to the gym was absolutely mortifying. I had to walk slowly on the treadmill in case my flab jiggled, and by the end of the hour I was dripping in sweat. 'But I was proud that I had stuck to it, so I kept on going back. In time, I realised that I actually really enjoyed working out - especially lifting weights. 'I liked the challenge of pushing myself more each time, and every time I improved, I felt a sense of achievement. 'This really spurred me on to continue losing the weight.' Amy's dedication to the gym paid off, and over the next 18 months, she lost an incredible 12st - taking her down to a svelte 11st. Now a size 8, Amy is even training for a fitness modelling competition, where she will parade her bikini body in front of hundreds of people. Amy said: 'Two years ago, I could never have believed that I would be doing anything like this. I hated my body, and didn't want anyone to see it. 'I've worked really hard to get where I am and I'm the happiest I've ever been. Best of all, I know I'm setting a good example for Annwyn. 'I'll never go back to being the size I was. Now that I've swapped biscuits for biceps, I'm in the best shape of my life.'","Amy Champion would eat for two 'as an excuse' while carrying Annwyn, 2 .

"A jewellery maker has been become Britain's Queen of Bling after she rose from obscurity to design the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite earrings. Catherine Zoraida, 32, set up her small, self-titled firm just four years ago and was virtually unknown until the 33-year-old royal asked to see some pieces. Kate, 33, went on to wear a pair of the designer's stunning 'double leaf' earrings and an intricate 'Spread Your Wings' bracelet, £420, while meeting the King of Malaysia during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee tour in 2012.

Catherine, who trained at Edinburgh College of Art, said that the Duchess had come across her work and requested some pieces to look at. She bought seven pieces including the earrings and the bracelet. The 18 carat gold plated bracelet is made of an intricately linked leaf design and measures 17cm in length and the designer notes it will add drama to any outfit. She said: 'It was just before the Queen's Diamond Jubilee tour and amazingly she ended up wearing some of these pieces. 'She wore the earrings and a bracelet to dinner with the King of Malaysia.

"Monday morning commuters had to deal with ‘utter chaos’ on the railways yesterday after a computer fault wiped station information screens. Passengers all around the country complained of missing trains or getting on the wrong ones as live train information went out of sync with arrivals or disappeared from platform screens altogether. The glitch also caused smartphone apps which track live train arrivals to show incorrect times – with many falsely saying trains were significantly delayed. Monday morning commuters had to deal with ‘utter chaos’ on the railways yesterday after a computer fault wiped station information screens (file picture) Network Rail said a ‘server crash’ was responsible for the problem, which started in the middle of the morning rush hour and took at least two hours to resolve. Some passengers were still complaining of problems at 1.20pm. Several train companies asked commuters to tweet them for live travel details as complaints about a lack of announcements or information from station staff flooded social media. Commuter Steve Grant, who was trying to get a train from East Croydon, said the station was in ‘utter chaos’ with information boards saying ‘nothing’. ‘Marc’ wrote on Twitter: ‘Should be a fun commute. The station info boards and audio announcements are broken so no one has any idea what train is arriving or when.’ Domenic Donatantonio tweeted: ‘Back to 1995 today. Neither Southern Rail app, station display or station worker can tell when train will arrive.’ A Twitter user in Scotland wrote: ‘@ScotRail you’ll be pleased to know I missed my train due to bad information and having to check’, while a passenger in Sheffield complained no one knew which platform they were supposed to get as the information boards were blank and there were no announcements. Others complained the lack of information meant they were not told about changes to services. Joseph Thompson wrote: ‘7:53 Denmark Hill to Dartford platform changed, passengers only told 5 mins after it left, everyone missed train.’ Passengers all around the country complained of missing trains or getting on the wrong ones as live train information went out of sync with arrivals or disappeared from platform screens altogether (file picture) Another Twitter user said: ‘The 8:39 came before the 8:30 but they said it was the 8:30 not the 8:39 so now I’ve missed my train and all the others are delayed.’ Sam Hind tweeted Northern Rail saying: ‘You might want to sort your app out @northernrailorg, giving incorrect info meaning I missed the train. Six mins late but quoted 20. Great job.’ A message from the South West Trains official Twitter account said station staff were ‘also affected by the same problem’ so could not provide any more information to passengers. Network Rail said servers which provide information to display screens crashed and had to be restarted, meaning it took some time for them to catch up. A spokesman said: ‘We experienced some problems with our servers which a caused a loss of data to train operators’ information systems. ‘The server was restarted and all data feeds are now processing as they should. There was some delay whilst the systems processed the backlog of data. ‘We apologise to any passengers whose journey was disrupted by this malfunction.’","Chaotic scenes at train stations after a glitch wiped information screens .

"Andy Murray is confident of bursting Australia's bubble for the second time when he plays teenage sensation Nick Kyrgios in their hotly anticipated Australian Open quarter-final on Tuesday night. Murray has shown ruthless form en route to the last eight in a run that also ended the tournament of Australia's Marinko Matosevic in the second round. Kyrgios and Murray have met once before, in Toronto last year, with the Scot inflicting the 19-year-old's worst professional loss in a 6-2 6-2 victory. While Kyrgios' game has come along since then, the world No.6 believes he has the Canberran's measure. 'There were some things that I did in that match which I believe will work,' Murray said. But one thing Murray will no doubt struggle to contend with is Kyrgios's booming serve - which the cheeky youngster offered to help Belarusian star Victoria Azarenka with in 'private lessons' during a very flirty Twitter exchange. Scroll down for video . Andy Murray is confident he can beat Australia's young gun Nick Kyrgios (pictured) in their upcoming match . Murray said he's learnt some things playing against him and feels there are parts of his game he can exploit . 'Private lessons of course': Nick Kyrgios's public flirting with Victoria Azarenka has been one of the talking points of the Australian Open . The pair enjoyed some cheeky back and forth on Twitter before Kyrgios played Andreas Seppi . 'I've learnt stuff from playing against him there and at the (International Tennis Premier League) and watching him a bit,' Murray added. 'Stuff that I feel I can use and exploit in his game.' Kyrgios is the odd man out in the quarter-finals. Each of the eight top-ranked men found a way through the draw to the quarters, with the exception of world No.2 Roger Federer in Kyrgios' section. The Australian hopeful now confronts the world's best despite an extraordinary gap in experience to his title rivals. Aged at least five years younger than the seven other contenders, Kyrgios is 3003 match wins and 174 titles behind the field.

Kyrgios and Murray have met once before, in Toronto last year, with the Scot inflicting the 19-year-old's worst professional loss in a 6-2 6-2 victory . But Murray said Kyrgios would have some advantages compared to their match last August. 'It was a fairly empty stadium when we played in Toronto, I think Nick enjoys playing in front of a crowd,' he said. 'We played during the day... the night match, that changes the conditions again.' Kyrgios' bid to make the last four is by no means the only blockbuster of the day.

The other men's quarter-final is 2009 Open champions Rafael Nadal against world No.7 Tomas Berdych. On Sunday it was revealed while Nick Kyrgios was smashing his way into the quarter-finals of the Australian Open against Italy's Andreas Seppi, his mother was pacing the corridors of the Hisense Arena, too nervous to watch. Despite having arrived eight hours early to reserve front row seats for Nick's 25 schoolmates at the non-ticketed event, just 45 minutes into the game Norlaila Kyrgios walked out, unable to witness the outcome of the match.

The young tennis star served his way out of trouble to notch a magical 5-7 4-6 6-3 7-6(5) 8-6 win to overcome the Italian . Over three hours later she was crying with joy in a corner of the arena, after roars from the crowd signified her son's triumph on the court. Speaking to the Canberra Times, Norlaila said she fears she is 'jinxing' her 19-year-old son when she watches his matches, preferring to pace the corridors striking up conversation with passer-bys to take her mind off the game. 'If there's a possibility of him winning, I can't stand it. I'm so nervous. If he's the underdog I'm OK. I'm basically praying to anyone and everything to send him good vibes. If I'm watching I think maybe I'm jinxing him,' Norlaila told the publication. Kyrgios' dad George, brother Christos and sister Halimah also showed their support for Australia's golden boy on Sunday night, sitting in the players' box with his coach Todd Larkham.

Kyrgios began tennis lessons at seven years of age after his mum noticed how powerfully he would hit the ball . Kyrgios has recently drawn some criticism for his swearing and  feisty exchanges with the crowd at the Melbourne Open. The scrappy 19-year-old is facing accusations that he should have been disqualified after he swore at members of the crowd during Sunday's match. Midway through Sunday's packed match he yelled out 'turn off your f***ing phone mate' after a loud ringtone echoed through Hisense Arena. Later, when someone yelled out during a crucial serve, deep in the fifth set, he caustically fired off: 'Are you right, mate?' after losing the point. He also spotted  three spectators trying to sneak out early before he went on to stage a miracle comeback after a five-set triumph. In the heat of the moment, Kyrgios interrupted his own match as he called out at the fans: 'Oi! Where are you going?' as the crowd laughed. Back in August the mother-of-three told the Daily Mail Australia that she gets far too nervous when watching him play, instead preferring to reminisce of 'little Nick's' humble beginnings .

His doting mother acknowledged that her son can be a loose cannon on the court but defended the young star, saying she can't control his behaviour like she used to. 'I used to take away his phone when he was disrespectful on court. I can't do that now.' she said. 'People can say what they want but they can't question his guts. He's got guts, he's showed that. And he's learning that,' the mother said. Kyrgios' dad made an appearance after the match, saying how proud he was of his son. 'Unbelievable. Unbelievable. I just want to thank all the crowd - it's just unbelievable. They just got him over the line - kept him motivated,' Mr Kyrgios said. 'Thank you everybody - much appreciated and hope we could just go one more. Kyrgios' dad George and sister Hali watched from the stands as he played against Andreas Seppi in the fourth round . Nick's brother Christos Kyrgios was deep in concentration as he watched his younger brother smash his way into the quarter-final . When asked if he believed his son could pull through after being two-sets to love down, he responded: 'With the crowd pushing the way it was - his done it before - so his done it again. 'You got one more point to play I'd say. Just give it the best shot and it seems to be working for him so unbelievable.' Back in August the mother-of-three told the Daily Mail Australia that she gets far too nervous when watching him play, instead preferring to reminisce of 'little Nick's' humble beginnings. 'He started playing tennis because my eldest son, Christos who is eight years older than him, was a tennis player - but not to Nick's level,' Norlaila said. Kyrgios has attracted some criticism recently for his behaviour on the court . He celebrated his win against Andreas Seppi on Sunday at the Hisense Arena . 'He was still tubby [when he started his lessons] because he didn't like to run,' she laughed. Norlaila said she was beaming with pride and believes he will go far in his career. 'I'm super proud! But, it's not just 'proud', it's just being happy that it's jelling for him. He's thinking about the right things on court. He has lost the plot before many times because of one bad call and he'll be thinking about that and then lose the next two games when he should just move forward,' she said. 'I'm just super proud he's thinking about the game and not rushing.'

"Bryan Ferry's son Merlin has been making a steady recovery since his car crash last month. The 24-year-old was involved in a horrific three-car collision on a country lane in Shropshire, the West Midlands just before Christmas, during which he suffered multiple fractures and a head injury. Merlin - who is former Roxy Music frontman Bryan's youngest son - thankfully appears to be on the mend, with his older brother Otis keeping the family's well-wishers updated about his progress. Otis has now shared a picture of Merlin taking his first steps since the accident on Twitter. First steps: Otis Ferry has posted a picture of his brother Merlin taking his first steps since his car crash in Shropshire, the West Midlands, last month . Merlin can be seen leaning on a crutch for support as he walks down the hospital hallway. He captioned the image: 'Merlins first steps after a month in QE hospital, Nothing like a delicious curry for motivation! Thank you to all x (sic)'. Earlier this month, Bryan thanked fans for their kind messages of support after his  son's accident. Merlin was trapped in the wreckage of his silver Volvo saloon for almost an hour after the crash, which left his vehicle looking 'like a mangled box of tin'. Bryan Ferry, left, has thanked fans for their messages of support after his son Merlin, right, was in a car crash . A message posted on the former Roxy Music star's Facebook page said: 'On behalf of BF and the family, many thanks for all the kind messages of support for Merlin following his road accident before Christmas.' It went on: 'Merlin has undergone a series of operations and is now stable in hospital, with a long period of recovery ahead of him.' The message also thanked the fire and ambulance crews which helped as well as the medical staff at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. Otis described the wreckage, following the crash on the A458, half a mile to the north west of Cressage, as looking 'like a mangled box of tin'. One of the other vehicles in the tangled wreck had erupted in flames while Merlin was still trapped in his car, but a passer-by was able to quickly put out the dangerous blaze. At the time the West Midlands Ambulance service said he suffered multiple fractures to his legs, pelvis, left arm and had a head injury. The crash, which took place on the A458 near Cressage, Shropshire, left Merlin's silver Volvo saloon looking like 'a mangled box of tin'. The wreckage also involved a red Mercedes (seen on the right of the image) His eldest brother, Eton-educated Otis, informed his followers the day after the crash on December 22 and updated them on his sibling’s condition via his public Instagram page. After uploading a picture of the crash scene, he said at the time: ‘He had a head-on collision, has lots of broken bones and is having an operation on his heart as we speak. ‘He was conscious before he went into theatre and his biggest concern was that he had missed Christmas! He is in the best possible hospital for this type of procedure.’ Otis, who is master of the South Shropshire Hunt and has in the past been arrested for his pro-hunting activism, also thanked firefighters for freeing his brother from the wreck. He wrote on Twitter: ‘Thank you for extracting my brother alive from what looks like a mangled box of tin. We are all continuing to pray.’ Merlin had been travelling along the A458 about half a mile north-west of the village of Cressage, in Shropshire, at the time of the collision. Family affair: Merlin (circled) with brothers Isaac, Otis and Tara as their father Bryan received the CBE in 2011 . His car and a red Mercedes, which was travelling in the opposite direction, had collided head-on at around 6.40pm. The 49-year-old Mercedes driver from Kidderminster escaped with minor injuries. A third vehicle, a Scania lorry, which was travelling in the same direction as the Mercedes was also involved but little damage was caused to it. The driver was uninjured. Merlin, who narrowly escaped jail in 2013 after he was found carrying a knife for a second time, is one of four sons the 69-year-old has with his ex-wife, former model Lucy Helmore. Their 21-year marriage ended in divorce in 2003 while his second marriage to PR executive Amanda Sheppard, who is 38 years his junior, also ended in divorce earlier this year. The couple had separated in August last year after being married for two years. Merlin had accompanied his siblings Otis, Isaac and Tara to Buckingham Palace three years ago to see their father receive his CBE.","Merlin Ferry, 24, was involved in three-car collision just before Christmas .

"A Chinese woman so disabled with cerebral palsy that she can only properly control her left foot has stunned the world by writing 60,000 words of a fiction novel using just her toes. Hu Huiyuan grew up in a rural community in Anhui province, eastern China, where even able-bodied children struggle to get a formal education. But the now 21-year-old was so determined to learn that she taught herself to read and write using television subtitles. While she is typing, Hu needs to be fastened to her wheelchair with a belt to stabilise her. Scroll down for video . Hu Huiyuan is disabled with cerebral palsy and can only properly control her left foot. Through sheer determination, she has written 60,000 words of a fiction novel using only her toes . Hu suffers from cerebral palsy - a neurological condition that affect movement and co-ordination . The 21-year-old was so determined to learn that she taught herself to read and write using television subtitles, her parents say . Hu can now comfortably manage 20 to 30 words a minute, and has finished the sixth chapter of her eight chapter book. And her entire life story has been about defying the odds, say her parents Peng, 49, and wife Sun, 47. 'When she was born the doctors said she wouldn't survive more than a few days, but she did,' said her father, Peng. 'They didn't know what was wrong with her at first, but 10 months later they told us it was cerebral palsy. He added: 'The only parts of her body she could move were her head and her foot, but she was incredibly determined. 'She eventually learned to do all sorts of everyday tasks using just her foot.' Interviewed by local TV, Hu said: 'I teach myself. 'I'm so fascinated by the opportunities that being able to read presents. 'Being able to write allows me to communicate with so many more people. 'I'm not a genius but I'm very focused. When you have a disability like this, you have to learn patience.' The remarkable 21-year-old said: 'I'm so fascinated by the opportunities that being able to read presents. Being able to write allows me to communicate with so many more people' Now experienced at typing with her toes, Hu can comfortably manage 20 to 30 words a minute, and has finished the sixth chapter of the eight chapter book . Hu added: 'I'm not a genius but I'm very focused. When you have a disability, you have to learn patience' Cerebral palsy is the general term for a number of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination. Specifically, cerebral palsy is caused by a problem in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles, according to the NHS website. The condition can occur if the brain develops abnormally or is damaged before, during or shortly after birth. The main symptoms of cerebral palsy normally become apparent during the first three years of a child's life. They are: Muscle stiffness or floppiness, muscle weakness, random and uncontrolled body movements, balance and co-ordination problems. Some people with the condition may have communication and learning difficulties, although intelligence is often unaffected. Although she had been unable to secure a place in a school, or indeed a computer, she got round the problem by getting hold of a TV and learning from the subtitles. Her mother, Sun, said her daughter's determination had been evident from an early age. While learning to speak, which was much slower and more painstaking than it would have been for a child who was not disabled, but she said her daughter would sometimes repeat a word 1,000 times until she could say it. She added:'Typing with just your foot doesn't come easy for anyone, either.' Hu is not the only example of a disabled Chinese person who, despite the lack of facilities for disabled people in the country, often overcomes huge obstacles to achieve remarkable things. Last September, Wang Qiang, a 29-year-old man diagnosed with cerebral palsy, fulfilled his dream of joining a professional boxing competition when he signed up in the eastern city of Shanghai.

"Thieves smashed an SUV through the glass doors of a San Francisco museum and took off with 19th-century gold nuggets worth about $10,000 before dawn on Tuesday. At about 2.30am, the three men, armed with assault weapons and wearing ski masks, drove a green Chevrolet Suburban through the front of the Wells Fargo History Museum in the city's downtown Financial District. The three masked thieves held a security guard at gunpoint, took 4 to 10 ounces of gold from an exhibit case and got away in a waiting sedan, police said. The guard wasn't injured. The men fled in the second vehicle, reportedly heading east across the Bay Bridge. Scroll down for video . Three thieves, armed with assault weapons and wearing ski masks, drove a Chevrolet Suburban through the plate glass doors of the Wells Fargo History Museum in San Francisco's Financial District . Police have made no arrests so far but said that the three suspects had been driving a  white Ford Taurus. Rare coin dealer Don Kagin says the robbers may have difficulty selling the nuggets unless they melt them down. Word of the heist was spreading through the rare coin community, Kagin said, and dealers will be on the lookout for nuggets and coins with historical significance that suddenly appear on the market. The museum is on the site where the Wells Fargo Bank first opened for business in 1852. It houses 'real gold from California gold country regions', historic stagecoaches and a working telegraph, according to the museum's website. Robbers in Northern California have targeted precious metals in museum displays before and the tactics of the heist have marked other recent robberies in the area. Fred Holabird, a mining geologist and an owner of a rare and unique collectibles business in Reno, Nevada, called the theft a tragedy because the nuggets could be marked with the year and place where they were mined and even the miner who unearthed them. 'This is such bad news from my viewpoint,' he said. Wells Fargo spokesman Ruben Pulido said in a statement that the company is grateful no one was injured and no damage came to the historic stagecoaches displayed at the museum, located at the site where Wells Fargo launched in 1852. Workers remove the damaged panes following the bank robbery on Tuesday in the financial district . Workers remove a damaged pane of glass at the Wells Fargo History Museum in San Francisco on Tuesday following the theft . He would not, however, go into detail about the gold nuggets that were stolen. In addition to the stagecoach, used in the 1860s, the museum has a working telegraph and art and historical artifacts on display. With the SUV still wedged in the revolving doors on Tuesday morning, people walking to work stopped to look at the aftermath of the robbery and snap pictures, while police surveyed the damage. Shattered glass crunched underneath the tires of a tow truck pulling the green 1992 Chevrolet Suburban from the building. Gold nuggets also were taken in a September 2012 robbery at the California State Mining and Mineral Museum. Five men were convicted of stealing $1.3 million in gold, quartz and other valuable metals from the museum in the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Some of the stolen items, including a bag of ground-up quartz, were recovered. But about $12,000 worth of gold was sold to pawn shops and dealers, police said. It was the second heist that year of valuable metals in Northern California. In February 2012, thieves made off with large chunks of gold on display in a Siskiyou County courthouse. Other Bay Area robbers recently have crashed vehicles into businesses to steal merchandise. Thieves last week backed a U-Haul van through the front of a Patagonia store near San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, loaded it with high-end outdoor clothing and gear and sped off. Last year, two suspects rammed a vehicle into an upscale designer boutique in Union Square on November 26 and took handbags, police said. Thieves in May busted through the glass at the Apple Store in a bustling shopping district in nearby Berkeley to steal electronics, leaving the car behind. Police did not reveal the value of the stolen merchandise in any of the cases. A police spokesman also said it's too early to tell if the incidents last year and Tuesday's theft are linked.

"Two Turkish university students who filmed a porn movie for their dissertation say they underwent a 'four-year nightmare' after being arrested for their course work. Photographer Deniz Özgün, 26, and Elif Safak Urucu, 25, were dragged off  and interrogated after education officials reported their dissertation work to police in 2011. Despite having had their idea approved by academics at Bilgi University, Istanbul, the dissertation was instantly marked as a fail upon completion, and the pair were arrested a few days later. Naked truth: Elif Safak Urucu, 25, pictured, and Deniz Özgün, 26, were arrested after education officials in Istanbul reported their porn film dissertation  to police four years ago . Mr Özgün and Ms Urucu said they had been treated like criminals and subjected to a four-year nightmare of court cases before finally being acquitted this month. 'I discussed everything with my academic leaders before going ahead, I told them quite clearly that we wanted to make a pornographic film in order to show how synthetic the sexual scenes in it were,' Mr Özgün, now a professional photographer and designer, told an Istanbul court. Their arrests also resulted in the sacking of three academics from Bilgi University, one of Turkey's most prestigious private universities. The university, also considered the most liberal in the country,  shut its film department after the 'porn dissertation' incident.

The two explained in court how they had undergone a nightmare over the last four years and added that in addition the ordeal was unlikely to end. A lawyer for the pair, Volga Gokce, said: 'This case should never have been initiated. It was clearly an academic project sanctioned and approved by university officials and neither of these young people should be held accountable. 'They have been put under enormous psychological pressure and at the end have been left with nothing.

"Yahoo CEO Marissa Meyer is spinning off the company's prized stake in China's Alibaba Group Holding in a move that will let Yahoo avoid paying billions in future taxes. A newly formed entity called SpinCo will inherit ownership of Yahoo's 384 million Alibaba shares when the tax-free spin-off is completed toward the end of this year. The stock of the new company will be distributed pro rata to Yahoo shareholders, resulting in SpinCo becoming a separate publicly traded company. A newly formed entity called SpinCo will inherit ownership of Yahoo's 384 million Alibaba shares when the tax-free spin-off is completed toward the end of this year. Alibaba operates an online ecosystem that lets individuals and small businesses buy and sell. It doesn't directly sell anything, compete with its merchants, or hold inventory. It has been described as China's answer to eBay, but it actually handles more packages annually than eBay and Amazon combined. Most of Alibaba's 279 million active buyers visit the sites at least once a month on smartphones and other mobile devices, making the company attractive to investors as computing shifts away from laptop and desktop machines. Alibaba has come to power four-fifths of all online commerce conducted in China and has also branched out into areas such as e-payments and financial investment. If Alibaba were a country, its GDP would be above Vietnam and just below New Zealand. Tuesday's much-anticipated announcement about the management of Yahoo's 15 percent stake in Alibaba overshadowed Yahoo's results for the final three months of last year. Yahoo's current market value is $45 billion, of which $40 billion is in Alibaba shares. 'We have actively engaged experts in tax-efficient structures over the past two years and have considered a variety of alternatives,' Yahoo chief finance officer Ken Goldman said in a statement. 'We remain aligned with our shareholders and our plan is designed to achieve the most advantageous return of capital to Yahoo shareholders with the absolute highest probability of success.' Yahoo will continue to operate its core business and hold its 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan. Yahoo said separately its profit in the fourth quarter fell 52 percent from a year ago to $166 million while revenue was essentially flat at $1.25 billion. 'I'm pleased to report that our performance in the fourth quarter and in 2014 continues to show stability in our core business,' said chief executive Marissa Mayer. 'Our mobile strategy and focus has transformed Yahoo and yielded significant results.' Investments in Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan are the main reason Yahoo's stock has more than tripled since Mayer defected from Google to become Yahoo's CEO two-and-half years ago. Yahoo is retaining its nearly 36 percent stake in Yahoo Japan. The handling of Yahoo's Alibaba stake is so important to shareholders that one activist investor, hedge fudge manager Jeffrey Smith of Starboard Value, has threatened to spearhead an attempt to oust Mayer if she didn't adopt a strategy that minimizes taxes. Smith also has been pressuring Mayer to commit to returning most of any future Alibaba windfalls instead of spending the money to buy other companies — unless she embraces his call for Yahoo to merge with rival AOL Inc. A tax-free spin-off of the Alibaba stake ranked high on Smith's agenda. Other stockholders also liked Mayer's decision. Yahoo's stock gained $3.49, or more than 7 percent, to $51.48 in extended trading. The website, which aims to connect companies with wholesalers, is known for selling everything - including some strange offerings. One company in particular, Zhongshan City Elephant Sculpture Art, is leading the way with its silicone-wax celebrity statues. A popular piece is the life-size, obese statue of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The sculpture is completely naked, apart from shotgun and sunglasses, and it could be yours for £9,900 ($16,800). In the event you need the services of a camel, then you can purchase 500 for around £350 ($600) each. With many of the items bulk buy, your will need to order 24,000 pieces to get your hand on what is described as 'lovely used panties'.

But if beauty products are more your thing, then Alibaba has some intriguing offers. The female electric nose lifter, for instance, promises to give you a firmer, higher nose by zapping it with vibrations for just three minutes a day. Not to be left out, there is also a wide array of male grooming product for sale. Lovers of Apple products, who also happen to have an embarrassing ear wax problem, can get their hands on a Steve Jobs-banded ear cleaner tool set. The pack contains eight items for ear cleaning and manicuring and is priced at 50p ($0.8) at a minimum order of 2,000 sets.","Newly formed  SpinCo will inherit ownership of Yahoo's 384 million shares .

"Cyclists are being warned over the dangers of using apps Strava and MapMyRide after it was revealed that thieves are using them to find out where they live and steal their expensive bikes. The apps are used to record detailed route maps using satellites as well as average speed, elevation and the number of calories burned - which can be stored publicly and seen by other users. With many cyclists including details of their bike's make and model and then starting the apps' recording from their home, burglars are given the luxury of being able to pick and choose their targets. Cyclists who use apps that use detailed map recordings are being warned to check their privacy settings . It is also thought that thieves are using Facebook and Twitter accounts, where people often post pictures of their bikes, to gain information and then search the apps for their potential address. Sergeant Rob Danby, from Humberside Police and part of the Riverside neighbourhood policing team, which covers Hull city centre, is warning people to ensure privacy settings are activated. He said: 'Members of the public should take care when using apps such as Strava to ensure they do not inadvertently give away private information and locations. 'Such apps can give criminals a clue to where valuable items may be stored.' The force does not collect data showing how burglaries have occurred, but cycling shop owners say that according to their customers, apps are increasingly being blamed for break-ins. Wayne Preston, of Cliff Pratt Cycles in  Hull, said: 'People who have had bikes stolen come into the shop and we get into the conversation of what happened. Cyclist apps Strava (left) and MapMyRide (right) help riders to record information such as distance, average speed, elevation and how many calories they have burned. But it uses a map which can be accessed publicly . 'In some cases, people have not activated the privacy settings on Strava.' Mr Preston is also warning over the dangers of using social media to 'advertise' expensive bicycles. 'I don't have any pictures of my bikes on Facebook, but I know people do,' he said. 'People happily put photos of their shining £3,000 bike up for everyone to see.' When criminals spot a bike they like they can search Strava for that person's name and, if privacy settings are not enabled, they have a potential address where the person begins and ends their rides. Mr Preston said: 'The best advice I can give is if you are going to use apps make sure you switch it off a good distance from your house. 'Personally, I would much rather lose a mile off my Strava record than have my house or garage burgled and my bikes stolen.' Strava, MapMyRide and various other so-called 'cyclist apps' work on a very similar basis. Their point? To allow riders to record their activity on a range of compatible GPS devices, including iPhone, Android, some fitness watches and Google Glass. The kind of data they can record include the distance and where the cyclist has been on a detailed map - pinpointing exactly where the rider has been from start to end. Calories burned, duration, speed, elevation and pace are also among the features it can track. Some even give suggested routes, uploaded by other users. Cyclists can then browse, analyse and compare their efforts with previous ones as well as other users and challenge themselves to do better. Their results can also be shared with friends and ranked on a leaderboard. There is a range of privacy settings so users can make their profile secure, including abbreviating your name and approving users before they follow your account. Luke Anderson, manager of Freetown Sports, also in the city, said he was  aware of criminals using apps. 'It is definitely happening,' he said. 'There is the option to block your start point and people need to use it. 'Bikes are expensive. We sell some worth up to £4,000. You need to protect them.' Between September 2013 and September last year, bike theft increased by 15 per cent across the Humberside Police area. Sgt Danby reinforced the need to ensure bikes, when stored in sheds or even homes, are properly secured. 'A lot of people keep bikes in sheds with minimal security,' he said. 'People need to be wary about where and how they store their bikes. 'We've known people to use a £2 lock to secure a bike worth £4,000. They won't spend £50 on a decent lock.' Sgt Danby advised that bikes should be chained to something difficult to move inside the shed and these should also be fitted with good-quality locks with an alarm. 'Some people install CCTV, or put up a dummy camera, which can be effective,' he said. He added that frame numbers should be entered on to the online database Immobilise - a website used by police forces across the country - which will help reunite recovered bikes with their owners. Simon Klima, UK Country Manager at Strava, said: 'We believe it is important that our members have the tools to protect themselves and control the detail of information they share. 'While we have not been able to confirm any cases of theft related to Strava activity uploads, we do offer a rich set of easy-to-use privacy controls for all our members. 'As a leading social platform for athletes, Strava gives members the tools to manage the information they share with friends and followers. 'They can set privacy zones around any address such as home or office addresses, so that start and end locations of their activities aren't shared publicly.'","Apps are used to record detailed map routes, average speed and elevation .

"We've all been there after a big night out, or a lazy Sunday morning. Feeling a bit worse for wear and wanting the only thing can provide the cure - a great mound of fast-food delivered straight to the door. And now, thanks to  Alex Howsam's One Delivery franchise - delivering well-known takeaways and meals straight to the sofa -  those needs can be catered for.

"One of four boys who fell into an icy pond outside Baltimore over the weekend has died, authorities said on Tuesday. Kyron Aikens, 13, died sometime Monday night or early on Tuesday morning while being treated in the pediatric intensive care unit at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said Cpl. John Wachter, a spokesman for Baltimore County Police Department. Kyron and three other boys, ages 8 to 12, fell through ice into a pond Sunday afternoon near a high school. Scroll down for video . Dead: Kyron Aikens, 13, died sometime Monday night or early on Tuesday morning after falling into a frozen lake with too thin ice . Thin Ice: One of four boys who fell in this frozen pond over the weekend, 13-year-old Kyron Aikens, has died . Tragic: Kyron Aikens' death could have been prevented had he not made the decision with friends to walk across the icy water too weak to hold his weight . Bystanders pulled a 12-year-old boy from the water, while the two other boys made it to the shore on their own. Witnesses said that almost immediately after falling through the ice, Kyron went under the water, said Lt. Norm Simpkins Jr. of the Arbutus Volunteer Fire Department, one of the first responders at the scene. 'They said he went in and they did not see him come up at all,' Simpkins said. 'He never resurfaced.' Rescue crews in boats combed the murky, 8-foot-deep pond using poles in hopes of finding Kyron before divers arrived and joined the search underwater, Simpkins said. He said one of his crew members found Kyron using a pole, and that a diver brought him up soon after that. Kyron was pulled from the water unconscious and undergoing cardiac arrest about 80 minutes after crews were first dispatched to the scene, according to a Baltimore County police timeline of the rescue. Simpkins said it was unclear why Kyron was unable to make it out of the water, adding that it may be that the teen didn't know how to swim or that he got trapped beneath the ice and couldn't find an opening in time. Rushed to safety: Kyron Aikens suffered cardiac arrest and was rushed to the hospital where he later died . Walk of danger: A show remains on the icy pond where four boys decided to walk across, putting all of their lives in danger and leading to one's untimely death . Safety measures: Fire officials warned to never walk on frozen ponds because the ice may be too thin and it . The boy saved by bystanders, 12-year-old Chive Omar Benjamin, also was in cardiac arrest after being rescued and remained in serious condition Tuesday at Johns Hopkins. Two boys, Junior Wilbert Thomas, 8, and Jujuan Wilder, 12, were transported to St. Agnes Hospital and have been released. ABC  reports that witnesses said  they saw four boys walking across the pond when they fell through thin ice just one to two inches thick. Two boys were able to make it to the shore but the other two were not as lucky. The witnesses were able to pull out Benjamin, who was unconscious. A bystander said he handed his dog's leash to someone on shore then went in to grab Benjamin and take him safely to the shore. Aikens wasn't pulled out until an hour later by rescue crews wearing special water vision goggles and when they found him he was under cardiac arrest. 'You couldn't even see your hand in your face,' said Lt. Norman Simpkins, Arubutus VFC. 'Our swift water team was able to get out and start poking around with tools that we have on our units to try to find or see if we can feel for at the bottom of a pond what may have been the body.' Fire fighters said that this boy's death exemplifies why walking on frozen ponds are never safe because while they may appear to be solid the ice may be very thin and susceptible to breaking.

"Veteran Jamie Streets is facing homelessness with his  and young family after Cornwall County Council told him he was not eligible for accommodation . Furious veterans have criticised the Prime Minister and a local council after a war hero, who was discharged from the army because he had cancer, is facing homelessness with his wife and four children because he was told he was not eligible for a council house. Jamie Streets spent 15 years in the army - completing tours of Kosovo and Afghanistan and also serving as a guard to the Queen. But after the 34-year-old developed a brain tumour he was medically discharged from the army last year and relocated to live with his young family - including his two-year-old daughter - in Falmouth. He still has part of the tumour in his head that medics were unable to remove. However he has since been told he will not be allowed a council house and will be turfed out of his temporary accommodation in just four weeks - after Cornwall County Council refused to give them a permanent home. The decision does not comply with the Armed Forces Covenant, introduced by the Prime Minister in 2011, to support members of the forces who have left the army to ensure they are supported and not disadvantaged - particularly if they have been injured. In an open letter to Mr Cameron and Andrew Kerr, leader of Cornwall County Council, veterans from the Household Cavalry Association in North West and West Yorkshire, said they were 'angry and incensed' by the decision. The letter said: 'This is not acceptable treatment for one of our brothers who has served his Queen and country with impeccable professionalism for over 15 years, and who would have completed 22 years of service, given the opportunity.' It calls on officials to reverse the decision to ensure that Mr Street, his wife Charmaine and their children are not rendered homeless because of a 'ridiculous red tape issue.' Mr Street (top right), his wife Charmaine (centre) and their four children face being left without a home . Mr and Mrs Streets were told they would be moved from their temporary accommodation within a month after their housing bid was turned down. They did have a private landlord but moved out because they couldn't afford the rent and were given a temporary home. But because they left the private rental voluntarily they have been accused of intentionally making themselves homeless and have been denied any other accommodation. Mrs Streets said: 'My husband is a proud man and didn't want bailiffs and the police turning up at the door so we did the honourable thing but in the council's eyes that was not the right thing to do. They say we have made ourselves intentionally homeless. 'They are throwing me, my husband and four children out on the streets so we are going to be homeless - who do we turn to?' Mr Streets spent 15 years in the army and would have served for 22 years had he not been medically discharged after suffering a malignant brain tumour . Mr and Mrs Streets have four children - Suvannah, two, Briea, nine, Leo, 13 and Tyler, 15. Their problems started when Mr Streets suffered an accident and was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Mr Streets served 15 years in the army - first in the Household Cavalry Regiment where he went to Kosovo and Afghanistan. When he returned in 2008, he took up ceremonial duties with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, but it was after being thrown twice from a horse that he was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. He underwent surgery which left his speech affected and with no movement in his left side. After four weeks in hospital and rehabilitation he returned to work. However, a seizure suffered a year later led to the end of his Army career as he was medically discharged in May 2014 - against his wishes. Mrs Streets added: 'Jamie wanted to serve 22 years in the army and we had planned to buy our own home, but it didn't happen that way. He adored his job - he was army barmy - but he lost it through medical reasons. 'Are we expected to walk the streets with our four children? The kids are worried and it's putting a big strain on us as a family.' Since he was discharged from the Army Mr Streets' payments have dwindled because he has been unable to find work. He has received his driving licence back, after the DVLA took it away because if his seizures and has enrolled on a plumbing course - hopeful of finding work. A spokesman for Cornwall Housing said it did not comment on individual cases but said they may provide temporary accommodation until housing can be found. He said:  'It is important to understand that being provided with temporary accommodation by the council is not a guarantee that permanent council or housing association accommodation will be offered.' The Household Cavalry Association of North West and West Yorkshire have also launched an online petition calling for action to prevents Mr Streets and his family from being left homeless. A Government spokesman said they would be looking into the case 'urgently.' He told the Daily Express: 'We changed the law so that seriously injured serving personnel and former servicemen and women with urgent housing needs must always be given top priority.' Dear Sirs, . We are ex soldiers representing the Household Cavalry Veterans Association and need to tell you how very angry and incensed we are with Cornwall Council and Downing Street this weekend. Yes I know you are all busy spending tax payers' money on lavish lifestyles (Councillors) and dishing out foreign aid, however, we have some serious issues on our own doorstep that are NOT being resolved. It has come to light that one of our colleagues and fellow Household Cavalryman, Jamie Street, who was medically discharged from the British Army in 2014 with the Rank of Corporal of Horse (COH), is to be evicted from his council house along with his wife and four young children in one month by Cornwall Council. Their application for a permanent council house was rejected due to some ridiculous red tape issue. Maybe he would stand a better chance if he was a foreign refugee or asylum seeker. Perhaps Cornwall Council, and its leader Andrew Kerr haven't heard of the Armed Forces Covenant. And perhaps it would be courteous of Downing Street to reply to Jamie's letters sent via email, one on the 9th and the other on the 20th January, 2015. I also hear that Conservative MP for Falmouth, Sarah Newton, was unable to offer any plausible assistance. Yeah right. Veterans have said they are 'incensed' by the treatment of war hero Jamie Streets and called upon David Cameron to act so he and his family are not made homeless by the council's decision . Let me tell you about Jamie. He joined the Army in 1998 at Winchester ATR initially with Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, where he completed two tours of Kosovo, one in 2000 and the other in 2001. Later in 2001, he rebadged to The Household Cavalry as a Life Guard based at the armoured regiment in Windsor. In 2007, he was deployed to Afghanistan on Op Herrick for a 6 month tour as a CVR(T) Reconnaissance Crew Commander. After returning from Afghanistan, Jamie volunteered for ceremonial duties at Knightsbridge, where he was a troop COH, and carried out a wide range of duties including but not limited to Queens Life Guard, trooping of the colour, state visits and Sovereign escort. Jamie was involved in a riding accident where he was thrown from his horse and smashing his head off a fence, suffering from serious head injuries which resulted in a malignant brain tumour. He underwent surgery which affected his walking and speech and left him with no movement in his left side, he also contracted Meningitis. But after four weeks in hospital with rehabilitation, at Headley Court, he returned to work. However, Jamie suffered a seizure the following year which later led to the end of his Army career. He was medically discharged in May 2014, against his wishes. Jamie still has part of the tumour in his head, as they were unable to remove all of the cancer cells. The family moved to Falmouth, the children were enrolled at local schools and they moved into their private rented accommodation. Since then, his Army funds have dwindled as Jamie, 34, has been unable to find work. The DVLA has returned his driving licence and he has enrolled on a plumbing course with the hope he can support his family again. But in the meantime, they are facing the prospect of being homeless. Why? I speak for all veterans of the Household Cavalry and wider military family when we say that this is not acceptable treatment for one of our brothers who has served his Queen and country with impeccable professionalism for over 15 years, and who would have completed 22 years of service, given the opportunity. We implore you Mr Cameron and Mr Kerr to act now to ensure Jamie Street and his family are given appropriate housing so they can get on with their lives and bring up their children in a safe environment.

"'All it takes is basic human decency': But Baroness Newlove said complaints about poor treatment by officialdom are still not being properly handled . Police, prosecutors and the courts are still failing to show enough compassion to victims of crime, a scathing report warned last night. The Victims’ Commissioner Baroness Newlove – whose husband Garry was killed by a gang of yobs – said complaints about poor treatment by officialdom are not being properly handled. Those who spoke out, including people who had been violently attacked or lost a loved one, said they were left feeling ‘dismissed’, ‘confused’ or ‘unimportant’. Ministers have repeatedly promised to make the justice system more considerate of victims and Tory peer Helen Newlove, 53, was appointed to check its progress. However, in her first report, she found almost 75 per cent of victims who complained about the handling of their case were unhappy with the response. Baroness Newlove said: ‘It is shocking how many victims told me how ignored, dismissed and confused they felt when they tried to raise concerns about their treatment. ‘All it takes is basic human decency to explain to a victim, in a sensitive and timely way, why something has gone wrong and what they can do about it. ‘I have seen excellent examples of work by agencies across the country but it’s clear that many victims are still not getting the service they deserve. The review found that there was ‘inadequate attention to the personal touch victims need’ One victim told Baroness Newlove: ‘I’m just frightened... I think they will harass me if I complain about the way they have treated me and my daughter.’ Another said: ‘I raised concerns about the process, the process was almost worse than the actual journey of being a victim.’ Baroness Newlove’s husband was murdered by yobs outside his home when he confronted a gang who were vandalising his car in Warrington, Cheshire in 2007. He was kicked ‘like a football’, dying in hospital three days later. Her report was backed by victims’ rights campaigner Maggie Hughes, whose son Robert was left with brain damage after being stabbed with a broken bottle and having his head stamped upon in 2008. She said it was ‘crucial’ for the authorities to start listening. She added: ‘We victims are not just complainers. If anything, we are thrown into a new world of rules and regulations and then into a dark labyrinth of the unknown. ‘If we feel that we are not satisfied with a service, then we should be able to get clear guidelines on how to complain, regular updates and a full explanation of the outcome.” Justice? Those who spoke out in Baroness Newlove's report, including people who had been violently attacked or lost a loved one, said they were left feeling ‘dismissed’, ‘confused’ or ‘unimportant’ Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: ‘This is a damning indictment of the way victims and witnesses have been let down by David Cameron’s Government. ‘We cannot go on treating victims as an afterthought or worse still ignoring them altogether. Victims losing confidence in our justice system leads to crimes going unreported and witnesses not providing evidence. ‘If victims give up on reporting matters and helping in prosecutions it could lead to the wheels of our justice system grinding to a halt leaving criminals roaming the streets.’ The Ministry of Justice said more money than ever before was being made available to support victims, with a potential budget of £100million. Officials also highlighted steps to allow vulnerable witnesses to give evidence from outside the courtroom and plans to establish a new Victims’ Information Service by March 2015. Victims’ Minister Mike Penning said: ‘I want to put the highest emphasis on the needs of victims, and an important part of that is making sure the criminal justice system always listens to what they have to say and treats them with the utmost respect and sensitivity. ‘To help achieve this I have already committed to enshrining their rights in law. We have also significantly strengthened their entitlements in the Victims’ Code, and are reviewing whether new powers are needed so that they can better hold the system to account.’","Nearly three-quarters of victims who complain about the handling of their cases are unhappy with the response they get from officials, report says .

"A photograph of a mother breastfeeding her 16-month-old son in the bath was flagged to Facebook because it apparently violated the company's policy on nudity. Kaya Wright said she was 'disappointed' when she was sent a notification by the social networking site to say the image was being 'reviewed'. The message came even though Mrs Wright, who works as a nurse, posted the picture on a closed page for a group of breastfeeding mothers. Scroll down for videos . Reported: Kaya Wright, pictured with sons Daniel, five, and 16-month-old Kayden. The 32-year-old said she was 'disappointed' when she was sent a notification by Facebook to say her photo was being 'reviewed' The decision prompted other members of the group, Liverpool Community BAMBIS (Babies and Mums Breastfeeding Information and Support), to upload their own breastfeeding photographs in a show of solidarity with Mrs Wright. Another mother on the group described the reporting of breastfeeding images as 'common'. Mrs Wright, who works as a nurse, told the Liverpool Echo: 'At first I thought it was a joke. Facebook said the image had been reported for nudity but you really couldn't see anything. 'Then I was a bit disappointed at the thought that someone in the group had reported the image.' 'It's a breastfeeding group, so what do you expect? Some of my friends thought that maybe it had been reported by mistake.' 'Violation': Mrs Wright, who works as a nurse, posted this photo of herself breastfeeding Kayden on a members-only group. Other women came out in solidarity with Mrs Wright, posting their own images . Notification: Clare Riley, left with her five-month-old daughter Imogen, was told this photo, right, was being reviewed by Facebook's community team after being reported for violating their standards on nudity . BAMBIS works with Liverpool Women's Hospital and in local children's centres to encourage breastfeeding. When Mrs Wright, 32, told the group what had happened, dozens of other mothers started to post their own breastfeeding photographs. Mrs Wright, who also has a five-year-old son, Daniel, added: 'I tried to breastfeed Daniel but it didn't work out. But it was completely different with Kayden. 'Breastfeeding is amazing, everyone should try it. But in this country I've noticed there is a different attitude to breastfeeding. 'Ever since Kayden was born, people have kept asking me when are you going to bottle feed. Facebook has come under fire on a number of occasions over its strict policy on nudity. Up until last summer, the guidelines - designed to stop users sharing pornographic images and explicit photos of minors - also included a complete ban on photos of mothers breastfeeding, deeming them 'inappropriate'. The policy, which can be viewed online, now states that the company 'aspires' to allow users to share photographs of personal importance, such as those of a mother breastfeeding her child. Despite this, some mothers still report that their breastfeeding photographs are flagged up to Facebook by other users. There have also been complaints by parents posting innocent photographs of their children in swimsuits - with the social networking site claiming they breach the rules. 'Breastfeeding is hard and it's made ever harder by other people's perceptions. I think breastfeeding should be taught in schools to raise more awareness. Later, Facebook contacted Mrs Wright to say they would not be removing the picture as it did not violate their rules on nudity. One member of the group described the issue surrounding breastfeeding images as 'common', and said that an image she posted had also been reported by another user. Clare Riley, 39, posted a photograph of herself breastfeeding her five-month-old daughter Imogen on another group for new mothers - but said it was reported to Facebook in less than 12 hours. The mother-of-three said she was 'sick' and 'disgusted' when she received a message from the site saying her photograph was being 'reviewed'. She told MailOnline: 'I don't expose myself when I breastfeed. I don't do it for attention. I do it to discreetly feed by child'. Ms Riley said she received an email the following day from Facebook informing her that it would not be deleted. On the website, Facebook states that it has a 'strict' policy against the sharing of 'pornographic content' and 'any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved'. But it adds it 'aspires to respect people's right to share content of personal importance... like family photos of a child breastfeeding'. Solidarity: Two of the breastfeeding photographs that were uploaded in a show of support for Mrs Wright . Support: The image was posted on a private members' group for mothers, pictured. BAMBIS works with Liverpool Women's Hospital and in local children's centres to encourage breastfeeding . Mrs Wright added that part of the issue was the 'sexualisation' of breastfeeding in Western culture. She said: 'In the Western world breasts are sexualised, you see celebrities with their boobs out so people associate them with sex. 'But people need to remember that first and foremost breasts are for feeding babies.' Last month, new mother Lou Burns made headlines when she was asked by staff at Claridge's to cover herself up while breastfeeding her then 12-week-old daughter Isadora. Staff at the five-star hotel in Mayfair told Mrs Burns, 35, to use the napkin to avoid ‘causing offence’ to other guests. And although she is smiling in this picture she posted on Twitter, the mother of three said she felt humiliated and burst into tears afterwards. Upset: Lou Burns, 35, was breastfeeding her 12-week-old baby (left) at the luxury Claridge's hotel in Mayfair when waiters told her to cover up with a large napkin (right) to avoid 'causing offence' to fellow guests . Mrs Burns said the baby was not comfortable with the napkin over its head and was not able to feed properly. Finally the management said she could continue without it as long as there were no complaints from anyone else. She said the hotel knocked some money off the bill and apologised for upsetting her. According to the Equality Act of 2010, it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. Outrage: Prestigious hotel Claridge's was criticised after staff ordered Ms Burns, 35, to cover herself up . However, last September a breastfeeding mother claimed today that she was ordered to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for a breakfast. Olivia Pozniak, a single 25-year-old, was feeding her 11-week-old son Louie at the Furze Wren pub owned by J D Wetherspoon in Bexleyheath, Kent, when she was told to cover up. Meanwhile in August Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told by a lifeguard at Middleton Pool that she could not breastfeed her five-month-old daughter Olive because it was 'classed as eating and drinking'. In June, a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant. Carrie Davies, 27, was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son Trystan. Embarrassed: Mrs Burns, who was dining with her mother, sister and 12-week old daughter Isadora, said she was left so embarrassed by the incident that she would never return to the five star hotel . Ms Davies, who was lunching with a friend, was offered a spot by the restaurant's toilets, which bosses at the restaurant say was more 'convenient' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there. It comes after around 70 women descended on Sports Direct in Nottingham city centre in April to show support for 25-year-old Wioletta Komar, who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son. She claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'. The sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to McDonald's which had a baby and mother room.","User reported breastfeeding photo as it possibly violated nudity policy .

"Pinned face down in the middle of the street by four rag-tag militants, the condemned man struggles for his life, screaming for help that bystanders dare not give. As an executioner looks on, his helpers finally manage to immobilise the victim - who has not even the scant comfort of a blindfold - with three on the man's body and a fourth pulling his head to expose his neck. In an instant the executioner swings a cruel, curved blade. The struggling abruptly ends and the sandy street beneath the condemned man is stained with a burst of crimson blood. Murder: The moment before the condemned man was beheaded in the street in Al-Shadadi, north-east Syria . This was the gruesome scene that unfolded yesterday in Al-Shadadi, a town of 25,000 in north-east Syria, as Islamist militants enforced the hardline religious law of their self-styled Caliphate. Dozens of bystanders watched the victim - whose crime is not known - as he screamed for help. But none dared intervene against the armed religious fanatics who now control their town. The United Nations human rights watchdog last week warned that Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq had been meting out 'cruel and inhuman' punishments to victims accused of violating their interpretation of sharia law. The group had posted photos of two men being crucified for alleged banditry, women stoned to death after accusations of adultery, and men thrown from a tall building after claims they were homosexuals, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said. 'Educated, professional women, particularly women who have run as candidates in elections for public office seem to be particularly at risk,' said Ravina Shamdasani of the OHCHR. 'In just the first two weeks of this year, reports indicate that three female lawyers were executed.' Struggle: The victim had screamed for help and fought the militants who pinned him down to be killed . Yesterday's execution in Al-Shadadi, the latest Islamic State atrocity to be captured on video, echoes similar scenes in Saudi Arabia last week where a woman was publicly beheaded as she screamed her innocence. An executioner in Mecca, the Islamic holy city, took two swings to hack off Layla bint Abdul Mutaleb Bassim's head, after she was found guilty raping her six-year-old daughter with a broomstick then beating her to death. The incident has sparked outrage in the country, but not because of the brutal punishment meted out. Rather Saudis were up in arms that the execution was filmed and posted online, where the woman's family might see it. Since Saudi Arabia's new King Salman was crowned last Friday three more people have been beheaded in the kingdom, bringing the number of executions carried out by the staunch U.S. ally this year up to 16, according to an AFP tally. Under the previous king, Abdullah, the number of executions jumped from 27 in 2010 to around 80 annually, with 87 last year.","Gruesome video recorded in Al-Shadadi, north-east Syria, yesterday .

"The pastel-coloured orchid mantis has fascinated naturalists for more than a century. It was popularly thought that the insect, whose legs are flattened and heart-shaped to resemble petals, simply mimics an orchid, allowing it to 'hide' and catch prey. But it's only now that scientists suggested that the mantis doesn’t simply blend into flowers, but is attractive to insects in its own right, sometimes preferring to remain more easily visible on leaves. Scroll down for video . Pastel predator: Scientists have suggested that the orchid mantis (stock image) doesn't simply camoflague by sitting on orchids, but is attractive to insects in its own right, sometimes preferring to remain more easily visible on leaves . Naturalists had assumed that the orchid mantis (Hymenopus coronatus) had evolved to mimic the flower as a form of crypsis – enabling it to hide among its petals, feeding upon insects that are attracted by the flower, The Conversation reported. Cryptic mimicry by predators is well known. For example, crab spiders camouflage themselves against a flower and can change from yellow to white to match their host flower. While the orchid mantis does seem to fit into this category, there was no evidence to support the hypothesis. Orchid mantises are rare in their native Malaysia and Indonesia, so their behaviour is hardly known about, except in captivity. For example, nobody knows exactly which flower the mantis is supposed to mimic, Dr James Gilbert, an insect evolutionary ecology expert at the University of Sussex wrote. When paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat, insects approached mantises more often than flowers, showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves, rather than simply camouflaging among the flora, the study revealed. Here, an orchid mantis eats a Tiger heliconian butterfly in Malaysia . The rare orchid mantis is native to rainforests in Southeast Asia. Its four walking legs resemble flower petals. The insect has evolved to mimic a generic flower, rather than an orchid. The toothed front pair are used to grasp prey. However, it doesn't 'hide' in similarly coloured flowers, but can attract insects in its own right. Their bright colouring is thought to appeal to its prey. The compact brains of insects use a rule of thumb - anything matching colour X is a nectar-containing flower – and the predator uses ‘sensory exploitation’ to catch its victims. Orchid mantises show some of the most pronounced sexual dimorphism of any species of mantis, with males less than half the size of females. Now a set of new studies shows that while the mantis does indeed look like a flower, it doesn’t hide in an orchid. In fact, it doesn’t hide at all and doesn’t look particularly like an orchid to insects. Dr James O'Hanlon of Macquarie University, Australia, set about systematically testing the ideas contained within the traditional view of the orchid mantis' modus operandi. First, they tested whether mantises actually camouflage amongst flowers, or, alternatively, attract insects on their own. For a flower-seeking insect, as predicted, the mantis' colour pattern is indistinguishable from most common flowers. However, when paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat, insects approached mantises more often than flowers, showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves, rather than simply camouflaging among the flora. ‘We can clearly observe insects, like bees, diverging from their flight paths and flying right towards this deceptive predator,’ Dr O’Hanlon said. Orchid mantises are actually very rare in the field, so their behaviour is hardly known about, except in captivity. For example, nobody knows exactly which flower the mantis is supposed to mimic. This stock image shows a pale yellow orchid mantis, ready to strike . ‘These beasties are marvellous for this kind of question, because we can observe a dynamic interaction between predators and prey.’ This phenomenon, known as aggressive mimicry, occurs in other animals. For example, the Bolas spider releases chemicals that imitate sex pheromones released by female moths seeking a mate. The orchid mantis uses aggressive mimicry to attract dinner. The Bolas spider (stock image) uses this technique to release chemicals that imitate sex pheromones released by female moths seeking a mate. Male moths, can detect these pheromones from miles away and are lured in to their death . Male moths, with their elaborately plumed antennae, can detect these pheromones from miles away, and are lured in to their death. Carnivorous Photuris firefly females can mimic the flash-responses of a different species of firefly, attracting amorous males who find themselves on the menu. Next the researchers assessed where mantises chose to sit. Surprisingly mantises did not choose to hide among the flowers and selected leaves just as often. Sitting near flowers did bring benefits, though, because insects were attracted to the general vicinity. When they compared the mantis’s shape and colour with flowers from an insect’s perspective, the predator did not resemble an orchid or indeed any particular species of flower, but rather a ‘generalised’ flower. Photuris fireflies (SEM image shown) can mimic the flash-responses of a different species of firefly, attracting amorous males to their deaths. This fits with what scientists already know: that some of the best mimics in nature are imperfect mimics with characteristics of several ‘model’ species. Placing experimental plastic models out in the field, the researchers found that mantis colour was much more important than shape in attracting insects. They believe that mantises may not actually precisely mimic a particular kind of flower. Instead they may exploit a loophole created by evolutionary efficiency savings within the insect brain. The compact brains of insects use a rule of thumb - anything matching colour X is a nectar-containing flower – and the predator uses ‘sensory exploitation’ to catch its victims. Sensory exploitation is a concentrated mass of the right colour. The insect classifies the mantis as a giant nectar-filled flower and approaches to investigate – to its doom. The white crab spider also lures prey using sensory exploitation. It reflects strongly in UV light, making it highly conspicuous to wandering insects. A flower with a crab spider is more attractive than one without, because the crab spider mimics UV-reflective floral patterns that guide insects to nectar. But the orchid mantis is the first animal ever shown to mimic an entire flower, attracting insects on its own. The findings have left experts questioning why the orchid mantis’ body parts resemble petals, if it can attract insects with its colour alone. Commenting on the research, Martin Stevens, an expert on animal deception and mimicry at of Exeter University, said: ‘My guess is that the pollinators are initially attracted at a distance through sensory exploitation, but then more accurate mimicry kicks in at close range, when the insects can inspect the mantis more closely for what it is.’","The orchid mantis is native to Malaysia and Indonesia, but it's rare .

"Ride-sharing company Lyft is getting a facelift in the form of a haircut. The San Francisco-based firm has ditched its iconic 3ft-wide fluffy pink mustaches. Instead, the easy-to-spot decoration adorning the front grilles of Lyft cars has been replaced with a 5in-long plastic replica which goes on the dashboard. The new mascots light up so customers can differentiate Lyft vehicles at night. All gone: Ride-sharing company Lyft  has ditched its iconic 3ft-wide fluffy pink mustache logo . Sleeker look: Lyft co-founder John Zimmer displays his company's new mascot - a 5in-long plastic replica of the original fluffy mustache which goes on the dashboard . About 300 employees picked up the more discreet 'glowstaches' from the company's San Francisco headquarters on Monday. Commenting on the haircut, a representative for Lyft said: 'The new glowstache marks an exciting moment for Lyft as we embark on the next chapter of our growth. 'We’ll begin rolling the glowstache out to Lyft drivers across the country in the coming weeks.' Lyft is one of several companies that allow customers to use a smartphone app to book and pay for rides in a private car. It currently operates in more than 50 U.S. cities. The big pink mustaches were introduced as part of Lyft's launch effort in 2012. Makeover: About 300 employees picked up the more discreet 'glowstaches' from the company's San Francisco headquarters on Monday . However, the symbol stuck around longer than expected because it continued to create hype. More importantly, Lyft president John Zimmer said the gimmick made people smile. However, recently it was decided a makeover was needed. Jesse McMillin, the company’s new creative director, told Wired.com: 'A lot of times you’d see people driving around and [the fluffy pink mustache] was cockeyed, or matted, or windblown.' Lyft phased out the original mustaches a few months back in place of the sleeker glowstaches. Lyft users open an app on their iOS or Android smartphones and signal drivers to pick them up and take them to their destinations. The app matches them with the nearest driver. Drivers attach  pink mustaches to their cars to identify themselves to passengers. Instead of using official taxi operators or limousine service drivers, Lyft recruits regular people who wish to make extra money by offering rides in their own cars in exchange for 'donations' from passengers. Some of Lyft's NYC founding drivers include a NY firefighter, a mother going back to school who runs a youth organization that revolves around teens and art, a honor student & MTA maintenance worker using Lyft to help pay off loans, a school teacher and father of three sons who are all actors, and a space suit designer . Drivers are screened with criminal background checks, and they must be licensed with the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.","The easy-to-spot decoration has been replaced with a 5in-long plastic replica which goes on the dashboard .

"Kurdish forces have managed to oust Isis terrorists from their Kobane stronghold on the Syrian - Turkish border after months of intense fighting. It is believed that 1,800 people have died in the battle which lasted more than four months. Foreign media were able to film some of the clashes from the relative safety of the Turkish side of the border. Scroll down for video . Kurdish defence troops raised their flag over the town of Kobane, replacing the black flag of Isis . The four-month battle for Kobane has claimed at least 1,800 lives after Isis tried to seize the strategic town . Ordinary people took to the streets to celebrate the Isis defeat which is a major setback for the terror group . Isis tried a major frontal assault on the Kurdish town of Kobane, prompting much of the civilian population to flee over the Turkish border. However, strong pockets of opposition managed to hold out against the Isis assault and eventually managed to go on the offensive. U.S. aircraft and drones targeted Isis positions around the town, preventing any major counter attacks. Yesterday, Kurdish troops raised their flags above the town of Kobane after claiming to have driven out the final Isis resistance. It was also announced that Iraqi forces had managed to liberate the town of Diyala from Isis control. U.S. and coalition aircraft launched 17 airstrikes against Isis position in 24 hours ousting the terrorists . Kurdish fighters have secured 90 per cent of Kobane, with small numbers of Isis reported in the east of town . However, thousands of Kurdish civilians celebrated in the centre of the city after the major Isis defeat . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) had 'expelled all Islamic State fighters from Kobane and have full control of the town'. Rami Abdel Rahman of the Observatory said: 'The Kurds are pursuing some jihadists on the eastern outskirts of Kobane, but there is no more fighting inside now.' US Central Command said Kurdish forces now had control of 90 percent of Kobane. 'While the fight against ISIL (Isis) is far from over, ISIL's failure in Kobane has denied them one of their strategic objectives,' Central Command said in a statement. Kurdish forces were carrying out 'mopping-up operations' against remaining IS forces in the Maqtala district, on the town's eastern outskirts. Kurdish people have started returning to Kobane, now that the security situation has improved . YPG spokesman Polat Jan also announced the news on Twitter, writing: 'Congratulations to humanity, Kurdistan, and the people of Kobane on the liberation of Kobane.' Mustafa Ebdi, an activist from the town, said the 'fighting has stopped'. Kurdish forces are advancing slowly through the eastern sections of Kobane because of the threat posed by improvised explosive devices, snipers and other types of booby trap. The rout of Isis forces followed 17 airstrikes targeting Isis positions over a period of 24 hours. The Pentagon confirmed that Coalition aircraft attacked 'tactical units', 'fighting positions', an Isis controlled vehicle as well as staging areas. Sources claim that Isis has lost almost 1,200 men in its failed attempt to capture Kobane. During the early stages of the battle, it seemed inevitable that the terror group was going to over-run the strategic city after they captured large amounts of advanced weaponry from Syrian and Iraqi troops. But Kurdish forces, supported by air raids led by the United States, halted the Isis onslaught. The Kobane defeat is a significant blow for Isis who had made significant territorial advances since 2013. Analyst Mutlu Civiroglu said: 'Despite all that manpower, all that sophisticated weaponry, Isis couldn't get the city, so it's a big blow for their plans and its a great achievement for the Kurds, . 'Kobane sets an example on the ground, showing that when you have skilled fighters on the ground with the support of air strikes, this danger, these forces, can be stopped and eliminated.' Civilians were largely spared in the fighting because they evacuated en masse, mostly across the border into Turkey, in the early stages of the battle. Over the border in Iraq, the army announced another defeat for IS, with the recapture of Diyala province. Many Kobane residents missed the worst of the fighting by crossing the Turkish border to safety . The Kurdish YPG produced banners praising some of their fighters who died in the defence of the town . Isis began its major assault on Kobane in September after destroying 300 nearby Kurdish villages . Staff Lieutenant General Abdulamir al-Zaidi said: 'We announce the liberation of Diyala from the Isis organisation. 'Iraqi forces are in complete control of all the cities and districts and subdistricts of Diyala province.' The general said there would still be clashes however against IS in the rural Hamreen mountains, which stretch across multiple provinces, including Diyala. Among international forces training the Iraqi military, Canadian special forces have twice exchanged gunfire with Isisfighters since the first confirmed ground battle in Iraq between Western troops and the jihadists earlier this month, a senior officer in Ottawa said. Captain Paul Forget said: 'Two similar events have occurred over the last week and, in both cases, Canadian special operations forces, again acting in self-defence, effectively returned fire, neutralising the threat.' No Canadians were injured. Isis has been pushed out of Kobane with small numbers of terrorists holding on in Maqtala . Kurdish troops were able to withstand the Isis onslaught after U.S. led airstrikes halted their advance . YPG units erected their flag on a strategic hill overlooking Kobane which had been vacated by Isis . Capturing Kobani would have given Isis control of a border crossing with Turkey and open direct lines for their positions along the frontier. Now, it is a grave psychological loss for the extremist group, which has been dealt a series of military setbacks in both Syria and Iraq, particularly at the hands of the Kurds. Last month, Kurdish fighters in Iraq retook the strategic town of Sinjar that had been home to many of Iraq's minority Yazidis. The focus is now expected to shift to several hundred villages around Kobani still held by the militants. Kurdish activists said they expected the fight for those to be easier than for the town itself. In September, Isis fighters began capturing about 300 Kurdish villages near Kobani and thrust into the town itself, occupying nearly half of it and sending tens of thousands of residents fleeing into Turkey. But the once-nondescript town with few resources quickly became a centerpiece of the international campaign against Isis. Thousands of Kurdish civilians sought refuge in camps on the Turkish side of the border after Isis  massacred civilians as the terror group moved through some 300 villages outside Kobane . TV crews flocked to the Turkish side of the border and trained their cameras on the besieged town, plumes of smoke rising from explosions. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declared it would be 'morally very difficult' not to help Kobani. The U.S.-led air assault began September 23, with Kobani the target of about a half-dozen daily airstrikes on average. More than 80 percent of all coalition airstrikes in Syria have been in or around the town. The United States has air-dropped supplies to Kurdish forces on the ground while wiping out dozens of Isis positions . By early January, more than 1,000 Islamic State fighters had been killed and much of its heavy weaponry destroyed. The group continued to invest in resources, bringing in hundreds of reinforcements. Activists said these included many teenagers and even children, signaling a shortage in its forces. The group made a last stand in the past few weeks, unleashing more than 35 suicide attacks in recent weeks, activists said. But the advancing Kurdish fighters could not be stopped. Isis troops are believed to have fled the area, leaving behind heavy weapons and fresh food, after 'their morale collapsed', according to local media reports.","Kurdish troops now control more than 90 per cent of Kobane after .

"The sinking of a cardboard Malaysia Airlines plane in a New Zealand competition has 'disgusted' the sister of a Kiwi man who was a passenger on the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 when it disappeared in March last year while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, China. Paul Weeks was travelling on the Boeing 777 plane, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, that crashed into the Indian Ocean. It has still not been found. Stuff.co.nz reported that Weeks' sister Sara felt it was bad enough that someone used the idea for the annual Tata Beach Titanic Cup for 'humour', but even worse that the competition judges awarded it the best sinking prize. A cardboard Malaysia Airlines plane starts to sink into Golden Bay during the annual Tata Beach Titanic Cup . Paul Weeks was one of the 239 people reported missing after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 last March . The premise of the Titanic Cup, which took place at Golden Bay at the northwest end of New Zealand's South Island, is to win the cardboard boat race. But there was also a prize for the most dramatic sinking, which the cardboard Malaysia Airlines plane won. 'I'm gobsmacked,' Ms Weeks from Christchurch said. 'It hasn't even been a year. What if it was his family member on the plane? He [the entrant] wouldn't find it funny.' Event organiser Dave Myall admitted the boat depicting the sinking MH370 was controversial but 'artistic merit was the overriding consideration'. The cardboard Malaysia Airlines entry was the best sinking competition winner . He stood by the three judges' decision. Such entries were par for an event with 'Titanic' in its title. 'At what point does a tragedy become safe to refer to? One of the ways to deal with it is humour,' he told Stuff.co.nz. 'I'm sorry to hear about the woman (Sara Weeks) and her misfortune, but this was a very local event. It needs to be taken in context. If the media outside of Nelson hadn't got involved, there would be no complaint.' Event organiser Dave Myall admitted the boat depicting the sinking MH370 was on the risque side . The best sinking competition winner received a scenic flight voucher – 'which in itself is ironic', Myall said. Robert Chubb, of Golden Bay, was the man behind creating the cardboard Malaysia Airlines plane. he said that he believed enough time had passed since the MH370 tragedy for people to see the humour instead of taking offence. The memory of Mr Weeks (pictured) had been disrespected by the crude display his sister Sara said . Ms Weeks called the entry 'tasteless and offensive'. 'I'm just appalled. I don't think I'll ever find that funny,' she said. 'To make it first prize, I'm quite surprised.'","Sister of Kiwi man on fatal flight is 'disgusted' by sinking of cardboard Malaysia Airlines plane in Golden Bay competition .

"Donkey milk and horse oil are having a renaissance as South Korea's hottest new skincare ingredients - and they are already making their way to into US products. The beauty savvy country, which introduced American women to BB and CC creams and ten-step skincare routines, is on its way to making the unlikely animal-based ingredients the next big thing. Alicia Yoon, a Harvard Business School graduate and co-founder of Korean beauty site Peach and Lily, told New York Magazine that she sees donkey milk and horse oil as the newest trends in Korean skincare. Scroll down for video . Natural wonders: Napoleon Perdis Auto Pilot Hydrating Cleanser features donkey milk, while Elizavecca Milky Piggy Origin Ma Cream is made from horse oil. The animal-based ingredients are the newest trends in Korean skincare . Beauty expert: Alicia Yoon (pictured), co-founder of Korean beauty site Peach and Lily, said horse oil is 'renowned for its absorbent properties' and donkey milk is 'rich in proteins' Ms Yoon explained that donkey milk 'is known to be gentle and soothing for those with sensitive skin and eczema, and [has] four to five times more vitamin C than cow’s milk and [is] rich in proteins'. She also said that horse oil is 'featured front and center' at some of the flagship locations of Olive Young, a popular beauty supply store in Seoul. 'Chinese tourists have come to love this product,' she said. 'Horse oil is known to sterilize and also renowned for its absorbent properties.' When asked how Korean skincare differs from American skincare, Ms Yoon said Korean products often contain more 'niche and adventurous' ingredients because Korean women tend to be more willing to experiment. 'I find that the major beauty brands are careful about launching anything too zany because, perhaps historically, American women would rather stick to more known ingredients like retinol and vitamin C,' she explained. Ancient tricks: Australian make-up artist Napolean Perdis (pictured) said his eponymous line's donkey milk cleanser was inspired by Cleopatra's beauty regimen . Historical beauty: Elizabeth Taylor (pictured) portrayed Cleopatra bathing in the 1963 film.  Cleopatra was said to have taken daily baths in the milk of more than 700 lactating donkeys . But donkey milk and horse oil aren't the only bizarre beauty ingredients to come out of South Korea. The country helped turn snail slime into a must-have skincare product. In 2010, Korean brand Missha launched Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cream, which contains 70per cent snail extract. The mollusk mucus is said to clear acne, heal scars and beat wrinkles, and it has been reported that Katie Holmes uses a cream containing the slime. Korean face masks containing pig collagen have also gained popularity. Holika Holika's Pig Collagen Jelly Pack is certificated by the Korea Food and Drug Administration and created using 70,000ml of collagen extracted from pig skin, which promises to erase wrinkles and give tired-looking skin a youthful glow. These products may seem strange, but Ms Yoon pointed out that Korean skincare 'tends to include more natural ingredients and formulations because of the rich history of using ingredients found in nature'. For example, donkey milk and horse oil have been touted for their cosmetic uses throughout history. Innovative ingredients: South Korea also helped turn snail slime into a must-have skincare product. Korean brand Missha launched Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cream (pictured) in 2010 . Animal skin: Pig collagen is another strange beauty ingredient to come out of South Korea. Holika Holika's Pig Collagen Jelly Pack (pictured)  is face mask certificated by the Korea Food and Drug Administration . Cleopatra was said to have taken daily baths in the milk of more than 700 lactating asses. While American beauty connoisseurs have to search Amazon and eBay for foreign skincare products containing horse oil, a donkey milk cleaner is already available in major US department stores, including Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom. Napoleon Perdis Auto Pilot Hydrating Milk Cleanser features lactation-by-donkey and retails for $69. Australian make-up artist Napoleon Perdis told Refinery 29 last August that the facial product from his eponymous line was inspired by an ancient beauty regimen. 'After learning Egyptian queen Cleopatra had reportedly bathed in donkey milk for its youth-enhancing effects, my team and I did some research into the benefits,' he said.

"Andrew Oldham, 48, from Blackpool . Andrew Oldham took one look at his mother, Barbara, asleep in the chair and felt tears catching in his throat. Her head was lolling on to her chest, her eyes were glazed and she was drooling slightly. When Andrew called her name she barely responded. 'It was as if all her personality had gone - it didn't feel like this was my mum any more,' says Andrew. What was so upsetting for him was that Barbara, then 83, had until the previous three months always been so outgoing and chatty. But she had suddenly, inexplicably gone downhill. Barbara, who formerly worked in a department store, had lived in the care home since 2002. 'She was not incapacitated nor did she have dementia,' says Andrew, 48, a theatre promoter from Blackpool. 'She had such a zest for life, always cracking jokes.' Yet the woman sitting in front of him on his visit to the Carders Court Care home in Castleton, Rochdale, on Christmas Day 2011 was very different. Staff claimed it was just that she had not slept well. 'I said that's not poor sleep - that's someone who's drugged,' says Andrew. He was right. An inquiry by Rochdale Council in 2013 found the Bupa-run care home had been giving his mother the sedative Promazine 'almost nightly'. They had requested her GP prescribe it five months earlier on account of her 'inappropriate behaviour', claiming she was agitated and disrupting residents. Yet no one else - not Andrew nor even the GP who prescribed the drug - had seen such behaviour. How drugs can raise stroke risk . Promazine is an antipsychotic drug commonly prescribed to the elderly for 'moderate to severe agitation'. Potential side-effects include drowsiness, confusion, slow or irregular heart rate, deep vein thrombosis, eye problems and a drop in blood pressure that can cause dizziness. What is shocking is that two months before, Andrew had discovered his mother was being given the drug inappropriately and had already kicked up a fuss. The changes in her behaviour had slowly crept on since the summer. His mother Barbara, pictured, had been given Promazine almost every night . 'I'd visit once a week or more and would normally find Mum bustling about, helping staff clear up or chatting to others,' he says. 'Yet she started seeming strangely subdued and tired,' he says. 'By October 2011 she was getting worse. We couldn't laugh and joke as before - her speech was often slurred and sometimes she barely opened her eyes.' 'I spoke to her GP, who listed all the medications Mum was on and mentioned Promazine. 'I said 'hang on, what's that for?' and the GP said it was because of her 'inappropriate behaviour'. I asked if she'd seen my mother like this? She admitted she hadn't. Yet this GP had prescribed this drug at the request of the care home staff.' The GP agreed to halve the dose. But the Rochdale Council inquiry - launched after a complaint by Andrew - found the care home staff continued to give it to his mother almost every night, not merely as needed as the GP had prescribed it, and for one week she had the full dose. The inquiry found that what the staff had done was tantamount to 'physical abuse'. Andrew, with the help of Patient Claim Line solicitors, took legal action against the care home and eventually received an apology and a £5,000 payout from Bupa last year. Days after that Christmas in 2011, Andrew moved his mother to a different care home. He says it took six months to clear the drug out of her system. 'A week after she arrived she was still very drowsy and fell on her face. Then three weeks later she fell again and broke her ankle. She had osteoporosis, so could never stand or walk again - all because, I think, of that Promazine.' Tellingly, the new home never reported any 'inappropriate behaviour', nor did she need any sedatives right up until she died in March 2014, aged 85. A Bupa statement says: 'This incident happened two years ago. Since then the care home has taken action to prevent this happening.' The Oldham family's experience is hardly unique. In a shocking study published in the Nursing Times last year, pharmacists went into 463 care homes nationwide to audit the antipsychotic medication given to elderly patients. They found a quarter receiving it did not have symptoms to warrant its use. Andrew took legal action against the care home and eventually received an apology and a £5,000 payout . Doctors told to cut prescriptions . The use of chemical coshes to subdue the elderly to make them easier to handle by care home and other staff was meant to have been stamped out after a 2009 edict from the Department of Health for doctors to reduce prescription of antipsychotics such as Promazine by two-thirds. This was the result of a 2009 study of 180,000 people with dementia who were on the drugs, which found the medication was inappropriate for 140,000 of them. It also found that about 1,800 frail dementia patients died each year as a result of these drugs. Antipsychotics were originally developed for treating schizophrenia to reduce delusions, but they also have a sedative effect. However, they increase the risk of blood clots and stroke. And a 2008 study in Sweden found putting elderly people on antipsychotics made them twice as likely to have a fall, possibly due to the drugs' effect on alertness. For an elderly person, falls can be fatal - as highlighted by the case of Peter Ryley, 76. The grandfather, from Long Eaton, Derbyshire, died after falling and injuring his head when an excessive amount of sedatives left him 'practically delirious' after his admission to Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham. The hospital later apologised. In the aftermath of the 2009 report, an audit found the prescriptions for antipsychotics dropped by 52 per cent, but there has been no audit since. However, a 2013 study by Queens University Belfast found that about 20 per cent of elderly people in care homes are still given anti-psychotic drugs compared with 1 per cent of people the same age still living in the community. About 20 per cent of elderly people in care homes are still given anti-psychotic drugs (posed by model) Why the pills are sometimes justified . Liberal Democrat MP Paul Burstow, a former health minister who announced the drive to push down the use of antipsychotics, says the results of another audit were due to be published last autumn. 'Quite why that has not happened we don't know,' he says. The Health and Social Care Information Centre says there has been a delay in publishing the new audit because of changes in how the data is collected. Mr Burstow fears the move to reduce the use of these drugs has 'slipped down the agenda' for both GPs and care home staff. 'We were making good progress by training GPs and staff,' he says. 'But there is such a high turnover of staff in care homes that it's something we need to keep at, and we need repeat audits. 'There is little justification for the systematic use of these drugs that we know can shorten lives. There are other ways of managing behaviour than doping people.' The problem is that once people get put on these drugs, often they don't get taken off them, says Clive Bowman, visiting professor at City University and a former medical director of care homes and a NHS gerontologist. He says elderly people who go into hospital with a chest or urine infection can become delirious, seem confused and become disruptive, so may be put on sedatives. Delirium affects as many as a fifth of all hospital patients, but is most common among elderly patients. 'There are occasions when someone causes a disturbance and you have to make a hard decision,' he says. 'Do you allow the other 29 people on the ward to suffer or sedate the person making the disturbance?' But once the infection clears, the patient leaves hospital and the sedative drugs go with them. As Professor Bowman explains: 'They may then be discharged to a care home with a new GP, and the only information the GP will have is 'chest infection, became confused' and the medicines they are on, including sedatives. The GP will assume these medicines need to be continued.' Is the answer as easy as a cup of tea? Dementia patients are some of the most likely to be prescribed sedatives because they can become agitated and aggressive - but there is often a reason, explains Professor June Andrews, a former nurse who runs the Dementia Services Development Centre at the University of Stirling. 'They may become agitated when they need the loo or a drink, or because they've become fixated on the idea their daughter needs to be taken to school,' she says. One common trigger for agitation in dementia patients is untreated pain, according to recent reports - painkillers can help. In other cases, Professor Andrews says taking the person for a walk, playing music or even giving them a cup of tea may ease the agitation. GPs often assume staff will have done all they can to address agitation before asking for a prescription. The Alzheimer's Society agrees that these drugs are too readily handed out and wants better training on the alternatives for care home staff. Professor Andrews agrees: 'These drugs are wonderful used in the right dose with the right person, but with the frail and elderly they must be used really sparingly.' Andrew Oldham misses his mother deeply, but says: 'I'm pleased she spent the last part of her life happy being herself and not a drugged zombie.'

"A principal at a prestigious prep school in Rhode Island has unleashed his inner artist to perform a parody of Frozen's Let It Go which is now going viral. Matt Glendinning, 50, from Moses Brown School in Providence starred in the comical music video to announce that lessons are off due to heavy snowfall from winter storm Juno. For more than four minutes he enthusiastically sings about the icy weather, while wrapped up in a snazzy knitted hat, glove and scarf ensemble. Caught on camera: Matt Glendinning from Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island, has unleashed his inner artist to perform a parody of Frozen's Let It Go which is now going viral . 'The snow glows white on Route 95, not a tire track to be seen. We could make you come to school but that would just be mean,' he chimes to the camera. At one point he grabs a sleigh to do a spot of sledging in the playground and later he sits inside with a cup of cocoa. 'Today no Moses Brown for me, I'm free!' Glendinning continues. He also encourages students to either 'stay in bed and sleep' or 'read an engaging book'. Adam Olenn, the school’s director of public relations, was the man behind the quirky song. He told WBUR News that he sat down and wrote the lyrics in 15 minutes. As a father of two young girls he was familiar with the hit Frozen song. Although Glendinning looks like he’s singing in the video, the voice viewers are actually hearing is the school’s choral director, Justin Peters.

"A sinkhole gobbled up one family's car in Maryland on Tuesday morning. Darwin Mendoza says he was in the car with his 8-year-old son, and two daughters, a 4-year-old and a 6-month-old baby, when it hit the hole as he was backing out of his driveway. The hole was hidden by water. Mendoza says at first, only one tire sank, and that he and his children got out of the car. They then watched as the sinkhole got bigger and swallowed the car whole. 'They were running to leave. Thank God they didn't put their seat belts on. It helped them get out of the car,' neighbor Luz Martinez told NBC Washington. Scroll down for videos .

"Hundreds of millions of people worldwide were unable to use Facebook and Instagram for around an hour today. Hackers from online group Lizard Squad have claimed they shut down the two sites at around 6am GMT - but Mark Zuckerberg's social media empire says it was just a technical fault. Both sites, which have a total of 1.5billion users, appeared with error messages  in the United States, Europe and Asia for around an hour. The social media blackout also affected the dating mobile app Tinder, as well as AOL Instant Messenger and Hipchat. Scroll down for video . Hacked? Facebook and its stable-mate Instagram were down for an hour this morning after an alleged cyber attack . Statement: Instagram, the photo sharing site owned by Facebook, was also offline although they say it was caused by a technical fault . Facebook, which also owns Instagram, has denied they were hacked and blamed the outage on 'a change that affected our configuration systems'. There were claims online that the super-snowstorm that is over America's east coast may have knocked out its servers. While it was down Facebook said they were 'aware' of trouble accessing the site and added: 'We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible.' A spokesman later added: 'Earlier today many people had trouble accessing Facebook and Instagram. This was not the result of a third party attack but instead occurred after we introduced a change that affected our configuration systems. Lizard Squad's Facebook page after claiming it hacked Sony Playstation and Xbox . The Lizard Squad took credit for bringing down the Microsoft's Xbox, and Sony's PlayStation online networks, hitting users on Christmas Day. The hacking group said it wanted to expose the two firms' poor security. The consoles rely on an internet connection for many functions. One of the most popular features of the consoles, for example, is the ability to play against friends and other users. While an internet connection is not required to play all games, new Xbox One consoles need to be online to be successfully set-up. Many of those who received the consoles as Christmas presents are thought to have experienced problems getting started. Furthermore, games on both consoles often require an internet connection to be installed fully, which was ruled out by the hack. A message on the Xbox status page at the weekend said its core services were 'up and running'. Sony engineers then confirmed its core services were also back online, but heavy traffic might continue to cause problems, as thousands of users log back on. 'We moved quickly to fix the problem, and both services are back to 100 per cent for everyone.' An Instagram spokesman posted on Twitter: 'We're aware of an outage affecting Instagram and are working on a fix. Thank you for your patience.' There is no word at this time what is causing the outage, and whether or not it might have anything to do with the ongoing blizzard, which is expected to dump 36 inches of snow in parts of New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Connecticut, where key servers are based. The headquarters of Facebook are located in Menlo Park, California - an area which has not been affected by the storm. The hashtag #facebookdown and #socialmeltdown2015 immediately started tending on Twitter, which remains operational. Facebook had 1.25 billion monthly active users at the end of September last year, while photo-sharing service Instagram has 300 million active monthly users uploading around 70 million photos per day. Andrew Pope, an engineer at Facebook, posted on to the Facebook Developer's website to alert app creators to the 'major outage' which he said lasted up to an hour between around 6.10am and 7.10am. 'Our engineers identified the cause of the outage and recovered the site quickly,' he wrote. 'Thank you for your patience. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you and the users of your apps.' The Lizard Squad is a group of hackers that has caused havoc in the online world before, taking credit for attacks that took down the Sony PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live network last month. This morning the group tweeted 'Facebook, Instagram, Tinder, AIM, Hipchat £offline £LizardSquad'. Previously it claimed responsibility for the Christmas Day attack on Xbox and PlayStation games consoles which saw online services disabled. In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, one of the group's hackers, who called himself 'member one', said he enjoyed identifying weaknesses in the web security of global companies. 'I wouldn't call myself a top-grade hacker - I know people who are way better than me. It's fair to say I know my stuff though,' he said. 'With me, when people, friends of mine, go out clubbing, partying, I didn't enjoy it so I decided to sit at home and learn more skills of my own. 'Maybe this isn't something most people enjoy and think it was a good decision but for us it was something that we just decided upon.' He added that 'huge, global companies' with teams of technicians should be able to protect their network security from hackers who have 'barely lived'. Previous: Yesterday the Lizard Squad claimed they had brought down the Malaysia Airlines website . Blank: Millions who tried to log on to Facebook and Instagram saw these blank screens this morning . The latest outage sparked panic online, but the majority retained a sense of humour . Another user Gino Quillamor wrote: 'Now that facebook is down, I might actually have to ask people how they're feeling in real life. 'What's on your mind?'' Rob Lee joked: 'If Facebook & Instagram are down how am I supposed to know what my aunt had for dinner or if any of my friends held a Starbucks cup today???' On a more serious note, less than 30 minutes into the shutdown, a hacker group known as the Lizard Squad claimed responsibility for the outage. In August, it also tweeted to American Airlines that there might be explosives on a plane carrying the president of Sony Online Entertainment, which makes video games, forcing the flight to be diverted. Yesterday, it claimed to have targeted The Malaysia Airlines website, leaving a message saying '404 Plane Not Found' and declaring it part of their 'cyber caliphate' Users logging on to the site of Malaysia's national carrier were greeted with the picture of a lizard in a top hat, monocle and tuxedo, smoking a pipe. The image was surrounded by the message '404 Plane Not Found', an apparent reference to the airlines' unexplained loss of flight MH370 last year with 239 people aboard. The extent of any links with the Islamic State, however, are not yet known. The jihadist group has seized large swathes of Syria and Iraq in a brutal campaign and declared an independent Islamic 'caliphate'. It also has used social media to recruit and spread its message. Lizard Squad is a network of hackers which bears striking similarities to the online anarchist collective Anonymous and is described as 'vocal, taunting and bit obnoxious'. The group seeks to cause mayhem online 'for a laugh' and has called itself the 'next generation Grinch' after the children's character that hates Christmas, often using Twitter to boast of upcoming attacks. Some reports say it mainly operates from Russia but others believe it is more likely to be made up of underground networks of hackers from around the world, communicating using the 'dark web'. Lizard Squad has a history of targeting computer game companies, particularly Sony. In August it sent a bomb threat to Sony chief executive John Smedley, the same month in which it attacked Playstation just to cause 'havoc'. Dan Holden, of online security company Arbor Networks, said: 'If they're coming after you, you're going to have a bad day.'","Millions locked out of Facebook and Instagram for around an hour .

"U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was released by the Taliban last year in exchange for five prisoners is to be charged with desertion . An American Army sergeant that was released by the Taliban last year in exchange for five of its fighters in U.S. custody is will be charged with desertion, several reports indicate. Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl's lawyer has been handed a charge sheet listing out the articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice he has violated, retired Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer revealed. Bergdahl's attorney, Eugene R. Fidell, told Daily Mail Online today that he had not been issued a charge sheet on behalf of his client, however. He declined to comment further on the matter. NBC News said Tuesday it had confirmed the charges but stressed that the Army had yet to formally accuse Bergdahl. A former platoon mate of Bergdahl's who spoke to Daily Mail Online, Sgt. Jordan Vaughn, said neither he nor any of the other soldiers that served alongside the former prisoner of war had received any new information regarding the situation, but he considers Shaffer a reliable source of information. Vaughn told Daily Mail Online he'd spoken to other members of the platoon recently, and they are in agreement that the military should take legal action against Bergdahl. 'We all think absolutely that he should be court-martialed and that he was intending to desert,' Vaughn said. Scroll down for video . A former platoon mate of Bergdahl's who spoke to Daily Mail Online, Sgt. Jordan Vaughn, said he'd spoken to other soldiers who served alongside the prisoner of war, and they are in agreement that the military should take legal action against Bergdahl . Retired Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer said Sgt. Bergdahl's attorney had been handed a charge sheet detailing the articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that have been violated . Referencing previous testimony, Vaughn affirmed that he and other soldiers heard local radio chatter just after Bergdahl disappeared about an American wandering around without his weapon 'trying to make contact with the Taliban.' 'It's very clear to all of us that it was desertion, and obviously that's court-martiable,' Vaughn said. Bergdahl was held captured and taken captive by the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network in Afghanistan from June 2009 until May 2014 before being swapped by the Barack Obama administration for Taliban fighters imprisoned at a U.S. facility in Guantanamo Bay. Shaffer, a former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency official assigned to Afghanistan, now works for the London Center for Policy Research. He was made famous in 2010 after the Department of Defense bought and burned all 9,500 copies of his memoir Operation Dark Heart because it allegedly contained classified information. The retired Army Lt. Colonel told Fox News Monday evening that a number of sources had confirmed the outcome of Bergdahl's military review to him. Speaking on The O'Reilly Factor, he said: 'His attorney was given what we call a charge sheet. A charge sheet is results of the investigation listing out the articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that have been violated. The key violation is desertion. And this has been done. The decision has been made. Let me be very clear. As a corporate entity, the Army has decided that they want to pursue Bergdahl for this violation.' NBC News says the Army may issue charges within the next week. According to the news agency, the sheet will not allege that Bergdahl left the military base with no intention of returning, however. And while Bergdahl may be remanded to prison, NBC News suggested the military may consider his the time he spent as a hostage punishment enough. He could be let off with a 'less than honorable discharge.' An Army spokesman flatly denied on Tuesday that Bergdahl had been charged with desertion. Major General Ronald Lewis, head of public affairs for the U.S. Army, said in a statement that media reports published Tuesday about the case are 'patently false.' If that changes, formal charges could mean Bergdahl would not receive roughly $300,000 in back pay he is currently owed – and he would be demoted back to his previous rank, Private First Class. After the Obama administration's much criticized exchange, the Army launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's departure from his post. The military concluded its review several months ago but has not yet released a report of its findings. After the Taliban released Sgt. Bergdahl, he spent two weeks recuperating at a U.S. military hospital in Germany before he was  transferred to Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston on June 13. He has since been assigned to an administrative post on the sprawling Fort Sam Houston Army post in San Antonio, Texas, as he awaits the conclusion of his case. Sources close to the probe say the former Taliban prisoner is free to carry on with his military duties and has not been placed in custody or under any special restrictions. The vast military complex houses more than 900 buildings including the San Antonio Military Medical Center and the command headquarters for the United States Army North and United States Army South. Sgt Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban after he fled from his unit in Afghanistan without permission . Shaffer accused the Obama administration on Monday of trying to keep the results of the investigation into Sgt. Bergdahl's disappearance a secret. 'This is shaping up to be a titanic struggle behind the scenes,' he said. 'Believe me, the Army here wants to do the right thing … And the White House, because of the political narrative, President Obama cozying up to the parents and because he, President Obama, releasing the five Taliban … The narrative is what the White House does not want to have come out.' Last year it was revealed that the U.S. army had prosecuted about 1,900 cases of desertion since 2001. The figure was considered relatively low considering tens of thousands of soldiers had fled the service in the face of deadly combat, long and multiple deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan and strains on military families. More than 20,000 soldiers have been dropped from the rolls as deserters since 2006, according to Army data released last year. In trial cases over the last 13 years, roughly half of the soldiers who were charged pleaded guilty to deserting their posts. Another 78 were tried and convicted.","Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl fled without permission in Afghanistan in 2009; he was then captured by the Taliban and held him captive for five years .

One month after we were married he went out drinking with some friends. He tried some cocaine.. .and that was it. He became a severe alcoholic and drug addict. He drained our accounts, stole every penny, destroyed our house, violently threatened me, and finally disappeared. Then he overdosed and spent months in rehab only to continue his habit the minute he got out. This sounds like a white trash love story right? He was actually from a wealthy, upper class family, was endlessly kind and loyal to us, very well educated. It was a complete shock to all of us with this behavior. He is still a junkie to this day. We were only married eight months from 'I do' to divorce day in court. It still breaks my heart to this day. Spiritual prompting . My sister had a friend that got divorced really quickly after her marriage (six months I think). The whole thing was rushed. They dated for less than a year. She married him because she was religious and thought she was receiving a spiritual prompting. After the marriage they didn't act like newlyweds at all. Little to no holding hands, when they were sitting on a couch they had a foot of space between themselves, etc. It wasn't long before they realized it wasn't going to work out. In one case a woman admitted that her husband had used the internet to find men for sex . Hidden addictions . A friend of mine from university got divorced after three months because of her husband's addictions that he failed to mention - cocaine and finding gay men for sex on Craigslist. I say that the second was an addiction because he was picking up like three dudes a week on average. Counselling turned to coupling . My mother got divorced six months after her first marriage. They were having problems, went to a marriage counsellor who told my mom that her husband needed one-on-one counselling but that my mom was fine and could go home. After their divorce finalised, another wedding with the marriage counsellor was in the works. The fling attended the wedding . My future ex-sister-in-law invited her boyfriend to her wedding to my brother. We didn't realise who he was at the time. Forced into it . My parents threatened me and my ex saying we were living 'in sin' because we were living together and not married. I was married at 18 and divorced at 19 because he wouldn't stop beating the s**t out of me. Thanks mom and dad! Had we just been DATING I would have just moved my s**t out of the apartment and been done, but instead I had to go through hell to get a divorce. Poor laundry skills . We got divorced seven months after our wedding. We had rough times but who doesn't? He was a cheater and very good at talking his way out of trouble. We had an argument about him not trying in our relationship while I was at work. I came home later that night and then told me we needed a divorce because I don't know how to put away the laundry. He also said he fell out of love with me and we were never meant to be. A few months later comes to find out he left me for someone else. Better off without him. Living a lie . Neither of us realised he wanted to become a woman until six months into the marriage when he hit me out of frustration with his own body.","Reddit asked users to explain why they divorced before a year of marriage .

"He was notorious for terrorising shipping in the west Atlantic, but treasures discovered among the wreckage of Blackbeard's ship suggest the feared pirate may have had a caring side. Marine archaeologists have found evidence of medical equipment used to heal the sick and wounded on board the pirate captain's flagship, the Queen Anne's Revenge. The artifacts are the latest clues of what life would have been like on the ship that became feared along the east coast of America and the West Indies. A pewter syringe (above) was found to contained mercury, which was used to treat diseases like syphilis . The wreckage of the Queen Anne's Revenge was discovered in 1996 on a sandbar in Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, where Blackbeard, also known as Edward Teach, ran it aground in 1718. Since then archaeologists working on the Queen Anne's Revenge project have recovered cannons, glass beads, coins, pottery and gold dust from the remains of the vessel that have provided a glimpse of the pirates' lifestyle. Experts have found an array of fascinating artifacts from Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge wreckage since 1996. Archaeologists have recovered onion bottles, two bells of Spanish or Portuguese origin a coin weight with Queen Anne's likeness stamped on it, buckles, glass beads, buttons, cuff links, pieces of wine glasses, a syringe, gold flakes, among others. The same team are said to have also found 11 cannons from the pirate ship, including one in 2005 and another in 2007. Another rare find was a partly gilded hilt thought to have held the sword of Blackbeard himself. But among the wreckage they have also found a number of items that would have been used for medical care, including a syringe, a blood porringer, an apothecary's weight set, along with a mortar and pestle. Archaeologists who have been studying the artifacts say that they suggest Blackbeard made great efforts to keep his crew healthy. It is a image that contrasts greatly with the pirate captain's ruthless and ferocious reputation. The English pirate had a fearsome appearance, tying his thick black beard into pigtails, stringing weapons from slings around his shoulders and sticking lighted matches under his hat when he went into battle. He also had a reputation for marooning members of his crew and enforcing strict discipline on board his ships. Linda Carnes-McNaughton, an archaeologist with the Department of the Army at the Directorate of Public Works in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, said: 'Treating the sick and injured of a sea-bound community on shipboard was challenging in the best of times. 'Chronic and periodic illnesses, wounds, amputations, toothaches, burns and other indescribable maladies of the crew, captain, and enslaved cargo had to be treated.' She added that maintaining his crew's health was so important to Blackbeard that when he turned the captured French slaver ship La Concorde into the Queen Anne's Revenge, he released most of the original crew but forced the three ship's surgeons to stay. The wreck of the Queen Anne's Revenge was discovered where it had run aground  in Beafort Inlet (above) A mortar and pestle (above) was thought to have been used to prepare medical treatments for the crew . Blackbeard, played by Ian McShane in the Pirates of the Caribbean films (above), had a fearsome reputation . Among the medical equipment discovered on board were a pewter urethral syringe that has been found to contain traces of mercury. It is believed this was used to treat the sexually transmitted disease syphilis, although the mercury itself would have eventually poisoned the patient. Divers have also recovered a set of apothecary weights that were thought to have been used to weigh out medicines while a mortar and pestle was used to crush treatments. They have also discovered the remains of two pump clysters, which would have been used to perform enemas, which would have allowed medication to be quickly absorbed. An 11ft anchor, weighing nearly 3,000lb, was recovered from the wreck of the Queen Anne's Revenge in 2011 . The graphic above shows what the Queen Anne's Revenge would have looked like at the time of Blackbeard . They have yet to analyse the clysters to discover what they had contained. A blood porringer - used to measure out blood during bloodletting that was thought to cure some conditions - was also found. The remains of glass bottles and pots that may have contained drugs and balms were also discovered. Dr Carnes-McNaughton, who presented her findings to the Society for Historical Archaeology, also said that other items have been found that could have had medical uses. A silver needle and the remains of scissors could have been used to help repair injured sailors after battle while a brass set of screws could have been used in a tourniquet during amputations. Dr Carens-McNaughton has used records from the original crew list of La Concorde to discover the names of some of the surgeons that served on the Queen Anne's Revenge. The remains of square glass bottles were found on the wreck that may have contained drugs or medical gin . Blackbeard used his appearance to strike fear into his enemies but the new finds suggest he had a softer side . These included the La Concorde surgeon major Jean Dubou, from St Etienne, Marc Bourgneuf, from La Rochelle and Claude Deshayes, who was also a gunsmith. She claims that there is also evidence from records at the time that Blackbeard would trade hostages for medical supplies. in 1718, for example, he blockaded the port of Charleston, South Carolina, capturing the ships that tried to enter. While parleying with the governor of South Carolina, Blackbeard demanded a chest of medicine or he would murder all their prisoners. The governor complied an the prisoners were released. Dr Carnes-McNaughton told the Mail Online: 'To our knowledge, he never killed anyone directly, but did issue harsh punishment to some and wounded one of his crew on purpose. 'But the fact that he retained, or kidnapped, if you prefer, the French surgeons leads us to think he had no other medical professionals on board at the time he stole the La Concorde and his men were suffering the ills of syphilis and scurvy and perhaps other wounds. 'They were no good to him as crew members if they were not able to sail the ship and maintain the business at hand - that of piracy. 'Medical equipment and supplies and surgeons, may have been equally as important to him as gold was.' However, in November 1718, Blackbeard was finally hunted down by the Royal Navy and he died in a final battle after apparently receiving more than 25 wounds. Among the other items to be recovered from the shipwreck of the Queen Anne's Revenge are five cannons that Blackbeard had installed on the vessel after he captured it. The cannons, one of which weighed more than 3,000lb, would have fired 6lb cannon balls at any ships daring to confront them. One of the five cannon used by Blackbeard is raised from the wreck of the Queen's Anne Revenge in 2013 . Grains of gold have also been found on the vessel (above) hinting at the riches enjoyed by Blackbeard's crew . Historians believe the largest cannon found was made in Sweden, meaning Blackbeard who was also known as Edward Teach or Thatch, had guns from different countries on board. In total, 40 cannons were believed to have been on board the Queen Anne's Revenge. Since the wreck was discovered in 1996, 22 of the ship's guns and about 280,000 artifacts have been recovered. Other finds have included onion bottles, bells, buckles and a partly gilded hilt thought to have held Blackbeard's sword.","Archaeologists discovered a syringe and enema pumps in the ship wreck .

"A high profile barrister has been arrested after his teenage boyfriend died of a suspected drugs overdose. Henry Hendron, 34, was questioned after waiter Miguel Jimenez was discovered at a flat in the Temple, London’s legal centre. He was released on bail while toxicology tests are carried out on the body to determine the cause of death. High profile barrister Henry Hendron, 34, left, was arrested after his boyfriend Miguel Jiminez, 18 was found dead at his flat in Temple, London. Mr Hendron was released on bail to return to a police station in March . Mr Hendron, whose clients have included Tory MP Nadine Dorries and Apprentice winner Stella English, was fined last year for an online attack on witnesses due to testify at the rape trial of his friend, former Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans. The barrister, who as a teenager addressed the Conservative party conference demanding the return of corporal punishment, was yesterday too upset to comment about Mr Jimenez’s death. But he posted a picture of his boyfriend on his Facebook page with the tribute: ‘it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all.’ His brother, Richard Hendron, said he was ‘completely devastated’. Mr Jimenez, who described himself on Facebook as originally from the city of Cali in Colombia, was a popular barista at the Kahaila café in Shoreditch, east London, where fellow staff described him as an ‘amazing person.’ Mr Hendron, pictured, is said to be 'completely devastated' over the sudden death of his partner . Mr Hendron, right, who is a friend of Nigel Evans MP, left, has been released on police bail after the death of his 18-year-old waiter boyfriend Miguel Jimenez who was found dead at his London apartment last week . A statement from his family described him as a ‘young man with a bright future ahead of him.’ ‘He was popular and was about to embark on an exciting career in marketing. ‘His has come as a complete shock to his friends and family and we are all devastated by his loss.’ A spokesman for City of London Police said: ‘Police were called at 08.58 on Tuesday 20 January to a residential address in the Temple following reports of a sudden death. ‘London Ambulance Service and City of London Police attended the scene. The man was pronounced dead at the scene. ‘A post mortem began at Poplar Mortuary on Thursday 22 January. The coroner awaits the results of toxicology tests. ‘The death is being treated as unexplained at this time. ‘A 34 year old man has been arrested in connection with the investigation. He has been bailed until a date in March.’ Mr Hendron, whose clients have included Tory MP Nadine Dorries, right, and Apprentice winner Stella English, left, has been released on bail while toxicology tests are carried out on the body . A former Crown Prosecution Service prosecutor, Mr Hendron now works at Strand Chambers in London and charges up to £1,750 a day to represent clients in civil cases. 'He is described on his website as 'impressive, determined and tenacious'. Law chiefs found him guilty of professional misconduct in November after he described alleged victims as 'manipulative and duplicitous’ on the eve of start date of the trial of Mr Evans. The Bar Standards Board fined him £2,000. Mr Evans, the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, was cleared in April of nine sexual offences against Parliamentary researchers, including raping a young man at his Lancashire home. As a 17-year-old schoolboy Mr Hendron was cheered as he addressed the 1998 Tory party conference calling for the reintroduction of corporal punishment. The following year he was hailed by a newspaper as a potential next leader of the Conservative party after he made a citizens arrest on a would-be bank thief.

"Doctors who scanned a toddler's chest to try and discover what he had swallowed were shocked to find an image of the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants staring back at them. Dr Ghofran Ageely, a radiology resident at the King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, said she screamed when reading the X-ray. The 16-month-old hospital patient had been brought in because he appeared to have swallowed an object. A 16-month-old toddler taken to hospital in Saudi Arabia, his parents fearing he had swallowed something, was found to have ingested a SpongeBob SquarePants pendant, owned by his sister . But medics were amazed to see the character, smiling and with his tongue sticking out, looking back at them from the image. Dr Ageely told Livescience the rogue SpongeBob turned out to be a pendant, owned by the toddler's older sister. She said the first X-ray captured an image of the child's side. From it, Dr Ageely could see there was something - a thin object - lodged in the boy's oesophagus. She suspected it was a pin or hair accessory. 'Then I opened the frontal view and was shocked, ""SpongeBob"", I screamed,' she said. 'I was amazed by the visible details, you can see his freckles, shoes and fingers.' The pendant was removed from the boy's throat and he was discharged to recover at home. The images were later shared on a forum where radiologists and medical students discuss cases, including foreign bodies. Dr Andrew Dixon, the managing editor of Radiopaedia, and a radiologist at The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, said: 'We see a lot of amazing X-rays on our site, but this one is particularly amazing.' He said the detail on the pendant was so clear because it was made up of tiny ridges in the metal's surface. Radiologists were shocked to see the cartoon character's face staring back at them, left.

"Beginning this summer, Frozen film enthusiasts will have the opportunity to embark on an entire cruise inspired by the animated blockbuster. Disney Cruise Lines have just announced that they will offer an immersive experience - including a deck party, three-song stage show and character meet and greets - on board select Disney Magic and Disney Wonder sailings. And no, these ships aren't just headed to the Caribbean - appropriately, the Frozen-themed journeys will take place on cruises to Europe and Alaska. Anna, Elsa and Olaf will be on board the Disney ships for the special Frozen-themed cruises . The selected ships will be transformed into a winter wonderland on par with the Kingdom of Arendelle. On one special morning, guests will wake up to discover that a magical freeze has overtaken the atrium lobby, with sparkling icicles adorning the grand staircase. Throughout the day, the chill will move to the upper decks of the ship, with giant snowflakes and snow-covered rocks. The family-friendly cruises will tour Alaska and Europe, whisking passengers to destinations not unlike Arendelle . That evening, families will be able to attend an interactive deck party, called 'Freezing the Night Away with Anna, Elsa and Friends,' featuring the famous royal sisters. A high-energy line dance, set to the movie's ice cutting scene, will also mean the arrival of Kristoff and Princess Anna. Sven, the trolls and Olaf will also make special, virtual appearances at the party. But, of course, a party isn't a party until Elsa arrives to serenade the guests with a performance of her hit song, 'Let It Snow.' And after the family fun wraps up, adults can head to the nightclub for specialty frozen drinks. Character meet-and-greets, special shows and a Frozen deck party will also happen on board . Aboard the Disney Magic ship, there will also be an at-sea stage show debuting, where Frozen favourites will perform renditions of three popular songs. For those heading to Norway aboard the Disney Magic, there will be the opportunity for guests to join exciting new Port Adventures that bring the fairytale setting to life. As Norway did serve as the inspiration for Frozen's Kingdom of Arendelle, an exclusive ashore adventure to the storybook village of Ålesund will help bring the story to life. Other shore excursions on this particular route will send guests off to discover natural wonders, stunning architecture and Scandinavian culture, on either seven or nine-night voyages.","Some Disney sailings to transform into winter wonderland, starting in June .

"Flexing its financial might, the political machine backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch on Monday told its allies that spending in the 2016 election cyle would hit $889 million across its conservative network. Three major news outlets – The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Associated Press – reported the 'leaked' figure almost simultaneously on Tuesday morning, along with the Virginia political newspaper Politico, suggesting the uber-wealthy brothers want that gargantuan number out there. The Kochs would put only a small amount of that money on the table themselves: They have patiently cultivated a hush-hush collection of about 450 moneyed conservatives who are expected to carry equal shares of the load. The brothers' Koch Industries produces everything from Dixie cups and toilet paper to jet fuel and fertilizer. They're personally tied for fourth place on Forbes magazine's list of the wealthiest Americans, with assets estimated at $41.5 billion each. But in the pantheon of individual political donors, the Kochs are nowhere near the top: They were tied for 24th place, at $2 million apiece, among donors to outside spending groups in the 2014 elections. Liberal climate-change hawk Tom Steyer outdistanced the field with more than $73 million. David Koch (left), shown on January 7 at a film gala with TV host Charlie Rose (right), is a major philanthropist, the principal driving force behind the brothers' political outreach and spending, and the organizing muscle behind Freedom Partners, which will put nearly $900 million in play during next year's election season . Charles Koch (shown in 2007) is at the head of Koch Industries and runs the company with an eye toward giving 100,000 a say in management and reinvesting 90 per cent of profits instead of pulling money out . Micing with liberals: David Koch (center) sat with Barbara Walters (left) and TIME political columnist Joe Klein (right) at the Time 100 gala in April 2014 . In conservative circles, though, they're without equal in their willingness to organize other wealthy donors to defend the ideal of a limited federal government. That's a value their father Fred instilled in them after he spent the earliest part of his career building oil refineries in the Soviet Union and became enraged by what he saw as the evils of communism. The net result is an $889 million political budget planned by Freedom Partners, the secretive chamber-of-commerce-type group that hosted four potential Republican presidential candidates at its weekend meetings in Palm Springs, California. That amount would dwarf expected spending from official GOP committees and many major presidential candidates. In the 2012 election, the last time Americans elected a president, the Republican National Committee and the party’s two campaign committees covering congressional races spent a combined total of $657 million. News of the hefty budget also suggests that the Koch-backed groups are prepared to spend heavily and early to weaken the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Koch-backed groups such as Americans for Prosperity aired tens of millions of dollars in negative ads against incumbent Democratic lawmakers in 2014 and helped Republicans win a majority in the Senate. While the Koch-backed groups are tremendously effective, even some of their allies eyed the latest budget figure with wariness. Former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, a Republican who now heads the American Bankers Association and who calls the Kochs 'wonderful human beings,' lamented the ballooning role of outside groups in politics during an Associated Press interview. 'This is the new normal,' Keating said. And fierce political enemies of Charles Koch, 79, and David Koch, 74, pounced. Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee told Politico sarcastically: 'Wait, you mean a bunch of billionaires are going to spend nearly $1 billion in pocket change to try to buy a president to rig the system for them and give them massive tax breaks that no one else gets? I'm shocked!' Ben Ray, a spokesman for the liberal American Bridge 21st Century, a PAC linked to the controversial group Media Matters for America, told the AP that the Kochs will 'stop at nothing to purchase a government that grows their profits, weakens pollution standards and maintains tax breaks for big oil.' But spending is not a guarantee of success. Veteran GOP operative John Feehery said the massive investment would have little impact if Republicans lack quality candidates. 'None of the spending will make a difference unless we have a credible candidate who can effectively lead the country,' Feehery said. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a hard-charging Republican, told the Palm Springs gathering that 'there are a bunch of Democrats who have taken as their talking point that the Koch brothers are the nexus of all evil in the world. Harry Reid says that every week.' 'Let me be very clear, I think that is grotesque and offensive.' 'I admire Charles and David Koch,' Cruz said. 'They are businessman who have created hundreds of thousands of jobs and they have stood up for free-market principles and endured vilification with equanimity and grace.' Strange bedfellows: David Koch posed with conservative flamethrower Ann Coulter (left) and liberal news maven Arianna Huffington (right) at the Time 100 gala . Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, shown Saturday at the Iowa Freedom Summit, told the crowd that the Kochs get a bad rap and are 'patriots' On the surface, Koch Industries appears to embrace values that liberals would applaud. The elder brother has trademarked the phrase 'Market-Based Management,' a philosophy that he applies to business. It calls for giving its 100,000 employees a bigger voice in decision-making, and demands that the company reinvests 90 percent of its earnings instead of pulling profits out for shareholders. The net result for the Wichita, Kansas company they inherited from their father is the second-largest privately held company in the nation. And David Koch in particular is a philanthropist of the first rank. He personally gave $100 million to build a theatre at Lincoln Center in New York City, $65 milion for a plaza at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and $100 million for an ambulatory care center at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. But all their spending on conservative and libertarian groups has turned the Kochs into the men liberals most love to hate. 'It's no wonder the candidates show up when the Koch brothers call,' former Barack Obama adviser David Axelrod told the Times. 'That's exponentially more money than any party organization will spend. In many ways, they have superseded the party.' Charles Koch thanked his group's members on Saturday night for helping Republicans win a congressional landslide in November, an event he reportedly called 'an important step in slowing down the march toward collectivism.' Freedom Partners founded a super PAC in 2014, giving the brothers a critical tool to run openly partisan political ads. The trade-off was a rare bit of transparency. The super PAC spent $25 million on the elections, of which trusts controlled by the brothers contributed about $4 million. Freedom Partners is the central hub for the Koch-backed network that includes groups like the activist-recruiting Americans for Prosperity, the millennial-targeting Generation Opportunity and the Hispanic-wooing Libre Initiative. But unlike political parties covered by strict campaign finance laws, the Koch collection of organizations is mostly made up of nonprofit groups that do not disclose their donors. Democrats have heavily criticized the Kochs' spending in politics and lack of transparency. A Washington Post-Center for Responsive Politics analysis of the Koch-linked network found $407 million in spending during 2012's elections. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul appeared at the weekend Freedom Partners gathering in California, trying to sell donors on his libertarian brand of noninterventionist foreign policy with an eye toward 2016 . Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told the Koch-backed gathering that  Hollywood and left-leaning media outlets exert influence over politics that's at least equal to what the Kochs can muster . Freedom Partners' twice-as-large 2016 budget was included in a Monday briefing that Freedom Partners officials offered a record 450 allies and donors who huddled in Palm Springs. Two people familiar with the budget disclosed the sum on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal plans. Charles and David Koch typically end their twice-a-year summits with company advisers urging likeminded donors to pledge to open their checkbooks and support their campaigns. The events offer donors access to  top lawmakers as well. For instance, likely presidential contenders Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida appeared together for a policy discussion. Another likely candidate, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, also was on hand. Rubio was asked by ABC News journalist Jonathan Karl, the forum's moderator, whether there is 'too much influence in politics by super wealthy donors on both sides.' 'As opposed to Hollywood or the mainstream media, you mean, or other multi-million dollar entities that try to influence American politics every day?' Rubio asked. The crowd went wild.","Charles and David Koch plan to organize 450 conservative donors into a political force that will rival political parties themselves .

"Sarah Broom, 42, had no idea why she was suddenly struggling to control her asthma symptoms . Sarah Broom had no idea why she was suddenly struggling to control her asthma symptoms. The nurse had been diagnosed with the condition in 2006, after developing a tickly cough and wheeze. But once diagnosed, she rarely had asthma symptoms as her condition was controlled with her preventer and reliever inhalers. Then, in March 2011, she had an asthma attack and was admitted to hospital after going to A&E. 'I was wheezing, coughing a lot at night and couldn't breathe properly - but, unusually, my reliever inhaler wasn't helping,' says Sarah, 42, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. Doctors gave her stronger medications, including a nebuliser, which creates a mist of higher-dose medicine breathed in through a mask, and steroid tablets to reduce the inflammation in her airways. Sarah was admitted to hospital again that September, October and November - each time two or three days before her period. Looking back, she realised the March attack had also occurred just before her period and wondered if hormones could be to blame. 'I knew that my asthma triggers were cold weather, dust, or a cold - but, in those instances, inhalers helped,' she says. 'When I suspected my hormones could be causing my attacks, I looked back at the results of my daily peak flow meter tests, which measure how quickly you can exhale air and indicate your lung function. 'They showed levels of my airflow dropped about a week before every period, becoming critical about two days before and improving a few days after a period ended. My consultant said that he'd seen such cases before.' Asthma - which affects 5.4 million Britons - makes airways become inflamed when in contact with a trigger, causing characteristic symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath and wheezing. Typically, pollen, dust and pet hair have been identified as common triggers - but, increasingly, evidence suggests that hormones can be a significant trigger in women. 'It's thought that 25 to 40 per cent of female asthmatics may have pre-menstrual associated asthma symptoms, with 4 to 5 per cent having a more severe deterioration, which may lead to an attack,' says Dr Adrian Draper, a consultant respiratory physician at BMI Shirley Oaks Hospital, in Croydon, and St George's Healthcare NHS Trust, in London. And it's telling that asthma is more likely to affect adult women during their reproductive years. Before puberty, asthma affects more boys than girls; after puberty, when girls' levels of female sex hormones - such as oestrogen and progesterone - rise, more women are affected than men. Adult-onset asthma is more common among women. Professor John Studd, a former consultant gynaecologist at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, in London, says it is likely to be the hormone changes that occur between ovulation and a period starting that cause the symptoms. As well as puberty, a key time when asthma can first develop in women is the years before the menopause (known as the peri-menopause), when they experience irregular periods and fluctuating hormones. Though asthma is often thought of as a childhood disease, it can first develop at any age. A key time when asthma can first develop in women is the years before the menopause . 'Worryingly for these women, their condition is more likely to be severe, with many experiencing more asthma attacks at this early stage,' says Kay Boycott, chief executive of charity Asthma UK. 'Yet years of underfunding of research - and the lack of women in clinical trials - mean the exact reasons why more adult women have asthma than men remain a relative mystery.' Women who already have asthma may also find it gets worse around the menopause, says Ms Boycott. Indeed, 76 per cent of callers to the Asthma UK helpline are women, and many are aged 45 to 55 - the average age of the menopause in Britain is 51. A study published in the European Respiratory Journal last year found that menopausal women with asthma had a 95 per cent higher risk of symptoms. Ms Boycott says women need to be vigilant with their asthma care during those years, making sure they have annual asthma reviews with their doctor or nurse and a written asthma action plan, including steps on how to lower their risk of a potentially-fatal asthma attack. After the menopause, when hormone levels have fallen and stabilised, asthma incidence declines in women, unless they take hormone replacement therapy (HRT), according to a 2009 paper from the Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society. Pregnancy can also affect asthma. During this time, hormone levels are not fluctuating, progesterone levels are consistently high and oestrogen is suppressed. A third of pregnant women with asthma will find their symptoms improve, a third get worse and the rest stay the same - so hormones seem to affect their asthma differently, says Dr Draper. Typical asthma treatments, such as inhalers and steroids, may have little effect when hormones seem to be a trigger - instead, some women can only control symptoms through treatments that target hormones. 'Chest physicians don't always recognise the effect hormones can have on asthma, which is a tragedy because it is easily treated,' says Professor Studd. He adds that oestrogen patches, gels and creams, which suppress ovulation and hormonal changes, can help. In extreme cases, and once a woman has completed her family, she may be offered a hysterectomy, with removal of her ovaries followed by the appropriate hormone replacement therapy. Yet while some studies have found that oestrogen treatments are effective, others show progesterone is the key. 'More research is needed because many of the existing studies are contradictory,' says Dr Draper. 'Asthma varies hugely among patients, so it's likely hormones won't affect all women in the same way. Treatments should be tailored to the individual.' Once Sarah's doctors realised the significance of her monthly cycles, they tried a number of treatments not usually given to treat asthma. Initially, she was given drugs to reduce her oestrogen levels. When these didn't help, she was given three-monthly injections of Zoladex, a treatment more commonly given to treat breast and prostate cancer, which acts on the pituitary gland in the brain to prevent production of oestrogen and progesterone. Asthma treatments such as inhalers and steroids may have little effect when hormones seem to be a trigger . But every time Sarah had the jabs, she initially suffered an asthma attack, resulting in a hospital stay. Last February, she ended up on a ventilator and spent three weeks in intensive care, because her oxygen levels were so low and due to developing pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs) as a result of the asthma attack. She was taken off the Zoladex, but the lack of oxygen caused lasting memory and balance problems. She was also left with drop foot (weakness or paralysis in one foot) because of the position she was put in while she was unconscious. 'Half the month, my asthma was controlled by my medication, but they didn't work when it was bad,' says Sarah, who has been unable to work since late 2011 as a result of her condition. 'When it gets worse, it feels as if I'm trying to breathe sucking through a straw that's stuck together - I'm desperately trying to get air in, but I can't. 'I was so desperate for a normal life again that I'd planned to get my ovaries removed last spring - even though I don't have children - but my severe attack in February meant I wasn't well enough for surgery.' However, there was a reprieve - the Zoladex appeared to have triggered the menopause as Sarah's periods stopped, and her asthma symptoms improved. But last September, her periods and symptoms returned. Her consultant advised she took the mini-pill, which contains only progesterone. So far, it has been effective. Sarah believes there are other women who haven't realised hormones are affecting their asthma. 'I don't think all doctors are aware of this link, either,' she says. 'More needs to be said about it so women can get the treatment they need.' asthma.org.uk .","Sarah Broom, 42, was suddenly struggling to control her asthma .

"A 16-year-old high school student is facing jail time after a shocking attack on his physics teacher that was captured on video. The ninth grader at John F. Kennedy High School in Paterson, New Jersey, was filmed by a classmate as he slammed his 62-year-old teacher to the ground over his phone being confiscated. After security guards were called to the incident, the boy was suspended from school and later arrested at home on third-degree aggravated assault charges. Police have not released the names of the suspect or the teacher. Altercation: The student is seen wrestling with the teacher who tried to carry on with his lesson as the boy grabs him around his waist . Fight: The student then slams the 62-year-old physics teacher into a desk as other students watch on . David Cozart, the school's principal of operations, said that the boy became irate after his teacher took the cellphone from him. In the 23-second clip posted to YouTube, the student can be seen wrestling with the teacher who tried to carry on with his lesson as the boy grabs him around his waist and slams him into a desk. Other students can be heard shouting for the student to 'stop' and 'chill' but none tried to physically stop him during the assault. Some were seen moving away from the scene saying 'I'm out, I'm out' and others hollered for the security saying 'Someone help him'! Lee McNulty, a retired JFK teacher told NorthJersey.com: 'What strikes me is that the teacher never even defended himself, that just shows how much teachers are afraid of losing their job.' Bad behavior: In this part of the video the boy is seen dragging the teacher to the floor as he towers over him . Class: Other students can be heard shouting for the student to 'chill,' and one, seen here, tried to get the boy to stop afterwards . Peter Tirri, president of the Paterson Education Association, the teachers union, added that he was 'disappointed' that other students didn't try to help the teacher. 'Maybe they were afraid, I don't know,' he said. Jonathan Hodges, a veteran school board member told the site: 'It's troubling that in our society today students think that inside a school they can put their hands on each other and teachers.' 'I went online trying to find this video and I found numerous videos of teachers being attacked by their students.' The student will be home schooled during his suspension. A disciplinary hearing will reportedly determine his status for the remainder of the school year.","The ninth grade student was from John F. Kennedy High School, Paterson .

"Armed to the teeth with handguns and assault rifles, these are the Pakistani teachers trained to kill in defence of their classrooms. Following a government announcement that teachers in Peshawar, Pakistan, will be armed and receive combat training to 'engage' terrorists, this is the first group pictured to undergo their instruction. The initiative is a response to the December 16 tragedy in which a group of terrorists stormed the city's Public Army School, massacring 145 people, including 132 schoolchildren. Two teachers practice aiming an assault rifle as they receive their weapons training . The women, in Peshawar, Pakistan, practice releasing the magazines and reloading the guns . The announcement that teachers and school staff members would receive arms training in the region was a response to last month's deadly terrorist attack, in which 132 schoolchildren were killed. Pictured are two teachers learning how to use a handgun and an assault rifle . Officials in Peshawar, capital of Khyber Pakthunkhwa province, said the move would allow teachers to fight off terrorists 'for [an] initial five to 10 minutes' before back-up arrives. The group of eight teachers were trained by an instructor in how to use various handguns and Kalashnikovs, as well as the principles of taking cover before returning fire. Pictures show the group, from Frontier College, assembling, loading and looking down the sights of the guns at the behest of a weapons instructor. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa information minister Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani has said the training would allow school staff members to 'engage' attackers for five to ten minutes before law enforcement personnel could respond. He told reporters on January 13: 'The provincial cabinet has decided to allow teachers and other staff members to keep their licensed weapons with them so that in case of any eventuality they could engage attackers for initial five to 10 minutes before personnel of law-enforcement agencies will show up to respond to the attack.' The 35,000 educational institutions - including schools, colleges and universities - across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been ordered to beef up security following the brutal attack on the Army Public School. A schoolteacher from Frontier College cocks a handgun during the training session, in which teachers were taught how to use guns, take cover and return fire . Mr Ghani also announced earlier this month that authorities would build walls at least 8ft high around government-run education institutions, and would also introduce community policing systems whereby civilians with experience operating weapons would be trained and paid to guard educational facilities. Private sector schools, colleges and universities have meanwhile been issued with strict guidelines with requirements including having guards, Mr Ghani said, adding that schools' licenses could be revoked if they did not follow the rules. In response to the Taliban attack, Pakistan's parliament last week passed a constitutional amendment approving the establishment of military courts to hear terrorism-related cases. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif also lifted the country's six-year-old moratorium on the use of the death penalty, reinstating it for terror cases in the wake of the slaughter at the school. However, critics have warned the move to arm teachers could put children at even greater risk, as well as affect teachers' performance at work. Two teachers watch on as they are taught how to operate a handgun, training which will allow them to 'engage' terrorists should their school come under attack .

"Australian paramedics are being flown to the UK to fill staff shortages despite the fact the industry is crying out for more ambulance workers locally. The London Ambulance Service has 175 Australians starting work this month in an attempt to fill staffing gaps. But unions in Australia say the industry needs more funding to create more jobs so Australian paramedics are not seeing overseas as a more attractive option. Scroll down for video . Ambulance trusts are being forced to recruit paramedics from as far away as Australia because of a shortage in British staff (file picture) The issue of staffing shortages for Australian ambulances was highly publicised last year when there was a significant delay in paramedics reaching cricketer Phil Hughes, who later died from severe head injuries. Australian Paramedics Association secretary Gary Wilson said in NSW ambulances don't have enough resources to cover the work they need to undertake. 'Unfortunately delays in ambulance response are becoming more common and it comes down to a system-wide lack of resources,' he said. 'The ministry won't approve staff increases. Losing 175 paramedics to fill a shortfall overseas doesn't make our situation worse it just doesn't help us. Six of England's ten ambulance trusts have recruited or plan to recruit from countries including Australia, Poland and Ireland (file picture) 'What happens here is we need hundreds more paramedics but we don't have approval or funding for those positions.' The Australian paramedics - many of them recent graduates - will work 37.5 hours a week and be paid a salary of between £30,295 ($A57,753) and £39,061 ($A74,396) - 25 and 60 per cent more than they earn in Australia. They also received relocation costs and a three-week training course on working in London, including dealing with incidents on the Underground. Danny Hill, assistant secretary of the Victorian chapter of Ambulance Employees Australia, said local graduates were paid a base rate of about $46,000 and work minimum 48-hour weeks. 'Paramedics in Australia are very highly trained and are probably looking at other countries where they can practice their skills internationally, and of course they'll look at the wage rates,' Mr Hill said. 'But whether they're going to England or the U.S. or leaving the industry altogether the key issue is what's making paramedics leave Australia, and that's got to be dealt with in every state. 'A lot of them are only lasting in the job five years and that's because of burn out - a lot of the time they become so fatigued and are under enormous stress.' The issue of staffing shortages for Australian ambulances was highly publicised last year when there was a significant delay in paramedics reaching cricketer Phil Hughes . Hughes, seen here on a stretcher at the SCG, later died from severe head injuries . London Ambulance Service bosses travelled to Australia and New Zealand last year, employing three quarters of the 200 graduates they interviewed. They will return there in March for another 280 interviews. Six of England's ten ambulance trusts have recruited or plan to recruit from countries including Australia, Poland and Ireland, according to figures gathered by the Health Service Journal. In total, 183 paramedics have been brought in from overseas since April, compared with just one in the previous financial year. Mitchell Hand, from Sydney, said the fact London was the busiest ambulance service in the world, receiving up to 5,000 calls a day, was what attracted him. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'That's what you look for as a graduate. You want to use your skills you've spent three years at university learning. It's the unknown that attracts you here.' Another new recruit from Sydney, Simone, told the programme: 'I don't have plans to go back home because the career advancement is too good.' An LAS spokesman said it targeted Australians because 'their skills and training closely match those in the UK'. Staff shortages have been blamed on a lack of training places and paramedics being 'actively recruited' to the NHS 111 service or as disability benefits assessors. Sarah O'Donoghue, of the union Unison, said pressure on existing staff was driving more to leave their jobs. Yesterday the Department of Health was in talks to avert a 12-hour strike by ambulance staff on Thursday.","London Ambulance Service has 175 Australians starting work this month .

"Your party shoes are primed or drinking boots are ready to be filled, but in a new city how will you know where to go? It's a most common travel predicament that a London party planner is keen to solve once and for all. Whether it's New York, Rome or London, there's a genuine risk in a strange city of  spending the night wandering aimlessly into all the wrong places or, worse still, being herded into the tackiest of tourist 'hot spots'. London businessman Richard Walker-Smith has  launched Zoola Fix, a website connecting visitors to cities with their 'Fixers' across 14 countries, for this very reason. It's already proving a hit with revellers, he says, and an app is set to launch this year. Uriel in Miami charges $120 per night to arrange dinners, drinks and says he attracts VIP treatment . London businessman Richard Walker-Smith is behind Zoola Fix's worldwide bespoke nightlife company . The Fixers, local movers and shakers, take a fee from groups keen to be squired around the city by those in the know, to hand-picked clubs, bars, restaurants and more. Party tour guides, if you will, the Fixers will spend as little or as much time with their clients as requested. Their skill set includes securing passage through the most intimidating club security cordons or simply picking out and booking the best table in town - especially handy if you don't speak the long language. 'Fixers' such as Zarah, an Austrian artist based in London, apply to go on Zoola Fix's books and potential clients chose their host based on their advertised interests. Zarah's specialty is trap, grime and hip-hop . Walker-Smith, 27, is also one of the Fixers, and so far the only one on the Zoola Fix website to have received a user rating - both of them the maximum five stars from groups who rave about his bespoke evenings to the weirdest and most wonderful clubs London has to offer. His company, since launching in December, has spread quickly around some of the world's most popular party destinations. He opened up applications for Fixers from nations beyond the initial US and UK, which has numerous fixers covering London and Manchester on January 8. The Fixers will help tourists get in to the most exclusive clubs in each city, such as Boujis in London . Julia is an art director who's keen to show visitors around the top night spots in Hamburg, Germany . The list of cities is growing daily and extends to Sydney, Copenhagen, Hamburg and Antwerp, with Milan and Rome in Italy also covered. 'Our Fixers have had bookings from the US, Russia, Lebanon, Dubai, Italy, Colombia, Israel, Greece, Turkey, France, UK and more,' says Walker-Smith. 'So far London has been by far our most in-demand city for bookings, with New York seeing the highest number of Fixer applications. 'We now have Fixers in 14 cities and this number is increasing daily. We only opened the platform to countries outside of the UK this month so growth has been fast.' The site, set out almost like a dating page but for party-goers, has profiles for each of the Fixers whose credentials for facilitating a terrific night out in their respective city have been assessed before they made the grade. Potential clients and the Fixers communicate via a secure messaging service before they are on the same page and are comfortable enough to exchange numbers. From there, high-end evenings in the most exclusive New York clubs or a fun night of karaoke and dive bars can await. Sydney-based Sarah knows 'where to get the ultimate beans and beats' in the land Down Under . While it's a cinch to find Bondi for a day in the sun, Sarah leads clients to places Sydney locals only know . Game designer Ben (left) can show clients around San Francisco's dive and karaoke bars while Vancouver-based Taylor (right) says her 'crew is the movers and shakers of the local electronic music scene' From their profiles, Zoola Fix's masters of the night are essentially keen to show clients a good time. Some are local club promoters while others simply like to show off their cities best attributes. Fixers tend to be from those who aren’t constrained by a 9–5 job, so we have a lot of creative types such as artists, actors, musicians, models and people in the fashion industry, or from those already working in the nightlife or hospitality industry,' Walker-Smith says. 'Guests so far have been a mix of both leisure and business travellers but it’s also occasionally being used by existing residents of a city. Most have been in their late 20s and 30’s but we’ve had interest and bookings from groups in their 40s, 50s and even 60s!' Other cities on the books include Miami in the States, Sydney in Australia, Antwerp in Belgium, Vancouver in Canada, Copenhagen in Denmark, Hamburg in Germany, Milan and Rome in Italy and Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Fashionista Julia takes her guests beyond the sights found in Hamburg brochures for 350 euros . Milan's Filippo works for a local party planning website while New York's Danna assists a high-end crowd . The exclusive clubs, bars and restaurants of New York are accessible via a range of New York experts . New York-based Danna, 37, charges a hefty $350 for her Zoola services. She specialises in the high-end of the market and claims to 'know everyone and their mother in NYC.' Vancouver local Taylor, 25, is entrenched in the cosmopolitan Canadian city's electronic music scene but also knows her way around its extensive network of craft breweries and cocktail bars. In San Francisco, 33-year-old Ben charges just $95 and is happy to help his guests have a big night out of dancing, an impromptu dive bar crawl or sing their hearts out at a  karaoke club. If Bondi Beach and beats is your thing and you happen to be in Sydney, Sarah can lead you in the right direction while club promoter Mathias, Zoola's only Antwerp Fixer so far, guarantees that if there's a VIP section his clients will get access after his initial fee of 150 euros. The catch is that the price includes only the Fixers' services, their tailoring a night to the client's needs, and not additional drinks, cover charges (unless the fixer knows a loophole) and transport. However the Fixer can line up for your drinks and order you a taxi. Walker-Smith (centre) says Zoola has already attracted clients from the US, Russia, Lebanon, Dubai, Italy, Colombia, Israel, Greece, Turkey, France, UK and more . London, the city in which Zoola was launched in December last year, is by far its most popular location . Walker-Smith, enjoying a balloon pit at London's Cirque le Soir, has five-star reviews on the site . The be connected with a 'Fixer', users simply go to the website, select their city of choice and scroll through their ever-growing database. Fixers, should they be willing and able to meet the clients' requests, are obliged to accompany their guests for six hours but can stay for less or more time if mutually agreed. Walker-Smith says his company offers authentic tastes of nightlife in the world's most happening cities without needing to resort to a package club or organised bar crawl. Zoola Fix is an extension of Walker-Smith's company Zoola Live, his introduction into the nightlife scene with which he organised a series of underground parties. The entrepreneur also claims to have introduced fish pedicures to the UK after discovering them at a Cambodian night market and opened the short-lived Zoola Bowl cereal restaurant.","Zoolafix.com launched in December and now serves 14 countries .

"Brutal crime: Hyphernkemberly Dorvilier, 22, has been charged with killing her newborn baby by setting her ablaze in New Jersey . A woman accused of dousing her newborn daughter with accelerant, setting her on fire screamed 'it's not mine' as a man held her down, according to audiotape of a chaotic 911 call. Hyphernkemberly Dorvilier of Pemberton was told that she was 'disgusting,' by a horrified woman who called 911 from the scene. Dorvilier told the woman, 'It's not mine, it's not mine,' then said, 'I didn't do it, I didn't do it, I didn't do it.' Authorities say the 22-year-old had given birth to the baby shortly before her death. They say she somehow hid the pregnancy from her family. When the baby was found, she still had the umbilical cord and placenta attached, investigators said. Prosecutors haven't specified a motive for the killing. It took police and paramedics more than seven minutes to arrive at the scene in Pemberton Township, Burlington County, New Jersey, reports The Philadelphia Inquirer. A dispatcher was initially unable to interpret the correct address from a frantic 911 caller, while another neighbor also reported fighting and screaming in the street before discovering the infant. 'There's a baby on fire,' the first 911 caller told dispatchers. In the background, a man could be heard telling Dorvilier to get down. 'You're not going anywhere,' the man told her.

'You just had the baby,' the 911 caller told Dorvilier. 'I didn't know,' Dorvilier replied. 'Well, then, who had it?' the woman asked. 'How could you do this? You should have dropped it off at the hospital.' 'I'm sorry,' Dorvilier says repeatedly. The baby was alive and breathing when she was flown to a hospital in Philadelphia, but she died two hours later. Police said they found a trail of blood leading from Dorvilier's home and she appeared to be bleeding while at the hospital afterward.

Dorvilier was found with a can of WD-40 and a lighter in her jacket pocket, and the baby suffered third-degree burns over about 60 percent of her body, investigators said in court documents released by Burlington County prosecutors. A memorial service was held Monday for the baby. A vigil was held last week which Dorvilier's mother and two sisters attended. The baby has now been named Angelica Dorvilier by her family.","Hyphernkemberly Dorvilier 22, is charged with the murder of her newborn .

"Shocking pictures of a ski resort wrecked by members of a University of Michigan fraternity earlier this month are only half the story. It turns out, members of several other Greek life organizations from the Ann Arbor, Michigan school held a similarly debauched rager at a another hotel that same weekend. Combined, the damage done to the Treetops and Boyne Highlands resorts from January 16 -18 is estimated to total more than $75,000. Since then, the six fraternities and sororities implicated in the two parties have been suspended by their national organizations while the university and police investigate the incidents. Wrecked: The Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity and Sigma Delta Tau sorority are being accused of causing $50,000 in damage to the Treetops Resort in Gaylord, Michigan earlier this month . Destroyed: It has since been revealed that another disastrous party happened at another ski resort about an hour away, involving four other fraternities and sororities from the University of Michigan. However the Boyne Highlands resort is not revealing pictures of the damage. Above, a wrecked room at the Treetops Resort where members of Sigma Alpha Mu and Sigma Delta Tau stayed the weekend of January 17 . Legal action: It's estimated that both parties resulted in a combined $75,000 worth of damage. Both resorts are looking into pressing charges . Barry Owens, the manager of the Treetops Resort, is considering suing over the $50,000 in damage more than a hundred members of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity and Sigma Delta Tau sorority caused to 45 unites of his hotel in Gaylord. Mr Owens said he has a meeting set up with University officials to discuss what happened at his resort, and pending the outcome of that meeting might pursue criminal action. 'I've been in this business for 30 years and it's the worst condition of rooms that I've ever seen,' Mr Owens told USA Today. 'There were broken ceiling tiles in the hallway, broken furniture, broken windows. There's carpet that's going to need to be replaced. The rooms were just a pigsty. 'They caused an excessive amount of damage.' Sigma Alpha Mu chapter President Joshua Kaplan previously said his members 'are embarrassed and ashamed of the behavior' of some members. Punishment: All of the fraternities and sororities implicated in the parties have been put on suspension by their national organizations which means they won't be allowed to host parties or represent their groups on campus . Historic: Barry Owens, the manager of the Treetops Resort, says the 45 rooms be rented to the groups were left in 'the worst condition' he's ever seen in his 30 years in hospitality . He said that his fraternity 'accepts full responsibility' and 'will be working with the management of the resort to pay for all damages and cleaning costs'. 'This behavior is inconsistent with the values, policies, and practices of this organization,' Kaplan said. 'We will work within our own organization and with university officials to hold those who are responsible accountable for their actions.' Similar charges may also be brought up by the Boyne Highlands Resort here members of Pi Kappa Alpha and Chi Psi fraternities held another party that same weekend in conjunction with the Delta Gamma and Alpha Phi sororities. Resorts spokesman Erin Ernst said that the group booked rooms in two blocks, and caused an estimated $25,000 in damage by breaking furnityure and doors, soiling carpet and upholstery, punching holes in walls and smoking in non-smoking room. Scene: Above, the Sigma Alpha Mu (left) and Sigma Delta Tau (right) houses at the University of Michigan. The fraternity and sorority are accused of wrecking their rooms at the Treetops Resort in Gaylord . Ernst said they are not releasing images of the damage, since the management company does not own the building and publishing the pictures would be a violation of their landlord's privacy. 'One of the group's units was far worse than the other,' Ernst told The Ann Arbor News. 'Obviously our owners are not pleased. Showing this level of extreme disregard to our properties is ridiculous. We will be looking at implementing new policies when it comes to young people booking at our properties.' In addition to possible criminal charges, Ernst says they will be looking into getting payment for the time they couldn't rent out the damaged condos. It's believed that members of even more University of Michigan fraternities and sororities may have been involved in both parties. Ruined: Above, the Boyne Highlands resort where members of the Chi Psi and Pi Kappa Alpha fraternities held a similarly destructive party with the Delta Gamma and Alpha Phi sororities . A spokesman for Boyne Highlands says one block of rooms was more destroyed than the other. Above, the Pi Kappa Alpha and Chi Psi fraternity houses at University of Michigan . Chi Psi and Pi Kappa Alpha allegedly rented out two blocks of rooms at Boyne Highlands with members of the Delta Gamma (left) and Alpha Phi (right) sororites . Suspension by their national organization means the members of the six fraternities and sororities involved may continue to live in their campuses houses but can not participate in social activities, including holding parties or representing their organizations at university functions .They also won't be able to vote in Greek life councils. University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald says the suspension gives the university and authorities time to investigate the incident and determine appropriate action. 'It's more important to make sure we get the right information and move forward following our established processes than to do it by a specific deadline,' Mr Fitzgerald said. The university community has expressed scorn at the way the fraternity and sorority members represented their institution - ranked one of the top public colleges in the nation - during the out-of-control weekend ski trip. 'These incidents simply do not reflect the University of Michigan's values or its expectations,' said E. Royster Harper, vice president for student life. 'The behaviors are a contradiction of what it means to be in and of a community, and we do not believe that being away from campus is a license to act in destructive and irresponsible ways.' Three student body leaders also reacted to the incident this week. The joint letter from Student body president Bobby Dishell, Interfraternity Council president Alex Krupiak and Panhellenic Association president Maddy Walsh wrote that the parties were 'an act of shocking disrespect'. 'We, as leaders and Greeks at the University of Michigan, do not tolerate these kinds of acts, nor do we let such behavior fall under the radar. We intend to handle this situation with the utmost efficiency, and we will ensure that those responsible for the damage to the properties will be held accountable throughout this process,' the statement reads.","University of Michigan fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu was the first to be blamed for a destructive party at Treetops Resort earlier this month .

"Britain would be a ‘better, stronger country’ if fewer people moved here from abroad, David Cameron claimed today. The Prime Minister insisted he did not regret his pledge to cut net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ despite latest figures showing it hitting 260,000. He vowed to continue to pursue the target, despite admitting there was little he could do to curb numbers from the EU apart from limiting access to benefits. David Cameron promised 'no ifs, no buts' to reduce net migration to the 'tens off thousands' but latest figures show 260,000 more people arrived in the UK than left in the year to June, including a record 228,000 extra immigrants who arrived from elsewhere in the European Union . Mr Cameron claimed that cutting immigration to the levels seen in the 1980s would mean it would cease to be a major political issue. The rise of Ukip in recent months has been partly fuelled by their warning that Britain cannot control its borders while in the European Union. Before the last election Mr Cameron pledge 'no ifs, no buts' to reduce net migration to the 'tens off thousands' during this parliament. But latest figures show 260,000 more people arrived in the UK than left in the year to June, including a record 228,000 extra immigrants who arrived from elsewhere in the European Union. Mr Cameron admitted his pledge would not be met, but refused to drop it. He told BBC Radio 2: ‘We’ve made some progress but not as much as I’d like. The Prime Minister vowed to continue to pursue the 'tens of thousands' target, despite admitting there was little he could do to curb numbers from the EU apart from limiting access to benefits . ‘In terms of immigration from outside the EU it’s now down at its lowest level for many years cos we have put a cap on the number of economic migrants that can come from outside the European Union to Britain. ‘But inside the European Union migration has gone up, partly because we are creating more jobs than the rest of Europe put together, and that’s why I put the toughest possible welfare reforms for foreign migrants coming to Britain. ‘It was a commitment I made which I want to keep.’ Asked if he regretted making the promise, the Prime Minister insisted: ‘No. I believe that we would be a better, stronger country if we had net migration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands. ‘The figures are very clear, I have not achieved that. I want to keep going until we do achieve that. I think it’s the right thing for our country.’ Mr Cameron claimed that by limiting the number of people moving to the UK, public concern about immigration would decline. ‘Back in the 1980s when we had an open economy, we had migration in the tens of thousands, and do you know what immigration ceased to be for many years a political issue on our country’, he said. ‘I think the British public are intensely reasonable about this issue. They recognise that immigration is good for the UK, but they feel it hasn’t been controlled properly, they want the numbers brought under control. ‘And I want to achieve that pledge because it would be good for our country.’ Senior Tories had pushed Mr Cameron to announce a plan to cap the number of people from within the EU able to move to Britain, or impose an ‘emergency break’ if large numbers moved from countries with economic problems. But the idea was ditched amid warnings from other EU countries, including Germany, that the principle of freedom of movement was non-negotiable. Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum before the end of 2017. He has promised ‘four big changes’ to welfare, designed to deter people from moving to Britain. Mr Cameron claimed that cutting immigration to the levels seen in the 1980s would mean it would cease to be a major political issue . Mr Cameron added: ‘First of all they won’t be able to claim unemployment benefit. Second of all if they are still here after six months without a job they have to go home. ‘Third of all if they stay and work they have to contribute to our system for four years before they get work-related welfare benefits. ‘And fourth if they keep their families at home in the country from which they come, they cannot receive British child benefit. ‘Those four changes I think will have a profound and fundamental effect on the numbers coming from the EU countries to Britain. ‘At the same time no immigration policy will work unless we train up British young people in court schools and apprentice system better than if we also reform.’","Prime Minister insists he does not regret 'no ifs, no buts, promise in 2010 .

"These massive walls of fat, sewage and wet wipes have been discovered in a network of sewers. In the last six months Southern Water has found more than 6,000 tonnes of ‘fatbergs’, which clog up pipes when people flush items down their toilets or pour fat down the sink. These materials - weighing, in this case, the same as 2,000 fully grown hippos - do not break down and cause blockages in the pipes. Scroll down for video . Disgusting: In the last six months Southern Water has found more than 6,000 tonnes of ‘fatbergs’ which clog up pipes when people flush sanitary items down their toilets or pour fat down the sink . As waste can no longer pass through the system, pressure builds in the underground pipes and causes sewage to explode back up into people’s homes or through manholes. According the Southern Water, Kent is the worst place in the South to find blockages, with 2,155 tonnes of fatbergs cleared from the county’s sewers. And almost 2,000 tonnes of unflushable material was found below Hampshire. Southern Water said it costs millions of pounds each year to clear the fatbergs, which is passed on through water bills. A spokesman for the firm said: 'People think that because it is out of sight out of mind they do not have to worry about it. But it is still there, lurking in the pipes and can come back into their homes.’ Unpleasant: Eastney pumping station in Portsmouth, Hampshire - a county where almost 2,000 tonnes of unflushable material was found underground . The company added that one of the biggest problems it faces is wet wipes that claim to be safe to flush, but do not degrade like toilet paper. Paul Kent, Southern Water’s waste water strategy manager said: ‘The use of wet wipes and things like make-up wipes, moist toilet tissue and cleaning wipes apparently rises by 15 per cent each year - but this trend is putting a strain on our sewers. ‘Unlike toilet roll these wipes don’t break down when flushed, so frequently cause blockages. They can get tangled up in the pumps and filters. Even those said to be flushable cause problems. ‘They don’t biodegrade so can still lock pipes further down the line. Flushing them causes a pain in the drain, which is why we urge people to only flush the three Ps - pee, poo and paper.’ Clearance: Rag collecting at Budds Farm in Havant, Hampshire. Apart from wet wipes, cooking fat is said to cause huge problems for sewers - as it settles in the pipes it becomes hard like concrete . Apart from wet wipes, cooking fat is said to cause huge problems for sewers. As it settles in the pipes it becomes hard like concrete and will not let waste water pass through the pipes. These blockages have to be cleared by hand using large rods or high powered water jets to dislodge the walls of blocked waste. Hampshire County Council councillor Sean Woodward - in charge of economy, transport and environment in the region - said he was not surprised at the vast amount of fatbergs found in the sewers. ‘People don’t seem to take a great deal of care about what they flush down the toilets,’ he said. ‘No product other than toilet tissue should be put down the toilet. At these sewage pumping stations the blockage can be literally explosive.’ The average weight of a hippo is 6,500lbs (three tonnes), according to National Geographic.","Southern Water finds more than 6,000 tonnes of 'fatbergs' in six months .

"When Szmul Zygielbojm stood up and denounced 'the greatest crime in history' in 1942 the Polish politician was revealing to the world for the first time the full horror of the unfolding Holocaust. Three years before the liberation of the death camps, Zygielbojm issued his clarion call but also sowed the seeds of his own destruction warning it would 'be a shame to go on living' if nothing were done. Just a year later, the Jewish activist took his own life in his London apartment when he realised that Allied leaders and world opinion could not or would not do anything to stop the horror. Scroll down for video . Hero: Szmul Zygielbojm, a Polish politician forced to flee his country after standing up to the Nazi regime, was the first person to expose the full horror of the 'final solution' to the wider world . To compound his despair Zygielbojm had learnt that his own wife and child had perished at the hand of the Nazis during the uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto in the early part of 1943. Until now, however, the extraordinary story of this left-wing activist and politician has remained cloaked in obscurity despite the fact that Zygielbojm's secret network help expose the Final Solution. Born in eastern Poland, Zygielbojm became heavily active within Jewish trade unions and when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 he took part in organising the Warsaw defence committee. When the Nazis ordered Jewish leaders to help with the creation of a ghetto in the Polish capital, Zygielbojm publicly opposed the command - and was subsequently smuggled out of the city. After travelling to Belgium, France and the US, where he spoke at a series of meetings to raise awareness about the plight of Jews, he eventually found himself in London in March 1942. Realising that he was dealing with a sceptical non-Jewish public, Zygielbojm used British newspapers and the BBC to pass on detailed information he was being supplied with from occupied Europe. In June 1942, The Daily Telegraph headline read 'Germans murder 700,000 Jews in Poland' and readers were told it was 'the greatest massacre in the world's history.' Exposed: His network of informers were able to supply information about what was happening to the Jews in Europe - estimating about 700,000 had been killed by June 1942. Pictured: Children at Auschwitz in 1945 . Horrifying: By the end of the war, 11million people had died in the Holocaust, of whom six million were Jewish . The source for this story was Zygielbojm, by now a member of the Polish government in exile, who provided information that 'an average of 1,000 Jews were being gassed daily'. Zygielbojm's network of informants had gathered eye-witness accounts from across Europe, not least the industrial scale of the mass murder with gas chambers being used. Although Winston Churchill had denounced the Nazi crimes against the Jews as a 'crime without a name' as early as 1941, credible and detailed evidence was supplied by Zygielbojm and his network for the first time. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'It will actually be a shame to go on living, to belong to the human race, if steps are not taken to halt the greatest crime in human history. 'In the name of millions of helpless, innocent, doomed people in the ghettos, whose unseen hands are stretched out to the world, I beseech you, you whose conscience is still alive: Expunge the raging shame which is being perpetrated against the human race.' 'Crime without a name': British Prime Minister Winston Churchill publicly denounced the killings, but help was not forthcoming immediately . Delay: It would take another two and a half years for the Allies to liberate the death camps Zygielbojm warned them about in 1942. Pictured: Holocaust survivor Mordechai Ronen (centre) is overcome by emotion during the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz . One of the key pieces in this jigsaw was the Christian Jan Karski, who was the link between the Polish underground resistance and the Polish government in exile in London. When he was in the Warsaw Ghetto, Karski relied on a guide called Leon Feiner, who also belonged to the Bund, the same Jewish left-wing organisation that Zygielbojm was a member of. But when Karski relayed the situation to the British and American governments, as well as Zygielbojm, in late 1942 it became clear that the Allies were unable or unwilling to act. When Zygielbojm asked Karski what message, if any, he had from the Jews trapped in the Warsaw Ghetto, Karski relayed a message from Zygielbojm's comrade Leon Feiner. Karski later revealed the message from Feiner: 'This is what they want from their leaders in the free countries of the world, this is what they told me to say: ""Let them go to all the important English and American offices and agencies. Tell them not to leave until they obtain guarantees that a way has been decided upon to save the Jews. Let them accept no food or drink, let them die a slow death while the world is looking on. Let them die. This may shake the conscience of the world.""' In April 1943, the US and UK governments met in Bermuda, supposedly to come up with answers to the unfolding plight of Jews in occupied Europe. Ironically this happened just as the Jewish resistance rose up the Warsaw Ghetto despite facing overwhelming numbers of well armed Nazi troops. An estimated 13,000 Jews died during the uprising and the 50,000 or so survivors were immediately shipped to extermination camps. Uprising: In 1943, the US and British governments met in Bermuda to discuss the plight of the Jews in Europe. At the same time, the Jewish people living in the Warsaw ghetto began to fight back . Hope: Zygielbojm was hopeful something was finally being done by the Allied forces . Dashed: But he realised that they were not going to act - and the people of the Warsaw ghetto were being taken to their deaths . In May, Zygielbojm realised that the Allies were not going to act and then, to compound his despair, he learnt that his wife Manya and son Tuvla had died in Warsaw. That month he took an overdose of sodium amytal at his home in west London and left a long and detailed suicide note, explaining his decision to take his own life. He wrote: 'I cannot continue to live and to be silent while the remnants of Polish Jewry, whose representative I am, are being murdered. 'My comrades in the Warsaw ghetto fell with arms in their hands in the last heroic battle. I was not permitted to fall like them, together with them, but I belong with them, to their mass grave. 'By my death, I wish to give expression to my most profound protest against the inaction in which the world watches and permits the destruction of the Jewish people.' Heartbroken: At about this time, Zygielbojm learnt his wife and son had been killed in the ghetto uprising . Suicide note: 'I cannot continue to live and to be silent while the remnants of Polish Jewry, whose representative I am, are being murdered,' he wrote . Parting shot: 'By looking on passively upon this murder of defenceless millions tortured children, women and men they have become partners to the responsibility,' he added . But he also issued a parting shot in the direction of world opinion and the Allied leaders who had singularly failed to act in any shape or form to try and bring a halt to the slaughter. He wrote: 'The responsibility for the crime of the murder of the whole Jewish nationality in Poland rests first of all on those who are carrying it out, but indirectly it falls also upon the whole of humanity, on the peoples of the Allied nations and on their governments, who up to this day have not taken any real steps to halt this crime. 'By looking on passively upon this murder of defenceless millions tortured children, women and men they have become partners to the responsibility.' After the war Karski, who died in 2000, expressed his regret that he had 'stupidly repeated the message which Feiner gave me' and that Zygielbojm had then 'lost control'. When Karski heard of the death, he said: 'I was crushed. I realised at that time at that time that everything is lost for the Jews. He was a soldier to the end. Yes, he was a genuine martyr.' But the story doesn't end on an entirely sad note because one of Zygielbojm's children did survive. Joseph became a leading light in the Polish resistance during the war and eventually made his way to the US where he became a scientist in the US space programme before he died in 1995. Joseph's sons Arthur and Paul both live in the US.","Szmul Zygielbojm was the first to reveal full horror of the Holocaust in 1942 .

"Fossilised remains of four ancient snakes have been dated between 140 and 167 million years old - nearly 70 million years older than the previous record of ancient snake fossils. The incredible find could change the way we think about the origins of snakes, and how and when they came to be. This new study makes it clear that the sudden appearance of snakes, some 100 million years ago, reflects a gap in the fossil record, not an explosive radiation of early snakes. Fossils from the UK, US and Portugal have revealed four ancient snakesDating back up to 167 million years. Illustrated here is Parviraptor estesi, a snake that lived during the Upper Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous periods. Its fossil was found in Swanage, UK . Led by scientists at the University of Alberta, the findings were published in the journal Nature Communications. The four snakes were found in two locations in the UK, Kirtlington Quarry in Oxfordshire and Swanage, Colorado in the US and near the city of Leiria, in Portugal. These are not new findings, though - rather, the discoveries were made by re-analysing fossils that had previously been classed as lizards. Closer inspection, though, revealed them to be ancient snakes. The oldest known snake, Eophis underwoodi, is known only from very fragmentary remains and was a small individual, though it is hard to say how old it was at the time it died. It was found in Kirtlington Quarry in Oxfordshire, UK. The largest snake, Portugalophis lignites, came from coal deposits in Portugal, near Guimarota. It was a much bigger individual at nearly 3.3ft (one metre) or more in length. Several of these ancient snakes (Eophis, Portugalophis and Parviraptor) were living in swampy coastal areas on large island chains in western parts of ancient Europe, while the North American species, Diablophis gilmorei, is found in river deposits from some distance inland in Western Colorado. According to IBTimes UK, the smallest and oldest of the small snakes is Eophis underwoodi, which lived 167 million years ago and was about ten inches (25cm) long. It is thought to have eaten insects, tadpoles and small minnows. The next oldest was Diablophis gilmorei, from 155 million years ago, was found in Colardo, while another from the same period, Portugalophis, was the largest of the fossils found. The latter reached up to four feet (1.2 metres) in length and likely ate larger pretty such as small mammals, lizards and even dinosaurs. The most recent, Parviraptor, came from 144 million years ago and lived among freshwater snails. While the ancient snakes share some features with modern snakes, notably sharp, backward-pointing teeth, and their lengths can be estimated, their exact shape and body form is unknown. But the finding could help explain when and why snakes lost their limbs, and ultimately evolved into the smooth creatures we see today. The four snakes were found in two locations in the UK, Kirtlington Quarry in Oxfordshire (shown) and Swanage, Colorado in the US and near the city of Leiria, in Portugal . On the left is an illustration of the dinosaur-eating Diablophis gilmorei, which also lived in the Upper Jurassic period, found in the Morrison Formation in Colorado. On the right is Portugalophis lignites, the fossil of which was found in the coal swamp deposits at Guimarota, near the city of Leiria in Portugal . These images show some of the fossils that were analysed. Top left is the dentary (lower jaw) of Portugalophis, and bottom left is its maxilla (upper jaw). Top right is the dentary of a python for comparison, while bottom right is the maxilla of Parviraptor . This animation shows the dentary (lower jaw) bone of one of the discovered snake fossils, the Portugalophis lignites, which has been noted for its similarity to modern snakes with backwards-pointing teeth . 'The problem of how limblessness evolves is pretty much unknown, though modern developmental studies have identified some of the gene cascades that seem to shut down and stop limbs from forming,' lead author and professor Dr Michael Caldwell, from the Faculty of Science at the University of Alberta, told MailOnline. 'Limblessness is extremely common among living groups of lizards, so common in fact that one genus in Australia, Lerista, has about 110 species in it, all of which show every possible version of limb loss from fully limbed with five toes, a tiny limb with one toe on the front and a tiny rear limb with two toes, to completely limbless. 'Why? It's not understood at all. I wish I could answer the question better, though the one thing I can add is that 100 million-year-old snakes still had back legs.' Despite the finding, there also remains a large knowledge gap between 140 and 100 million years ago, a period from which no known fossils exist. 'The study explores the idea that evolution within the group called 'snakes' is much more complex than previously thought,' Dr Caldwell said. 'Importantly, there is now a significant knowledge gap to be bridged by future research as no fossils snakes are known from between 140 to 100 million years ago.' The findings could help explain when and why snakes lost their limbs, and ultimately evolved into the smooth creatures we see today. Pictured is a Python sebae, or Afrcan rock python, in Kenya . From 167 to 100 million years ago, snakes evolved towards the elongated and limbless bodies that characterise them today. The researchers add that the distribution of these newer oldest snakes, and the anatomy of the skull and skeletal elements, makes it clear that even older snake fossils are waiting to be found. 'Based on the new evidence and through comparison to living legless lizards that are not snakes, the paper explores the novel idea that the evolution of the characteristic snake skull and its parts appeared long before snakes lost their legs,' explained Dr Caldwell, . He added that the identification of definitive snake skull features reveals that the fossils, previously associated with other non-snake lizard remains, represents a much earlier time frame for the first appearance of snakes. The concept of how snakes originated and evolved needs to be reassessed in light of this new information, according to the researchers.","Fossils from the UK, US and Portugal have revealed four ancient snakes .

And they could reveal how snakes evolved into modern limbless creatures ."
"Five guards and four foreigners were killed when gunmen stormed a luxury hotel in Tripoli, triggering an hours-long standoff. The attack on the Corinthia Hotel, which sits along the Mediterranean Sea, underscores Libya's lawlessness since the Western-backed campaign to overthrow and kill Muammar Gaddafi. The US State Department said it was looking into reports of an American casualty in the attack, which only ended when two of the attackers blew themselves up with a grenade. Libyan militants sympathetic to the Middle East's Islamic State insurgency claimed responsibility for the attack. Scroll down for video .

Security forces check a screenshot of one of the suspected terrorists inside Corinthia Hotel . The attack started in the morning and included a car bombing, said Essam al-Naas, a spokesman for a Tripoli security agency. Libya's security forces responded and after several hours of a stand-off, the attackers threw a grenade at the security forces, killing themselves and a security guard. Ten people were also wounded in the attack, including security guards and guests. 'The operation is over,' Mr al-Naas said, but added that the streets around Corinthia remained closed. He said an investigation was under way. Earlier in the day, Mahmoud Hamza, commander of the Special Deterrent Force, told private satellite television station al-Nabaa that five foreigners were killed, without elaborating, but Mr al-Naas later revised the casualty toll. It was not clear if the two assailants were the only ones involved in the attack, earlier reports claimed one militant had been arrested. As the standoff developed, a security official said the gunmen had taken hostages, though he had no further details. Two commercial landmark towers behind the hotel were evacuated out of security concerns, he said. A member of staff in the hotel said the attack began when five masked gunmen wearing bulletproof vests stormed the hotel after security guards at the hotel's gate tried to stop them. He said they entered the hotel and fired randomly at the staff in the lobby. The staffer said the gunmen fired in his direction when he opened his door to look out. He said he joined the rest of the staff and foreign guests fleeing out the hotel's back doors into the parking lot. When they got there, he said a car bomb exploded in the parking lot, only a hundred meters away. He said this came after a protection force entered the lobby and opened fire on the attackers. He said two guards were immediately killed. The staffer spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared being targeted later by militants. He said the car bomb left at least five cars in the parking lot burned and damaged some windows in the hotel's facade. He said the hotel had Italian, British and Turkish guests, but it was largely empty at the time of the attack. He said the militia-backed Prime Minister Omar al-Hassi usually resides at the hotel, but was not there Tuesday. Al-Hassi's security guards also weren't there, he said. The hotel previously came under attack in 2013 when a former prime minister was abducted there. EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini expressed concern, calling the attack 'another reprehensible act of terrorism which deals a blow to efforts to bring peace and stability to Libya' In a brief statement on Twitter, the Tripoli branch of Isis claimed to have stormed the hotel . EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini expressed concern, calling the attack 'another reprehensible act of terrorism which deals a blow to efforts to bring peace and stability to Libya'. She expressed 'solidarity with the victims and their families' but provided no details of casualties. 'Such attacks should not be allowed to undermine the political process,' Ms Mogherini said in a statement. A spokesman for the Malta-based Corinthia Hotel chain, Matthew Dixon, told AFP by telephone: 'Our thoughts are with our staff and guests. We have no further information.' Since Gaddafi's ousting, Libya has been torn among competing militias and tribes vying for power. The Islamist-backed Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn) militia alliance took control of Tripoli last summer, forcing the country's internationally recognised government to flee to the far east. The militia-backed government in Tripoli said the target of the attack was Prime Minister Omar al-Hassi. Spokesman Amr Baiou told reporters Mr al-Hassi was unharmed. In a brief statement on Twitter, the Tripoli branch of Isis claimed to have stormed the hotel, the SITE Intelligence monitoring group said.","Tripoli branch of Isis claimed it stormed the Corinthia Hotel in the city .

"A  father who tried to get a restraining order after he discovered footage of his son's mother screaming at their young boy- has had his case thrown out of court. Shane Hamre was horrified when he discovered the shocking video on his son's iPad. It shows a woman in her mid-twenties - said to be the boy's mother-  recording herself singing along to a track while her sons play in the background. Scroll down for video . Shane Hamre has posted the video of this woman in her mid-twenties- said to be the boy's mother- singing along to a track while using the iPad to record herself . Suddenly she is distracted from her singing, puts the device down, and is heard screaming at the youngsters. Her shouts are punctuated by several 'smacking' sounds, which Mr Hamre claims was the mother hitting the children. The concerned father posted the video on Facebook and wrote: 'I found this video on my son's I pad that was obviously recorded by his mother. I apologize for the horrible singing, but watch and listen after the 1 minute mark. 'You will hear her smacking my son and her other son, and the God awful things she screams at my poor son,' he added in the Facebook post. 'My son watched this with me and he was terrified his mother would find out I watched this and that he would be hit again. He said she hits him when she is mad. Nobody's kid deserves this.' Mr Hamre, believed to be from Josephine County, Oregon, had taken the footage to Kitsap County Court, in Washington in an attempt to get a restraining order. But he says judges refused and the young boy was sent back to his mother because they agreed that her household was more 'stable' as she was married. Suddenly the woman is distracted from her singing after one of her two children, heard playing in the background, spills milk . 'She argued in trial that her house is the more stable household because she would be at home all the time and they would be around her husband because it was highly unlikely he'd get sent away from Fort Bragg,' he wrote on Facebook. 'I knew she was like this, I just couldn't convince a judge.' In the video, the mother, seems to become angry after her one of her children spilled some milk. She stops singing Blown Away, by Carrie Underwood, takes the headphones out of her ear, and walks off camera. She is then heard shouting: 'Get over here. 'Go clean it up. 'I am a single parent, I don't have a daddy to help me, it's just you two. Clean it up, with that. Go clean up the milk and you go help him. 'You spoiled brats, go clean up the milk.' Mr Hamre added that the reason the woman, based in North Carolina, shouts she is a single parent was because her husband was often away. The video was originally posted to Facebook Hamre on January 5, and it was later uploaded to YouTube and has since received over 2 million views. Mr Hamre has also made a report to Child Protection Services but he says they were unwilling to act as there were no bruises visible on the children or other supporting evidence. Looking annoyed she walks off camera and is then heard  screaming at the youngsters .","Shane Hamre discovered the video of his son's mother on his child's iPad .

"A rapist has been jailed after his schoolgirl victim confronted him more than 30 years later and asked 'do you remember me?' Father-of-two Christopher Martin pounced on his victim, then aged 15, after he offered to walk her home from a social club in Manchester in 1980. After the attack the landscape gardener, now aged 51, was able to return to his 'care-free' life, as the girl kept quiet about the ordeal. Christopher Martin, 51, has been jailed for seven years after being convicted of the historic rape of a teenage girl in 1980 . But a chance encounter more than 30 years later, led his victim to finally find the courage to report Martin to the police. The court heard the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons,  approached Martin after seeing him and his family enjoying themselves at a festival and said: 'Are you Christopher Martin. Do you remember me?' He was jailed for seven years after a jury convicted him of rape following a trial at Manchester Crown Court. Martin had claimed that his was the victim of mistaken identity, but the jury disbelieved his version of events. The jury heard his victim had trusted him to walk her home from the social club more than 30 years ago. 'She was excited at the prospect of being walked home by you', said Judge David Stockdale QC, sentencing. 'She thought you were something of a catch, and that your offer meant an indication that you were interested in her. As it turned out you were interested in her, but in all the wrong ways.' The victim, now a grown woman, repeatedly slapped Martin around the face as he launched his attack. After Martin had raped the girl he left her 'covered in blood',  in the dark, isolated corner of the park. At the time the girl only confided in her best friend about what had happened in the park. It was not until June 2013 that she saw Martin again, enjoying himself with his family at the Didsbury Festival in Manchester, and confronted him. She saw him and again days later in the pub and made the decision to go to the police. Martin was convicted following a trial at Manchester Crown Court, pictured above, in which the jury were told that he was confronted by his victim in 2013 . Police said the victim finally had the courage to come forward after seeing him again and reading in the press about a number of historic rape cases. Martin's barrister said he had lived 'a very ordinary, unremarkable, blameless life', working consistently and caring for his elderly parents and disabled older brother. She said: 'He has two very small children. Those two children are of an age where they will notice their father is no longer present. The two children inevitably will feel the consequences of the custodial sentence which is imposed upon Mr Martin.' Martin of  Fallowfield, Manchester, was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life. After the case, Detective Constable Laura Hughes said: 'The victim was so scared after she had been raped that she felt she could not report it to the police. 'However recently she saw Martin a number of times and her memories of the attack came back to her and this along with the media reports regarding historic rapes gave her the confidence to come forward and report the incident to the police. 'I would like to praise her for having the courage to come forward and speak to us over three decades after the attack happened. 'I hope that this sentence provides some encouragement to other people who may have been victims of this sort of abuse to report it to the police.'","Christopher Martin, 51, convicted by a jury of a historic count of rape .

"Married school caretaker Joseph Hart tried to order a 12-year-old girl from a notorious paedophile for £100 an hour by text but has been spared jail . A married school caretaker who tried to order a 12-year-old girl by text from a notorious paedophile for £100 an hour  has been spared jail. Father-of-three Joseph Hart contacted Darren Leggett via a website when police intercepted their messages and raided Hart's home in Horwich, Bolton. He was negotiating by text message for the girl to be sent to him and the deal was at an early stage, Bolton Crown Court heard. Hart, 32, was convicted of arranging a child sex offence, but spared an immediate jail term. He was given a two-year suspended sentence. He was immediately suspended from his job at Chorley New Road Primary School - and has now been banned from working with children. His former employer Bolton Council stressed that none of the charges related to his employment or place of work. Officers found 61 indecent images of children on his computer when he was arrested, the court heard. The caretaker, who has Asperger's syndrome and an obsessive compulsive personality, initially claimed he was trying to trap paedophile Leggett. But a jury rejected this and found him guilty of arranging a child sex offence. He admitted six further counts relating to the indecent images before his trial in November. Sentencing him to a suspended two-year prison term yesterday Judge Elliot Knopf said Hart's case was 'unique' and that the deal was in its 'early stages'. He also said the defendant did not understand the 'outcome of his actions'. Hart made contact with Leggett by text on February 6, 2012 after finding him on a website. He was immediately suspended from his job at Chorley New Road Primary School (pictured) - and has now been banned from working with children . But Kent Police arrested Leggett on February 10, seizing a phone which was found to contain texts sent between February 6 and 9. Hart, of  Horwich, was arrested in May the same year and was subsequently suspended by Bolton Council. Hart arrived at court expecting to be jailed and had a suitcase with him in the dock. Vanessa Thompson, defending, said Hart had been married with three children, but that he had split from his wife since the case came to light. She said: 'He is never going to work for the council again and never will he work in the capacity he was before.' Judge Knopf said: 'Your case is different and complex and in many respects unique. 'You are someone who suffers from Asperger's and the result of it would appear to be an obsessive compulsive personality, and you do not understand the outcome of your actions. Hart contacted notorious paedophile Darren Leggett via a website when police intercepted their text messages and raided Hart's home in Bolton . 'It is an explanation as to how you came to be involved in all of this. 'The arrangement with Leggett was very much in embryonic form. No venue had been agreed for what was to happen. Very little had been discussed. 'Once Leggett was out of the way there is no evidence that you tried to pursue enquiries with anyone else.' A council spokesman said: 'We can confirm that Mr Hart was immediately suspended from duty as soon as he was arrested and no longer works for the council. None of the charges related to his employment or place of work.' Hart was given a prison sentence of two years, suspended for the same period, for arranging a child sex offence. He was given a concurrent nine-month sentence for the six charges of making indecent images. The former caretaker was placed on the sex offenders' register for 10 years and given a five-year sexual offences prevention order. Leggett, a convicted paedophile from Kent, was jailed indefinitely in June, 2012, for 31 counts of child sex abuse. He raped his three victims - all aged under 13 - then made 36 harrowing films of the sickening abuse for others to see. The paedophile's six-year campaign of abuse saw him create his own websites from his parents' house, which itself was just a short walk from a local primary school. The sex offender was jailed indefinitely, although his tariff will be a minimum of seven years. Maidstone Crown Court heard the quiet supermarket employee first came across the youngsters in the aisles of the store where he worked, then later gained access to the children. Leggett’s six-year campaign of abuse was only uncovered when a boy he abused told a teacher what had been happening to him.","Joseph Hart contacted paedophile Darren Leggett via a website .

"A former Oakland Raiders cheerleader has launched her own class-action lawsuit against the NFL team in a bid to win back pay for the grueling hours and conditions she claims she was forced to endure. Susie Sanchez, who filed her lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on Monday, was part of a group of 90 cheerleaders who brought a combined lawsuit against the Raiders a year ago. She is now the third former Raiderette to publicly reject the team’s ‘meager’ proposed settlement of $1.25 million announced in September. Susie Sanchez, above, who was a 37-year-old grandmother when she made the Raiderette squad in 2011 has become the third ex-cheerleader to reject the team’s ‘meager’ proposed settlement of $1.25 million . As well as claiming that she was denied basic minimum-wage and overtime compensation, her action also states that cheerleaders were denied promised media opportunities, reports SFGate. Sanchez was 37 years old when she finally realized her dream to become a Raiderette in 2011. As a mother of three and grandmother she was the oldest cheerleader on the team. Her attorney, Drexel Bradshaw, said his client was promised ‘opportunities for exposure’ in the media but the team ‘denied those opportunities when it didn’t suit the Raiders or the NFL. ‘She was approached by numerous media and entertainment outlets about her life story and then franchise employees blocked access to her suit themselves.’ The cheerleaders were paid $125 per home game, or $1,250 per season, in a contract that also included hours of unpaid rehearsals, charity and commercial appearances. The cheerleaders were paid $125 per home game, or $1,250 per season, in a contract that also included hours of unpaid rehearsals, charity and commercial appearances . The women say their pay translated to less than $5 an hour. California's minimum wage is $9 an hour. Sanchez has also accused the team of ‘deplorable’ working conditions. Her lawsuit states that cheerleaders were regularly forced to attend ‘grueling’ training sessions at the beginning of each season that they weren’t paid for. The suit also says cheerleaders were forced to 'ignore lingering and painful injuries during rehearsals and games for fear of being ""benched"" or fined.' The Raider's proposed $1.25 million settlement covers 90 women who worked as cheerleaders during any of the four NFL seasons from 2010 through 2013. The cheerleaders would get about $6,000 for each year they worked between 2010 and 2012, and $2,500 for 2013, when the Raiders increased their pay. The proposed settlement would also cover all unpaid expenses and minimum wages, plus interest.

"Council tax inspectors will be stripped of their right to barge into your home, under new laws published today. Thousands of officials from the Valuation Office Agency, part of HMRC, have the automatic right to enter homes and businesses to value them for council tax and business rates. But the law will be changed within weeks to force inspectors to go before a judge if they want to force their way in. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said he wanted to cut the number of ‘snoopers’ with powers of entry . Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said he wanted to cut the number of ‘snoopers’ with powers of entry. Mr Pickles said: ‘I am a firm believer that we should be cutting down on the number of Government snoopers who can barge into a person’s home. ‘This Government has clamped down on the overuse and abuse of snooping with over 300 powers of entry already being abolished as well as stopping spy cars and bin snoopers. ‘We are now curtailing the powers of council tax inspectors. This complements the steps we have taken to stop a council tax revaluation and terminate the tax revaluation database to protect hard-working people from unwanted tax rises.’ There are nearly 3,000 VOA officials who can use entry powers to force their way into someone’s home or a business premises, the Department for Communities and Local Government said. The law will be changed within weeks to force inspectors to go before a judge if they want to force their way in. The change in the law would force them to obtain access with the consent of the owner and, if this cannot be secured, go before a judge to make their case. Officials said the use of a tribunal would give greater scrutiny to entry attempts. The law will be changed using powers created by the 2012 Protection of Freedoms Act and will require a vote in Parliament. It is expected to come into force in March. It follows a review of powers of entry laws by the government. Ministers have pledged to reduce the number of powers to enter people’s homes to a minimum. A report earlier this month revealed that an army of almost 20,000 council busybodies has the right to barge into homes and businesses – including bizarre powers to check on pot plants and fridges. Big Brother Watch found a staggering 1,065 pieces of invasive legislation that let bureaucrats inspect someone’s home, often without a warrant or police escort. Meaningless regulations include those allowing officials to investigate whether any imported pot plants have a ‘passport’ - documents showing they do not carry any diseases or insects that could devastate British wildlife if released into the environment. Snoopers can also inspect a property to make sure ‘illegal or unregulated hypnotism’ is not taking place under a law from 1952, look at the energy rating on fridges, and check hedges are not too tall.","Thousands of Valuation Office Agency officials have right to enter home .

"ASBI family: Trudie Birch, 27, leaves the Birch family flat in Gloucester, where she, her parents, her sister and their boyfriends have been taken to court over their anti-social behaviour . A problem family taken to court after subjecting neighbours to a seven-year campaign of fighting, shouting, swearing and fly tipping insisted today 'we're not that bad' and called their many critics 'petty'. The Birch family has been given a rare joint anti-social behaviour injunction - similar to an ASBO but aimed at problem housing tenants. Michael Birch, 68, Jane Beard, 52, and their daughters Trudie, 27, and Ellen, 21, are now on a final warning to behave or face being kicked out of their home in Podsmead, Gloucester. To avoid further problems Robert Edward, 26, and Jonathan Ward, 25, who are dating the sisters, have also received injunctions banning them from the council flat. But the family, who are also accused of window smashing and keeping problem pets, maintain they are the victims claim their neighbours are being 'petty'. Retired Mr Birch said: 'We are not the troublesome family that we are being painted out to be. We have lived all over the city and we have had no problems like this before. 'I feel like when I go out people are looking out and saying 'there goes the family with the injunction order. 'The neighbours are just being petty. We keep ourselves to ourselves and we keep the noise to a minimum.' Housing association Gloucester City Homes say the family has been time-consuming and expensive to deal with since moving into the property in 2008. Gripes include arguing, foul language and physical fighting within the family home, where they have lived for seven years. The anti-social behaviour has to stop or they will be evicted, council bosses say. They have also been told to get rid of three snakes, five bearded dragon lizards, and some goldfish but are allowed to keep six cats, a dog and a budgie. Bad behaviour: The Birch family has been given a rare anti-social behaviour injunction - similar to an ASBO but aimed at problem housing tenants - for a long campaign of fighting, shouting, swearing and fly tippng . Mrs Beard, who claims disability allowance, accepted that there is sometimes a loud banging noise from the house but blamed her oxygen machine. Senior anti-social behaviour officer Charlotte Newman said the family are a 'long-standing nuisance'. 'Our priority is to ensure our tenants and local residents are able to live peacefully in their homes,' she said. 'If this means that legal action is required to tackle those that behave anti-socially, then that is the action we will take.' The injunction was obtained at Gloucester County Court on Friday and is believed to be the first of its kind to be issued anywhere in Britain in the last five years. An ASBI is similar to the ASBO, but was developed specifically to help councils and housing associations tackle anti-social behaviour in social housing areas. Gloucester City Councillor Jennie Dallimore, who lives in the Podsmead area of Gloucester with her husband and four children, said she endorsed the action taken against the family. 'I have known of this issue and this family for five years - there have been ongoing problems and intervention. 'This measure may seem extreme but everything has been tried. 'It has been devastating for those living around it. I have huge sympathy for people because it has been going on for such a long time. 'Podsmead is a great place to live and the area they live in is home to a lot of elderly people and it's unfortunate that this family have conducted themselves in the way they have, which is not acceptable.' Row: Despite their court case the Birch family maintain they're 'not that bad' and say neighbours and the council have been petty . An Anti-Social Behaviour Injunction (ASBI) is an order that prohibits a person or a family from engaging in housing-related anti-social conduct. They were brought in by the Government in 2011 to speed up how long it can take to evict problem tenants. The order is similar to an Anti-Social Behaviour Order (ASBO) but has been developed to help councils and housing associations tackle anti-social behaviour in social housing areas. The order can be used in a wider range of circumstances such as anti-social behaviour against hospital staff, shop staff, and  neighbours in the  rented sector. The injunction requires the person who is committing anti-social behaviour to comply with rules such as not entering a specific zone, or not causing nuisance to residents. They are issued by a county court and can range from six months to two years in length. An injunction can be applied for by the police, a local authority, a housing provider, the British Transport Police Force, Transport for London, the Environment Agency or the NHS Business Services Authority.","Family one of few in the country to be given an ASBI - a bad tenant ABSO .

"Stephen Hayes arrives at Plymouth Crown Court, Devon. He groped a blind woman who thought he was someone else in a nightclub and has been told he faces jail . A man who kissed and groped a blind woman who thought he was someone else in a nightclub has been told he faces jail. Stephen Hayes, 27, was on a night out at the Union Rooms pub in Plymouth when he began slow dancing with the woman, who has a visual impairment. Plymouth Crown Court heard she thought he was another man that she had met earlier that night and they began to kiss and cuddle. Hayes then went to touch her under her clothes and she realised her mistake and pushed him away with her knee. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, later made a complaint to police and Hayes was charged with sexual assault. He changed his plea to guilty after earlier denying the charge of sexual assault between August 1 and August 4, 2013. Because of her condition the victim can only recognise people by their body shape and clothing rather than facial features, the court heard. The court heard the woman said she had kissed Hayes on the dance floor but that she had done so by mistake. Prosecutors claim she soon realised it was not the friend she had been with earlier, but in fact a stranger. Prosecuting Jo Martin, said that Hayes approached the woman in the Union Rooms pub in Plymouth in Devon at about 1am. She was on a night out with friends but says she was not drunk as she had only had a couple of glasses of wine. The court heard she thought Hayes was a friend she had seen earlier that evening and they danced closely and started kissing. Miss Martin said that he moved to indecently touch her under her clothes and she then realised the man was not her friend. She said: 'She did not want to carry on'. Miss Martin said that he touched her sexually and she moved her knee to push him away. Hayes, 27, was on a night out at the Union Rooms pub in Plymouth when he began slow dancing with the woman, who has a visual impairment. Plymouth Crown Court heard she thought he was another man that she had met earlier that night and they began to kiss and cuddle . She added that a doorman who had seen some of what happened intervened. The woman did not make a complaint to door staff immediately but did tell a female friend what had happened. Miss Martin said: 'She decided that it was a horrible experience and that she would put it down to experience.' But she added that police were called when there was 'argy bargy' between Hayes and the woman's friends. The court heard she thought Hayes was a friend she had seen earlier that evening and they danced closely and started kissing. Miss Martin said that he moved to indecently touch her under her clothes and she then realised the man was not her friend . Miss Martin said an officer visited the woman at her home a few days later and that was when she decided to make an official complaint. She added that Hayes later said that he did not know the woman was disabled and that he believed what happened between them was consensual. This morning he pleaded guilty to indecently touching the woman without her consent. Judge Paul Darlow then formally directed the jury to reach a guilty verdict and warned Hayes he could be facing jail when he returns for sentencing on February 27.","Stephen Hayes, 27, met woman at the Union Rooms pub in Plymouth .

"One in five people carry a 'smart gene' variant linked to long lifespan, bigger forebrains and enhanced mental ability, researchers have found. Scientists found people who carry the gene have larger volumes in a front part of the brain involved in planning and decision-making. They say the find could have major implications for sufferers of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. Scroll down for video . Scientists found that people who carry the gene have larger volumes in a front part of the brain involved in planning and decision-making. The KLOTHO gene codes for a protein found in the kidney and brain that regulates many different body processes. About one in five people carry a single copy of the variant, known as KL-VS, that boosts levels of the protein and is associated with longer lifespan and improved heart and kidney function. A small minority, 3% of the population, has two copies, which is linked to a shorter lifespan. It follows the previous discovery that middle-aged and older people who have a single copy of the gene variant performed better in a wide range of mental tests. 'We've known for a long time that people lose cognitive abilities as they age, but now we're beginning to understand that factors like klotho can give people a boost and confer resilience in aging,' said senior author Dena Dubal of  UCSF. 'Genetic variation in KLOTHO could help us predict brain health and find ways to protect people from the devastating diseases that happen to us as we grow old, like Alzheimer's and other dementias.' The KLOTHO gene codes for a protein found in the kidney and brain that regulates many different body processes. About one in five people carry a single copy of the variant, known as KL-VS, that boosts levels of the protein and is associated with longer lifespan and improved heart and kidney function. A small minority, 3% of the population, has two copies, which is linked to a shorter lifespan. In the new study scientists scanned the brains of 422 men and women aged 53 and over who were also tested for the KLOTHO gene. They found that participants with a single copy of the gene variant also had a larger brain region known as the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC), which is especially susceptible to shrinkage with age. Loss of neurons in this area may be one reason why older people are sometimes easily distracted and find it difficult to multitask. The size of the rDLPFC predicted how well the study volunteers performed in tests such as working memory - the ability to hold onto newly acquired information - and processing speed. The results appear in the journal Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology. US researcher Dr Jennifer Yokoyama, from the University of California at San Francisco, said: 'The brain region enhanced by genetic variation in KLOTHO is vulnerable in ageing and several psychiatric and neurologic diseases including schizophrenia, depression, substance abuse, and frontotemporal dementia. 'In this case, bigger size means better function. 'It will be important to determine whether the structural boost associated with carrying one copy of KL-VS can offset the cognitive deficits caused by disease.' A previous study, funded by the U.S.-based National Institutes of Health, . found the protein  boosts brain skills such as thinking, . learning and memory. It is believed it could increase the strength of connections between nerve cells in the brain. 'Our results suggest klotho may increase the brain's capacity to . perform everyday intellectual tasks,' said coauthor Lennart Mucke, . professor of neuroscience at the University of California San Francisco. People . who have one copy of a variant, or form, of the kloto gene, called . KL-VS, tend to live longer and have lower chances of suffering a stroke . whereas people who have two copies may live shorter lives and have a . higher risk of stroke. As part of the study, researchers genetically engineered mice to overproduce klotho protein . In . the study, researchers found that people who had one copy of the KL-VS . variant performed better on a battery of cognitive tests than subjects . who did not have it, regardless of age, sex or the presence of the . apolipoprotein 4 gene, the main genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's . disease. Researchers also genetically engineered mice to overproduce klotho protein. The klotho-enhanced mice lived longer and had higher levels of klotho in the blood and in a brain area known as the hippocampus, which controls some types of learning and memory.","One in five people carry a single copy of the variant, known as KL-VS .

"Two shoplifters have been compared to Little Britain's Andy and Lou after using a wheelchair to steal from a store. CCTV shows a man pushing an apparently wheelchair-bound woman into a service station on the A45 near Coventry earlier this month. But when other shoppers backs are turned, the woman jumps out of the seat and starts stuffing items into her coat. Scroll down for video . CCTV from a Marks and Spencer store at a service station in the Midlands shows a woman being pushed into the shop in a wheelchair before jumping up and stealing food . Police are hunting the woman and her accomplice after the thefts near Coventry on January 11 . The footage later shows the woman having returned to the wheelchair as she is pushed out of the store by the man. Coventry Police said the pair 'seem to have taken their cue from the cult television comedy duo Andy and Lou'. A spokesman said: 'The woman in a wheelchair was caught on CCTV getting out of her seat and walking completely unaided around the store, in order to select goods from the shelves and conceal them under her coat. 'The man with her, who pushes her around the store, is also captured loading the woman’s rucksack with food items from the Marks and Spencer food store at a service station on the A45 in Finham.' The pair - both black and believed to be in their 30s - made off with £60 worth of meat from the food store . The spokesman added: 'Between them, the pair managed to get away with around £60 worth of packaged meat during their spree, which happened at around 5pm on 11 January. 'The woman in the wheelchair is described as black, in her mid-30s, around 5ft 7ins tall while the man is described as black, in his mid-30s and around 6ft tall.'

"The Care Quality Commission has warned that carers and nursing staff may be ignoring laws which state they must seek approval before restraining care home residents  (picture posed by model) Thousands of elderly and vulnerable patients are being illegally restrained by staff in hospitals and care homes, according to the care watchdog. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) warns that carers and nursing staff are ignoring laws which state they must seek approval before depriving patients of their liberty. Figures from the watchdog show that there is a backlog of nearly 20,000 cases waiting to be approved – and in the meantime staff may well be restraining patients anyway. Under a law introduced in 2009, staff who want to lock patients in rooms, use sedatives or be otherwise physically forceful must apply for a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguard. They commonly are used for dementia patients to prevent them wandering off or hurting themselves. Care home staff go to local councils and hospital employees to the NHS trust but almost half of applications are turned down as they are deemed unnecessary. But the CQC says there has been a such a rise in applications that there is now a worrying backlog awaiting approval. There were nearly 53,000 applications in the first six months of 2014/15, a seven-fold rise compared to the numbers submitted for the entire year of 2013/14. Figures from the watchdog also show that there 19,429 applications awaiting approval with local councils and NHS bodies, up from 359 for the same period last year. The CQC is concerned that staff are just using restraining measures anyway – illegally – while they wait for the paperwork to be completed. David Behan, its chief executive said: ‘While we recognise the pressure local authorities are under, this represents a worryingly high number of people being deprived of their liberty without external scrutiny and authorisation.’ ‘It is essential that all professionals looking after people who are unable to give consent deliver best practice in order to protect their rights.’ The huge rise in applications to councils followed two court rulings this year which stated individuals could be deprived of their liberty in foster care and sheltered housing. Initially, staff had assumed the law only applied to hospitals and care homes – and particularly dementia patients. George McNamara, Head of Policy and Public Affairs at Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘However the backlog of unresolved requests is unacceptable, with nearly 20,000 outstanding applications at the end of September 2014. Under a law introduced in 2009, care home staff or hospital workers who want to lock patients in rooms, use sedatives or be otherwise physically forceful must apply for a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguard (file picture) ‘This raises serious questions and leaves the worrying potential of a person being unlawfully deprived of their liberty simply because the paperwork is yet to be completed. ‘Depriving anyone of their liberty has to be a last resort, but when necessary it is essential it is closely monitored, legal and always with the best interests of the person in mind.’ In an annual report investigating the use of these orders, the CQC also uncovered harrowing cases of residents being illegally locked up in care homes. One woman with Huntingdon’s disease – a progressive brain condition – was kept in a home for more than a year even though her husband had only wanted her to stay for two weeks. Carers had decided it was in her ‘best interests’ to remain but delayed applying for a DOLS order for several months. The family appealed via the Court of Protection where a judge ruled her human rights had been breached and awarded her £27,000 in compensation. In another example, the CQC said staff at a care home were ‘routinely’ being too physically forceful with three patients when washing and dressing them including one who was given a sedative. Staff had not bothered to apply for a safeguard order or even consider whether it was in patients’ best interests.","Elderly and vulnerable patients being illegally restrained, watchdog claims .

"A solar system including five Earth-sized planets has been discovered, which is so ancient, it was born not long after the dawn of time. The system's parent star, named Kepler-444, is 117 light years from Earth and 11.2 billion years old. When the sun-like star was formed out of a primordial cloud of gas and dust, the universe was just a fifth of its current age. A solar system including five Earth-sized planets has been discovered, which is so ancient, it was born not long after the dawn of time. This artist's impression shows Kepler-444, 17 light years from Earth. Its planets (also shown) were detected from the dimming that occurs when they transit the disc of their parent star . The star was originally dubbed KOI-3158, but has just been re-named. Astronomers have shown that it hosts five planets with diameters ranging between those of Mercury and Venus. That makes them roughly the same size, or slightly smaller than Earth. ‘There are far-reaching implications for this discovery,’ said Dr Tiago Campante, from the University of Birmingham's School of Physics and Astronomy. ‘We now know that Earth-sized planets have formed throughout most of the universe's 13.8 billion year history, which could provide scope for the existence of ancient life in the Galaxy. ‘By the time the Earth formed, the planets in this system were already older than our planet is today. The planet hunter strikes again: Astronomers made the discovery after trawling through four years' worth of data collected by Nasa’s Kepler space telescope (illustrated) Astronomers made the discovery after trawling through four years' worth of data collected by Nasa’s Kepler space telescope. Dr Campante's team conducted the research using a technique called asteroseismology, which involves ‘listening’ to vibrations caused by sound trapped within a star. The oscillations led to tiny pulse-like changes in brightness, which allowed the researchers to measure the star's diameter, mass and age. The planets were detected from the dimming that occurred when they passed across the face of the star. By measuring the minute fading of light coming from the star the scientists were able to calculate the relative size of the planets. ‘This discovery may now help to pinpoint the beginning of what we might call the “era of planet formation.”’ He said in a talk earlier this year: 'Earth-size planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the universe's history when metals were more scarce.' However, the chances of an advanced race of beings living on any of the planets are remote, despite Kepler-444 being 25 per cent smaller and 700 degrees cooler than the sun. Each of the worlds is so close to its star that its year - the time taken to complete one orbit of the star - is less than 10 days long. At that distance, the planets would be much hotter than Mercury and unable to support Earth-like life. The system's innermost planet is the size of Mercury, the middle three are the size of Mars, and the outermost is slightly smaller than Venus. The scientists found an ancient planetary system containing five planets (shown at the bottom of the illustration, compared to other planets at the top). The system's innermost planet is the size of Mercury, the middle three are the size of Mars, and the outermost is slightly smaller than Venus . The Fermi Paradox questions why have we not found aliens, despite the existence of hundreds of billions of exosolar systems in our galactic neighborhood in which life might evolve. Physicist Enrico Fermi devised it in 1950.He believed it was too extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has yet been detected. He claimed there must be some kind of barrier that prevents the rise of intelligent, self-aware, technologically advanced, space-colonising civilisations. This barrier is sometimes referred to as a 'Great Filter'. The absence could be caused because either intelligent life is extremely rare or intelligent life has a tendency to go extinct. Astronomers discovered the system after trawling through four years' worth of data collected by Nasa’s Kepler space telescope. Dr Campante's team conducted the research using a technique called asteroseismology, which involves ‘listening’ to vibrations caused by sound trapped within a star.

The planets were detected from the dimming that occurred when they passed across the face of the star. By measuring the minute fading of light coming from the star the scientists were able to calculate the relative size of the planets. Professor Bill Chaplin, who co-authored the study, said: ‘The first discoveries of exoplanets around other sun-like stars in our galaxy have fuelled efforts to find other worlds like Earth and other terrestrial planets outside our solar system. 'We are now getting first glimpses of the variety of galactic environments conducive to the formation of these small worlds. Kepler-444, which is 11.2 billion years old, is a quarter of the Sun's size but bright enough to be seen with binoculars in the constellation Lyra (illustrated) ‘As a result, the path towards a more complete understanding of early planet formation in the galaxy is now unfolding before us.’ Kepler-444 is a quarter of the Sun's size but bright enough to be seen with binoculars in the constellation Lyra. Professor Steve Kawaler, a member of the team from Iowa State University, said: ‘This is one of the oldest systems in the galaxy. ‘Kepler-444 came from the first generation of stars. This system tells us that planets were forming nearly seven billion years before our own Solar System. ‘Planetary systems around stars have been a common feature of our galaxy for a long, long time.’ Kepler is a space observatory launched by Nasa in 2009 to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. It's designed to survey our region of the Milky Way in a bid to discover Earth-size exoplanets. It works by detecting regular variations in brightness of stars, which are caused by orbiting exoplanets passing in front of them. So far, the observatory has found 1,013 confirmed exoplanets in 440 systems as well as 3,199 possible planets. In November last year, astronomers said there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in habitable zones within the Milky Way, based on the data collected so far. Kepler was originally built to last three-and-a-half years, and since then, experts have worked to extend its life. But in August 2013, Nasa announced it had given up trying to fix two failed reaction wheels, meaning that the mission had to be modified. The 'K2 extension' was announced in May last year, meaning that the partially paralysed observatory will detect habitable planets around smaller and dimmer dwarf stars. Last month, Nasa announced that Kepler had found its 1000th confirmed exoplanet.","Solar system's parent star, named Kepler-444, is 117 light years from Earth .

"A Seventies rock star has barricaded himself inside his loft after he became locked in a bitter mortgage dispute with his building society - which is trying to sell his home. Former Wishbone Ash bass player, Mervyn Spence, claims he has been holed up in the attic of his £225,000 barn conversion in Lichfield, Staffordshire, since last Thursday. The 55-year-old found himself unable to meet the £1,400-a-month mortgage repayments to the Nationwide Building Society after hitting money troubles in 2008. Scroll down for video . Mervyn Spence, pictured inside his attic, has been holed up since Thursday in a bid to stop his building society selling his £225,000 barn conversion . He had organised an outdoor event, which had to be cancelled because of flooding, and was left paying out £150,000 in refunds. Mr Spence said his losses meant he was unable to get a mortgage with another company so he was effectively locked into his Nationwide deal. He claimed the building society had refused to budge on his interest rate of 5.5 per cent and was now selling the property for £160,000, which was £65,000 less than the offer accepted in 2013. The father-of-two even sold two of his prized guitars in 2010 to keep up with his repayments before he fell further behind in 2013. Nationwide then took him to court in January last year and a judge ruled they had the right to sell the two-bedroom detached house, where he lives on his own. The singer-songwriter, who was also a former member of 1970s band Trapeze, alleged that Nationwide sent in a 'team of heavies' to 'clear his home out' and lock the front door, last week. Mervyn Spence pictured (second right) with members of Seventies band Wishbone Ash in December 1984 . Standing outside his barn conversion, the bassist and singer-songwriter is refusing to leave after falling behind on mortgage repayments with his building society Nationwide . Friends have been keeping him topped up with food and he is writing songs on his guitar to keep his spirits up in the attic, which he uses as a recording studio. He claims he had been 'scammed' by Nationwide and said he would stay at his home until he was dragged out. 'I had always been on a tracker mortgage and Nationwide phoned me up and said ""we will put you on a normal rate"" in 2008,' he said. 'Then the rates dropped in 2009 to an all-time low and I thought great but my rate stayed at 5.5 per cent. 'There was no leeway at all. I've asked them and I've been complaining about it while I try and keep my head above water. 'I had to sell some guitars in 2010, I had a Fender Precision which I'd had since the 1970s and sold for about £1,200 to £1,500. 'The last payments I made were at the end of 2013 but I couldn't afford to make the full £1,400. The barn conversion in Lichfield, Staffordshire, (pictured) is due to be repossessed by bailiffs after Nationwide took him to court last January . He says he will stay in the loft until he is given £70,000 equity from property or they return the two or three percent 'they have taken since 2008' 'My name is on the property but a court ruled in favour of Nationwide that they have got the right to sell the property. 'I was scammed, my head was full of other things because I had £150,000 commitments to make, the last thing I thought about was the best mortgage deal. 'I put a bag together and have been in the attic since last week when they locked the house. 'There is no heating so it has been freezing but I keep my spirits up playing the guitar and writing songs. 'Friends have been helping me out and I'm eating sandwiches and fruit. 'If they drag me out of here which I'm sure it will come to at some stage I will be back down to their head office protesting. 'I hold them responsible and if they are going to make me homeless then I will become their responsibility.' He added: 'I want to do a deal. I either want them to give me the equity out of the property as it was valued, which would give me abut £70,000.

British rock band Wishbone Ash first rose to fame in 1970 with their debut self-titled album. They were formed in Torquay, Devon, out of the ashes of The Empty Vessels, which had been put together by founding member Martin Turner in 1963. Other members included Andy Powell and Ted Turner. The line-up would change several times over the years as members came and went. The band was considered to be one of the pioneers of using twin lead guitars. Popular records included Pilgrimage (1971), Argus (1972), There's the Rub (1974), and New England (1976). Wishbone Ash remained successful into the 80s and the original line-up reformed for a string of albums in 1987. Last year the band released its 24th studio album and the current line-up, which has been together since 2007, is the band's longest standing. The current members include original Andy Powell, Bob Skeat, Muddy Manninen and Joe Crabtree. 'I'm going to stay here as long as it takes. I don't care how much I stink, I'm prepared to be a rebel with a kind heart.' The singer, who joined Trapeze in 1982 before joining Wishbone Ash a year later, previously protested by busking outside Nationwide's headquarters in Swindon for three nights in November. He has now said he would do the same thing in Birmingham if his attic-bound resistance was not effective. Nationwide said it had tried to come to a workable solution with Mr Spence since his account fell into arrears in 2010 and added that his rate was 'completely fair and reasonable'. A spokesman said the firm had already gone 'above and beyond what would be expected of a reasonable lender and have made numerous attempts to accommodate Mr Spence and to find a solution which works for him and for the society.' The spokesman added: 'We have shown significant forbearance over a long period of time and have tried to do our best for Mr Spence. 'We do, though, owe it to our wider membership to ensure we do not sustain losses from such situations as this as, over time, this will affect the viability and sustainability of their building society. 'We are on Mr Spence's side but, for the wider membership, we need to be on their side too, and we will make sure we are.' The 1981 line-up of Wishbone Ash, which Mervyn Spence joined in 1983.

"A postman has documented the tales of being on the job by taking photos while he delivers. Seth Miller from Missouri has been dropping off mail for three years and decided to start taking pictures after stray dogs started following him on his route. The 21-year-old has encountered  grumpy stick insects, cross cows and chickens as well as several overly-affectionate dogs over the years. Postman Seth Miller, 21, has documented the tales of being on the job by taking photos while he delivers letters. He has encountered several animals and pets including a dog who jumped into his van one day . What you looking at? Moo-ve along! He said over the years he has come across cross cows (pictured) While he encounters overly-affectionate dogs, he also has met problematic dogs, who he says are not pictured in his photo album because he's too busy avoiding them . Seth said: 'The dog which jumped into my van was particularly interested in following me. 'When I got back from deliveries and opened my van door he thought we were doing for a ride. 'Unfortunately we don't deliver dogs - so I had to kick him out.' As if to confirm a widely-held belief, dogs have proved the most problematic animals on his rounds, he said: 'The really mean dogs aren't in the album because I'm too busy trying to avoid them.

"Apple today announced a record quarterly profit of $18billion (£11.8bn) - the biggest ever made by a public company. The U.S. tech giant also posted record revenue of $74.6 billion (£49.2bn) for the three months to December 31, outstripping the quarterly GDP of Israel, Greece or Denmark. Apple's cash pile is now $178 billion (£117bn), the equivalent to $556 for every American and bigger than the £95billion budget for Britain's National Health Service. Its landmark performance was driven by record-breaking sales for its iPhone 6 and 6 plus, with the firm revealing it sold 34,000 handsets every hour for the entire quarter. Apple said that it sold 74.5 million iPhones during the three months that ended Dec. 31, beating analysts' expectations for the latest models of Apple's most popular gadget, introduced in September. The surge in sales of Apple's signature smartphones helped make up for an expected decline in sales of iPad tablets. The company sold 21.4 million iPads, down 22 percent from a year earlier. Sales of Mac computers rose 9 percent, and Apple saw overall revenue gains in all geographic regions. Apple said  it sold 74.5 million iPhones in total, beating analysts' expectations for the latest models of its most popular gadget that were introduced in September. It also confirmed the eagerly anticipated Apple Watch will go on sale in April. The surge in iPhone sales drove the company's total revenue to $74.6 billion, up 30 per cent from a year earlier. This means its annual sales would beat the GDP of Israel ($264billion) and rank it around 50th in the world's richest countries. In turn, the the net profit of $18bn (£11.8bn) is the highest ever recorded by a public company, beating the previous record of $15.9bn (£10.4bn) set by ExxonMobil in 2012. Apple CEO Tim Cook, said: 'Demand for iPhone has been staggering, shattering out high expectations. This volume is hard to comprehend. 'We sold about 34,000 iPhones every hour, 24/7 for the entire quarter. We have sold over a billion devices running iOS.' Since taking over as CEO in 2011 following the death of Steve Jobs, the company has doubled its profits. It is also already the world's most valuable firm with a market capitalisation of $650billion (£428.5 billion). However much of its $178billion cash pile is tied up in tax havens like the Kayman Islands and Ireland which means it doesn't find its way back to shareholders. The stock has gained more than 50 per cent over the last year and rose by five per cent in after-hours trading on Wall Street last night. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: 'Apple has delivered a staggeringly successful quarter, as sales of its flagship iPhone products soared over the period. 'One of the main drivers for the success was the company's increasing exposure to the Chinese market, whilst there were also strong contributions from the likes of Singapore and Brazil.' Cook also confirmed the firm's plan for Apple Watch were on track. 'Development for Apple watch is right on Schedule, and we intend to begin shipping in April,' he said. 'We can't wait for customers to experience it. My expectations are very high, I use it every day, love it and can't live without it.' Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 plus are the key to the huge rise is sales - showing consumers do want big screen handsets. Net income rose 38 per cent to $18billion, as Apple reported earnings of $3.06 a share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting earnings of $2.60 a share on revenue of $67.39 billion. Apple forecast revenue for the current quarter between $52 billion and $55 billion. The midpoint of that range is just below the average analyst estimate of $53.6 billion for the period ending in March, when sales typically fall from their holiday season peak. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said in an interview that revenue for the current period will increase between 14 and 20 percent from a year ago, despite the strong dollar, which has forced other companies to lower their forecasts. 'We feel very good about the March quarter,' Maestri added. Apple has set records with each new version of its iPhones. By comparison, the company sold 51 million smartphones during the holiday quarter in 2013, when its iPhone 5s and 5c models were new on the scene. Bigger screens are one reason for the popularity of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Apple had resisted when other companies such as Samsung began introducing smartphones with bigger screens. But its iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, measured diagonally, while the 6 Plus screen measures 5.5 inches. That compares to a 4-inch screen on iPhone 5 models. Now - although Samsung sells more phones globally - Apple makes more just from the iPhone itself. 'It took Apple a long time to come to grips with the fact that the market did want the bigger screen,' said Gartner tech analyst Van Baker. 'They finally closed the gap on a feature they were missing, which their competition had capitalized on.' The surge in sales of Apple's signature smartphones helped make up for an expected decline in sales of iPad tablets. The company sold 21.4 million iPads, down 22 percent from a year earlier. Sales of Mac computers rose 9 percent, and Apple saw overall revenue gains in all geographic regions. The new models also helped Apple increase its share of the China market. Apple doesn't break out iPhone sales by country, but a report issued Tuesday by research firm Canalys estimates that Apple sold more smartphones in China during the last quarter than any other maker, including South Korea's Samsung and the Chinese companies Huawei and Xiaomi. Still, some experts worry that Apple's strength could become a weakness. Apple makes more money from iPhones than any other product, including its iPods, iPads and Mac computers. The firm is set to unveil its next product, Apple Watch, later this year. That could leave it vulnerable as the overall smartphone market shows signs of slowing growth, warned BGC Partners analyst Colin Gills, who noted in a recent report that Apple depends on iPhones for nearly two-thirds of its revenue. As Apple continues to set records for iPhone sales, that also makes it more difficult to show big increases next year. And it's unclear what will emerge as Apple's next big hit. While Apple plans to start selling its long-awaited smartwatch this spring, analysts say it's difficult to predict consumer demand. Other companies have had limited success with similar gadgets. Apple shares closed Tuesday at $109.14, down 3.5 percent, but rose over 5 percent in after-hours trading on the report. The stock has gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making Apple the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $651 billion.","Tech giant sold 34,000 iPhones an hour during the quarter to December 31 .

"After accusations of ludicrous storylines and legal blunders Broadchurch viewers have accused scriptwriters of their most unrealistic twist yet - table service from Nando's. Disgruntled fans have complained after David Tennant's character DI Alec Hardy  was seen in the latest episode of ITV's crime show, set in Dorset,  ordering chicken from a waiter who appeared beside his table. At the Portuguese fast food chain, customers order their food at the till and pay at the same time. Scroll down for video . Disgruntled viewers have complained that the latest episode of ITV's crime show Broadchurch is unrealistic as it shows table service in fast food restaurant Nando's . Fans have taken to Twitter to complain that the scene with DI Alec Hardy (played by David Tennant) and his family in Nando's was not true to life because a waiter came to take their chicken order . At the Portuguese chicken restaurant customers order their food at the till and pay at the same time. Over the last few weeks the second series of the show has come under fire for its inaccuracies and unrealistic scenes . Over the last few weeks the second series of the show has come under fire for its inaccuracies and unrealistic scenes. The first episode frustrated viewers with its ‘mumbling’ dialogue and the second was littered with legal blunders. Episode three included unrealistic scenes in which a mother appeared in court shortly after giving birth – and her baby appeared to be much older than a newborn. And many turned to Twitter to condemn the show when high-flying black lawyer Sharon Bishop, played by Oscar-nominated Marianne Jean-Baptiste, was portrayed as a single mother. Her son is the only black male character in the show. He is in prison and there is no sign of a father figure in his life. Elsewhere mother Beth Latimer, played by Jodie Whittaker, prompted ridicule when she returned to court to witness the trial of Joe Miller a short time after an easy water birth. But last night fans complained on Twitter that the latest scene with DI Hardy and his family in the fast-food chain Nando's was the most unrealistic to date. 'I can see why everyone complains about #Broadchurch being unrealistic now - table service at Nandos? Whatever next!' said viewer Kate. Character Beth Latimer (Jodie Whittaker) was seen giving birth just hours before giving evidence in court . Seemingly just hours after the birth, Jodie Whittaker and Andrew Buchan as Beth and Mark Latimer were seen in court . Viewers have also pointed out Beth's baby, Lizzie,  looked much too big to be a newborn and could even hold her head up at just 24 hours old . Another fan, Joanne Louise, tweeted: 'Urmmm since when do Nandos do table service? Hahaha.' Paul Phipps-Williams added: 'Is the most unrealistic thing in #Broadchurch table service at Nandos?' Whilst Cian Ginty tweeted: 'Broadchurch even got the ordering in Nandos wrong!' Nando's, which specialises in chicken dishes and is famous for its peri-peri sauce, opened its first UK restaurant in 1992. The first series of Broadchurch premiered in March 2013 and was nominated for seven BAFTA awards. It focused on the death of an 11-year-old boy and the impact of grief and media attention on the town. Most of the cast has returned for the second series. Viewers have previously that during the second series they have had to use subtitles as lead actor David Tenant 'mumbles' and speaks in a strong Scottish accent. Digging up Danny's corpse. What happened: Danny Latimer’s parents Beth and Mark with prosecuting barrister Jocelyn Knight were horrified after Joe Miller’s defence team got Danny’s body exhumed on the flimsiest of grounds and without the prior approval of his family. But retired detective Graham Walker told the Mail on Sunday: ‘The body belongs to the coroner and in these circumstances no coroner would allow an exhumation. You would have to consult the family beforehand. The only reason not to is if the entire family were suspects in the case.’ Use of spy cameras . What happened: Hardy installs a number of hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of DS Miller - where a terrified Claire is finally persuaded to meet her former husband - in the hope of getting a confession from Lee. Hardy installs hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of DS Miller, but any confession obtained through these would be inadmissible in court . But Graham Walker explains: ‘I’m afraid that any confession that is obtained through these means would be totally inadmissible in court. Of course, if you suspect somebody of an offence, you must caution them and tell them they have a right to remain silent.’ The wrong wig . What happened: Sonia Sharma (Meera Syal) is the judge in the case of Joe Miller but the wig she wears is quite different from the short bench wig worn by a judge presiding over a trial in a criminal case. Why Beth would never have been interrogated about her sex life . What happened: The judge allows the defence barrister to question Danny’s mother about her sex life and the affair her husband Mark had with a woman called Becca Fisher, even though it has no obvious connection to the murder. But criminal barrister Maria Dineen explains: ‘The sort of questions that were being asked would not have been allowed. There is no relevance whatsoever.' Could Beth and Mark really select their own criminal barrister? What happened: Danny’s grieving parents choose retired local lawyer Jocelyn Knight as their prosecution barrister. But legal expert Baroness Kennedy says: ‘The whole thing about prosecutions is that they are brought by the state in the name of Queen. Danny’s grieving parents would never have been able to choose their own prosecution barrister in real life . ‘They are brought on behalf of society at large and the victim’s family does not get to choose the barrister.’ Witnesses can't stay to watch trial . What happened: Danny’s parents Beth and Mark, along with the local vicar are among the witnesses for both the prosecution and defence who are all allowed to sit in court and listen to each other as they give evidence. But Maria Dineen says: ‘Witnesses cannot sit through any part of the proceedings, nor can they be told about what is occurring in court at any part. They should never have been in court.’ How come the new suspect turns up everywhere? What happened: Lee Ashworth (James D’Arcy) – who is the prime suspect in the Sandbrook abductions – has displayed an uncanny habit of popping up on the horizon and throwing menacing glances at Hardy. But bemused viewers have wondered exactly how Ashworth has been able to track down Hardy everywhere he goes so easily. Lee Ashworth (James D’Arcy), the prime suspect in the Sandbrook abductions, has displayed an uncanny habit of popping up everywhere . The newborn baby that can hold its head up at 24 hours old . What happened: Those who watched last night's show criticised a storyline in which new mother Beth Latimer, played by Jodie Whittaker, returned to the courtroom just hours after a home water birth. Viewers have pointed out that the baby then looked much too big to be a newborn and could even hold its head up at just 24 hours old. A one in 7,000 occurrence . Fans of the show have pointed out that it would be highly unlikely to see such a diverse courtroom - with a female Asian judge, a black woman defence counsel and a white female prosecution counsel. In 2010, 35% of barristers were women, and 10% were from ethnic minorities. Meanwhile in 2011, 22% of judges were women and 5% were from ethnic minorities. That makes the diversity likelihood of the Broadchurch trial a one in 7,000 occurrence.","Viewers complained after characters ordered chicken dinners from a waiter .

"Photos of the police officer performing a sex act in uniform were leaked and an investigation was launched by senior police bosses . Police in Puerto Rico have suspended a female police officer after photos of her performing a sex act in uniform ended up being leaked to fellow officers. According to a police insider, the images were taken by a male colleague at the police station and were posted onto social media. But not long after, they ended up on the phones of most officers in the country and quickly went viral. When senior police officers heard about it they launched an investigation to find out if the images were genuine, and quickly identified the police officer as being a serving member of the force. They said that the young woman, Cynthia Marrero Pomales, 29, was serving in Carolina, a town in north-eastern Puerto Rico near the capital San Juan. They added that she had been suspended while an investigation was carried out over allegations that she had offended the honour of the police force and damaged its reputation in public. She has reportedly been interviewed and given a statement but no details were given to local media. In one of the pictures the young woman also has the flag of the United States draped over part of her body. She reportedly uploaded the pictures herself on social media although it is understood that she had not intended for them to be shared outside of a small private circle of friends. The superintendent of police in Puerto Rico, Jose Luis Caldero Lopez, confirmed the authenticity of the images and announced that the young policewoman has since been suspended. This is not the first time a sex scandal has disgraced police in Puerto Rico. In 2014, photographs of two cops performing a sex act inside the presidential palace were shared and published, resulting in the officers being expelled from the force.

"Hopes for a new gas boom in Britain were dealt a blow yesterday as MPs voted through a raft of tough regulations on fracking. Labour forced ministers to agree 12 new restrictions on shale drilling last night, which critics say will further hold up the industry for months or even years. David Cameron and George Osborne have called for the UK to go ‘all out for fracking’ as soon as possible, as it could bring down energy bills and create thousands of jobs. But Labour frontbenchers have hardened their opposition to the idea, for fear of losing voters to the Greens. Scroll down for video . Anti-fracking protesters gathered outside Parliament today as MPs voted through a raft of tough regulations on shale drilling . Shadow ministers Caroline Flint and Angela Eagle had vowed to call a halt to extraction of shale gas altogether yesterday unless the government met a series of new standards. Ministers feared that opposition from Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, as well as a number of Conservatives who believe it will be unpopular in their constituencies, could derail the entire operation. The Government last night agreed to a complete ban on fracking in national parks, near water sources and in areas of outstanding natural beauty. More rigorous risk assessments for drilling and controls on the emissions it produces will be enforced, and every resident who will have gas drilling taking place hundreds of feet underneath their homes must be notified in advance. One Lib Dem ministerial aide Tessa Munt, MP for Wells in Somerset where several fracking licences have been granted, had threatened to resign if the bill went through without changes. After the amendments were agreed, the Infrastructure Bill – which will help fracking go ahead - was voted through by MPs by a margin of 324 votes to 231. This headed off the prospect of a complete moratorium on fracking, which was then voted down by 308 votes to just 52, despite the backing of Green MP Caroline Lucas and others. David Cameron and George Osborne, pictured at a cider farm in Somerset yesterday, have called for the UK to go ‘all out for fracking’ as soon as possible, as it could bring down energy bills and create thousands of jobs . Tory MP Tim Yeo, chairman of the Commons energy committee, said some of the regulations were ‘onerous’. ‘I hope there will enough momentum - at least in some parts of the country - to get it going anyway but this will make it more difficult’, he said. Tory MP Tim Yeo said some of the restrictions placed on fracking last night were 'onerous' ‘There has been a lot of emotion and misinformation in this debate and I think when fracking is up and running people will not be opposed to it. ‘Some of the amendments such as notifying people, are sensible, but others are more onerous. We will rely on gas for many years to come, and we may as well use our own rather than other people’s.’ Energy minister Matt Hancock warned last week against too much regulation and accused Labour of ‘putting their political problems ahead of the national interest.’ Britain has vast potential reserves of gas trapped in rocks hundreds of feet underground, which could be extracted by fracking – pumping water and chemicals at high pressure to crack the rocks open. It is already a big industry in the USA where household energy costs have plummeted. The Prime Minister reiterated his support yesterday saying: ‘I want to see unconventional gas properly exploited in our country.’ ‘I think there are good reasons for doing this: we want to have greater energy security, and that should mean making the most of our indigenous energy supplies; we want to keep prices down, I think that’s important; we also want to tackle climate change, and so exploiting some of our own gas rather than shipping it from other parts of the world can make a contribution.’ The Government’s chief scientific adviser Sir Mark Walport also gave his backing, saying shale gas produces fewer emissions than coal and could act as ‘a bridge to a greener future.’ Among those against fracking is Green MP Caroline Lucas, who was arrested at a protest against shale drilling in 2013 . But a Tory source said after the vote: ‘It was between getting this through with cross-party approval or simply having the applications knocked back by councils later. ‘We already have one of the toughest regulatory regimes in the world. These are not huge concessions, and we are happy if they make fracking sustainable and make people feel reassured.’ A government spokesperson said: ‘Shale gas has the potential to support UK energy security, create 64,000 jobs and help the low carbon transition. We have agreed to accept this amendment, to provide clear reassurance in law, and to give this nascent industry has the best possible chance of success.’ Ministers only rejected one of the 13 ‘loopholes’ Labour vowed to close, which would have meant that fracking could only take place at least 1,000 metres underground, as this would halt development. Green campaigners celebrated last night. Donna Hume at Friends of the Earth said: ‘Public opinion and increasing concern from MPs has forced the Government into retreat on fracking.’ Miss Flint said last night: ‘This is a huge U-turn by the Government and big victory for the protection of Britain’s environment. Labour has always said that shale gas extraction cannot go ahead unless there is a system of robust regulation and comprehensive inspection, but David Cameron has repeatedly ignored people’s genuine and legitimate environmental concerns over shale gas.’","MPs voted through a raft of tough regulations on fracking yesterday .

"Outspoken presenter Kirstie Allsopp took to Twitter to publicly shame a car driver who she caught littering . She is best known for giving straight-talking, no nonsense advice to property hunters on her hit TV show. But outspoken presenter Kirstie Allsopp has shown she is not afraid to speak the truth on another issue close to her heart. The star has taken to Twitter to publicly shame a car driver who she caught littering. In a strongly-worded message Allsopp tweeted the number plate of a red car to her 369,000 followers and labelled the driver a ‘to***r’ after witnessing rubbish being dropped on the ground. The term refers to the ‘Don’t be a T****r’ campaign which has previously been used by local councils and Keep Britain Tidy to encourage people to be more responsible when disposing of their waste. Allsopp, 43, who has co-presented the property show for 15 years with 45-year-old Phil Spencer, wrote on Twitter: ‘The driver of this car is a t****r #teachersnott*****s @KeepBritainTidy’ alongside a picture of a red car taken in the dark. The daytime television presenter is known for her hatred of ‘litter bugs’ and is a celebrity ambassador for Keep Britain Tidy. Of the ‘Don’t be a T****r’ campaign, she has previously said: ‘For me it’s a brilliant slogan because it really sums up how terrible it is to chuck stuff out of cars. ‘Occasionally I’ll see someone throwing something out of a car and I’ll take a picture on my telephone and I’ll upload it on to Twitter and then Keep Britain Tidy can contact the DVLA. ‘People say to me “isn’t that a bit extreme, it’s just a bit of litter” but then when you explain to them about the £780m [spent on clearing litter when she spoke about this in 2010] which could be spent on hospitals, or schools or provision of care for the elderly, suddenly they think “oh that’s absolutely true”. Scroll down for video . ‘If each of us chucked a piece of litter out of our car every day we would be knee deep within weeks.’ In recent months Allsopp has also taken to Twitter to shame people who have not cleared up their dog’s mess. In September she took a picture of three full dog poo bags dumped on the ground and captioned the photo: ‘Take it home you stupid, selfish t*****s’ and captioned another similar picture earlier in the year with the message ‘One day I will catch the t****s in my street doing this, it won’t be pretty @KeepBritainTidy.’ The daytime television presenter is known for her hatred of ‘litter bugs’ and is a celebrity ambassador for Keep Britain Tidy . Allsopp, who has two sons with partner Ben Andersen and is step-mother to his two children from a previous relationship, has also backed the use of fines to punish people caught littering. ‘I’m really militant,’ she has said. ‘I’d be in favour of all sorts of things for litter because I think we have to make it clear that we all have a responsibility to our country, to the environment, to safety and health because litter involves all sorts of bigger issues.’ The presenter, who describes herself on Twitter as ‘A working Mum who’s incredibly blessed and occasionally on TV; Re-use, recycle, love, laugh & Keep Britain Tidy’ has also been behind shows such as Kirstie’s Homemade Home and Location, Location, Location.","Star took to Twitter to publicly shame a car driver who she caught littering .

"A couple whose pet ferrets attacked their newborn daughter and chewed off parts of her face have been charged with child endangerment. Burnie Fraim, 42, and Jessica Benales, 24, each face five counts of endangering the welfare of children. Fraim said earlier he did not believe the Darby couple should face criminal charges, according KYW-TV. Skyy Isabelle Fraime was reportedly placed in a car seat and left on the floor of the dining room at the house in Darby Borough, Pennsylvania, on Thursday while her parents went upstairs. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Skyy Isabelle Fraime (pictured with her parents, Burnie Fraime, 42,  and Jessica Benales 24, shortly after her birth) has lost up to 25 per cent of her face after being mauled by three pet ferrets at her Pennsylvania home. The pair each face five counts of endangering the welfare of children . Life-changing injuries: The infant was reportedly attacked by the ferrets while she was sat in a car seat on the floor of the dining room at the Darby Borough-based house on Thursday. Above, Skyy in Facebook pictures . Enclosure:The ferrets escaped out of this cloth-like cage (left), which look like a piece of children's equipment, before running toward Skyy and attacking her . A short time later, the family's three ferrets escaped from their nearby cloth-like cage and ran over to the lone infant. They attacked her, sinking their teeth into 25 per cent of her face. Darby Borough police Chief Robert Smythe told Philly.com: 'The ferrets did chew the infant's nose, top lip and its cheek area. They had eaten that area away. 'I got cops that couldn't sleep last night... You can't imagine what this baby looked like.' Skyy was rushed to hospital with serious wounds. Although she is listed as being in a 'stable' condition, she is receiving assistance breathing in intensive care due to the injuries to her nose. She is also likely to need multiple surgeries in future years to rebuild her face, ABC 6 reported. Speaking to the news station, Skyy's father, Burnie Fraime, who is engaged to the baby's mother, Jessica Benales, said: 'I went over to grab the baby... half her face was messed up from the ferrets.' On Friday, Darby Police Chief Robert Smythe described the girl's injuries - which occurred at around 3.30pm on Thursday - as 'the worst' he has seen in nearly 45 years working for the force. 'I'll be 45 years in June in Darby [with the police department], and this is the worst I've ever seen,' he told the Delaware County Daily Times. 'I thought I'd seen everything. 'This child, the center of [her] face is missing. Her nose was gone, [and so was] part of her cheek and part of her lip. I don't know how much of that got replaced.' He added: 'Just imagine that one-month-old baby, that can't help herself, [and] two or three animals are eating it alive. Imagine the pain.' Scene: Skyy was rushed to hospital with serious wounds. Although she is listed as being in a 'stable' condition, she is receiving assistance breathing in intensive care due to the injuries to her nose. Above, the family home . Father: Mr Fraime, who is engaged to Miss Benales, said: 'I went over to grab the baby... half her face was messed up from the ferrets'.

At the time of the incident, Mr Fraime and Miss Benales were upstairs at their home in the 300 block of Poplar Street, Mr Smythe said. They reportedly rushed downstairs after hearing loud screaming. They found Skyy with serious injuries to her face and called 911. The baby was taken to the Children's Hopsital of Philadelphia, where two stents were immediately inserted into her nose. 'The ferrets ran when the mom came down,' Mr Smythe Said. '[The baby] had emergency surgery. The last I heard she was in stable [condition], but she was in intensive care.' He added that the couple - who have four other young children - are in crisis. They were reportedly clients of Delaware County Child & Youth Services prior to Thursday's tragedy.

"A Chinese zoo has been accused of cruelty after forcing a lion into a tiny cage, tying it down and using an angle grinder to cut off its claws. Staff at the zoo in Zhumadian city in central China's Henan province also admitted that they perform the 'pedicure' without using any  anaesthetics, or consulting a vet. Images show 13-year-old male lion Xiuxiu being tied down with ropes while four staff hold it in place during the procedure. 'Pedicure': Xiuxiu the lion is being tied down in a tiny cage while staff use and angle grinder to trim his claws . The  manager has defended the treatment of Xiuxiu, saying that he was the only large cat out of the zoo's ten  tigers and five lions that undergoes the angle grinder 'pedicure'. Manager Zhao Yanmei said that while the other big cats regularly stretched and sharpen their claws, Xiuxiu spends all his time lying around meaning that his claws quickly grow too long. However, local animal rights activist Yan Yan Liu, 37, has accused the zoo of wanting to save money. She said: 'Only in China it is operation carried out by this, anywhere else in the world the zoo would pay a vet to give the animal an anaesthetic, making sure that it was a stress free procedure. 'And they would use a proper tool to trim the claws, instead of mutilating them with something inappropriate like grinder because they needed to get it done quickly.' 'Quick and painless': Staff at the zoo in Zhumadian city in central China's Henan province perform the angle grinder treatment without using any anaesthetics, or consulting a veterinarian . The zoo however defended its decision to do away with the vets and said the angle grinder treatment is quick and painless. Ms Zhao added: 'We decided years ago not to bother with anaesthetics for any of our lions, tigers or other big cats because we found that it tends to make them feel ill afterwards. 'We do it like this to avoid any side effects.' 'Our way is quick and painless and takes about a minute to do each claw, after which disinfectant is applied.' If a big cat's claws are not trimmed, Ms Zhao said, they grow inwards and cause pain, swelling and infection.","Zoo in China ties lion with rope and trim its claws with angle grinder .

Lithgow mother of two Chloe Patterson, 27, received a string of abusive messages after she left a negative review on a dog-minding Facebook page . Ms Patterson, an apprentice mechanic, said her friend was initially abused after she requested a quote from Mr Cradick. 'I left a review describing his poor customer service. He messaged me back from his personal Facebook to say he had removed the review, before he started harassing me.' In the lewd messages, Mr Cradik said she should get a job at a strip club since and offer 'extra services'. 'By the looks of your profile no wonder you could not afford dog minding with all those kids. What is your problem? Can you not keep your legs shut?' he wrote. ' Also maybe put those pole dancing skills to good use by getting a job at Porky's Night Spot or the Love Machine at Kings Cross. You could make more money by offering extra services to the mean, then you will be able to afford dog minding lol.'

"The heart-warming moment an exhausted koala climbed his way to freedom after being trapped in a mineshaft for days was caught on camera by a number of university students who saved its life. However, the rescue  mission didn't go off without a hitch - the footage shows the animal falling back into the hole after initially climbing out before a second attempt proves successful. A group of outdoor education students from the University of Ballarat in Victoria, found the fatigued animal at the bottom of a five metre mineshaft in the Victorian Goldfields during a trip to the Lal Lal State Forest, The Courier Mail reports. After tossing down some eucalyptus leaves for it to eat, the third year students managed to find a fallen tree to lower into the mine for the koala to cling on to and climb to safety. A group of outdoor education students from the University of Ballarat in Victoria, found the fatigued animal at the bottom of a five metre mineshaft in the Victorian Goldfields . 'The little fella appeared tired and could have been down there for a number of days,' the group wrote on their video caption. Watching eagerly as the tree was lowered down next him, the koala was filmed frantically scrambling up the bark in sheer desperation from the very moment the trunk hit the ground. Appearing dishevelled and somewhat disorientated, the marsupial slowly edged its way up the trunk while the students could be heard shouting out words of encouragement. But one woman's cries of 'we saved him' came far too soon. In a split second, as the grey animal attempted to grasp onto a second tree, its grip faltered and it was sent tumbling down almost seven metres back into the mine. Drop bear: The students managed to find a fallen tree to lower into the mine for the koala to cling on to and climb to safety. However the poor koala was so fatigued that it fell straight back into the mine . Devastated, his saviours could be heard crying out in alarm, with one young man quipping: 'bloody idiot'. But without a moment of hesitation, it was back on all fours making its way up the trunk towards freedom, this time choosing to place his feet firmly on the ground before making its way up a second tree. By this point, the sheer exhaustion from his ordeal was unmistakeable as his back paws struggled to grip onto the bark. It wasn't long, amidst sighs of relief, that the little koala finally rested his backside on a secure tree branch to prevent any further falls. 'We were so relieved that he made it out, then also really excited and proud of what we had accomplished,' One of the students, Luke Parker, told The Courier Mail of their rescue. But without a moment of hesitation, it was back on all fours making its way up the trunk towards freedom, this time choosing to place his feet firmly on the ground before making its way up a second tree .","The Koala was found by a group of outdoor education students from the University of Ballarat .

Disturbing development: Police searching for missing couple Elrey 'Bud' Runion (left) and his wife, June Runion (right), have discovered two bodies near a lake in Georgia . On Tuesday Telfair County Sheriff Sheriff Chris Steverson said the couple died after being shot. The Runions' had been reported missing on Thursday by their daughters after they failed to show up to babysit their grandchildren. Steverson said robbery does appear to be the motive for the couple's killings, but he would not say whether the Runions were carrying cash or disclose other details about the case. On Monday, he said investigators had found no evidence that Towns owned the sort of classic car Runion was seeking. Ronnie Towns, father of Ronnie Adrian 'Jay' Towns, talks the media following his son's arraignment Tuesday . Mother of Ronnie Adrian 'Jay' Towns, Gwen Towns,  leaves the courtroom following her son's arraignment . Residents of McRae, a tiny city about 80 miles southeast of Macon, were stunned, trying to understand what happened to a young man who was known as a 'very smart' and 'good kid.' 'This community feels betrayed,' Steverson said. 'For an individual who was raised in this community to have orchestrated such a heinous act, we are very upset to say the least.' Before Towns had been charged with their deaths, the sheriff had said a cellphone used to make the last known contact with the Runions had been traced to Towns, who turned himself in Monday accompanied by family members.

He grew up on a farm beside a long dirt road where his father grew soybeans, cotton and peanuts. The property isn't far from where the bodies were found. Towns lived in neighboring Wheeler County with his family — a wife and a young daughter whom he supported by doing construction work for a local homebuilder, said his uncle, Buddy Towns.

They're not understanding.' Much remained unknown about what happened to the Runions from the time the couple left home Thursday until authorities found their SUV Monday. The sheriff has said he planned to keep some details of the case under wraps until it goes to court. 'Our hearts really go out to the Runion family,' Buddy Towns said.

"Sometimes it can really feel like the heavens are smiling down on you. That was certainly the case for Ken Butler and his team at Warwick Boat Club who spotted this upside down rainbow during a morning’s rowing on the Avon. ‘We’d just put the boat on the water and were about to set off when we just looked up and noticed it,’ the 65-year-old businessman said yesterday. ‘None of us knew what it was. It was the same colours as a rainbow, but upside down. There was a lot of head scratching as we marvelled at it. ‘The striking thing was it was really high up in the sky and the clarity of the colour was intense and far more distinct than you see in a normal rainbow. Above the arc, the sky was clear blue. Either side there were two columns of cloud and the arc just hung between those columns. ‘It made me think of a rope ladder like you might see across a massive ravine in a film like Raiders of the Lost Ark, but this was a beautiful rope ladder between columns of cloud.’ Marvellous: The upside down rainbow - known as a circumzenithal arc - witnessed by Ken Butler hanging over the river Avon . The dazzling vision witnessed by Mr Butler, who photographed it on his smartphone, is in fact called a circumzenithal arc by scientists. In non-science terms, they only happen way up high and when skies are blue, and when ice crystals are around. Unlike a rainbow, the sky has to be clear of rain and low cloud for them to be seen. Even then, the arc only appears when a low sun shines at a specific angle through a thin veil of cirrus clouds at 20,000-25,000ft. At this altitude clouds are made of ice crystals, the size of grains of salt, which when lined up horizontally refract and deflect the light into an arc mirroring the sun. Mr Butler, of Warwick, photographed this one around 10am last Tuesday, alongside the branches of an ancient oak tree. He and his fellow rowers then completed their 6 mile training trip. ‘When we got back I felt we’d really earned that smile,’ he said. ‘Afterwards I looked up what it was on the internet and discovered sightings are quite rare. ‘This one was very, very clear and all the more impressive as the landing stage is near the walls of Warwick Castle.’ A Met Office spokesman said: ‘Circumzenithal arcs, sometimes known as Bravais’ arcs, are formed when sunlight refracts through horizontal ice crystals at such an angle that the light enters the crystal through its flat top face and exits through a side prism face causing the distinctive upside-down rainbow effect. ‘They are commonly associated with cirrus clouds where ice crystals readily form. ‘Circumzenithal arcs are actually quite common as these types of clouds occur throughout the year, however we only sometimes see them as they are usually obscured by clouds underneath. ‘In order to be able to see a circumzenithal arc, a combination of atmospheric conditions must coincide just right. The height, depth and position of the ice clouds must be right as the cloud needs to be at a specific angle convex to the sun. ‘The position of the observer is also important since its visibility can vary greatly over short distances.’","Ken Butler, a 65-year-old businessman, photographed the dazzling vision as he rowed with friends on the Avon .

"A cat that was run down by a car and written off for dead apparently clawed its way out of the grave and made its way home to be fed. Bart, a pet found on the street in a pool of blood more than a week ago, was pronounced dead by vets in Tampa, Florida. But five days later he was outside owner Ellis Hutson's house again expecting dinner - albeit with a gruesome wound which makes him look the part for a member of the living dead. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Bart, pictured, was pronounced dead, but clawed his way out of the grave and made it to his home in Tampa, Florida . Fighter: Rescuers say Bart probably came to underground and quickly got out - then hid for days before heading home . Hutson told local news station Fox13 that Bart suffered head trauma, a broken jaw and a ruined eye - but was very much alive. Though he still needs surgery before it can be certain he'll pull through, Bart's brush with death saw him escape a muddy grave. It is unclear how he escaped, but Hutson is convinced that the battered feline who made his way to his neighbor's garden - then on home in the hope of a meal - is his revived pet. Bart's eye will never work again - even if the surgery goes right - but his survival instincts are clearly on top form. Rescuers at the Tampa Bay Humane Society, where he is being treated, believed he may have come to underground, escaped and then hid for a few days before gathering the courage to head home.

'Know also that we will cut off your head in the White House and transform America into a Muslim province.' Scroll down for video . Threats: Islamic State militants issued a direct threat at the U.S. president in their latest video . Sickening: The militant warns the Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barazani: 'Every time you launch a missile, we will send you back the head of one of your soldiers' The militant's threats do not stop at America, but also include a message for France and 'sister' Belgium. He says: 'We advise you that we will come to you with car bombs and explosive charges and will cut off your heads'. Earlier this month, jihadist gunmen killed 17 people in a terror attack in Paris. Days later Belgium intelligence services smashed a suspect Islamist plot to kill a police officer or judge. The militant then saves his most personal attack for the Kurdish leader Masoud Barazani, who is currently leading the fight against ISIS in Iraq. 'As for you, oh Masoud (Barazani), you dog, we are going to behead you and throw you into the trash bin of history. 'Know that we are men who fear no-one. We will institute the laws of Allah, may he be exalted and praised.' Gruesome: Memri TV discovered the latest video and translated it from Arabic. The threats do not stop at America, but also include a message for France and 'it's sister' Belgium . Referring to the Kurdish hostage, he continues: 'This is the fate of one of your soldiers, and every time you launch a missile, we will send you back the head of one of your soldiers. 'You are killing children and bombarding civilians while claiming that this is forbidden in your constitution.' The video, which ends with the hostage being beheaded, was discovered by Memri TV which translated it from Arabic. It emerged two days after Kurdish fighters expelled ISIS from the strategic Syrian town of Kobane on the Turkish border after months of fierce fighting. The news prompted celebrations among residents who fled across the frontier into Turkey, with thousands gathering at the border in the hope they will be able to return home more than four months after the fighting first started. The town's recapture marked a key symbolic and strategic blow against ISIS, but officials warned massive reconstruction was needed and the fight would continue for the surrounding villages.","Footage shows masked jihadist standing over kneeling Kurdish soldier .

"A picture has emerged of a bullet hole inside the cabin of a flydubai airliner that was shot at as it came in to land at Baghdad airport, injuring a young girl. The dramatic incident prompted a suspension of flights by UAE carriers to the Iraqi capital. Twitter user Bin Tamim posted a picture on his feed that he claimed was one of the bullet holes caused by the small arms fire. It can clearly be seen between the seat and the armrest. Dangerous: A picture purporting to be of one of the bullet holes caused by small arms fire was uploaded to Twitter to user BinTamin . A bullet hit the fuselage of a flydubai airliner on its descent into Baghdad, injuring two passengers and prompting a suspension of flights by UAE carriers to the Iraqi capital . This picture has yet to be confirmed as authentic. 'There was no consequence other than a slight injury to a young girl. The pilot landed and he was not aware of what had happened,' Transport Minister Baqr Jabr al-Zubaidi told reporters at the airport. Flight FZ215 was hit by 'small arms fire' before landing on Monday but all passengers disembarked safely, a flydubai spokesperson told AFP. An aviation official and a security official told Reuters two passengers were lightly injured when three or four bullets hit the body of flight FZ215  but they were unable to specify the source of the gunfire. The no-frills carrier, a sister firm of Emirates, said it was working with Iraqi authorities to investigate the incident, adding that it will continue to fly to its other destinations in Iraq. Other UAE airlines, including Emirates, Etihad and Air Arabia, suspended their flights to Baghdad. 'Emirates has suspended its services to Baghdad until further notice due to operational reasons,' the Dubai-based airline said. The Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways said it had 'suspended all flights to the Iraqi city with immediate effect and until further notice.' The website of Sharjah-based budget carrier Air Arabia also showed that flights to Baghdad were not available. An aviation official and a security official said two passengers were lightly injured when three or four bullets hit the body of the  flydubai aircraft. Pictured is one of the airline's planes landing at Dubai International airport . Baghdad airport staff confirmed there had been disruption to flights after Monday's incident. 'The plane was able to land normally but some airlines have cancelled or delayed their flights today,' one airport employee said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Flights from some of the other major airlines flying to Baghdad, such as Turkish Airlines and Royal Jordanian, were delayed, their websites showed. 'The exact timing of flights is not yet clear. Operation directors are currently having a meeting,' a Turkish Airlines official told AFP in Ankara. Western airlines flying over Iraq have taken extra precautions in recent months for fear that jihadists of the Islamic State group might acquire weapons able to hit cruising airliners. Baghdad International Airport is located west of the capital, near the province of Anbar, which is largely controlled by IS fighters.","Bullets hit the fuselage of a flydubai airliner on its descent into Baghdad .

"Henry Russell-Wade (pictured) repeatedly raped an Australian woman twice his age, a court heard . An estate agent repeatedly raped an Australian woman twice his age before sending naked pictures of her to friends captioned: 'Lol. Left this cougar wounded,' a court heard. Henry Russell-Wade, 25, picked-up the 50 year-old mother-of-four, who was visiting London, during her first night out in the capital at the Notting Hill Arts Club, a jury was told. Isleworth Crown Court heard they were ejected by security for excessive petting on the dance floor -then returned in the early hours to her short-let flat after the woman rejected Russell-Wade's advances to have sex in the street. The woman, who has been in the same relationship for more than 30 years, told police she had no interest in the defendant when he approached her and two other middle-aged women in the club's smoking area, announcing he was out to: 'Find a cougar.' She told the jury: 'He said he was an estate agent and kept lifting up his shirt to show his six-pack and pierced naval. I was not interested at all, my husband is six foot three and this man was short and skinny. 'I thought it was unusual he would seek out the company of more mature women when there were women there nearer his own age. I told him to seek younger company and pointed somebody out.' Prosecutor Mr. David Smith said the woman visited the club alone on the recommendation of her hairdresser and met the two other women inside for the first time. 'They were approached by this defendant, who was obviously half their age, and found it amusing that this young man was being flirtatious with them. Mr Smith said the defendant 'made it obvious his mind was on one thing and that was to find a cougar for the night' before the pair started kissing on the dance floor. The woman told the jury: 'He came up and started kissing me, which was a surprise to me because I was listening to the music, dancing and had my eyes closed. Isleworth Crown Court heard how Russell-Wade sent naked pictures of the woman to friends captioned: 'Lol. Left this cougar wounded,' a court heard . 'He was forcing his tongue into my mouth, which was unpleasant and I said: 'Be gentle, be gentle.' He pushed me back against a wall. I had nowhere to go. 'I was not in a state to consent to anything and he would be the last man on earth I'd give consent to. I didn't have much chance and he had his tongue in my mouth. 'I'm a married woman with four children and I've never kissed any other man other than my husband.' Mr. Smith told the jury that the defendant 'asked if she would have sex with him in the street' but she said she had a flat nearby. He then helped 'guide her home' and asked to come in, the court heard. Russell-Wade met the woman at the Notting Hill Arts Club (pictured behind the metal railings), in London,  a jury was told . 'She was under no illusion where this was going to lead and anticipated sex would take place, saying her judgement was impaired by alcohol,' Mr Smith said. 'Intercourse began, but she felt sick and asked Mr Russell-Wade to stop, but he carried on and she says she was in great pain.' The woman called police at 2.30pm the following afternoon, added Mr. Smith. 'She was concerned compromising photos had been taken of her in her flat and was concerned they would be distributed on the internet.' However, she was already eight hours too late because the defendant had sent images of her to his friends at 6.30am. 'He was sending photos. Naked ones of her. 'In one she was on her feet and in another beside the bed on the floor and his friends thought it was all highly amusing and replied: 'LOL.' When she called the police the woman told them: 'I'm not claiming I was raped or anything like that.' 'She then opened up and said sex took place without her consent and there was a significant tone of embarrassment in her voice,' said Mr. Smith. The woman was examined at a 'Haven' centre and bruising and marks were found on her collarbones, forearms, shins, knees and back. 'She also found blood on the sheets of her bed.' Police identified Russell-Wade via an image taken of all customers entering the club and when questioned he denied restraining or grabbing the shoulders of the complainant. 'He said they had very rough sex.' Russell-Wade, of Greenford, London has pleaded not guilty to three counts of raping the woman in August at the flat in Bayswater. The trial continues.

"The father of one of the three alleged Russian spies in America was a high ranking FSB intelligence service officer, it emerged today. Igor Sporyshev, 40, is one of two 'espionage ring' members who left America under diplomatic cover. He was a handler of Evgeny Buryakov, 39, who is now detained in New York on suspicion of being part of an intelligence gathering that sought to recruit spies - including female college students - in the US, according to federal prosecutors. Meanwhile it has been revealed the third alleged spy, Victor Podobnyy, who has also left America, was recorded complaining his role was a far cry from the James Bond lifestyle he had imagined. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Evgeny Buryakov, 39, appeared in federal court in New York yesterday after the alleged spy ring was busted. His two co-accused left America under diplomatic cover but Buryakov was not a diplomat . The men, including Igor Sporyshev, allegedly conspired to gather economic intelligence on behalf of Russia, including alleged information about U.S. sanctions against the country, and to recruit New York City residents as intelligence sources, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder (pictured in a file photo) said in a statement . The three were all charged on Monday with conspiring to gather economic intelligence on behalf of Russia, including alleged information about U.S. sanctions against the country, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. Sporyshev was bugged by the FBI and overheard saying that to recruit women 'you either need to f*** them or use other levers to influence them'. In Moscow today it emerged that Sporyshev's father Mikhail, killed in a car crash in 2008, held the rank of Major-General in the FSB secret service, once headed by Vladimir Putin. Sporyshev senior, who died aged 57, worked in the border guard section of the vast Federal Security Service (FSB) structure. It is not uncommon for Russian espionage services to recruit the children of trusted officers. Sporyshev junior and  Podobnyy, 27, have gone to ground since the allegations were revealed on Monday. Evgeny Buryakov, 39, masked this work by posing as a banker for Russia's Vnesheconombank, (pictured) according to the complaint and the bank's website . Podobnyy was also caught on tape by the FBI, complaining about the wide gulf between Hollywood's glamorous version of being a spy, and the reality. 'The fact that I'm sitting with a cookie right now at the …chief enemy spot. F***! ,' he allegedly said in Russian, the New York Post reported. 'Not one point of what I thought then, (unintelligible) not even close. (Unintelligible) movies about James Bond. 'Of course I wouldn't fly helicopters, but pretend to be someone else at a minimum.' Both left the US before charges were filed, it is reported. Russia broke its silence over the charges on Tuesday afternoon, when the foreign ministry dismissed the claims, saying the U.S. had failed to provide any evidence. In a statement demanding Buryakov's release, spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said: 'One gets the impression that the U.S. government has decided to use a favored practice of unleashing passions over espionage.' He added: 'Russian-American ties are going through an extremely complicated period due to Washington's hostilities.' Relations between the two countries are at their worst for some time, with Washington imposing several rounds of sanctions on Russia for annexing the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and backing pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine, targeting Russian financial and energy companies. The FBI Twitter account carried the news on its page on Monday afternoon, announcing they had arrested Buryakov. The other two men had already left the country . State-run news agency Sputnik expressed surprise that evidence against the trio included a phone call by Sporyshev to Buryakov - who is claimed to have worked as a banker to cover his intelligence role - asking for help formulating questions to be asked by an unnamed Russian news agency. Embarrassingly for Moscow, Sporyshev was evidently caught in a bugged phone call talking to his fellow spy on the use of college women as potential spy recruits. 'I have lots of ideas about such girls,' Sporyshev is alleged to have told Podobnyy. 'But these ideas are not actionable because they don't allow you to get close enough. And in order to be close you either need to f*** them or use other levers to influence them. 'So when you tell me about girls, in my experience, it's very rare that something workable will come of it.' Buryakov, who is understood to have worked in Russian Vnesheconombank's Manhattan office, was placed under arrest on Monday. Married, he resided in New York but is believed to have come from Moscow. Wall Street analysts have speculated his focus high-speed Wall Street trading, automated trading algorithms, and 'destabilisation of markets' may have meant he was learning how to trigger a Wall Street meltdown, the Telegraph reported. Igor Sporyshev was officially a Russian trade representative. Undercover: Anna Chapman was one of a large Russian spy ring arrested in New York and New Jersey in 2010 . Infiltrated: Anna Chapman and her fellow spies lived apparently normal American lives. She refused to comment today on the arrest of an alleged member of a new spy ring . Podobnyy was listed in the US as an attache at the Russian mission to the United Nations. Sporyshev and Podobnyy were also charged but will not face justice because unlike Buryakov they were covered by diplomatic immunity. The spy ring is not the first of its kind. In June 2010, Anna Chapman was one of ten Russians arrested in New York and New Jersey after they were identified as being FSB 'sleeper' agents. The group had lived apparently normal American lives, with some of them assuming stolen identities to pass themselves off as American citizens. Chapman had gained her surname by marrying a British man when she lived in London, and lived near Wall Street where she dated a restaurant owner. The agents were supposed to report back on US foreign policy, including towards Russia, and military policy. The arests ended in a prisoner exchange. Today Chapmaned claim it was 'unethical' to comment on the arrest of a suspected Moscow spy in New York. The glamorous undercover operative was herself detained by the FBI in the same city in 2010 before being exchanged in the Cold War-style swap. On the latest spy scandal, she said: 'I have never commented on it. I have never done it in my entire life It is not customary and unethical.' She is now a TV presenter and fashion commentator in Moscow.","Igor Sporyshev is the son of a high ranking Russian intelligence officer .

"Fans of the hit television drama Broadchurch have complained they are finding it harder to understand David Tennant - because his accent has become 'more Scottish'. The actor, who plays dour Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, received wide-spread praise for his performance in the first series of the acclaimed ITV crime show. But a number of viewers have complained that they are finding it increasingly difficult to understand his accent - ever since the second series got underway earlier this month. Scroll down for video . Fans of the hit television drama Broadchurch have complained they are finding it harder to understand David Tennant (pictured as DI Alec Hardy in the second series) Speaking out: Amanda Kerfoot was another to claim that David Tennant's accent was stronger than in the first series . Venting frustration: Fans have taken to Twitter to suggest that the actor's accent has become more Scottish . Some have vented their frustration on Twitter suggesting the Scottish actor is now using a stronger  accent. One Broadchurch fan, Daniel Capwholdi wrote: 'Is it me or has David Tennant become more Scottish?' while CallMeLisa said: 'Speaking of strong accents I had to turn the subtitles on when I was watching Broadchurch because David Tennant is VERY Scottish.' After the critically acclaimed first episode aired on January 5 this year, some baffled viewers accused the actor of 'mumbling' - to such an extent that they were struggling to understand parts of the plot. ITV said at the time that it had received ‘fewer than five’ complaints about mumbled dialogue. Critically acclaimed: David Tennant, who plays dour Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, received wide-spread praise for his performance in the first series of the ITV crime show . CallMeLisa claimed she had to turn subtitles on to help her understand some of the diaogue . It is not the first time Broadchurch has sparked debate on social media with some pointing to inaccuracies in legal proceedings . One of the Twitter users suggesting that this may be the result of a stronger Scottish accent was Anuja P. who wrote: 'Has Tennant gotten more Scottish in the new series of Broadchurch?' But Walaa Mancy was just content to see the actor on screen, tweeting: 'I find it a little bit difficult to understand the Scottish accent, but it's David Tennant, so who cares?' An ITV spokesman this afternoon pointed out that David Tennant was Scottish and merely speaking in his own accent 'as he usually would in every day life' - and denied that it had changed in any way. It is not the first time Broadchurch has sparked debate on social media. This morning, viewers accused scriptwriters of adding in an unrealistic scene - table service from Nando's. Disgruntled viewers have complained that the latest episode of ITV's crime show Broadchurch is unrealistic as it shows table service in fast food restaurant Nando's . Disgruntled fans complained after David Tennant was seen in the latest episode of the show, set in Dorset,  ordering chicken from a waiter who appeared beside his table. At the Portuguese fast food chain, customers order their food at the till and pay at the same time. Others have complained about the plot line, claiming there are a number of inaccuracies in the way legal proceedings have been portrayed . Elsewhere, mother Beth Latimer, played by Jodie Whittaker, prompted ridicule when she returned to court to witness the trial of Joe Miller a short time after an easy water birth. MailOnline has requested a comment from Mr Tennant's representatives this afternoon. Digging up Danny's corpse. What happened: Danny Latimer’s parents Beth and Mark with prosecuting barrister Jocelyn Knight were horrified after Joe Miller’s defence team got Danny’s body exhumed on the flimsiest of grounds and without the prior approval of his family. But retired detective Graham Walker told the Mail on Sunday: ‘The body belongs to the coroner and in these circumstances no coroner would allow an exhumation. You would have to consult the family beforehand. The only reason not to is if the entire family were suspects in the case.’ Use of spy cameras . What happened: Hardy installs a number of hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of DS Miller - where a terrified Claire is finally persuaded to meet her former husband - in the hope of getting a confession from Lee. Hardy installs hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of DS Miller, but any confession obtained through these would be inadmissible in court . But Graham Walker explains: ‘I’m afraid that any confession that is obtained through these means would be totally inadmissible in court. Of course, if you suspect somebody of an offence, you must caution them and tell them they have a right to remain silent.’ The wrong wig . What happened: Sonia Sharma (Meera Syal) is the judge in the case of Joe Miller but the wig she wears is quite different from the short bench wig worn by a judge presiding over a trial in a criminal case. Why Beth would never have been interrogated about her sex life . What happened: The judge allows the defence barrister to question Danny’s mother about her sex life and the affair her husband Mark had with a woman called Becca Fisher, even though it has no obvious connection to the murder. But criminal barrister Maria Dineen explains: ‘The sort of questions that were being asked would not have been allowed. There is no relevance whatsoever.' Could Beth and Mark really select their own criminal barrister? What happened: Danny’s grieving parents choose retired local lawyer Jocelyn Knight as their prosecution barrister. But legal expert Baroness Kennedy says: ‘The whole thing about prosecutions is that they are brought by the state in the name of Queen. Danny’s grieving parents would never have been able to choose their own prosecution barrister in real life . ‘They are brought on behalf of society at large and the victim’s family does not get to choose the barrister.’ Witnesses can't stay to watch trial . What happened: Danny’s parents Beth and Mark, along with the local vicar are among the witnesses for both the prosecution and defence who are all allowed to sit in court and listen to each other as they give evidence. But Maria Dineen says: ‘Witnesses cannot sit through any part of the proceedings, nor can they be told about what is occurring in court at any part. They should never have been in court.’ How come the new suspect turns up everywhere? What happened: Lee Ashworth (James D’Arcy) – who is the prime suspect in the Sandbrook abductions – has displayed an uncanny habit of popping up on the horizon and throwing menacing glances at Hardy. But bemused viewers have wondered exactly how Ashworth has been able to track down Hardy everywhere he goes so easily. Lee Ashworth (James D’Arcy), the prime suspect in the Sandbrook abductions, has displayed an uncanny habit of popping up everywhere . The newborn baby that can hold its head up at 24 hours old . What happened: Those who watched last night's show criticised a storyline in which new mother Beth Latimer, played by Jodie Whittaker, returned to the courtroom just hours after a home water birth. Viewers have pointed out that the baby then looked much too big to be a newborn and could even hold its head up at just 24 hours old. A one in 7,000 occurrence . Fans of the show have pointed out that it would be highly unlikely to see such a diverse courtroom - with a female Asian judge, a black woman defence counsel and a white female prosecution counsel. In 2010, 35% of barristers were women, and 10% were from ethnic minorities. Meanwhile in 2011, 22% of judges were women and 5% were from ethnic minorities. That makes the diversity likelihood of the Broadchurch trial a one in 7,000 occurrence.","David Tennant plays Detective Inspector Alec Hardy in ITV's Broadchurch .

"The sexual abuse of a 13-year-old Boy Scout by an adult volunteer was part of a 'sordid history of child sexual abuse' within the organization that has been documented internally for nearly a century, the victim's attorney said Monday in his opening statement at a civil trial in California. The Scout, now 20, has sued the Boy Scouts of America and a local scouting council for punitive damages after being molested by a volunteer leader in 2007. He claims in his negligence lawsuit that the Scouts failed to educate, train and warn parents and adult volunteers about the dangers of sex abuse. His attorney, Tim Hale, won the right to draw from more than 30 years of 'perversion' files kept by the Scouts as evidence at trial to support those allegations. The files cleared for use by Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge Donna D. Geck include 16 years of documents — from 1991 to 2007— that have never been seen before. Sick: Former Boy Scout leader Al Stein who pleaded no contest to felony child endangerment in 2009. Previously sealed Boy Scouts 'perversion' files spanning 16 years could soon be in the public eye as part of a negligence lawsuit set for trial Monday . Hale told the jury that when they deliberate they will receive a CD of 100,000 pages of files to review and will be the first people in the U.S. outside Scout leadership and attorneys to see the documents. Hale said in his opening remarks that the Scouts recorded between 9,000 and 10,000 such files between 1920 and 2007.  An attorney for the Scouts put the number at 7,500; the discrepancy wasn't explained. 'The Boy Scouts of America has a long and sordid history of child sexual abuse committed against young Scouts . committed by Scout leaders and that timeline goes back, the files show, until at least the 1920s,' he said. 'What has not been going on is notice to the public and notice to (the plaintiff) and his parents,' the lawyer added. The plaintiff in the lawsuit testified later in the day that he suffered a bruise and a laceration in the assault at a Christmas tree lot and still suffers from anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. He returned to the lot with a hidden tape recorder several days later to try to get a confession and was partially successful, he said, when the volunteer asked the teen if he had told his mother. 'It was a 13-year-old's word over a Scout leader, an adult,' said the victim, who remained composed on the stand. 'He was someone people looked up to.' Acknowledgement: The organization acknowledges mistakes in the way sex abuse allegations were handled in the past but now has a robust child protection program, attorney Nicholas Heldt said . The plaintiff later quit his beloved game of baseball, stopped hanging out with friends and stayed in his room. He eventually began home schooling because he saw the volunteer sitting in a car outside his high school about five times as the criminal case proceeded. 'I felt scared. I felt like he was coming after me,' the victim told jurors, adding that he threw up once in public when he unexpectedly saw the man. The victim's name is being used in court, but The Associated Press does not generally name victims of sexual abuse. An attorney for the Boy Scouts said in his opening statement that the 'perversion' files were created to keep children safe by maintaining a master list of people ineligible to volunteer with the Scouts. The organization acknowledges mistakes in the way sex abuse allegations were handled in the past but now has a robust child protection program, attorney Nicholas Heldt said. From 2003 to 2007, a key period for the lawsuit, only 27 adult volunteers were kicked out annually for sexually abusing Scouts, although there were at least 1.5 million volunteers nationally, he said. When the plaintiff was abused, the youth protection training worked because the boy recognized the abuse, resisted and told his mother, Heldt said. She, in turn, told local Scout leaders who informed law enforcement. 'This case is about training and whether training would have made a difference,' he told jurors. 'I think this is a case in which the one instance of sexual abuse against (the plaintiff) could not have been prevented, and it wasn't prevented,' he said. 'But the training program may have helped prevent the second or the third instance of sexual abuse.' The records allowed by the judge could reveal how much the national organization has improved its efforts to protect children and report abuse after several high-profile cases sparked the youth protection policy in the late 1980s. Previous large verdicts against the Scouts focused on cases where alleged abuse occurred before the policy was put in place. In 2012, the Oregon Supreme Court ordered the Scouts to make public a trove of files from 1965 to 1985. The records showed that more than one-third of abuse allegations never were reported to police and that even when authorities were told, little was done most of the time. The current lawsuit alleges that Scouts volunteer Al Stein, now 37, pulled down the plaintiff's pants when he was 13 and fondled him while the two worked in the Christmas tree lot. Stein pleaded no contest to felony child endangerment in 2009 and was sentenced to probation. He served time in prison after authorities discovered photos of naked children on his cellphone. Under the judge's ruling, records that Hale does not use in open court will remain sealed. After trial, the plaintiff's counsel and other interested parties can petition the court for the release of all the files.","A former boy scout filed a lawsuit in California after a troop leader sexually abused him at the age of 13 .

"Pamela Scott's unrelenting headaches left her in agony, and she was actually relieved when doctors diagnosed her with a brain tumour. But the relief was short-lived. The 56-year-old from Morro Bay, California, was soon told removing the tumour would involve invasive surgery that could leave her blind or brain damaged. Unsure if she wanted to take the risk, she began  researching her options online, and found a way of removing the tumour without cutting open the head: accessing the brain through the eyelid. The procedure, performed by a small number of highly specialised surgical teams, involves making a small incision in the crease of the eye. This allows doctors to go past the eyeball and get into the hard-to-reach centre of the head. Pamela Scott was suffering unrelenting headaches, but doctors said the only way to remove the tumour that was causing them was to cut open her skull and get past her brain, risking blindness and brain damage. She found another way to access the tumour: through the eyelid. She is pictured with a 3D model of her skull . Less invasive brain surgery is currently not common, but some surgeons are developing different ways to be able to access tumours, aneurysms and other problems without the trauma of cutting open the head, in the hope that patients will recover faster as a result. Ms Scott was diagnosed with a meningioma - a benign tumor that started in the brain's protective covering and grew into the bone and near her optic nerve – behind her left eye. Reaching this spot - above and behind the eyes, the underside of the brain - is a surgical challenge. Traditional surgery means making a large opening in the skull to give doctors plenty of room to manoeuvre. But they must move painstakingly past sections of healthy brain. Ms Scott was warned that because her tumour was in such a tough location, vision or even cognitive damage was a risk of the top-down surgery. Sometimes, surgeons can snake their tools through the passages in the nose instead, which gives them a straighter shot through a natural opening. Now the eye is offering some paths into this difficult region, too. One location where the surgery is performed is the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Skull Base Surgery. Dr Paul Gardner, director of the centre, said the eye socket is like an ice cream cone, with the tip pointing back towards the brain's centre. Accessing the brain through the eye, known as a 'transorbital' approach, is now being performed by a small number of highly specialised surgical teams. It involves making a small incision in the crease of the eye, allowing doctors to go past the eyeball and get into the hard-to-reach center of the head. They remove a bit of bone about the size of two postage stamps from the inside of the eye socket. Entering the socket at a different angle, doctors also can make a cut in the crow's feet at the corner of the eye. Or they can hide an incision in the eyebrow, making a small hole in the skull just above the eye. It is hoped that patients will recover faster than open surgery, in which doctors cut open the skull and have to get past parts of the brain, risking damage. Entering through the eyelid crease, surgeons can follow that cone to just the right spot to access the brain - removing a bit of bone about the size of two postage stamps from the inside. Entering the socket at a different angle, doctors also can make a cut in the crow's feet at the corner of the eye. Or they can hide an incision in the eyebrow, making a small hole in the skull just above the eye. Dr Robert Harbaugh, president of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, cautioned that accessing the brain through the eye, known as a 'transorbital' approach, hasn't been formally studied. So outcomes such as safety cannot be compared to traditional open surgery, which makes a large opening in the skull. Transorbital approaches are worth exploring, he said. But, 'because it's new doesn't mean it's necessarily better.' Dr Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa, a John Hopkins University neurosurgeon who co-authored one of the first medical journal reports on the eyelid method a few years ago stressed that this type of surgery is only suitable for carefully selected patients. The tumour cannot be too big; no important nerves can be in the way and the person cannot have too large sinuses as this would mean doctors would not have enough room to get to the brain through the eye. He said the operation's main risk is infection, and added that the procedure can only be done by a specialized team with experience in both the eye and the brain. Dr Tonya Stefko, UPMC's director of orbital and oculoplastic surgery, has the job of protecting the eyeball, making the corridor for the neurosurgeons to work. To access tumours in the hard to reach underside of the brain,  doctors can make a small incision in the eyelid, allowing them to go past the eyeball and access the brain behind the eyes. They remove a bit of bone about the size of two postage stamps from the inside of the eye socket . Those kinds of multidisciplinary teams are rare, limiting wider adoption of these techniques, said Dr Quinones-Hinojosa. 'You really have to learn how to be co-captains. Medicine and surgery hasn't been, traditionally, like that,' he said. Pamela Scott believes patients should be informed about alternative options like the eyelid approach – rather than being told open surgery is their only option. She knew medical centers often offer second-opinion consultations for long-distance patients, and started hunting — aided when her husband used a 3D printer to create a life-size model of her skull with her tumor for surgeons to examine. 'The sad thing is that people don't know there are other options than what their small-town doctor is telling them,' she said. 'I feel like a walking miracle.' She had to travel 2,580 miles from her home in California to Pittsburgh for the procedure. But after having the operation, she awoke with essentially a black eye, and was back at work in her psychotherapy practice in two weeks, wearing sunglasses. Doctors warn the surgery, known as transoptical surgery, is not suitable for everyone and should be carried out by specialist teams of brain and eye specialists . In Indianapolis, dentist Deborah Boyer underwent a similar months-long search to treat a meningioma growing around critical nerves and blood vessels, threatening her vision and motor function. She wanted both a brain and an eye specialist. So she read medical journals online and hunted designated 'centers of excellence.' Dr Gardner initially planned to cut through the side of her skull, a smaller operation than other doctors offered, but later decided the corner of her eye offered a good path. Ms Boyer said it took twice as long as regular surgery, but she was discharged in four days pain-free. 'People need help to try to get connected more quickly, and to know what those options are,' she said.","Pamela Scott, 56, had a brain tumour which caused unrelenting headaches .

NSW: Eastwood, Glebe, Manly, Marrickville, Newtown, Oran Park, Penrith, Ryde, Surry Hills, Sydney . VIC: Essendon, Glen Iris, Ringwood . QLD: Brisbane, Gold Coast, Toowoomba, West End . WA: Baldivis, Belmont, Bentley, Kelmscott, Mandurah, Perth, Subiaco . SA: Mile End, Norwood, Parkside . The inner Sydney city suburbs of Glebe, Newtown, Surry Hills, Sydney and Marrickville made the top 28 list for NSW along with Eastwood, Manly and Ryde in the city's north and Oran Park and Penrith in western Sydney. In Queensland, aside from Brisbane and the Gold Coast, the key areas of New Farm, Toowoomba and West End were forecast to see above average price growth. Esendon, Glen Iris and Ringwood were listed among those in Victoria, while Norwood, Parkside and Mile End topped the list in South Australia. Western Australia's central suburbs were also the focus of price growth predictions, with the suburbs of Belmont, Perth, Bentley and Subiaco named as well as Mandurah, Baldivis and Kelmscott just south of the capital. But it's Brisbane that is expected to take the limelight from Sydney in 2015, with a predicted 5.7 per cent capital growth in house prices compared to Sydney's 4.1 per cent, Melbourne's 2.7 per cent, Adelaide's 2.1 per cent and Perth's 1.8 per cent.

This property at New Farm in Queensland is on the market for $929,000. New Farm topped NAB's list of suburbs . Homes in Perth (pictured) are predicted to see 1.8 percent capital growth in house prices . In 2016, growth is expected to slow substantially as the 'housing market looses steam', according to NAB's report (pictured: Surry Hills) The report predicts that house price growth (like this property in Sydney's Surry Hills) will continue to moderate because of rising unemployment, sluggish household income growth, affordability concerns, cost of living pressures and high levels of household debt . In 2016, growth is expected to slow substantially as the 'housing market looses steam', but Brisbane will still take the lead at 3.8 per cent, followed by Sydney and Melbourne at an equal 2.3 per cent. 'With more signs emerging that the residential housing market is loosing steam, NAB Economics expects average capital city house prices to cool to around four per cent over the year to end-2015 and two per cent over the year to end-2016,' the report stated. 'Our assessment of the market remains that house price growth will continue to moderate because of rising unemployment, sluggish household income growth, affordability concerns, cost of living pressures and high levels of household debt. 'We are also forecasting two further interest rates cuts of 25 bps in March and 25 bps in August 2015 (bringing the official cash rate down to two per cent) which should support house prices a little more than previously expected.' Foreign buyers in the new property market were less active in all states except for Victoria where they accounted for one in three of all sales (pictured: Essendon, Victoria) The Gold Coast, which is the location of this stunning home worth $3.7 million, is one of the Queensland suburbs predicted to enjoy above average capital growth .

Areas, like this home in Newtown, Sydney were selected by more than 300 panellists including real estate agents and property developers . The NAB report highlighted that housing affordability, construction costs and a lack of development sites were seen as the biggest constraints in new housing market, while employment security and price levels were the biggest weakness to buying an established property. Foreign buyers in the new property market were less active in all states except for Victoria where they accounted for one in three of all sales, according to the report. About 53 percent of foreign purchases were for apartments, 31 percent for houses and 16 percent for re-development.","The list of 28 suburbs were released in NAB's latest Residential Property Survey .

"President Barack Obama has left India for Saudi Arabia without inking a climate deal that formed much of the basis for his second trip to the subcontinent. The Hindustan Times reported on Tuesday that India has refused to embrace the idea of a 'peaking year' for greenhouse gas emissions – a designated year after which emissions levels would have to start decreasing. China agreed to that sort of framework last year, but Indian officials now see being lumped in with Beijing as a negative thing. India is the world's fourth-biggest carbon emitter. China is number one. 'Having a peaking year was not acceptable to us,' an Indian environment ministry official told the Times. Obama visited India on Air Force One, a plane that burns five gallons of jet fuel for every mile it flies. His round-trip, including a stop in Saudi Arabia, will emit 809 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere . 'Few countries will be more affected by a warmer planet than India': Obama told 1,500 young people that he was trying to fix the planet for their generation, but left India empty-handed . Is it warm out here or is it just me? India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi (left) and US President Barack Obama (right) couldn't iron out their global-warming differences in New Delhi . The U.S. president spared no rhetorical expense on Tuesday morning in New Delhi, telling an audience of 1,500 youths that America would 'continue to help India deal with the impacts of climate change, because you shouldn't have to bear that burden alone.' But that promise, it seems, applies chiefly if India follows Obama's lead, something it won't do. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is brushing off Obama's demands, instead maintaining that it will reduce CO2 levels as a percentage of its economic output – not in hard measurements of greenhouse gases. India also says it will quintuple its solar energy capacity and boost its wind energy capacity 30-fold by 2022. But a China-like agreement is off the table. In late 2014 Obama reached a deal with Beijing that committed the United States to a cut in greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26 per cent, by the year 2025. China promised its emissions would peak in 3030, but made no commitments with hard numbers attached. Republicans in Congress complained bitterly, including Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, who now chairs the Committee on the Environment and Public Works. 'A promise to peak its carbon emissions only allows the world’s largest economy to buy time,' he said then. So it's unlikely that even a firm deal with India would have brought Obama universal accolades. Obama, though, strutted with his best climate talk during his speech at the Siri Fort Auditorium, an event that was marred by tech glitches in the video feed back to the United States. 'With rising seas, melting Himalayan glaciers, more unpredictable monsoons, cyclones getting stronger, few countries will be more affected by a warmer planet than India,' he said. But Obama also acknowledged a whiff of hypocrisy in asking India to foreswear fossil fuels just as its economy is breaking away from Third World status. 'I know the argument made by some, that it's unfair for countries like the United States to ask developing nations and emerging economies like India to reduce your dependence on the same fossil fuels that helped power our growth for more than a century,' he said. 'But here's the truth: Even if countries like the United States curb our emissions, if countries that are growing rapidly like India, with soaring energy needs, don't also embrace cleaner fuels, then we don't stand a chance against climate change.' Modi and his government, for now at least, lack his sense of urgency. But the U.S. has held a carrot over his head, offering a $1 billion fund to help the country develop green energy if it complies. A'WARMING WE SHALL GO: Air Force One burns 5 gallons of jet fuel per mile, and each gallon puts 2.1 pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere – bringing carbon footprint of Obama's plane to 809 TONS during the trip . Gas-guzzling beast: Obama's bullet-proof Cadillac limousine rides in the belly of Air Force One wherever he goes . The idea of climate change as a man-made source of global warming is as controversial and polarizing as ever. NASA made global news this month when it got egg on its face after claiming 2014 was the hottest year on record. Its own data, however, showed there was only about a one-third probability that was true. In contrast, other scientists point to temperature measurements that indicate the planet hasn't warmed, on balance, for the last 17 years  even as emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases have dramatically increased. Yesterday the hgh temperature in New Delhi was 64 degrees Fahrenheit, a bit below the historical January averageof 68. The Natural Resources Defense Council, a moneyed U.S. environmental activist group, told the Associated Press that Obama didn't walk away completely empty-handed. 'This was a strengthening of the partnership on all levels, with climate at the heart,' said Anjali Jaiswal, who runs the group's India Initiative program. 'This is a whole new level of engagement that we're seeing from India.' The NRDC did not respond to a request for comment after that engagement failed.","India refused to agree to a 'peaking year' after which its carbon dioxide emissions would begin to decline .

"Britain is in 'poll position' to be the best performing major economy in the world after securing growth of 2.6 per cent in 2014, new figures showed today. It is the highest level of annual growth since before the financial crash, which David Cameron said was proof that the government's economic plan is working. But the data showed the pace of expansion slowed more sharply than expected in the last three months of the year. The British economy is now 3.4 per cent bigger than the pre-recession peak at the start of 2008, according to the ONS . The annual figure for the whole of 2014 is the best since 2007, before the recession. It puts the UK on course to have been the world's fastest growing major economy last year. But gross domestic product (GDP) rose by just 0.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, the weakest level in a year, weighed down by a construction sector which shrunk at its worst pace for more than two years. The growth figure for 2014 was widely expected, though falls short of the 3 per cent forecast last month by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). It beats 2013's figure of 1.7 per cent and matches the 2.6 per cent recorded in 2007. US growth figures are due to be published on Friday. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates its growth at 2.4 per cent. The British economy is now 3.4 per cent bigger than the pre-recession peak at the start of 2008, according to the ONS. Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander said: 'Quarterly growth of 0.5 per cent puts the UK in poll position to be the fastest growing G7 economy in 2014. 'There is much more to do, but this figure represents solid progress, especially against a backdrop that sees many of our key markets still suffering from economic problems.' Britain's economy grew by 2.6 per cent in 2014, the highest level of annual growth since before the financial crash . Chancellor George Osborne said: 'Today's figures confirm that the recovery is on track and our plan is protecting Britain from the economic storm, with the fastest growth of any major economy in 2014. 'But the international climate is getting worse, and with 100 days to go until the election now is not the time to abandon that plan and return Britain to economic chaos.' Speaking before the figures were released, Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Our economy is growing, we have created 1,000 jobs for every day we have been in office, our growth is one of the strongest in any western economy, and we have made good progress. 'We are working to a long term economic plan that is working. 'But there are flashing lights on the dashboard and one of them is the Eurozone which hasn't been growing and obviously it's a very big market for Britain's exporters and obviously we are not immune from it.' Growth of 0.5 per cent in the last three months of 2014 is the lowest since the same period in 2013. Economists had expected it to be at 0.6 per cent. It makes it more likely that a rise interest rates will be further delayed,amid ultra-low inflation. Growth was dragged down by construction, which contracted by 1.8 per cent - its worst slowdown since the second quarter of 2012. Manufacturing grew by just 0.1 per cent, its worst performance since the start of 2013. The wider production sector shrank by 0.1 per cent. The dominant services sector, which represents more than three quarters of output, grew by 0.8 per cent. Services are now 7.9 per cent ahead of their pre-downturn level at the start of 2008 but manufacturing remains 5.4 per cent behind while construction is lagging by 7.9 per cent . Services are now 7.9 per cent ahead of their pre-downturn level at the start of 2008 but manufacturing remains 5.4 per cent behind while construction is lagging by 7.9 per cent. Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: 'Tory claims that the economy is fixed will ring hollow with working people who are still not feeling the recovery. Wages are down by £1600 a year since 2010 and now these figures show a concerning slowdown in economic growth too. 'Construction is down again, business investment under this government is lagging behind our competitors and exports are way off target. And the stagnating wages we have seen over the last five years are the reason why the Chancellor has broken his promise to balance the books.' Joe Grice, Chief Economist at the Office for National Statistics said: 'This is the second consecutive quarter in which the growth rate has fallen but it is too early to say if there is a general slowing-down of the economy. 'The dominant services sector remains buoyant while the contraction has taken place in industries like construction, mining and energy supply, which can be erratic. ' Samuel Tombs of consultancy Capital Economics said the sharp fall in the oil price, expected to provide a boost in spending, should help the UK 'regain some vigour in early 2015' following the slowdown. He added that the figures showed 'that the recovery has narrowed to become almost entirely dependent on growth in services sector output' with industrial production and construction down. 'Nonetheless, with the recent halving of oil prices providing a timely boost to households' discretionary spending power, credit still becoming cheaper and pay growth on an improving trend, we think that GDP growth could pick up to 3 per cent this year. 'In short, the best days of the UK's recovery may still lie ahead.'","UK economy grows by 2.6% in 2014, among the fastest in the world .

"When GoDaddy revealed last year that its 2015 Super Bowl ad would be starring a nine-week-old puppy named Buddy, viewers could never have anticipated the cruel twist it would take. The domain name company released the advert on Tuesday - five days before it will be viewed by more than 100 million people during the Patriots and Seahawks game - and it was met with outrage. The advert opens with the golden retriever puppy  riding in the back of a truck, as it parodies Budweiser's commercials featuring a dog and its Clydesdale horses. But instead of enjoying the view, Buddy is thrown from the bed of the truck and he faces a treacherous journey home across train tracks and bridges and through mud and rain. Don't be fooled: GoDaddy's 2015 Super Bowl advert, which was revealed on Tuesday, opens with Buddy the puppy looking out from the bed of a truck - but it soon takes a dark turn . Plot twist: The truck hits a rock and the golden retriever puppy is thrown from the back of the truck . Finally, he sees his owners' farm and runs towards them, as they open their arms in joy. But it's no happy ending: the only reason they're glad to seem him is because they've sold him on a website they set up with the help of GoDaddy. The pup is promptly put in a van and driven away by GoDaddy spokesperson Danica Patrick. When the advert was revealed on the Today show on Tuesday morning, the hosts were shocked. 'Me no likey,' Natalie Morales said as her co-hosts sat in silence. Savannah Gurthie added: 'I don't know how people are going to feel about that.' 'Oh, I know how they're going to feel about it,' Matt Lauer said. Viewers of the video have responded with shock and disgust. On track: Buddy, who was nine-weeks-old when they shot the commercial, tries to find his way home . Treacherous: In other scenes, he cowers in the cold as he tries to get back to his family's farm . 'Poking fun at a puppy mill is not a laughing matter,' wrote Mick Magnuson. 'And I hope they get bombarded with calls and emails letting them know how disgusting the commercial is.' 'What kind of monster do they have running their marketing department? #GoDaddyPuppy Tasteless, horrid, shameful,' Kate Thomas tweeted. Some customers even messaged the domain service to say they would no longer be registering websites with them again. But some saw the funny side. 'My first thought was, this isn't funny, but it got so weird I couldn't not laugh! Funny commercial,' Darren McPhee wrote on Twitter. Last year, GoDaddy's commercial featured a woman who quit her job so she could work as a puppeteer full time.

"The man known to millions as Neighbours star Harold Bishop has landed himself a new role – teaching sex education. Actor Ian Smith has been unveiled as the face of a new video series to support teachers delivering health and sexual wellness education in schools after La Trobe University discovered just 59 per cent of teens in Australia reported using condoms when they last had sex. The 76-year-old plays a grandfather in the series called 'Ask Grandad', in which he teaches young people how to put on a condom. In an interview with KIIS 101.1's Matt Tilley and Jane Hall, the Aussie TV legend joked: '55 years in the business and here I am teaching sex education.' Actor Ian Smith has been unveiled as the face of a new sex education video (pictured) He plays a granddad who offers advice on how to use condoms in the video . Smith explained that he was inspired to help because he never received proper sex education himself. 'It is one of my youngest memories, I asked my grandfather... and him telling me a few things about life which my parents never ever did,' Smith said. 'I remember my sex education from my father, I had just gone to bed and was reading a book when he walked in and gruffly sort of threw a soft cover book on the bed called Know Your Body and that was it,' the actor added. Smith, who joined Neighbours as Harold Bishop in 1987 - when Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan were still in the cast - and fell in love with Madge Ramsay who was played by Anne Charleston, admitted that he got 'slightly embarrassed' while filming with condoms. Ian Smith joined Neighbours as Harold Bishop in 1987 and has run the show's coffee shop and general store . Smith will return to Ramsay Street for the show's 30th anniversary episode . 'But I thought why am I embarrassed? Do you want kids to grow up like you did?,' he told KISS 101.1. The Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Victoria, teamed up with Ansell Healthcare to produce the Ask Grandad DVD and teaching kit. Pamela Blackman, who is a researcher at La Trobe and a former secondary school teacher, said the resource was trialled in three schools last year and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. 'This is such a great way to stimulate discussion about safe sex – not just between teachers and their students but also between parents and their kids– and that is so important given we know about 50 per cent of young people are sexually active by year 12,' Ms Blackman said. 'Because so many of us find sex a very personal thing, teachers, students and parents often find discussing condoms awkward. However, the humour in the Ask Grandad resource alleviates much of the embarrassment.' Smith will also soon star in Neighbours' 30th birthday episode with his deceased on-screen wife Madge set to make a return, possibly as a ghost.

"The newest player in the ongoing Deflate-gate saga doesn't wear a helmet when he goes to work. According to a new report, the NFL has focused its investigation on a Patriots locker room attendant caught shuttling balls from the official's locker room to another room in Gillette Stadium surveillance footage before they made it to the field. The report from Fox Sports reveals that league authorities have interviewed the attendant at least twice as part of their continued investigation that has Patriots, Colts and NFL fans in general anxiously waiting to learn why 11 of 12 balls were under-inflated during the New England victory over Indianapolis that clinched a Super Bowl berth. The revelation may not come as a surprise to anyone who heard Patriots quarterback Tom Brady defending his team in a press conference last week. Scroll down for video .

Along with his outright denial of any involvement, Brady's statement could easily be seen as a shifting of focus to who he calls 'equipment guys. He said: . 'I have a process before every game where I take the footballs I want to use for the game. Our equipment guys do a great job breaking the balls in for the game. Our equipment guys have a process they go through.' The Patriots escaped a winter blizzard to make their way to the Super Bowl city of Phoenix on Monday but there was no avoiding another storm as the mystery of the deflated footballs continued to swirl. As snow blanketed the U.S. Northeast the Patriots stepped off their flight into the teeth of a full blown controversy as hundreds of media welcomed them with questions about an NFL investigation. For over a week the Patriots have been hammered by questions about how 11 of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game did not meet NFL standards. Denied deflating balls: Patriots quarterback Tom Brady denied having a hand in the ball deflation while not-so-subtly shifting focus to who he called 'equipment guys.' 'Our equipment guys do a great job breaking the balls in for the game,' he said at a press conference last week . On Monday the team blasted back, with team owner Robert Kraft sent out to take on the media. Defiant and confrontational, a grim-faced Kraft opened the Patriots first Super Bowl news conference with a scathing rebuke of the media and the league for questioning his team's integrity and that of coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. Both Brady, a three-time Super Bowl winner, and Belichick have denied any knowledge or involvement in what has become known in the American media as 'Deflategate'. 'I want to make it clear that I believe unconditionally that the New England Patriots have done nothing inappropriate in this process or in violation of NFL rules,' Kraft told a packed conference hall. 'Tom, Bill and I have been together for 15 years, they are my guys, they are part of my family ... and I have never known them to lie to me. 'It bothers me greatly that their reputations and integrity and by association that of our team has been called into question this past week.' New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft reads a statement during a news conference Monday in Chandler, Arizona. The owner said he expects to soon get an apology from the NFL . Kraft said that once the NFL's investigation, being led by Ted Wells and which is expected to last several more weeks, is completed that he will expect an apology from the NFL. 'If the Wells investigation is not able to definitively determine that our organization tampered with the air pressure in the footballs I would expect and hope that the league would apologize to our entire team and in particular coach Bill Belichick and Tom Brady for what they have had to endure this past week,' said the Patriots billionaire owner. 'I am disappointed in how this entire matter has been handled and reported upon. 'We expect hard facts as opposed to circumstantial leaked evidence to drive the conclusion of this investigation.' While Kraft met the controversy head on, Belichick had a different game plan, simply refusing to answer any questions on the subject. Belichick, who was fined the league maximum of $500,000 in 2007 for videotaping an opponent's defensive signals, followed Kraft to the podium and said his only focus was on Sunday's Super Bowl foes Seattle. 'My attention is totally turned now and focused on the Seattle Seahawks and our game Sunday and that is where it is going to stay for this week,' said Belichick. 'This week it is all about Seattle.' New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick has also forcefully denied any wrongdoing on the part of his team .","NFL insiders revealed Monday that league authorities have now interviewed the Gillette Stadium attendant more than once .

"Controversial media personality Derryn Hinch has posted a video slamming celebrities participating in the 'I Stand For Mercy' campaign as 'hypocritical' and declaring his support for the death penalty in Australia. In a video labelled 'Derryn Hinch on Bali Nine Executions', the radio and television presenter expressed no sympathy when bluntly stating that Bali Nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan 'ran the risk' when they attempted to smuggle heroin out of Indonesia ten years ago. 'People like Alan Jones, Germaine Greer, Asher Keddie, David Wenham, they’ve all lined up and they’ve all signed up, and I think it’s hypocritical,' Hinch says in the video. Scroll down for video . Derryn Hinch has slammed the Australian celebrities who participated in a video to help save Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan from facing the firing squad after attempting to smuggle heroin a decade ago . Australian media personalities, including Asher Keddie and her artist husband, Vincent Fantauzzo,  joined the campaign initiated by artist Ben Quilty to request mercy from Indonesian authorities . Megan Washington (above), and Andrew Denton are among those who have come forward to take part in the I Stand For Mercy video . Never been one to hold back on his views, Hinch says in his video, posted on his website, Human Headline, that the Australian pair were fully aware of the ramifications if caught drug smuggling in Indonesia. 'It’s the same in China, in Malaysia, in Thailand, in Vietnam, that’s the risk you run,' he said bluntly. Hinch went on to question the well-known Australian personalities' stance on the death penalty - asking whether the only sought mercy for their own countrymen. 'Did they stand up a week ago and say I stand for mercy for the Brazilian who was executed in Indonesia or the one from the Netherlands or the Indonesian woman or somebody from Malawi?' he asked. 'Are you against the death penalty for the terrorists?' he added in his rant. He then expressed his support for the death penalty and believes that most Australians would stand right there alongside him. 'I support the death penalty for some crimes…but in cases of rapists, child murderers, people who kill policemen, people who kill prison guards, and terrorists, the death penalty should stand. 'We should have the death penalty in Australia. If we had a referendum, if Tony Abbott had the guts to do it, 75 per cent of Australians would agree with me.' Bryan Brown joins other Australian media personalities in showing support for Chan and Sukumaran . Australian war artist Ben Quilty is the person behind the campaign requesting mercy from Indonesian authorities and has produced a star-studded video called I Stand For Mercy. The video contains a number of contributions from famous Australians saying how upset they are and that the men’s lives should be spared. It features the likes of actors Asher Keddie, Bryan Brown and Claudia Karvan, musicians Missy Higgins and Megan Washington, and broadcasters Alan Jones and Andrew Denton. Chan and Sukumaran face death by firing squad as early as next Sunday for attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia, and their clemency bids have been ignored. Quilty became a mentor and close friend of Sukumaran after he was jailed, and has used his creative talents to create the powerful video in support of the two men. 'The message is just for the boys to know there are people walking with them in this very dark time,' Quilty told news.com.au. Richard Roxborough has also joined the I Stand For Mercy Campaign . The 41-year-old is trying to organise a candlelight vigil for the pair, to 'send a strong message to the men themselves and their families that there are a lot of prominent Australians in the arts, media and all parts of our community who are on their side.' 'I want the barristers to walk into that prison and tell the boys how many people are thinking of them and supporting them,' he said. The 41-year-old has recruited dozens of renowned musicians to ‘perform for clemency’ and send a message that the death penalty is unacceptable. “It’s for Myu and Andrew - I’d do anything for those two boys,” he said. 'I want to send a strong message to the men themselves and their families that there are a lot of prominent Australians in the arts, media and all parts of our community who are on their side.' Andrew Hansen and Craig Reucassel from The Chaser show their backing . Chan and Sukumaran (above) are scheduled for execution in 2015 and could face a firing squad next Sunday . Co-founder of the Mercy Campaign, Brigid Delaney said the video highlighted the support for the two men on death row. 'It's amazing how much support the petition asking for clemency has received. We have more than 50,000 signatures, with thousands being added each day as the message of mercy spreads,' she said. 'This video is part of that campaign, respectfully asking the Indonesian government for mercy for Myuran and Andrew.' A concert is also planned in Sydney on Thursday in support of the Mercy Campaign. Details on the event are still being finalised. Chan and fellow inmate Myuran Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006 . The families of Bali Nine ringleaders Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, have made a desperate plea to Indonesia's president to reconsider the pair's executions in light of the work they have done to improve the lives of fellow inmates. On Thursday, Chan's last ditch attempt at a clemency bid was rejected by President Widodo, following Sukumaran's rejected bid in December, officially exhausting the  legal appeals against their death sentence for attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia. The relatives of Chan and Sukumaran said they were devastated to hear the decision about the clemency bids, and pleaded for the president to visit the pair in Kerobokan Jail.","Celebrities from the showbiz world are joining the fight for clemency to be shown to Bali Nine pair Myarun Sukumaran and Andrew Chan .

"As if there weren't enough cat photos on Facebook, a new app could be about to flood feeds with even more feline images. Secure chat service Wickr has launched a tool that allows private images to appear as cat pictures to those Facebook friends you'd rather keep in the dark. The new free self-destructing feature, dubbed Wickr Timed Feed (WTF), lets users share photos within a Wickr feed. Secure chat service Wickr has launched a tool that allows private images to appear as cat pictures to those Facebook friends you'd rather keep in the dark. The new self-destructing photo feature, dubbed Wickr Timed Feed (WTF), lets users share photos within a Wickr feed (left) They can also share these with their friends on Facebook – but only with up to 151 people for 24 hours. Everybody else who is not on the 'secure list' will instead see a picture of a cat in their feed. Meanwhile, friends on Wickr can look through the users Facebook feed and click on the photos to see the private post. Even Facebook servers never see the real shared pictures, offering no opportunity to save copies, target ads or collect data, claims founder Nico Seller. Wickr has been downloaded more than five million times in 196 countries since the start-up launched in 2012, according to Sell. Even Facebook servers never see the real shared pictures, offering no opportunity to save copies, target ads or collect data, said founder Nico Seller . The ultra-private messaging application lets people share messages or pictures that are encrypted in a way that doesn't even let Wickr see them. People also set how long they want messages to last before self-destructing. To use WTF, a user logs into Wickr, click the WTF tab, and can then take a photo or select an existing one. The next step is to choose up to 151 friends to share it with. Those friends can view the photo within their Wickr feed before the are removed after 24 hours. Users can also share the photo on Facebook. At first, the photo appears as a cat picture to every Facebook user. But users, who have been pre-apporved, can double click on the photo and be redirected to Wickr to see the real image. Versions of the application have been released for Android and Apple mobile devices as well as for computers powered by Macintosh, Windows or Linux software. WTF was added to the free Wickr application made for Apple devices. 'We are taking a very complex spy tool, adding a joke and making it something my kids are going to use a hundred times a day,' Ms Sell said. Wickr lets people post pictures at leading social network Facebook but, in a twist, uses an old-time spy technique called 'steganography.' Ms Sell describes steganography as the art of hiding messages in plain sight. When Wickr pictures are posted to Facebook, what appears at the social network are adorable kitten photos instead of the personal images being shared. WTF was inspired by Ms Sell's eldest daughter. The teenager wanted to connect with friends on Facebook but met resistance from her mum, who has been a long-time organiser of the infamous Def Con hacker gathering that takes place annually in Las Vegas.

For now, kitten pictures will serve as the inside Wickr joke. Worries about snooping by criminals, spies or governments have fueled interest in Wickr, according to Sell.

"An inspirational Chinese woman who refused prosthetic limbs after losing her feet in a childhood accident now walks miles to work everyday- on her knees. Every morning, Hu Fenglian, wraps her stumps with cloth before adding a pair of rubber 'shoes' made out of old bus tires. She then shuffles for miles on her knees to get from her home deep in the mountains of southern China's Guangxi Province, to her job in the local village's lumberyard- earning her the local nickname of 'Sister Strong-Will'. Hu Fenglian, pictured walking along the street in Guangxi Province, China, has learnt to walk on her knees after a childhood accident left her with no feet and shortened legs . Hu was just six months old when she was severely injured after falling into a home heating stove leaving her with no feet and only partial lower legs. She was offered the chance of a pair of prosthetic legs but said she found them too uncomfortable. 'After wearing them, my legs would swell, painful and inflammable. I had to quit them,' she explained. Then tragedy struck again in 1982, when her husband abandoned her and the family, leaving her to support their four-month-old baby. When Hu was only 6 months old, she had accidentally fallen into a home heating stove and severely injured her lower legs . But the 50-year-old refuses to let her disability stop her and is even able to work in a lumber factory (pictured) Hu Fenglian's home is deep in the hills and the bus can only deliver her to the entrance of the mountain so she had to walk on her knees the rest of the way (pictured) Despite losing so much, Hu said she wasn't angry or bitter, only grateful she survived the accident. 'I never feel the life is unfair to me,' she said. Refusing to let it hold her back, she added she had never dreamed of begging. Instead the incredible mother took every job she could- from plowing the fields to even working down a mine between 2006 and 2010- all while walking on her knees. 'I have no feet, but I have hands and I have strength. I can support myself,' said the 50-year-old. Her incredible spirit and determination has seen her nicknamed 'Sister Strong-Will' in her hometown of Jiangdi, in southern China's Guangxi Province . She said she would never dream of begging but was proud to be able to support herself and buy her own food (pictured) Incredibly, for around four years, between 2006-2010, Hu had even worked in a mine before her current job in a lumber yard (pictured) 'I did every job to support the family and my little daughter. I crawled in the field in plowing it. 'I worked in the quarry, and I learnt to make embroideries. I felt guilty as I can't give her a better life. 'My principles are simple, sharing, friendly, and working hard. I don't care much about the amount of salaries, as long as I work with a happy team and company.' From last October, with the help of local disabled people association, she has now found a job in a local lumber factory. A local disabled people association had got involved and found her the position in the lumber factory (pictured) last October . Working in the lumber yard: Hu has done a wide variety of jobs to support the family and her little daughter . She says she has also crawled in the field to plow it, worked in a quarry and learnt to make embroideries . Before going out, Hu wraps her knees with cloth before adding a pair of rubber 'shoes' made out of old bus tires . She married in 1980, and two years later her daughter was born but when her baby was only four months old, her husband abandoned them . Hu was left to support the whole family on her own despite her disability- her daughter has since married and moved away . The inspiring figure was once offered the chance of a pair of prosthetic legs but found them too uncomfortable . She said that after wearing prosthetics, her legs would swell and become very painful to walk on . Out shopping: Hu refuses to let her disability hold her back and will walk on her knees down to the shops or to work . 'Sister Strong-Will' says she doesn't feel angry about the accident that robbed her of her feet, but she said she was simply grateful that she survived .","Hu Fenglian lost her feet and part of her legs in a tragic childhood accident .

"He has already splashed out £125,000 on having everything from his calves to his nose surgically transformed but that, it seems, isn't enough for air steward Rodrigo Alves. Mr Alves, 31, has flown to Colombia, where on Monday, he went under the knife for a £50,000 six-in-one super operation. Procedures included a £13,000 nose job, his fourth so far, a £5,000 operation to fix his droopy eyes and another that saw his toes pinned back. Scroll down for video . Preparation: Mr Alves with his Colombian medical team as he prepared to go under the knife on Monday . Gruesome: Mr Alves following the bumper 'six-in-one' surgery which included his fourth nose job . Big spender: Mr Alves has now spent a grand total of £175,000 on cosmetic surgery . He also had a gruesome procedure to cut the skin around his mouth and gums to make his smile bigger for £4,000. Mr Alves, 31, who lives in London, has now racked up 30 body-changing operations - including liposuction, six-pack implants and botox fillers - in a quest to achieve the perfect body. But with UK doctors unwilling to perform any more surgery, Mr Alves was forced to approach a specialist Columbian clinic and fly to Bogota for bumper operation. The lengthy surgery saw three doctors work together  to give him the look he wanted, while also completing an £8,000 of liposuction operation. The fat, which Mr Alves gained on purpose, was then used in a revolutionary £15,000 stem cell procedure which saw the fluid combined with his own blood before being injected back into his hair and skin in a bid to halt the ageing process. But despite now having spent a whopping £175,000 on his 'dream body', the self-confessed perfectionist says that he’ll never stop going under the knife. 'It’s a long process,' he said. 'It is long-term maintenance. Once you start, it is difficult to stop. Naturally I’m a perfectionist. It’s like a snowball effect and I’m not going to stop. 'It doesn’t define the man that I am - I’m much more than silicone and cosmetic surgery - but once you get started it’s difficult to stop. 'I’m quite hard on myself and I’m scared of getting old - that’s the truth.' Mr Alves first went under the knife in 2004, after feeling too unattractive to fit in with the fashionable friends he had made while studying in London. His long list of surgery includes £8,000 on botox and fillers, £30,000 on three nose jobs, £3,000 on liposuction to his jaw and £10,000 on pec implants. Team: Dr Alfredo Alvear (left), Sandra Martinez and Miguel Barreto (right) performed the op for Mr Alves . Ready to go: Mr Alves with his medical team ahead of the operation - his 30th to date . Unhappy: Prior to his first surgery in 2004, Mr Alves says he was deeply unhappy with his looks . He has also spent £22,000 on a fake six pack, £7,000 on fillers to his arms, £7,000 on hospital bills, £7,000 on laser lipo, £6,000 on leg lipo and £3,000 on calf shaping. He also indulges in twice-yearly Botox and filler top-ups and takes a cocktail of daily pills consisting of collagen tablets, anti-water retention and hair growth tablets. His latest six-and-a-half hour surgery included an operation to repair his nose after permanent fillers in the bridge migrated to the tip of his nose, making it round. Mr Alves also had the cartilage removed from his ear to rebuild his nostrils, which doctors pinned back after they 'got bigger at the age of 27'. Quest: Mr Alves has spent the last decade on his quest to look more like a Ken doll . Expensive: Mr Alves also spent £22,000 on the perfect six pack and £10,000 on pec implants . The surgery addict also had the skin between his inside lip and gum cut to give him a wider smile, and liposuction in his legs and back, which was re-injected elsewhere in a bid to make him look younger. The party-lover insists he works hard to afford the operations with stints as a flight attendant, an image consultant and an event host. Speaking after the surgery, Rodrigo, who will now spend 10 days recovering before the bandages are removed, said: 'The theory of beauty is to look symmetrical. 'I’m hopefully going to look more symmetrical after this, and therefore more beautiful. It is hard to open my eyes and hard to breathe too but I have a lovely nurse here looking after me.'","Rodrigo Alves, 31, from London, has spent a total of £175,000 on surgery .

"Experts said resin used on one of the 'mini mummies' (pictured) was made in the 19th century . They may look like the real thing, but at least two of the mummies in the Vatican Museums' collection have been found to be fakes. Using CT scans, X-rays and carbon dating, experts said the resin used on one of the ‘Ancient Egyptian’ mummified bodies was actually made during the mid-19th century. While a scan of another revealed a mixture of male and female bones, as well as a ‘modern nail.’ The experts, led by Alessia Amenta, are due to present their findings at the museum on Thursday. The Department of Antiquities of Egypt and the Near East of the Vatican Museums set up the Vatican Mummy Project in 2007 with the aim of cataloguing, studying and restoring its collection of mummies. The Vatican collection holds nine complete Egyptian mummies, and eighteen body parts made up of heads, hands and feet. Led by Ms Amenta, the team used X-rays and electron microscopes to study chemical elements in the bandages, as well as CT scans to create 3D images of the contents inside. This involved carbon dating the mummies to determine their age, plus infrared and ultraviolet scans to show markings that would traditionally be hidden to the naked eye. The two so-called ‘mini mummies’ were originally believed to date back to Ancient Egypt, and contain a child or animal. During the tests, the researchers discovered that the wrappings around the 23-inch (60cm) long mummies were from approximately 3,000 BC, which suggested they could be real, but the bones found inside were from the Middle Ages.

A ‘modern nail’ was also found in the contents . There was a mixture of male and female bones, as well as various body parts, including an adult tibia and fibula, foot bones and a vertebrae. Embalming was practiced for more than 2,000 years and was an important after life ritual in Ancient Egypt. The earliest mummies were said to have been embalmed in around 2,600BC, but recent evidence suggests it may have started earlier. Religious ceremonies accompanied the preparation of the body for the afterlife. Priests wrapped the mummy with linen strips containing resin, placed the internal organs in the specially prepared canopic jars and blessed the entrance of the mummy’s tomb at the funeral. The mummified remains remain in good condition because the process successfully removed moisture from the body to slow down the process of decay. The Ancient Egyptians believed the body was the house of the soul so even after death the spirit could only live on if the body was preserved forever. If the body decayed, so too did the soul. In Ancient Egyptian religion, the soul was made of the ka, which remained in the tomb, the ba, which was free to fly outside the tomb and the akh which travelled to the underworld for judgement. A ‘modern nail’ was also found among the contents. ‘What a disappointment to find that the mummy in question was only a tangle of bandages arranged to simulate an ancient artefact,’ said Ms Amenta. ‘The mummy is an important witness to this phenomenon of forgery that was able to masterfully deceive collectors and often scholars. ‘Scientific investigations, carried out under the direction of Ulderico Santamaria and his assistant Fabio Morresi, have allowed us to reconstruct the manufacturing technique and probably the area and the period in which these forgers have operated. ‘Scattered in a dozen museums, there are forty examples of this particular type of mummies that Egyptologists have commonly referred to as ‘mummies child’ or animal mummies.’ Following further tests, the cartonnage - painted plaster and linen surrounding the mummified remains - was found to contain a resin that was typically used on antiques during the mid-19th century in Europe. In particular, traces of zinc and tin were found in the paints that included pigments that wouldn’t have been used at the time. Previous studies also found that a mummy in the collection identified as a female on the sarcophagus contained the remains of a male. There have been a number of fake mummies found in collections globally, but the reasons for the forgeries are not known. During the 18th and 19th century, Napoleon’s expeditions to Egypt caused a so-called ‘mummy mania’, in Europe in which people became fixated on the process. Embalming was practiced for more than 2,000 years in Ancient Egypt. The earliest mummies were said to have been embalmed in around 2,600BC, but recent evidence suggests it may have started 1,500 years earlier. Traces of  embalming agents were found in linen used to wrap bodies in Egyptian cemeteries (pictured) This caused a rise in fake mummies being created and put on display, and in some cases, criminals would publicly ‘unwrap’ these forgeries to a group of tourists who would pay large sums to see it. The Vatican Museums were set up by Pope Julius II in the 16th century to promote knowledge of art history and culture. The Etruscan Museum was established in 1837 and added archaeological finds discovered during excavations carried out from 1828 onwards in southern Etruria. Two years later, the Egyptian Museum was opened that houses ancient artefacts from explorations in Egypt, together with other pieces already conserved in the Vatican and in the Museo Capitolino. In the year 2000, the Vatican Museums opened a new large entrance that provides visitor information and other services, and on display are many new artworks, two of which were specially created for this hall. The Department of Antiquities of Egypt and the Near East of the Vatican Museums set up the Vatican Mummy Project in 2007 with the aim of cataloguing, studying and restoring its collection of mummies. The Vatican collection holds nine complete Egyptian mummies, and eighteen body parts made up of heads, hands and feet. Ms Amenta told the Catholic New Service that 'mummies were in high demand from the Middle Ages up to the Renaissance because they were burned and used as a powder in apothecary potions for various ailments.' She said that two pounds of 'mummy dust' would be equivalent to $17,000 (£11,270) today. Mummified bodies were also used to create brown oil paints. Embalming was practiced for more than 2,000 years and was an important after life ritual in Ancient Egypt. The earliest mummies were said to have been embalmed in around 2,600BC, but recent evidence suggests it may have started earlier. In August last year, traces of complex embalming agents were found in linen used to wrap bodies that were placed in tombs in one of the earliest recorded ancient Egyptian cemeteries. The formula used to treat the cloth predates the earliest scientific evidence of embalming in the area of northern Egypt by more than a millennium. Experts identified a pine resin, an aromatic plant extract, a plant gum, a natural petroleum source and a plant oil or animal fat in the funerary wrappings in unopened tombs at Mostagedda, in the region of Upper Egypt. This suggests the practice began around 1,500 years earlier than first thought.","Experts claim two of the nine mummies in the collection are forgeries .

"A Muslim cleric has declared selfies sinful, claiming that those who take them are succumbing to pride, ostentation and arrogance. Popular Indonesian cleric Felix Siauw posted a series of tweets explaining why selfies should be avoided – but reserved most of his exasperation for women, who he said were being ‘shameless’ and ‘unpure’. Siauw, who has over a million Twitter followers, wrote: ‘These days many Muslim women take selfies without shame. There are usually nine frames in one photo with facial poses that are just – My Goodness – where’s the purity in women?’ A Muslim cleric has declared selfies sinful, claiming that those who take them are succumbing to pride, ostentation and arrogance . He also said that because selfie-takers are desperate for social media views, they’re being ostentatious, and because taking a selfie makes people feel ‘cooler’, we’ve ‘fallen into the worst sin of all – arrogance’. However, there was a huge Twitter backlash against his messages by Indonesians. Hundreds have posted selfies on the social media site using the hashtag # Selfie4Siauw, Quartz reported. Many were taken by women, dozens by men – and some purely for comedy purposes, with a camel and great white shark uploaded with the hashtag. It follows a prominent religious scholar in Saudi Arabia giving the cold shoulder to snowmen – by issuing a fatwa against them. A snowfall in the middle eastern country saw Saudis eagerly building snowmen and even snow camels. However, Mohammed Saleh Al Minjed decreed that building snowmen – or indeed creating any living creature out of snow – was an insult to the Islamic religion. There was a huge Twitter backlash against Siauw's messages by Indonesians, with hundreds posting selfies using the hashtag #Selfie4Siauw . Felix Siauw posted a series of tweets explaining why selfies should be avoided . He declared that inanimate objects such as ships and buildings could be imitated – or food – but not animals, according to Gulf News. He wrote: 'God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on.' The fatwa - or religious ruling - was given a frosty reception on social media sites by some people. Blogger Mishaal complained that the ruling took the joy out of the unusual weather. He said: 'We have snow for fleeting days, maybe even hours, and there is always someone who wants to rob us of the joy and the fun. It seems that the only thing left for us is to sit down and drink coffee.' On Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names joined in the debate. 'They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,' one Twitter user wrote. Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a 'snow bride' wearing a bra and lipstick. 'The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,' he wrote. A third said the country was plagued by two types of people: 'A people looking for a fatwa for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa,' the user wrote. Sheikh Munajjid had some supporters, however. 'It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,' one wrote. 'May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognise matters that even Satan does not think about.' And blogger Al Marsad wrote: 'It has no value in our traditions… those fascinated by the West should emulate their inventions and sciences, not their culture,' according to Gulf News. Snow has covered upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia's border with Jordan for the third consecutive year. Last year the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowment (GAIAE) in the UAE issued a fatwa against living on Mars. The committee argued that an attempt to dwell on the planet would be so hazardous as to be suicidal and killing oneself is not permitted by Islam. The astronauts, the committee said, would end up dying for no 'righteous reason' and would face the same punishment in the afterlife as someone who'd committed suicide. The GAIAE has issued around two million Fatwas through its Official Fatwa Centre since its inception in 2008. In Malaysia, meanwhile, Muslim clerics have issued fatwas banning everything from yoga to Valentines Day in a bid to stop the influence of Western culture. To ensure Muslims can keep pace with the rules, an 'e-fatwa' site has been started the Globalpost reports. The issue recently came to a head at a dog-petting festival for Muslims, with the organiser receiving threatening phone calls. Muslims are taught that canines are unclean. Malaysian activist Zainah Anwar, recently wrote that Muslims are 'sick and tired of being told, yet again, of more categories of Muslims and practices to be denounced, hated and declare deviant'. Her women's rights group, Sisters in Islam, has also been targeted. It was issued with a fatwa for pushing 'liberalism'. It had pushed for Muslim women to be able to enter beauty pageants. The group were challenging the ruling. The list of fatwas now includes, Halloween, which is said to be too Christian and black metal because it is 'powerful enough to force a Muslim to forsake his faith'. Botox is banned, but can be used if medically necessary.","Indonesian cleric Felix Siauw posted tweets about why selfies are so sinful .

"Motorists in California are using less and less gas so state lawmakers are considering imposing a mileage fee to recoup lost gas tax revenue . Plummeting gas tax revenues have led California to consider imposing a fee on motorists for each mile they drive. The number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient vehicles on the state's roadways has increased in recent years, leading motorists to use less and less gas. The reduction in gas consumption has led to a reduction in gas tax revenues for the state. California collects a 2.25 per cent sales tax on gasoline and a 9.67 per cent tax on diesel. That shortfall has left less money to pay for repairs to state highways, roads, bridges and other necessary maintenance. In an effort to make up the difference, state officials are considering a plan that would replace the gas tax with an imposed fee for each mile motorists drive. 'We're going to have to find another way to finance the upkeep of the roads,' California Governor Jerry Brown said earlier this month, the San Jose Mercury News reported. He has already approved the creation of a commission to study a 'road usage charge'. The bill which created the 15-member commission also calls for it to establish a program by  2017. State Representative Mark DeSaulnier helped write the bill that Brown signed into law. He said: 'I think there's a long way to go before this is implemented. 'But we have a real problem when it comes to infrastructure in California. 'We have to do something.' California Governor Jerry Brown (pictured) said: 'We're going to have to find another way to finance the upkeep of the roads' Oregon is already testing a program which requires some drivers to pay 1.5 cents per mile driven and Colorado and Washington are considering similar initiatives. It is unclear how California's plan would handle what would occur when people drive out of state or how the miles would be monitored. California taxed nearly ten billion gallons of gas in the first eight months of 2014, 24/7 Wall Street reported.","Increase of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient vehicles has led to shortfall .

"The owners of a $4million Cincinnati mansion that was destroyed in a massive fire a year ago are suing their insurance company for $60million for allegedly refusing to cover the blaze. Jeffrey Decker, who owns an Ohio home building company, and wife Maria claim that they still haven't been paid by Chubb National Insurance Co. for the January 8, 2014 fire that destroyed their home in Indian Hill, Ohio. Despite the family paying nearly $20,000 a year in  premiums, the Deckers say that their insurance company breached their contract for coverage 'without reasonable justification,' WLWT reports. Even though the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and a slew of local agencies have investigated the blaze, the cause still has not been determined more than a year later. This $4million, 22-room mansion outside Cincinnati, Ohio, burned to the ground in January 2014 . The cause of the blaze has still not been determined, despite the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives investigating - along with state and local authorities . Jeffery and Maria Decker are suing their homeowner's insurance company for $60million because the company has allegedly refused to pay their claim . The 10,000-square-foot, 22-room mansion was 90percent destroyed in the fire, which took crews more than seven hours to bring under control. No one was home at the time and there were no injuries. The Deckers are suing for $15million in damages for alleged breach of contract and asking for nearly $45million more in punitive damages. Chubb National has declined to comment on the lawsuit. The family estimated damages from the fire totaled about $5million - including the contents of the home. The Deckers carried a policy of about $8.8million on the home and $4.4million on the property inside. There were also riders for $208,400 in jewelry, $18,687 in furs and $5,705 in art. Four cars carried an insurance of value of $83,000. No one was home when the mansion caught fire .

"If the mantra is to be believed; sugar is bad. Whether it's a sneaky cream cake or a chocolate biscuit, sometimes only a sweet treat will do. And that's without the foods and drinks that contain 'hidden' sugars, which could be leading to weight gain without being realised. Swapping a gin and tonic for Baileys, pancakes with lemon tart and clementines for orange juice are just some of the surprising swaps that can help you cut down on sugar consumption. Fruit juice counts as the more harmful 'free' or added sugar source, as the natural sugars it contains are no longer safely enclosed within the cell structure of the whole fruit . The next time you want an orange hit, choose two clementines (left) instead of a glass of orange juice (right) Registered nutritionist Angela Dowden has devised a guilt-free sugar swap system for FEMAIL that that still allows sugar cravings to be satisfied. ‘As fruit juice counts as the more harmful “free” or added sugar source, as the natural sugars it contains are no longer safely enclosed within the cell structure of the whole fruit.’ Ms Dowden explained. She advises replacing a 200ml glass of juice for two clementines, which will see you cutting out a whopping two teaspoons of sugar. She revealed that over 10 per cent of the sugar in our diet comes from alcoholic drinks. 'Surprisingly over 10 per cent of the sugar in our diet comes from alcoholic drinks and Baileys is a major culprit. Go for dry wines, or spirits with slimline mixers instead,' she suggested. And there’s no need to go without sweet thing like pancakes, cakes and ice-cream. Coffee drinkers should replace sugar with sugar alternatives, Ms Dowden advised . Have your cake and eat it too: Nutritionist Angela Dowden has devised a guilt-free sugar swap system for Femail that that still allows you to satisfy your sugar cravings . ‘Pancakes can be a lower sugar dessert if you're canny with the topping choices,’ she said. 'If you want to eat cake but still keep your sugar in check, you’ll often be better off with a small cream-filled one. 'Ice creams vary in their sugar content; two scoops of Ben and Jerry’s Cookie dough contains almost twice the sugar of two scoops Haagen Daz Vanilla, she revealed. If it’s a chocolate hit you crave, replace the bar with a slice of toast spread Nutella. ‘Nutella on toast - keep the Nutella to a level tablespoon - is lower in both sugar and calories than most chocolate bars,’ Ms Dowden advised. Cereals also get the swap treatment. 'It’s not always easy to tell which are the most sugary cereals, so always read the label. More than 15-20g sugar per 100g is a lot,' she explained. Ditch balsamic vinegar (left) in salads and have French dressing instead (right) Swap sugar in your tea for sweetener and according to Ms Dowden, 'in four cuppas a day you could save enough calories to lose a pound in a month.' Planning on a salad, soup or stirfy for dinner? Check the ingredients in your dressing and on the back of the tin as both can contained hidden sugar. 'Dressings are another potential sugar trap, so take care. There are no real rules, except for being especially careful with lower fat dressing, which can often be higher in sugar to compensate. 'Tomato soups contain a lot of natural sugars, and some added sugar too. Choose a mushroom variety to keep your sugar intake low.' 'Stir-fry sauces are ones to watch – many including this oyster sauce have sugar near the top of the ingredients list,' she continued. When it comes to drinks, coffee addicts and those who reach for flavoured water or ginger beer should watch out. 'It [coffee] can be a sneaky source of hidden sugar. A syrup-free latte is a good bet as all the sugars come naturally from the milk and don’t harm health. 'And while it may look like water,  Volvic Touch of Fruit actually contains more sugar than the Oasis drink. 'Ginger beer can be very sugary indeed - more so than Coca Cola, which has 35g per can -  so always go for a diet ginger drink,' she continued.

"Alan Barnfield is accused of having sex with a pony . A man accused of having sex with a Shetland pony was found by police sweating profusely and smelling strongly of horses. Alan Barnfield, described as a 'sexual deviant' was seen leading a Shetland pony and another animal into a dark wooded area at the end of a paddock in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, where he allegedly had sex with them. Police found Barnfield smelling strongly of horses. The 44-year-old was also equipped with a rucksack containing several cans of Lynx deodorant, a length of white electrical cable, a handheld water sprayer, a cloth, a metal dog chain and two bottles of Lucozade. DNA from one of the ponies, called Sky, was found on Barnfield. He also had images and videos of bestiality on his mobile phone. Sky was found by its owner Jodie Walton in discomfort the day after the alleged sexual attack. A vet was called to examine the animal at Oak Tree Stables in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Officers had been called by worried residents after they saw Barnfield leading the horses into a dark wooded area and they were concerned he was trying to steal them . Louise Reevell, prosecuting, told Sheffield Crown Court that Barnfield was spotted putting something around the neck of the Shetland pony and leading it and another horse to the darkened end of the paddock. The alleged incident took place at around half past midnight on August 8 2012. Ms Reevell said: 'It is at this time the prosecution say that intercourse took place out of sight in a dark wooded area at the end of the paddock.' Barnfield had denied sexual intercourse with an animal and told the court he was out walking at the time .

"President of Argentina Cristina Kirchner, who has strongly denied covering up an Iranian bombing of a Jewish centre in 1994 . Argentina has called on its Congress to dissolve its intelligence services following the death of a prosecutor who was due to accuse President Cristina Kirchner of covering up an Iranian bombing. In a nationally televised address, Kirchner strongly denied that she had sought to shield former Iranian officials suspected of the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community centre. Her appearance was the first since the death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who mysteriously died hours before he was due to give potentially explosive testimony on the alleged cover-up. During the address, she said her proposal to create a new spy agency would be presented to lawmakers by the end of the week. She did not say who might have killed Mr Nisman, but in recent letters posted on social media, she had suggested that rogue intelligence agents may have orchestrated the death in a plot against the government. In the speech, she provided no new details of the alleged plot and Kirchner herself oversees the intelligence agencies in question. Speaking while sitting in a wheelchair due to a fractured ankle, she said: 'It's unreasonable to think our government could even be suspected of such a maneuver. 'I will not be extorted, I am not afraid' of being cited by judges or denounced by investigators, she added. 'They will not make me move even a centimeter from what I have always thought.. She also added that reforming the clandestine services was a 'national debt' the South American country has had since the return of democracy in 1983. Argentina had several years of a brutal dictatorship, and Kirchner suggested that the problems of today had their roots in the years of that military government. While government officials had previously labeled Mr Nisman's allegations as absurd, Monday's speech was the first time Fernandez had taken them on directly. A TV screen in a restaurant shows the live speech by Argentina's President Cristina Kirchner during her first public comments since the mysterious death of special prosecutor Alberto Nisman . Alberto Nisman, the Argentine prosecutor, who was mysteriously found dead after he was due to accuse Kirchner of covering up the Iranian bombing of a Jewish centre in 1994 . Mr Nisman, 51, was found dead earlier this month in the bathroom of his apartment with a bullet in his right temple and a .22 caliber gun next to him. His death came days after he gave a judge a report alleging Kirchner secretly reached a deal to prevent prosecution of former Iranian officials accused of involvement in the 1994 bombing of Argentina's largest Jewish centre. The attack killed 85 people and injured more than 200. She allegedly reached the deal in exchange for economic and trade benefits with Iran. Iran has denied the accusation. A protester carries a sign that reads in Spanish 'We're all Nisman,' referring to the death of special prosecutor Alberto Nisman, in Plaza de Mayo square in Buenos Aires . Protesters hold a replica of the Argentine flag that reads in Spanish 'Cristina Assassin,' referring to President Cristina Fernandez as she delivered a live televised speech . Mr Nisman's death has produced anti-government protests and a myriad of conspiracy theories, ranging from suicide to the involvement of Iranian intelligence agents. Kirchner, 61, said the new 'Federal Intelligence Agency' would have a director and deputy, and only a few in government would have access to the agency heads, apparently a critique of a system where many in Congress have contact with intelligence officials. But Argentina's political opposition have criticised the president's latest comments. Margarita Stolbizer, an opposition member of Congress told Todo Noticias: 'The government should explain the 11 years it has managed the security services. 'The speech was filled with imprecise (statements) and lies. 'She did not give answers to the doubts about this government nor about the content of Nisman's denouncement.'","Cristina Kirchner has called on Congress to dissolve security services .

"A 19-year-old man who refers to himself as 'King Pekas' has been arrested after allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl he met on Facebook, police said on Tuesday. Abraham Bucio-Bucio, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, reportedly traveled to the unidentified girl's home, north of the city, and asked her to have sex with him after speaking to her on the social network.

Police were alerted to the alleged incident at around 9.10pm on Sunday by staff at Hillcrest Medical Center. Officers traveled to the hospital, where they found the girl in a 'catatonic state'. While there, they spoke with her sister, who alleged that Bucio-Bucio had raped her relative earlier that evening after meeting her on Facebook on Saturday, according to Tulsa World. After sexually assaulting his young victim, the teenager had then apologized to the girl through the photo messaging service, Snapchat, the sister claimed. Now, Bucio-Bucio - who is believed to be engaged - has been arrested on suspicion of first-degree rape and lewd molestation. His bond has been set at $100,000.

"Cazine McCarthy is warning women about the dangers of sending intimate pictures to their boyfriends after her former partner posted an explicit photo of her when she dumped him . A woman whose boyfriend took revenge on her when she dumped him by posting an intimate video and image of her in her underwear online has warned women about the danger of sending racy photos to their partners. Nathan Lloyd, 22, posted a picture of his former girlfriend Cazine McCarthy, of Haverfordwest in Wales, on her Instagram account and then changed her password so she could not remove it. He had received the photo from her when they were still together, along with an intimate video which he also shared online. Miss McCarthy, a mother of one, has spoken out about the incident for the first time to warn other women about the dangers of sending explicit photographs in what she described as a 'moment of madness.' She said: 'I sent a video and image of myself to Nathan because he was working away and kept asking. 'I was unsure at first but he reassured me. He said I could trust him and that he would never show anyone else. 'Looking back it was stupid and I'd never do it again. 'Women have to protect themselves. Not knowing where my picture has been shared is so frightening.' Revenge porn involves ex-partners uploading sexually explicit content of their lovers without their permission and legislation is currently going through Parliament to make it a criminal offence. The image and video of Miss McCarthy were only removed from Instagram after Miss McCarthy's friends reported it hundreds of times. She added: 'I've lost total control. 'Looking back I wouldn't have sent him the photo or the video but I can't change what happened. 'What I can do is discourage other young women from making the same mistake. 'Even if you think you love and trust someone you don't know how they will react when you break up.' During their relationship he had taken note of her passwords for her social networking sites so he could check up on her. He also followed her into town on a couple of occasions. Miss McCarthy then decided to end her relationship with him because he was 'aggressive and controlling.' Lloyd then used this knowledge to post the intimate picture on her Instagram account and change the password so she could not remove it. She begged him to take the messages down but he refused, responding with abusive messages. Miss McCarthy was horrified when she found a picture of her in her underwear had been posted on her instagram account, along with an explicit video, and her password changed by former boyfriend Nathan Lloyd . Miss McCarthy added: 'His possessive behaviour gave me the creeps. But breaking up with him only made it worse. 'He turned nasty and uploaded the private images I'd sent him as revenge. 'When I protested he showed up at my house and kicked down my door. 'That's when I called the police.' Lloyd admitted breaking the Telecommunications Act by posting the image and criminal damage and was given a restraining order. Nathan Lloyd took revenge on Miss McCarthy by sharing the private picture and video on the internet . Miss McCarthy decided to end her relationship with Lloyd after he became aggressive and controlling . He was also ordered to attend a 'building better relationships' course to learn about aggression and relationships - avoiding a prison sentence. Miss McCarthy said the picture and video made her clearly identifiable and she feared her followers on Instagram thought she wanted them to see her baring all. She said: 'I would never have thought that that brief moment of madness back then would have caused me so much grief and heartache.' 'I know people locally are talking about me and everyone knows what happened. Miss McCarthy fears people thought she shared the image on purpose and people are talking about her . 'I keep thinking that people might have screengrabbed the video and shared it with friends. 'You can see my face in the picture but not in the video. 'Everyone knew it was me though because of the tattoo on my right side and it's obvious that I was recording in my house. 'I couldn't even deny it. 'What's worse is that my followers would have thought I wanted them to see me naked. 'It was mortifying.' The picture and video were finally taken down from Instagram after reporting it as 'inappropriate or offensive' hundreds of times. Lloyd was also given a 'Building Better Relationships' order for 24 months and ordered to pay costs totalling £145. In December the CPS launched new guidelines on tackling domestic abuse which will include using technology to inflict misery on former partners. Under the new guidance issued prosecutors will be encouraged to consider how revenge porn can be treated as a form of domestic abuse. Luke King was jailed for posting the explicit image . Those convicted of revenge porn – the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – could face two years in prison under new laws. It will be made a specific offence, covering the sharing of images both online and offline, in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. It will mean that images posted to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter will be caught by the offence, as well as those that are shared via text message. Images shared via email, on a website or the distribution of physical copies will also be caught. Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet. Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images. The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions. However, the new rules do not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal – but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages. Last year Luke King, 21, of Nottingham, became the first person to be jailed for revenge porn offences in the UK. After his three-year relationship ended he posted a number of explicit images of his former partner, and changed his WhatsApp icon to one of the images. King was eventually prosecuted under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 after he ignored two police warnings not to share the X-rated images and was jailed for 12 weeks.","Cazine McCarthy ended her relationship with possessive Nathan Lloyd, 22 .

"A swarm of lightweight probes could be sent into the atmosphere of Jupiter to return unprecedented data on the gas giant, a team of scientists has proposed. The probes would be deployed from a larger spacecraft and would descend without parachutes for 15 minutes. Armed with cameras, they would also return the closest pictures ever taken of Jupiter - and these probes could arrive at the planet by 2030. Illustrated is a proposal for how the mission would work. It could launch as early as 2022, with the probes being deployed on approach to the planet. Once they hit the atmosphere they would be slowed with heat shields and return scientific data for 15 minutes before being destroyed by Jupiter's intense pressure . The proposal was put forward by Dr John Moores of the Centre for Research in the Earth and Space Sciences (Cress), at York University, Toronto and his colleagues. Orbiting and flyby probes have provided astronomers with a lot of information about the 'surface' of the outer planets and the moons that orbit those planets. However, probing deep within their atmospheres requires penetrating the dense clouds to obtain meaningful data. This would not be the first time such a misison into the atmosphere of Jupiter was carried out. In 1995 the Galileo Space Probe detached from the larger Galileo spacecraft and entered the atmosphere of Jupiter. It survived for 57 minutes, returning data about Jupiter's atmosphere. However, without a camera, it did not return any images from inside Jupiter's atmosphere. Also, weighing 747lbs (339kg), the probe was fairly heavy and required a parachute in order to pass slowly through the atmosphere and return enough useful data. Each probe, costing less than £660,000 ($1m), would weigh no more than 27.6lbs (12.5kg) and measure two feet (0.6 metres) across. In total 60 could be taken by a spacecraft to Jupiter, and to mitigate any failures if some of the probes didn't work, scientific experiments would be spread among them. They would be released by a larger spacecraft on approach to the planet. The 'mothership' would then be free to enter orbit and study Jupiter and its moons. Using smaller probes, made possible by the miniaturisation of electronics, cameras and other instruments, would allow them to survive the fall through Jupiter's atmosphere for much longer without a parachute, according to Dr Moores. 'Our concept shows that for a small enough probe, you can strip off the parachute and still get enough time in the atmosphere to take meaningful data while keeping the relay close and the data rate high,' Moores explains. This provides more space to pack in more scientific instruments and equipment. Transmitting 20 megabits of data over fifteen minutes, enough for 100 images from each probe, would be sufficient to allows scientists to get a picture of a large part of the atmosphere. And Dr Moores said a fleet of the tiny probes could launch with Esa's Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) spacecraft, which will launch in 2027 and arrive at the Jovian system in 2030. Each probe (illustrated left), costing less than £660,000 ($1m), would weigh no more than 27.6lbs (12.5kg) and measure two feet (0.6 metres) across. And Dr Moores said a fleet of the tiny probes could launch with Esa's Juice spacecraft, illustrated right, which will launch in 2022 and arrive at the Jovian system in 2030 . This would not be the first time such a mission into the atmosphere of Jupiter was carried out. In 1995 the Galileo Space Probe, illustrated, detached from the larger Galileo spacecraft and entered the atmosphere of Jupiter. It survived for 57 minutes, returning data about Jupiter's atmosphere . The mission has been named Smara for Small Reconnaissance of Atmospheres and gets its name from the wind-borne fruit of the maple tree, the samara. The Smara mission may help address various aspects of planetary science. For instance, given that more than two-thirds of the total mass of the solar system, not including the sun, forms Jupiter, its study is important for understanding the nature of the solar nebula from which our sun and all its planets formed. Additionally, Jupiter is under constant bombardment from small bodies, such as asteroids, and understanding its atmosphere would shed new light on the nature of these. The planet's atmosphere may even represent a historical record of impacts, again providing information about the composition of the solar system. Additionally, Jupiter's is the deepest of all the planetary atmospheres in the solar system and so offers an exciting laboratory for understanding flow dynamics, cloud microphysics and radiative transfer under conditions that are very different from those we see on Earth. Also, Jupiter is the closest gas giant to Earth, and there are now known to be many more similar planets orbiting other stars. Studying our nearest gas giant neighbour in close-up detail might allow us to understand the gas giants of distant stars with greater clarity. The mission is only a concept for now, but the scientists will be hoping to develop it further in order to potentially hitch a ride to Jupiter in the not too distant future.","Researchers at York University in Toronto have outlined plans to send a swarm of tiny spacecraft into Jupiter's atmosphere .
The lightweight probes would not need parachutes to survive .
Instead they would descend and operate for about 15 minutes .
In that time they would return 20 Megabits of data to an orbiting spacecraft .
This would include atmospheric data and images from 'inside' Jupiter .
The probes could be sent as part of Esa's Juice mission in 2030 ."
"Devotees of Radio 4’s The Archers have complained racy plots are reducing the soap to ‘EastEnders in a field’. Now, the head of the BBC, Tony Hall, has signalled a move to take the show back to its roots. His pledge to ensure ‘we don’t lose what is precious’ will come as a relief to listeners disillusioned with the long-running drama. Turnaround: Head of the BBC Tony Hall has signalled a move to take the show back to its roots . Lord Hall was asked in an interview about fans wanting the programme to ‘go back to being The Archers again – not EastEnders in a field’. He told Radio Times: ‘It is an extraordinary drama … I live with some Archers devotees. 'I know how people feel about [it] and I hope Gwyneth [Williams, Radio 4 Controller] and the team will be thinking about what is happening and making sure that we don’t lose what is precious.’ The turnaround comes after years of the BBC being accused of ‘sexing up’ the show. Fans have been in revolt over ‘weird storylines and soapy plots’, Lord Hall was told. Ratings rose under editor Vanessa Whitburn, who left in May 2013, but during her tenure, The Archers was transformed from a sedate tale of rural life to a serial of sensational storylines, including an arson attack and a torrid extra-marital affair. In 2011, she was criticised for killing off Nigel Pargetter, a character for almost 30 years. One fan said: ‘Are you trying to compete with soaps like EastEnders?’ Devotees of Radio 4’s The Archers have complained racy plots are reducing the soap to ‘EastEnders in a field’.

"They drink champagne with breakfast, have liposuction in lieu of dieting and think nothing of spending £86,000 on an impulse bought Range Rover. Meet the UK's flashiest families, for whom life is all about spending their hard-earned cash on just about anything that takes their fancy. Designer shopping sprees, doggy wardrobes that cost £10,000 a year to maintain and expensive boys toys such as diggers and jetskis are all among their favourite purchases - and they couldn't care less if people think their lavish lifestyles are tacky. Big spenders: Robin and Noelie Goforth spend their millions on yachts, clothes and cosmetic surgery . One such family is Doncaster couple Robin and Noelie Goforth who made their millions from a series of businesses selling everything from cars to property and even leather coats. Mr Goforth, who is now retired, made his first million aged 35 and now spends his days relaxing with a glass of champagne beside his own private fishing lake. Wife Noelie still works, albeit running one of her husband's fisheries, and when she's not doing that, spends her time indulging in lavish shopping sprees or splashing out 'the cost of a couple of cars' on cosmetic nips and tucks. Ship ahoy! The Goforths dressed in their sailing finery during a visit to their £375,000 yacht . 'Nobody's given it to us, we're not lottery winners,' she insists. 'I get up every day and I work.' Nevertheless, she's happy to admit that she loves spending money and says her wardrobe of designer clothes includes many that she's never worn. 'I don't want to be the richest woman in the graveyard,' adds the blonde, who describes her look as being 'like a Russian hooker. 'I just want to spend it and enjoy it.' Someone who would agree wholeheartedly with that assessment is Lizzie Cundy, the WAG turned gossip column fodder, who with Noelie and Robin, appears in a Channel 5 documentary entitled Britain's Flashiest Families. In it, she is seen enjoying a shopping trip in which she spends the equivalent of £131 a minute, all while gushing about her celebrity lifestyle - and her A-list friends. 'It's easier to say who isn't a friend,' she boasts. 'Eva Longoria was a friend and I'm friends with Alex Gerrard [the blonde wife of Liverpool footballer Steven Gerrard]. 'Mickey Rourke I'd class as a friend. Tom Cruise is another.' But while she enjoys hobnobbing with the stars, what Cundy really loves is spending and she says her red carpet lifestyle is the reason for her splurges. 'I love the red carpet lifestyle,' she explains. 'People say, ""Oh that girl, she'd go to the opening of an envelope"". I'd go to the opening of a Tampax box! Yes, I do love a free event.' This means dresses - and lots of them. 'I probably have to get three designer dresses a week, just because I'm going to three events a week and I have to look good,' she says. Another fan of a designer shopping spree is Leanne Couch, a mother-of-four from Newport in Wales. Splashing out: Leanne Couch spends nothing on her children but £10,000 a year on her pet dog Lucy . Wardrobe: The pet has a huge wardrobe of designer clothes and five beds - but sleeps on Mrs Couch's . But the beneficiary of her luxury spending habits isn't one of her children or even herself. Instead, her earnings are lavished on her bichon frise dog Lucy, who owns a vast wardrobe of designer clothes, as well as five different dog beds. 'I don't spend any money on the kids,' she explains. 'But Lucy will get something new every week. There are still things with tags on in her wardrobe.' In total, Ms Couch spends around £10,000 a year on her pet pooch and has a shopping list that includes beauty treatments, designer clothes and dog nappies that cost £40 a pop. 'She's had some amazing bling items over the years,' says Lucy's besotted owner. 'I love bling, I always have done and so does Lucy. A pearl lead - gorgeous!' A penchant for bling is something she shares with both Cundy and the Goforths, all of whom revel in splashing out on anything that shimmers, sparkles or shines. Cundy is seen casually buying a gold sequinned dress for £4,800 before swanning off to choose a new car - an £86,000 top-of-the-range Range Rover that comes complete with a mini fridge for her lipgloss collection. Mrs Goforth, meanwhile, spends her spare cash on designer labels - and lots of them. 'I spend my pocket money on designer labels,' she beams. 'I wouldn't say I live for them but I near enough live for them. I like shoes, the Louboutins, I like Chanel bags. I love Chanel, I love Dolce & Gabbana, I love Versace.' She also loves cosmetic surgery and has spent thousands on keeping her looks in tip top condition. 'One of my great loves in life is cosmetic surgery,' she gleefully admits. 'It is important to keep looking nice and look nice for my husband. Celebrity friends: Lizzie Cundy says she has scores of A-list friends including Eva Longoria and Tom Cruise . Expensive tastes: Cundy goes on shopping sprees that see her splash out the equivalent of £131 a minute . 'I've got friends who have put on weight and then you think, ""Why are you surprised that your husband left you?""' But staying trim isn't always easy for Mrs Goforth who cheerfully reveals that she can't be bothered to diet. Instead, she shifts the excess pounds with a casually purchased bit of liposuction. 'I'm having lipo because I'm throwing a dinner and I've got a new dress to fit into,' she explains. 'What's a girl got to do? I don't have time to diet.' Needless to say, this doesn't come cheap. 'I could not put a price on how much my husband has spent on my cosmetic improvements,' she confesses. 'It's been a few quid... You could buy a couple of cars with what I've spent at least.' Happily for husband Robin, there are some compensations, not least the £375,000 yacht he has just snapped up for the couple to enjoy. 'We've got the house, the land, the fabulous businesses and the supercars,' he beams. 'The yacht is the icing on the cake.'","Flashy families have millions in the bank and the spending habits to match .

"A jealous husband who took his former wife's cat before dumping it at the end of her road has today been cleared of theft - despite the fact that she didn't see the animal again for four months. Jonathan Brewster, 45, told police that he had taken Tracy Brewster's beloved ginger cat Marmalade from her home in Maidstone, Kent, while she was at work in July last year. He said he took the pet in a fit of rage after an argument, intending to take it to his house, but relented at the last moment and left it 200 yards down the road, intending for it to walk back. However, the animal got lost and wasn't found until four months later, 40 miles away on the side of a motorway in Surrey. Estranged: Jonathan Brewster, 45, right outside court today, admitted taking wife Tracy's beloved cat Marmalade from her home in Maidstone while she was at work in July last year . Missing: Mr Brewster said he intended to take the animal to his house, but relented and let it out at the end of the road. However the animal got lost and wasn't seen again for four months . Marmalade, known as Marmie, was only located after Mrs Brewster began a social media campaign which attracted the support of poet Pam Ayres and Made In Chelsea star Lucy Watson. The awareness drive, which also involved sponsored walks, raised more than £1,300 but cost Mrs Brewster, a mother-of-two, her job as a housekeeper. But Sevenoaks Magistrate's Court today ruled in Mr Brewster's favour today after concluding that he did not intentionally deprive Mrs Brewster of the cat - a key condition of a theft conviction. The court heard that, the day before her pet went missing, Mr Brewster emailed his brother and said he was 'going to ruin the b****'s life', and said he wouldn't 'rest until she lost everything'. Magistrates in Sevenoaks, Kent, heard how Mr and Mrs Brewster had been separated for two years and were trying to 'rekindle' their relationship in early 2014. But Mrs Brewster, 52, ended the relationship for good in May last year and Mr Brewster, a contracts manager for a property company, took the 'relationship breakdown badly'. She changed the locks on her door after her estranged husband turned up unannounced on 12 July. On 21 July came home to find Marmie missing. Ruling: Mr Brewster was today declared innocent of theft after magistrates in Sevenoaks ruled he had not intended to deprive Mrs Brewster of her pet (picture together) - a key finding in a theft conviction . Celebrity fans: Mother-of-two Mrs Brewster launched a major social media campaign to find her pet, attracting high profile supporters including poet Pam Ayres, right, and Made In Chelsea star Lucy Watson, left . Mrs Brewster phoned her sister-in-law, who said Brewster had sent his brother an email the previous day that read: 'As for divorce I'm going to ruin the b****'s life and won't rest until she's lost everything just like I have'. The court heard that Mrs Brewster twice confronted her estranged husband about stealing the cat, but each time he denied it and said it must have 'gone off to die somewhere.' Distraught by the loss of her pet, Mrs Brewster enlisted supporters - dubbed 'Marmie's Army' - to try and raise awareness on social media. The push attracted over 3,500 Twitter followers including Made In Chelsea's Lucy Watson and actress Linda Robinson. Her Facebook page 'Find Marmie' attracted over 4,000 likes. Mrs Brewster also organised a 50-mile walk while dressed as Garfield to raise Marmie's profile. She spent so much time organising the events that she lost her job as a housekeeper, the court heard. Mrs Brewster added the cat was found between the A26 and M23 by a couple who said they did not want the reward, but she sent them money anyway. Mr Brewster helped Tracy put up posters and look for Marmie but Mrs Brewster said he was 'jealous' of the cat and was only using the opportunity to get closer to her. She eventually 'called his bluff' and told him a neighbour had CCTV of him taking the cat and Brewster called the police and told them he had taken it, the court heard. Mrs Brewster told the court: 'I was devastated. I couldn't believe he would want to hurt me and Marmie in that way. Distraught: Mrs Brewster, pictured with Marmie, said she was 'searching for days' when she discovered her pet was missing. She said her estranged husband text to say that he had taken Marmie . 'I was searching for days. I texted John to say he'd been seen on CCTV, that my neighbour had CCTV and she was going to be back from holiday and look at the footage. 'The camera was fake but I hadn't realised that at the time. 'He texted me to say he'd taken Marmie and he hadn't hurt him and he was sorry.' On July 29, Mr Brewster admitted to police that he took the cat and planned to take it home to Essex. He claimed it was a joint-owned cat and left it 200 yards from the house as he didn't actually want it and it was a silly thing to do. Piers Restell, prosecuting, said Brewster admitted in a text that he had dumped the cat - but said it was only up the road and not in Surrey as Tracy suspected. Mr. Restell said: 'He texted to say sorry, he hadn't hurt him and had put him on the corner of the estate and it was wrong to do it.' Mr Brewster then told police in August: 'What happened is we had a right big fall out, I was going to take the cat back to my place then I changed my mind. 'I thought it was stupid so I left it on the corner.'","Jonathan Brewster, 45, admitted taking cat from estranged wife's house .

"A Southern California woman who killed a two-year-old girl by feeding her chili powder as punishment has been sentenced to 15 years to life in state prison. Amanda Sorensen of Apple Valley was sentenced yesterday in a Victorville courtroom, the Victorville Daily Press reported. The 24-year-old was convicted of second-degree murder last fall in the death of toddler Joileen Garcia, who would have turned five years old in a few weeks. Scroll down for video . Amanda Sorensen (left) of Apple Valley was sentenced yesterday in a Victorville courtroom. The Southern California woman who killed 2-year-old Joileen Garcia (right) by feeding her chili powder as punishment has been sentenced to 15 years to life in state prison . Sorensen - who was the caretaker of the toddler and her boyfriend's three other children on the day of the incident - tried to discipline her boyfriend's daughter for defecating in her pants by giving her chili powder . The terms of the sentencing were issued yesterday after probation officials considered Sorensen's acknowledgement of wrongdoing and her remorse, as well as her previously clean criminal history. The incident resulting in the child's death took place two years ago. At the time, Sorensen - who was the carer of the toddler and her boyfriend's three other children on the day of the incident - tried to discipline her boyfriend's daughter for defecating in her pants by giving her chili powder, according to a report by a San Bernardino County Probation Department officer. Joileen was potty training and had several accidents throughout the day. At one point Sorensen asked the girl if she had gone 'potty' to which the child responded 'no', a probation report obtained by the Victorville Daily Press reported. When it was revealed that the toddler had defecated in her pants, she was scolded by Sorensen for lying. Sorensen accepted a plea bargain that dismissed the second charge of assault on a child causing death that carries a sentence of 25 years to life . Police were called to the home after Joileen began coughing uncontrollably, expelling powder from her mouth and turned blue . The terms of the sentencing were issued yesterday after probation officials considered Sorensen's acknowledgement of wrongdoing and her remorse as well as her previously clean criminal history . The woman then placed chili powder into the girl's mouth as punishment, ordering her to swallow it. She was not aware of how much she had placed in her mouth, but knew it was a lot as the bottle was light, the report said. Sorensen cupped her hand over the child's mouth to prevent her from spitting it out. Joileen began coughing uncontrollably, expelling powder from her mouth and turned blue at which Sorensen attempted to perform rescue breathing and chest compressions. The woman then called 911. The toddler had a seizure and was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead. The toddler's grandmother, Lillian Garcia, told Sorensen, who has her own daughter (center), that she was pathetic and took a way a sweet innocent child, and hoped that she would think of Joileen often . The cause of Joileen's death was found to be asphyxia due to forced inhalation of chili powder and the death was ruled a homicide, according to a forensic pathologist . The cause of Joileen's death was found to be asphyxia due to forced inhalation of chili powder and the death was ruled a homicide, according to forensic pathologist Dr Rhee. Details in the report said that in an interview with Sorensen's boyfriend, he said chili powder was not used routinely as a way of punishment on the children but that liquid chili sauce had been used previously. Chili's main ingredient capsaicin is an irritant in humans and other mammals, causing a burning sensation in the tissues with which it comes into contact. Airway resistance increases following inhalation of capsaicin in both mild asthmatics and non-asthmatics. Capsaicin can be fatal in large quantities. Symptoms of overdose include difficulty breathing, convulsions, and changes in skin color. Sorensen's defense lawyer David Sanders said the woman was not aware that the powder would kill the child, that there was not an intent to kill and that it was a case of involuntary manslaughter. The woman accepted a plea bargain that dismissed the second charge of assault on a child causing death that carries a sentence of 25 years to life. Joileen's mother, grandmother and a 10-year-old relative appeared in court during the sentencing as they tearfully read victim impact statements. Supporters of the girl were also present wearing shirts with her picture that read 'In loving memory'. Other family members were also present who thought the sentencing was not harsh enough. Brenda Lopez, Joileen's mother, said her daughter was tragically taken away from her and that she will suffer more than Amanda ever could. She also said that Joileen brought joy and smiles to everyone in her presence. Grandmother Lillian Garcia told Sorensen, who has her own daughter, that she was pathetic and took away a sweet innocent child, and hoped that she would think of Joileen often. Her boyfriend did not appear in court for the sentencing. The woman initially told authorities that the child had found the powder and consumed it on her own, according to the report.","Amanda Sorensen, 24, from Apple Valley, California  sentenced yesterday .

"Workers inside the Houses of Parliament are being subjected to overflowing and blocked toilets, rodent infestations and leaking roofs according to a new documentary to be broadcast next month. The 160-year-old building requires an immediate refurbishment costing in excess of £1 billion before irreparable damage is  done to the historic structure. A decision saving the structure will not be made until after the election so it does not become an issue at the forthcoming poll. The Houses of Parliament, pictured, require immediate work to prevent them suffering irreparable damage . A four-part documentary on BBC2 has been granted exclusive access behind the scenes of the Palace of Westminster. Michael Cockerell, who made the documentary, told the Radio Times: 'The place is nearly falling down. It is probably the biggest building project in Britain. We saw leaking roofs; we saw paintwork and plaster work crumbling. We saw buckets to catch the drips. Even the stonework on Elizabeth Tower [the home of Big Ben] is crumbling.' The building has also seen infestations of mice, rats, moths and even pigeons. Labour MP Valerie Vaz said that two members of her staff were forced to go home sick after a pipe burst in April 2013. The leaking sewerage built up near her office, making two of her staff ill. It is understood repairs took two weeks to complete despite the threat to health and safety. She told The Times: 'I had rung facilities and it had been dealt with immediately two members of my staff would not have been sick and there would not have been faeces all over the floor. I had to ring the serjeant at arms and he dealt with it, not facilities.' Flaking and rusting iron roofs have caused major problems with leaks and require replacing . Flaking and rusting iron roofs have caused major problems with leaks and require replacing, a major study into the state of Parliament found . Some roof supports have rusted so badly they have been at risk of collapse before replacing . The historic building on the banks of the River Thames is so dilapidated that major repairs are needed or irreversible damage may be done and ‘part of our nation’s most valued heritage will be lost forever’, a cross-party report has warned. Here is just some of the work that needs to be done to the Houses of Parliament to prevent a ‘looming crisis’: . ASBESTOS . The walls and floors are infested with the dangerous substance - putting all occupants of the Palace at risk. ELECTRICS . Much of the building needs re-wiring, and generators do not produce enough power . VENTILLATION . Many original shafts are filled with wires, and a major failure of the ventilation system is judged to be inevitable. HEATING . Many boilers date from the 1930s, pipes are clogged with limescale and are in danger of fracturing – causing dangerous steam leaks which could close the Commons chamber for months . FLOODING . Faulty guttering and broken pipes cause regular flooding, and the Big Ben belfry is particularly badly affected by water penetration. Walls are damp and stained. LEAKY ROOFS . A problem throughout the Palace, particularly as cast-iron roofs are coming to the end of their life. DANGEROUS CEILINGS . Several pieces of wood fall from the fourteenth-century roof of Westminster Hall every year, while in 1980 a heavy boss fell from the roof of the House of Lords chamber . DRAINAGE . Pipes and culverts seriously overloaded because they are now expected to deal with more waste than expected. FIRE SAFETY . Out of date alarms and automatic detection systems; little ‘compartmentation’ meaning fire can spread easily. LIFTS . Oldest lift dates from 1893, several contain obsolete components. Only nine compliant with building regulations. Officials admit that there has been ‘significant under-investment’ since the 1940s, when the Commons was bombed by the Nazis. For years contractors have adopted a 'make do and mend' approach to repairs, while the Commons and Lords have continued to meet. However, experts warn the building is deteriorating at a faster pace than repairs can be carried out during parliamentary holidays. Dr Richard Ware, programme director for the Restoration and Renewal Programme, said: ‘There is very little downtime and the problem is how on earth you undertake fundamental renovations on the scale required under those circumstances. ‘The more things become antiquated the chances of a bigger crisis grow. It’s already burned down once,’ he told Business Insider. Mel Barlex, parliamentary director of estates and technical director for the programme, added: ‘Within six months of my joining I had a member stuck in a lift as a vote was underway. 'The legislation was ultimately passed by seven votes. That brought home just how serious these issues are.’ Many of the 3,000 windows will not close, iron roofs have rusted and leak, toilets regularly flood and the building is riddled with asbestos, in roof spaces, light switches, toilet systems and as a sound suppressant. A Parliament spokesman said: ‘There has been significant under-investment in the fabric of the Palace since at least the 1940s, when parts of the Palace were renovated following bomb damage during the Second World War. Other parts of the Palace have not undergone appropriate renovation since it was built. ‘To date, all intrusive renovation work has been carried out around sittings of parliament. This approach has permitted only the minimum essential maintenance and piecemeal replacement of systems at highest risk of failure. ‘Currently, the rate and speed at which work can be carried out is slower than the rate at which the building is deteriorating so the backlog of essential repairs (and in turn the risk of system failure) is growing over time.’ Brick work is also crumbling, because the Anston limestone from Yorkshire is prone to erosion . Many parts of the Houses of Parliament have not been repaired since they were built, more than 160 years ago . Paintwork in the grand corridors inside the building is also peeling, and in many areas has been damaged by water . A report two years ago found the Victorian structure is so stuffed with asbestos and leaky roofs that it will require billions of pounds of renovation just to keep it standing. It warned that MPs and Lords will have to move out of the building within the next decade to enable a massive programme of works to electrics, heating, ventilation systems, drainage and stone work. They concluded that the World Heritage Site - which contains the Commons and Lords chambers as well as suites of committee rooms, offices and dining rooms - was so poorly-maintained that it is ‘remarkable that it continues to function’. And they warned that if nothing is done to make it safe, the Palace of Westminster could fall victim to a catastrophic fire the like of which famously destroyed its predecessor in 1834.","Labour MP Valerie Vaz sent two staff home due to leaking raw sewage .

"Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson has whipped up a frenzy over his views on same sex marriage and bakery. Speaking about same-sex marriage at the Iowa Freedom Summit in Des Moines, the pediatric neurosurgeon said he had a problem 'when people try to force people to act against their beliefs because they say ""they're discriminating against me"". 'So they can go right down the street and buy a cake, but no, let's bring a suit against this person because I want them to make my cake even though they don't believe in it. 'Which is really not all that smart because they might put poison in that cake,' Dr Carson, who is on the record opposing same-sex marriage, said according to The Hill. Scroll down for video . Republican Ben Carson said that bringing a lawsuit against a baker who doesn't want to make you a cake because they have different beliefs 'is really not all that smart because they might put poison in that cake' The remarks earned the politician, who lacks the name recognition of other Republicans thought to be angling for a run at the White House, widespread attention online. Many social media users were shocked by the statements, which they interpreted as joking about Christian bakers killing gay and lesbian couples preparing for their weddings. Dr Carson later went on The Kelly File to talk about his performance at the weekend's Iowa event, which anchor Megyn Kelly praised beyond the cake comment. 'Never make your waiter or your chef angry because you don't know what they're going to put in your food,' the former professor said when asked about the event. He maintained that those offended were taking issue where there was none. While Dr Carson tried to distance himself from controversy, gay wedding cakes have repeatedly become a political issue and several bakeries have been challenged by customers who were refused service. Last year the Colorado Civil Rights Commission upheld a ruling saying that a Christian baker discriminated against couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig in 2012. The baker refused to sell them a cake to celebrate their wedding in Massachusetts because he didn't believe in same-sex marriage. Multiple bakeries in Colorado have come under investigation after refusing to make cakes based on the customers' views of same-sex marriage . Marjorie Silva, who supports gay unions, is now under investigation by the Colorado's Department of Regulatory Agencies for refusing to make a cake for a man opposed to them, KUSA reported. Mrs Silva was preparing to make cakes shaped like Bibles when customer Bill Jack told her to paint the desserts with the phrase 'God hates gays' and a picture of two men with a big X over them. She said she refused to make the cake because Mr Jack's requests were 'discriminatory and hateful'. Dr Carson's view of gay marriage previously also caused controversy in 2013. He said that he supported a traditional definition of marriage and lumped those for same-sex marriage together with that group such as the North American Man/Boy Love Association and those in support of bestiality. The doctor later said that he apologized to anyone offended. Some in the Republican presidential nominee pool are thought to be avoiding discussion of gay marriage because of changing attitudes on the topic.","Presidential hopeful and neurosurgeon was speaking at Iowa event .

"The Justice Department has been secretly gathering and storing hundreds of millions of records about motorists, raising civil liberties concerns. In an effort to build a national database that tracks the movement of vehicles across the country, a program run by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) launched in 2008. The DEA's main aim was to seize cars, money and other assets to fight drug trafficking, reported the Wall Street Journal. But the database was also being used for hunting vehicles linked to other possible crimes, such as kidnapping, killings and rape suspects, citing current and former officials and government documents. The Justice Department has been secretly gathering and storing hundreds of millions of records about motorists and has raised civil liberties concerns, a report revealed yesterday . In an effort to build a national database that tracks the movement of vehicles across the country, the program, launched in 2008 and is run by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) The National License Plate Recognition initiative connects DEA license plate readers with those of other law enforcement agencies across the country, according to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) through a Freedom of Information Act report. It was revealed that the initiative targets roadways that the DEA believes are commonly used to transport contraband. It also data mines license plate reader data to identify travel patterns. Key findings from the documents showed that by 2011, at least 100 license plate readers across the US were feeding into the database. The DEA also set up 41 plate reader monitoring stations in California, New Mexico and Texas. Many local and regional law enforcement systems contribute location information to the program which opened up to partners in May 2009 - including California’s San Diego and Imperial Counties and New Jersey, who both provide information to the DEA. The DEA has set up 41 plate reader monitoring stations in California, New Mexico and Texas (pictured two men waiting to cross the border into the US from Mexico) Some agencies are partnering with the DEA but their agreements remain secret making it difficult for the public to know who has their location information, the findings from ACLU said. Custom and Borders Patrol is one of the federal agencies that has shared information with the DEA. In a response to ACLU's FOI request, CBP said it collects nearly 100 per cent of land border traffic, which means between May 2009 and May 2013, it amounts to more than 793.5million license plates. States such as Utah have not embraced the idea of its license plate readers feeding into the database. The government wanted to add monitors on major drug-trafficking routes in the state, such as Utah's Interstate 15, to track more criminals, which alarmed privacy advocates, the Journal reported. While U.S. officials have said they track vehicles near the Mexican border to combat drug cartels, it had not been previously revealed the DEA had been working to expand the database 'throughout the United States,' the Journal said, citing an email. It said many state and local law enforcement agencies were using the database for a variety of investigations. It added it was unclear if any court oversaw or approved the program. The Journal quoted Senator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, as saying the use of license plate readers 'raises significant privacy concerns.' A spokesman for the Justice Department, which oversees the DEA, said the program complied with federal law. 'It is not new that the DEA uses the license-plate reader program to arrest criminals and stop the flow of drugs in areas of high trafficking intensity,' said the spokesman. The spokesman also said the agency has reduced the amount of time it holds the data from two years to three months. In its report, the ACLU said the DEA should be open about what it is doing so that activities can be subject to public debate. It said when programs are secret, the public has no way of challenging them or ensuring they conform with values and the law.","DEA launched program in 2008 to build national database that tracks movement of vehicles across the country .

"A multi-millionaire from the East Midlands is believed to be the first person in the world to own the 'Holy Trinity' of hypercars - with a combined worth of more than £3million. Businessman Paul Bailey already owned the £866,000 McLaren P1 and in just one day added the Porsche 918 Spyder and the LaFerrari - tripling his hypercar collection in a matter of hours. He drove with his wife and his friend to collect the Ferrari, which he ordered two years ago, before making a 200-mile round trip to Cambridge to pick up the limited edition Porsche. The three vehicles, which all boast top speeds of more than 200mph, are all considered to be 'hypercars' - top-tier cars whose features, price and rarity sets them apart from 'regular' supercars. Scroll down for video . 'Holy Trinity': Paul Bailey drives his white Porsche 918 (left) while his wife Selena drives his Ferrari LaFerrari (right) with a friend in his McLaren P1 behind.

He described his fleet of hypercars as 'totally amazing'. He said: 'I have been waiting, in real terms, about two years for the LaFerrari. Early images of these cars were snapped and emotions rose as delivery dates came closer. 'I was offered one of the first five UK cars but these did not have the level of personalisation that I have had. This is the first UK car with full personalisation and it was worth the wait. Only the best: Mr Bailey was offered one of the first five LaFerraris in the UK, but waited for customisation . Big reveal: Mr and Mrs Bailey take the wraps of their new La Ferrari - one of only 499 that will be produced . Paul and Selena Bailey made their fortunes when they sold their phone-conferencing business in 2012. The couple each held 45 per cent of the private shares in Worldwide Group Holdings, which was bought by telecoms firm Daisy Group for £28million. Founded in 2001, Worldwide Group, whose branding has since disappeared, specialised in call-handling for phone conferences, including providing free-phone numbers to conference members in different countries. It had contracts with some of the largest players in the conferencing market, and in 2011 made £4million of earnings on revenues of £36.4million. Paul is now believed to be running Horsepower Racing UK. 'I live a very surreal life and being the first to own all three does not feel real. This is why I want to use and share the cars with enthusiasts. 'It is too early to say which is the best as they are all totally amazing. I will be able to better comment when I have driven them back to back on the race track.'

"‘For a man who likes electric cars he sure burns a lot of rocket fuel.’ These were the words of Lisa Simpson to Elon Musk in his guest appearance on The Simpsons, humourously citing a supposed conflict of interest between his companies Tesla and SpaceX. But in a series of tweets Mr Musk has hit back at the opinionated cartoon character, explaining why rockets in their current form are the only way to reach orbit. South African-born Elon Musk has responded to comments made by Lisa Simpson. He appeared in the latest episode of the Simpsons on 25 January, pictured here in a still from the episode with the Simpsons family. In the episode Lisa cites a potential conflict of interest between his electric car company Tesla and SpaceX . The episode, called 'The Musk who fell to Earth', aired on 25 January. Towards the end of the episode, Mr Musk takes off in one of SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, leading Lisa to make her remark. But responding to the jibe, South African-born Musk said in a tweet: ‘If u saw @TheSimpsons and wonder why @SpaceX doesn't use an electric rocket to reach orbit, it is cuz that is impossible.’ In September last year, dreams of taking an elevator into space were given a boost after researchers created ultra-thin, super-strong nanothreads made from diamonds. The threads are made up of a long, thin strand of carbon atoms arranged in the same way as the inside of a diamond. The discovery could finally be the breakthrough needed to hoist and support cosmic elevators that would transport people into the atmosphere. The research was carried out by John Badding, a professor of chemistry at Penn State University, and the findings were published in the journal Nature Materials. He went on to say the reason is Newton’s Third Law, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. ‘In a vacuum, there is nothing to “push” against. You must react against ejected mass,’ he continued. Ever since the first rockets launched in the mid-20th century, people have wondered if there might be an easier way to reach orbit. People have dreamed up space elevators, ‘cannons’ that could launch vehicles into orbit or electric ion thrusters to slowly raise a spacecraft above Earth’s atmosphere. But as Mr Musk explains, none of these technologies are advanced enough yet to be a feasible alternative to rockets. In particular, space elevators have often been seen as a ‘holy grail’ of reaching orbit, but no one has yet developed a material that could withstand the huge strain of holding itself together - let alone lift anything into orbit. ‘[Please] don’t ask me about space elevators until someone at least builds a carbon nanotube structure longer than a footbridge,’ said Mr Musk. Responding to Lisa's jibe on twitter, Mr Musk said rockets were the only way to currently reach orbit. He said other methods like electric power were simply 'impossible'. And other proposals like space elevators or railguns were not technologically feasible yet . Elon Musk is CEO of company SpaceX, which builds and operates the Falcon series of rockets, in addition to the Dragon spacecraft. Pictured is a Falcon 9 rocket lifting off from Space Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on 10 January 2015 . Mr Musk is also CEO of electric car company Tesla, leading Lisa to cite the supposed public of interest with his gas-guzzling rockets. However, as he points out, it's simply not possible to produce an environmentally friendly way of reaching Earth orbit yet, and rockets are the best way to get into space for now . Elon Musk is the founder of electric car maker Tesla, and space exploration firm SpaceX. The South African-born entrepreneur immigrated to Canada at age 17. He then moved to America to study at the University of Pennsylvania. Mr Musk made his first fortune by helping set up money service PayPal. In September, SpaceX won a $1.6 billion contract with Nasa to resupply the International Space Station with its rockets and launchers. In August 2013, Mr Musk unveiled plans for a Hyperloop system that would offer a faster way to travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Mr Musk described the concept as a subsonic air travel machine that would stretch approximately 350 miles (560 km). It theoretically would let commuters travel between the cities in 30 minutes or less. He also has plans to colonise Mars and has even said he wants retire on the red planet. Ion thrusters, meanwhile, are a means of electric propulsion employed on some spacecraft. Rather than ejecting chemical propellant like a regular rocket, they accelerate ions to create a slow but steady thrust. They are used on some spacecraft, such as Nasa’s Dawn probe currently on its way to the dwarf planet Ceres, as they can provide sustainable propulsion over a long period of time. However, their rate of acceleration is comparable to the pressure a piece of paper exerts on your hand. Over time, this can accelerate a spacecraft to great speeds - but it is simply not possible to use such an engine to launch a rocket on earth . ‘Ion thrusters are great, but have extremely tiny force (photon thruster even less). Must have more thrust than weight or you don't go up,’ said Mr Musk. And as his final rebuttal, on whether a space cannon could be used to fire a vehicle into space, he said: ‘Anything launched by a railgun (if you could ever reach ~ Mach 27) would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere.’ Elon Musk, pictured, is the founder of electric car maker Tesla, and space exploration firm SpaceX.

"Retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro released a statement, dated this week, saying that he doesn't trust U.S. policy, but that he doesn't reject peaceful solutions to conflicts . Retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro on Monday appeared to lend his support to talks with the U.S. in his first comments about his longtime adversary since both countries agreed last month to restore diplomatic ties. But Castro, 88, stopped short of an enthusiastic endorsement of the rapprochement, announced on December 17 by his younger brother and Cuba's current president, Raul Castro, and President Obama. 'I don't trust the policy of the United States nor have I had an exchange with them, but this does not mean ... a rejection of a peaceful solution to conflicts or the dangers of war,' Fidel Castro said in a statement published on the website of Cuba's Communist Party newspaper, Granma. The U.S. and Cuba held historic high-level talks last week in Havana that are expected to lead to the re-establishment of diplomatic ties severed by Washington in 1961. 'Any peaceful or negotiated solution to the problems between the United States and the peoples or any people of Latin America that doesn't imply force or the use of force should be treated in accordance with international norms and principles,' Fidel Castro said. 'We will always defend cooperation and friendship with all the peoples of the world, among them our political adversaries.' He took power in a 1959 revolution and spent much of his 49 years in power railing against the United States, which never succeeded in many attempts to oust him. He was finally forced into retirement in 2008 by poor health and was succeeded by his brother Raul, who is now 83. 'The president of Cuba has taken the pertinent steps in accordance with his prerogatives and the powers given to him by the National Assembly the Communist Party of Cuba,' Fidel Castro said of his brother in the statement. His silence on the issue had led to speculation over his health and whether he supported his brother's rapprochement with the United States. Two weeks ago, Fidel Castro sent a letter to soccer legend Diego Maradona to quash rumors of his death. At the time, it was the first reported word from Castro in nearly three months. The letter was read on Venezuela state television network Telesur. A serious illness forced Castro to step down from duties as president in 2006, handing over leadership to his younger brother Raul. The speculation about Fidel Castro's health had been prompted in part by his failure to comment after the U.S. and Cuba declared on December 17 that they would move to restore full diplomatic relations broken a half century ago. The latest statement from Fidel was dated January 26. Quashes rumors?

"A Labour MP bidding to replace Boris Johnson as London Mayor has accused the party of trying to 'out-kip Ukip' with an 'inflammatory' leaflet on immigration. David Lammy today hit out at the flier trumpeting Labour's 'tough new approach to immigration' which boasted that the party would stop migrants claiming benefits until they have lived in the UK for two years. Mr Lammy, 42, said he had been contacted by constituents infuriated by the 'inflammatory rhetoric' used in the election leaflet. David Lammy accused Labour of trying to 'out Ukip' Nigel Farage with 'inflammatory' leaflets on immigration . The Tottenham MP, who is running for Mayor next year, tweeted a picture of the official Labour leaflet, which pledges to make foreign frontline staff speak English. But Mr Lammy said: 'We're a pro-immigration party: let's not race to the bottom trying to out-kip UKIP.' Today he accused his party of presenting a 'caricature' of foreign nurses who could not speak English. He told the Evening Standard: 'We should be strongly defending the importance of immigration and explaining how much this city in particular benefits from it.' The intervention comes after he confirmed that he would be seeking Labour's nomination in the race to replace Mr Johnson – who will fight to re-join the House of Commons in May. Mr Lammy added: 'We should be arguing that London's diversity and cosmopolitanism are part of what makes it great. 'We are a pro-immigration party and we should stay that way, engaging in the debate on immigration but not on Ukip's terms. 'What we should not be doing is taking part in a race to the bottom with the Tories and with Ukip to see who can come up with the toughest rhetoric on immigration I will be making the case for immigration strongly and proudly in the coming months.' Mr Lammy, who is standing to be London Mayor, was born in Tottenham to Guyanese parents . But a Labour spokesman defended the message of the leaflet and said Labour want to address voters' 'real concerns' over mass immigration. He added: 'This includes plans for tougher border controls, preventing employers undercutting wages and banning agencies from only recruiting abroad - setting out new rules that are both tough and fair.' Mr Lammy was born in Tottenham, north London, to Guyanese parents. He and his four siblings were brought up by his mother after his father walked out when he was 12. At 10, he won a choral scholarship to The King's School, Peterborough. He studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, and at Harvard Law School, where he became friends with Barack Obama. He entered Parliament at the age of 27 and was tipped as a future Labour leader, but failed to make it to the Cabinet after a tough time as a junior minister.","David Lammy hit out at flier trumpeting 'tough approach to immigration'

"Former German concentration camp Bergen-Belsen, where more than 70,000 Jews died at the hands of the Nazis, says it is struggling to meet the demand of visitors to the historic site. Following calls from the President of the Jewish Council to make visits to concentration camp memorials compulsory for school children over 15, the caretakers of Bergen-Belsen near Hanover said it's already at capacity with the 300,000 people who visit annually. 'We get around 1,000 group visits a year, and around half are school classes,' spokeswoman for the museum, Stephanie Billib, told The Local. The Bergen-Belsen former concentration camp is struggling to meet demand for tours at the site . The Nazi camp was liberated in 1945 after the death of more than 70,000 prisoners, mostly Jews . 'We have to turn a lot away because we don't have the capacity to accompany them all.' As the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland is marked on Tuesday, awareness is far from waning from younger generations not just from Germany but around the world - in particular countries that formed the Allied Forces against Hitler. Jewish Council head Josef Schuster told German newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that it was one thing to teach about the horrors of the past but another to give young people the chance connect personally with the sites at which they took place. 'Germany's commemoration culture has developed positively in the last 20 years,' he said. 'There are only a few of the perpetrators' generation left and young people speak more freely about this topic.' A mass grave at the site of Bergen-Belsen, about 40 miles from Hanover in Germany . Tuesday, January 27, is also Holocaust Memorial Day bringing further attention to the incidents of the past. Bergen-Belsen is turning to technology in a bid to solve its overcrowding problem and trialling an iPad app that could work in place of human guides who they are already struggling to pay to run tours. Visitors to former Nazi concentration camps have been on the rise in recent years, with Auschwitz alone rising from one million in 2006 from 94 countries to 1.43m in 2012. On Tuesday, about 300 Auschwitz survivors and a number of heads of state from Allied nations gathered at the site of the camp in formerly German-occupied Poland to commemorate 70 years since it was liberated by Soviet forces in 1945.

Holocaust survivors stand outside the gate of Auschwitz as 70 years since its liberation is marked . More than 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were executed in gas chambers or by guards or died from starvation and disease at the camps between 1940 and 1945. Norbert Lammert, Germany's President of the Bundestag (speaker of the lower house), stressed the importance of his country and the world ensuring the atrocities of the Holocaust are not forgotten. 'Later generations aren't responsible for the horrific past of our country,' Lammert concluded. 'But they do answer for how we deal with it.'","Bergen-Belsen cannot accommodate more than 300,000 visitors a year .

"Jerquan Dickson, 22, has been charged with felony aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person . A Pennsylvanian man has been charged in connection with the shooting of a teenager who allegedly threw snowballs at his car. Jerquan Dickson, 22, of York was arrested on Saturday afternoon after being accused of shooting the 15-year-old boy in the right arm and left thigh. Dickson has been charged with felony aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person. He was later freed on $150,000 bail. The unnamed 15-year-old was hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries. A witness told police that he saw Dickson follow a group of juveniles running down an alley and that one of them had a snowball. The witness then said he heard at least six gunshots and Dickson emerge from the alley and get into the driver's seat of a maroon sedan and speed off, reports FOX43. Dickson was picked up by police a short time later and he confirmed that he had followed the group of kids after his car was hit by snowballs. Police say Dickson claimed he fired a warning shot into the air and then several more shots into the snow toward the teenager and his friends. After obtaining a search warrant, police searched his home and found a 9 mm Smith and Wesson in a laundry basket, documents state. Six 9 mm shell casings were also found in the alley where the boy was shot.

"The owner of a small drone that smashed onto the White House grounds early on Monday was a federal government employee, who said he breached the secure perimeter by accident. The unidentified man, who is from Washington D.C. and does not work at the White House, came forward hours after the pre-dawn incident triggered a major emergency response and raised fresh questions about security at the mansion. A U.S. official said that the man contacted the Secret Service after reports of the crash spread across the media, and he told the agency he had been flying the drone for fun. A federal government employee contacted the Secret Service to say he was responsible for the drone that landed on the White House South Lawn, pictured, early Monday. He said he did not intend for it to go near the White House and that he had been flying it for fun . The Secret Service searched the North Lawn on Monday morning to see if anything else might be on the ground . The discovery was confirmed during a briefing on the president's trip to India and the Secret Service are currently investigating the device . Emergency vehicles surrounded the southeast corner of the White House during the pre-dawn incident . In a statement released Monday, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said: 'The individual has been interviewed by Secret Service agents and been fully cooperative. 'Initial indications are that this incident occurred as a result of recreational use of the device. 'This investigation continues as the Secret Service conducts corroborative interviews, forensic examinations and reviews all other investigative leads.' Florida Republican Rep. John Mica said the Secret Service wasn't taking the necessary steps to address the new security concern that drones presented. 'You could put light explosives on a drone and they could do an incredible amount of damage not only to the White House but to the Capitol and other government facilities. 'I know there are technologies available that can disable the electronics of a drone, and that's something they should be thinking about.' The drone was too small to be detected by the White House's radar system, the New York Times reported. It it designed to detect flying objects such as planes, missiles and large drones. The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours on Monday morning after the crash, even though President Obama and his wife were not home at the time. A U.S. Secret Service officer on duty saw and heard the two-foot-wide commercial drone fly at a low altitude into the heavily guarded complex and crash on the southeast side at 3.08am, the agency said. 'An investigation is underway to determine the origin of this commercially available device, motive, and to identify suspects,' a Secret Service spokeswoman said in an earlier statement. Josh Earnest, the White House Press Secretary, said it did not appear to pose an ongoing threat to anyone in the building. He confirmed the discovery during a briefing on the president's trip to India and said  both of the president's daughters had been at home during the time of the incident. The White House saw an increased security presence early this morning as emergency vehicles with lights flashing were clustered near the southeast entrance to the mansion. A security perimeter was set up around the White House to restrict access. There has been a string of security breaches at the White House in recent months. In September, an army veteran with a knife hidden in his pants jumped the fence and made it as far into the East Room before he was tackled. The breach led to Secret Service director Julia Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later, a college student drove up to the White House's security screening point and refused to leave, prompting his arrest. The White House was briefly on lockdown this August after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. The South Lawn of the White House on Monday morning.  Monday's incident was just one of a string of security breaches at the estate in recent months . The White House has seen a string of security breaches in recent years, with over 40 fence jumpers making it on to the estate in the past five years, including four in just the last year. Other incidents have included a wandering toddler, a naked man, and eager reality stars. October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs  and arrested by the Secret Service. September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured. The shocking security breach  launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn. August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House. November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for.","Two-foot-wide commercial drone landed in a tree just after 3am Monday .

"The Obama administration floated a plan Tuesday that for the first time would open up a broad swath of the Atlantic Coast to drilling, even as it moved to restrict drilling indefinitely in environmentally-sensitive areas off Alaska. The proposal envisions auctioning areas located more than 50 miles off Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia to oil companies no earlier than 2021, long after President Barack Obama leaves office. For decades, oil companies have been barred from drilling in the Atlantic Ocean, where a moratorium was in place up until 2008. The plan also calls for leasing 10 areas in the Gulf of Mexico, long the epicenter of U.S. offshore oil production, and three off the Alaska coast. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . COMING TO THE MID-ATLANTIC? Ocean platforms like this oil and natural gas-drilling rig could soon be regular sights off the coast of Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia . Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chair Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, is incensed at President Obama for pushing a ban on energy exploration in 12.28 million acres of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge – most of the region's land . NOT COMING TO ALASKA: Pressured by green groups, the White House wants to put more than 12 million acres of barren Alaska wilderness off-limits to oil and gas exploration . 'This is a balanced proposal that would make available nearly 80 percent of the undiscovered technically recoverable resources, while protecting areas that are simply too special to develop,' Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said in a conference call with reporters. 'The areas off the table are very small in comparison to areas on the table.' The plan, which covers potential lease sales in the 2017-2022 time frame, drew immediate reaction from Capitol Hill, where Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski called it a war on her home state, and where Northeastern Democrats objected to the proposal for the Atlantic Ocean, saying an oil spill knows no boundaries. The proposal comes as the U.S. is in the midst of an oil boom and when oil prices, and pump prices, are at near-historic lows. 'Opening up the Atlantic coast to drill for fossil fuel is unnecessary, poses a serious threat to coastal communities throughout the region, and is the wrong approach to energy development in this country,' said New Jersey Sens. Cory Booker and Robert Menendez, and Rep. Frank Pallone, all Democrats, in a statement. But many politicians from Southeastern states support offshore drilling, and had lobbied the administration to open federal waters off their coasts. 'Exploring for energy off the coast is a critical economic development issue,' said South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican. 'It will mean jobs and investment for our state, and, while we will always make safeguarding our rich natural resources a priority, it's encouraging to see the federal government finally acknowledge what we've been fighting for with our federal delegation for years.' Interior Department officials cautioned that they were in the early stages of a multi-year process, with Jewell saying they were only 'considering' a lease sale in the Atlantic and that areas could be 'narrowed or taken out entirely in the future.' For Alaska, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum Tuesday placing 9.8 million acres of the state's offshore resources off limits indefinitely. The memorandum withdraws from leasing parts of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, as well as a shallow 30-mile shelf in northwestern Alaska called Hanna Shoal, citing their importance to Alaska natives and the sensitive environmental resources. 'There are some places that are too special to drill, and these areas certainly fit that bill,' Jewell said. Obama in early 2010 announced his intention to allow drilling 50 miles off the Virginia coast, only to scrap it after the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. But the administration has allowed oil and gas companies to explore for oil and gas in the Atlantic in the meantime, which is the initial step prior to drilling. Environmental groups were quick to criticize the proposal, saying offshore drilling had not gotten safer in the years after the BP disaster. Deep water drilling platforms are controversial because of the possibility of spills from underwater wells that can only be capped with great difficulty and at great expense . LEAVE IT ALONE? Most of Alaska's Acrtic National Wildlife Refuge is mostly barren land but could produce trillions of dollars in energy resources . Congress, despite recommendations, has not passed any new laws to deal with the lapses identified in the wake of the spill, which was the largest offshore incident in U.S. history. 'This 5-year plan could destroy our coastal economies for decades to come, costing future generations the fishing livelihoods that have been part of their local fabric for generations,' said Oceana's vice president Jacqueline Savitz. But the oil industry applauded the move, saying much of the U.S.'s offshore potential remains untapped. Production from offshore areas accounts for 16 percent of the oil produced in the U.S. now. The Independent Petroleum Association of America said in a statement that while the proposal is a step in the right direction, it 'urges the administration to keep all offshore areas available to exploration.' According to documents obtained by The Associated Press through the Freedom of Information Act, at least four firms have filed applications with federal fisheries managers to conduct wide-scale seismic imaging surveys in the Atlantic to explore for oil and gas deposits. The applications for 'incidental harassment' of marine animals including endangered right whales are currently being reviewed by NOAA Fisheries. The projects involve towing seismic air guns behind vessels for hundreds of miles, over months and years. The guns emit strong bursts of air and sound, which allow crews to create two-and-three-dimensional images of the seafloor.","White House wants to open up the waters off Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia to first-ever oil drilling rigs .

"A British holidaymaker who chipped in with friends to buy £200-worth of cocaine while on a skiing holiday collapsed and died after snorting the super-strength powder. Nina Holmes, 33, was heard telling her friends 'this stuff is strong' moments before she collapsed while partying in the Bulgarian ski resort of Borovets, described as 'like Ibiza but with snow'. Miss Holmes, from Swansea, Wales, was on holiday with her long-term boyfriend Dean Herbert, 29, and their friends when she overdosed in February last year. Nina Holmes, 33, chipped in with friends to buy £200 of cocaine while on holiday in Bulgaria, but collapsed after snorting it and saying 'this is strong' An inquest at Swansea Coroner's Court today heard that Miss Holmes and Mr Herbert were regular users of cocaine - and had taken it at weekends since their relationship began in 2012. However, by last year the pair had 'cut down' on their drug use and were only snorting it 'once every six weeks'. On the third day of their holiday the pair went drinking to a bar called BJ's along with seven other friends after a day's skiing. The group, who had been to the resort once before, were drinking together when several members paid £200 for five bags of cocaine from a club rep named 'Stella'. However, they became worried because rather than the white, powdered drug they had been expecting to buy, the substance they were given looked brownish green and grainy. Despite this Miss Holmes took a bag for herself, and according to friends described the effects as 'banging' and 's*** hot'. Witnesses said she became 'euphoric' and began laughing and dancing, but before long Mr Herbert noticed she was unsteady on her feet. He tried to take her outside into the fresh air, but before he reached the door she was unconscious. He told the inquest: 'I was at the bar and I knew Nina was getting the drugs but I didn’t see it. 'I saw that Nina was unsteady on her feet and I helped her out and then she was unconscious.' Miss Holmes was dancing in nightclub BJ's in the ski resort of Borovets with long-term boyfriend Dean Herbert, 29, (right) when he noticed she was unsteady on her feet before she fell unconscious . Her friend Emma Roberts added: 'Nina gave me a clear impression that she had taken the substance but it didn’t look like what it should. 'She called out to me and when I approached her she collapsed. She was carried outside and put on a table and she was unconscious all the time. I tried to wake her up but I couldn’t.' The emergency services were called, but by that time eight other Britons who took drugs from the same batch had also collapsed. Paul Finley, who was with Nina, said: 'It didn’t look like cocaine but I still decided to use it. 'I rolled it in a note and snorted half a bag. It was a lot stronger than normal cocaine. I felt it getting stronger and stronger. At first I felt good but then I started panicking a bit. 'I had to sit down and I was really weak and I just collapsed. I lost the ability to move my arms and legs and when I was taken to the medical centre I collapsed again.' Paramedics were able to save eight of the party, but they were unable to revive Miss Holmes. Pathologist Dr Maurizio Brotto said she died of a heart attack brought on by poisoning caused by a combination of cocaine and alcohol. The inquest heard how Miss Holmes drank beers, vodka and coca cola, and shots before she decided to snort the drug and collapsed. Bulgarian police arrested a woman at the time on suspicion of providing the drugs and they are still investigating. British police are no longer involved in the case and are not seeking charges. An inquest at Swansea Crown Court heard today that Miss Holmes and her friends were concerned about the drugs they had bought because they did not look like cocaine, but decided to take them anyway . Miss Holmes had been drinking vodka drinks, shots and beers before taking the drugs, and a pathologist today revealed she died of a heart attack brought on by the toxic mix of chemicals in her system . Miss Holmes' body was flown back from Bulgaria by Mr Herbert. Her parents were away on holiday in the Caribbean when they were told of the her death and flew home immediately. Nina lived with her parents and sister in a luxury caravan on land where the family store traditional fairground rides and amusements which they rent out to events all over the country. The inquest heard that Miss Holmes had grown up helping to run the family business. She had been dating Mr Herbert for several years and friends said they were a 'lovely couple'. Swansea assistant coroner Paul Bennett recorded a conclusion of death by misadventure. He said: 'Nina thought it was cocaine and took the decision to use it. It was part of a social gathering and the intention was to enjoy themselves by partaking of this particular drug. 'It is unclear what the packet held, but I am satisfied that whatever it was it contained cocaine, whether it also contained unadulterated substances or not.'","Nina Holmes, 33, on holiday with boyfriend Dean Herbert, 29, last February .

"With all of its homes and businesses without power, it is one of the areas hardest hit by Storm Juno. But in the midst of the blizzard, the small Massachusetts island of Nantucket has welcomed a new life. At around 3.53am on Tuesday, baby Cayden Keith Moore was born at Nantucket Cottage Hospital. He was delivered with the help of a backup generator after the snowstorm swept across the small community, destroying power lines, sparking wind gusts of 78mph and causing widespread floods. Scroll down for video . 'Blizzard baby': Cayden Keith Moore (pictured with his mother, Danielle Smith) was born at Nantucket Cottage Hospital on the island of Nantucket, Massachusetts, at 3.53am on Tuesday, in the midst of Winter Storm Juno . Snowy: Cayden was delivered at the hospital (pictured on Tuesday) with the help of a backup generator after the snowstorm swept across the small community, destroying power lines and causing widespread floods . Speaking to the Boston Herald, Cayden's mother, Danielle Smith, 22, admitted she had been a 'little worried' about giving birth to her son while the hospital was running on generator power. 'I got to the hospital before it got super bad outside and by the time we did deliver we were running on generators,' said Miss Smith, joined at the hospital by Cayden's father, Corrigan Moore, 19. 'We were actually a week-and-a-half early, but we were both really excited... Before I went into active labor everyone was saying he would be the first blizzard baby of 2015, which I think is pretty cool.' Cayden, who weighs 6lbs 4.8oz and is healthy, was delivered by Dr. Margaret Koehm. New parents: Miss Smith (pictured with Cayden's father, Corrigan Moore, 19) admitted she had been a 'little worried' about giving birth while the hospital was running on generator power.

Miss Smith and Mr Moore had been advised by Dr Koehm to travel to the South Prospect Street hospital earlier than they typically would have done due to the severe weather conditions. 'They told me to go home, pack your bags and do the little things you need to take care of before the storm hits,' the new mother said. 'We were able to get to the hospital in the morning. 'It was still just the fluffy snow that wasn’t sticking yet. They told us it was probably a safer bet to just get our things together and come back in case we needed to be here when the snow got really bad.' The hospital also reached out to another expectant mother on Tuesday. She also agreed to shelter at the facility until the storm ceases, according to MyFoxBoston.com. Couple: 'Before I went into active labor everyone was saying he would be the first blizzard baby of 2015, which I think is pretty cool,' said a jubilant Miss Smith, pictured, above, in a Facebook photo with Mr Moore . Nantucket is continuing to battle the effects of Juno, which is tearing across America's East Coast. Eleven people so far have been evacuated from flooded areas of the island to a shelter. On Tuesday morning, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) reported that the community was 100 per cent without power. It is also suffering from no cell phone coverage. And Nantucket is not Massachusett's only region to have been greatly disrupted by Juno. A huge 33.1 inches of snow in the town of Lunenburg, with wind gusts topping 75mph. Meanwhile, in Boston, Juno dumped 26 inches of the white stuff on many streets, with 30mph overnight winds.

"Heart disease is on of the world's biggest killers - in 2012, an estimated 17.5 million people died worldwide, and numbers are steadily rising. Efforts to battle heart disease continue, and scientists are painstakingly conducting research into everything from stem cell technology to the behaviour of blood flow in a bid to fight back. To celebrate the British Heart Foundation's groundbreaking research, it held a photography competition showcasing the striking visuals that can come from biological imaging. The clot thickens:  This image shows a blood clot in close detail. The thick grey mesh is the clot, capturing a mixture of different cells – seen in different colours. A BHF-funded researcher in the 1970s was the first to prove that clots can cause heart attacks . The overall winner of ‘Reflections of Research’ was an image of a blood clot that could easily be mistaken for a coral reef. The incredible 'panoramic' is named 'The clot thickens' and displays what looks likes deep, dark caverns holding what look like tiny sea anemones. But these tiny 'creatures' are in fact an array of cells that have been caught up in the blood clot as it dries. It was submitted by Fraser Macrae, a BHF-funded researcher based at the University of Leeds. Indeed it was a BHF-funded researcher in the 1970s was the first to prove that clots can cause heart attacks. Seeing is believing: This image shows the intricate network of newly-formed blood vessels in the retina of a mouse eye. Understanding how blood vessels grow is an important part of understanding cardiovascular disease . Another finalist, named 'Scaffolding', was taken by Dr Anne Géraldine Guex, a BHF-funded researcher at Imperial College London. For her research she uses scaffolds containing microscopic holes to grow healthy heart cells that could potentially be implanted into a patient’s damaged heart after a heart attack. No smoke without fire: This picture is a blood vessel that doesn’t work properly and is leaking. The blood vessel is seen in red, with the leaks seen in grey. Maintaining healthy blood vessels is vital to prevent cardiovascular disease . Lifelines: Using the same computer modelling programmes that engineers use to design aeroplanes, scientists can now precisely model the blood flow in our blood vessels (pictured). These models can be used to design better techniques for dialysis, for example . The colourful 'Lifelines' was taken by Dr Francesco Iori, another BHF-funded researcher at Imperial College London. Using the same computer modelling programmes that engineers use to design aeroplanes, he precisely models the flow in blood vessels. These models can be used to design better techniques for kidney dialysis that limit the disruption to a patient’s natural blood flow. Made from stem cells: The banding seen in this microscopic view of heart muscle cells is vital for the contraction of the muscle that is needed for the heart to beat. Scientists can make heart cells from stem cells and study how changes in this banding cancause abnormal heartbeats . Another highly commended image was the striking 'Seeing is believing', by Dr Graeme Birdsey, a BHF-funded researcher in the Endothelial Homeostasis Group, NHLI Vascular Sciences at Imperial College London. The image shows the intricate network of newly-formed blood vessels in the retina of a mouse eye. Understanding how blood vessels grow is an cart part of understanding cardiovascular disease. 'Heart cells made from stem cells' looks like it could be a close-up of a butterfly wing. It was taken by Dr James Smith, a  researcher at the University of Nottingham.

"The late President Kennedy (pictured) lived in 13-14 Princes Gate, a property overlooking Hyde Park in Knightsbridge, as a young man in the 1930s . A London property formerly lived in by JFK is set to be transformed into a £150 million mega-mansion and one of the capital's finest homes. The late President Kennedy lived in 13-14 Princes Gate, an imposing property overlooking Hyde Park in Knightsbridge, as a young man in the 1930s. It was used by the US government as an ambassador's home at the time and was later owned by the Royal College of General Practitioners. But it was sold in 2010 for around £35 million - and now developers Viridis Real Estate hope to convert it into a stunning family home . Plans submitted to Westminster Council show a 30,000 sq/ft home with a huge basement which includes a swimming pool and underground car park. Estate agents estimate it could be worth as much as £150 million - making it more expensive than the penthouse down the road at One Hyde Park. For the same price, you could buy 847 'average homes' at £177,000 each. Stamp Duty on a £150 million home is £17.9 million. The lower ground floor of 13-14 Princes Gate will be one of the most impressive in London. Plans boast a swimming pool, children's pool, jacuzzi, kitchen, wine cellar, staff quarters and a gym with two changing rooms. Beneath the vast leisure complex will be underground parking for four cars. The ground floor will be made up of a formal room and dining room, an ambassadorial study and a huge lobby. Cars will be driven into a separate entrance before being lowered to the basement via a large lift. The first floor has two large rooms for entertaining and a super-sized reception room stretches across the whole front of the property. Further up there are seven bedroom suites, another kitchen, a playroom and guest sitting room. All floors can be reached by either stairs or the lift. The house was sold in 2010 for around £35 million - and now developers hope to convert it into a family home . It was the US ambassador's home  and was later owned by the Royal College of General Practitioners . Camelot is famously associated with the late President thanks to skilful media manipulation by Jacqueline Kennedy following her husband's death. In an interview shortly after he was assassinated she referred to her husband's love of the musical 'Camelot' and told the interviewer, 'there'll never be another Camelot again...' inextricably linking her husband's administration to the Arthurian legend. Viridis Real Estate first submitted plans for the development - which also included transforming 15 Princes Gate into an 11,000 sq/ft family home - in 2011. Planning permission was granted, but plans were resubmitted earlier this month. Becky Fatemi, managing director of luxury estate agent Rokstone, believes 13-14 Princes Gate has the potential to be 'one of London's most outstanding super-prime mansions'. She said: 'If refurbished and converted back into a luxury residence it could rival London's other palatial private residences such as Dudley House or 1-3 Cornwall Terrace. 'The property directly overlooks Hyde Park and it has the benefit of private gardens and terraces. 'This is prime Knightsbridge so if the property was refurbished to a high standard it could be worth £150 million.' This would place it at around £5,000 per sq/ft which is a solid price for the area but short of the £7,000+ commanded at One Hyde Park. It will also represent a supreme return for its owner, which bought the property and next door in 2010 when property prices were struggling. President John F Kennedy lived there in the late 1930s when his father was the US ambassador in London . The property was originally built in the late 1840s to designs by the architect Harvey Lonsdale Elmes. It was the residence of the merchant and investment bankers Junius Spencer Morgan and his son, John Pierpont (JP) Morgan, who offered the house to the US government as ambassadorial residence. John F Kennedy lived there in the late 1930s when his father, Joseph, was the ambassador in London. In 1955, the embassy sold the house, which was subsequently the headquarters of the Independent Television Authority and, from 1962, of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP). The college was evacuated in 1980 when the Iranian embassy siege took place next door. 'Camelot' is famously associated with the late President John F. Kennedy (pictured left) thanks to the skilful media manipulation by Jacqueline Kennedy (right) following her husband's assassination in 1963 . Ms Fatemi believes the likely buyer will be from the Middle-East with the finished home ideal for royalty. She added: 'The potential purchasers' list for a mansion of this luxury, value and importance is extremely rarefied. 'The Gulf Royals, in particular Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi would have the money, and a trophy property like this would interest them. 'It is possible an oil or gas rich state may also like it for a new embassy or ambassador's residence but at this price level I think it is more likely to be a billionaire or oil Royal buying as a London home.' The record price paid for a home in London is thought to be £140 million, which was paid for the penthouse in One Hyde Park last year. Last year's biggest sale which has been logged with the Land Registry was a penthouse on Princes Gate, which was sold for £50 million. Another mansion, a few doors down from 13-14 Princes Gate on Rutland Gate, was quietly marketed for £250 million.","President Kennedy lived in property overlooking Hyde Park in the 1930s .

"Black Hawk helicopters and truck-sized X-ray machines that are typically used along the U.S.-Mexico border have been brought to the Super Bow venue to bolster security. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) showcased the technology on Monday in preparation for Sunday’s football game between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. CBP Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske was on hand to detail key features of the agency's Black Hawks and the large mobile X-ray machines used to detect contraband and explosives. The Black Hawk helicopters and truck-sized X-ray machines  have been brought to the Super Bowl venue in Glendale, Arizona to assist with the security effort .

Within a few minutes, the machines can scan an entire semi-trailer for explosives. Tucson-based helicopters and Black Hawks will monitor the airspace around the game, which will be a no-fly zone while the game is on. The Black Hawks are used by the CBP and the Border Patrol for a variety of missions, including rescuing sick and injured people as they cross the border.

"David Cameron today signalled that he will protect benefits for Britain’s wealthiest pensioners. The Prime Minister insisted there were not big savings to be made from cutting winter fuel payments, TV licences and bus passes for the well-off. It raises the prospect of the Tories being the only major party going into the election vowing to preserve the payments for all over-65s, while cutting welfare for people of working age. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured today, gave his clearest signal yet that he will repeat his 2010 pledge to protect pensioner benefits, saying it was a matter of 'fairness' to ensure handouts continue for over-65s . Mr Cameron promised before the 2010 election that voters could ‘read my lips’ as he vowed all pensioner benefits would continue. Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg has branded the pledge ‘completely irrational’ and said he would be ‘gobsmacked’ if Mr Cameron repeated the promise in the Tory manifesto in 2015. Senior Conservatives including Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith had been urging the Prime Minister to ditch the pledge for the next election. But Mr Cameron today suggested that he would repeat the promise for the next five years, in a direct pitch to older people who are more likely to vote. He told BBC Radio4’s Today programme: ‘I made a very clear at the last election that we would keep pensioner benefits and we have kept that promise, we have kept those benefits. ‘We’ll set out our plans for that specific area closer to the election. I’ve always said that there aren’t huge savings to be made from axing these benefits and I think pensioners welcome the clarity that there has been.’ Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Labour's Ed Miliband have both promise to reduce benefits for well-off pensioners if they get into power after the election on May 7 . FREE BUS PASS . What is it? By law those over 62 get a free bus pass for off-peak travel, although the age will rise to 66 by 2020. Local authorities can extend it to others if they want to. The over-60s get one in London. WINTER FUEL PAYMENT . What is it? Those born on or before July 5, 1952, are entitled to £200 when the cold weather sets in. Those over 80 receive £300. Most payments were made in November and December. FREE TV LICENCE . What is it? The over-75s are entitled to a free television licence worth £145.50 for a colour set and £49.00 for a black and white TV. How can you hand it back? Unclear. Pensioners initially have to apply for the free licence online or at a post office. But once it has been set up the authorities keep handing out a free licence every three years to all recipients with a National Insurance number. He said protecting extra benefits for pensioners was key to ensuring fairness in Britain. ‘This country has had to make difficult long term decisions. We have had to work through a plan to get our deficit down and live within out means . ‘I don’t think it would be fair to ask pensioners to make the biggest adjustment. Because when you are a pensioner it’s more difficult to adjust your circumstances and that’s why we made the commitment that the pension would always go up by earnings or prices or by 2.5 per cent, the so-called triple lock. ‘And as a result a pensioner today has £800 more through their pension than they did when I become prime minister. ‘I think that was the right commitment to make because dignity and security in old age should be part of the promise we make to people in our country.’ The Lib Dems blocked any further welfare reform I the current coalition unless Mr Cameron agreed to axe the £2billion in benefits to the better off, including the winter fuel allowance, free bus passes and free TV licences. Labour has said it will stop winter fuel payments to 600,000 pensioners on higher and top-rate tax. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned taxpayers will have to find another £12billion by the end of the decade to pay for benefits for pensioners. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said today: 'We have said we will have some difficult decisions to get the deficit down. 'We would reverse the top rate income tax rate cuts which the Tories delivered for people earning over £150,000, but we’ve also said that we would have to take the winter allowance from the richest pensioners, pensioners with pensions over £42,000-a-year. 'That is the kind of tough choice which we are making which the Conservatives aren’t making, as we saw from David Cameron today.' Tens of thousands of families where no one works will have their benefits slashed, David Cameron is to pledge today. The current £26,000 cap would be cut to £23,000 within days of the Tories winning the general election, the Prime Minister will say. As the campaign enters its final 100 days with two polls showing his party has moved into a narrow lead, Mr Cameron is also promising tax relief for the middle classes. Reducing the welfare cap by £3,000 to £23,000 – equivalent to a pre-tax salary of around £29,300 – would hit an additional 70,000 workless households and save taxpayers an extra £135million per year (file picture) He is determined to ensure welfare is no longer a 'lifestyle choice', while rewarding those who are in work. He will pledge that the Conservatives would reduce the limit on handouts to jobless families within a week of being re-elected. Housing benefit would be removed from jobless 18 to 21-year-olds, meaning they will have to live with their parents like millions of youngsters starting out in a job. The new cuts would squeeze the incomes of 100,000 jobless households and raise money to be ploughed into apprenticeships for three million school leavers. The Coalition has already introduced a welfare cap of £26,000 per household in what polls suggest is one of its most popular policies. However, further welfare cuts have been hampered by Liberal Democrat opposition. Reducing the cap to £23,000 – equivalent to a pre-tax salary of around £29,300 – would hit an additional 70,000 workless households and save taxpayers an extra £135million per year, while the housing benefit squeeze on younger jobseekers would apply to 30,000 claimants and save a further £120million. Only claimants of Disability Living Allowance would be exempt from the new cap. The Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne visited Hecks Cider Farm in Street, Somerset, today . Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'Labour supports a cap on benefits. We will ask an independent commission to look at whether the cap should be lower in some areas. 'But David Cameron can't hide from the fact that his government has spent GBP25 billion more than planned on welfare because of his failure to tackle the low pay that leaves millions dependent on benefits to make ends meet. 'And nobody will believe promises on apprenticeships from a government that had seen the number of apprenticeships for young people fall.'","Prime Minister signals he will repeat promise to protect pensioner benefits .

"Vets have performed what could be one of the world’s smallest amputations - on a field mouse run over by a wheelie bin. The rodent - called Mickey - was left with serious injuries when Debra Tuck, 51, put out her rubbish at her home in Seaham, County Durham. She scooped up the mouse and took it to Westway Veterinary Group in nearby Houghton-le-Spring - and despite a slim chance he would survive, they carried out surgery to remove his crushed leg. Now, Mrs Tuck has decided to keep Mickey as a pet - despite admitting she is 'petrified' of mice. Scroll down for video . Back to his best: Mickey the mouse was left with serious injuries when Debra Tuck, 51, put out her rubbish . Playful: Despite the chance Mickey would not survive, vets carried out surgery to remove his crushed leg . Westway director and senior vet Jason Atherton authorised a delicate - but ultimately successful - operation that saw vet Catriona Redman remove Mickey’s front limb. Vets have since been astounded by the recovery of Mickey, who has been adopted by Mrs Tuck and her husband Gary, 56, who now live with the animal at their £135,000 semi-detached house. Mr Atherton told MailOnline that the operation cost the vet's about £200 to perform, but if someone had brought the mouse in for treatment as a pet they would have been charged about £150. Administration worker Mrs Tuck said: ‘My husband and I love wildlife and we wouldn’t hurt a fly so we couldn’t have left a tiny injured mouse to die outside in the freezing cold. ‘Even though I’m petrified of mice, I was mortified when I saw that I’d hurt him and there was blood coming from his leg. Jason thought he might not come through the operation. Up and about: Vets have been amazed by the recovery of Mickey, who has been adopted by the Tuck couple . ‘But then I got a call saying he had pulled through and I was so relieved. He has thrived ever since and is so full of character, with the brightest eyes and the loveliest coat.’ Mickey’s treatment was paid for by Westway’s £3,000-a-year fund for treating stray animals and is made up of donations - including from marathon runs by Mr Atherton and his wife Jill. Mr Atherton said: ‘His chances of survival were slim, so we had to think carefully before authorising major surgery on such a small animal. That decision has certainly proved right as mouse and owner so happy. ‘When he came in I said I would fix him if it was possible to do so. He wouldn’t have been able to be released back into the wild but I agreed to amputate if Debra was prepared to keep him as a pet. Removing the leg is relatively easy, it’s just a bit fiddly, and because Mickey was so young, he has adapted to life as a pet.’","Wild field mouse seriously injured while Debra Tuck was moving her bin .

"Volunteers scanning thousands of images from Nasa's Spitzer space telescope have made a major breakthrough in our understanding of how planets form. They reported spotting strange 'yellow balls' in images. After further analysis, researchers now believe they are the early stages of massive stars forming. Volunteers using the web-based Milky Way Project brought star-forming features nicknamed ""yellowballs"" to the attention of researchers, who later showed that they are a phase of massive star formation. The infrared wavelengths detected by Spitzer have been assigned visible colors we can see with our eyes. In addition to the yellow balls, there are many green bubbles with red centers, populating a landscape of swirling gas and dust. These bubbles are the result of massive newborn stars blowing out cavities in their surroundings. A thorough analysis by the team led to the conclusion that the yellow balls precede the green bubble features, representing a phase of star formation that takes place before the bubbles form. Volunteers scan tens of thousands of starry images from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope using the Web-based Milky Way Project, and began talking about the strange features. 'The volunteers started chatting about the yellow balls they kept seeing in the images of our galaxy, and this brought the features to our attention,' said Grace Wolf-Chase of the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. A colorful, 122-foot (37-meter) Spitzer mosaic of the Milky Way hangs at the planetarium, showcasing our galaxy's bubbling brew of stars. The yellow balls in this mosaic appear small but are actually several hundred to thousands of times the size of our solar system. 'With prompting by the volunteers, we analyzed the yellow balls and figured out that they are a new way to detect the early stages of massive star formation,' said Charles Kerton of Iowa State University, Ames. 'The simple question of 'Hmm, what's that?' led us to this discovery.' Kerton is lead author, and Wolf-Chase a co-author, of a new study on the findings in the Astrophysical Journal. The Milky Way Project is one of many so-called citizen scientist projects making up the Zooniverse website, which relies on crowdsourcing to help process scientific data. So far, more than 70 scientific papers have resulted from volunteers using Zooniverse, four of which are tied to the Milky Way Project. In 2009, volunteers using a Zooniverse project called Galaxy Zoo began chatting about unusual objects they dubbed 'green peas.' Their efforts led to the discovery of a class of compact galaxies that churned out extreme numbers of stars. In the Milky Way Project, volunteers scan through images that Spitzer took of the thick plane of our galaxy, where newborn stars are igniting in swaths of dust. The infrared wavelengths detected by Spitzer have been assigned visible colors we can see with our eyes. In addition to the yellow balls, there are many green bubbles with red centers, populating a landscape of swirling gas and dust. These bubbles are the result of massive newborn stars blowing out cavities in their surroundings. The green bubble rims are made largely of organic molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), cleared away by blasts of radiation and winds from the central star. Dust warmed by the star appears red in the center of the bubbles. This series of images show three evolutionary phases of massive star formation, as pictured in infrared images from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Volunteers have classified more than 5,000 of these green bubbles using the project's Web-based tools. When they started reporting that they were finding more reoccurring features in the shape of yellow balls, the Spitzer researchers took note and even named the features accordingly. In astronomy and other digital imaging, yellow represents areas where green and red overlap. So what are these yellow balls? A thorough analysis by the team led to the conclusion that the yellow balls precede the green bubble features, representing a phase of star formation that takes place before the bubbles form. 'The yellow balls are a missing link,' said Wolf-Chase, 'between the very young embryonic stars buried in dark filaments and newborn stars blowing the bubbles.' 'If you wind the clock backwards from the bubbles, you get the yellow ball features,' said Kerton. So far, the volunteers have identified more than 900 of these compact yellow features. The next step for the researchers is to look at their distribution. Many appear to be lining the rims of the bubbles, a clue that perhaps the massive stars are triggering the birth of new stars as they blow the bubbles, a phenomenon known as triggered star formation. If the effect is real, the researchers should find that the yellow balls statistically appear more often with bubble walls. 'These results attest to the importance of citizen scientist programs,' said Wolf-Chase. Kerton added, 'There is always the potential for serendipitous discovery that makes citizen science both exciting for the participants and useful to the professional astronomer.'","Volunteers scan tens of thousands of images  using the Web-based Milky Way Project .

"Pope Francis has received a transsexual man at the Vatican, in a landmark gesture of acceptance by a pope. Diego Neria Lejárraga, a 48-year-old Spanish man who underwent sex reassignment surgery, wrote to Francis last year to tell him that he felt like an outcast from the church. Mr Neria said that he was rejected by some his fellow parishioners at his church in the western Spanish city of Plasencia, where a priest denounced him as ‘the devil’s daughter.’ Including: Pope Francis, pictured on Sunday, invited transsexual Spaniard Diego Neria Lejárraga, 48, pictured right, and his fiancée to a private audience in the Vatican this weekend . Francis, who has become known for surprising people with unexpected phone calls, rang him on Christmas Eve. The Spaniard and his female fiancée then had a private audience with the pope at his private residence on Saturday morning. Francis has built a reputation for acceptance and even appeared on the cover of gay magazine The Advocate after responding to a question about gays saying ‘Who am I to judge’. Mr Neria told Spanish newspaper Hoy: ‘After hearing him speak on many occasions, I felt that he would listen to me.’ Invited: Mr Neria, who was born a woman, had written to Pope Francis saying that he was rejected by parishioners at his church in Spain where a priest denounced him as ‘the devil’s daughter.’ Francis’ tone on homosexuality is much more moderate than his predecessor Benedict XVI who described gay sex as ‘intrinsically disordered’. But gay rights activists were disheartened by recent comments in which he suggested that gay marriage threatens the institution of the family. A historic sex conference of Catholic bishops last October gave same-sex couples hope for greater acceptance but ultimately released a document that said gay unions are not “remotely analogous” to ‘God’s plan for marriage and the family.’","Pope Francis invited  transsexual for private audience at the Vatican .

"A man who strangled his 74-year-old neighbour to death after she rejected his sexual advances has been jailed for a minimum of 18 years. Patrick Curran, 38, killed widow Joan Roddam and hid her body underneath an upturned wheelbarrow in the field behind her home near Delabole, Cornwall, in November 2003. Truro Crown Court heard that Curran, who was 27 at the time of the murder, had images saved on his computer depicting elderly women having sex with young men and had visited 151 'granny porn' websites. Patrick Curran, 38, killed Joan Roddam (right) in November 2003 after she rejected his sexual advances . He was arrested and questioned in 2004 and again in 2014 when he was charged with her murder following the reopening of the inquiry by Devon and Cornwall Police. Curran, of Delabole, was convicted last week of a single count of murder following a two-week trial - although he chose not to attend or be represented and stayed in his prison cell. Judge Graham Cottle had adjourned sentencing to see whether Curran would be prepared to attend court but again he was not present. The court heard that Curran passed a note to prison staff at Exeter jail in which he said: 'I am an innocent man, I don't think I received a fair trial.' Prosecutor Simon Laws QC said at an earlier hearing that Curran told a GP the day before the killing he had a 'raised libido'. He also revealed that he burned some of his clothes and a computer hard drive on the day she died. A bloodstain on the blanket used to cover her up revealed DNA which was 'one billion times' more likely to belong to Curran than another man. A post mortem showed Mrs Roddam, who lived alone at the remote bungalow, had been strangled and suffered numerous other injuries to her head and body. Imposing a life sentence, Judge Cottle said Curran's computer records showed he had accessed a 'very considerable number of websites' containing pornographic images of 'mature and very mature women' engaged in sexual activity with men in their 20s. Curran buried Mrs Roddam's body under a wheelbarrow and a blanket in a field behind her house in Delabole, Cornwall (pictured is an aerial shot of the field where her body was found) 'I have no doubt that this was a particular sexual interest that you had at the time of the murder and it had much to do with the reason that you murdered Joan Roddam,' the judge said. 'The explanation for your going there, I am quite satisfied, was the sexual interest that you had acquired in mature and very mature women. 'Joan Roddam was 74 years of age - a woman who took considerable care in her appearance. She almost certainly let you in and there was no evidence of any forced entry. 'What happened then cannot precisely be known, beyond that you would have made your sexual interest apparent. She almost certainly resisted your advances. 'Whether that angered you sufficiently to strangle her to death or you killed her to silence her, I do not know. 'The strangulation took place in her bungalow. It seems she did not die at that point but in all probability lapsed into a deep unconsciousness. 'This inference can be drawn from the fact that she sustained a number of injuries in life - injuries almost certainly sustained in consequence of you manhandling her body from the bungalow and then into the wheelbarrow and to its final resting place.' The judge praised the police for their determination in bringing Mrs Roddam's murderer to justice. 'It was not until many years later, after a very comprehensive review had been carried out, that the Crown Prosecution Service were persuaded that there was sufficient evidence to charge you with murder,' he told Curran. 'By then, you had got away with this heinous crime for over a decade. 'I do not believe it is appropriate to express any view as to the quality of the decision-making process that allowed the proper resolution of this case to remain outstanding for so long - thereby prolonging the stress and anxiety for those to whom Mrs Roddam was near and dear. 'Eventually you have been brought to justice for the murder of a 74-year-old widow. You murdered her in her own home - she was vulnerable by reason partly of age and partly by her circumstances. 'As I have said, this murder was sexually motivated, not in the sense that you sexually assaulted Joan Roddam - it was never the prosecution case that you had - however, the murder was sexually motivated in the sense that it explains why you went to her home. 'You went there, I have no doubt, with the intention of having a sexual encounter with Mrs Roddam.' The judge added: 'You refused to attend your trial and you have consistently refused to attend all court appearances leading up to the trial. 'I am satisfied, following the steps taken to rule out all other explanations, that you have wilfully decided for whatever reason not to co-operate in the process. 'The court is at a loss to understand your attitude or what you considered you could achieve by it.' During the trial the court heard that Curran - who lived with his parents at the time of the murder - knew Mrs Roddam because she was friends with his mother and father. Speaking last week, Aine Rendell, the great-niece of Mrs Roddam, who was an animal lover, welcomed his conviction. 'We still find it difficult, even after all these years, to come to terms with the fact that Joan was murdered by somebody that she knew and trusted,' she said. 'Patrick is the son of Margaret Curran who cared for Frank, Joan's husband, before he died. 'Margaret remained a friend of Joan's after Frank's death and it has been hard for us to accept why somebody so close to Joan could have killed her. 'During the trial we have heard details about Joan's death that have shocked us. Joan did not deserve to die in these circumstances. 'We cannot understand why Patrick Curran did not come to court to defend himself and face us as a family.' Detective Inspector Stuart Ellis, who led the investigation, said: 'The murder of Joan Roddam occurred some 11 years ago. Since that time her family and the community in which she lived has had to deal with this tragedy and all its consequences. 'I hope that the conviction of Patrick Curran now will in some way bring comfort and reassurances to all those who have been affected.'","Patrick Curran, 38, killed Joan Roddam and hid her body in November 2003 .

"The 'father of supercross' Michael Goodwin has been denied a chance to appeal a double murder charge in the 1988 slayings of auto racing legend Mickey Thompson and his wife Trudy. The 69-year-old is serving life in prison without parole for the mysterious killing of the couple, who were gunned down in the driveway of their suburban Los Angeles home. Circumstantial evidence showed he hired two hit men to kill the couple to avenge a soured business deal before 'fleeing' overseas for more than a decade. The 'father of supercross' Michael Goodwin (pictured) has been denied a chance to appeal a double murder charge in the 1988 slayings of auto racing legend Mickey Thompson and his wife Trudy . On Monday a three-judge panel at the Los Angeles Court of Appeals unanimously rejected Goodwin's numerous claims of prejudicial errors in his 2007 trial. 'I hope Mick and Trudy are looking down,' said Collene Campbell, Thompson's sister. 'When you spend half of your life trying to have somebody convicted of a killing you know that they did, it's a tough one to wait this long. ... If it was overturned, you'd go back to square one.' Defense attorney Gail Harper called it the 'shakiest hitman case' she'd ever seen and argued there was insufficient evidence connecting Goodwin to the gunmen, who were never identified. In her 500-page appeal, she argued there were numerous flaws - evidence improperly being introduced; errors in jury instructions; and prosecutorial misconduct, to name a few. Harper told the court during arguments in October that her client was an angry jerk, but that was no crime. Mickey and Trudy Thompson (pictured) were gunned down in the driveway of their suburban Los Angeles home in 1988 . Mickey Thompson achieved international fame in 1960 when he became the first American to break the 400mph barrier - here he is seen on November 7, 1960 . In rejecting her claim that the prosecutor acted in bad faith by promising evidence in opening statements that he failed to produce at trial, the appellate court dismissed the 'defendant's often hyperbolic (and sometimes misleading) claims.' Harper said she was disappointed and numb with the conclusion of the 164-page decision, but she hadn't read it yet. She had not shared the news with Goodwin. Harper expected to file a petition for review with the California Supreme Court. Thompson gained fame pursuing land-speed records on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, driving dragsters and funny cars, and popularizing off-road competitions. Goodwin, the creator of the popular sport of Supercross, attempted to merge his highly successful business with Thompson's stadium off-road racing enterprise in 1985. But after only three months, the partnership failed. The men battled in court for more than three years until a judge issued an order for Goodwin to pay Thompson more than $700,000. Investigators stand near a covered body outside the Bradbury, California, home of auto racing legend Mickey Thompson, in this March 16, 1988 photo . Evidence showed that Goodwin told others he would see Thompson dead before he paid him a dime. Harper argued that threats are not sufficient for conviction. 'You can threaten till you're blue in the face,' she said. 'But if there's no connection between him and the people who did the killing, it's fatal to the case.' She argued that the killings occurred during a robbery. But the evidence showed the killers left behind jewelry and cash. Witnesses said they saw Goodwin casing the area with binoculars days before the killings. There also were reports during the trial that Goodwin had imported hit men from the Caribbean. Prosecutors showed that Goodwin had liquidated his assets around the time of the killings, bought a $400,000 yacht and sailed off with his then-wife to spend years in the Caribbean and elsewhere. He was arrested in 2001 when he returned to the U.S. The mystery might have died in a cold case file if not for Thompson's sister, Collene Campbell, who spent two decades pushing for Goodwin's arrest.","Michael Goodwin has been denied a chance to appeal his life sentence .

"Marshawn Lynch, the Seattle Seahawks running back who shuns the media the same way he avoids tacklers, is a man of few words and he had just seven of them at his Super Bowl Media Day appearance on Tuesday. 'I'm here so I won't get fined,' Lynch said in response to every question he faced during his mandatory session, which he abruptly cut off after about five minutes. This after saying the phrase 25 times in a row, and avoiding a potential fine of $500,000 from the NFL had he not shown up. Scroll down for video . Marshawn Lynch (above) answered all 25 questions he was asked at Super Bowl Media Day by saying; 'I'm here so I won't get fined' This after Lynch, a running back with the Seattle Seahawks (above) was told by the NFL he would face a $500,000 fine if he did not appear . For a player who maintains an intense dislike of the media spotlight Lynch found himself the center of attention at Media Day as hundreds of reporters surrounded his podium. Wearing a baseball cap and dark sunglasses that hid any hint of expression, Lynch was greeted with a loud ovation from fans who paid to watch the Super Bowl sideshow before the player known as Beast Mode on the field slipped into silent mode. Lynch spent nearly five minutes repeating the same answer before shouting 'time' and walking away from the microphone, apparently confident he had fulfilled his Media Day obligation. While the Seahawks are willing to tolerate Lynch's silent treatment of the media, the NFL has shown it does not take a similar view. Twice before Lynch has been fined $50,000 for refusing to speak to reporters and was fined another $20,000 for making an obscene gesture after scoring a touchdown in the Seahawks' NFC championship game win over Green Bay Packers. Sehawks quarterback Russell Wilson (above) also appeared at Media Day . Tom Brady (above) spoke to the press for the first time since his comments on Deflategate . There was certainly not the slightest hint of any enjoyment in Lynch's latest run in with the media and it is almost certain that the NFL will not be impressed with his farcical display. 'First off, let's not miss that he is a very unique individual and he has a way that we have embraced, that we understand Marshawn and we support him every way we can,' Seattle head coach Pete Carroll said this week. 'But, he is a very unique guy and he's got his own way of looking at things and he's also a very private person too. 'That's why the media thing is as it is.'","Marshawn Lynch, the Seattle Seahawks running back who shuns the media, gave the same response to 25 questions at Super Bowl Media Day .

"A man has been captured clinging to the roof of a car as it sped around suburban streets on Australia Day on Monday. The footage, shot in Melbourne, was uploaded to the Dash Cam Owners Australia Facebook page shows the unidentified male car surfing while other passengers hang out the windows. Filmed by a passenger in the car driving behind the foolish man, the video shows him hanging on for dear life as the car winds through the streets. Scroll down for video . A man was caught on camera car surfing on top of a vehicle through the streets of Melbourne on Australia Day . At various points in the footage the daredevil looks as though he could be flung from the car as it hits turns in the road and drivers over numerous speed humps. The driver of the car travelling behind the packed-out one can be heard saying: 'If he falls off I'm going to run him over!', sounding worried. 'Just keep a safe distance', one of her passengers urged. 'I think they may have stolen that car,' another said. The black car with the man hanging from the roof appears to be crammed full of passengers, who can be seen later flailing their arms from the windows.

At some stages the car surfer can be seen readjusting his grip, appearing to be holding on to the sides of the vehicle through open windows. The onlookers who filmed the outrageous incident continually expressed their disbelief at the man's ridiculous actions and the great speed at which the car was travelling. 'They're going 70ks (kilometres)', one passenger in the car exclaimed. Eventually the car turned off into what looked to be a residential area, and the video has already been viewed more than 85,000 times on Facebook. Commenters were outraged at the 'stupid' actions of the young man, some suggesting he deserved to fall off and injure himself. The onlookers who filmed the outrageous incident continually expressed their disbelief at the man's ridiculous actions . Many social media users were outraged by the video calling the car surfer an 'idiot' This woman suggested he should take a walk through the spinal injury ward of a hospital to see what damage he could have done to himself or others . One man suggested he had seen many injuries from people's 'stupid' actions in his days as a paramedic . 'Obviously the message is not getting through to some people, not only are they risking their own lives, but what if someone had fallen off and been run over! Bunch of idiots, let's hope this makes it to the police, we certainly don't need these tossers on our roads!!' one woman wrote. 'Is that supposed to be funny???? as a former Paramedic I find that behaviour more than stupid!!,' one man posted. 'Can we start cancelling people's Medicare at the same time they're fined for doing stupid things like this? Kind of tired of paying for other people's stupidity,' another commenter suggested. Others hoped he had fallen and learnt his lesson, and some people even thought the stunt was funny, writing 'if they want to ride a car they do it at their own risk who are you to judge.' Some thought he deserved to fall off the car for his dangerous behaviour . Others said that he should have his Medicare card cancelled if he's going to take part in such 'stupid things' This commenter was quite vindictive in his hopes for the car surfer . Others had less popular opinions saying the man should be left alone as he did it as his own risk . Victorian Police have condemned the actions of not only the car surfer but the driver of the black vehicle, calling it 'stupid dangerous behaviour'. 'There is no excuse for this sort of behavior on our roads. The driver of this car has not only put the life of the man clinging onto the roof of his vehicle at risk, he is also risking the lives of other road users,' Creina O’Grady, Victoria Police Media Officer told Daily Mail Australia. 'From the number of people who have reported these types of incidents recently we know the majority realise this is dangerous and stupid behaviour. 'However we also don't want people putting themselves at risk to take photographs of other drivers doing the wrong thing. Take details where you can and report it to police, and contact triple zero if you believe there is immediate danger,' Ms O'Grady continued. 'The driver in this incident could face serious charges including conduct endangering life and dangerous driving,' she added.","The footage was shot on Australia Day in Melbourne, Australia .

"'Can you have sex for me this weekend?' As far as requests from the boss go this has to be up there with the weirdest - or best. My mission? To put Superdrug's new sexercise workout to the test. New research shows that the average British couple has sex for 22 minutes and 48 seconds and so the health-conscious brand has released a 23-minute track designed to burn calories while you heat up between the bed sheets. My editor doesn't know this (I hope) but I have been on the lookout for some new sexy time soundtracks for a while now. It's not going well. Scroll down for audio . Toni Jones tried Superdrug's new sexercise CD in the hope of boosting her fitness between the sheets . Toni's husband Dan Kennedy, left, 'pressed stop on the stereo' five minutes into the synth-heavy track . I have cringing memories of attempting a drunken striptease to the Black Keys after the Christmas party, and a recent demand for my husband to put on some kinky tunes resulted in him buckling under the pressure and choosing a Rumer album. Great for the bedroom if you're a frisky 90-year-old I imagine. Late night radio is often a bit creepy and a Spotify search for 'sexy' playlists brings up hundreds of hours of lame R&B that wouldn't even give Russell Brand the horn. So maybe this 'music track sex aid' could be the answer? I like music, I like sex, and I'm starting to like exercise so what a brilliant excuse to combine all three in the name of work/investigative reporting... GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS . There's something terribly teenage about putting on a record then being expected to feel frisky, but after an awkward minute or so we soon remembered why we were in the bedroom. After some serious kissing, my new (decidedly un-sporty) underwear started to fall off, and it was about five minutes in that the magic happened... my husband pressed stop on the stereo. The problem was not that we felt unsexy trying to get fit, it's that the music is just plain awful. Totally naff. Beyond naff. Toni said the music speeding up introduced a bit of cardio - as well as fits of laughter to the bedroom . It's 23 minutes of cheap synthesizer sounds that went out of fashion around the same time as porn movies starring dungaree-wearing plumbers. Most modern women - and men apparently - have some standards in the bedroom, and that applies to the music they're listening to as well as their chosen partner. Instead of boosting our sex session, this 'sex aid' totally killed it and left me thinking that I would have burnt more calories walking to the pub (and probably had better sex afterwards). DOES IT WORK AS A WORKOUT? Determined to see the 23 minutes through to the end (and not to have to go to Spinning the next day) I gave it another go wearing headphones so that my husband wouldn't have to perform to 'awful Eighties lift music'. Wearing headphones while naked has its own limitations, but we eventually got into the swing of things. Toni's husband called the track, which was created with the help of fitness experts, 'awful Eighties lift music'. I decided to treat it like a normal workout, focusing on different parts of my body as the track went on, and holding certain positions or counting 20 reps of particular moves, and I did start to feel the burn on thighs, arms and stomach at various points. But shouldn't that happen anyway if you're trying hard enough? The music speeding up introduced a bit of cardio, as well as fits of laughter. The tricep dips were interesting/eye-opening. And while it wasn't exactly a HIIT workout it was enough to get my heart rate going and the morning after I definitely felt a bit of satisfying muscle soreness in my thighs and arms. Superdrug says the piece, which is free to download, is designed to sync with 'calorie-burning sex sessions' THE VERDICT . YES! Yes? Er, no. There is nothing sexy about lift music and if you have even a smidgen of musical taste I defy you to get in the mood to this synth-heavy soundtrack. Any way to squeeze a bit more exercise into the week has to be a good thing. And 80 per cent of couples say they would change their sexual routine if it helped them lose weight. But I think the answer to this might be just to have more sex, people. Workouts are called WORKouts for a reason and - even ignoring the naff notes of the track - reminding myself to hold positions or try harder in the name of fitness rather than the heat of the moment meant that sex felt almost like a chore and certainly a lot less intimate. Trying to keep up with the song's tempo sometimes interrupted the natural rhythm of things and it's not very romantic to hear your partner counting reps under their breath. Throughout the 23-minute session I kept hearing the Prince lyrics '23 positions in a one night stand' in my head, and I can't help but think that would be a lot more fun and a much better workout.

"For the majority of Europe's royals, an official car and a team made up of a squad of protection officers and at least one flunky are essential when carrying out official engagements. Not so Spain's Queen Letizia, who chose to walk from her home at the Zarzuela Palace to a meeting in Madrid this morning. Accompanied by a single bodyguard, the 42-year-old royal arrived in a similarly low-key ensemble comprised of a pair of tailored trousers and a tailored red wool coat. Low key: Spain's Queen Letizia arrives on foot for the board meeting of FEDER in Madrid this morning . Letizia was attending the board meeting of FEDER, the Spanish Federation of Rare Diseases - a body that has found itself called into action more often than usual of late, thanks to Spain's two Ebola victims. Despite the serious subject matter, the royal appeared to enjoy the event and smiled happily at waiting photographers as she left. The meeting with FEDER is a bit of a departure for Letizia who, until now, has focused her efforts on championing Spanish culture and the plight of disabled people, although latterly, health has become something of a preoccupation. Last week, she compered a meeting of the Spanish Association Against Cancer, an organisation of which she is president. A day later and she was back on the cultural beat, joining husband King Felipe for the opening of a museum in Pamplona. No car: The Spanish royal, 42, was without a car or flunkies and was accompanied by a single bodyguard . Concern: Letizia has championed more health initiatives of late and was with a cancer charity last week . During the couple's tour of Museum of the University of Navarra, they were shown a contemporary art exhibition which included pieces by a number of Spanish greats, among them Pablo Picasso. Letizia's latest meeting comes shortly after the Spanish royal family was left reeling by news that a woman claiming to be the love child of former king Juan Carlos has come forward. Ingrid Sartiau, 47, has been given the green light to take her battle for recognition by the royals forward to the Spanish Supreme Court - if she can prove her story is true. According to Ms Sartiau, she is the product of a three-night liaison between her mother Liliane, a Belgian governess, and the now 76-year-old royal in 1966. Although by then a married 28-year-old father of two, an affair would hardly have been out of character for Juan-Carlos. Feeling the cold? Letizia kept her tailored dark red wool jacket on throughout the meeting . Glamorous: She teamed her businesslike look with Links of London 'Hope' egg earrings . Throughout his marriage 'Don Juan' is said to have bedded some 1,500 women, including an alleged affair with Princess Diana while on a cruise with their spouses in August 1986. Ms Sartiau herself had no idea of the identity of her father for more than 40 years, only being told his name in 2011. Although Spanish courts rejected her paternity claims twice on the grounds that a monarch could not be subjected to such tests, Juan-Carlos' abdication last year has paved the way for a new attempt. Looking cool: Letizia donned a pair of stylish aviator sunglasses as she made her exit . Busy: The end of last week saw Letizia travel to Pamplona for the opening of a new museum . Culture: The Spanish royal has long been an enthusiastic champion of Spanish culture and the arts . Interesting: She and King Felipe were shown a contemporary art exhibition that included works by Picasso .","Letizia, 42, walked to a meeting of FEDER in Madrid this morning .

"Michael McQueenie (pictured) has been jailed for more than 11 years for raping the 14-year-old girl, who has learning difficulties and is partially blind . A rapist wearing a hi-vis jacket who attacked a 14-year old partially blind girl after he failed to find sex on Skype and WhatsApp   has been jailed for more than 11 years. Michael McQueenie, 28, from Blackburn, Lancashire, had been drinking for three hours after leaving work at a waste recycling plant and was 'sexually frustrated' after repeatedly trying and failing to arrange to have sex with women over the internet. Eventually McQueenie, who was still dressed in his work high visibility jacket, targeted the teenager after he spotted her sitting on a wall near a primary school. He lured her into bushes before ordering her to strip and raping her. The victim was found when her father, who had gone out looking for her, spotted her and McQueenie emerging from the bushes. McQueenie fled but was later arrested as the immediate run-up to the attack had been caught on CCTV. A court heard he resumed his online trawl for sex just 15 minutes after the rape. The court heard the girl has a 'multitude of learning difficulties,' and had no concept of stranger danger and had been 'inherently trusting of people.' Her teacher said: 'Anybody could ask her to do anything and she would do it.' The court heard McQueenie's actions 'destroyed' the girl's loving, devoted and protective family and had left a 'permanent and deep scar in their lives'. In a statement read out in court, her father said: 'The attack has altered our lives forever and we are completely and utterly devastated. 'I feel this has destroyed me and my family.' McQueenie admitted rape and sexual assault at Burnley Crown Court and was locked up for 11 years and seven months. He was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register indefinitely and was issued with a Sexual Offences Prevention order, banning him from having unsupervised contact with any female under the age of 16 and from living in the same household as any female under 16. An aerial view of the park where the attack on the vulnerable 14-year-old girl took place, in Blackburn . Joseph Allman, prosecuting, told the court the incident occurred on June 5 last year, after the girl had a chance encounter with McQueenie. An eyewitness had been looking out  onto the park when he saw the teenager being lured into some bushes by a stranger and went out to intervene. The man came across the girl's father, who was already looking for her. They both went into the nearby park and saw the teenager and McQueenie, but he fled when the girl's father chased after him. Initially the girl said the stranger had just touched her. She later told police she had met a 'naughty man' who told her to kiss him and take her clothes off before she was made to perform a sex act on him. Police later established several people had seen the victim sitting on a low wall with a stranger at 8.24pm, shortly before she was seen on the playing field. Judge Jacqueline Beech (pictured) told McQueenie: 'You lack remorse and any insight into the consequences of your offending on others' The stranger on the wall was described as similar to the man the girl's father had chased and eyewitnesses said he had been wearing a hi vis jacket and had been drinking beer. CCTV captured McQueenie going in to a local shop to buy beer in his hi viz jacket. McQueenie was arrested on June 11 but claimed that after leaving work he had gone home, had a lot to drink and had not gone out again. Mr Allman said: 'Significantly, he adamantly denied he was wearing a yellow hi-vis jacket that day and maintained he had never been issued with that kind of jacket.' He was re-interviewed when officers received statements from several people who had seen McQueenie sat on the wall. He maintained he wasn't the attacker but was later picked out by a witness during an identification parade. Police then spoke to his workmates, supervisor and project co-ordinator. Mr Allman told the court: 'They readily established he did have a yellow hi vis jacket and in fact was issued with it that day. 'They also established his jacket had disappeared by the following morning by the time he arrived at work. It has never been found.' 'The defendant insisted it wasn't him and ultimately tried to point the finger in the direction of what he described as ""Asian gangs"" hanging around in the area.' McQueenie's mobile phone and the laptop he shared with his mother were seized. When officers analysed the phone and computer, they found he had made extensive use of two messaging functions, Skype and WhatsApp. Mr Allman said: 'In the early hours of the morning of the day the victim was raped, he sent really vast amounts of sexually themed messages to a wide range of women who were apparently strangers, or at most online acquaintances. 'He had at least 10 specific sexual conversations, trying to meet for sex or have a webcam session and all of these exchanges ended in frustration. 'About 15 minutes after the girl was raped, he resumed contact and carried on contacting numerous women to make small talk, but also to talk about sex.' McQueenie has 37 previous offences on his record dating back to 2004. At the time of the rape he was subject to a domestic violence suspended prison sentence for assaulting his partner as she held a baby. The court heard the probation service found him to have a 'poor attitude towards women.' Burnley Crown Court, in Lancashire (pictured) heard the horrific ordeal has 'destroyed' the girl's family . In mitigation defence counsel Kenneth Hind said : 'The only major mitigation is that he has pleaded guilty. 'He is facing up to the reality of the offences themselves. 'This was an opportunist offence. It was committed within, what must be fair to say, a small window of opportunity. 'It's a terrible offence in itself, but it's a one-off situation. 'There's no history or anything that would indicate that it's likely to occur again, significantly. 'There's certainly a lack of maturity on his part, certainly in dealing with women. 'There's no doubt that there will follow a very substantial prison sentence and of course he knows that that will be the outcome.' Passing sentence Judge Jacqueline Beech told McQueenie: 'You lack remorse and any insight into the consequences of your offending on others. 'It would have been immediately obvious to you that she was very vulnerable and that's no doubt why you led her into the park and did what you did to her. 'It's clear at the time you were sexually frustrated as you had been seeking instant gratification over social media. ' 'Your offending has destroyed everything the victim's family had been working for. 'You should be absolutely ashamed of yourself. This is a long sentence and rightly so.'","Michael McQueenie, 28, raped the vulnerable girl near local primary school .

"The tradesman named as a person of interest in the case of missing toddler William Tyrell has recently had three children in his care removed from his home. It has been revealed that Bill Spedding and his wife Margaret were questioned about their treatment of children by the NSW Family and Community Services department only a few days before the washing machine repairer's property was searched for two days last week by police. However, detectives were unaware of the FACS questioning, which resulted in three young people being taken from the home, The Daily Telegraph reported. As part of the police investigation, detectives conducted a dramatic raid of the Speddings' home in Bonny Hills, and their business in Laurieton, on the New South Wales mid north coast. Scroll down for video .

The mother of one of the children who had lived with the Speddings, who said her child was taken from her home following a domestic situation in 2011, said she was shocked to discover Mr Spedding was being questioned over William's disappearance. The woman told The Daily Telegraph that she was informed about the FACs investigation into Mr Spedding back in December but was not told any further details. 'I saw Bill Spedding on TV and I rang FACs,' she said. A FACS spokesman declined to comment on the case as it was still under investigation, the paper reported. Washing machine repairer Bill Spedding and his wife Margaret told Nine News they had nothing to do with the disappearance of the toddler . Homicide detectives have taken over the investigation of  William Tyrell who disappeared on September 12 .

We mainly want to thank our friends and family for the support we have been given,' said Mrs Spedding. The couple appeared to be emotional in the interview, and Mrs Spedding broke down as she spoke of the past few days. On Tuesday and Wednesday, forensic police and detectives extensively searched a set of rooms under the home, excavated part of the backyard and drained the septic tank of William Spedding's Bonny Hills property, near Port Macquarie on the NSW mid north coast.

"Lauren Evenden left her baby near empty alcohol bottles and a tattoo kit. She has lost custody of the child after a court heard she was more interested in playing video games than looking after him . A pregnant mother who left her baby near empty alcohol bottles and a tattoo kit has lost custody of the child after a court heard she was more interested in playing video games than looking after him. Lauren Evenden's ground-floor flat in Southampton was filthy and unhygienic, a court heard, and when social workers visited the one-year-old baby, he was wearing a sodden nappy and his cot was full of milk bottles. The 21-year-old, who is pregnant with her second child, failed to take care of her baby, Southampton Crown Court was told. Social services took action after several visits to Evenden's ground-floor flat. On one occasion they found the little boy in a soiled nappy, while on another he was found lying on a urine-stained mattress. Further investigations also revealed the mother, who appeared in court wearing a baseball jacket and floral leggings, had failed to take him for his six-week-old check-up and his inoculations had either been late or missed altogether. Rob Welling, prosecuting, referred to a statement from her previous boyfriend who claimed she was more interested in playing electronic games and watching television than looking after her son. He said feeding was 'chaotic and disorganised' and described how he would have to force her to get up when the baby started to cry at night. And when prosecutors discovered the state of the flat, he added: 'It was apparent the baby had been left in his room longer than he should have been. 'He had been neglected and not looked after.' Social services carried out a further three visits. They found the baby was suffering from a sore because he had been left in a soiled nappy for too long. They arranged for Evenden to have an appointment with the doctor where she was prescribed a cream to treat the sore but she failed to pick it up, the court heard. Mr Welling said 'the final straw' came five days later when social services returned to the premises and got no response. Evenden's ground-floor flat in Southampton was filthy and unhygienic, a court heard, and when social workers visited the one-year-old baby, he was wearing a sodden nappy and his cot was full of milk bottles . It was later discovered that Evenden had left her child while she went out shopping. When she returned social workers found the baby in his room. She claimed that she had asked another resident to look after her baby but Mr Welling told the court this person had 'issues of her own' and the child should not have been left with her. As a result the child has been taken into care and the court was told it was 'unlikely' Evenden would ever get back custody. It was later discovered that Evenden had left her child while she went out shopping. When she returned social workers found the baby in his room. She admitted neglect and received a nine-month suspended prison sentence coupled with 12 months' supervision . She admitted neglect and received a nine-month suspended prison sentence coupled with 12 months' supervision. In mitigation Jamie Gammon, defending, said Evenden had struggled with child issues and had suffered depression. However, the court heard she is now living with her mother, things had improved and her situation, with regard to the unborn child, was being carefully monitored by social services. Recorder Marcus Tregilgas-Davey told Evenden she had failed in her obligations towards his care and welfare over a number of months and that it had not been a single neglect. He said: 'He didn't receive the care he should have done from his mother.'","Lauren Evenden's Southampton flat was filthy and unhygienic, court heard .

"These adorable cubs can't bear to look away as their mother plunges into a lake to catch their lunch. The cubs stood on their hind legs and watched in wonder as their dad used his claws to scoop up salmon from the Kuril Lake in Russia. The lake in the Kamchatka peninsula is known for having large red salmon. Scroll down for video . Catch and kill: The baby bears are transfixed by their mother's hands-on approach to finding their lunch at Kuril Lake in Russia . Stand in line for meal time: The cubs queue in an orderly fashion for a serving of salmon, while their mother does all the hard work . Staring contest: The cubs can't take their eyes off their mother, and only one of them appears to notice photographer Sergey Ivanov . Photographer Sergey Ivanov, 53, approached the bears by boat and captured the cubs anxious wait to see what their mother could catch. The 53-year-old said the lake 'attracts a lot of bears'. He said: 'Bears are very popular in this area and in the mouth of the river there can be around 20 bears gathering at a time. 'They spend the whole day fishing and I just watch so the bears get used to my presence and do not really pay any attention to me - I try to not impede them in any way. 'It was very interesting for me to observe the life of this big family and especially to witness their relationships. What's that: The bears stand on their hind legs as their mother sends water flying, right, as she swings her paws into the lake . Can't wait any longer: One of the cubs appears to be chewing on a piece of wood on the lake's edge as it waits for something more appetising . Game over: The cubs lose interest in the fishing expedition and walk off together in the tightest of formations . 'The reactions of the cubs were incredible - the bears displayed so much emotion.' The photographer first visited the lake in the mid-90s and has been returning ever since in a bid to snap the bears in action. Mr Sergey said: 'I saw bears there for the first time in 1995 and even 20 years on they are still my favourite object for photoshooting.'","The cubs were transfixed by their mother's efforts to catch them a salmon from the lake for lunch .

"Lord Thomas, the Lord Chief Justice, said he was ‘in no doubt’ access to pornography online encouraged perverts to turn their fantasies into reality . Extreme online pornography is fuelling rape and murder, the country’s most senior judge warned yesterday. Lord Thomas said vile internet material undoubtedly encouraged sex fiends to turn their fantasies into reality. His hard-hitting comments, given in evidence to MPs yesterday, add huge weight to the Mail’s Block Online Porn campaign. The Lord Chief Justice specifically referred to the appalling murder of Georgia Williams. Jamie Reynolds, who was obsessed with violent online images, had convinced the 17-year-old to pose for him with a rope around her neck for a ‘fantasy photoshoot’. But he kicked away the box she was standing on, left her hanging and took pictures of her naked after she died. The 23-year-old pervert had been watching extreme pornography immediately before Georgia arrived at his home. Lord Thomas, who threw out Reynolds’ appeal against his whole life term last year, said the case ‘left me in no doubt at all that the peddling of pornography on the internet had a dramatic effect on the individual’. He added: ‘What is available to download and to see is simply horrific and it played a real part in the way in which this particular murder was carried out.’ He told the Commons justice committee the crime in May 2013 had been influenced – and intensified – by pornography. It was hard to believe, he said, that Reynolds could have come up with his sickening plan without first reading about similar fantasies or offences online. Michael Ellis, a barrister and Tory MP, said the Lord Chief Justice’s evidence was significant because judges knew better than almost anyone about the driving forces behind offences. He added: ‘If the impression he has been left with, having dealt with some of the most serious cases, that extreme pornography is influencing some crimes, then I think that is very persuasive.’ In October 2012, Mark Bridger was jailed for a whole-life term after being found guilty of killing five-year-old April Jones a year earlier. He had searched for images of child abuse and rape. And in May 2013, Stuart Hazell was jailed for murdering 12-year-old Tia Sharp after scouring the internet for vile child porn using terms such as ‘violent forced rape’ and ‘incest’. More protection: In a crackdown on digital perverts, the Government created a specific offence of communicating sexually with someone under the age of 16 – closing a gaping legal loophole . Campaigners have repeatedly called for internet service providers to block violent and child pornography. And, after the long-running Mail campaign to block internet porn, the Government gave families the choice of whether to opt in or block online pornography from home networks. Ministers have also forced internet giants to block searches for around 100,000 terms relating to child abuse. Last week internet providers Sky and TalkTalk become the latest firms to place an automatic block on pornographic websites. Campaigners are putting pressure on BT and Virgin Media to follow suit. In the Reynolds case, Stafford Crown Court was told he had written a horrific story entitled Georgia Williams In Surprise in which he outlined how he was going to kill her. Prosecutors said the ‘sexual deviant’ from Wellington, Shropshire, had a ‘morbid fascination in pornography depicting violence towards young women’. Lord Thomas, who became head of the judiciary of England and Wales in late 2013, also raised the prospect of high-profile extradition cases being broadcast live on television. A pilot scheme has seen some Supreme Court and Court of Appeal hearings shown to viewers for the first time, he told MPs. But Lord Thomas said televising criminal sentencing or appeals could inadvertently force victims to re-live harrowing evidence or show details that could encourage other crimes.","The Lord Chief Justice says porn encourages perverts to enact fantasies .

"U.S. stocks closed more than 1 percent lower on Tuesday after disappointing outlooks from Caterpillar and Microsoft raised worries about future profit growth at companies, while an unexpected decline in durable goods orders also weighed on sentiment. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 291 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 17,387 on Tuesday. The blue-chip average had dropped as much as 390 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 27 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,029. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 90 points, or 1.9 percent, to 4,681. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 291 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 17,387 on Tuesday. The blue-chip average had dropped as much as 390 points earlier in the day. The day's losses were broad, with nine of the 10 primary S&P 500 sectors lower on the day, though tech was the biggest drag by far. The group lost 3.3 percent in its biggest one-day drop since November 2011, in the wake of results from industry bellwether Microsoft. Industrial shares fell, led by Caterpillar. The two names were the biggest decliners on the Dow, but fellow components Procter & Gable and DuPont Co also tumbled. Microsoft fell 9.3 percent to $42.66 a day after the main engine of its historic earnings power - selling Windows and Office to big businesses - showed signs of waning. Heavy machinery marker Caterpillar gave an outlook below expectations, warning that the recent plunge in oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business. Shares dropped 7.2 percent to $79.85. 'There's clearly a lot of froth baked into certain areas of tech, while Caterpillar is giving tangible evidence that things can go down more than they already have,' said Jim O'Donnell, chief investment officer at Forward in San Francisco. U.S. stocks closed more than 1 percent lower on Tuesday after disappointing outlooks from Caterpillar and Microsoft raised worries about future profit growth at companies . 'People may not be aware of the sensitivities that heavy industrial guys have to the oil cycle, or what the ripple effects of oil's weakness will be. There are a lot of companies that are going to be adversely impacted.' With 24 percent of the S&P 500 having reported, 70.6 percent of companies have topped earnings expectations while 55.5 percent have beaten on revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with the long-term average of 63 percent for earnings and 61 percent for revenue. Many multinational companies disappointed this quarter, with the stronger dollar a common culprit. P&G was one of the companies pressured by a stronger dollar, sending shares down 3.4 percent to $86.49. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 291.49 points, or 1.65 percent, to 17,387.21, the S&P 500 lost 27.54 points, or 1.34 percent, to 2,029.55 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 90.27 points, or 1.89 percent, to 4,681.50. Adding to the day's weakness, a gauge of U.S. business investment plans unexpectedly fell in December, another sign that slowing global growth and falling crude oil prices were having an impact on the economy. On the plus side, consumer confidence posted its highest reading since August 2007. That helped indexes recover from their lows of the session; the Dow earlier fell as much as 2.2 percent. Microsoft fell 9.3 percent to $42.66 a day after the main engine of its historic earnings power - selling Windows and Office to big businesses - showed signs of waning . Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,726 to 1,337, for a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,710 issues fell and 1,029 advanced, for a 1.66-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 49 new lows. 'U.S. equities could come under pressure as investors ratchet down their growth estimates for the U.S. economy,' said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. 'There was just too much hype about the U.S. economy having risen into a new and higher growth channel. We're still stumbling along.' Investors were also gearing up for a two-day Federal Reserve meeting that concludes on Wednesday. Investors will be looking for the Fed's commentary on how weak earnings and eurozone uncertainty affect the time-frame for raising interest rates. Investors widely expect the Fed to acknowledge the uncertain global outlook and stick to its promise to be patient on tightening. Yet its timetable remains for higher rates by mid-year, a trajectory that presages further broad-based gains for the dollar. Heavy machinery marker Caterpillar gave an outlook below expectations, warning that the recent plunge in oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business . Markets in Britain, France and Germany all dropped sharply as Greece's new government was on a collision course with creditors over plans to renegotiate its enormous bailout. The leftist government that came to power in Athens following elections on Sunday looks set on a collision course with the country's creditors. U.S.-traded shares of the National Bank of Greece fell 14.5 percent to $1.32. Russia was also in the spotlight after a cut to its credit rating dealt a further blow to the rouble, though by Tuesday the currency had regained some ground against the dollar. The cost of insuring exposure to Russia's debt rose after Standard & Poor's cut Russia's sovereign credit rating to 'junk' late on Monday, citing weakened economic growth prospects and Western sanctions over Ukraine. The euro rose for a second day against the dollar. The single currency climbed to $1.1369, up 1.2 percent on the day, moving further away from an 11-year low of $1.1098 hit early on Monday after it became clear that Greece had voted in a new anti-bailout government.","U.S. stocks closed more than 1 percent lower on Tuesday and the blue-chip average closed 291 points down .

"A historic New Orleans cemetery that may have started New Orleans' tradition of above-ground crypts will soon be off-limits to tourists on their own because of repeated vandalism among the tombs, the Roman Catholic archdiocese that owns the property has announced. Starting in March, entry to St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 and its labyrinth of mausoleums will be restricted to the relatives of the dead buried there and to tourists whose guide is registered with the Archdiocese of New Orleans. 'We've had unlicensed tour guides and others handing out markers and instructions on how to mark up various tombs,' archdiocese spokeswoman Sarah McDonald said on Monday. St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 and its labyrinth of mausoleums will be off-limits to tourists on their own from March because of repeated vandalism among the tombs . Famous residents of the cemetery include former world chess champion Paul Morphy, left, and 19th Century voodoo priestess Marie Laveau, right . One of the most famous tombs, reputed to be the burial site of 19th Century voodoo priestess Marie Laveau, is repeatedly marked with Xs and, in late 2013, was covered from one end to the other with pink latex paint. 'We also have people leaving trash in the cemetery, littering, setting up camp in the cemetery,' she said in an interview. Established in 1789, the cemetery surrounded by 10-foot-high brick walls is the oldest remaining graveyard in this city beside the Mississippi River, which has grown into a Deep South tourist destination renowned for Mardi Gras, jazz, Cajun cuisine and the sometimes elaborate mausoleums that make its cemeteries known as 'cities of the dead.' Early burials in St. Louis No. 1 are thought to have been below ground or in low tombs that held a single coffin partly above ground, according to the website for Save Our Cemeteries, a cemetery restoration nonprofit. Concrete and marble burial vaults, experts believe, were built on top of those earlier graves tombs to accommodate later burials. All told, St. Louis No. 1 covers an entire city block with 'a maze of tombs and aisles,' the organization notes. A tourist  prays at the reputed tomb of Marie Laveau in St. Louis Cemetery No. 1, in New Orleans. Vandalism encouraged by unlicensed guides is prompting a new rule for New Orleans' oldest standing cemetery. Tourists touch the tomb of Voodoo queen Marie Laveau after someone painted it with pink latex paint in late 2013 . Those include walls of 'oven vaults' for people who could not afford stand-alone mausoleums and elaborate tombs for members of various societies. The thousands of people buried in the cemetery include Homer Plessy, who was the plaintiff in Plessy v Ferguson, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregation laws were constitutional; the first mayor of New Orleans, Etienne de Bore; and world chess champion Paul Morphy. Sherri Peppo, director of the archdiocesan cemeteries office, said in a news release Monday that several tombs have been broken into and vandalized in the past year. The statement said even security cameras were stolen. Complicating matters, a local legend has it that the voodoo priestess Laveau will grant a wish for someone who makes an X on the tomb believed to be hers, turns around three times, knocks on the tomb and shouts the wish. 'We needed to take some steps to protect both the sacred nature of the cemetery and preserve the history that is there as well,' Peppo said. A local legend has it that the voodoo priestess Laveau will grant a wish for someone who makes an X on the tomb believed to be hers, turns around three times, knocks on the tomb and shouts the wish . Tour guide Nathan Scott tells the tale of Marie Laveau while guiding tourists past her reputed tomb in St. Louis Cemetery No. 1, in New Orleans . Registration for tour guides will begin in February, the archdiocese said. Tour companies and independent guides must show insurance and a city license. Guides who occasionally bring tours to the cemetery can pay $40 for a one-time pass; those giving regular tours must pay the archdiocese a registration fee of $4,500 to $5,400 a year. The lower amount is for those paying once a year. Both policy and fees are reasonable, said Amanda Walker, director of Save Our Cemeteries, which gives tours of St. Louis cemeteries 1 and 2 and Lafayette Cemetery No. 1 to raise money for restoration of the tombs. Her nonprofit has partnered with the archdiocese for years to hire security at the cemeteries. She noted that cemetery tours currently are being conducted by guides for 'pure profit.' 'None of the money goes to the cemetery,' she noted. McDonald said relatives of those buried in the cemetery are asked, meanwhile, to get in touch with the archdiocese to make entry arrangements — likewise for scholars and those conducting genealogical research. The new fees are expected to pay to staff the cemetery during business hours and take unspecified security measures that officials are declining to reveal.

"A woman has been ordered to stand trial on charges she stole a police cruiser and led officers on an 80 mph chase - all while her hands were cuffed behind her. Center Township police testified at Roxanne Rimer's preliminary hearing Monday that she was arrested after stealing earrings from a Kohl's store January 14. Police testified that a loss prevention officer detained the 27-year-old Rimer, who apparently gave a fake name and claimed to be a juvenile. Scroll down for video . Chase: Roxanne Rimer led officers on a nearly 10-mile chase, weaving in and out of traffic, before she crashed into a hillside and jumped out of the car, police said.  Rimer is seen handcuffed by officers in this photo from The Beaver County Times . Court proceedings: Rimer has been ordered to stand trial on charges including aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, fleeing and eluding police, and robbery . Before police could arrive, Rimer ran away and jumped into a car driven by her grandfather, police said. That car was pulled over moments later, and Rimer was removed, handcuffed and placed in the back seat of a police cruiser, screaming, 'Mommy! Mommy!' authorities said. Police don't believe the grandfather knew of the shoplifting allegation. Officers say while police were searching her grandfather's car, the thin Chippewa Township woman squeezed through an opening in a partition in the cruiser that wasn't latched and crawled into the front seat. Getaway: Officers say while police were searching her grandfather's car,  Rimer squeezed through an opening in a partition in the cruiser that wasn't latched and crawled into the front seat . Mystery: Toward the end of the footage, a woman's asks an off-camera individual 'Hello? Can you help me? Can you help me? Can you help me drive please?' as the car pauses . Escape: The car continues down on the road for a bit, before a woman is seen running in front of the car and off toward the side of the road . She zoomed off, smashing into her grandfather's car as she drove away, still handcuffed, police said. Rimer then led officers on a nearly 10-mile chase, weaving in and out of traffic, before she crashed into a hillside and jumped out of the car, police said. District Judge James DiBenedetto ordered her to stand trial on charges including aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, fleeing and eluding police, and robbery. Her attorney, Steven Valsamidis, argued against the aggravated assault charge - filed because of accusations the officers were endangered - because he said Rimer didn't intend to injure anyone and nobody was hurt. But the judge agreed with the prosecutor, who said Rimer put both the police and her grandfather at risk. 'She was going to get out of that situation at whatever the cost,' said Frank Martocci, assistant district attorney in Beaver County. Defense: Rimer's attorney argued against the aggravated assault charge — filed because of accusations the officers were endangered — because he said Rimer didn't intend to injure anyone and nobody was hurt .","Roxanne Rimer has been ordered to stand trial on charges she stole a police cruiser and led officers on an 80 mph chase .

"They were voted the biggest fashion faux pas of last year, but three young designers want 'meggings' - that's male leggings - to become a wardrobe staple this season. Luke Shipley, Joe Hollingworth and Tom Hunt have unveiled a range of meggings, called sTitch Leggings, which they hope will enable men to 'both look great and feel comfortable in leggings.' So convinced are the trio by their brainchild, which came about after they were forced to wear 'ill-fitting female leggings' to a themed party, that they pitched it on Dragon's Den on Sunday. Stylish? Meggings are the natural evolution from the skinny jean and the once widespread baggy jean, claim sTitch founders, (left to right) Joe Hollingworth, Tom Hunt and Luke Shiple, who are hoping to make the trousers into the next big fashion trend . Priced at £25, sTitch leggings are inspired by celebrities like Russell Brand and Justin Bieber, who both favour meggings for casual daytime wear. They come in an array of bright designs including rainbow-coloured diamonds and hot pink - and even come complete with back pockets for your valuables. The founders claim that they are the natural evolution from the skinny jean and the once widespread baggy jean. Writing on their website, the team say: 'We envision a day where men can wear what they want as opposed to what they should. 'To achieve this, we will strive to design and produce garments that liberate the modern man from conventional male fashion.' However, judging by their appearance before Duncan Bannatyne, Kelly Hoppen, Deborah Meaden, Piers Linney and Peter Jones, the world isn't quite ready for meggings. The idea for meggings came about after the trio were forced to wear 'ill-fitting female leggings' to a party . Priced at £25, sTitch leggings are available in an array of fun designs and even come complete with a back pocket to store your valuables . Deborah Meaden retorted: ‘Seriously, it’s a bet, isn’t it?', while Peter Jones forced the men to swear the pitch wasn’t actually a joke. Kelly Hoppen tweeted during the show saying: 'Is this a joke?' and 'I couldn't be more out if I tried'. All of the Dragons decided against investing the £20,000 requested and Peter Jones concluded by saying meggings were 'one of the most ridiculous ideas in the Den we’ve ever seen’. Speaking to MailOnline following their humiliating appearance on the show, the trio said: 'Six months, three auditions, weeks worth of preparation and rehearsing and we're finally stood in front of big Duncan staring us down, wearing leggings looking redder than the red carpet on Oscars night.' Duncan Bannatyne, Kelly Hoppen, Deborah Meaden, Piers Linney and Peter Jones weren't impressed with the meggings, which one man tests out whilst practicing yoga . 'Duncan said that men don't wear leggings in his gym. You've obviously not graced the gym floor in the past two years big man,' retorted the founders of sTitch leggings, who shared this snap of a man wearing their brand whilst working out . Not ones to take the criticism lying down, they added: 'Debra was the worst. She was the most insulting. 'These guys are so out of touch with the real world that they didn't get the product. 'Big Duncan's telling us that men don't wear leggings in his gym? You've obviously not graced the gym floor in the past two years, big man.' Despite getting turned away by the Dragons, the team have seen a large rise in traffic and social media interaction, including receiving a tweet from the National Lottery. Speaking about the future, they said: 'We will be expanding our range from nine designs by adding a further 12 and there is even talk of a completely new product before the year is out. 'Taking this into account, we  are on track to double our 2014 sales figures. 'With every new sale we add to our growing community of men in leggings around the world, this shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.' All of the Dragons decided against investing the £20,000 requested and Peter Jones, second from right, concluded by saying meggings were, 'one of the most ridiculous ideas in the Den we've ever seen' The Twittersphere didn't seem to be convinced by the fashion brand .

"She is one of the few women to survive Auschwitz, endured a brutal forced march and ended World War II in the hellish place that was Bergen-Belsen. But, as the world marks the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, Kitty Hart-Moxon says she has forgiven the people who almost killed her - and holds no grudges against the Germans. Hart-Moxon, now 88, says today's Germans shouldn't be held responsible for their forefather's crimes but worries that a repeat of the Nazi genocide could be repeated elsewhere. Scroll down for video . Forgiveness: Auschwitz survivor Kitty Hart-Moxon, 88, says she bears no grudges towards the Germans . 'I mix a lot with Germans now and I go to Germany all the time,' she explains. 'It’s a different generation,' said Hart-Moxon, speaking ahead of today's Holocaust Memorial Service, which will be screened on BBC2 this evening. 'Young Germans have got a guilt complex because they say, well they are, they are the children of the killers. 'But we always say, ""Look it doesn't matter if you’re the child of a killer, you are not responsible - you were not the killer. 'You have no guilt and you shouldn't be feel guilty because you didn't do anything. It was a personal choice and you cannot be responsible for what your parents did or your grandparents.' Hart-Moxon, who now lives in Harpenden in Hertfordshire, was born in the Polish city of Lublin and was just 13 when war broke out. After enduring unimaginable privations in Lublin Ghetto, the family attempted to escape to Russia in early 1941 but with the border closed, they were forced to travel back into Poland. Survivor: Hart-Moxon, pictured with her mother Rosa, was sent to Auschwitz aged 16 . Concern: Hart-Moxon says there is no guarantee that the Holocaust will not be repeated in future . While being sheltered by a priest named Father Krasowski, the family were able to obtain false permits and Hart-Moxon and her mother joined a transport of Poles being taken into Germany to work for the I.G.Farben factory in Bitterfeld. But a year after arriving, Hart-Moxon, her mother and 12 other Jews working at the factory were betrayed to the Gestapo and on the 2nd April 1943, she arrived at Auschwitz. Unusually, both Hart-Moxon and her mother were selected to work, with both given jobs stripping the dead and sorting their possessions at Auschwitz II Birkenau - the death camp part of the Auschwitz complex. 'I just remember never ending columns of people going in [to the crematoria] and never coming out,' remembers Hart-Moxon. 'We had no contact with people that were going to gas chamber. They were behind electric fencing and although they were not far away, they were too far too to recognise so you couldn't communicate with anyone that was passing by.' Hart-Moxon says even if they had been able to warn the columns of men, women and children of the fate in store for them, it wouldn't have made a huge amount of difference. As a child: Mrs Hart-Moxon (far right) is pictured with her family including brother Robert (second left) Crematorium IV: As well as dealing with the dead, Hart-Moxon worked in the women’s infirmary . Liberation: Auschwitz was liberated by the advancing Red Army, 70 years ago today . 'What were you going to tell them? Were you going to tell them they were now going to die? You wouldn’t have done them a favour telling them that would you? 'It was much better people didn't know then if they did know they were going to die. So no. it was never, never even in my thought to have warned people of what was going to happen. 'We couldn’t go and tell these people, ""Now you are going to die"" - that would have been a really cruel thing to have done and anyway, it was it was totally forbidden.' Despite the hardships and the constant threat of death, Hart-Moxon, who at one point succumbed to typhus, survived - as did her mother. But as the Red Army of Russia approached, the pair were 'evacuated' along with a group of 100 women and taken to a sub-camp of Gross Rosen in the town of Reichenbach, now Dzierżoniów in southern Poland, where they were put to work in the local Philips factory. Not long after, with the Red Army still advancing, Hart-Moxon and her mother were marched out of the camp along with 10,000 others. They were destined for a factory in Porta Westfalica in north-western Germany but the conditions on the march were so harsh, just 200 arrived. Haunting: The camp, including Auschwitz II Birkenau, has been preserved and is now a museum . Mark: Hart-Moxon had her tattoo removed after moving to Britain but kept it (pictured) along with her mother's . But with the Allies approaching from the west, Hart-Moxon's stint at the camp proved to be short-lived and once again, she and the other women were evacuated. Crammed into cattle cars, they eventually pulled up outside the notorious Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. But rather than being taken inside, the women were left to starve.'We were led to the big siding outside Belsen  and then at that rail junction stood dozens of trains, all full of people inside. 'Sealed - in cattle trucks - sealed in. you could hear some people crying and some you couldn’t hear anything at all. 'The train just stood at the siding and people were just left to die outside Belsen.' Just as it seemed her luck might finally have run out, a group of German soldiers took pity on the suffocating Jews and agreed to take them to a camp at Salzwedel, a subsidiary of the Neuengamme concentration camp. It was to prove the last stop before liberation for Hart-Moxon, who was freed along with 1,000 other women when the Americans arrived on the 29th April 1945. Hart-Moxon and her mother had survived but only just. Her father, as she later discovered, had been murdered by the Gestapo, while her brother Robert had been killed in the fighting. Final destination: For most of the people who arrived, Auschwitz Birkenau was their final destination . Selection: Hart-Moxon initially worked sorting the belongings of the people murdered in the gas chambers . Her grandmother, like 95,000 other Lublin Jews, had been murdered in the gas chambers of Bełżec. Despite the horror of her experiences, Hart-Moxon, who recently revisited Auschwitz with a pair of teenage girls, says she will continue to speak out about what happened. '[After the war], I vowed no matter what I was going to do in my life, I’ve got to make quite sure that people know what happened,' she says. 'It is a warning. We try and do this to protect future generations because we have no guarantee about what’s going to happen. 'Have we a guarantee that this cannot happen again? Who can give you this guarantee today? If you see what’s going on around the world, can you say, ""Oh no it can never happen?"" 'That is why I think it’s important for people to know what’s in store - to protect future generations at least. 'I believe it’s my duty to to say what I have witnessed.' Among the six Nazi vernichtungslager (extermination camps), Auschwitz holds a unique place thanks to its dual role as a concentration and work camp, and because of the especially large number of people murdered there. Although the majority of Jews from Hart-Moxon's native Lublin died at the Bełżec death camp, among them her grandmother, Auschwitz was the final destination for one in six of Europe's Jews as well as prisoners of war, gypsies and other groups deemed undesirable by the Nazis. The original camp, Auschwitz I, was built in 1940 to house Polish and Soviet prisoners, and continued to do so throughout the Nazi period, although Jews were also held in the camp from the start. Auschwitz II-Birkenau was built in 1941 and was designated a vernichtungslager by SS leader, Heinrich Himmler, the same year. One of the first death camps, gas chambers were pioneered at Auschwitz and replaced the unreliable gas van method, which saw small groups murdered using the carbon monoxide produced by the exhaust. The technology paved the way for a further five large camps: Chelmno, Sobibor, Bełżec, Majdanek and Treblinka, as well as two smaller camps, Sajmište in what is now Serbia and Maly Trostinets in Belarus. But of all the camps, none murdered as many as Auschwitz which, after mass transports of prisoners began in 1942, was able to ‘process’ 9,000 Jews a day at the peak of its operations. Among those who died at Auschwitz II-Birkenau were 400,000 Hungarians, 300,000 Poles, 69,000 French, 25,000 Belgians, 7,500 Italians and six British Jews from the Channel Islands. Of the 1.3 million murdered at Birkenau, 200,000 were children.","Kitty Hart-Moxon, now 88, was 16 when she was sent to Auschwitz .

"A pensioner was forced to spend £600 clearing his name after a tram fare dodger 50 years his junior fraudulently used his name and address on three separate occasions. Jim McMahon, 76, from Lydgate, Greater Manchester, endured months of stress and had to fork out for a solicitor after being falsely accused of dodging a fare on the Manchester tram network. It later emerged that an imposter - believed to be known to Mr McMahon - had been stopped three times in August last year, but had falsely given a name and address connected to Mr McMahon. Jim McMahon, 76 (pictured) from Lydgate, Greater Manchester, endured months of stress and had to fork out for a solicitor after being falsely accused of dodging fares on the Manchester tram network . He said: ‘All this stress has come on top of a recent hospital operation I have had and I really haven’t needed this on top of it all. ‘I intend to try to get some money back from Metrolink or Bury Magistrates for my inconvenience.' On all the occasions, the culprit had given McMahon's full name, alongside his daughter's address. He twice gave his date of birth as 1978 and once as 1988, despite the fact Mr McMahon was born in 1939. Afterwards, a fine notice was  sent to Mr McMahon, who proved that he did not live at the given address and that he was not travelling on the tram at the time. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), which is responsible for Metrolink, subsequently dropped two of the fines. But Mr McMahon was shocked when he received a letter at his daughter's address, summoning him to Bury Magistrates' Court over the third incident. When he contacted police to reiterate he was not the culprit, he was advised to write a letter to the court and Metrolink operator MRDL to explain. He expected the third fine to also be dropped. But the court case still went ahead and Mr McMahon was given a £310 fine in his absence. He said: 'Surely, the best thing for Metrolink to do, given that there were two other instances where my name had been falsely given, is to contact me to check before dragging me through the courts in a battle that has cost me close to £600. The fare dodger was stopped on three separate occasions while travelling on the Manchester tram network (pictured) and each time gave Mr McMahon's name . ‘When I have already made it clear that I do not live in this property, why is it my responsibility to prove I’m innocent once again?’ After that, Mr McMahon hired a solicitor who arranged for him to go to Oldham Magistrates' Court to appeal the conviction. But, during the hearing, Mr McMahon said he was not given a chance to explain what had happened. Instead, another hearing was arranged in which a trial date was due to be set. He said: ‘I had been told I had to go to Oldham Magistrates' Court where I had to wait for a full day before I was told to make a statutory declaration. ‘I wanted to explain why I wasn’t guilty. But they didn’t give me the chance.’ Mr McMahon decided not to go along to the next hearing, on the advice of his solicitor. It was only when he phoned the court afterwards, to find out which date had been set for his trial, that he was informed the case had been dropped. A spokesman for TfGM said the company had not been made aware of the fare-dodging allegation, connected to the third incident, until it had already gone to court. But Mr McMahon claims he informed the operator about all three incidents from the outset. He is also furious that the previous incidents of fraud were not taken into account. TfGM has not confirmed whether or not it has pursued the case in order to track down the true identity of the fare dodger. A TfGM spokesman said: ‘Two cases were withdrawn as soon as Mr McMahon contacted Metrolink’s operator MRDL and provided evidence. ‘However, in the third case, when a different date of birth was given by a fare dodger, no contact was made with MRDL until after it had been to court when Mr McMahon made a statutory declaration. ‘Had Mr McMahon contacted MRDL in good time, this case would also have been withdrawn immediately. The onus is on Mr McMahon to come to us.’ They later added: ‘In light of the repeated difficulties Mr McMahon has faced with fare dodgers using his details, MRDL has agreed to contact him directly if his details are given in the future.’ But Mr McMahon added: ‘Metrolink hasn’t been in touch to apologise for all the inconvenience that I have suffered.'","Jim McMahon, 76, from Lydgate, received three fine notices through post .

"Council members were sent ducking for cover after a gunman opened fire outside a city building in Minnesota yesterday evening. The suspect started shooting outside New Hope City Hall at about 7.15pm, moments after a swearing-in ceremony for two new officers had concluded. The newly sworn-in officers and others were leaving the city council chambers when they encountered a man who opened fire with a 'long gun'. After shots rang out at New Hope City Hall in Minnesota yesterday evening, members of the council were sent ducking for cover. Two police officers were struck and other officers  returned fire, killing the gunman .

Two New Hope police officers were struck and other officers immediately returned fire, killing the gunman. No one else was injured. Chief Deputy Mike Carlson with the Hennepin County Sheriff's Department did not identify the gunman or reveal a possible motive for the attack. Cable-access video of the scene inside the council chambers was posted to YouTube. In the video, council members take cover behind their desks as shots ring out. One man pulls out a handgun and tells his fellow council members to 'get down'. 'Get down! Everybody get down!' he says. 'If this is being taped, go to commercial, go away from this.' 'Somebody got shot,' another council member adds. Ducking for cover seemed like a good idea after the unnamed gunman began shooting on Monday night . The wounded officers are in good condition and are expected to survive. They have not been named and it is not clear if they were the newly sworn-in officers or veterans of the force. Authorities are continuing to investigate the incident, but they are not looking for any additional suspects. New Hope City Hall is across the street from a retirement community. 'To have it happen right across the street from our home, with police officers in parking lots with drawn guns, it's scary, very scary,' resident Linda Townsend told CBS Minnesota.","Shooting happened outside of New Hope City Hall in Minnesota last night .

"Astrologer Russell Grant (pictured) believes zodiac signs influence our supermarket shopping habits . From shopaholics to those who can't stand supermarkets - Britain's consumer habits may simply be the result of their star sign, according to an astrologer. Capricorns are canny and Scorpios are savvy because the way they buy their groceries is a reflection of their zodiac sign, claims stargazer and Strictly Come Dancing star Russell Grant. He says shopping habits are dictated by star signs, so those who are Aries are more likely to spend as little time as possible in a supermarket - compared to Taurus, who like to splash out on big name brands. Geminis fall for the adverts and buy things they don't need and Leos 'live for the sales', said the horoscope expert. Mr Grant claims the habits apply whether it is an Aries in Asda, a Sagitarrius in Sainsbury's or even a virtual Virgo ordering their deliveries online. So is he right? Here's what he believes your star sign says about your supermarket shopping habits: . ARIES: 'Not everyone enjoys food shopping. Aries won't hang around comparing brands and prices or reading labels. 'They'll just want to grab a trolley, get into the store and get out again in less than 30 minutes.' TAURUS: 'Taurus will pay extra for brands they trust. 'They have a shopping list they always use but can be picky shoppers so what begins as a quick trip to the supermarket can turn into a day's excursion.' Aries (pictured left) does not enjoy the food shop while Taurus (right) will pay extra for brands they trust . GEMINI: 'Geminis are easily pulled in by seductive advertising and nine times out of ten will end up buying things they don't need or want. 'They happily make use of self-service scanning and checkouts or ordering online to make food shopping easier.' CANCER: 'Shopping for the family feels good and meets the Cancerian's emotional needs. 'There's nothing they enjoy more than choosing food and household items while arranging their trolley so everything fits in neatly and nothing gets squashed.' Gemini (pictured left) is easily seduced by adverts while Cancer (right) enjoys nothing more than the food shop . LEO: 'Leo loves to shop and lives for the sales. There's always the option of shopping on-line but Leo would rather experience the sights, sounds and smells of the supermarket than have shopping delivered to their door.' VIRGO: 'From shopping trolleys with squeaky wheels to crowded aisles and long checkout queues Virgo can find plenty to complain about. They always using the same supermarket and know every product in every aisle to make navigating quick and simple.' Leo (pictured left) lives for the sales while Virgo (right) visits the same convenient supermarket every time . LIBRA: 'This is the shopper who stands for hours comparing 50 different types of cereal before deciding to opt for yoghurt instead. Spend hours checking sell-by dates on every item. Even picking the right lane at the checkout can be a major dilemma.' SCORPIO: 'Scorpio won't be tricked into buying something they don't need just because it's on sale. Scorpio will have worked out the best times to shop so as to cut time wasted finding a parking space and walking around the store.' Libra (pictured left) is dithering and indecisive while Scorpio (right) is a savvy shopper in every sense . SAGITTARIUS: 'Sagittarius finds any excuse to postpone food shopping. Once in the supermarket, they'll do anything to speed up the process including pinching ideas from another shopper's trolley rather than searching shelves to find an item.' CAPRICORN: 'They have grocery shopping perfected into an efficient, streamlined process. Even at the checkout they will load items onto the conveyor belt in baggable order only to then hold up the queue by producing a discount coupon for every item.' Sagittarius (pictured left) finds any excuse to avoid the shop while Capricorn (right) makes it look like an art . AQUARIUS: 'Little and often will be Aquarian's likely shopping style or better still they will click and collect or shop online and probably haven't touched a trolley in years.' PISCES: 'Pisces can't resist a bargain and will stock up on anything that's on sale whether or not they need it. Because they would hate to hurt a salesperson's feelings they can be easily talked into making purchases.' Aquarius (pictured left) prefers to shop online while Pisces (right) can't resist a supermarket bargain . Mr Grant claims habits apply whether it is an Aries in Asda, a Taurus in Tesco or a Sagitarrius in Sainsbury's .","Astrologer Russell Grant claims way people shop is influenced by signs .

"President Barack Obama spoke to an appreciative yet polite audience of about 1,500 young Indians in New Delhi on Tuesday morning, but his White House tech team delivered a 'facepalm' moment to the handful of people who watched online. As he praised India and the United States for a string of technological achievements, his satellite video feed cut out for a full ten seconds. 'As societies that celebrate knowledge and innovation,' Obama boasted, we transformed ourselves into high-tech –' 'High tech' glitch: Obama's video feed went out six times during his speech on Tuesday in New Delhi, including a ten-second gap just as he was praising both the US and India for 'high-tech' advancements . United front: Obama walked from the stage with first lady Michelle Obama after delivering a speech at the Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi that included a passionate defense of women's rights . Not a 'secret Muslim': Obama himself brought up accusations in some US corners that he's not a Christian as he claims – 'as if that were somehow a bad thing' That's all people watching on the White House's website and on YouTube heard until a series of buzzes and clicks gave way to the president talking about 'outer space' and crediting both nations for going 'to the moon and to Mars.' The bulk of Obama's 35-minute speech touched on other issues, though, including nuclear energy, climate change, religious freedom and civil rights. 'There were moments in my life where I've been treated differently because of the color of my skin,' the president said. And he brought up and dismissed the persistent rumors spread by far-right conservatives that he's secretly a Muslim . 'There have been times where my faith has at times been questioned by people who don't know me,' Obama told his audience, 'or they've said that I adhere to a different religion – as if that were somehow a bad thing.' Nearly 80 per cent of Indians are Hindu, with Muslims the largest religious minority at 12 per cent. Big stage: President Barack Obama speaks at the Siri Fort Auditorium in, New Delhi, India, on Tuesday . Warm climate: Obama's crowd of young Indians was polite and appreciative as he urged them to demand climate-change policy shifts to benefit their generation . Small crowd online:  YouTube's on-screen counter showed a peak of just 662 online viewers for Obama's speech in New Delhi although it was only 9:30 p.m. on the West Coast when he began . Give the people what they want: The president had more than 84,000 viewers when YouTube 'stars' GloZell Green (front left), Hank Green (back left) and Bethany Mota (right) interviewed him at the White House . Obama made a point of announcing that he and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reached agreement on the terms of a nuclear energy deal, unlocking potentially billions of dollars in trade from U.S. companies who will be free to supply India with nuclear components and technology, andto build reactors there. A dispute over legal liability in the case of an accident had kept the U.S. from allowing those commercial transactions. That has been solved, and Obama has reportedly gained assurances that nuclear material transferred to India will be tracked carefully and accounted for. 'With the breakthroughs we achieved on this visit, we can finally move toward fully implementing our civil nuclear agreement,' Obama said Tuesday morning, 'which will mean more reliable electricity for Indians and cleaner, non-carbon energy that helps fight climate change.' But the president underscored his commitment to green-lighting nuclear energy deals only where there is no possibility of weapons development. 'Even as we acknowledge the world as it is, we must never stop working for the world as it should be – a world without nuclear weapons. That should be a goal for all of us,' he said. His biggest push was for a push for new Indian commitments on climate change, an issue already on India's front-burner. 'With rising seas, melting Himalayan glaciers, more unpredictable monsoons, [and] cyclones getting stronger, few countries will be more affected by a warmer planet than India,' Obama said. 'Now the United States recognizes our part in creating this problem, so we're leading the global effort to combat it. And today I can say that America's carbon pollution is near its lowest level in almost two decades.' Mobbed: Obama was greeted by a crush of fans – and their cellphone cameras – after his speech on Tuesday in New Delhi . But 'even if countries like the United States curb our emissions,' Obama warned, 'if countries that are growing rapidly like India, with soaring energy needs, don't also embrace cleaner fuels, then we don't stand a chance against climate change.' The video glitches – and the rest of Obama's speech – were seen by few Americans. At its peak, just 662 people were viewing the YouTube stream that powers livestreams at WhiteHouse.gov. By comparison, slightly more than 84,000 tuned in last week to see him interviewed by three YouTube 'celebrities' including GloZell Green, a woman known for eating out of a bathtub filled with milk and Fruit Loops cereal while sitting in it. Obama was introduced by Neha Buch, 33,the CEO of Pravah, a Delhi-based organization that promotes active citizenship and social enterprise for young Indians. 'She lobbies the Government of India on policies affecting the youth,' according to a White House pool reporter, 'and has worked with different U.N. agencies to strengthen their youth-centered work.' ' Most recently, she was involved in the post-2015 Development Agenda consultation process in India as a co-convener of the ""Youth Tract"" for post-2015.' The president followed his speech in New Delhi with a sit-down television interview conducted by CNN host Fareed Zakaria.","'We transformed ourselves into high-tech–' Obama said just before the video signal dropped for ten full seconds .

"Saudi Arabia has carried out its first execution under the rule of newly enthroned King Salman, with the beheading of a convicted serial rapist. Moussa al-Zahrani, 45, had been found guilty of 'luring underage girls, intoxicating them, forcing them to watch pornographic videos and then physically and sexually assaulting them', an Interior Ministry statement said. The beheading, which took place in Jeddah, has caused outrage on social media after al-Zahrani, an Arabic teacher, maintained his innocence, and claimed he had been framed by police. First beheading: Moussa al-Zahrani is the first person to be executed under the reign of Saudi Arabia's new King Salman, pictured meeting Prime Minister David Cameron on Sunday . Al-Zahrani, a father-of-six, was found guilty of assaulting young girls  a string of attacks in Jeddah in 2011. He maintained his innocence throughout the trial and two later appeals, and last year, al-Zahrani appealed in a 20-minute video for the late  King Abdullah to intervene. The video, which was spread on social media in Saudi Arabia, saw al-Zahrani claim that he was being framed by police and that one of his accusers, his neighbour of ten years was also a police investigator in the case. An Arabic hashtag on Twitter, 'We are all Moussa al-Zahrani' garnered thousands of comments by Saudis with conflicting opinions over the case. Al-Zahrani's relatives have appeared on Saudi talk shows, saying the case was riddled with inconsistencies and that the judiciary did not weigh all the evidence. Brutal: The execution of Moussa al-Zahrani this week follows the public beheading of a woman which was filmed in secret and leaked online (pictured) They claimed a medical report found the neighbour's ten-year-old daughter had not been assaulted and that several cases of assault against young girls took place in Jeddah while al-Zahrani was already jailed. Speaking after the execution, his brother, Hassan al-Zahrani said hat his brother could not have committed the crimes he was convicted of. Al-Zahrani was one of 11 people beheaded in Saudi Arabia so far this year. Saudi Arabia executed 87 people last year, up from 78 in 2013. The execution of al-Zahrani follows the public beheading of a woman which was filmed in secret and leaked online. Layla bint Abdul Mutaleb Bassim, convicted of raping and murdering her six-year-old stepdaughter, was heard screaming her innocence in graphic footage of the execution. An aerial view shows the holy city of Mecca: Bassim was one of 10 people beheaded In Saudi Arabia so far this year. Saudi Arabia executed 87 people last year, up from 78 in 2013 . The incident sparked outrage in Saudi Arabia, but not  because of the beheading, but rather that the execution was filmed and posted online, where the woman's family might see it. Saudi Arabia, which has one of the highest execution rates in the world, follows a strict interpretation of Islamic law and applies the death penalty for crimes such as murder, rape and witchcraft. The kingdom had the third-highest number of recorded executions in 2013, behind Iran and Iraq, Amnesty International says. A United Nations special rapporteur has said trials leading to the death penalty in Saudi Arabia are 'grossly unfair'. Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking are punishable by death in the oil-rich Gulf state, which is a close ally of Washington and a regular customer of both American and British arms companies.","Moussa al-Zahrani executed for raping several girls in Saudi Arabia .

"Dr Richard Smith, a kidney consultant, started up an affair with a patient after he saw her undress . A kidney specialist began a secret affair with his patient saying he ‘couldn’t get her out of his head’ after she undressed in his examination room, a tribunal heard. Dr Richard Smith, 53, became infatuated with the married woman after he asked her to take off her top so he could look at a rash on her back. A consultant in renal medicine, he began exchanging flirtatious text messages with his patient before they eventually became lovers, meeting in hotel rooms across the UK. The woman, a diabetic who had a kidney transplant in 2011, was under the care of the Oxford and Cambridge-educated doctor at Southmead Hospital, Bristol. But a tribunal in Manchester heard that despite their relationship, married Dr Smith continued treating the woman, named only as Patient A. He faces a fitness to practice tribunal and could be struck off if misconduct is proved. Ciaran Rankin, for the General Medical Council, told the hearing: ‘Patient A felt the relationship between herself and the doctor changed following a particular visit she had made in relation to a rash. ‘The appointment, in the company of her husband, meant she had to take her top off. ‘On the next occasion when she visited she was approached by the doctor and he asked her to come into his consultation room. 'Once there he described to Patient A that he couldn’t get the image of her out of his mind, which left her feeling flattered.’ Mr Rankin said the pair called and texted each other, and later met in the lobby of a hotel. Patient A had been under the care of Dr Richard Smith at Southmead Hospital in Bristol since 2008 . They discussed their unhappiness at home and eventually kissed, the tribunal heard. After sleeping together for the first time in a Travelodge outside Bristol, the pair went on to meet up in Cardiff, Newcastle, Oxford and London. The tribunal heard the eight-month affair, which began in February 2012, only came to light after the patient’s husband became suspicious. Once the hospital launched an investigation, Dr Smith and his wife tried to convince Patient A to keep quiet, it was alleged. Dr Smith admitted the sexual relationship and denied asking the woman to stay silent. His contract with the NHS Trust was terminated in May 2013. The hearing continues.","Dr Richard Smith was a renal medicine consultant at Southmead Hospital .

"An attorney for Django Unchained actress Daniele Watts and her boyfriend has entered not guilty pleas on their behalf to misdemeanor lewd conduct charges. Watts, 29, claimed that police accused her of being a prostitute when she was arrested in Los Angeles in September with Brian Lucas. Attorney Lou Shapiro entered the pleas at a brief hearing Tuesday in Los Angeles. Scroll down for audio . An attorney for Django Unchained actress Daniele Watts and her boyfriend (pictured in December)  has entered not guilty pleas on their behalf to misdemeanor lewd conduct charges.  Watts, 29, claimed that police accused her of being a prostitute when she was arrested in Los Angeles in September with Brian Lucas . Watts and Lucas found themselves at the center of a national controversy on September 11 when she claimed that the LAPD arrested her because she was a prostitute after her and Lucas were caught involved in an amorous clinch in broad daylight. She claimed the police were heavy-handed and left her 'wrist bleeding in pain' and claimed the whole affair left her humiliated. Lucas took to Facebook to specifically claim the LAPD arrested them because they assumed his girlfriend was a prostitute because they saw an interracial couple. Watts (right) insisted she was just kissing her boyfriend in the car . A recording of the arrest by one of the officers involved showed that Watts accused the police of racism when she refused to produce ID after a series of 911 calls from witnesses claiming a couple was having sex in their car. 'Do you know how many times the cops have been called just for being black? Just because I am black and he's white? I'm just being really honest,' she said to LAPD Sgt. Jim Parker. In the recording Watts exclaims 'You are not the one who is in handcuffs' 'You're not the one who's spent your life being called a n----- and growing up in the south, and now I get the cops called on me. An eyewitness in a nearby offfice building said Lucas was sitting in the passenger seat with his feet on the curb and Watts was straddling him and rocking back and forth . Pictures obtained by TMZ show Daniele Watts straddling her boyfriend Brian James Lucas in his car while the couple steady themselves with their hands on the car sunroof . 'The cop pulled us over because he thought I was a prostitute.' Parker later said in an interview with the MailOnline that he thought it was incorrect for Watts to accuse him and the other two officers of prejudice because he is gay and the other two police were a woman and a Latino. Parker said he released the audio in an attempt so show that he was simply responding to a 911 calls that told the dispatcher Watts and Lucas were having sex with the door open and was reasonable during their encounter. He also added that it was Watts' attitude and uncooperative nature that caused her to be arrested. In the immediate aftermath, prominent civil rights leaders took up Watts' cause, but then asked her to apologize when the audio and pictures showing Watts sitting on top of Lucas inside his car were made public. Sgt. Jim Parker, a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, says he is speaking out because he's seen the department become dramatically more sensitive since he's been on the force . However, Watts and Lucas, who could face six months in jail have refused to apologize. 'I think there was a lot of personal risk involved for me to decide to even make that Facebook post,' Watts said, according to theNew York Daily News. 'I wouldn't have made that Facebook statement if I didn't believe this was an issue that deserves our national conversation and attention. 'And racial conflict is something that a lot of people don't want to talk about, because it's uncomfortable, but if I'm in a position where people are listening, I'm going to lend my voice to it. 'I believe conversations can help us move through these difficult things.'","Attorney Lou Shapiro entered the pleas at a brief hearing Tuesday in LA .

"The Chancellor was snapped with his finger just visible below his belt while he sniffed a bottle of freshly-pressed cider in Somerset yesterday . There is still 100 days to go before the election – but George Osborne is unlikely to be caught in a more embarrassing pose all campaign. The Chancellor was snapped with his finger just visible below his belt while he sniffed a bottle of freshly-pressed cider in Somerset yesterday. The unfortunate image was taken during a day of photo-ops on a tour of the South West. Mr Osborne started the day by setting sail on a fishing boat in Cornwall where he posed holding crabs. He smiled gleefully as he held up two spider crabs, before tweeting a picture with the caption: ‘Started day in Newquay with Cornish fisherman Phil who's been crab fishing here for 40 years.’ The Chancellor, however, appeared not to have noticed the boat was perhaps unfortunately named ‘Reaper’. He then joined the Prime Minister for a carpentry class in Somerset, before they both helped make cider. Mr Osborne, who has developed a reputation for his regular photo opportunities wearing a hi-viz jacket, joined the Prime Minister making cider in front of the cameras dressed in a fleece jumper. As he took the lead picking up a crate of apples to pour into a machine, Mr Cameron appeared not to want to be left out and hastily asked ‘do you want a hand?’ before taking some of the weight with his hands. When someone appeared to question whether it was safe, Mr Cameron quickly replied: ‘Health and safety? We’ll be alright’, before saying to Mr Osborne: ‘Come on then’ and tipping the apples into the press. After pouring a couple of crates of apples into the machine, the pair tried their hand at bottling the drink. Mr Cameron lifted a bottle to his nose remarking ‘Oh that smells very good’, before adding ‘I’ll try some in a minute’. During the whistle-stop tour of marginal South West constituencies, which is a key battleground with the Lib Dems, Mr Osborne said the region had never received the same ‘political attention’ lavished on regenerating the north of England. Mr Osborne, who has developed a reputation for his regular photo opportunities wearing a hi-viz jacket, joined the Prime Minister making cider in front of the cameras dressed in a fleece jumper . He pledged that the Tories would create more than 150,000 jobs and boost the region’s economy by £6.4 billion, adding: ‘The future is bright in the West.’ ‘Our long term plan for the South West is about recognising the value of both its natural beauty and the economic strengths nurtured by the people who live here,’ he said. The Chancellor refused to say if he was considering reducing the tax on cider, as he has on beer. Mr Osborne told reporters: ‘I won’t give a budget here in Somerset, but we did freeze cider last time,’ adding that Conservatives would ensure that the industry is not ‘clobbered’. The Chancellor joined David Cameron emptying apples into a machine that presses them for cider making at Hecks Cider Farm, Street, Somerset . Earlier Mr Osborne helped with an engineering project in a mechanical workshop class during their visit to Somerset College, Taunton . Mr Osborne reiterated that the South West could be the equivalent of the thriving west coast of the US as he launched the ‘long-term’ economic plan. Mr Osborne went on to draw comparisons between the South West and the US west coast: ‘The west coast has the landscape, the sea, the unique characteristics that makes it a great place to live and visit. ‘But it has also built a formidable, world-class reputation in science, technology and universities. And the military bases and defence industry have helped to create powerful clusters from Silicon Valley to southern California.’ The Chancellor followed in a long line of ministers and political leaders who have seen their careers tarnished by an unfortunate photograph after posing with his finger pointing out from his crotch. Ed Miliband, William Hague and Gordon Brown have all been caught in bizarre poses. Mr Miliband's brother David saw his leadership ambitions badly damaged after being snapped waving a a banana in 2008. This is the unfortunate moment a grinning Ed Miliband was caught posing with three students making a hand gesture more common with builders . David Cameron has also suffered his fair share of embarrassing pictures - including images of him without a shirt, wrapped in a Disney towel. His credentials as a fit and athletic political leader also took a hit after pictures emerged of him drenched in sweat on a jog near Downing Street. Labour leader Ed Miliband was widely mocked after being snapped awkwardly eating a bacon sandwich in  Covent Garden last year . Conservative leader William Hague pictured with a pair of horns seeming to come from his head . David Cameron was pictured out for a run in out of the back of Downing Street in February last year . The then Prime Minister Gordon Brown unfortunately placed in front of a sign reading 'Britain' Even slick PR operators like Tony Blair have been caught in pictures which they wished they hadn't .","Chancellor was snapped with  finger just visible below his belt yesterday .

"Parents with students at one California high school recently learned that two Planned Parenthood employees who taught their impressionable children sex education also held down some controversial side jobs. One of the sex-ed instructors at Acalanes Union High School in Lafayette also taught a class on sex toys at a nearby shop while the other identified herself as a 'pleasure activist' on her now-deleted Twitter profile. The job history of the two teachers was revealed after parents learned about the school's partnership with Planned Parenthood and demanded the curriculum be changed. Some of the parents felt that Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides complimentary reproductive and women's health services, was actually encouraging their children to start having sex. Two Planned Parenthood workers who taught sex-education at Acalanes High School in Lafayette, California are being criticized for their controversial side jobs. Neither are employed by the school anymore . 'Planned Parenthood is a business. It's a business that sells sex. It's a way to get clientele and to sexualize young people and turn them into lifelong clients,' parent Camille Giglio told CBS San Francisco in November. The unhappy parents then partnered with conservative legal group the Pacific Justice Institute to petition for a new sex-ed curriculum. In the course of their fight with the school, the career histories of the Planned Parenthood instructors were revealed and two of the teachers raised even more concerns to parents. One of the instructors teaches a 'pleasure' workshop at a store called Good Vibrations in nearby Berkeley, which sells sex toys. Meanwhile, one of the other instructors had described herself as a 'pleasure activist' on Twitter, and mentioned attending CatalystCon, a sexuality conference. 'These are two representatives (who) happen to have a truly questionable background,' Brad Dacus of the Pacific Justice Institute, which made the initial inquiry with concerned parents, told FoxNews.com. 'There has been outcry from the parents. This school district doesn't seem to get it when it comes to the proper protection for the students.' Dacus says the two instructors are no longer teaching at the high school, but it's unclear who will replace them. 'They announced that they would not be continuing, but they haven't said who would be teaching the students in the future,' he said. 'This school has continually displayed a lack of accountability. 'The two other schools in the district have chosen not to use Planned Parenthood and they are not having any problems.' The school previously released a statement defending their use of Planned Parenthood, a group they have worked with for more than a decade. 'The instruction is age-appropriate using objective and medically accurate information. The value of abstinence is emphasized as it is identified as the only certain way to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection. We believe the instruction builds student skills for making and implementing responsible decisions about sexuality…Parents are given prior notification of the presentation, the topics to be covered, and informed that a Planned Parenthood educator will be presenting to the students. Parents are able to opt their students out from the instruction.'",Jobs of two of the sex-ed teachers were revealed after parents boycotted Planned Parenthood curriculum at Acalanes Union High School .

"Plagued by a hacking cough and persistent bouts of pneumonia, doctors urged Jamie Roper to undergo medical tests. The 46-year-old was showing the classic symptoms of lung cancer. But he was adamant, he would not have a biopsy until he had married his bride-to-be Jen, 30. After returning from the Mediterranean, where the couple tied the knot aboard a cruise ship, tests confirmed doctors' fears. Mr Roper was suffering lung cancer. Six weeks after marrying his new wife, he passed away in her arms, his last words to her, 'I love you.' Jamie Roper, 46, died six weeks after marrying his wife Jen on board a cruise ship in the Mediterranean. He had delayed a biopsy test to detect lung cancer, adamant he wouldn't let it get in the way of their wedding . Two weeks after returning from their holiday, tests revealed Mr Roper did have lung cancer, after he had been suffering a hacking cough and persistent bouts of pneumonia . Mrs Roper, from Long Stratton in Norfolk, today urged others not to delay vital tests. 'We were always hopeful that he'd be all right then I realised it was not to be,' she said. 'In the run-up to the wedding Jamie was in and out of the doctors. 'He had felt poorly for a month, but we didn't think it was serious. We weren't worried. 'He was told he had a chest infection, then pneumonia and he went for scans. 'Then in September - on the day before my final dress fitting - Jamie was told that he might have lung cancer. 'We were told he would need more biopsies to confirm this but we decided to stay positive. 'We decided to delay the tests and get married. We hoped that we'd get a few years together at the very least.' In October 2011, the couple drove to Southampton to board the cruise ship on which they were married. 'It was lovely,' Mrs Roper, who met her husband two years earlier at work, remembered. 'But all the time I thought something might be wrong. As we said the words ""in sickness and in health"", it really hit home.' The couple made the most of their fortnight away. 'Jamie struggled with his breathing but otherwise we had an amazing time,' she said. 'But a cloud hung over us.' A fortnight after they returned home Mr Roper went to Norfolk and Norwich Hospital for a biopsy. Six weeks after their wedding, while in the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, Mr Roper passed away in his wife's arms, his last words to her, 'I love you' Mrs Roper today urged people not to delay medical tests as her husband did. She said: 'We were always hopeful that he'd be all right then I realised it was not to be' He was kept in hospital because of complications and after 10 days allowed home. Two days later – a month after they'd returned from their wedding – he was diagnosed with lung cancer and returned to hospital. Lung cancer is one of the most common and most serious types of cancer. More than 41,000 people are diagnosed with the condition each year in the UK. Many people will see no signs or symptoms in the early stages, but as the disease progresses some symptoms develop, including: . - a persistent cough . - coughing up blood . - persistent breathlessness . - unexplained tiredness and weight loss . - an ache or pain when breathing or coughing . Source: NHS Choices . Mrs Roper said: 'Surgeons confirmed he had lung cancer and a tear in his bowel, which he would need surgery for. 'He had surgery straight away but afterwards his heart rate picked up and he started gasping for breath. 'I was told that before the surgery Jamie had been asked if his lungs failed if he wanted to be resuscitated. 'He'd said no. 'I told him I loved him and he tried to say it back but didn't get the words out.' He died in his wife's arms on November 29, 2011. After his funeral that December Mrs Roper struggled to cope and kept a note he had written her, pinned to the fridge for months. It read: 'Hi honey I bloody love you!! Xxxx.' She read it over and over again and when it started fading she decided to have the words tattooed on her left hip. She also had a ring made, containing some of his ashes and the words, 'Love you forever', engraved on the band. She said: 'They were the words Jamie used to sign off every text.'","Jamie Roper, 46, put off having a biopsy to marry his fiance Jen, 30 .

"Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, has been criticized over plans to launch a state-run and tax-payer funded news outlet next month. The governor, who is considering a run for the White House in 2016, is to start Just IN, a website with stories and news releases written by state press secretaries, the Indianapolis Star reported. It will be overseen by Bill McCleery, a former Indy Star reporter. Indiana Governor Mike Pence has been criticized over plans to launch a state-run and tax-payer funded news outlet next month . Indiana columnists Tim Swarens and Matthew Tully have come out criticizing the move with one labeling it as a propaganda outlet and the other calling for Pence to cancel the plans. Tully said that Pence is a politician trying to gain more control over what the public reads about him and what he does. Swarens called on Pence to pull the plug on the 'horrible, terrible, really no-good idea'. Pence's media venture will feature personality profiles as well as straight news and feature stories. It also has plans to break news ahead of other media outlets, and pitch stories to reporters . Fellow journalist John Russell took his frustration out on Twitter asking for every professional journalist in Indiana to denounce the governor's state-run news service. Publisher of a small newspaper in Portland, Indiana, Jack Ronald, told the Indy Star that the idea of elected officials presenting material that will unavoidably have a pro-administration point of view is contradictory to the idea of an independent press. Pence's media venture is to feature personality profiles as well as straight-forward news and feature stories. It also has plans to break news ahead of other media outlets, and pitch stories to reporters and the public, according to Just IN documents. Just IN will also include stories written by state communication directors and will operate as news outlet in 'its own right'. Pence, who has been serving as governor since 2013 posted to social media site Twitter about the new media outlet. He wrote: 'This is state of IN's calendar for press releases: The #JustIN website will offer the same service with a new look'. Following a search of state employee salary data, the outlet already has two staff members who have a combined salary of $100,000, according to the Indy Star.","Mike Pence has been criticized over plans to launch a tax-payer funded news outlet next month .

"A Russian banker went on a gun rampage, shooting dead three of his colleagues then blowing himself up with a grenade, it has been reported. The man, an official of the Russian Central Bank in the far east city of Blagoveshchensk, mowed down two women and one man at the bank's offices before committing suicide, a spokesman for the region's investigative committee, Alexei Lubinsky, told Interfax news agency. Russia's LifeNews website reported that the shooter, a man named Vladimir Levkin, was motivated by revenge after his colleagues voted to fire him as part of the bank's policy to lay off some of its staff. A Russian banker went on a gun rampage in the far east city of Blagoveshchensk (file picture), killing three colleagues before taking his own life . The report said Levkin used a hunting rifle to commit the murders. An eyewitness described how he then took his own life with an explosive device. A bank employee told Komsomolskaya Pravda: 'We have reorganization [in the bank], we are having our staff reduced. And the guy has a paralyzed child and a non-working wife. 'Where did he take the rifle from? He killed people and then blew himself up with a grenade. This is horrible.' Police will try to determine how the banker managed to smuggle the gun into the bank (file picture), which was considered to be well-protected . One female victim was a deputy head of department, the other a head of a bank branch, while the male was head of bank management, according to Russia Today. Russia's Central Bank head office in Moscow confirmed to AFP in an emailed comment that a 'terrible tragedy' had occurred and offered condolences to the families of the slain employees. 'We consider what happened in Blagoveshchensk to have been a terrible tragedy,' first deputy chairman Georgy Luntovsky said in the statement. 'Right now security officials are working at the scene to determine all of the circumstances,' he said. Police will try to determine how the banker managed to smuggle the gun into the bank, which is considered to be secure.","Russian banker in Blagoveshchensk went on killing spree after being fired .

"Scores of health-conscious New Yorkers panicked as the dark clouds of storm Juno loomed ominously over Manhattan. But far from being worried about having enough blankets, candles and tinned soup to outlast the blizzard, they appeared to be more concerned about stocking up on a frilly green vegetable.

Shelves in Whole Foods stores have been stripped of kale, which is extremely popular in New York . The cousin of wild cabbage has become a hipster must-have, particularly in healthy green smoothies . Shreds of the nutrient-packed superfood are all that are left in many grocery outlets in the city . More deserted shelves at a Whole Foods store, where kale is popular even without the threat of a blizzard . New Yorkers have been rushing to grocery stores to stock up on essentials amid the heavy snow . Residents of the five boroughs tweeted their concern about the shortage of kale, posting images of store aisles bare but for a few remaining shreds of green where piles of the popular vegetable once stood. Some joked of an impending 'Kale-pocalypse' with not a trace of the health food to be found. Queues at grocery outlets in the city stretched round the block as residents rushed to stock up before the worst of Juno was set to hit. The full fury of the storm was expected to strike at 11pm yesterday but the severe weather conditions which were forecast failed to materialize. New Yorkers turned the streets of Manhattan into a playground last night as road and travel bans virtually emptied the streets. They were captured having snowball fights in an almost deserted Times Square while others stood in the middle of the street to take pictures.

Metro systems in New York City and Boston shut down and there were threats of $500 fines for drivers on roads barred in the evening to all but emergency vehicles. A fifth of the population of the U.S. was advised to shelter from the storm, with a large swath of New York state, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts forced from the roads by driving bans to make room for plows, police and ambulances.","Stores were cleaned out of the nutrient-packed frilly green vegetable .

"The haka is an emotive and spine-tingling performance on the rugby field when the New Zealand rugby team face-off against their opposition. But in this incredible video, those feelings are ramped up yet further as soldiers of 2/1 RNZIR Battalion perform their Unit Haka, powerfully acknowledging the lives and feats of their fallen comrades as they come onto the Unit's parade ground. It is also an emotive farewell for they will leave via the waharoa (the carved entrance way) for the very last time. Used as an indicator of emotion, the haka is a perfect way to remember and salute fallen soldiers . As the family of a fallen soldier walk behind a hearse, the soldiers move forwards to greet the entourage before the Maori tradition begins. The performance is mind-blowing, each soldier seems like they know their role in the formation, whether it be barking the orders from the front, or circling the car from the side. The video was shot in 2012, but has recently emerged and shows the importance of the haka in the military. The hearse approaches and the family follow behind as they get set for a very special greeting . The soldiers from 2/1 RNZIR Battalion approach the entourage as they get to show their respects . The Haka is used throughout New Zealand by many, not only Maori, to demonstrate their collective thoughts. There is a haka for each of the Services, as well as the Defence Force. Units with the NZ Army have their own haka. Haka, sometimes termed a posture dance, could also be described as a chant with actions. There are various forms of haka; some with weapons some without, some have set actions others may be 'free style.' The entire group perform in fantastic unison as they recite the Maori-borne celebration . It's a spine-tingling occasion as the soldiers honour their fallen comrade at the military unit . Haka is used by Maori (indigenous people of New Zealand) for a myriad of reasons; to challenge or express defiance or contempt, to demonstrate approval or appreciation, to encourage or to discourage, to acknowledge feats and achievements, to welcome, to farewell, as an expression of pride, happiness or sorrow. There is almost no inappropriate occasion for haka; it is an outward display of inner thoughts and emotions. Within the context of an occasion it is abundantly clear which emotion is being expressed.","Soldiers of New Zealand 2/1 RNZIR Battalion perform their Unit Haka .

"A major Sydney hospital is trying to contact women who had babies at the facility after discovering a fault in a refrigerator containing vaccines. Royal Prince Alfred Hospital general manager Deborah Willcox said the vaccines may have been exposed to temperatures just outside acceptable or optimal levels. 'We cannot absolutely guarantee their effectiveness,' she said on Tuesday. Ms Willcox stressed there was no risk associated with the slightly differing storage temperatures and said attempts to contact the 570 women admitted to one of the hospital's post-natal wards was precautionary. These vaccines may not provide adequate protection against the illness. The women would have had their babies at the hospital between August 2013 and January this year at a ward, 8 East, at RPA. Royal Prince Alfred Hospital admits that a faulty fridge affected the temperature of a vaccine between August 2013 and this month . ‘On the behalf of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital I would like to sincerely apologise for any concern this incident may have caused or may cause,’ said Ms Willcox. ‘We are taking a very precautionary approach and that is because mothers and babies are incredibly important to us.’ A free clinic has been set up to re-vaccinate affected persons. Despite the critical error, the hospital assures the public that they can trust their facilities and staff. 'I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that they can continue have every confidence in Royal Prince Alfred Hospital,' said Ms Willcox. 'It is a proud hospital with an outstanding reputation. High quality patient care is our priority.' The vaccine stored in the fridge was Boostrix, which is used to protect women from Dyptheria, Tetanus, Whopping Cough, Hepatitis B, Measles, Mumps and Rubella. The 570 women who will receive a phone call were identified through the use of log books, which recorded variations to the temperature of the vaccinations as far back as August 2013. An investigation will take place to determine why the variances were not reported or flagged. 'There's no question that this is incredibly disappointing for us to understand that there have been variances over that period of time,' said Ms Willcox. 'We are undertaking an investigation so we can absolutely understand how this could have occurred.' The problem was detected around ten days ago. Anyone with concerns are encouraged to contact the clinical hotline on 1800 300 333.","Royal Prince Alfred Hospital admits that a faulty fridge affected the temperature of a vaccine between August 2013 and this month .

"Motorists could be forced to pay to drive ‘by the kilometre’ on British roads under plans being drawn up by bureaucrats in Brussels. EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said she was working on plans for an EU-wide road toll scheme in order to standardise charges across the continent. The scheme would require every car to be fitted with an electronic device containing a satellite receiver that would record the distance travelled and bill the motorist accordingly. Motorists could be forced to pay to drive ‘by the kilometre’ on British roads under plans being drawn up by bureaucrats in Brussels . Miss Bulc said the scheme could be made ‘obligatory’ across the EU. The idea last night provoked an angry reaction in London, where ministers insisted there were no plans to introduce a national road toll scheme in Britain. The last proposal for a national ‘road pricing’ scheme was abandoned by Labour in 2007 in the face of overwhelming public opposition. A senior Tory source said: ‘There are no plans for road tolls in the UK, whatever this EU bureaucrat might say. It is hard to see any UK driver welcoming this bonkers idea and if they want a referendum on our relationship with the EU they need to vote for a Conservative government.’ Robert Oxley, campaign director at the campaign group Business for Britain, said new road tolls would cripple British motorists. Mr Oxley said: ‘Motorists and firms already pay enough to use the roads, without EU tolls adding to that burden. It's ludicrous that the EU would even consider hitting hard-pressed drivers with further charges. It appears some in the commission just don't understand that decisions like these should be taken in the UK, not Brussels.’ EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said she was working on plans for an EU-wide road toll scheme . But Miss Bulc insisted the time had come to consider the introduction of a common road pricing scheme operating across the EU. She said there were many different systems in Europe at the moment and claimed this was a burden on car drivers and an obstacle to their mobility. She told the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag that it made sense to work on a European system for lorries and cars that could regulate road charges in a uniform manner for all EU countries. ‘The amount of the fee should, in my opinion, be exclusively based on the number of kilometres actually driven and should not be time-dependent,’ she said. ‘It doesn't matter where you come from - everyone will only pay for the distance they have actually driven and it will be billed on a device throughout Europe. We're currently investigating just such an idea.’ Miss Bulc said no decision had yet been made on whether countries like Britain would be allowed to seek an opt-out from the new regime. She said: ‘There are many options - a fee could be obligatory but it's also possible to make it optional i.e. that countries decide themselves whether and on which roads they want to levy a road use charge based on kilometres driven.’ The last Labour government spent years trying to introduce a national road pricing scheme in Britain. It was finally abandoned in 2007 after 1.8 million people signed a petition against it. Many motorists feared the charges would just be a new tax on top of road tax and fuel duty. As a result, the UK still has only a relatively small number of toll roads and road pricing schemes.","Brussels Transport Commissioner working on plans for EU toll scheme .

"A lawyer representing Joan Rivers' daughter in her multimillion-dollar lawsuit against a New York City clinic claims that had doctors not been so busy fawning over the comedienne during a procedure on her throat, she would have been alive today. Melissa Rivers said in a statement Monday that filing the lawsuit against her mother's doctors and Yorkville Endoscopy was one of the most difficult decisions she had to make. 'What ultimately guided me was my unwavering belief that no family should ever have to go through what my mother, Cooper and I have been through,' she said, referring to her son. A lawyer representing Joan Rivers' daughter, Melissa (left), in her multimillion-dollar lawsuit claims that had doctors not been so busy fawning over the comic during a procedure on her throat, she would have been alive today . 'The level of medical mismanagement, incompetency, disrespect and outrageous behavior is shocking and frankly, almost incomprehensible.' She said her 81-year-old mother deserved better. Miss Rivers, a comedienne who crashed the male-dominated realm of late-night talk shows and starred with her daughter on E! in Fashion Police, died September 4, 2014, a week after undergoing a routine surgery on her throat. The city's medical examiner found that she died of brain damage due to lack of oxygen after she stopped breathing during an endoscopy at Yorkville Endoscopy days earlier. Her death was classified as a therapeutic complication. Lawsuit: Joan Rivers's daughter Melissa (pictured with her mother in 2005) has filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the New York-based endoscopy clinic where the comedian fell into a coma before her death . Melissa Rivers' lawsuit said doctors mishandled the endoscopy and performed another medical procedure called a laryngoscopy on her vocal cords without consent. The suit said the doctor left the operating room to avoid being caught. The 47-year-old TV producer is also suing the doctors who treated Rivers prior to her death, claiming their 'negligence' and 'carelessness' triggered the star's fatal coma. 'To put it mildly, we are not just disappointed by the acts and omissions leading to the death of Joan Rivers, but we are outraged by the lack of care and concern for Ms. Rivers on the part of her treating physicians and the endoscopy center where the treatment was rendered,' said her attorneys, Jeffrey Bloom and Ben Rubinowitz. A federal investigation, ordered by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, found the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic made several errors, including failing to keep proper medication records and snapping cell phone photos of Rivers while she was unconscious in the operating room. 'Had the doctors acted as physicians for Joan Rivers instead of groupies, Joan Rivers would have been doing Fashion Police last week,' said Jeffrey Bloom. The probe into the clinic also found the Manhattan clinic failed to get informed consent for every procedure performed and failed to record Rivers' weight before the administration of sedation medication. Clinic: In a statement, Melissa Rivers's lawyer announced she is suing Yorkville Endoscopy (pictured) in Manhattan, where her mother suffered a fatal complication during routine throat surgery on August 28 . Joan Rivers, who rose to fame on The Tonight Show, died of brain damage due to lack of oxygen after she stopped breathing during what was meant to be a simple endoscopy and throat exam at the clinic. In the lawsuit, her daughter alleges that doctors did not only carry out those procedures, but also conducted an unauthorized exam of her vocal chords and windpipe, leading to a laryngospasm. During the spasm, Rivers's throat seized up and deprived her brain of oxygen so she could not expel carbon dioxide from her lungs, the suit, filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday, states. But despite the star's vital signs showing clear symptoms of distress, doctors decided to continue with the laryngoscopy, causing Rivers to ultimately suffer a heart attack and irreversible brain damage, the court documents state. Suing: The 47-year-old television producer is also suing the doctors who treated Rivers prior to her death aged 81 on September 4, claiming their negligence triggered the star's fatal coma. Above, a photo of the lawsuit . The suit goes on to claim that although doctors tried to revive the comedian for around 20 minutes, no one performed a trachetomy to open up her airways by cutting into her trachea, the New York Daily News reported. Instead, Rivers was rushed to nearby Mount Sinai hospital in a coma, where she was put on life support. However, she never regained consciousness and passed away a week later. The complaint names five individual doctors - as well as the clinic on East 93rd Street - as defendants. 'Negligent': Melissa explained that the lawsuit (part of which is pictured above) stems from her 'unwavering belief' that no-one should have to suffer the levels of 'medical mismanagement' that her mother did . Accused: One of the doctors the suit refers to is River's private doctor, ENT specialist Gwen Korovin (right), who 'was permitted to do an unauthorized biopsy on Rivers by medical director, Lawrence Cohen (left)' One of the doctors it refers to is River's private doctor, celebrity ENT specialist Gwen Korovin, who was 'permitted to do the unauthorized biopsy by the clinic's medical director, Lawrence Cohen'. At the time, Korovin wasn't cleared to work at the clinic, it states, adding that Cohen 'failed to mention' the procedures carried out by by the doctor and even the fact that she was in the room. Melissa Rivers' lawsuit alleges that during the fateful medical procedure on her mother, Rivers' doctors brushed off concerns voiced by anesthesiologist Renuka Bankulla, who noticed 'incredible edema,' or swelling, in her throat. Court documents state that when Bankulla suggested taking a picture of the swelling, the lead doctor, Lawrence Cohen, overruled her, calling the anesthesiologist 'paranoid' and a 'curious cat.' The medical team proceeded with the endoscopy, even as Rivers' vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, oxygen level and heart rate - all dropped and the levels of carbon dioxide in her blood spiked, according to the lawsuit. As Rivers' condition deteriorated, her doctors jumped into action trying to revive her, but according to the lawsuit, they failed to give her a muscle relaxant to open up her throat, nor did they perform a potentially life-saving tracheotomy. Instead, the medics unsuccessfully tried to save their famous patient with chest compressions, intubation and a hand pump for her lungs. About 17 minutes later, the anesthesiologist asked for a tracheotomy kit, but it went unused, the suit states. The lawsuit claims that Gwen Korovin could have performed an emergency tracheotomy, but she had left the room. Experts told the Post that Melissa could win millions of dollars in the suit because her mother was still making good money from stand-up gigs, books and TV shows in the weeks before her death. Indeed, the comedian performed at a Manhattan club the night before she fell into a coma. She had arranged the throat procedure because her voice had turned raspy and she did not know the cause. 'Unauthorized biopsy': This section of the lawsuit shows some of the allegations against Cohen and Korovin . Celebrity: Experts said Melissa could win millions of dollars in the suit because her mother (pictured on Celebrity Apprentice) was still making good money from stand-up gigs, books and TV shows  before her death . The lawsuit comes just two weeks after it was revealed that Yorkville Endoscopy has lost its federal accreditation and will stop receiving funds at the end of January. In a letter sent to the clinic, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the clinic it no longer meets their conditions for coverage after failing to identify Rivers's deteriorating vital signs. 'Therefore, CMS is terminating the Medicare Health Benefits Agreement between Yorkville Endoscopy and the Secretary, effective January 31, 2015,' it said on January 12. 'As of January 31, 2015 Yorkville Endoscopy will no longer be eligible to receive federal funds for services provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.' Despite those losses, the clinic later issued a statement  indicating its intention to remain viable. 'Yorkville Endoscopy LLC does not intend to cease operations. Yorkville is hoping to cooperate with regulators to have the recent decision reversed or modified,' the clinic told ABC News. Yorkville Endoscopy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from AP.","Melissa Rivers has filed a lawsuit against Yorkville Endoscopy in New York .

"Angela Nangle (pictured) spent £50,000 injury compensation on 'fine wine, fine food, male companionship and escorts', a court heard . A pensioner spent £50,000 personal injury compensation on 'fine wine, fine food, male companionship and escorts' so she would not lose her housing benefit, a court heard. Angela Nangle made withdrawals of up to £3,000 a day so that she would not have to declare the money as a form of income, Brighton Magistrates' Court was told. The 62-year-old, of  Brighton, East Sussex, notified civic chiefs in 2009 that she would be receiving personal injury compensation in excess of £16,000 - the minimum amount which would deprive a person of benefit, the court heard. It was placed in a trust fund so it would not be taken into account for housing benefit purposes, council prosecutor Len Batten said. But in August 2013, Nangle failed to declare any money was being held in a trust fund on a review form, Mr Batten told the court. Questions were then raised as to what she had done with the cash, he said. The prosecutor claimed that between May 27 and June 29, 2012, Nangle had made daily withdrawals averaging up to £3,000 until the money had run out. He said: 'The defendant admitted she had been withdrawing the money in cash rather than putting it into a bank account because she knew if she did it would be included in a housing benefit claim. 'She said she had not kept receipts but had spent the money on fine wine, fine food, male companionship and escorts, and that she had withdrawn it quickly because it was more trouble than it was worth to keep it.' Nangle pleaded not guilty on November 7 last year to failing to notify Brighton and Hove City Council of a change in her circumstances between May 27 and June 29, 2012, the court was told. Angela Nangle made withdrawals of up to £3,000 a day so that she would not have to declare the money as a form of income, Brighton Magistrates' Court (pictured) was told . John Hunter, defending Nangle, claimed the wrong test as to whether it was reasonable for the pensioner to claim housing benefit had been applied by the council officer looking at the case. He said it was unclear whether an offence had been committed. Magistrates adjourned the case and told Nangle she would next appear at Eastbourne Magistrates' Court on March 6 for a pre-trial review hearing.

"Saudi Arabia has carried out the second, third and fourth beheadings under the reign of King Salman just days after he assumed the throne. Today's executions of the men, two of whom were accused of drug smuggling, show the oil-rich Arab state is unlikely to back down over the enforcement of its strict version of Sharia law. One of the men, convicted heroin trafficker Latif Khan Nurzada from Pakistan, was executed in the holy city  Mecca - within  hours of the new king meeting U.S. President Barack Obama. Scroll down for video . Uncompromising: Saudi Arabia beheaded three more people today, within hours of its new King Salman (right) meeting U.S. President Barack Obama. The country has faced criticism over its human rights record . One of the other two, Omar bin Yahya bin Ibrahim al-Barkati, was convicted of incest and beheaded in the south western Asir region. 'He was executed as punishment for his crime and as a lesson to others,' said an interior ministry statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency. The third man, Yassir bin Hussein al-Hamza, was executed in the north western Jawf region after he allegedly confessed to smuggling amphetamine pills. According to a tally by the news agency AFP, their executions bring Saudi Arabia's number of executions to 16 already this year. The number jumped from 27 in 2010 to around 80 every year under Salman's predecessor King Abdullah, with 87 last year. Yesterday the oil-rich state carried out its first execution under the rule of King Salman by beheading  a convicted serial rapist. Regime: Four people have already been beheaded in Saudi Arabia in the days since King Salman, pictured meeting Prime Minister David Cameron on Sunday, assumed the throne following King Abdullah's death . Moussa al-Zahrani, 45, had been found guilty of 'luring underage girls, intoxicating them, forcing them to watch pornographic videos and then physically and sexually assaulting them', an Interior Ministry statement said. But the beheading, which took place in Jeddah, caused outrage on social media after the Arabic language teacher maintained his innocence and claimed he had been framed by police. The father-of-six was found guilty of assaulting young girls  a string of attacks in Jeddah in 2011. He maintained his innocence throughout the trial and two later appeals, and last year, al-Zahrani appealed in a 20-minute video for the late  King Abdullah to intervene. The video, which was spread on social media in Saudi Arabia, saw al-Zahrani claim that he was being framed by police and that one of his accusers, his neighbour of ten years, was also a police investigator in the case. Brutal: The three new executions follow the public beheading of a woman which was filmed in secret and leaked online (pictured). The incident sparked outrage, not for the punishment but because it was filmed . An Arabic hashtag on Twitter, 'We are all Moussa al-Zahrani' garnered thousands of comments by Saudis with conflicting opinions over the case. Al-Zahrani's relatives have appeared on Saudi talk shows, saying the case was riddled with inconsistencies and that the judiciary did not weigh all the evidence. They claimed a medical report found the neighbour's ten-year-old daughter had not been assaulted and that several cases of assault against young girls took place in Jeddah while al-Zahrani was already jailed. Speaking after the execution, his brother, Hassan al-Zahrani said hat his brother could not have committed the crimes he was convicted of. Al-Zahrani was one of 11 people beheaded in Saudi Arabia so far this year. Saudi Arabia executed 87 people last year, up from 78 in 2013. The execution of al-Zahrani follows the public beheading of a woman which was filmed in secret and leaked online. Saudi Arabia's interior ministry said one of the men was executed today  in the holy city of Mecca (pictured) Layla bint Abdul Mutaleb Bassim, convicted of raping and murdering her six-year-old stepdaughter, was heard screaming her innocence in graphic footage of the execution. The incident sparked outrage in Saudi Arabia, but not  because of the beheading, but rather that the execution was filmed and posted online, where the woman's family might see it. Saudi Arabia, which has one of the highest execution rates in the world, follows a strict interpretation of Islamic law and applies the death penalty for crimes such as murder, rape and witchcraft. The kingdom had the third-highest number of recorded executions in 2013, behind Iran and Iraq, Amnesty International says. A United Nations special rapporteur has said trials leading to the death penalty in Saudi Arabia are 'grossly unfair'. Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking are punishable by death in the oil-rich Gulf state, which is a close ally of Washington and a regular customer of both American and British arms companies.","One of the  men, a convicted heroin trafficker, executed in holy city Mecca .

"A small child was just inches away from an armed robbery yesterday. Surveillance footage from the McDonald's in Houston, Texas shows a little boy dangerously close to the gunman. The footage shows four men walking into the fast food chain casually as though they are going to order food. Protected: This little boy is yanked away by a family members as armed robbers threaten the McDonald's cashier with a gun . Theft: The robbers successfully scared the cashier into giving them money just a week after the suspects robbed several other stores . Their behavior changes suddenly as a man pulls out a gun and points it at the cashier and dangerously close to an innocent young boy. Witnesses at the McDonald’s robbery were horrified to see the boy so close to the gun but the little boy's family member was able to quickly yank him out of harm's way. Luckily no one was injured in the robbery. Police say the men are the same four who went on a crime spree last week. Just last Thursday, a Specs and four cell phone stores were robbed, reports KHOU. 'Oh my God and I was there yesterday. I see the police here,' said Maria Gonzalez, to KHOU. 'I know you wouldn't want that around your kids, respect the kids,' said one customer. Customers sympathized with staff members who are merely trying to make an honest living. One petrified employee was forced to get an undisclosed amount of money from the back room as a suspect stood over him with a gun. A nearby McDonald's was also robbed later that day. The suspects are still on the run but are asking anyone with tips to call 713-222-tips. ""It's not something we want to promote in our community,' said a customer. 'It's kind of scary, really scary,' said Omar Gonzalez, a customer. Armed: This robber pointed a gun at the cashier and the boy was just inches away from him .

"A Russian weight-loss group has been criticised for urging its members to follow a 'blockade diet' in memory of the Siege of Leningrad. Get Thin Like Me invited its followers to go on a diet based on the rations supplied during the siege to 'honour' World War II veterans. The Siege of Leningrad, when Nazi Germany forces surrounded the city for nearly 2.5 years, saw 630,000 people die of starvation in what is now St. Petersburg. Inappropriate: Weight-loss group 'Get Thin Like Me' invited its Facebook followers to go on a 'blockade diet' based on the rations supplied during the Siege of Leningrad, which saw 630,000 people die of starvation . The 'blockade diet' was posted on Get Thin Like Me's Facebook page to coincide with the 71st anniversary of St Petersburg's liberation from the siege. 'Watch your figure and commemorate the Leningrad siege at the same time!,' the post urged, according to The Moscow Times. 'We'll load up at the rate of factory workers doing a full day's shift in December 1941 - 400 grams of bread, and as many glasses of water as you like. 'Men can have 100 grams of vodka at night, but only in place of bread,' the post said. The Get Thin Like Me group also helpfully posted a recipe for 'blockade bread', including some ingredients only available in pet shops. Dark days: Food was so scarce during the 1941-1944 Siege of Leningrad that residents were forced to eat pets, dirt and glue, and some even resorted to cannibalism . Horror scenes: Dead bodies littered the streets of Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, for days during the siege as the survivors were too weak to bury the deceased. The post was met with a barrage of criticism, with several Facebook users accusing the weight-loss group of being insensitive and dishonouring the memory of the victims. The Siege of Leningrad began on September 8, 1941, when Nazi forces fully encircled the city, three months after launching Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union. The city of almost 3 million civilians - including about 400,000 children - endured rapidly increasing hardship. Most of them died of hunger and exhaustion during an extremely cold winter at the beginning of the siege from 1941 to 1942 when rations fell to just 125 grams of bread per person for white-collar workers and municipal heating was switched off. People were forced to eat pets, dirt and glue, and some even resorted to cannibalism. Dead bodies littered the streets for days as the survivors were too weak to bury the deceased. By the time the siege ended on January 27, 1944, 872 days later, an estimated 630,000 people had died, but some historians estimate this number to be closer to 800,000.","'Get Thin Like Me' urged followers to try the 'blockade diet' in post .

"President Barack Obama defended the US government's willingness to cooperate closely with Saudi Arabia on national security despite deep concerns over human rights abuses, as he led an array of current and former American statesmen in paying respects Tuesday following the death of King Abdullah. Saudi Arabia's status as one of Washington's most important Arab allies has at times appeared to trump US concerns about the terrorist funding that flows from the kingdom and about human rights abuses. But Obama said he has found it most effective to apply steady pressure over human rights 'even as we are getting business done that needs to get done.' 'Sometimes we need to balance our need to speak to them about human rights issues with immediate concerns we have in terms of counterterrorism or dealing with regional stability,' Obama said in a CNN interview that aired in advance of Obama's arrival. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama cut short his trip to India to fly to Riyadh on Tuesday to pay his respects following the death of King Abdullah and meet his successor, King Salman . First Lady Michelle Obama covered up her arms for the officials meeting with leaders of Saudi Arabia, one of the most repressive nations in the world when it comes to women's rights . Obama was greeted at Air Force One by new Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz . The Obamas were greeted by an armed Saudi honor guard and a military band playing the national anthems for both the US and Saudi Arabia . Stepping off the plane in Riyadh, the president and First Lady Michelle Obama were greeted by new King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud and a military band playing both countries' national anthems. Some of the all-male Saudi delegation shook hands with Mrs Obama while others gave her a nod as they passed by. Mrs Obama wore full-length clothing but no headscarf, as is typical for many Western women in Saudi Arabia, despite the strict dress code for Saudi women appearing in public. Salman formally greeted the U.S. delegation soon after at the Erga Palace on the outskirts of Riyadh, where dozens of Saudi officials filed through a marble-walled room to greet the Americans under massive crystal chandeliers. After dinner at the palace, Obama was to hold his first formal meeting with Salman before his four-hour trip came to an end. Ahead of his arrival, Obama suggested that he would not be raising U.S. concerns about Saudi Arabia's flogging of blogger Raif Badawi, who was convicted of insulting Islam and sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes. His first flogging took place in early January in front of dozens of people in the Red Sea city of Jiddah, though a second round has been postponed after a doctor said his wounds from the first lashes had not yet healed.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was among the American delegation that welcomed the rule of King Salman, half-brother of King Abdullah . Secretary of State John Kerry (right) was also on hand to pay his respects to King Salman and offer condolences about his half-brother . 'On this visit, obviously a lot of this is just paying respects to King Abdullah, who in his own fashion presented some modest reform efforts within the kingdom,' Obama said. Obama cut short the final day of his trip to India to make the four-hour stop in Riyadh. Further underscoring the key role Saudi Arabia has long played in U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East was the extensive delegation that joined Obama for the visit. Secretary of State John Kerry was joining Obama in Riyadh, along with former Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and James Baker III, both of whom served Republican presidents. Former White House national security advisers Brent Scowcroft, Sandy Berger and Stephen Hadley also made the trip, as did Sen. John McCain, the Arizona republican who is a frequent critic of Obama's foreign policy in the Middle East.

Sword-wielding palace guards stood at the entrance of Erga Palace as President Obama arrived to meet the new Saudi king . The palace guards stood at attention for the American guests . Top members of the Saudi military - from all branches - were on hand to greet the American delegation at the airport . CIA Director John Brennan and Gen. Lloyd Austin, commander of U.S. Central Command, which overseas military activity in the Middle East, were also taking part in Tuesday's meetings with the Saudis. 'It meets the threshold of being bipartisan, high-level and people who worked very closely with Saudi Arabia over many years,' said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser. Despite vast differences of opinions on many issues, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have worked in close coordination to address evolving security concerns in the tumultuous region. Most recently, Saudi Arabia became one of a handful of Arab nations that have joined the U.S. in launching airstrikes against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. In his initial days on the throne, the 79-year-old Salman has given little indication that he plans to bring fundamental changes to his country's policies. In a nationally televised address shortly after his half brother's death, Salman vowed to hew to 'the correct policies which Saudi Arabia has followed since its establishment.' Obama acknowledged that the U.S. willingness to pursue close ties with Saudi Arabia despite human rights abuses often makes America's allies uncomfortable. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi shook hands with the new kind. She was part of the American delegation that traveled to Saudi Arabia with Obama . Senator John McCain was also in attendance at Erga Palace to meet King Salman . US Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Joseph Westphal was among the US delegation . George H.W. Bush's former Secretary of State, James Baker, was in attendance, as well . 'The trend-line is one that I will sustain throughout the rest of my presidency,' Obama said, 'and that is to make the case to our friends and allies that if they want a society that is able to sustain itself in this day and age, then they're going to have to change how they do business.' Obama's presidency has also been marked by occasional strains with the Saudi royal family. Abdullah, the 90-year-old monarch who died Friday, had pressed the U.S. to take more aggressive action to force Syrian President Bashar Assad from power. The royal family is also deeply skeptical of Obama's diplomacy with rival Iran. Salman is a veteran of the country's top leadership and well-versed in diplomacy from nearly 50 years as the governor of the capital Riyadh. He is known as a mediator of disputes within the sprawling royal family who increasingly took on the duties of the king as the ailing Abdullah became more incapacitated. Several regional leaders traveled to Saudi Arabia to attend Abdullah's Muslim-only funeral Friday. Since then, a string of Western leaders and top dignitaries have announced plans to travel to the kingdom to pay their respects and meet the newly enthroned king.","President Barack Obama defended the US relationship with Saudia Arabia despite funding for terrorism and human rights abuses .

"A teenager has celebrated her miraculous survival one year after she plunged 3,500 feet when her parachute became tangled during a skydive. Doctors said they had no idea how Makenzie Wethington, from Joshua, Texas, survived the fall in Chickasha, Oklahoma in January 2014. She was left with broken bones and a brain injury. 'A year ago, we wouldn't think I was gonna live, and now I'm here a year later,' she told NBCDFW. To mark the anniversary on Sunday, the 17-year-old, who is now walking again, returned to Oklahoma to meet and thank the emergency responders who helped save her life. Scroll down for video . Reunited: Texas teenager Makenzie Wethington returned to Chickasha, Oklahoma on Sunday to meet the medical staff who treated her after she hit the ground during the botched skydive a year ago . Excited: 'These men are all my heroes to say at the least,' she wrote as she shared images of the reunion . 'I just really wanted to see who helped save my life,' she said. 'Meeting them was just the best day of my life.' On Facebook, she shared images of her grinning alongside the four men and the ambulance that held her until an air ambulance arrived to fly her to hospital. 'These men are all my heroes to say at the least,' she wrote alongside the pictures. 'I thank God every day for saving my life and for giving the people who assisted in my journey the strength to help get me where I am today. Thank you to all who supported me and giving me the motivation to fight. A year ago I was Makenzie Strong, but today I am ""Makenzie-Stronger"".' Last year, she had traveled to Chickasha with her father to skydive for her 16th birthday. In Texas, the legal age to sk-dive is 18 but Oklahoma allows 16-year-olds to jump with parental permission. Her father, Joe Wethington, said in an interview after the incident that he thought she would jump from a plane with a guide but instead, she was told to jump alone. 'She wasn't prepared,' Joe Wethington said. 'We weren't walked through the steps for the malfunction that did take place, at all.' Excitement: Makenzie, then 16, can be seen grinning before her ill-fated jump in January 2014 . Day out: Her father, Joe Wethington, had agreed to take her to Oklahoma, where 16-year-olds can skydive . Bob Swainson, the owner of skydiving company Pegasus, said Makenzie and her father had about six hours of training before they jumped and were taught how to respond in emergency situations. During the fall, her parachute ropes became tangled and Makenzie can only remember screaming before blacking out. She suffered a major fracture in her liver, broke her pelvis, shoulder blade, several ribs, a lumbar vertebra in her lower spine and a tooth. She also suffered a traumatic brain injury. 'I wasn't there, but if she truly fell 3,500ft I have no idea how she survived,' Jeffrey Bender, the OU Medical Center trauma surgeon who treated Makenzie, said in a news conference days later. 'When I saw her in the emergency department, I would have predicted she was not going to survive all of this. But I'm always happy to be wrong about these things.' She spent nearly a week in the Intensive Care Unit at the University of Oklahoma Medical Center and as she improved, she was transferred to the Baylor Institute for Rehabilitation in Dallas. Injuries: She suffered a major fracture in her liver, broke her pelvis, shoulder blade, several ribs, a lumbar vertebra in her lower spine and a tooth. She also suffered a traumatic brain injury . Determined: Despite the pain from her broken bones, Makenzie (left at a press conference in February 2014 and right in rehab a week earlier) said she fought to walk because she  didn't want to be in a wheelchair . Speaking with NBC, she recalled how she was unable to put weight on her legs as she tried to walk, so instead had to use her upper body strength - despite broken shoulder and collar bones. 'But I was determined because I did not want to be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life,' she said. She went home in mid-February 2014 and is now walking on her own. She said the pain is improving although she suffers headaches and migraines. Makenzie, who has returned to school, now hopes to become a trauma surgeon to help others like she was helped. And as for skydiving, she said the next time she even considers it will be after she's lived a long life. 'Like when I'm 95, maybe,' she said, laughing.

"From racism and gay slurs to sexual harassment and X-rated revelations, the current series of Celebrity Big Brother is shaping up to be the most offensive yet. Now with rumours that Katie Price's love rival - Jane Pountney, the former best friend who slept with her husband Kieran Hayler - is joining the house, it's clear the reality show's bosses are intent on creating a programme that is nothing less than explosive. But experts say that no matter how badly the contestants behave viewers keep tuning in because it makes 'us feel better about ourselves'. Scroll down for video . Blogger Perez Hilton has become one of the dominant figures in the house clashing with Katie Hopkins daily . Shock queen Katie Price has over-shared about her past husbands, exes and their sexual proclivities . Calum Best has been seen getting close to Cami Li but Perez Hilton has described it as a 'showmance' The past week has included a litany of insults and abuse. Perez Hilton accused his in-house tormentor Katie Hopkins of being homophobic after she told him to 'man up.' Katie  Price has mooned at the camera, talked about sex toys and anal sex and how one partner gave her cystitis. She's blasted her ex-husband Alex Reid for his alleged sexual proclivities and referred to another ex, Danny Cipriani, as having a small penis in conversations with her fellow housemates. Her headline-grabbing stories follow early exits from three other housemates. Coronation Street actor Ken Morley, 71, famous for playing Reg Holdsworth in the soap, made regular mention of the female housemates' bodies and was eventually removed after he used the word, 'negro,' twice in reference to soul singer Alexander O'Neal. Ken Morley was the first to leave the Big Brother house, he was accused of racism, sexism and misogyny . Communications watchdog Ofcom said that they had a total of 1,605 complaints in total about the show and 233 about Ken's language. They have had 708 complaints about the treatment of Perez Hilton and 90 about former model Alicia Douvall being bullied. Some of the housemates had called her 'stupid,' and Katie Hopkins said that if all the world was filled with people like Alicia it would be a worse place. The complaints are currently under assessment and Ofcom have not yet decided whether they will launch any formal investigations. Alicia Douvall accused glamour girl Cami Li (pictured) of being threatening after she just 'went for her' In the 2007 series of Big Brother the late Jade Goody and her fellow housemates Jo O'Meara and Danielle O'Heara were accused of bullying and racially abusing Shilpa Shetty . Yet the housemates' behaviour degenerated further as after drinking too much, Baywatch actor Jeremy Jackson went to the toilet to be sick, where Chloe Goodman, wearing a dressing gown, followed him to help. He then pulled open her dressing gown to reveal her bare breast. Jackson dismissed the incident as a case of 'curiosity killed the cat' and was ejected from the show. Hertfordshire Police, which covers the area where the show is filmed, confirmed at the time that they were investigating the situation, however, Chloe later decided not to press charges. Meanwhile, Alexander, 61, who had hits in the Eighties with Criticize and Saturday Love, made the statement: 'I hoped there were no Arabs in the house,' despite having claimed to, 'hate', racism. And a series of furious bust-ups between Perez and Alexander saw the singer walk out claiming he had to remove himself from the house because he was fearful of what he may do - but not before he used an offensive gay slur to describe the US blogger. Alexander O'Neal left the house over clashes with Perez Hilton and he was also accused of racism . While Celebrity Big Brother producers usually rub their hands with glee at the antics on the show, they can only be dismayed by the degree to which the housemates have insulted each other on the basis of gender, race and orientation. Experts say the endless rows and clashes are a result of  the particular combination of strong personalities this year, as each housemate struggles for dominance. Behavioral psychologist Marisa Peer says that part of the reason the stars are acting out so much is because they know it will garner them a huge deal of attention. She said: 'The housemates will 100 per cent exaggerate their characters from the outside world. Nice people simply are not entertaining and they know that. 'We watch the shows for the fights and that’s what we remember about them.' Katie Hopkins gets up close and personal with Michelle Visage during a fake tanning session . In the outside world Katie Hopkins is known for her acerbic ways and in the house she has been fighting with her fellow housemtes, especially Perez Hilton . She said: 'This series is the first series where there have been a lot of very similar characters, they all have this need to be in control. 'Usually there are only one or two people with those strong characters and then you have the slightly crazier periphery characters. 'But this year you have Perez, Katie Hopkins, Nadia Sawalha and Michelle Visage all competing for top dog spot and they’re all people who are used to being in control.' And the sight of these adults clashing and bickering childishly has a positive effect on the viewers,. Marisa said. Katie Price has shocked both her fellow housemates and audiences alike talking about her ex-boyfriends . The two Katies - Price and Hopkins - have been determined to shock during their time on the Channel 5 show . 'Watching it makes us feel better about ourselves, we think – I would never do that, I would never behave in that way. 'Plus it's a show you can watch with all your family, although you think the behaviour can be awful it gives you something to talk about and discuss.' And although there may not have been as many official complaints about this series as the 2007 series in which Jade Goody and Jo Meara bullied Shilpa Shetty, this is down to the different ways we vent our anger in the era of social media. Some 44,500 people complained to Ofcom during Celebrity Big Brother 5, but there were more than 24,000 tweets about Ken Morley and more than 100,000 about Jeremy Jackson. In the first few days of Katie Price's inclusion in the house, 300,000 tweets circulated online about her antics. Neil Peplow, COO at the MET film school, said our reactions to this series of CBB has been magnified by our use of smartphones and tablets. He said: 'People are no longer looking at just one screen on their sofas at home. While watching traditional TV we are on Facebook, Twitter and the internet at the same time. 'Outrageous reality TV like CBB draws that attention back to the the big screen because people want to share their outrage within a community. It's the digital version of a water cooler.' And with hard-line chat-show host Jeremy Kyle widely reported to be entering the house we can only imagine that the show is set to get more controversial in the days to come. This isn't the first year that all hell has broken loose in the Celebrity Big Brother house... 2007: Big Brother 5 was a series that will go down in history. The late Jade Goody, S Club 7 singer Jo O'Meara and were accused of racially abusing and bulling their fellow housemate Bollywood star, Shilpa Shetty. After leaving the house Jo went into hiding while Jade, who apologised profusely for her actions, was subject to death threats. 2010: In 2010 rapper Coolio decided to leave the Big Brother house of his own accord following a fight with Nadia Almada. In the same year racing pundit John McCririck came under fire for his misogynistic comments about women. 2013: US reality stars Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag asked to speak to their lawyers after a particularly huge row in the Big Brother house in 2013. The fight between the pair and Neil 'Razor' Ruddock turned nasty after the couple had been accused of faking their relationship. Neil squared up to both Spencer and Heidi with fellow housemates Rylan Clark and Gillian Taylforth pulling him away from the situation. 2014: Last year Linda Nolan ended up in floods of tears following an almighty row with fellow contestant Jim Davidson. The pair fought about Linda's late husband with Jim calling Linda an 'a**ehole,' he had bought up an incident in which her late husband Brian Hudson - who died in 2007 - had stolen money from Frank Carson's wallet.","Katie Price's shock allegations of ex-husband's sexual proclivities .

"Housemaster David Lowe, 61, (pictured outside an earlier court hearing) has been convicted of abusing 10 boys aged under 14 between 1978 and 1984 . A former housemaster at a leading Catholic public school has been found guilty of a string of historic sex assaults on young boys, including a chorister who sang at his wedding. David Lowe, 61, who taught English and music, was today convicted of abusing six boys aged under 14 while teaching at Westminster Cathedral Choir School in London in the 1970s and 1980s. The married teacher, who now lives in Bristol, was also found guilty of indecently assaulting four boys while working at Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire – one of the country's leading Catholic public schools where boarding fees are currently more than £31,000 a year. A jury of seven men and five women at Southwark Crown Court took around nine-and-a-half hours to convict the Cambridge English graduate of 15 counts of indecent assault against 10 young boys between 1978 and 1984. Dressed in a dark suit with an open-necked blue shirt, Lowe – who was supported by wife Ursula throughout the trial - looked emotionless as the jury returned majority verdicts on all 15 charges. During the trial, the court heard how the former housemaster indecently assaulted some of the young boys in Westminster as they lay in their bunks in communal dormitories. He fondled other pupils during individual singing lessons, in his office or flat, or as he smacked them on their bare bottoms as punishment, the court heard. Former pupils said Lowe 'bribed' them with sweets and compliments while asking them to say nothing about the abuse. Earlier in the trial, Prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC  said: 'David Lowe had a small group of pupils that he was extra-friendly with. 'He would leave sweets in his locker and notes, [like], ""You're very special, you deserve this, enjoy"". One victim, a former pupil at Westminster Cathedral Choir School, told police he was among 'a select group of boys' asked to sing at Lowe's wedding in 1981. Later that year, he said he was sexually assaulted in Lowe's car after he was invited to visit him in Yorkshire. Another victim, a former Ampleforth student, said Lowe had a 'mad-scientist look' and subjected him to 'painful' and 'bizarre' abuse during music lessons. Giving evidence, the pupil said he was just 10-years-old when he was indecently assaulted during private piano lessons in the early 1980s. He told the court: 'The bit that I remember, because it was most disturbing, was that he was pressing really quite hard, to the extent it was quite painful, in my crotch area with his hand in a sort of cup-position. 'It was painful, it was bizarre and it was inappropriate.' A former Westminster pupil also described to the jury how the former tutor rested his hands on his tummy and instructed him to 'sing using your diaphragm' during a music lesson. Married Lowe, who taught English and Maths and who now lives in Bristol, was found guilty of abusing six young boys  while teaching at Westminster Cathedral Choir School in London (above) in the 1970s and 1980s . Lowe was also convicted of abusing four young boys while working at Ampleforth College, near York (above) The Cambridge graduate then felt the boy's bottom on several occasions during the one-on-one music lesson, the court heard. The victim said he was about 10-years old when their 'disturbing' interactions began and described it as 'unequivocally sexual abuse'. The pupil, now in his 40s, said Lowe knew the attacks were 'not in the school curriculum' at the elite Catholic prep school. He said he even once begged a classmate to stay behind at the end of the lesson, because he 'didn't want to be alone with this chap David Lowe'. He pleaded with a friend: 'Stay behind with me mate, won't you?' to try and avoid Lowe in the school library, the jury was told. He told the court: 'He called me upstairs to his room and I remember thinking, ""Here we go again, I'm going to get some more of this"".' He said his memory was 'crystal clear' of Lowe telling him to take down his pants and lie across his lap while the teacher molested him. A jury of seven men and five women at Southwark Crown Court took around nine-and-a-half hours to convict the Cambridge English graduate of 15 counts of indecent assault against 10 young boys in the 1970s and 80s . Lowe then bought him sweets and whispered: 'Just remember, it's our little secret, ok?'. The victim added: 'I knew that he knew what he had just done upstairs was not in the school curriculum'. 'That is the pattern that it took.' He added that he had been molested by Lowe 'possibly a dozen times in all' but said he finally reported the abuse to police after years of silence. Another victim described how he had been in the dormitory of the Westminster school on a number of occasions when Lowe would be checking up on students at lights out and 'his hand would go into the duvet and then try to get into our bottom pyjamas'. The prosecutor quoted the victim as saying: 'I don't think they (other masters) suspected anything under their own noses. 'And yet a married man in the school was (abusing boys)...he seemed to take every opportunity when he was on duty at night to be able to touch the boys under the duvet.' Mr Bennetts also told how another victim at Ampleforth was plied with sweets and compliments for a year before the abuse began. He said the abuse began with 'massages' and then 'gradually over a period of time he would go further than just a massage'. 'During the assaults he would whisper: ""I think you're a very special boy"",' he told the court. During the trial, Southwark Crown Court (pictured) heard how former housemaster Lowe indecently assaulted some of the young boys at Westminster Cathedral Choir School as they lay in their bunks in the dormitories . One of the victims later told his mother he had been touched by Lowe, who then reported it to the then-headmaster of the Westminster school, Peter Hannigan, via a family friend. Mr Hannigan, who worked at the school between 1977 and 1995, and hired Lowe in 1978, earlier told the court: 'Mr Lowe was a good teacher. There was never anything sexual.' Lowe was finally arrested in November 2012 at his former home in Oxted, Surrey. Throughout the trial he insisted he had no sexual interest in children and claimed the only physical contact he had with boys was when he tried to help them relax. The jury heard how the housemaster left the Westminster school, based in Victoria, in 1981 after one of the victims reported the abuse. However, later that year he was offered a job at Ampleforth College, near York, where he stayed until 1988. Lowe is due to be sentenced on February 5.","David Lowe, 61, abused 10 boys aged under 14 between 1978 and 1984 .

"A Georgia man whose lawyers argue he shouldn't be executed because he is intellectually disabled, and who has come within hours of execution three times in recent years, is scheduled to die on Tuesday unless the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes. Twice-convicted murderer Warren Lee Hill, 54, is set to be put to death at 7pm at the state prison in Jackson. Different courts have intervened with temporary reprieves at the last minute on three previous occasions. Convicted murderer Warren Lee Hill, pictured in an undated mugshot. The Georgia death row inmate who has come within hours of execution three times is once again scheduled for execution on Tuesday evening. His lawyers claim he has had a lifelong intellectual disability . State and federal courts have already rejected his filings this time around, and the State Board of Pardons and Paroles - the only entity authorized to commute his sentence to life in prison - denied him clemency on Tuesday. His lawyer, Brian Kammer, told NBC: 'Mr. Hill's disability means that he has the emotional and cognitive functioning of an 11-year-old boy. 'That is why the Supreme Court has outlawed the execution of the intellectually disabled.' Hill has filings pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, which is now the only potential barrier between him and a lethal injection of the drug pentobarbital. 'The clemency board missed an opportunity to right a grave wrong,' Mr Kammer later said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. 'It is now up to the U.S. Supreme Court to ensure that an unconstitutional execution of a man with lifelong intellectual disability is prevented.' Hill was sentenced to serve life in prison for the 1986 killing of his 18-year-old girlfriend, who was shot 11 times. While serving that sentence, he beat a fellow inmate, Joseph Handspike, to death using a nail-studded board. A jury in 1991 convicted Hill of murder and sentenced him to death. Lawyers for Hill have long argued he is intellectually disabled and, therefore, shouldn't be executed. State law and a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court decision both prohibit the execution of the intellectually disabled. But Georgia has the toughest-in-the nation standard for proving intellectual disability. It requires capital defendants to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they are intellectually disabled in order to avoid execution on those grounds. The state has consistently said Hill's lawyers failed to meet that burden of proof. Hill's lawyers argued that Georgia's standard is unconstitutional because mental diagnoses are subject to a degree of uncertainty that is virtually impossible to overcome. But the standard has repeatedly been upheld by state and federal courts. In the challenge currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, Hill's lawyers have cited a ruling that court issued in May that knocked down a Florida law. The high court said defendants should have a fair opportunity to show the Constitution prohibits their execution. Hill's lawyers say that ruling should also invalidate Georgia's tough burden of proof. Hill was previously set to die in July 2012, February 2013 and July 2013, but courts stepped in at the last minute with temporary stays so they would have time to consider challenges filed by Hill's lawyers. The July 2012 and July 2013 challenges each effectively halted executions in Georgia while they were pending, for about six months and 10 months, respectively. Days before he was to be executed in February 2013, Hill's lawyers submitted new statements from the three doctors who had examined Hill in 2000 and testified at his trial that he was not intellectually disabled. In their new statements, the doctors wrote that they had been rushed at the time of Hill's trial and new scientific developments had surfaced since then. All three reviewed facts and documents in the case and wrote that they believed Hill is intellectually disabled. Included with the clemency application Hill's lawyers submitted to the parole board were letters from former President Jimmy Carter and his wife and groups that advocate for those with disabilities. In their letter dated January 21, the Carters cited the fact that Georgia was the first state, in 1988, to outlaw the execution of the mentally disabled. 'In light of the undisputed evidence that Mr. Hill is more likely than not 'mentally retarded,' his execution would undermine the State of Georgia's historic leadership in promoting the rights of the developmentally challenged,' Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter wrote.","Warren Lee Hill, 54, set to be put to death at 7pm at state prison in Jackson .

"The owner of the New England Patriots has insisted his team is innocent over 'Deflate-gate' and has called on the NFL to apologize if its probe clears them. Robert Kraft made the comments in Arizona yesterday where his team is preparing to face the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Super on Sunday. Mr Kraft said he welcomes the investigation into accusations his team deflated footballs during the first half of their AFC Championship match against the Indianapolis Colts. The owner of the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft, pictured left, with the team's coach Bill Belichick, has insisted his team is innocent over 'Deflate-gate' and has called on the NFL to apologize if its probe clears them of any wrongdoing . Kraft told a press conference in Arizona that he was confident the investigation would 'uncover the facts' and the science of how balls 'react to changes in the environment' Kraft, seen above addressing a crowd at a send-off rally in Boston yesterday, referred to Belichick, right, and quarterback Tom Brady, left, as 'my guys' and said they were 'part of my family'; he said he had never known either man to 'lie' Attorney Ted Wells is heading the investigation, along with NFL executive vice president Jeff Pash who previously conducted the league's probe of the Miami Dolphin's bullying scandal. 'If the Wells investigation is not able to definitely determine that our organization tampered with the air pressure in the footballs, I would expect and hope that the league would apologize to our entire team, and in particular, Coach Belichick and Tom Brady, for what they have had to endure this past week,' Kraft is reported as saying to NBCNews. Kraft said he was confident the investigation would 'uncover the facts' and the science of how balls 'react to changes in the environment'. He said the controversy has been fuelled by 'circumstantial leaked evidence' to the media and not 'actual data and facts', which has led to 'strong accusations' being made against Brady and  Belichick. Those allegations, which called into questions his star quarterback and coaches' integrity, 'bothers me greatly', Kraft said. Kraft said the controversy has been fuelled by 'circumstantial leaked evidence' to the media and not 'actual data and facts', which has led to 'strong accusations' being made against quaterback Tom Brady, pictured above, and Belichick . Both Brady and Belichick have publicly denied that they knowingly broke league rules during the team's AFC Championship win over the Indianapolis Colts . Kraft said he believes 'unconditionally' that his team has done 'nothing inappropriate'. Both Brady and Belichick have publicly denied that they knowingly broke league rules. 'Tom, Bill and I have been together for 15 years. They are my guys. They are part of my family. And Bill, Tom and I have had many difficult discussions over the years, and I have never known them to lie to me. That is why I am confident in saying what I just said, and it bothers me greatly that their reputations and integrity, and by association that of our team, has been called into question this past week,' Kraft told ESPN. Brady said his team was not being distracted by the controversy in the lead-up to the Super Bowl saying it had dealt with a 'lot of adversity' this season and would continue to deal with it. Meanwhile, it was revealed yesterday that the NFL is focusing its investigation on a Patriots locker room attendant. Belichick answers questions during a press conference yesterday; while the Patriots escaped a winter blizzard to make their way to the Super Bowl city of Phoenix yesterday, there was no avoiding the storm of controversy that has swirled ever since they defeated the Colts . The attendant was reportedly caught shuttling balls from the official's locker room to another room in Gillette Stadium surveillance footage before they made it to the field. League authorities are said to have interviewed the attendant at least twice as part of their continued investigation to determine why 11 of 12 balls were under-inflated during the Super Bowl securing match. The revelation may not come as a surprise to anyone who heard Brady defending his team in a press conference last week. He said: 'I have a process before every game where I take the footballs I want to use for the game. Our equipment guys do a great job breaking the balls in for the game. Our equipment guys have a process they go through.' The Patriots escaped a winter blizzard to make their way to the Super Bowl city of Phoenix yesterday, but there was no avoiding the storm of controversy that has swirled ever since they defeated the Colts. Stepping off the plane the team were greeted by hundreds of media, who wanted to grill them further on 'Deflate-gate'.","Robert Kraft said the scandal had been driven by 'circumstantial evidence'

"Max Schrems, an Austrian law student, wants compensation from Facebook for alleged breaches in privacy . An Austrian court will consider a class action against Facebook by 25,000 people who are claiming their privacy has been breached. The David v Goliath case is being spearheaded by law student Max Schrems, who wants Mark Zuckerberg’s social media site to compensate him and his supporters with a symbolic £400 each. A hearing in Vienna on April 9 will consider whether the lawsuit is admissible. Mr Schrems began his legal challenge last June, claiming that Facebook supplied personal information to the US Prism spy programme. Over the next few months 25,000 people added their names to the lawsuit. The programme is the U.S. secret service's worldwide monitoring and data mining system and was exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden last year. Mr Schrems said that the court in the Austrian capital would have the power to make a judgment in the absence of a counter-statement from the social network. Mr Schrems is claiming damages of £397 (€500) per supporter, meaning that if the case was expanded and the activists won, Facebook would have to pay out a total of £23.8m. As it stands, the company could still have to pay more than £9.9m if they lose the case. The action is being taken against the Irish subsidiary of the New York-listed web giant. The class action claims Facebook Ireland is in breach of European law on users' data and it violates rights by tracking internet use on external sites, including the use of 'like' buttons. Facebook has more than 1.3 billion users and is worth around £118bn on the stock market. Founder Mark Zuckerberg has previously denied any link between Prism and his company. Facebook told MailOnline it had no comment to make on the case. On Monday Facebook and Instagram were down worldwide for around an hour after an alleged cyber attack. The online group Lizard Squad have claimed responsibility for the hack, which took the two social media sites down at around 6am GMT. Both sites, which have a total of 1.5billion users, appeared with error messages in the United States, Europe and Asia for around an hour. But despite hackers claiming they took the social media giants offline, Zuckerberg's Facebook, which also owns Instagram, refused to say what the fault was. There were claims online that the super-snowstorm that is over America's east coast may have knocked out its servers. The allegations centre around three main concerns including: . Facebook's Graph Search - this feature lets users discover information about other member's likes and activities. External website tracking - Facebook monitors Likes on other sites through embedded buttons. Big data analysis - the social network analyses interactions to learn about member behaviours. Graph Search was launched in July 2013 and appears as a bigger search bar at the top of each page. It lets users find people who like cycling in London, for example, or which 18-year-olds in San Francisco are interested in horror films. When a user searches for something, that search not only determines the set of results they get, but also serves as a title for the page. Graph search uses the same privacy settings as a user's normal profile. The lawsuit is being taken in Vienna Regional Court against the Irish subsidiary of Facebook .

"Barack Obama's new White House video may be filled with shots of beautiful Alaska scenery, but it was a mere five seconds that got everyone talking. The minute-long film was released to announce a new push by the administration to protect a large portion of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for preservation, effectively protecting it from oil drilling. But it wasn't only the video's message that riled Republicans - it was the fact the clip featured Obama explaining the new initiative while en route to India on Air Force One, an aircraft with a fuel capacity of 53,611 gallons. Scroll down for video . President Obama was criticized after a new White House video announcing his administration's push to protect a large portion of Alaska's Artic National Wildlife Refuge featured him on Air Force One . 'Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge is an incredible place — pristine, undisturbed' Obama begins in the video as various shots of Alaska's wildlife and landscapes skate by . 'Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge is an incredible place — pristine, undisturbed,' Obama begins in the video as various shots of Alaska's wildlife and landscapes skate by. 'It supports caribou and polar bears, all manner of marine life, countless species of birds and fish, and for centuries it supported many Alaska Native communities. But it's very fragile. 'That's why I'm very proud my Department of Interior has put forth a comprehensive plan to make sure we're protecting the refuge and designating new areas, including Coastal Plains, for preservation. 'And I'm going to be calling on Congress to make sure they take it one step further, designating it as a wilderness so we can make sure this amazing wonder is preserved for future generations.' The plan, which would protect 12 million acres of the Artic National Wildlife Refuge from oil drilling, has angered Republicans in the state and Washington alike. Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the new chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee,  said the move 'effectively declared war on Alaska', Politico reported. 'It supports caribou and polar bears, all manner of marine life, countless species of birds and fish, and for centuries it supported many Alaska Native communities. But it's very fragile,' he said . Obama then announces the Department of Interior has 'put forth a comprehensive plan to make sure we're protecting the refuge and designating new areas, including Coastal Plains, for preservation' 'What's coming is a stunning attack on our sovereignty and our ability to develop a strong economy that allows us, our children and our grandchildren to thrive,' she later said in a joint statement with other legislators in the state. 'It's clear this administration does not care about us, and sees us as nothing but a territory. We will fight back with every resource at our disposal.' Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan called the move 'just one more example of President Obama thumbing his nose at the citizens of a sovereign state' and said it 'will put Alaska and America’s energy security in serious jeopardy.' Just days before Obama released his video, Sen. Murkowski introduced a bill to permit oil production in the refuge. The White House has defended the proposed expansion in a blog post written by presidential counselor John Podesta and Mike Boots, head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. 'The Obama administration believes that oil and natural gas resources can be developed safely. Unfortunately, accidents and spills can still happen,' they write. 'The Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge, one of the few remaining places in the country as pristine today as it was when the oldest Alaska Native communities first set eyes on it, is too precious to put at risk. 'By designating the area as wilderness, Congress could preserve the Coastal Plain in perpetuity — ensuring that this wild, free, beautiful, and bountiful place remains in trust for Alaska Natives and for all Americans.' The plan, which would protect 12 million acres of the Artic National Wildlife Refuge from oil drilling, has angered Republicans in the state and Washington alike . Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the new chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the move 'effectively declared war on Alaska' Environmental groups likewise heralded the move, which would protect a site that is vital for Alaska's wildlife. 'This wilderness recommendation has been a long time coming for the place where life begins for the porcupine caribou herd and for many of America's polar bears,' Center for Biological Diversity Alaska director Rebecca Noblin said. Jamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, said in a released statement: 'Some places are simply too special to drill, and we are thrilled that a federal agency has acknowledged that the refuge merits wilderness protection.' Democrats and Republicans have debated oil drilling in the region, which is currently off-limits and is estimated to hold 10.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil, since the 1970s. Congress has tried and failed repeatedly to get legislation to open up the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain to drilling in the past. It came closest in 1995, when President Bill Clinton vetoed it. Obama wouldn't be any more receptive if Congress passed legislation again and his wilderness designation will require Congress' approval too. And Republicans in Congress, already critical of the administration on its energy policies on federal lands, are just as unlikely to give Obama what he wants. But the president's new initiative is just the beginning of a series of decisions that the Interior Department could make this week concerning the state's oil and gas production, the Washington Post reports. The department will also consider whether to impose additional limits on oil and gas production in parts of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, as well as the Artic Ocean. But environmental groups  heralded the move and said 'some places are simply too special to drill' Congress has tried and failed repeatedly to get legislation to open up the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain, which is estimated to hold 10.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil,  to drilling in the past .","Clip announced administration's push to protect large portion of Alaska's Artic National Wildlife Refuge .

"Ministers were accused of effectively trying to bribe voters last night after showering cash on marginal seats. The accusation came as they fanned out across the country to promote details of a new £36million investment in coastal areas. Of the 28 identifiable constituencies receiving money, almost two-thirds are in marginal constituencies. Some 23 of the 28 seats are held by Coalition parties. With 100 days to go, the election is not so much a phoney war as an endless series of photo opportunities for the parties. Yesterday, David Cameron and George Osborne helped out at a cider farm in Somerset (above) The Prime Minister (pictured) and his Conservative party are keen to talk up job creation and the economy . In one case, Liberal Democrat health minister Norman Lamb was dispatched to his own constituency in North Norfolk to announce a £500,000 grant to improve his local railway station. Ministers also visited marginal seats in Lancashire, Kent and Devon. Downing Street was also facing questions about why the taxpayer is picking up travel bills for David Cameron and George Osborne when they make campaign visits to marginal seats. Labour Cabinet Office spokesman Jon Ashworth said ministers appeared to be pursuing ‘pork barrel politics’ – a reference to the US practice of effectively bribing voters by pouring money into marginal seats. He said: ‘The Tories are pumping public cash into their electoral battlegrounds. We know that ministers are visiting key seats on official visits and ramping up advertising budgets in time for the election. ‘Ministers need to come clean and justify this expenditure. 'They must prove this is in the public interest, not just the electoral interest of the Tory Party.’ Downing Street yesterday denied the seaside grants and visits amounted to ‘electioneering’. Meanwhile, Ed Miliband, who is keen to underline his emphasis on the NHS, visited a hospital in Warwickshire . UKIP leader Nigel Farage appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr show where he discussed his party's views . The general election is just 100 days away and the coming days will see Mr Cameron (pictured left), Lib Dem Nick Clegg (centre) and Labour's Ed Miliband (right) battle it out on the campaign trail with their fellow parties . The NHS faces its most ‘perilous moment in a generation’ at May’s general election, Ed Miliband will warn today. The Labour leader will say his is the only party which has pledged to increase health spending – from the proceeds of its controversial mansion tax – while the Tories want to make further public sector cuts. Speaking at the first NHS hospital in Trafford, near Manchester, Mr Miliband will claim the Tories have caused a ‘crisis’ in the health service and that a second term for Prime Minister David Cameron could ‘leave it unrecognisable’. A spokesman said: ‘The Coastal Communities fund is benefiting regions across the UK. 'It’s important that the government is out there across the country today highlighting that.’ The Prime Minister and Chancellor are also facing mounting questions over their policy of mixing party and government events to ensure their travel bills are met by the taxpayer. Yesterday, for example, Mr Cameron made an ‘official’ visit to a rubber factory in Hampshire, before making a party political speech in nearby Southampton. He then travelled to Somerset where he and George Osborne visited two top Tory target seats. Their ‘official’ business included a photo opportunity as they tipped apples into a cider-making machine. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘As a protected individual, travel costs for the Prime Minister are met by the government, other than exclusively political events or personal holidays. 'Where there are events organised by the party they are paid for by the party.’","Ministers have visited marginal constituencies in Norfolk, Kent and Devon .

"In this day and age of Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest and so on, it seems digital photos are widely preferred to their physical counterparts. But those who still pine for the day of physical photographs can get the best of both worlds, by turning their smartphone into a polaroid camera. The Prynt Case attaches to a variety of phones and lets a user print images in 30 seconds - while augmented reality can also turn the printed pictures into videos. Scroll down for video . A San Francisco-based company has revealed their Prynt device. It attaches to certain smartphones and lets users print physical photos. Users can print out screen-sized pictures in about 30 seconds (shown) The device was developed by a team based in San Francisco, California, who are currently seeking funding on Kickstarter. Costing around £65 ($99), the device will ship to backers in August of this year. Instant camera film features layers of colours of light. These layers sit on top of a black base layer and beneath an image, timing and acid layer. When the shot is taken, a small amount of reagent material is rolled onto the film sheet, which reacts with chemicals in the film. These chemicals move downward through the layers, dissolving the developer dye so it moves towards the image layer. Metallic silver areas on each layer, which were exposed to light when the photo was taken, capture the dye so it is distributed throughout the photo, to match the colours of the scene photographed. The acid layer in the film reacts with the alkali and opacifiers in the reagent, making the opacifiers become clear, and this is what makes the image appear. Source: How Stuff Works . The Prynt Case attaches to smartphones like an ordinary case, and to print images, users simply snap a picture and then press print, using an app for the device. Perhaps one of its more intriguing features, though, is the ability to turn photos into augmented reality pictures. Users can record a video using the Prynt app and then print it out as a photo. When they scan the photo with their phone, they can then ‘play’ the photo as a video on the phone’s screen. Prynt is compatible with the iPhone 5, 5S, 5C, 6 and Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5. The device doesn’t use ink to print the photos, instead ‘embedding’ the photos into the paper, something known as 'instant film'. Each additional pack of ten sheets of paper to print photos on will cost £3.30 ($5). The device also doesn’t require Bluetooth or WiFi, with instead the phone simply plugging in to the device. And it has its own internal battery, so it does not need to draw power from your phone. Users can record a video using the Prynt app and then print it out as a photo.

"Fishermen working off the coast of Taiwan have dredged up the jawbone of an ancient human ancestor that lived in the area around 200,000 years ago. The short, thick mandible has unusually large teeth and a strong jaw compared to other human fossils found in East Asia, according to anthropologists. The discovery suggests that it belonged to an previously unknown ancient human lineage. The fossilised lower jawbone (above) was dredged up in a fishing net 15 miles off the west coast of Taiwan . Experts say it means that there may have been several species of early human living in Asia until modern humans arrived 55,000 years ago. The fossilised jawbone is the first ancient hominin remains to be found in Taiwan. An ancient relative of humans has been dubbed 'Nutcracker Man' because of his powerful jaws and huge teeth. Paranthropus boisei lived in Africa more than one million years ago and lived side-by-side with direct ancestors of humans. It has long been assumed that this species lived on a diet of nuts, seeds and hard fruit because of its powerful jaw muscles and the biggest and flattest molars of any known hominid in the anthropological record. The latest research has compared the teeth of these ancient human relatives with those of modern sea otters - known for their ability to crack through the hard shells of mussels and other shellfish. Dr Adam van Casteren, a research fellow who led the study at the Max Planck Weizmann Center for Integrative Archaeology and Anthropology, found that P. boisei had tooth enamel that was remarkably similar in structure to those of sea otters. Tests on otter teeth suggest that the teeth of these ancient humans could have withstood extremely high pressures and could mean they had powerful bite capable of destroying bone, nuts and other hard foods. It was dredged up in a fishing net from the Penghu submarine channel, about 15 miles (25km) off the west coast of Taiwan. During the Pliestocene between 2.5 million and 11,000 years ago, periods of low sea level would have meant the area was part of the mainland of Asia. Anthropologists from the National Museum of Natural Science in Taiwan and the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo who studied the newly discovered fossils say it is unlike any of the other fossilised ancient humans that spread through out Asia. Homo erectus, remains of which have been found in Java, Indonesia, and mainland China, tended to have much narrower jawbones and smaller teeth. Researchers say that this suggests the robust-jawed 'Penghu man' had a different evolutionary origin from the 'classic' Homo erectus found in the area. It could mean that it is either an entirely new species or a rare subgroup of Homo erectus. Dr. Yousuke Kaifu, an anthropologist at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo who was involved in the study, told MailOnline: 'It is a well-preserved mandible - a small fragment but contains a lot of information useful to evaluate its evolutionary position. 'What we can say is that it is clearly different from the known Homo erectus populations from northern China and Java, and likely represent a group that has been so far unrecognized so.' He added that the species would have looked very different from modern humans. He said: ''The new Taiwan mandible is markedly different from us in robusticity, not size, of the mandible. 'Width of the bone at the lateral part of the mandible is 20.7 mm (0.8 inches) for Penghu, but on average 14 mm (0.55 inches) for fossil modern humans.' Dr Chun-Hsiang Chang, who led the research at the National Museum of Natural Science,  said the fossil appeared to have quite a primitive jaw but belonged to a now extinct species that most likely lived at a time when more anatomically modern humans were around. He said the fossil either belonged to a new type of ancient hominin not previously identified or was the result of more robustly jawed immigrants from Africa moving into the region. He added that the discovery also suggests that the traditional view of Homo erectus as the only ancient human species living on the eastern Asian continent until the arrival of modern man is incorrect and it may have in fact shared the area with many other human lineages. The Penghu mandible (centre) found off the coast of Taiwan is much larger than the lower jawbones of Homo erectus from Java (left) and China (right), despite its much younger age according to the researchers . The Penghu Channel (seen above), where the jawbone was found, was once been part of mainland Asia . Dr Chang said most mandibles from Homo erectus from the early and middle Pleistocene in Asia had much thinner mandible bones and smaller molars. He said: 'Several different models can be proposed to explain this situation. First, such morphology may be primitive retention from earlier Asian Homo. 'This hypothesis implies the presence of another longstanding Homo lineage in Asia that continued from the Early Pleistocene. 'Otherwise, there may have been a migration of robust-jawed Homo from Africa, possibly bringing along Acheulean stone tool technology around the terminal Early Pleistocene, who later evolved some unique morphology locally. 'Both hypotheses cast doubt on the traditional view that H. erectus was the sole hominin species on the Asian continent in the Early to early Middle Pleistocene.' Scientists used CT scanning to create the virtual reconstruction above of the jawbone discovered in Pinghu . The teeth, seen here in CT scans, were much larger than those seen in other fossils but extensively worn . The fossil was found by local fishermen when pulling up their nets, who then sold it to a local antique shop, where collector Kun-Yu Tsai purchased it. Tsai donated his collection to the National Museum of Natural Science in Taiwan, where Dr Chang works. Analysis of the fossil, published in the journal Nature Communications, show that it is an almost complete right side of the mandible, with many of the molar and premolar teeth still in place. However, the molars were found to be extensively worn and scientists hope this may help to provide clues about what this ancient human species may have eaten. The wear also suggests that the jaw belonged to an older adult. The sockets where the incisor teeth would have sat could also be seen. Although scientists struggled to accurately date the age of the fossilised jaw found off the coast of Taiwan, using sea level data and information about vegetation, they were able to estimate its age using isotopes found in the fossil. They say it is no older than 450,000 years and is probably younger than 190,000 years and could even be as young as 10,000 years old. With such a large age range, it is difficult to pin down exactly where in the evolutionary tree the fossil may fit and opens up the possibility that it may have come into contact with modern man, Homo sapiens, which moved into Asia around 55,000-40,000 years ago. Scientists have yet to obtain DNA from the fossilised jawbone, but if they were able to, this could help them work out which species it is most closely related to. During their study, the scientists found that the teeth are much larger than other Homo erectus fossils found in Asia at the time when the new species is thought to have been alive. Instead they more resembled the teeth of fossils that were 400,000 to 800,000 years old. In general the jaws and teeth of ancient human species grow smaller over time. Yet this jaw was found to be much larger than those of other species living at the time. This graphic above shows how the Penghu 1 fossil may fit into the complex timeline of human evolution . Homo erectus remains, like the one above, have been dated to between 1.6 million and 500,000 years ago . The scientists claim that it is similar to remains of another robust-jawed fossil, identified as an early Homo erectus , in Hexian, in the Anhui Province of China.The new finding suggests that these may belong to another unique branch of the human tree. Some anthropologists, however, believe that it may be the remains of a sister group of the Neatherthals known as the Denisovan, which lived in Siberian Asia. Professor Chris Stringer, research leader in human origins at the Natural History Museum in London who was not involved in the latest study, said: 'This enigmatic fossil is difficult to classify, but it highlights the growing and not unexpected evidence of human diversity in the Far East, with the apparent co-existence of different lineages in the region prior to, and perhaps even contemporary with, the arrival of modern humans some 55,000 years ago.' He added: 'The jawbone also has some resemblances to even earlier H. erectus fossils from Africa, Java and Dmanisi (in Georgia), and to some Homo heidelbergensis fossils from Africa and Europe. 'But it does not sit easily in the latter samples, nor with other later Pleistocene archaic Chinese fossils such as Dali, Jinniushan and Xujiayao. The new fossil had a larger and more powerful jaw than this forensic reconstruction of Homo erectus . 'One plausible comparison is with the Siberian 'Denisovans', known from ancient DNA recovered from a fragmentary fossil finger bone and two very large molar teeth. 'If Penghu is indeed a long-awaited Denisovan jawbone, it looks more primitive than I would have expected.' Other scientists have said that the fossil could be an unusually enlarged example from an existing species as skull sizes are known to vary considerably within species. Dr Simon Underdown, principal lecturer in anthropology at Oxford Brookes University and vice president of the Royal Anthropological Institute, warned against rushing to attribute this fossil to a new species. He said: 'The discovery of this jaw in the fishing nets of a vessel off Taiwan while not a normal form of archaeological excavation is an exciting find. 'While the authors of the paper suggest that it could represent a new species of Homo, because it’s teeth are unlike other Asian Homo erectus, we should be careful before adding this fossil to a new species and attaching it to the family tree. 'The analysis of several Homo erectus skulls from Dmanisi in Georgia published in 2013 show that a huge amount of variation can exist in one species and reminds us that we should always take care when dealing with isolated individual fossils.'","Unusually thick lower jawbone with large teeth found 15 miles out to sea .

"Three police officers have been placed on paid leave after a 17-year-old girl with a history of mental illness was shot dead in the lobby of a Texas police station . Kristina Coignard entered the lobby of the police station in Longview on Thursday evening and used an assistance phone to tell a communications employees she needed an officer. Officers responded to the lobby and 'were confronted by a white female who threatened them'. Coignard then 'brandished a weapon and 'made threatening movements'. She was shot four times. Kristina Coignard, 17,  was shot dead after entering the lobby of the police station in Longview, Texas and 'brandishing a weapon'. It is believed that she had a knife . After Coignard was shot four times in the station on Thursday (pictured), three Longview police officers were placed on paid leave on Friday . She was brought to Good Shepherd Medical Center and pronounced dead by a Justice of the Peace. Texas Department of Public Safety officials have declined to identify the weapon, but Longview Mayor Jay Dean was told a 'female wielding a knife entered into the police department', according to the Marshall News Messenger. Three Longview police officers were placed on paid leave after the shooting and the Texas Rangers were called in to investigate the incident. Coignard was living with her aunt, Heather Robertson, before her death. Robertson said her niece had been battling mental illness, including bipolar disorder and depression, and that the teenager had been hospitalized twice following suicide attempts,Think Progress reported. She said Coignard 'was only violent with herself' and has questions about what happened. 'I think it was a cry for help. I think they could have done something.' 'They are grown men. I think there is something they are not telling us.' Coignard's aunt said her niece was struggling with mental illness but she was 'only violent to herself' Officials from the Longview Police Department have confirmed there is a video of the shooting. The station did close after the incident, but it has been re-opened. Longview police officers were involved in two shootings last year. A 15-year-old boy was killed in one and a 23-year-old man was killed in the other. Officers in both 2014 cases were cleared by a grand jury. The Longview Police Department has been using its Facebook page to release updates about the shooting and the investigation. Some people have been leaving inappropriate comments  and the department issued a reminder that the page is not a forum to 'bash others, their education, or life experiences.' More information should be on the way soon: . Three Longview police officers were placed on paid leave following the shooting death of Kristina Coignard . 'Once the investigation is complete the Texas Rangers and/or the Gregg County District Attorney will release further information about this incident and then everyone will be able to have the information available to make a decision that can be more accurate than what they would be able to make based on the limited information furnished at this time.' Jason Robertson, who identified himself as Coignard's uncle, wrote: . 'I am the uncle of Kristiana, for quite a few years my niece suffered from mental illness. 'It hurt to see all the comments said about her. 'They didn't know that she had these problems, seeing her berated by quite a few people has hurt me and my family. 'I please ask that you pray for my family and not judge her for what she had done. 'She is now in a better place with her mother.

"For those trying to cut down on salt, bacon is usually off limits – but a new version may put it back on the menu. From next month, Danepak's six-rasher packs of smoked and unsmoked bacon will contain 30 per cent less salt, according to The Grocer magazine. The products are aimed at millions of Britons who eat too much salt – which can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease and strokes. Danepak's new six-rasher packs of smoked and unsmoked bacon will contain 30 per cent less salt . The new versions contain two per sent salt compared with 3.3 per cent found in the brand's smoked bacon . Danepak owner Tulip said it had developed a curing process that uses Iposol – 'a solution of water and sea salt' – to give the same flavour as conventional bacon in a healthier way. The new versions contain 2 per cent salt compared with the 2.9 per cent and 3.3 per cent previously found in the brand's standard unsmoked and smoked bacon respectively, The Grocer reported. Salt content of own-label bacon at the big four supermarkets varies from around 2.5 per cent to 4.3 per cent. Tulip senior brand and licensing manager Simon Harrington said: 'Our unique curing process is an industry first and we are excited by the additional sales opportunities our newly developed technology will offer our retail and food service customers.'

"New York commuters who faced an inconvenient trudge through freezing snowfall this morning might be surprised to learn that they don't have their city's mayor to blame. Bill de Blasio did a quick sidestep of responsibility for the complete shutdown of subways, buses, trains and ferries today and instead pointed the finger at NY Governor Andrew Cuomo for the decision. During a press conference on Tuesday, Mayor de Blasio said: 'We found out just as it was being announced. We did not get a lot of advance notice.' New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (left) said he knew little about the subway shutdown ahead of Governor Andrew Cuomo (right) making an announcement on Monday related to the storm . The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's network - which includes all subway and bus lines, Metro-North and Long Island Railroad, along with the Staten Island Ferry - was completely shut down from 11pm on Monday until 9am Tuesday as the city braced for up to 2 feet of snow and hurricane-strength winds. De Blasio came in for serious flak on Tuesday when New York awoke to several inches of snow - a light dusting compared to what it usually receives each winter and nowhere near the 'historic' event that the mayor had threatened. However he was defiant and unapologetic this morning for the extreme precautions - including closing all roads to non-emergency vehicles - saying that forecasts across the board had predicted 2 feet of snow and that New York had 'dodged a bullet'. The mayor said: 'We did what was necessary to keep everyone safe...This is a better safe than sorry scenario.' Back to business: Commuters board the first 7 train to arrive at Queensboro Plaza station in Queens on Tuesday morning shortly after a nine-hour shutdown was lifted. There were grumbles from New Yorkers that shutting down the entire transit network was not necessary . The highest snowfall recorded in the New York City area about around 12 inches at LaGuardia Airport while eastern Queens received close to ten inches. Central Park saw about six inches of snow. De Blasio told a Tuesday press conference that he was right to be cautious after the city didn't react quick enough to a massive storm in 2010. Governor Cuomo echoed de Blasio's sentiments that the city had taken the appropriate action when faced with a brutal forecast for winter storm Juno. Cuomo added: 'The plows have been working, salt trucks have been working, but it is not to be taken lightly. 'We're not saying that you should go out unless you really need to go out.' Cuomo said many areas had received two feet of snow - particularly in New England - and that Long Island had been battered but New York city experienced less damage. City schools which were closed on Tuesday were due to reopen on Wednesday. The MTA reported that it will run a Sunday service today (about 40 per cent less than usual) and be back to full service on Wednesday. City workers salt and scrape the subway steps at Astor Place in downtown Manhattan as MTA announced that a reduced service was back on track on Tuesday .","Bill de Blasio said he only heard that the transit network would be shut immediately before Governor Andrew Cuomo's announcement on Monday .
Subways, buses, trains and ferries were suspended in New York from 11pm Monday until 9am Tuesday .
Forecasts had been for 2 feet of snow - in fact, snowfall in NYC was only a couple of inches ."
