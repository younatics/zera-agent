"(CNN) -- When Billy Beane, the subject of the 2004 book 'Moneyball', took over as the general manager of the Oakland Athletics in the late 1990s, he revolutionized the way baseball teams were run. At a time when other managers and scouts relied on their experience to identify promising new players, Beane successfully used 'sabermetrics' -- the statistical analysis of baseball -- to see value in players other teams had passed over, turning the Athletics into a team capable of competing with the biggest names in the sport. Now industry watchers say a similar statistics revolution is going on in the business world. Technological advances are giving rise to huge amounts of data -- about consumers, supply chains and world events -- that businesses can use to make better decisions and gain a competitive edge. It's called 'big data analytics', and those who ignore it are being warned they risk being left behind. Watch: Funding 80 start-ups at once . The rise of big data . ""Big data is the new oil,"" says Andy Cutler, director of strategy at SAS, a consulting firm specializing in big data analytics. ""The folks who are going to get good value are those who are going to be able to refine it and turn it into useful products."" Firms like Amazon and Netflix are at the forefront of this revolution, gathering the huge amounts of data generated by their customers and analyzing it to predict what customers will want to buy or watch in the future. This goes beyond personalized purchase suggestions; Amazon is currently working on technology that will deliver products to you before you've even ordered them, or at least keep them in warehouses nearby in anticipation, says Phil Simon, author of ""Too Big to Ignore: The Business Case for Big Data."" Netflix has effectively built its entire business model on analyzing customer data, he says. ""Netflix track every view, every click, all in an attempt to understand what their customers want."" The development of smartphone technologies and near-field communication means analyzing customer data is no longer limited to the online world. Tailored buying experience . Arne Strauss, analytics professor at the Warwick Business School, says retailers are developing ways of monitoring customers as they enter physical stores, allowing them to optimize store layout and even change on-shelf promotions depending on which customer is walking by. But predicting customer behavior is just one application. Major banks including HSBC use big data to monitor and predict fraud -- both by cardholders and staff -- by setting up data-mining systems that collect patterns and look for anomalies. The investment bank Morgan Stanley uses statistical models to measure the impact market events have on the bank in real time. Improving the efficiency of large logistical operations is another use. Delivery firm UPS spends more than $1bn a year gathering data from its fleet of trucks to ensure the most efficient delivery routes. Meanwhile major supermarkets in the UK are turning to big data analytics to help them provide same-day grocery delivery services -- a huge logistical challenge involving predicting what customers are likely to want before they order it, and ensuring coordinated delivery times that protect supermarkets' already-thin profit margins. Consultants and academics say businesses who don't jump on the big data bandwagon are at risk of falling behind. But there are challenges. Too much information? Some in the industry fear a backlash from consumers uncomfortable with the amount of individual data being gathered about them, stifling development in some areas. The speed of the technological development has also created a skills gap. Professor Thierry Chaussalet, who runs a business intelligence and analytics masters course at the University of Westminster in London, says many businesses simply don't understand the big data technology now available and what it has to offer. Stephen Mills, an associate partner in big data analytics at IBM, agrees there needs to be a culture change. ""The technology is the easy bit,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- Nelson Mandela, hailed for leading South Africa out of decades of apartheid, always said he wanted to be remembered as part of a collective and not in isolation. ""We understand it still that there is no easy road to freedom. We know it well that none of us acting alone can achieve lasting success. We must therefore act together as a united people for national reconciliation, for nation building, for the birth of a new world,"" said Mandela in his inauguration speech when he became South Africa's first black president in 1994. He had spent 27 years in prison for his fight for democracy and racial equality.

"Washington (CNN) -- As the administration considers what executive actions President Barack Obama can take on immigration, the central question is how far can he go? Obama said on June 30 that he had asked the attorney general and the secretary of Homeland Security to look into the steps he can take, within the confines of the Constitution, to ""fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own."" The President expects to receive their recommendations before the end of the summer and intends to adopt them without delay. He said he was taking this step because Congress -- particularly House Republicans -- had not acted on comprehensive immigration reform. At a news conference on Wednesday, Obama said the American people want to see action on the issue. ""What I can do is scour our authorities to try to make progress,"" he said. ""And we're going to make sure that every time we take one of these steps that we are working within the confines of my executive power. But I promise you the American people don't want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for Congress to get something done."" Advocates and analysts say the legal answer might be different than the political one. What's being considered . At the top of the list of options is an expansion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It allows immigrants brought here illegally as children to stay without fear of deportation and apply for work permits if they meet certain criteria. So far, some 660,000 young people have taken advantage of the program, according to a report by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. That's 55% of the 1.2 million who were immediately eligible. Half a dozen advocates involved in conversations with White House and Department of Homeland Security officials studying the matter believe the President could expand deportation relief to potentially millions more undocumented immigrants by expanding DACA. GOP-led House authorizes lawsuit against Obama . Advocates say the administration is considering expanding DACA to cover the parents of U.S. citizens or all undocumented parents. The White House could also decide to cover undocumented immigrants in industries such as farming, or it could expand relief based on how long a person has been living and working in the community. While there are many different mechanisms that could be used to provide deportation relief, using the existing DACA program as the template is an attractive alternative because that process has been up and running since 2012. ""We think the administration should be looking at the most expansive relief that's possible given that we're talking about people who have very strong ties to the community and they are woven into these communities and they have really strong equities,"" said Laura Vazquez, the legislative analyst for the Immigration Policy Project at the National Council of La Raza. Several groups are pushing the President to expand the DACA program for all those who would have been allowed to stay under the comprehensive immigration overhaul legislation the Senate passed in June 2013 but stalled in the House. That would mean an estimated 6 million to 9 million people could qualify, advocates say. ""He could protect 9 million people in the estimation of our legal beagles who've looked at this,"" said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice. Sharry was one of several advocates who attended a meeting with Obama on June 30. He said the president appeared ready to take bold, aggressive action on the issue. Legal considerations . Groups such as America's Voice, backed by legal experts, say the President is on solid legal ground to expand DACA, even to the millions that would have qualified for relief under the Senate bill. They say that's because deferred action -- a type of prosecutorial discretion that grants some undocumented immigrants relief from deportation on a case-by-case basis -- is a well-established practice under existing immigration law. ""He has the authority to decide who to prosecute,"" said Josh Bernstein, immigration policy and strategy director at the Service Employees International Union. ""As long as he is following the laws that Congress has passed, he has broad discretion in terms of how to do that."" With Congress divided, Obama to go his own way on immigration . Hiroshi Motomura, an immigration law professor at UCLA and author of the new book ""Immigration Outside the Law,"" said there are legal limits on the President's authority over immigration law. For instance, he can't change the rules for noncitizens to become permanent residents or put them on a path to citizenship because Congress sets those rules. But he said none of these limits stands in the way of expanding DACA as long as it's done correctly. Setting priorities about who to deport, such as focusing on violent criminals, is necessary because Congress does not appropriate enough money to deport all of the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, advocates say. ""Congress created a system that has resulted in 11 million [people] in the United States without legal status,"" Motomura said. ""Handed this situation, it's unavoidable that the President exercises discretionary choices about enforcement. In doing so, he is on solid ground using a DACA-like approach for a larger group, making case-by-case individual decisions after a group of people qualifies under threshold criteria."" Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service now at the Migration Policy Institute, said it's theoretically true that the administration could expand DACA to cover as many people as would have been covered in the Senate bill. But he said there are a lot of other issues the administration's lawyers have to consider when deciding just how much to expand the program. Those include how likely it is that they would be sued by opponents and whether those opponents would have standing to argue they were harmed. Another big question the White House must consider is what kind of precedent a big, bold move could set not just for future undocumented immigrants but for the exercise of executive power on other issues such as environmental policy and enforcement of civil rights laws. ""There's just an enormous amount of jurisprudence and legal analysis that lawyers are going to bring to help inform the decisions on this issue because it is very high stakes,"" Meissner said. ""One always is concerned in the executive branch about the precedent that gets set where your successors are concerned. Depending on where you are politically, what may seem like a gift in the hands of the opposing party becomes a hammer."" Political considerations . Another big question is how much of a political backlash the White House is willing to endure. ""Many groups, including ours, have said, 'You know, it would really be awesome to use that [Senate bill] as a template,' "" Sharry said. ""Most of us think he's not gonna go that far, not because of a lack of legal authority, but because the political constraints are bigger than the legal limitations."" Many Democrats, led by members from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, have long pushed for the President to use his powers to curb deportations. ""He has alternatives under existing law,"" Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois and CHC Immigration Task Force chairman, said on the House floor earlier this year. ""There are concrete ways within existing law to help keep families together and spare U.S. citizens from losing their wives, their husbands and their children to deportation. In spite of your lack of action."" Obama impeachment talk just political theater . But the White House has already gotten a sampling of the kind of response any announcement of executive actions on immigration is likely to get from Republicans in Congress. House Speaker John Boehner said the President's moves would create incentive for more illegal crossings and would be a ""grave mistake."" ""If the President takes these actions, he'll be sealing the deal on his legacy -- legacy of lawlessness,"" Boehner said in July. ""He'll be violating the solemn oath he made to the American people on the day of his inauguration and he'll be sacrificing the integrity of our laws on the altar of political opportunism and I can guarantee you, the American people will hold him accountable."" House Republicans, many of whom have accused Obama of being an imperial president, have already voted to sue the President, charging he overstepped his authority in implementing the Affordable Care Act. And it isn't just Republicans who are questioning the President's plan. An August 6 Washington Post editorial also weighed in. ""Obstinate, hopelessly partisan and incapable of problem-solving, Congress is a mess. But that doesn't grant the President license to tear up the Constitution,"" the paper's editorial board wrote. ""As Mr. Obama himself said last fall: 'If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But we're also a nation of laws.' To act on his own, the President said, would violate those laws."" The paper predicted that extending deportation relief to millions of undocumented immigrants could trigger a constitutional showdown with congressional Republicans.","After Congress failed to act, Obama is considering executive actions on immigration issues .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States predicts the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, likely by pro-Russian rebels, will fundamentally shift the relationship between Russia and the international community. ""It is a game-changer,"" one senior State Department official said. While Washington has stopped short of blaming Russia, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said Friday the United States believes the jet carrying nearly 300 people was downed by a surface-to-air missile fired by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. U.S.: Russia may have helped operate system . Due to the sophistication of the Buk missile system believed to have been used, Power said it was ""unlikely that the separatists could effectively operate the system without assistance from knowledgeable personnel."" That means ""we cannot rule out technical assistance from Russian personnel in operating the systems,"" she added. Is there a Russian cover-up? Officials said regardless of whether Russian operatives were manning the system, Russia bears responsibility for the attack because of its military and political support for the rebels. In recent weeks, Russia has intensified its delivery of sophisticated military equipment, officials said. ""While it may take us some time to firmly establish who shot down a plane filled with innocents, most (U.N. Security Council) members and most members of the international community have been warning for months about the devastation that would come if Russia did not stop what it started, if it did not rein in what it unleashed,"" Power said. Another senior U.S. official said that the ""responsibility is Russia's whether they had Russian personnel there or they gave them equipment and an instruction manual"" on what to do. ""These separatist leaders are taking orders from Russia and (Russian President Vladimir Putin) has to realize the consequence of sending heavy and sophisticated weapons to a gang of sociopaths, extremists, violent thugs, nationalists and agents who are just given weapons and told to make chaos,"" the official said. Why was the jet there? The same official said that over the past 24 hours, Moscow has played ""the usual game of deflection,"" noting it has put out ""nonsense stories to send people down a rabbit hole"" and hamper the investigation. ""It's not going to work,"" the official said. ""The outrage is too deep and the evidence, including videos of separatists bragging about this, is too damning. They will have a hard time explaining this away."" President Barack Obama warned that without a stop in support to the rebels, Putin would face more international sanctions. The administration this week escalated sanctions on key business sectors of the Russian economy over Ukraine. Putin and the Russian government ""have to make a strategic decision,"" Obama said on Friday. ""Are they going to continue to support violent separatists whose intent is to undermine the government of Ukraine? Or are they prepared to work with the government of Ukraine to arrive at a cease fire and a peace that takes into account the interests of all Ukrainians?"" U.S. officials said it was unclear whether the incident could be a turning point in Russia's support for the rebels, but stressed a tough message would be sent to Putin once the final determination is made about what happened regarding Malaysia Air Flight 17. How will Putin respond ultimately, especially on personnel and weapons sent to Ukraine? ""If he ever had an intention of backing off, this could be an opportunity for him to do that,"" another U.S. official said. ""I don't think he does have that intention, though."" Officials noted, however, the tragedy would likely close any gap between the United States and the European Union over how severe the international response should be toward Russia. ""This is very likely to harden views that Russia is not a problem,"" one official said. ""If there were any Europeans who believe it had nothing to do with them, that Ukraine was merely a local issue, that will change.""

"(CNN) -- When she was 12, Jennifer Traig's hands were red and raw from washing them so much. She'd start scrubbing a half an hour before dinner; when she was done, she'd hold her hands up like a surgeon until her family sat down to eat. Her handwashing compulsions began at the time she was studying for her Bat Mitzvah. She was so worried about being exposed to pork fumes that she cleaned her shoes and barrettes in a washing machine. ""Like a lot of people with OCD, I tended to obsess about cleanliness,"" said Traig, now 42. ""But because I was reading various Torah portions, I was obsessed with a biblical definition of cleanliness."" Family dinners were awkward for Tina Fariss Barbour, too, as an adolescent. She would concentrate so hard on praying for forgiveness that if anyone tried to interrupt her thoughts, she wouldn't respond. ""First I had to get rid of all my sins, ask forgiveness, do it in the right way, and then I had to pray for protection,"" said Barbour, now 50. ""Or, if something bad happened to my family, it would be my fault because I had not prayed good enough."" The women come from different faith backgrounds: Barbour is Methodist and Traig is Jewish. But as children they believed fervently that they needed to conduct their own rituals and prayers, or else disaster would befall their families. Both women say they suffered from a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder known as scrupulosity. A fear of sin or punishment from deities characterizes this condition, said Jonathan Abramowitz, professor and associate chairman of the department of psychology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or OCD, involves unwanted thoughts (""obsessions"") and accompanying behaviors called compulsions that patients use to reduce anxiety. In scrupulosity, the obsessions have a religious or moral underpinning. Patients with scrupulosity often describe how they believe their thoughts are morally equivalent to actions, Abramowitz said. Psychologists call this phenomenon ""thought-action fusion."" ""Scrupulosity literally means 'fearing sin where there is none,' "" Abramowitz and colleague Ryan Jacoby wrote in a recent article. How common is this condition? Scrupulosity is an understudied subcategory of OCD. Attempts at characterizing how many people might have this disorder, from the 1990s and early 2000s, suggested that somewhere between 5% and 33% of OCD patients have religious obsessions. Scientists are not sure what causes OCD, but they believe a combination of genetic and environmental factors may be at play. In societies where religiosity is more stringent, the numbers are higher: 50% of OCD patients in Saudi Arabia and 60% in Egypt said they had religious obsessions, according to studies from the early 1990s. A small number of people with scrupulosity are not religious at all, and a fear of moral transgression or inadvertently offending others weighs on their conscience, Abramowitz said. Psychologists do not believe that religion causes people to develop OCD. However, religion may influence whether someone with OCD experiences obsessions and compulsions related to religion, Abramowitz said. A tendency to get anxious and difficulties with uncertainty may factor into the condition, Abramowitz said. And, he pointed out, the vast majority of religious people do not have OCD. Many ""scrupulous"" people Abramowitz has met consider religion to be an important part of their lives, but they may avoid institutions such as churches, synagogues or mosques because it reminds them too much of their anxieties. ""They're walking around with this black cloud of 'I'm going to hell,' "" Abramowitz said. Such a cloud has been been present for centuries. The OCD History Website cites passages from the first century priest and essayist Plutarch and sixth century monk John Climacus that could be interpreted as descriptions of scrupulosity. St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, who died in 1556, appears to have suffered from the condition, said William Van Ornum, professor of psychology at Marist College. Ignatius wrote about his fears about stepping on something that looked like a cross. There have also been suggestions that Martin Luther experienced scrupulous obsessions, Van Ornum said. Robert Waters, a retired Lutheran minister, runs an online support network called The Scrupe Group. He said it has about 1,000 members, including Christians of several denominations, Jews, and at least one Hindu and one Muslim. Waters, who has suffered from scrupulosity personally, offers pastoral advice, but also tries to help people overcome their distrust of their own judgment. ""I think that's really a major part of it: To get to the point where people form their own consciences and don't rely on other people's,"" he said. Did I do it right? Scrupulosity often involves a lot of checking, Abramowitz said. Patients experience distress around the idea that they may have done something wrong or improper, so they may consult the Bible or religious authority figures often to see if they're doing things right. Consulting people and books isn't pathological, but in scrupulosity the behavior of checking is excessive compared to other religious people. Barbour often confessed bad thoughts to her parents or religious leaders. Feelings of guilt followed her for years. ""OCD makes you think in black and white,"" she said. ""There are no gray areas. Clean or not. Good or bad. There's nothing in between."" Barbour attended a religious school run by evangelical Christians. The altar calls, when the devout are asked to come forward and commit to Jesus Christ, heightened her anxieties about being good enough. She was also taught that if she had unforgiven sins, God could not hear her. Her obsessions took a toll on schoolwork, too. Texts were difficult to read without reviewing the same passage over and over, a problem people with other forms of OCD experience. Traig didn't have a complete Jewish education; she invented her own prayers to say three times a day, until a rabbi taught her the actual words. Rather than fearing sin, which has a distinct meaning in Christianity, Traig was worried she would be punished if she didn't practice her religion correctly. ""I couldn't have put my finger on what the punishment would be,"" she said. ""Just a sense of doom."" When the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986, killing the crew of seven, Traig felt partially responsible. Her OCD flared up around ages 12 to 13, and again from 16 to 17. With a Christian mother and a nonpracticing Jewish father, living in rural California, Traig didn't have many models of what Judaism could look like without constant anxiety about botching rituals. Learning how to doubt in a healthy way . The form of cognitive behavioral therapy used with scrupulous patients is called exposure therapy. This involves the patient confronting what he or she fears: Namely, uncertainty. Some people Abramowitz has worked with are anxious that they sometimes doubt their own belief in God. In therapy, they practice learning to live with the faith and uncertainty that normally surrounds religious beliefs. ""This is done by helping the patient to experience these types of uncertainties and learn that they, like any other religious person, can live with them comfortably,"" Abramowitz said. Triggers of obsessive thoughts, such as a religious symbol or scriptural passage or even going to church, would be part of therapy. ""Faith is about being comfortable with your beliefs even if you can't have a 100% guarantee about things like hell, whether there is really a God, or what it means to be faithful enough,"" Abramowitz said. ""You're taught to have faith, even though you cannot have scientific proof."" Keeping up religious traditions can be another source of anxiety. Ultra-religious Orthodox Jews, for instance, follow strict rules about separating milk from meat, and some consider this tenet so sacred that they have separate refrigerators for meat and dairy. Some people with scrupulosity develop anxieties around this rule, going as far as to avoid the milk refrigerator altogether while carrying meat. In exposure therapy, the patient might walk past the milk refrigerator while holding meat to confront her fear, Abramowitz said. That doesn't violate Jewish law, but confronts the fear of using the wrong refrigerator by mistake. Some patients may also receive Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, drugs that are also used to treat depression, according to the International OCD Foundation. Treatment sessions are usually once a week, between 12 and 20 times, or five days a week for three weeks, Abramowitz said. Members of the patient's faith community may be involved in the treatment, too. Religious but without OCD . Overcoming scrupulosity does not need to mean giving up religion. Waters left the Lutheran church at age 19 in part because of his OCD, but returned in his mid-20s, and was inspired to go to seminary at age 31. He came to realize that faith is partly about letting go of the idea that any individual can control all circumstances or prevent every tragedy. ""The process of coming back to the church was as much a part of the recovery as the therapy was,"" he said. Barbour got a diagnosis of OCD at age 26. She still slips into anxiety occasionally, but therapy has given her tools to fight back. Rather than trying to stop her obsessions, she imagines her thoughts flowing like a river, and takes deep breaths. She runs a blog called ""Bringing Along OCD."" Traig did talk therapy, but not specifically for OCD. She overcame her thought and behavior patterns in college, when she had to live with others her own age and feared being socially ostracized. She wrote a book discussing her experiences called ""Devil in the Details."" Today, she identifies with a blend of Conservative and Orthodox Judaism, and has a 3-year-old son and a 5-year-old daughter. Her daughter can't read prayer books, but she'll announce ""I have to go say my prayers!"" and invent a chant. Traig knows OCD has genetic links. She's also grateful that there's greater awareness and more treatment options for this condition than when she was a teen. If her daughter's prayer antics ever turn obsessive, she said, ""We're on that right away."" International OCD Foundation: Scrupulosity Fact Sheet .

"(CNN) -- Dogs and cats soothe the soul and provide companionship, but a report released this week suggests they sometimes cause broken bones and sprains, too. Most data on human-pet relationships have been devoted to the health benefits, such as lower blood pressure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that every year, more than 86,000 fall injuries are caused by pets. Dogs are the biggest culprits, causing 88 percent of the injuries.  Cats cause 11.7 percent of the falls, according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. CDC researchers formulated the national estimates based on data from 66 emergency rooms. ""Many of them occurred while people were walking their dog or chasing either their dog or cat,"" said Judy Stevens, an epidemiologist with the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. ""Over half the injuries with dogs were either falls or tripping over the pet or they were pushed or pulled by the pet."" Pets can suddenly rush to the door or scurry around the owners' feet, causing these accidents, experts said. At least once a week, a patient injured by an overexcited dog or an unexpected chew toy walks into the office of Dr. Leon S. Benson, an orthopedic surgeon and chief of hand surgery at the NorthShore University HealthSystem in Evanston, Illinois. These patients often have wrist fractures after falling on an outstretched hand. ""It's a common scenario,"" said Benson, who is also a spokesman for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. ""People trip over their pet or the pet, usually a dog, has a leash that pulls them down. While there's incredible incidence of falls in the elderly, people of all ages fall."" The CDC report did not determine whether individuals have died from pet-related falls, although Stevens said it was highly unlikely. Pet-related tumbles amount to about 1 percent of the total injuries caused by falls in the United States. Bonnie Beaver, professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine at Texas A&M University, said dogs and cats tend to walk near people's feet. ""They're small, most of them,"" she said. ""You walk along and they want to go one way all of a sudden. They're right in front of you or they want to rush to the door."" Psychologist and dog trainer Dr. William Doverspike said if people are tripping over dogs, they're ""the ones that need to get newspaper and hit themselves for not teaching the dog;"" he recommended taking every dog to obedience training. ""My opinion is that dogs are a lot happier and a lot more secure when they know what their handlers want,"" he said.  ""The relationship is stronger when the dog knows what he needs to get treats and has lot more freedom."" The CDC estimates about 9 percent of the falls are related to tripping over a toy or food bowl. ""It's not just the animals, but their toys,"" Beaver said. ""We have little balls and stuff all over the floor. Those are easy to trip over, especially at night. You need to have a dog basket to put the toys in or turn on the light before you go walking in the night."" Much of the research pertaining to people and their relationship with pets has been devoted to the health benefits, such as how animals help relieve stress and lower blood pressure. Not much data has been collected on pet-caused falls. Stevens, a fall expert, said she was frequently asked at medical conferences whether pets were fall hazards and so began examining that aspect of injury. In 2004, researchers at the University of Sydney in Australia reported on 16 patients between the ages of 75 and 88 who suffered major fractures in pet-related falls. Once again, dogs were the main culprit. But birds, a donkey and a goat made the list of animal suspects. The Australian researchers, in their report titled ""The perils of pet ownership"" found there were no deaths resulting from fall-related fractures, although one cat died when its owner fell and landed on it. In the U.S. cases, 90 percent of the pet-related falls were treated in emergency departments. About 9 percent of those injured were hospitalized. Most of those hospitalized were elderly. Older people's bones are more brittle and easier to break. This could increase the incidence of hip fracture, which requires an operation, Benson said. But it's not only the elderly who are affected. Several athletes have been dogged by the consequences of a human-canine collision. In September, an English soccer player, Liam Lawrence, was sidelined with an ankle injury after tripping over his Labrador on the stairs, according to British media reports. Dutch tennis star Kim Clijsters bruised her tailbone after falling over Diesel, her Great Dane, in 2006. Several Tour de France cyclists have crashed into dogs that trotted onto their path during the race. Sometimes the culprit is not the actual animal, but its byproduct. English soccer player Darren Barnard slipped on a puddle of urine from his puppy, Zak, and suffered a knee injury in 1999. Medical and veterinary experts had this advice for avoiding pet collisions: . • Put your animal in another room or different area of the house before carrying groceries or heavy things into the house. This will protect both the animal and human, so the dog or cat won't knock you off balance, and you will avoid stepping on an animal while distracted. • Keep stairs and hallways clear of clutter. • If you get up frequently in the dark, use night-lights so your path is lighted and you can see your pet. Also consider removing the animal from the bedroom to prevent stepping on it.","Every year, more than 86,000 fall injuries are caused by pets.

"(CNN) -- A freight train went off the rails outside Casselton, North Dakota, in the last week of December, spilling a load of crude oil and creating an impressive explosion that prompted officials to evacuate the small town. No one was hurt, but cell phone videos of the fireball were given wide exposure in the media. Here was ""an airborne toxic event,"" a phrase Don DeLillo famously used in his novel ""White Noise,"" a theatrical catastrophe born of the most quintessential American screw-up: a railroad crash. In addition to its use as shorthand for a failed government initiative or a friend who really ought to quit drinking, train wrecks occupy a contradictory place in the American cultural memory. They are as much celebrated as they are feared, and frequently memorialized in art and song. One of the most celebrated martyrs in American history, for example -- Casey Jones -- lost his life while trying to limit casualties in a 1900 smash-up on the Illinois Central. But beneath the morbid romanticism lies a historical home truth about train wrecks -- it took a little while before the most spectacular and shocking of them resulted in enough popular outrage to spur by real legislative action to make the rails safer. And so today an incident such as Casselton draws attention, with the help of dramatic TV images, to the enormous amount of oil being shipped on American rails and the inadequacy of current tank-car designs. It was different before mass media, and not every crash was galvanizing. Wrecks were all too common on early American rails, mainly because the tracks were constructed so badly. The merchant barons of Baltimore and Philadelphia were in a rush to get their lines over the Appalachians and into the fertile grain country of the Middle West during the 1830s. Crews grew accustomed to laying warped wooden ties and low-quality iron, and breakneck curves were common in the mountains. Signaling was also primitive, which meant that collisions -- euphemistically called ""cornfield meets"" -- were another cost of doing business. Perhaps because they involved an exciting new technology -- the railroad was the first true ""machine"" of the steam era to see widespread use -- or perhaps because the crashes were so messy and difficult to clean up (a combination of jacks, ramps and pulleys were often necessary to rerail cars), train wrecks came to assume a mythic stature and even a nobility that a later generation of car and plane mishaps would never touch. When engineer Casey Jones hit the brakes on his speeding Illinois Central locomotive instead of jumping in 1900, he died in the crash but became the subject of an enormously popular ballad and an oral legend that he died with the throttle puncturing his heart and a halo of spilled corn around his head. Songs such as ""The Wreck of the Old 97"" and ""Wreck of the Royal Palm"" became beloved standards. There were no stirring ballads to be drawn out of a horrendous train caught fire in Angola, New York, in 1867 that burned 49 people to death. The result was that carriages would no longer be made of wood and track gauges were standardized throughout the country, a turning point for cars and rails. And in New York City's Park Avenue was torn up and Grand Central Depot was completely rebuilt after a wreck in the tunnels killed 15 people in 1902. The Long Island Rail Road installed automatic speed control on its system after a crash near Richmond Hill, in Queens, in 1950 killed 78 commuters and triggered the threat of a boycott by frightened Long Island riders. And Southern California's Metrolink began an accelerated program to install a GPS-based safety system called positive train control after a 2008 wreck in which the driver blew through a stop signal because he was texting on his phone. Likewise, the deadly crash of a Metro North train north of New York City in December has raised the urgency of a 2015 federal deadline for railroads to install positive train control. Wrecks have so fascinated and horrified the public since the early days of train travel that perhaps it is no surprise that America's first corporate public relations department was created by the Pennsylvania Railroad after one of its trains plunged into a creek near Atlantic City in 1906, killing 53 passengers. Last week's derailment in North Dakota has already raised questions about just how much oil is now being shipped by rail in America. The answer: a lot. Almost all of North Dakota's considerable production of oil is shipped by rail, and train cars carrying petroleum went from about 10,000 in 2009 to an estimated 400,000 by the end of this year. This signals a revival of a hauling practice not widely used since the 1860s, and has spurred calls to toughen federal design standards for the DOT-111 type of tank car that is most often used to transport oil. Unlike other transforming rail crashes in American history, nobody died or was even hurt in the Casselton incident. It would be a major step forward -- perhaps even worthy of myth -- if this bloodless wreck on the prairie is what it took to bring us better oil cars on American tracks.

"(CNN) -- His name is Abdullah X. His slogan: ""Mind of a Scholar, Heart of a Warrior."" But the star of this new animated show isn't a caped crusader battling bad guys in the streets of Gotham -- he's fighting for the hearts and minds of young Muslims everywhere. ""Abdullah X,"" the new Web-only cartoon series, is the tale of a young Muslim man in London who is struggling with his identity and his faith. It is a story that its creator, a former extremist who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity, knows all too well. ""I was struggling with my own identity and sense of belonging when I was growing up -- issues around self-esteem and confidence, and where you fit in with regards to your Britishness or your Muslimness,"" Ahmed, as he asked to be called for this story, told CNN. Ahmed said he spent years helping to spread and vocalize ""extreme and harsh"" worldviews in Britain. He saw efforts by governments and organizations to understand what was fueling anti-Western extremism as often ""piecemeal and simplistic."" ""Young people -- the most vulnerable groups in society -- were caught between government policy perspectives on how you combat terrorism and extremism, and this wall of shame and denial from within communities. I felt that we needed something that was going to be innovative and engaging."" So he created Abdullah X, the eponymous star of the series and an animated alter-ego that mirrors Ahmed's own journey from former extremist to someone who now hopes to steer young Muslims away from violence and extreme views. Inspired by the superhero comics of his childhood, Ahmed used his own money to create ""Abdullah X"" and post it online, specifically to grab the attention of a generation raised on computer games and social media. The series, which includes episodes such as ""Five Considerations for a Muslim on Syria"" and ""Don't Try and Justify your Anger with Islam,"" is intended to be a counterpoint to the flashy, gore-filled videos posted on YouTube by groups like ISIS -- the Islamist militant group that has seized large chunks of Syria and Iraq and rallied hundreds of Western recruits to its cause. In a ""soundbite age,"" as he describes it, Ahmed says his goal was to create a robust narrative in order to give viewers pause to reflect -- and to prevent vulnerable minds from succumbing to ISIS' radical ideology. ""There's no point sermonizing, there's no point creating three-hour videos and campaigns [where] young people can see [a] potential propaganda element of it. If we're going to tackle extremism effectively, or tackle the narrative, you have to understand that narrative very well and then package that in a way that rivals the extremist material that a lot of young people find online,"" Ahmed said. ""Abdullah X is potentially any particular young Muslim from any particular walk of life, in any given time,"" Ahmed said. ""His story and the development of his character suggest that he's built resilience and an element of willpower, and housed that within a kind of critical framework where he's able to judge sources on their merit rather than just believe what is put in front of him."" Ahmed's videos, which he posts on YouTube and Facebook, have already had tens of thousands of views -- and there are plans for an app that lets users directly interact with ""Abdullah X."" ""We're trying to tackle the keyboard warrior mentality. We're trying to tackle the 'Call of Duty,' PlayStation mentality and the 'jihobbyist' mentality -- those people who are allowing their grievances to sometimes put them at risk or in harm without knowing it."" Ahmed says he'll have achieved the project's objective ""if we can save one person from going to die in some foreign land, or attempting to do something in his homeland or her homeland."" In the meantime, Ahmed hopes that ""Abdullah X"" will keep winning young Muslim viewers over, one YouTube click at a time. CNN's Nick Thompson contributed to this report.","New animated series ""Abdullah X"" aims to steer young Muslim minds away from extremism .

"(CNN) -- If you asked me -- and God knows nobody has -- I would have to guess that never in the history of humankind has anyone ever actually slipped on a banana peel. Believe me. I've tried. When things get slow in my house we experiment with fruit. (To which he immediately realized the suggestiveness of that last sentence.) Now, while I maintain my strong conviction that nobody has ever slipped on a banana peel, Japanese researchers have proven that these things can, in fact, decrease the friction under a shoe sole by one-fifth. Which means ... it's possible. And I applaud this research, for it is delightfully pointless. At least until slipping on banana peels becomes a real thing and turns into an epidemic. ""News flash! This just in from Los Angeles, where 600 more people have slipped on banana peels. One eyewitness on the scene described it as, quote: Hilarious."" But this was real research. Done by real scientists. Who received real awards for their banana study. Real awards! You see, every year in September there is a gala held at Harvard where great minds come together to celebrate the Ig Nobel Prizes. Which are just like the Nobel Prizes, but with an ""I"" and a ""g"" in front, thus suggesting nobody here has managed to cure cancer. At the Ig Nobels (Think Ignobles, but pronounce it Ig-NOH-bells), instead of celebrating life-changing achievements, they honor those who ""first make people laugh, and then make them think."" Really, it sounds like the kind of event I could attend without pants. At first, people would laugh. And then they would think. ""Ha! Ha! Ha! Wait. Why is this man covered with rainbow sprinkles?"" The overall goal of the Ig Nobels is to encourage interest in science, medicine and technology by highlighting the absurd and the unusual. Like banana peel studies. Because they're light and fun. And, in the end, you might actually learn something. As opposed to what you are reading now, which, while light and (quite debatably) fun, will ultimately leave you with nothing more than a permanently burned image in your brain of my naked body covered in rainbow sprinkles. You're welcome. Anyway, that's the concept behind the Ig Nobels. And their 24th annual celebration was just held on Thursday. The theme was: Food. So, in addition to Team Banana from Japan, which won the physics prize, other awards were given out to such important studies as how cured pork can stop a nose bleed, and what happens in the brain when people somehow see the face of Jesus in a piece of toast. The latter was the winning study of the neuroscience prize. I didn't read the actual research, but I'm pretty sure seeing Jesus in your toast suggests that your brain wiring suddenly made the connection that you have an eBay account and -- hark! -- you also love being on the local news. That's when you see it. But my favorite award was the prize for public health. This year, that went to a study investigating whether or not owning a cat is mentally hazardous for humans. It is. The cat study was a slight variation from the food theme (I hope) but good science nonetheless. I mean, it was that or banana peels. Or Jesus toast. Or pork in the nose. Heck, come to think of it, maybe I should've been a scientist. After all, I like experimenting with meat. (To which he immediately realized the suggestiveness of that last sentence.)

"San Diego (CNN) -- You've probably read those articles about how, in the United States, minorities are becoming the majority. That's a polite way of describing what is really going on. Namely, that the U.S. population is becoming more Latino and less white. More than any other group, it is Latinos who are driving demographic changes. Last week, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that, of all the babies born in the United States in 2011, more than half were members of minority groups. Latinos, Asians, African-Americans and other minorities accounted for 50.4% of births last year, marking the first time in U.S. history this has happened. Immigration is a driving force. So is the fact that Latinos have higher birthrates because they tend to be younger and starting families. According to the report, Latinos have a median age of 27; with whites, it's 42. When I read these kinds of stories, I wince. Some people assume that making lawmakers, media and corporations aware of population trends will persuade them to see the value in diversity and cause them to reach out to nonwhite populations. In my experience, it doesn't have that effect at all. People tend to do what they want to do the way they've always done it. But what you can set your watch by is the backlash to these stories. It's rooted in fear, but also in human nature. No one likes being told they're being displaced or pushed aside, or that they're not going to be as relevant as time goes on. So when David Bostis, a senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, tells CNN.com as he did recently: ""The Republicans' problem is that their voters are white, aging and dying off"" and that ""there will come a time when (Republicans) suffer catastrophic losses with the realization of the population changes,"" it is bound to set off shock waves. And it did. Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh saw the CNN story as a threat, and he went ballistic. ""It is clear that this, and other similar stories like this, are meant to serve as a warning to Republicans and conservatives,"" Limbaugh told his audience of millions. ""And the warning is: You are on the wrong side of history. And you are on the wrong side of demographics. You better do what the coming majority wants right now, or you're gonna suffer the consequences. There is an implied threat in this story. You're getting older. You're white and you're dying off. Pretty soon you're gonna find out what it's been like to not be you."" ""That's the implication of the story,"" Limbaugh insisted. ""You've been the majority for all these decades, all these generations, but your time is coming when you're gonna be the minorities and there's gonna be people with majority power over you. So you better learn right. You better change your ways. You better get with the program so that everybody likes you."" As is often the case when Limbaugh charges into matters of race and ethnicity, he has it all wrong. These aren't threats. These are facts. And they're presented not to pressure people to do ""what the coming majority wants right now"" as much as to highlight the value of doing the right thing by making our institutions more inclusive. Stories like this are supposed to enlighten us and give us a heads up about what's coming around the corner, so we can take advantage of the trend and not be overrun by it. Elected officials, media companies and the business communities can put off thinking about the future, but they can't escape it. Meanwhile, what people like Limbaugh seem to be trying to escape is a reckoning for what happened in the past. As he sees it, all this talk about changing demographics is tied to a larger criticism of the United States as having at times fallen short of its own principles of liberty, fairness and equality. ""Part of it is payback because this evil white majority has arranged things so they get all the spoils,"" he said. ""And then whatever they don't want is what gets handed down. Those days are about over, and the big change is coming."" What needs to change is this kind of thinking. It's total nonsense. In nearly 25 years of writing about politics, race and ethnicity, I've never heard any member of a minority group talk about how they're looking forward to ""payback"" once they're in the majority. Not one. What I do hear quite a bit is that people of color believe in the greatness of this country, and they want to help write the next chapter in ways that benefit them and their families. They want a seat at the table, not because they feel entitled but because they feel they have something unique and valuable to offer. And they don't want to get even; they just want to get ahead. What's wrong with that? Nothing. In fact, it's in keeping with some of this country's greatest traditions. Have no fear. The face of America is changing. But it's heart and soul never will. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","U.S. Census says that more than half the babies born in 2011 were minorities .

"(Kaiser Health News) -- Devin Payne had gone years without health insurance -- having little need and not much money to pay for it. Then Payne, who had a wife and four children, realized she could no longer live as a man. In her early 40s, she changed her name, began wearing long skirts and grew out her sandy blond hair. And she started taking female hormones, which caused her breasts to develop and the muscle mass on her 6-foot one-inch frame to shrink. The next step was gender reassignment surgery. For that, Payne, who is now 44, said she needed health coverage. ""It is not a simple, easy, magical surgery,"" said Payne, a photographer who lives in Palm Springs. ""Trying to do this without insurance is a big risk. Things can go wrong ... not having the money to pay for it would be awful."" Payne learned in the fall that she might qualify for subsidies through the state's new insurance marketplace, Covered California, because her income fell under the limit of $46,000 a year. She eagerly signed up in March for a Blue Shield plan for about $230 a month, and began making preparations for the surgery that would change her life. A 'pre-existing condition' Among the less-talked-about implications of the Affordable Care Act is the relief it is providing to many transgender people, many of whom are low-income and who have struggled to obtain health coverage. Getting jobs that offer insurance often has been difficult for transgender people and the cost of purchasing plans on the private market can be prohibitive. Some have been denied policies altogether after being diagnosed with ""gender identity disorder,"" often considered a pre-existing condition. Without insurance, many people were unable to afford the hormones, surgeries and counseling needed to complete their transition. Nor would they have been covered in the event of surgical complications, which can include infections. ""We are still dependent on insurance and the medical community for us to be able to live authentically,"" said Aydin Kennedy, coordinator of the transgender health program at St. John's Well Child and Family Center in Los Angeles. Now, federal law prohibits health insurance companies from discriminating against transgender people, and it bars insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. That makes it possible for more transgender people to purchase private plans. And in states that expanded their Medicaid programs, those with low incomes may get free coverage. The federal anti-discrimination regulations have yet to be written, but California insurance regulators have said that companies must treat transgender patients the same as other patients. For example, if plans cover hormones for post-menopausal women, they must also cover them for transgender women. Medicare, the program for the elderly and disabled, lifted its ban on covering sex reassignment surgery earlier this year. ""The law and policy are on a transgender person's side for the first time,"" said Anand Kalra, program administrator at the Oakland-based Transgender Law Center. Conservative and religious groups oppose using government funds for transgender surgeries, questioning whether they are medically necessary, ethical or effective. ""We would oppose sex change operations all together,"" said Peter Sprigg, senior fellow at the Family Research Council in Washington. ""But as a public policy issue, we would feel particularly strongly that taxpayers shouldn't be asked to pay for it."" A few obstacles remain for transgender patients. Not many doctors specialize in transgender care. And while the law opens the door to insurance coverage, insurers can set conditions and don't automatically approve payment. ""Insurance companies are making up their own rules as they go along,"" said Kalra of the Transgender Law Center. 'Feeling complete' Growing up in Kansas, Payne remembers trying on her mother's clothes and dressing as a girl every year for Halloween. She dreamt of having another life after this one, as a girl. But Payne said she mostly suppressed her feelings and tried to live up to the expectations for a male. ""I put it out of my head,"" she said. She married a woman she met at work and they had four children, now ages 7 to 22. But she never felt comfortable in the traditional role of father and provider. ""I was just horrible at it because it wasn't who I was,"" she said. So Payne became the primary caretaker, playing the ""mommy role"" as she worked from home doing software development for pharmaceutical companies. She felt increasingly anxious, and in late 2012, a therapist helped her to realize that she was meant to live as a woman. Payne said her entire outlook on life changed when she started taking female hormones. ""All my anxiety and all of the bad things that I felt inside were just completely washed away,"" she said. Payne told her wife, who was upset. She told Payne: I married a man, not a woman -- but she also admitted that she wasn't entirely surprised. With mixed feelings, Payne's wife stayed in the marriage, and the family moved from Kansas to California, in part so Payne could be more comfortable living as a transgender woman. They rented a small house in a middle class neighborhood on the outskirts of Palm Springs and sent their children to the public school. Late last year, Payne's wife, who had battled alcoholism for years, died of liver disease. Payne said the children worried how people would react to her transition, but she said they soon realized it wasn't as big of a deal as they had feared. When Payne brought birthday cupcakes to her 7-year-old daughter's classroom last year, the children asked if she was a girl or a boy. After Payne told them she was a girl, ""they just wanted their cupcakes."" In California, Payne found transgender friends and became an advocate within the community. ""You find out that there is a whole world of people out there,"" said Payne, who wears little makeup or jewelry and calls herself a ""T-shirt and skirt kind of a girl."" Payne was ready for the surgery. She started calling the approved providers in Blue Shield's preferred provider network. But they were booked up for months, or years. She felt she couldn't wait -- she wanted to do the surgery while her children were on summer vacation so they could go to her parents' house in Kansas as she recovered. She found an out-of-network doctor in Palo Alto who would do the surgery about a month later. ""The time was right and I wanted to get it done,"" she said. Her Blue Shield policy said that gender reassignment surgery -- which uses existing tissue to construct female genitalia -- could be covered if patients met certain guidelines. For example, she had to be diagnosed with gender identity disorder and have an ""expressed desire"" to live as a member of the opposite sex. By the scheduled date, Blue Shield had authorized the operation but hadn't determined exactly how much it would pay for an out-of-network provider. Payne got a cashier's check for nearly all her savings, $27,000, to pay the doctor, hoping her insurance plan would reimburse most of it. She worried about all the other expenses too, including the hospital stay, lab work and anesthesiology services. The day of the surgery at Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City, Payne said she remembers being wheeled in to the operating room and feeling very calm. When she woke up, with oxygen still attached and wearing her hospital gown, a friend told her that the surgery had gone well, without any immediate complications. Later that day, she had just enough energy to type a few words on her Facebook profile: ""Feeling complete."" Grateful for coverage . On a boiling afternoon in early July, about six weeks after the operation, Payne and her friends sat outside on the patio next to a pool. Misters sprayed above them, and Payne's cat and two dogs wandered beneath their feet. Payne said she did suffer a few complications later -- some swelling and an infection -- but she recovered with medication and support from friends. She is still trying to figure out how much she has to pay out-of-pocket for the surgery and hospital stay -- and how much of that her insurance plan will reimburse. Payne said she believes the lab work, pathology, anesthesiology services and follow-up doctor's visits were all covered. But recently she got a statement saying she was on the hook for $17,000 of the total cost of the surgery. Payne believes that the government and insurance companies should help cover such operations. The population of transgender patients who want surgery is small, and she said they are less likely to suffer mental health problems once they have it. Payne said she will be grateful for whatever coverage she can receive.

"London (CNN) -- A bank trader accused of fraud in connection with a $2.3 billion loss in unauthorized trading reported by Swiss giant UBS is ""sorry beyond words,"" his lawyer said Thursday. Kwaku Adoboli was remanded in custody until October 20 by the City of London Magistrates' Court. In a statement to the court, lawyer Patrick Gibbs said his client was ""sorry beyond words for what happened here."" His client ""went to UBS himself,"" the lawyer said. Adoboli faces a charge of fraud by abuse of position between January and September 2011, causing losses in excess of $1.5 billion, and two counts of false accounting. A new charge of fraud by abuse of position from October 2008 to October 2010 was also added Thursday. Adoboli's legal team has not applied for bail and he has not yet entered a plea on the charges. The 31-year-old was first charged Friday, a day after he was arrested in connection with the discovery of unauthorized deals at UBS. The Financial Services Authority, the Serious Fraud Office and the Crown Prosecution Service are also involved in investigating the case. UBS said no client positions were affected by its $2.3 billion loss. But the ""unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank"" could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, it said. The loss would potentially be among the largest ever to a bank in unauthorized trading.

"(CNN) -- Handicapping the Nobel Peace Prize is notoriously difficult. Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), a peace studies organization, has never picked a winner, since starting to make predictions in 2009. This year, the odds-on favorite was Pope Francis. His win would have been historic -- he'd have been the first Roman Catholic pontiff to win the peace prize. Instead, it went to India's Kailash Satyarthi and Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai for their push for young people's right to education. But, by losing, the Pope joins another -- still illustrious -- list: Favorites that didn't win. Here's a look at six rumored front-runners, who surprised everyone when they didn't walk away with the Nobel Peace Prize: . Mahatma Gandhi . Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi is widely recognized as one of the most-snubbed nominees. His name is virtually synonymous with peace. Gandhi was nominated five times for the Nobel Peace Prize -- in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1947 and finally in 1948, a few days before he was assassinated -- but never won. A posthumous award was reportedly considered. But, in the end, the Nobel Committee decided against making an award in 1948, saying ""there was no suitable living candidate."" Many have interpreted that comment to mean that Gandhi was the de facto winner that year. Sima Samar . The Nobel Committee is known to make surprising choices sometimes, and few winners were more of a surprise than U.S. President Barack Obama in 2009, the first year of his presidency. Many had expected Samar to win that year, or later. She is best known as a trailblazer for women's rights in Afghanistan, though she's worked on human rights around the world. Samar fled Afghanistan when its communist regime arrested her husband in 1984. She remained in exile until 2002 when she was appointed as a women's affairs minister in then-Afghan President Hamid Karzai's transitional administration . She is a medical doctor who serves as the chairperson of Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission. Cesar Chavez . Chavez was nominated for the prize three times by the American Friends Service Committee -- in 1971, 1974 and 1975. The Mexican American farm worker and labor leader co-founded what's now known as the United Farm Workers. The group fought for fair wages and safer working conditions through nonviolent marches, boycotts and fasts. Chavez is widely celebrated in the United States as one of the country's foremost Latino leaders. He died in the early 1990s, but his legacy lives on. Chavez is credited with popularizing the Spanish phrase, ""Si, se puede,"" which was adopted as ""Yes, we can,"" by Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. Pope John Paul II . This year wasn't the first year a Pope was in the running. John Paul was a favorite in 2003. Many credit the Polish-born pope with playing a key role in the defeat of Communism. He traveled widely and made a point to preach religious tolerance during his 26-year papacy. When he died, in 2005, Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel told CNN that John Paul II ""will have a very important place in Jewish history"" as the first Pope to visit a synagogue. He apologized for previous persecution of Jews at the hands of the church and for the Vatican's failure to do more to prevent the Holocaust. John Paul lost to Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian human rights lawyer who became the first Muslim woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Corazon Aquino . Aquino was the first woman to lead the Philippines, serving as President from 1986-1992. A former housewife, she was propelled to the head of a ""People Power"" movement that pushed out longtime strongman Ferdinand Marcos after her husband's assassination. She was a religious woman who drove the country's democratic process. Aquino fought against poverty and the country's massive debt, while contending with a Marxist insurgency and several coup attempts. She managed to reform the country's constitution, imposing a single six-year term for Philippine presidents. She died in 2009, without ever having won the peace prize. Her son, Benigno Aquino III, is the current President of the Philippines. Eleanor Roosevelt . Was one Roosevelt enough? In 1906, Theodore Roosevelt became the first American to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Decades later, Eleanor Roosevelt never did. She is thought to have been nominated several times while she was alive. There was also a campaign to award a posthumous prize to her. Roosevelt was a tireless advocate for civil rights and women. She transformed the role of the first lady of the United States. ""She advocated for human and civil rights throughout her political life and represented America in the United Nations and helped to draft the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights,"" wrote a CNN iReporter in support of a posthumous prize for Roosevelt. ""She was a strong, bold and courageous woman and she deserves to honored respectfully."" CNN's Faith Karimi contributed to this report.","NEW: India's Kailash Satyarthi and Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai win the peace prize .

"(CNN) -- As Catholic bishops in Rome began a major meeting on modern family life two weeks ago, Pope Francis encouraged them to speak candidly and ""without timidness."" He certainly got what he asked for. Bishops bickered. Conservatives contemplated conspiracy theories. Liberals lamented their colleagues' rigidity. Through it all, the Pope stayed silent. Even when a report emerged from the bishops' meeting that welcomed gays and lesbians in strikingly open terms, Francis didn't say a word. Even when that welcome was watered down, not once, but twice, and then, on Saturday, largely scrapped, the Pope revealed nothing. By the midpoint of the meeting -- officially called the Synod of the Bishops on Pastoral Challenges to the Family -- conservatives were complaining that Francis had ""done a lot of harm"" by not making his own views known. But if Francis had spoken, it would have shut down the very debate he wanted to spark, Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, a close ally of the Pope's, told reporters. ""Roma locuta, causa finita,"" Ravasi said. That's Latin for, ""Rome has spoken, the case is closed."" (The Pope is the bishop of Rome.) Finally, as the meeting closed on Saturday afternoon, the Pope addressed the nearly 200 bishops he had summoned to Rome. In a widely praised speech, he told them the church must find a middle path between showing mercy toward people on the margins and holding tight to church teachings. What's more, he said, church leaders still have a year to find ""concrete solutions"" to the problems plaguing modern families -- from war and poverty to hostility toward nontraditional unions. A follow-up meeting is scheduled for next October in Rome. All of this may raise a few questions in people's minds. If the Pope is the head of the church, why can't he just make changes on his own? Why are so many Catholics resistant to revising church teaching? And what does all of this have to do with Jesus? Here are some things to keep in mind. WWJD? Jesus didn't often talk about practical matters, scholars say, but he did talk about divorce. ""I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery,"" Jesus says in the Gospel of Matthew. That statement may sound reactionary today, said Candida Moss, a scholar of New Testament and early Christianity, but it was actually pretty progressive at the time. ""In a world in which women had to be married to be successful,"" she said, ""being this stringent about divorce actually helped those women."" It especially helped women callously discarded by their husbands, which was allowed under Mosaic law, Moss added. So, when Catholic bishops debate whether to allow divorced and remarried Catholics to receive Communion -- as they did in Rome over the past two weeks -- many bring up this teaching from Jesus. If Jesus said it, the logic goes, the church can't change it. Tradition . The Catholic Church traces its roots to Peter, whom Jesus gave the keys to heaven and who is considered by many to be the first bishop of Rome -- a sort of proto-pope, if you will. Between then and now, a span of more than 2,000 years, the church has accrued layers upon layers of teachings and traditions. Catholics call this the ""deposit of the faith,"" and many conservatives say the job of modern church leaders is to guard it, not change it. In fact, as truth -- with a capital T -- some conservatives argue that even the Pope can never change it. ""The Pope, more than anyone else as the pastor of the universal church, is bound to serve the truth,"" Cardinal Raymond Burke, a leading conservative, told Buzzfeed recently. ""The Pope is not free to change the church's teachings with regard to the immorality of homosexual acts or the insolubility of marriage or any other doctrine of the faith."" Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, another prominent church leader, suggested that doctrine could change, but only if the Pope called an ecumenical council. More liberal church leaders argue that core Catholic teachings can evolve over time, as they did, for example, on slavery. ""Doctrine develops,"" German Cardinal Reinhard Marx said last week. ""Saying that doctrine will never change is a restrictive view of things."" In the war of words between conservative and liberal Catholics, the biggest battle is here: what can and cannot change about the church's moral tenets. The church universal . The Catholic Church has an estimated 1.2 billion members spread across hundreds of countries from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. In many of those countries, ethics, particularly sexual ethics, differ widely. For instance, in Africa, 75% of Catholics believe that divorced and remarried Catholics are ""living in sin"" and should not receive Holy Communion. In the United States and Latin America, just 30% agree. On same-sex marriage, the gulf is just as wide. Africa (99%) and the Philippines (84%) reject same-sex marriage, while a slim majority of Catholics in the United States support it. The Pope, as head of the whole Catholic Church, has to consider all of his far-flung flock -- not just cater to a particular segment, said the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and author of the book ""Jesus: A Pilgrimage."" ""While he is interested in being prophetic and moving things forward, you can't move so fast that you lose an entire wing or geographic section of the church."" The old guard . For nearly 35 years, the Catholic Church was led by two popes -- Saint John Paul II and Benedict XVI -- who held fast to traditional church teachings, and part of their mission was to appoint hundreds of bishops who share that view. As a result, conservative bishops hold top positions in many dioceses across the world and in the Vatican itself. ""These are people who have spent a lot of time accruing power and supporters, and they feel very strongly"" about the church not changing, Moss said. Since his election in 2013, though, Francis has slowly but surely reversed that trend. The Pope has appointed moderates in several big dioceses, including in Chicago earlier this fall, and he's removed some archconservatives from their posts. Burke, for example, who is something of a hero to traditionalists, confirmed last week that he's been ousted from the Vatican's supreme court. So, while many liberals expressed disappointment that the bishops' surprising welcome to gays was later retracted, others argue that at least the topic is still on the table for the next year's meeting, when the church will make final decisions on these issues. Put another way, taking ""three steps forward, two back, is still going forward,"" said Marx.","Bishops bickered throughout a major meeting on Catholic doctrine .
Pope Francis kept largely silent throughout the debate .
Catholic teaching is not easy to change ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Gov. Chris Christie, who has long avoided wading into the immigration debate, said Thursday in Mexico City that he won't lay out his position on immigration reform unless he decides to run for president. ""Until that time I have no role in the immigration debate, except for how it may affect the individual citizens of New Jersey, which I'll deal with as governor,"" the New Jersey Republican told reporters. ""But I won't have anything to say on immigration unless and until I become a candidate for president of the United States,"" he continued. ""If that happens, then I will articulate a full position on it."" Third of Mexicans would migrate to the U.S., survey finds . His comments came on the second of a three-day trip to Mexico, where the governor is meeting with Mexican dignitaries and business leaders to build economic and education partnerships. While Christie has repeatedly criticized President Obama for his handling of security enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border, the governor has yet to detail his own position on legislation reform. ""I know you guys are begging to have me focus on immigration, and let me put you to rest: I'm not going to,"" he said, referring to the news media. ""You can ask in 18 different ways ... I'm not giving you the story, so you can move on to whatever your next questions are."" Republican ignoring their own advice on immigration . During a trip to Iowa in July -- at the height of the crisis involving children crossing the border illegally -- Christie declined to answer questions from reporters about immigration. ""I'm not going to discuss a complicated issue like immigration in a parking lot here in Marion, which really deserves a much deeper and more thoughtful conversation than we give out here right now,"" he said at the time, faulting ""both parties"" for the way they've handled the issue. Christie: N.J. may consider housing kids from southern border influx . In June, while the governor was in San Francisco, he refused to lay out his position, again saying his current location was not the appropriate venue for such a topic. ""I'm sure you'd love me to do that,"" he said with sarcasm, after a reporter asked him to spell out his stance. ""And in fact what I want to do in a flower warehouse, I want to give you a very complex answer behind a set of microphones on a contentious issue that's driving debate all across the country. No thank you."" On Thursday, Christie said he discussed immigration issues the day prior in a meeting with Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, saying they talked about how ""it's a very difficult issue for both parties"" in the United States and how it's Washington's responsibility to fix the problem. Since the 2012 presidential election, in which the GOP presidential nominee won only 27% of the Latino vote, Republicans have been more aggressive in courting Latino voters. Christie himself has frequently pointed out that he won 51% of the Latino vote in New Jersey during his re-election bid. Asked by one reporter about the importance of Latino voters for Republicans at the national level, Christie acknowledged the electoral advantages. ""The importance of it is the more votes you get, the more chance you have to win,"" he said bluntly. ""And I don't care who those votes come from, as long as you wind up with more than the other guy, you win, you get to govern, and that's what our party should be focused on.""","Speaking in Mexico City, Christie says: nothing on immigration, for now .

"(CNN) -- Americans have followed with alarm the unfolding calamity of Central American children seeking refuge at our border. But many of us may not realize there's a crisis-within-a-crisis: An overwhelming number of these young, unaccompanied immigrants are facing deportation hearings without access to legal help. The lack of legal assistance threatens not only the children themselves, but also our nation's commitment to basic fairness. Since October, more than 63,000 children have crossed the border into the United States, most from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Reports say many are fleeing violence, human trafficking and poverty, and detail harrowing tales of children terrified to return to their home countries fearing gang violence and retribution. While these children look for solace and safety in the United States, the troubling reality is that more than 40% of them will be processed and face deportation without legal counsel. It's mind-boggling that children are coming before judges alone while the federal government is represented by trained attorneys, as the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project legal director Matt Adams recently pointed out. These children, many of whom don't speak English, simply can't get a fair hearing without legal representation. Fortunately, civil legal aid programs are working closely with private pro bono lawyers to ensure that more children will have legal representation and understand their rights. But more resources are needed to ensure that thousands of children do not face these complicated, high-stakes legal proceedings alone. But the civil legal aid community has come forward to help the unaccompanied children who lack legal counsel and adequate resources. In Texas, State Supreme Court Chief Justice Nathan Hecht issued an urgent call for private attorneys to mobilize a civil legal aid response to the crisis, and lawyers across the state are stepping up and volunteering alongside nonprofit organizations to ensure justice for these children in state court hearings. In San Antonio, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services has assisted thousands of young kids by representing them during immigration proceedings, providing ""know your rights"" presentations, and holding screenings to identify those who may be eligible for permanent status. After screening more than 3,000 children from Central America, the center found that as many as half had viable claims for visas. But most children don't understand their rights to file visa applications. As the Texas executive director of Refugee and Immigrant Center, Jonathan Ryan, told USA Today: ""What really determines the outcome of these cases is whether these children have access to competent, affordable civil legal aid, not their actual eligibility."" This work isn't happening only at the Southwest border. Northwest Immigrant Rights Project and Public Counsel in Los Angeles has joined pro bono attorneys at K&L Gates to file a federal lawsuit that seeks to guarantee the right to counsel for unaccompanied minors' civil legal aid programs. Now, as the Obama administration accelerates deportation hearings, many unaccompanied children may be processed and deported in a matter of monthsâ€”giving civil legal aid groups less time to help them find counsel, understand their options, and identify grounds for asylum. In response to these accelerated procedures, the Legal Aid Justice Center in Virginia is leading efforts to ensure that expedited proceedings don't hamper children's access to counsel. Many people might think these problems are new, but civil legal aid lawyers have been helping unaccompanied minors caught up in the immigration system for a long time. At Greater Boston Legal Services, attorneys have been working with pro bono lawyers and social service agencies as the number of children facing removal proceedings on their own increases steadily over the years. While we await the bipartisan agreement and action we need for comprehensive immigration reform, civil legal aid lawyers and volunteers will continue to protect the fundamental due process rights of many young children. But without additional resources, too many children will not get the help they so desperately need. It's simply not right that tens of thousands of unaccompanied children are facing deportation hearings all alone. In America's legal system, everyone deserves legal assistance to ensure fairness. Our nation's commitment, after all, is to justice for all, not just for those who can afford it.","Martha Bergmark: 40% of unaccompanied kids don't have lawyers for deportation hearings .

She says: Most are fleeing terrible violence yet don't speak English and don't know rights .

"(CNN) -- The so-called richest game in football hinged on a late defensive error by Derby captain Richard Keogh as Bobby Zamora scored a dramatic injury-time winner for 10-man Queens Park Rangers in the Championship playoff at Wembley Saturday. Promotion to the English Premier League is estimated to be worth $200m and it was QPR celebrating an unlikely win at the final whistle. Former England international Zamora scored with a first-time volleyed shot after Keogh's intended clearance fell straight to his feet. It was QPR's first shot on target after a match largely dominated by Derby -- particularly after Gary O'Neil's red card on the hour mark. O'Neil went for hacking down Johnny Russell as he raced towards goal and it looked only a matter of time before Derby, managed by former England boss Steve McClaren, grabbed a winner. His QPR counterpart Harry Redknapp admitted as much as he reflected on his side's triumph. ""We were hanging on with 10 men until a fantastic finish,"" he told Sky Sports. ""We were hanging on for our lives,"" he admitted. QPR, relegated from the EPL last season, has spent heavily, backed by owner Tony Fernandes, with a massive wage bill in comparison to other rivals in the second flight of English football. Leicester City and Burnley gained the two automatic promotion spots, leaving QPR to negotiate its passage through the playoffs involving the next four best-placed teams in the league. Victory over Wigan saw QPR into the final, while Derby thrashed Brighton to reach the Wembley showdown. A cagey and tactical match produced few chances, the best coming after O'Neil was dismissed but QPR's man-of-the-match defender Richard Dunne and goalkeeper Robert Green were outstanding in repulsing Derby. Then came the late drama -- with Zamora repeating a feat he achieved in helping West Ham win the playoffs in 2005. It left a distraught Keogh to be consoled by his teammates while QPR lifted the playoff trophy. For McClaren it was a bitter disappointment after guiding his young team to third place in the regular season standings and a deserved place in the final. ""I've lost some games in my career but that is the cruelest,"" he told BBC Sport. ""For somebody to make mistakes -- we don't blame anybody,"" he added.","Queens Park Rangers promoted to English Premier League .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Kay Hagan should be toast by now. She's a Democrat in Republican-leaning North Carolina, voted for Obamacare and is under fire for skipping a meeting of the Senate Armed Services Committee to attend a campaign fundraiser -- a no no in a state with a large military presence. Her Republican opponent, Thom Tillis, is also trying to tie her to the Obama administration's uneven Ebola response. Yet Hagan is surprisingly strong going into next month's election, slightly ahead in most polls at a time when other southern Senate Democrats are in serious danger of losing their seats. Her durability is cheering Democrats in an otherwise miserable year and giving the party a playbook for how to make North Carolina competitive during the 2016 presidential election. ""North Carolina is a political fulcrum on which the nation's politics balances,"" said Josh Stein, a Democratic state senator. Potential 2016 contenders are paying close attention to this year's Senate race. Hillary Clinton will join Hagan at a Charlotte rally on Saturday. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, has campaigned in the state for Tillis . To win, Hagan will have to solidify the coalition from 2008 that helped Barack Obama spring a surprise and become the first Democrat to win North Carolina in a presidential election since Jimmy Carter. The president won the state by turning out record numbers of African Americans along with young, well educated voters moving to Charlotte and the high-tech ""Research Triangle"" of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill. But that base thinned in 2012, returning the state to Republicans. ""It may be that North Carolina becomes a bona fide swing state,"" said Andrew Taylor, a political scientist at North Carolina State University. Hagan is hoping to rev up the base by lambasting Tillis, who is currently the state House speaker, over his unpopular legislature's policies on education and women's issues. She can't afford for any Democrats to stay home, as often happens in midterm elections. OPINION: 4 ways Democrats have already won the midterms . African American turnout -- which could diminish without Obama on the ballot -- will again be crucial and Democrats are furious about new voter registration laws which they say discriminate against their core supporters. Winning the North Carolina battleground won't be easy â€” or cheap. The Senate race is attracting a record amount of outside money -- $55.7 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. A Center for Public Integrity analysis of data collected by Kantar Media/CMAG found North Carolinians have been deluged by nearly 80,000 television ads in a preview of what could be an even costlier presidential campaign in two years time. The intensity will only increase in 2016 if each party thinks the state is up for grabs. For Republicans, maintaining their grip on North Carolina is vital. They would have a hard time finding a path to the White House without it. ""This notion that it used to be a deep red state that is now going Democratic ... is just not an accurate picture of reality,"" said John Hood, president of the open market John Locke Foundation. ""North Carolina is likely to be highly competitive, but I don't see it turning blue,"" he said, noting that the state has in the past sent both staunch conservatives like Jesse Helms and liberals like John Edwards to the Senate. Republicans see a 2014 victory in North Carolina as a crucial bulwark against Democratic encroachment on the coastal south in 2016. A loss now would inevitably spark tough questions about the party's viability in national elections. Tillis campaign sources say they learned the lesson of Obama's mighty turnout machine in 2008 and have spent a year building a field operation. They believe the infrastructure left behind by Obama has frayed and see the state Democratic Party as disorganized. But the Hagan campaign says it has enrolled 10,000 volunteers to identify supporters and make sure they vote. But the Ebola outbreak is transforming the contours of the race, underscoring how quickly the state's political ground can shift. Republicans are slamming Hagan for finally backing an entry ban for citizens of west African nations afflicted by Ebola after she earlier adopted the White House position that travel restrictions would not work. Her delayed flip flop showed a ""lack of leadership and an unwillingness to stand up to President Obama when he is wrong,"" said Tillis spokesman Daniel Keylin. Hagan is staying focused on the party's core issues, calling Tillis ""abysmal"" on women's issues and ""spineless"" on global terror. ""At every step, he's fought for policies that are taking our state backwards,"" Hagan said in a debate in which she positioned herself a moderate. Her survival strategy relies on making Tillis a bigger bogeyman than Obama, so she slams him as the enforcer of the Republican power monopoly in Raleigh, and distances herself from the president by backing the Keystone pipeline and opposing trade deals. While she is a sitting senator running for re-election, Hagan is in effect making Tillis the incumbent and has infuriated Republicans by charging the Tillis-led legislature slashed $500 million in education funding. Republicans believe they've blunted that line of attack with a series of ads but Hagan is keeping it up -- hoping that criticizing Tillis on education will be potent in a state that prides itself on its university system. Hagan has also lacerated Tillis on contraception and goaded him into dismissing a federal equal pay bill as a ""gimmick."" Her efforts opened a gender gap of 12 percent among women voters, according to a Survey USA poll. ""Women voters will be the key to her victory in November,"" said Marcy Stech, national press secretary for EMILY's List, which has poured $3 million into the race.","Kay Hagan is slightly ahead in most polls going into next month's elections .

"(CNN) -- As protests continue across the Middle East, American shoemaker Bahman Irvani remembers 1979. That year, he and his family fled Iran after the revolution leaving behind their thriving footwear business. ""We left Iran because the government took over not only our businesses but our personal assets as well,"" said 59-year-old Irvani, whose family had been manufacturing shoes there for over 50 years. In 1983, the family business was reborn, a long way from Iran, in Buford, Georgia in the United States. Irvani called his new enterprise ""Okabashi"" in honor of the Japanese practice of reflexology and, as the company's website states their shoes have: ""tiny massaging beads are strategically placed across the foot-bed of each shoe to stimulate different areas of the sole."" Having just celebrated the company's 25th anniversary of manufacturing in the U.S., Irvani says his team is really proud to have manufactured 100% of their shoes domestically. To date, Irvani's company has sold over 30-million pairs of the inexpensive ergonomic sandals. Irvani believes too many companies have switched to importing goods, but it's not a trend he's about to start following. ""Our core competency is in manufacturing and what we like to do is design and manufacture really comfortable shoes and I think we do that just as well in the U.S. than doing it overseas."" Two-billion pairs of footwear are sold each year in the United States with 99% of them made overseas. Jason Boswell, vice president of sales for Okabashi credits Irvani for bucking that trend. ""While other companies send their operations overseas and cut corners on quality, Bahman insists on keeping our operations domestic and instead of lowering quality actually increasing it,"" Boswell said. Irvani's factory employs around 200 workers that produce up to 20,000 pairs of shoes each day, with his sandals selling for as little as $12. ""Our shoes get to the American consumer after traveling an average of 800 miles,"" Irvani said, ""compared to Chinese shoes which can travel 12,000 miles on average."" The sandals are 100% recyclable and made of up to 25% recycled material. All the materials Okabashi use are entirely recyclable, Irvani says. ""Very few shoes, by the way, are recyclable -- the leather shoes one wears for example. There are a lot of components going into the shoes so you have to undo them and that process of splitting them up is incredibly time consuming and just not practical. Our shoes are primarily one material,"" he said. The company also takes great pains to ensure a zero waste manufacturing process. ""Obviously not everything comes out beautiful and perfect so we end up with scrap or process waste or returns from customers,"" said Brad Laporte, vice president of manufacturing. The company encourages their customers to return their worn out sandals where they are cleaned, ground up and mixed with the new plastic. The future for Bahman Irvani's company looks bright despite the recent recession -- Okabashi export to 16 countries, including Asia, Laporte says. Irvani has no plans for retirement. His father worked well into his 80s and his son -- 28-year-old third generation shoemaker Hadi -- has taken a more active role in his beloved company. Irvani smiles when asked his thoughts on achieving the American dream. ""The American dream is filled with many sleepless nights,"" he said.","Okabashi footwear lets you send your old shoes back to be recycled .
All new shoes are made with up to 25% recycled material .

"(CNN) -- The shale gas boom in the US is having a surprise knock-on effect in Europe -- a big increase in the burning of coal by European utilities, despite EU environmental policies designed to curb the share of polluting fossil fuels in the energy mix. The trend shows how disruptive shale gas has become for traditional industries, leading to unforeseen -- and often perverse -- outcomes across the global energy system. North America's fracking revolution pushed down US natural gas prices to 10-year lows last spring, prompting electricity generators to switch to gas from coal. Unwanted at home, US coal increasingly found its way on to European markets, where it has displaced more expensive gas as a feedstock for power stations. But many experts believe coal's European revival will be shortlived, and that it is essentially the last gasp of a fuel with no long-term future. The International Energy Agency says the trend of rising European demand is ""close to peaking"", and by 2017 it will drop to levels slightly above those in 2011. Even coal's backers agree that the phenomenon is short-term. ""We don't see this as a renaissance of coal,"" says Milton Catelin, head of the World Coal Association. ""It's just economics."" Coal sceptics say the dirtiest of fossil fuels will inevitably be squeezed out in Europe as new solar and wind capacity comes on stream and ageing coal plants are shut down. Attempts to replace these creaking pieces of kit with new, efficient coal-fired stations are being stymied by environmentalist opposition and regulatory uncertainty, especially in Germany. ""New large-scale power plants and some existing assets are not economically viable in the current environment,"" says Matthias Hartung, chief executive of RWE Generation, which bundles RWE's German, Dutch and UK power plants. According to figures from the European Climate Foundation, a think-tank, in 2008 European utilities had plans for 112 plants. Of these, only two have broken ground and 73 have been abandoned. Long-term, policy analysts say, coal's comeback will inevitably fall foul of EU environmental policy, which calls for a 20 per cent reduction in carbon emissions from 1990 levels by 2020 and a growing role for solar, wind and biomass in electricity generation. For the time being, however, the economics work in coal's favour. American coal exports to Europe increased by 29 per cent last year. The resulting oversupply, exacerbated by a slowdown in Chinese demand, sent European coal prices plummeting from $130 a tonne in March 2011 to around $86 now. That coincided with a sharp fall in the price of carbon allowances under the EU's flagship emissions trading system and rising European prices for natural gas. As a result, the German power generators' association, the BDEW, says gas-fired electricity output in Germany fell last year by 13bn kilowatt hours, or 16 per cent, while coal-fired plants upped output by the same amount, recording a 5 per cent increase to 275.8bn kWh. ""The economics are telling us to burn coal rather than gas,"" says Andrew Horstead, risk analyst at Utilyx, an energy consultancy. Figures from Bloomberg New Energy Finance show power generators in Germany currently earn â‚¬25.2 per megawatt hour when they burn coal and lose â‚¬1.1/MWh when they burn gas. There are also local factors in individual EU countries that have contributed to increased coal use. In the UK, several coal plants are due to close before the end of 2015 under the EU's Large Combustion Plants Directive, which is designed to limit emissions of pollutants from ageing plants. The directive limits the number of hours they can operate before shutting down, and many coal plants are choosing to burn through their remaining permitted hours by April when the UK government introduces a carbon floor price. This will set a price for carbon that is higher than in the European trading scheme, and so entail much higher costs for coal-burners. Another new policy, the emissions performance standard, currently moving through parliament, will prevent any new coal-fired stations being built in the UK that are not equipped with technology to capture and store carbon emissions. Other countries are following similar paths. The Netherlands is introducing a coal tax, Denmark and Finland have announced phase-outs of coal and Spain says it will end coal subsidies. Even Germany, which has huge domestic reserves of cheap lignite, is lowering its reliance on coal. RWE, Germany's largest electricity generator, has reduced the proportion of coal-fired plants from 56 per cent of total capacity in 2006 to about 50 per cent at the end of 2011. By 2020, it sees that dropping to about 35 per cent as the proportion of renewables in the energy mix rises. However, Germany and the Netherlands are due to build 12.5 gigawatts of new coal capacity between 2012 and 2015, offsetting the 11GW that will be retired in the UK over the next four years. ""But a lot of the new plants are replacing older ones,"" says Brian Potskowski of BNEF. ""So there is unlikely to be net growth in coal capacity in western Europe.""","U.S. shale gas boom having knock-on effect in Europe, despite EU environmental policies .

"(CNN) -- It's like motor racing on water -- deafening music blares out in the countdown to races, and fans flock to the water's edge. Welcome to the Extreme Sailing Series, extreme by name and extreme by nature. Expect capsizing, high-speed wipeouts and crashes involving catamarans that are twice the size of the biggest Olympic boats -- and notably faster, reaching top speeds of 30 knots. That's a speed of 35 mph (56 kph) -- maybe not as quick as an elite sports car, but fast enough for huge adrenalin surge. Races take place across the globe, from narrow Amsterdam canal waterways to Sydney's spacious harbor for the season finale. It's also awash with star sailors, including two-time America's Cup winner Ernesto Bertarelli, Ben Ainslie, whose tactics helped guide Team Oracle to victory in San Francisco last year, and 2013 losing skipper Dean Barker. It's no surprise, then, that extreme sailing has been described as the Formula One of the water -- although it's less wheel-to-wheel and more hull-to-hull racing. For his part, Ainslie, himself a F1 fan, likens it to another form of motorsport: ""It's basically sailing's version of stock-car racing. The courses are very short and there are collisions and spills."" This is sailing with a twist, as crews regularly employ guests on board, often celebrities, with the likes of Duran Duran singer Simon LeBon, ex-F1 boss Eddie Jordan, former England cricketer Michael Vaughan and current Wales rugby skipper Sam Warburton having tackled the world's waters in competition. The 2014 season -- the seventh since its inception -- starts in Singapore on Thursday. It will be Ainslie's first race since winning the America's Cup and, as well as being a means to whet his appetite for future events, there is also a more serious purpose to his involvement this time around. ""When you don't race for a long time, it gives you that burning hunger again,"" he says. ""There's definitely the hunger to get back and race, that's what I do. ""The series is a laugh too but it's also the closest thing this year to the multihulls of America's Cup racing, which is the main goal."" Ainslie is still plotting a British team entry into sailing's premier event, aiming to raise the $100 million budget required as well as get the necessary expertise on board to captain his own crew, having helped Oracle storm back from an 8-1 deficit to beat Team New Zealand 9-8 in a thrilling title defense. Yet for all his experience and expertise, the four-time Olympic champion could finish well down the pecking order in the Extreme Sailing Series, when he is paired against sailors for whom the sport is deeply ingrained from seasons past. Among those is compatriot Leigh McMillan, a one-time Olympian who makes no secret of the fact that Ainslie was his hero as he came through the ranks of British sailing. McMillan's boat, The Wave Muscat, is the one to beat as the 33-year-old seeks a hat-trick of titles. ""It's a bit of a dream to be racing against Ben,"" says McMillan. ""He's done fantastic things for the sport of sailing, and I'm excited about the challenge of racing against him. ""I hope to learn a lot from him. If I beat him, it will be the proudest moment of my career. ""Winning events this year will be really, really hard, maybe the toughest season ever. It will be extremely difficult, especially as we're racing against potential America's Cup teams with the resources that go with it."" For his part, McMillan describes the racing, which involves crews of five on the Extreme 40 vessels, with a VIP or guest as well, as ""hectic."" This year's series begins in Singapore and ends in Sydney, with visits to St. Petersburg, Russia, and Istanbul, Turkey among others. Each of the eight rounds of the series are known as acts, such a title adding further to the drama on show. There are four days of racing at each act -- one open-water and three other stadium-racing days in front of the eyes of an expectant public. It's short, sharp racing, each lasting just 10 to 12 minutes, and the first over the finish line wins. Points of a maximum of 10 are awarded for the eight daily races and the crew with the most points at the end of each act is the winner. The team with the highest number of points across all the regattas claims the series trophy. McMillan admits the racing can get nasty on occasion, such is the competitive nature of the sailors. ""I know Ben's got a reputation for being quite aggressive but we can be aggressive too,"" he says. ""I'm quite feisty but also with my experience you have to sail the percentages. You want to stay out of sticky situations, to avoid crashes and to avoid the jury having to make decisions."" Crashes do happen though, and not surprisingly with relative frequency compared to most sailing racing formats. ""I've been involved in the series from the start and I'm still amazed by the adrenalin buzz I get from it each and every time we race,"" adds McMillan. ""You get crashes and it can get quite close for comfort. But the boats are really, really strong -- they're so very well built. If the crashes do happen, things are set up that they're fixed overnight."" Despite some impressive collisions and capsizes, organizer Andy Tourell believes only one boat has lost out a day's racing as a result of a prang -- a remarkable achievement bearing in mind the topsy-turvy nature of this form of racing. Tourrell does not quite agree with Ainslie's stock-car-racing analogy, but he says the unpredictable sailing certainly differs to the F1 seasons of recent years. While Sebastian Vettel has sauntered to four straight titles, McMillan's potential for a treble could well have been scuppered at the final hurdle in 2013. ""Last season came down to the last act of the last race of the last day,"" Tourrell says. ""That gives you an indication of how close it tends to be."" From its outset, the Extreme Sailing Series has tried to be different -- from the element of stadium racing that Tourrell and his team first introduced, to the idea of getting guest sailors, whether they be celebrities, journalists or sponsors. It means crews have to engage in top-flight racing with a complete stranger on board. ""Sailing too often is not accessible to the public, so we wanted to ensure they were within touching distance of the racing,"" says Tourrell. ""It was a huge risk as it had never been done before. We wanted to put boats inside a stadium. Of course, there was some negativity from the purists but I think we're over that now. ""It's been a long road to get this far but it really feels like we're on the brink of taking it to the next level."" See also: Oracle Team USA wins America's Cup .

"(CNN) -- It wasn't the grand announcement fans were hoping for, but it will do. Jay Z's Budweiser ""Made in America"" festival will occur simultaneously in both Los Angeles and Philadelphia over the Labor Day weekend, it was announced on Wednesday. It's the first time the previously star-studded concert series is headed west, and the announcement that the rapper planned a press conference with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti led to speculation that there would be a joint tour with Jay Z's superstar wife, Beyonce. Despite the dashed hopes, it's still a huge deal. Mayor Garcetti says 50,000 fans are expected to attend the two-day event. Philadelphia garnered a $10 million economic benefit from last year's festival thanks to the multitudes who came. ""LA is the music capital of the world,"" Garcetti said. City officials admitted that holding such a festival in downtown Los Angeles will be a logistical challenge. Prior to the announcement, Variety reported that City Councilman Jose Huizar had introduced a motion in March asking for the withholding of permits for the event until the potential disruption to downtown could be assessed. The announcement is yet another financial feather in Jay Z's cap. He and his wife have consistently topped music charts as well as lists of the most successful star couples, including last year's Forbes compilation of the highest-earning celebrity couples. The pair surprised fans this year at the Coachella music festival held in Indio, California, in April. There's no word yet on the lineup, though Jay Z hinted that several genres will be represented. If 2013 is any indication, that will include Beyonce. Last year's performers included Nine Inch Nails, Rick Ross and Skrillex.","Jay Z's two-day festival will is headed to Los Angeles .

"Washington (CNN) -- Even though it was Republican party leaders meeting in Washington this week, Hillary Clinton might as well have been there. Does Obama secretly support Hillary Clinton for 2016? In the halls between Republican National Committee meetings, the former secretary of state's name came up in conversation regularly. At a rules committee meeting on Thursday night, Clinton -- the prohibitive favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 -- was referred to as ""she who should not be named."" And at the powwow's most-watched events, Republicans pledged a laser-like focus on winning back the White House in 2016. It seems as much as some Democrats are trying to fight the coronation of Clinton as their inevitable presidential candidate, most Republican bigwigs in Washington admitted they believe that all roads to the White House go through Clinton. ""I think it is the most realistic assessment,"" said Steve Duprey, national committeeman from New Hampshire. ""It is a party of one giant and a bunch of elves who might be running against her."" ""She has a political organization, she has the history, she has respect from being a senator, first lady, secretary of state, I think it is just prudent for the Republicans to assume she is the nominee and frankly I think it helps focus people,"" he added. Major Obama group will now push for Hillary Clinton . And Republicans aren't wrong about Clinton's front-runner status -- Clinton has topped every poll taken about Democrats for 2016. In the latest Quinnipiac University poll, 65% of Democrats said Clinton would be their choice for the nomination. Vice President Joe Biden was in second with 8%, a whopping 57 points lower. ""Virtually none of the other Democrats could beat her,"" said Saul Anuzis, the former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. ""Now, lots of things could happen, but I think most Republicans assume we are going to run against her."" Since leaving the State Department in 2013, the former secretary of state kept up an active schedule, collecting paychecks on the corporate speaking circuit and picking up hardware at award ceremonies across the country. Hillary Clinton set for California swing in April . Democratic groups have begun lining up behind her possible candidacy in 2016. In addition to groups like Ready for Hillary and Emily's List -- two pro-Clinton fundraising machines -- the liberal Priorities USA moved this week to get behind Clinton and announced they will begin raising big money to help elect Clinton to the White House. The one issue: Clinton has publicly said she is only mulling whether to run for president. Late last year, Clinton said she would decide whether to run or not by the end of this year. In touting Clinton as the inevitable candidate, Republicans have both heaped praise on her -- ""She has a first-rate organization,"" Duprey said -- and tested out attack lines. ""We are doing everything we can do to define her early,"" Matt Moore, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, said about Clinton, who he described as the ""mother of Obamacare."" ""She is an opportunistic person who has been running for president for 20 years."" Moore said the ability to focus on Clinton almost three years out from election day means that the narrative Republicans will push has more time to take hold. Moore sees a parallel between Clinton in 2016 and Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012. ""The trouble we had in 2012 was that our nominee was defined really early over a five- or six-year period and it was hard to break through theses presuppositions,"" he said. He added, for that reason, Republicans ""are preparing in South Carolina and elsewhere that she is the nominee."" Clinton cover gets buzz, criticism .

"(CNN) -- ""Breaking Bad,"" which returns for its fifth and final season July 15, is one of those shows that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as ""The Sopranos,"" ""The Wire"" and ""Mad Men"" when discussing the greatest TV series of all time. Last season's explosive finale saw Walter White (Bryan Cranston), the teacher-turned-meth-maker, kill his boss, drug kingpin Gus Fring, in a horrific, jaw-dropping act that will surely go down as one of the best assassinations in TV history. The moment sets expectations incredibly high for these final 16 episodes, which will air in two parts (the final eight episodes will premiere in the summer of 2013). When creator Vince Gilligan first pitched the show, he described it as ""a story about a man who transforms himself from Mr. Chips into Scarface."" But how do you turn a straight-laced chemistry teacher into a cold-blooded crank cooker and one of TV's most compelling characters? After rewatching all 46 episodes, we highlight 10 key moments that show how Walter White discovered his inner Tony Montana (actually, his inner Heisenberg. More on that.). As each moment unfolds, Walt uses twisted rationalizations to justify his actions, which grow more calculating and manipulative as the series progresses. It's the same sort of manipulation game Gilligan and company are playing with viewers, who first feel sympathy for Walt, but by the end of the fourth season are forced to re-evaluate their loyalties. If you've never watched the show and plan on catching up, consider yourself warned: What follows is an entire list of spoilers. So what caused a seemingly average family man and teacher to break bad? Let's begin with ... 1. The cancer diagnosis (Pilot, season 1) When Walter discovers he has terminal lung cancer, he decides to cook meth to provide money for his family after he's gone. Even though Walt has the brains, he doesn't know squat about the drug business. When he and his partner, former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), attempt to sell their first batch to drug dealers Krazy-8 and his cousin, Emilio, it leads to a hilarious and heart-pounding scene that opens the pilot episode and ends with ... 2. Krazy-8 in the basement (""Cat's in the Bag..."" season 1) To avoid being shot by the two dealers, Walt kills them with a chemical gas. Krazy-8 survives, Emilio doesn't. He'll be first of many deaths directly and indirectly connected to Walt. Because Walt doesn't have the heart to kill Krazy-8, he keeps him trapped in the basement with a bike lock around his neck. With each passing day, Walt grows weary of killing Krazy-8, especially when he realizes that Krazy-8 may have sold him a baby crib when the dealer worked at his father's furniture store as a teen. It's only when Walt realizes that Krazy-8 plans to kill him with a plate shard that he gets up the nerve to choke him. Walt realizes he's not cut out for the drug trade. But then ... 3. Pride gets in the way (""Gray Matters,"" season 1) When his wife (Anna Gunn) reveals Walt's illness to a couple of wealthy friends, they offer to pay for his treatments. But Walt can't bring himself to accept charity. His pride will become a recurring issue throughout the series and is a major factor that drives Walt's darker instincts, which leads to ... 4. The killer alter ego (""Crazy Handful of Nothin',"" season 1) Enter ""Heisenberg,"" Walt's bolder, more cunning alter ego, who literally wears the black (pork pie) hat. Early on, Walt slips on the Heisenberg persona -- the hat, black glasses, black jacket -- as a way to man up when confronting some unsavory characters. But over time, Walt grows more comfortable as Heisenberg, which allows him to lie to himself and his family, which results in ... 5. The ""fugue"" state (""Bit by a Dead Bee,"" season 2) At the start of the series, Walt is able to get by with telling little white lies to keep his family in the dark about is drug activities. But when he needs to explain an extended absence -- after being kidnapped by another crazy drug dealer, Tuco Salamanca -- he comes up with one of his craziest lies yet, which finds him naked in a grocery store with ""amnesia."" It's an example of the extreme lengths Walt will go to keep his misdeeds a secret, which include ... 6.Letting Jane die (""Phoenix,"" season 2) Walt decides to let Jesse's relapsed-junkie girlfriend choke on her own vomit because she knows everything and is the one person he doesn't trust who can expose him. Her death is the best example of the ripple effect Walt's decisions have on everyone around him, including Jane's distraught father, an air traffic controller who accidently causes a mid-air collision between a 737 and a commuter plane, killing 167 people. Though Walt feels guilty about Jane's death, it's just another step in the process that allows him to grow comfortable with eliminating threats, including ... 7. Running over bad guys (""Half Measures,"" season 3) To save Jesse, Walt uses his Pontiac Aztek, one of best comedic devices ever, as a battering ram to take out two drug dealers who, like Walt, work for Gus. Walt realizes it's only a matter of time before Gus decides to get rid of him, which leads to ... 8. Jesse killing Gale (""Full Measure,"" season 3) Gale, Walt's assistant in the super lab set up by Gus, is unaware that he's being groomed to take over so that Gus can kill Walt (Gus tells Gale that Walt is dying of cancer, which by this point is no longer true). Just as Walt is about to be killed by Gus' henchmen, he's able to get a message to Jesse, who does the only thing he can to save his partner. More than one, Jesse has been a victim of Walt's bad decisions (including two very painful beatings) and killing Gale nearly sends Jesse to the brink. Because Gus has no one to run the lab, Walt gets a temporary reprieve, but he knows there's only one thing he can do to stay safe ... 9. Bring down the boss (""Face Off,"" season 4) The season finale's title is a clever play on words that doesn't begin to prepare viewers for Gus' grisly demise. But as brilliant as Walt's plan was, viewers don't learn the full extent of how he pulled it off until the final shot, when we learn ... 10. Walt poisoned a kid (""Face Off"") That final shot -- a slow zoom-in of a plant, lily of the valley, in Walt's backyard -- is the moment viewers realize it was Walt who gave berries from that plant to the son of Jesse's new girlfriend, which sets off a chain events leading to Gus' death. It's the final devious deed that completes Walt's transformation into a ruthless, cold-blooded kingpin. He has become Heisenberg. Will we see his downfall in season 5? Watch and find out.","The hit AMC series ""Breaking Bad"" returns to TV on July 15 .

"(CNN) -- A Republican-appointed commission in Florida could turn the 2012 GOP presidential nominating calendar topsy-turvy Friday if it goes ahead with plans to shift the state's primary to January 31. The move would flout Republican National Committee rules that forbid any state -- other than the first four early voting states -- from holding a contest before March 6, likely sparking a chain reaction as those states move their contests into January to protect their roles in the process. Florida's representatives on the RNC approved the current calendar rules at a meeting last year. But top Florida Republicans have since demanded that their state go fifth in the 2012 process, after the first four ""carve out"" states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. RNC officials had been hoping to allow the Sunshine State to move its contest to Feb. 21, which would still violate party rules but satisfy Florida's desire to go fifth. Florida Republicans told CNN this week, however, that the prospect of states like Missouri and Colorado also holding caucus or primary contests in February forced their hand. What do you think of the candidates? A spokeswoman for the RNC said they were still working to keep the calendar intact. ""We're going to continue working with Florida and other states until the deadline on October 1st to ensure they remain within the Party rules,"" said spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski. ""Any state that violates the rules will lose 50% of its delegates."" Florida Republicans, who want a primary date all to themselves, are not budging, even in the face of penalties from the RNC. ""Nothing has changed,"" said Florida House Speaker Dean Cannon. ""I believe Jan. 31st is the right day for Florida and anticipate the committee making that date official."" Under committee rules, states in violation of the calendar can be stripped of half their delegates to next August's Republican National Convention in Tampa. RNC members are also mulling stiffer penalties for rule-breaking states, like banishing those delegations to far away hotels in the Tampa area and giving their delegations the worst seats inside the convention hall. A spokesman for the Republican Party of Florida brushed off the threats. ""If there is some process in 24 hours time that ensures Florida as fifth, then I think the commission could be swayed,"" said RPOF spokesman Brian Hughes. ""But short of that, the Speaker's prediction seems accurate."" Iowa Republican Party Chairman Matt Strawn issued a joint statement Thursday with his counterparts from New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, promising to leap ahead of Florida and into January if the Florida commission moves ahead with its plan. ""The four sanctioned, early states have been very clear that we will move together, if necessary, to ensure order as outlined in RNC rules,"" Strawn said. ""If we are forced to change our dates together, we will."" The first four states would also face penalties if they move from February into January, but South Carolina GOP Chairman Chad Connelly dared the RNC to punish his state if Florida triggers the chaos. Connelly said he would wait until after Florida finalizes its primary date before naming South Carolina's date. Georgia, which had flirted with moving up its primary date, decided to hold its primary on March 6, in compliance with committee calendar rules.","Florida aims to move primary date to January 31 .

"(CNN) -- Managers will be able to demand review of up to two umpiring decisions beginning full time with the regular season in April, Major League Baseball announced Thursday. And for fans who want a second look at every close play, MLB said it's now OK for the home team to show all replays on the ballpark screens, even if the play isn't being reviewed. ""The new system will give managers valuable recourse in potentially game-changing situations,"" outgoing Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said through a written statement. ""The opportunity for our fans to see more replays in our ballparks is also an important modification that the clubs and I favored."" In past seasons, only home run and other ""boundary"" calls could be reviewed. Beginning next season these decisions can be reviewed: . -- Batter hit by pitch; . -- Fair/foul (outfield only); . -- Fan interference; . -- Force play (except the fielder's touching of second base on a double play); . -- Ground-rule double; . -- Home run; . -- One runner passing another on the base paths; . -- Record keeping (Ball/strike count to a batter, outs, score, and substitutions); . -- Stadium boundary call (e.g., fielder into stands, ball into stands triggering dead ball); . -- Tag on baserunner (including steals and pickoffs); . -- Trapped ball (outfield only); . -- Timing play (whether a runner scores before an unforced third out); . -- Touching a base. A manager will verbally indicate he wants a challenge, MLB said. The replay officials will be based in New York at what MLB calls the Replay Command Center, staffed by more umpires. A replay official will overturn the call if he decides there is ""clear and convincing evidence."" The crew at the stadium will listen for the decision over headsets and won't be able to see the replay as it is being reviewed. Managers may challenge one call. If the challenge results in a call being overturned, the manager is granted a second challenge. The umpiring crew chief may also call for review, provided the play comes after the seventh inning and the manager's challenges are exhausted. A manager may ask for a review of whether a hit should have been called a home run, or vice versa, but that that review will not count as a challenge. The new replay system will be tested during some televised spring training games in March. The decision was approved unanimously Thursday by the owners of the 30 major league teams.","Manager will get a second challenge if he gets first one right .

"(Wired) -- It's almost impossible for a photographer to find fresh visual perspectives these days. Brooklyn-based Zack Seckler had to travel to a different continent and strap into an ultra-light aircraft to find one. His Botswana series presents the country from between 50 and 500 feet, providing a unique and captivating view of the savannah. ""Within the first few minutes of being up there, I was just completely blown away,"" he says. ""Being in that airspace, you're really seeing the world from a perspective that only birds see. Obviously no human on the ground can see that, and the big jumbo jets up above don't fly that low. So it's kind of this hidden airspace to the human eye, and it just immediately struck me as a really powerful visual."" Read more: How a Math Genius Hacked OkCupid to Find True Love . Botswana, in southern Africa, is a little smaller than Texas and hosts large concentrations of animals ranging from wildebeest to zebras to flamingos. Most of it is covered by the Kalahari, a vast stretch of forbidding sandy savannah. It's also the site of the Makgadikgadi Pans, one of the world's largest salt flats and a surreal landscape coated in turquoise algae. The pans and its surrounding marshes and wetlands (known for their baobab trees), as well as the Okavango Delta, became Seckler's visual sandbox as he soared between photo opportunities. The project started in 2009 when Seckler visited Botswana for another assignment and had some downtime. He asked his client to suggest activities to fill his final free days. Seckler was soon introduced to a pilot, who took him on his first ultra-light flight over the salt flats. ""It's just me and the pilot sitting right next to each other, knees practically touching,"" he says. ""There are no real doors, no windows—there's only a windshield, propeller, and wings."" Seckler was hooked, and returned to do three more shoots from an ultra-light and a small Cessna. The animals in this series—impressive when seen up close—become tiny figures that add a sense of scale and isolation. Seckler took thousands of photographs of the landscape itself, but found that even with strong compositions, the pure landscapes could become harder to make sense of. ""They look like they could be a painting; they look like they could be shot from the moon; they look like they could be microscopic bacteria. It's hard to know what it is,"" he says. Read more: Haunting photos of a crumbling post-communist world . Africa's vast wilderness and plentiful wildlife have long tempted photographers, lending themselves to either wide, expansive shots or tight close-ups. Part of what makes the photos in Botswana work is that they straddle a line somewhere in between. The landscapes are comprised of familiar features, but they lose a degree of definition due to their distance from the lens. ""You can make out trees, you can make out animals, you can see things that are recognizable to an extent,"" Seckler says, ""But at the same time because of the bird's-eye view, so to speak, things are slightly abstracted as well."" After graduating from college in 2003, Seckler started working as a photojournalist. By 2008, he had acquired a taste for the more conceptual, hands-on approach of art and commercial photography. His personal projects tend to be thoroughly designed, humorous and forethought visions that require careful planning. The shots in this series, by contrast, were obtained in the midst of a heady, visceral experience, representing yet another departure from form for him. Read more: 7 hand gestures that make you look like a real intellectual . ""With each of those exposures I was trying to do as good a job as I could, but just by its nature it was a very haphazard kind of shooting technique,"" he says. ""For me it was capturing a really unique vision of our world, a beautiful landscape from a unique perspective, and framing moments that create interesting contrast between living things, whether they be animals or flora, and the earth itself."" Seckler says he's been flattered by the response to the series, and credits its positive reception in part to a dearth of public exposure to aerial photography as art. Each photo is carefully composed and subtly balanced against the others in the series, something that would be difficult to achieve with a UAV or octocopter. An overarching palette also unifies the work—a slightly subdued, pastoral tone achieved with slight color correction to certain frames. It's an artistic sensibility that differentiates this work from straight aerial documentary photography. ""There's not a lot of manipulation; it's as you would've seen them if you were in the seat next to me,"" he says. ""They're documentary, but I don't think that precludes them from being art, either."" Photos from Botswana are on display through March 9 at the Robin Rice Gallery in NYC. Read more from WIRED: .

"(CNN) -- Dr. Roberto Bolli's face lights up when he talks about his true love: the human heart. ""The heart is really a miraculous organ. It beats 72 times a minute throughout our life, which means billions of times in our lifetime. And it never gets tired,"" Bolli says. ""It knows exactly how much blood to pump; it can increase its output by fivefold if we need more oxygen -- for example, if we're running or doing strenuous activity. You have 5 billion cells called myocites, all beating in synchrony, in a perfectly coordinated manner, to maximize the heart's pumping ability. It is an engineering feat that never ceases to amaze me."" Bolli was born in Perugia, Italy, the son of a general practitioner. He came to the United States after finishing medical school in Italy, starting at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Since 1994, he's been the chief of cardiology at the University of Louisville, where he also directs the Institute of Molecular Cardiology. Like most physicians, Bolli was taught that heart cells don't regenerate, and that any cells which die from loss of oxygen during a heart attack are lost forever. But the lesson never quite sunk in. Pacemaker pioneer now lives with one . ""That theory always struck me as odd,"" Bolli says now. ""Why would nature demand so much of a single cell, when that same cell must beat 70 times a minute throughout your life? That seems like an unreasonable demand."" Was it possible that new heart cells are constantly born? And could the process be helped along to assist sick patients? For about a decade, scientists have experimented with the use of stem cells to try and repair the heart, mostly in animals and mostly using stem cells derived from bone marrow. In 2009, Bolli was ready to launch the SCIPIO trial (Cardiac Stem Cells in Patients with Cardiomyopathy). Stem cells were taken from patients with severe heart failure and multiplied in a laboratory run by Dr. Piero Anversa at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston. A few months later, each patient was re-infused with a million of his or her own stem cells. The results were dramatic. Patients saw scar tissue replaced by working heart muscle and a significant improvement in their hearts' ability to pump blood. While the numbers are small, other studies have found similarly encouraging results. Bolli has refined his procedure to make it less invasive -- stem cells can now be taken through a catheter -- and none of the patients in cardiac stem cell trials have suffered serious adverse effects. Bolli is hoping to start a larger trial by the fall of 2013.","Dr. Roberto Bolli directs the Institute of Molecular Cardiology in Louisville .

"(CNN) -- Police in southern New Zealand nabbed a would-be burglar after they posted security camera images of him trying to break into a safe on the popular social networking site, Facebook. Having removed his balaclava after his efforts made him hot, the would-be burglar looks up at a security camera. The Queenstown police are calling it their first Facebook arrest. The police department created its online presence on the site just two months ago, said Constable Sean Drader. ""It's pretty popular, isn't it, this site?"" Drader told CNN Wednesday, surprised at the quick success. The 21-year-old masked man allegedly broke into a local pub through a roof early Monday morning and spent considerable time trying to crack open a safe using an angle grinder. ""It's a very small room that he broke into, and it was hot weather. It's summer here,"" Drader said. ""There are sparks flying all about him. And after about an hour, he gets too hot and takes his gloves and balaclava off."" Unable to break open the safe, the man gave up and got ready to leave, Drader said. ""He looks around to see if he's forgotten anything, and he looks up right at the camera. It was rather silly. We got a good look,"" he said. The police department posted the surveillance camera photos on its Facebook page. By the next day, the man was in custody, fingered by viewers who recognized him from the images on the site, and from TV segments on the Facebook posting. Police did not release the suspect's name, but said the Queenstown native is charged with two counts of burglary. Facebook, the Web's most popular social networking site, allows users to create personal profiles. They can then connect with one another, upload photos and share links. The site boasts more than 90 million active users. In November, Facebook helped a seafood restaurant owner in Melbourne identify five customers who dined on oysters, trout and expensive wine and then bolted without paying the US $323 bill. According to media reports, the owner remembered one of the diners asking about a former waitress. The waitress suggested the restaurateur look through her friend's list on Facebook. A quick scroll later, the owner spotted one of the bill dodgers.","Security camera records man unsuccessfully trying to break into a pub's safe .

"(CNN) -- Missionaries from Samaritan's Purse had hoped they wouldn't have to become involved in the clinical care of Ebola patients in West Africa. But by June, they realized they had no choice, says Ken Isaacs, vice president of international programs and government relations for Samaritan's Purse. The deadly Ebola virus had spread from Guinea to Liberia and Sierra Leone. At the time, nearly 400 cases and more than 200 deaths had been reported. Now there are more than 1,711 suspected and confirmed Ebola cases in the region, including 932 deaths, according to the World Health Organization, and the epidemic has spread to Nigeria. Samaritan's Purse believes these numbers represent fewer than half of the real number of cases, Isaacs said Thursday at an emergency congressional hearing on the Ebola outbreak. ""The Ebola crisis we are now facing is not a surprise to us at Samaritan's Purse, but it took two Americans getting the disease in order for the international community and the United States to take serious notice of the largest outbreak of the disease in history,"" Isaacs said. He characterized the initial international response to the Ebola outbreak as a ""failure"" because the virus spread outside the country where the outbreak originated. He said that a broader coordinated intervention is the only thing that will slow the size and speed of this disease. ""The ministries of health in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone do not have the capacity to handle these crises in their countries,"" Isaacs said. If the international community does not get involved, ""the world will be relegating the containment of this disease that threatens Africa and other countries to three of the poorest nations in the world."" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden agrees that the number of people who have been infected with Ebola is likely undercounted. That's in large part, he said at the hearing, because there are a limited number of lab facilities there to confirm the cases accurately. Ebola virus: Nine things to know about the killer disease . That's why developing a better lab system is so important, he said. The CDC is working with international partners, the U.S. Defense Department and the National Institutes of Health to bulk up the lab infrastructure in West Africa and to develop a better way to transport blood samples to those labs. What's most important, Frieden said, is that people understand that there is a clear way to stop this outbreak -- and that's at the source in Africa. This, he said, is the only way to get it under control. ""It's laborious. It's hard. It requires local knowledge and local action."" The roots of our Ebola fears . Stopping the epidemic will be particularly challenging since the local health system is so weak, he said. While the CDC will send at least 50 staff in the next week or two, the health system has to be beefed up to stop and prevent future outbreaks. Frieden said that someone once told him the CDC is the world's 911 system. While he appreciated the compliment, he wants to make sure that every country or region has its own 911. Ebola is here: 5 reasons not to panic . Dr. Ariel Pablos-MÃ©ndez, the assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development's Bureau for Global Health, said that USAID is providing funding to help with the response to this outbreak. They are coordinating a response with local health workers and have provided 35,000 sets of protective equipment, supplies, soap and water. Many health care workers are still laboring in the region without protective gear, which is why these workers make up a large portion of Ebola cases. There was a sense of optimism at the hearing. ""We are confident we can contain and stop the virus,"" said Bisa Williams, the State Department's deputy assistant secretary for the Bureau of African Affairs. The State Department is working closely with the governments of all the countries impacted by the outbreak. They are trying to help health care providers gain access to affected areas. They are also giving technical and financial assistance to treatment centers. Williams said an international response will be essential.

"(CNN) -- ""L.A. Law"" had buzz right from the moment it premiered in 1986. Co-created by Steven Bochco, hot off his success with ""Hill Street Blues,"" the series was set at the high-priced Los Angeles law firm of McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak. The cast was glossy and diverse, including Jimmy Smits, Blair Underwood, Jill Eikenberry, Michael Tucker, Susan Dey, Richard Dysart, Alan Rachins and Corbin Bernsen. Most of all, it pushed the boundaries of the legal show the way ""Hill Street"" did with cop shows. ""L.A. Law's"" principals argued cases involving rape, capital punishment, big business, child molestation, AIDS and medical malpractice at a time when such subjects were seldom mentioned on prime-time television, and certainly not in such detail. This was no ""Perry Mason,"" or even ""The Defenders."" Bochco being Bochco, the hard stuff was paired with moments of silly humor and steamy sex (or silly sex and steamy humor), making for a high-wire balance of drama and comedy. One first-season episode got people talking about a fictional sex act called the ""Venus Butterfly""; later, the show actually killed off a character by dropping her down an elevator shaft. The big hair and big-shouldered suits of the '80s may be gone, but the show remains influential. David E. Kelley, a real-life lawyer who later created ""Picket Fences,"" ""The Practice"" and ""Ally McBeal,"" got his television start as a writer on ""L.A. Law."" The show's first season is finally out on DVD, with the second expected to follow in a few months. CNN spoke to Smits, now a star of ""Sons of Anarchy"" who played idealistic Hispanic attorney Victor Sifuentes, and Alan Rachins, who played bottom-line-oriented partner Douglas Brackman Jr. and later starred on ""Dharma and Greg,"" about the show and its impact. The following is a condensed version of the interviews, which were done separately: . CNN: How did you get the part? Jimmy Smits: I was actually working in Boston at the time doing a ""Spenser: For Hire,"" and a manager sent me the (description) and said it was the guys from ""Hill Street Blues,"" and would I like to go and meet on this? I went to New York to meet some executives, and they threw a bunch of legalese at (me to perform). I'm a slow, kind of methodical study, so I didn't really do very well. I was so depressed. One of my friends in California said, ""You didn't meet this Bochco guy. You met some lady who was weeding people out! Get on a People Express flight and stay with me and try to get in and set up another appointment."" I borrowed money, came out here -- and eventually got an audition with Steven Bochco and (director) Gregory Hoblit. I met with Steven and he has all this sports memorabilia and he was swinging a baseball bat, and I said, if it doesn't go well, do I get one of those over my head? But it went well. Alan Rachins: I'm married to Bochco's sister (Joanna Frank, who later played Brackman's wife, Sheila, on ""L.A. Law""), which is how we were able to invite him to the L.A. film festival to see Henry Jaglom's film ""Always."" It was right at the time when (Bochco) was developing ""L.A. Law."" What I did in that particular Jaglom film was the spark that brought Brackman to me. CNN: I understand the portrait of Brackman's father was of your actual dad? Rachins: That was my dad. Considering they made a point in the pilot that Douglas was the son of one of the co-founders and that Douglas didn't quite measure up to the great man his father was, my father's picture had a certain amount of charisma to it and I thought it was really apt. My relatives were thrilled and delighted that he was there. When there was an episode where my father's picture did not get on screen, I'd get a call from one of my relatives saying, ""Alan! No picture! What happened?"" CNN: When did you know you were a hit? Smits: At the end of the second or third season, I was on a plane going back to New York a lot, and there was a person I was sitting next to who worked in admissions in colleges. And they were going to some convention and they were talking about how the number of law school applications had skyrocketed since the show had aired. That's when I knew we were making an impact. Rachins: Lawyers liked the show. They often wrote the writers to ask for a particular summation on a case they were working for that they saw on the show, so they could incorporate it into their own summation. And every once in awhile, a guy would come up to me and say, ""I'm the Brackman"" -- he's the business guy in his law firm. CNN: Tell us about the camaraderie. Smits: The conference room scenes took a long time to shoot because it was a circular table and you had to shoot it a particular way. But it was such a great time we had during those conference room scenes because we were all together and we were always talking about the work. It felt like we were part of a theater ensemble. Rachins: One of the things that made it such a happy set was how everyone's character was served through the years, so that no one ran away from the show. It was an ensemble that had everyone making terrific contributions. CNN: What were some of your favorite moments? Smits: I remember James Earl Jones working on a case, and he's kind of an idol of mine, and it was Susan (Dey)'s case with him, but I do remember coming in one or two days just to see how he'd handle closing arguments. Rachins: My character had some interesting adventures with women, including my wife, so when I had some battles with my wife (on the show), that was fun. And the affairs I had -- one with my father's former mistress, and another with a sex therapist, were particularly adventurous and fun. CNN: What are you up to now? Rachins: I'm looking for that third TV series. I loved my first two -- I got to work with Steve Bochco, one of the best ever, and Chuck Lorre, one of the best ever. I have an independent film and guest spots here and there. Fingers crossed, I'm looking for that third series. Smits: I think the (""Sons of Anarchy"") writers room gets together in late March, beginning of April. We start (shooting) in May. (So) I'm trying to look for jobs, man. You're always doing ""Death of a Salesman."" It's always Willy Loman, knocking on doors.","The first season of ""L.A. Law"" is out on DVD .

"(CNN) -- A fan of Dutch football team Ajax is in a serious condition in hospital after falling from the stands of the club's Amsterdam ArenA stadium on Tuesday. The fan is said to have fallen while celebrating Ajax's second goal, scored by Danny Hoesen, during a 2-1 European Champions League win over Barcelona. Amsterdam Police confirmed on Twitter that the supporter who had fallen approximately five meters and had been taken to hospital where he was in a serious condition. From the same account the police later denied social media rumors that the fan had died. The Ajax press office was not immediately available for comment, though the club's Twitter feed sent the fan its best wishes. Pictures on social media appear to show the man lying motionless in a pool of blood. The incident comes days after a similar event at the Oakland Raiders vs. Tennessee Titans National Football League game on Sunday. A 61-year-old Marine veteran used his body to break the fall of a woman who had seemingly thrown herself from the third level of the Oakland Coliseum. The woman suffered a head wound while the man sustained non-life-threatening injuries. European football's governing body UEFA stipulates that all Champions League matches must be played in all-seater stadia. Ten-man Ajax's win over Barcelona handed the Catalans their first defeat under coach Gerardo Martino. After beating Celtic in Glasgow AC Milan remain second in Group H with nine points behind Barca, who have already qualified for the knockout stages, but Ajax are now only one point behind the Italian side on eight. The Dutch side will qualify for the last 16 if they can beat Milan at the San Siro stadium in the final round of Group H matches on December 11.","Ajax fan sustains serious injuries after falling from the stands on Tuesday .

"Washington (CNN) -- The political scandal involving vendettas and traffic jams ensnarling New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's administration could stall the expected presidential hopeful's career ambitions if he can't convince voters his apologies are sincere. So a chastened Christie, his trademark braggadocio only somewhat in check, did what problem-plagued politicians have done in recent years when they faced scandals: offer mea culpas with a heavy emphasis on the ""me"" part. Bold? Yes. Effective? We'll see, said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. ""If he told the truth, he'll be fine,"" Sabato said. ""As long as he wasn't involved in the act itself and the cover-up and he fired those involved he's fine. If he lied, it's over."" But there are times when it might be more politically advantageous to lie at first, then come clean later, Sabato said. Christie drops swagger amid heat of scandal . Bill Clinton . Former President Bill Clinton was a veritable maestro of careful and calculated confessions during a career riddled with sexual scandals. His MO during these salacious sagas apparently was not to come clean until it was advantageous. Hopped in the sack with model Gennifer Flowers? Nope. Then later, ""yes."" That admission, following rumors of his sexual indiscretions, helped him pull off a second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary and earn the moniker of ""Comeback Kid."" As president he initially said, ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky."" Of course, that all depended on how Clinton defined sex. He later admitted to the affair and apologized to the country. We'll spare you a trip down memory lane about the affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and just say that one stained blue dress and an impeachment later, Clinton was acquitted and remained in office. Mark Sanford . The former South Carolina governor-turned-congressman, Mark Sanford, pulled a disappearing act on the public's dime and time all in the name of love. He was able to rehabilitate his career after revelations he disappeared from office for days and, at some point, had used public funds to fly to Argentina for trysts with his mistress. He bared his soul in news conferences and interviews with the media professing his love for the woman, Maria Belen Chapur, and apologizing for the hurt he caused his family. State lawmakers censured him, but he served out his term and later was elected to Congress in a special election in 2013. Mark Sanford has a woman problem . It worked out for those guys, but more often than not, political experts say, lies and especially cover-ups tank political careers. John Edwards . Take John Edwards, a politician who did not fare as well as Clinton in a sex scandal. Edwards, a Democratic presidential candidate for 2008, initially denied tabloid reports in 2007 that he had an affair with and fathered a child by campaign worker Rielle Hunter. Then he owned up to the affair but not the kid. Then, after details emerged about a plot in which campaign staffer Andrew Young falsely claimed paternity and campaign funds used to support Edwards' secret family, the candidate finally admitted in 2010 that he was indeed the baby's daddy. Rod Blagojevich . Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich had a penchant for Charvet ties, a big personality and big hair, and he made some big promises about filling President Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat. Guess which one was illegal? Nonetheless, Blagojevich took to the networks to proclaim his innocence. Neither the U.S. attorney's office nor Illinois state lawmakers believed him; the feds indicted him for ""pay to play"" schemes, and Blagojevich was impeached by the state House and Senate. He has since appeared on ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and penned a book. Now he's in prison, with plenty of time to work on his acting and writing chops. Larry Craig . Sen. Larry Craig, a conservative lawmaker from Idaho who'd taken hardline positions against homosexuality, found himself in a gay sex scandal in 2007. His comments about having a ""wide stance"" became late-night TV fodder after his arrest in the men's room at the Minneapolis-St.Paul International Airport. He was accused of soliciting sex from an undercover police officer by using hand signals and tapping his foot in a bathroom stall. Craig first pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of disorderly conduct, then said he regretted that plea. He said he was going to resign, then changed his mind about that, too. He ultimately served out the rest of his term and did not seek re-election. Then there were those baffling New York political sex scandals. Eliot Spitzer . Former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer fessed up to his involvement in a high-priced hooker ring during a 2008 scandal that rocked the Empire State. He recently lost a bid to become New York City comptroller. And, for good measure, shortly after his inauguration as governor, David Paterson, the lieutenant governor who stepped up to fill in when his boss resigned, confessed that he and his wife both had extramarital affairs and that he used cocaine in his youth. Anthony Weiner . And we all saw way too much of former Rep. Anthony Weiner during a 2011 sexting scandal. He originally denied posting a lewd selfie to one of his Twitter followers but later came clean during an uncomfortable and awkward press conference. He resigned from office, but we were treated to Weinergate part deux when, during the 2013 New York City mayor's race, more explicit pictures emerged. Can Rep. Anthony Weiner survive Weinergate? Trey Radel . And just this week, U.S. Rep. Trey Radel, R-Florida, returned to work on Capitol Hill for the first time after pleading guilty to cocaine possession in November. He went to rehab and then set about rehabilitating his career by apologizing for his actions. ""I cannot express how sorry I am. I ask for your forgiveness. I've let down our entire country. I have let down my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I've let down my family,"" Radel told reporters Tuesday in his office, his voice full of emotion.","When faced with scandal, some politicians fare better than others .
But it might be more politically advantageous to fess up later, political observers say .
Lies and especially cover-ups can tanks careers, they say .

"(CNN) -- The political infighting in Washington took on global importance Thursday when the ratings agency Standard & Poor's released a report saying it would downgrade the world's largest economy's credit rating if a deal to raise its debt ceiling is not agreed on soon. This comes after similar warnings from Moody's and Finch -- who, along with S&P, are known as the ""Big Three"" global credit ratings agencies. Meanwhile, European Union markets reeled this week after Moody's recent credit downgrades of Ireland, Greece and Portugal -- heightening fears that the EU debt crisis will hit the larger economies of Italy and Spain. Government officials on both sides of the Atlantic have railed against the agencies. So how did the global economy become so dependent on the opinions of three companies? Who are the credit rating agencies? The ""big three"" are Standard's & Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings. All originated in the United States, although Fitch has dual headquarters in New York and London. What do they do? Before you can get a credit card, banks run a credit check on you. Similarly, the ratings agencies run credit checks on companies, countries and financial products. Countries are rated on a sliding scale: the U.S., for example, has a top rating (AAA) which allows it to borrow cash at cheap interest rates. The lower the rating grade, however, the higher interest payments a nation must pay to attract investors to buy its bonds. Anything that slips to junk status -- as Ireland, Portugal and Greek government bonds are rated -- is considered a ""highly speculative"" investment. Furthermore, the pool of eligible investors is reduced -- many institutional investors, such as government pension funds, are forbidden to invest in junk-rated bonds. Why do they wield such power? Investors across the world look to credit rating agencies to judge where to place their bets in the market. For governments, the ratings agencies have a lot of power over the popularity of bonds: cash given to governments by investors that, over time, will pay a return on the original investment -- unless the government defaults. The downgrade of Ireland this week signaled Moody's belief that Ireland has a higher likelihood to default on investments. And global investors have little appetite to invest in those bonds. What does a debt rating downgrade mean? The decisions of the ""Big Three"" catalyze market moves in often unpredictable ways, creating a strong ripple effect. In the wake of the Greece downgrade last year, for example, investors across the globe started rethinking investment in other governments' bonds and began selling off more risky investments -- throwing the EU into crisis and depressing the value of the euro. There was a similar psychological ripple through the markets this week after Moody's recent downgrades of Ireland and Portugal -- it put the spurs to Italian lawmakers to pass deep cuts in government spending on Thursday and turning up the heat on Washington lawmakers to extend the debt ceiling. How are ratings agencies paid? Historically, they were created to give investors an unbiased assessment of investments and investors paid for access to the ratings. In the 1970s, however, credit rating agencies started charging the issuers of new investments fees for ratings. In 1975, U.S. legislators -- fearing a proliferation of unscrupulous ratings agencies -- designated Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch as the only ratings organizations banks and brokers could use to evaluate the credit worthiness of their products. What are the complaints against the firms? Critics complain the agencies have lost their ability to independently judge the risk on certain investments -- especially in light of AAA ratings given to mortgage-backed securities that imploded when defaults on U.S. home loans shot up, triggering the financial crisis. Critics also note that the agencies are paid by the very entities they rate, raising questions about their trustworthiness. ""No nation, agency or organization has the authority to dictate terms to the United States Government,"" U.S. Congressman Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, said on Wednesday after Moody's placed the U.S. on review for a possible downgrade. ""Moody's is representing people who stand to gain from the U.S. being able to issue more financing. This is an unwarranted interference in the political process and continues to raise questions about conflicts of interest among the rating agencies."" In a speech Monday in Paris, Michael Barnier, a member of the European Commission in charge of Internal Market and Services, said: ""We need to be more demanding when it comes to how credit ratings agencies rate sovereign debt. ""These ratings play a crucial role not only for the rated countries but for all our countries: a downgrading has the immediate effect of making a country's borrowing more expensive, it makes states weaker, and there are possible effects of contagion on neighboring economies."" The agencies say they have revamped their procedures since the credit crisis. They also argue their ratings are merely opinions -- protected by free speech laws -- and ultimately, it's up to the markets to decide.","""Big Three"" are Standard's & Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings .

Critics on both sides of the Atlantic say the agencies have too much power .

"(CNN) -- In his bid to replicate Barcelona's unprecedented success at Bayern Munich, Josep Guardiola has a secret weapon -- a gold medal-winning water polo player. In front of a crowded press room, and in fluent German, Guardiola outlined his pride at taking control of the recently-crowned European champions on Monday. Earlier this year Bayern surprised the football world by announcing Guardiola would replace Jupp Heynckes as the club's coach for the 2013-14 football season, with the Bavarians subsequently going on to clinch an historic European, German League and German Cup treble. And as he attempts to match the success the club enjoyed under Heynckes, Guardiola will have Manuel Estiarte at his side, a man who worked with the new Bayern coach at Barca and who won Olympic gold at the Atlanta 1996 Games. ""He has participated in many Olympic Games,"" said Guardiola. ""I like to take his influences from other sports, he will help us."" As well as Estiarte, Guardiola has brought three other members of his backroom staff from his Barcelona days -- assistant coach Domenec Torrent, scout and video analyst Carles Planchart and fitness coach Lorenzo Buenaventura, . ""It's great that these people were willing to follow me,"" added Guardiola. ""This is a challenge also for the families, I hope that we manage it well."" Guardiola forged his reputation at Barca, where he won 14 trophies in four years, including two European Cups, between 2008 and 2012 before deciding to take a sabbatical from the sport. His achievements in Catalonia, and the style in which Barca achieved success, made the former midfielder one of the most sought after coaches in the world. But Bayern's heritage -- the club has been crowned champions of Europe on five occasions -- tempted Guardiola. ""The decision to come to the club was based on its history and its players,"" continued Guardiola. ""It's a fresh challenge for me, my time in Barcelona was wonderful, but I needed a new challenge. ""Bayern Munich gave me the opportunity, I am prepared to give my best. I'm ready."" Having spent the majority of his career with Barca, Guardiola is aware of the pressure that comes with working for one of the world's biggest clubs. ""At the top clubs, you are always under pressure but I believe in myself and I accept this challenge without a problem,"" said the 42-year-old. ""I will, of course, make changes, but I want to keep the level that Bayern has already achieved."" Guardiola also spoke in glowing terms of Heynckes, who has announced he will not be taking a coaching role for the new season. ""I have had no contact with Jupp Heynckes but I hope to speak with him in the next few days,"" added Guardiola. ""I have a lot of respect for his achievements and it would be good to have his opinion. It's an honor to be his successor, especially after the way his team played last season."" Earlier on Monday, Tottenham Hotspur coach Andre Villas-Boas suggested the biggest task facing Guardiola will be to impose his brand of football onto the German champions. ""His (Guardiola's) challenge is to transport his (possession football) paradigm to another culture,"" said former Porto and Chelsea manager Villas-Boas. ""It's like what I tried to do at Chelsea: it's counter cultural.""","Josep Guardiola unveiled as coach of Bayern Munich .

"(CNN) -- It took years to get through -- an increase in the fee airline passengers pay for airport screening and other government-run aspects of aviation security. It takes effect this summer but now already President Barack Obama wants those who travel by air to pick up even more of the security tab. For more than a decade, the so-called 9/11 fee has been $2.50 for a one-way ticket -- or $5 with one or more connections. On a typical round-trip flight with connections, the maximum was $10. Under a bipartisan budget deal signed into law by Obama in January, passengers will pay $5.60 one-way, regardless of connections, beginning July 1. That brings a round-trip fee to $11.20. Now Obama is proposing to raise the fee to $6 for a one-way trip, or $12 for the typical round trip. The increase, the administration says, will make the fees ""more closely reflect the costs of passenger screening and other aviation security services."" The security fee currently brings in about $1.7 billion a year in revenue. By law, the first $250 million is set aside for a fund that provides airport facility modifications and certain security equipment, according to the House Budget Committee. The remaining amount goes to the Transportation Security Administration, but covers only about 30 percent of the agency's aviation-related security costs. Under the current budget plan, the higher fee will raise that number to about 43 percent of the total cost. It is unclear what percentage of the total cost will be covered if the $6 fee becomes standard. But it's also unclear what parts of Obama's budget proposals will be adopted, if any. The Bush and Obama administrations sought for years to raise the fee without success, making the request a staple of annual budget proposals. They were resisted by key lawmakers and the airlines, who consider aviation security a national security priority that government should cover. But Republicans slowly warmed to the idea of a fee increase as a way to cut government spending in an era of fiscal austerity.","First increase in aviation security fee in years takes effect in July .

"(CNN) -- The two latest fires in a string of church blazes in east Texas have been ruled arson, bringing the total of deliberately-set fires to 10, authorities said Thursday. Fires destroyed Dover Baptist Church and Clear Spring Missionary Baptist Church on Monday night. The churches are located about three miles apart near Tyler, Texas. There have been a total of 11 church fires so far this year, said Tom Crowley, special agent from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' Dallas, Texas, office. One has not been ruled arson. Included in that total is a January church arson in Temple, Texas. Authorities are not sure whether the Temple fire is related to the other nine, which have been concentrated in an area east of Dallas, more than 150 miles from Temple. There is no clear theme linking the fires, which have struck churches of different denominations, including Baptist, Methodist and Church of Christ Scientist, on different days of the week and at different times of the day, Crowley has said. While the churches are located in small towns, not all of them are in remote locations, he told CNN. Authorities believe one person, or perhaps a group of people, are responsible, he said. Crowley told CNN Thursday investigators were still tracking down leads. ""I think maybe I would characterize the mood of our people as perplexed,"" Randy Daniels, mayor of Athens, Texas, told CNN on Tuesday. Athens, a town of about 12,000 people, has had three of its church set on fire. He and others spoke of communities on edge. Police patrols have been stepped up near east Texas churches, while in some cases, church members are staying at their churches to protect them or patrolling churches themselves. In Tyler, Texas, the Tyland Baptist Church was among those set ablaze. Pastor David Mahfood told CNN on Wednesday there was nothing left from the January 16 fire -- ""not a Bible, not a hymnal. We've got some bricks. That's it."" At another destroyed church, Russell United Methodist Church in Wills Point, Texas, members are trying to salvage what they can from the ashes. A large brass cross that hung over the church's choir loft was recently found, church member Kay Crosby told CNN. ""It was kind of twisted, but we're going to have it restored,"" she said Wednesday.","Churches destroyed Monday were just three miles apart .

"(CNN) -- With 20 U.S. states allowing medical marijuana, and others weighing its medicinal or recreational use, advocates of looser laws on weed appear to have the advantage. But leading medical groups remain ambivalent, and opponents are now trying to mobilize for upcoming votes in three states. Florida will vote on whether to legalize the medicinal use of marijuana in November. In New York and Georgia, the state legislatures are debating medical marijuana, while the District of Columbia City Council voted Tuesday to decriminalize possession of small amounts of pot. Meanwhile, two more states -- Oregon and Alaska -- are expected to follow the lead of Colorado and Washington and put full legalization on the ballot in 2014. And in the year-plus since the Colorado and Washington votes, public opinion has swung sharply in favor of loosening marijuana laws. ""That caught everyone, even advocates, by surprise,"" said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the pro-legalization Drug Policy Alliance. In January, a CNN/ORC International survey found 55% support for legalization, with 44% opposing it. National polls shifted by about 10 percentage points between late 2012 and late 2013, with support for legalization climbing to roughly the same level seen in the CNN poll, Nadelmann said. ""A lot of people just began to relax and see the sky's not going to fall. All we're doing is moving a booming market from the underground to the legal world,"" he said. Those trends were seen even in states like Louisiana, where Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal told CNN in February that he'd be open to the ""tightly regulated"" use of medical marijuana. ""If you look at public opinion polls, support for legalizing medical marijuana is over 70% nationally, even in the South,"" Nadelmann said. Interactive map: A look at marijuana laws in the U.S. There's also growing pressure to change the drug's classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, the federal designation for a drug with high risk and no medical use. CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who hosts an upcoming documentary on the issue, argues that ""Neither of those statements has ever been factual."" Changing the designation would allow scientists to put the drug's purported benefits and risks under closer scrutiny, advocates argue. ""I have sat in labs and personally analyzed the molecules in marijuana that have such potential but are also a source of intense controversy. I have seen those molecules turned into medicine that has quelled epilepsy in a child and pain in a grown adult. I've seen it help a woman at the peak of her life to overcome the ravages of multiple sclerosis,"" Gupta writes. ""I am more convinced than ever that it is irresponsible to not provide the best care we can, care that often may involve marijuana."" Two drugs based on chemical compounds found in marijuana -- including the active ingredient, THC -- have been approved by federal regulators and are available by prescription. A cannabis-based mouth spray used to relieve chemotherapy side effects has been approved in Canada and parts of Europe and has been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its review. The American Cancer Society says research indicates that cannabis derivatives can help alleviate the pain and nausea associated with chemotherapy, but it opposes marijuana smoking or legalization. And in November, the American Medical Association reiterated its stance that marijuana is ""a dangerous drug"" that should remain illegal. But it also called for additional research and the use of ""public health based strategies, rather than incarceration"" to control it. Meanwhile, opponents say residents of Colorado and Washington -- which issued its first marijuana licenses Wednesday -- may be feeling some buyers' remorse. ""The white coats are off,"" said Kevin Sabet, director of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana. Sabet is a former White House drug policy adviser who co-founded SAM with former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, who has publicly battled his addiction to drugs and alcohol. In a letter to federal regulators, the Justice Department and the White House this week, Sabet, Kennedy and representatives of several leading anti-drug organizations argued that removing marijuana from the Schedule I list ""would be a mistake."" ""We do strongly support efforts to research the components of marijuana. We should break down the barriers of such research by making it easier for researchers to access, store, and administer such components,"" they wrote. But that can be done without contributing to ""the normalization of marijuana,"" they argued. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: 'I am doubling down' on medical marijuana . In states that have voted in marijuana, Sabet said, residents are uncomfortable with the rise of a new weed industry. ""What they're getting is cookies and candies and ring pops that are targeted at kids. What they thought they were getting was allowing adults to smoke unencumbered in their own basement,"" he said. Sabet said federal laws banning pot aren't changing ""anytime soon."" His organization is raising money and recruiting volunteers to fight the expected votes in Alaska and Oregon. But he said anti-drug forces expect to lose votes in more states before a backlash against legalization can take root. ""We don't need to have voting on medicine,"" he said. ""We need to have medicine in pharmacies that can be prescribed by doctors.""","20 U.S. states now allow medical marijuana .
Leading medical groups remain ambivalent on the issue .
There is growing pressure to change marijuana's Schedule I classification .

"Washington (CNN) -- His party got its clock cleaned in Tuesday's midterm elections, but President Barack Obama still remains competitive in some hypothetical 2012 presidential election matchups, especially against Sarah Palin, a new poll shows. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Thursday also indicates that at the unofficial start of the race for the Republican presidential nomination, the field of possible contenders appears wide open with no front-runner. Twenty-one percent of Republicans say they would most likely support 2008 GOP White House candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee for their party's 2012 presidential nomination, according to the poll. The number is 20 percent for another 2008 Republican presidential hopeful, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Fourteen percent say they support Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, with 12 percent backing former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia. The remaining candidates, whose names were all in single digits, are led by Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, who also ran for the GOP presidential nomination the last time around, followed by Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. The poll's release comes as Santorum visits New Hampshire to give a speech about the midterm election results and the future of the Republican party. No one has yet to announce a bid for the GOP nomination. In a possible general election showdown, Obama leads Palin 52-44 percent among all registered voters. ""Looking ahead to 2012, it may be too early to count Barack Obama out, particularly if Sarah Palin is his opponent,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""The former Alaska governor gets a lot of attention, but she is in third place when Republicans are asked to pick a presidential nominee, and in a hypothetical matchup with Obama she is arguably the weakest candidate of the top-tier GOP hopefuls."" In a hypothetical 2012 matchup, Huckabee leads Obama 52 - 44 percent, while Romney has a 50-45 point advantage, which is within the poll's sampling error. Obama holds a 49-47 percent margin over Gingrich. The poll indicates that four in 10 have a favorable opinion of Palin, with nearly half saying they have an unfavorable view. Romney has a 36 percent favorable rating and a 29 percent unfavorable rating, with 35 percent unsure. Forty-two percent say they see Huckabee in a positive light, with 26 percent saying they hold a negative view and just over three in 10 are unsure. Gingrich has 32 percent favorable rating, with four in 10 saying they have an unfavorable view, and 28 percent unsure. On the Democratic side, nearly three-quarters of Democrats say they want to see the party renominate Obama in 2012. Why does that matter? ""No incumbent president has faced a significant primary challenge and gone on to win re-election in November, Holland added. ""Contested primaries make incumbents look weak and overly-political, and prevent the incumbent from building up goodwill while the opposition party candidates are fighting among themselves."" Avoiding a primary challenge won't guarantee Obama victory in November 2012, but the fact that 73 percent of Democrats want to see the party renominate Obama may scare off any Democrats who are contemplating a run against him, and that gets him one step closer to a second term. The poll of 1,006 adult Americans, of which 921 were registered voters, was conducted by phone October 27-30, before the midterm elections. The sample also included 500 respondents who describe themselves as Republicans or independents who lean Republican, and 453 respondents who describe themselves as Democrats or independents who lean Democratic. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. CNN also conducted exit polls on Election Day in some of the states that vote first in the presidential primary calendar. In Iowa, 21 percent of Republicans questioned as they exited the voting booth said that Romney was their likely choice in the 2012 Iowa caucuses, with Huckabee also at 21 percent, Palin at 18 percent, Gingrich at 7 percent and one in five saying they would support another possible candidate. In New Hampshire, 39 percent of Republicans said that Romney is their likely choice in the state's primary, with Palin at 18 percent, Huckabee at 11 percent, Gingrich at eight percent and 19 percent saying they would back another possible contender. Twenty-five percent of South Carolina Republicans say Palin would be their likely primary choice, followed by Huckabee at 24 percent, Romney at 21 percent and Gingrich at 10 percent. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is the favorite for the GOP 2012 presidential nomination .

"(CNN) -- We're in the home stretch of the Sochi Winter Olympics, with the final week of competition under way. NBC's Bob Costas plans to return to the broadcast booth Monday after being sidelined with an eye infection for a few days. More importantly, Monday will determine whether we'll get to see a repeat of one of the most intense rivalries in sports. And it will offer us a taste of the chaotic world of snowboard cross. Here are five events to watch at the Sochi Winter Olympics on Monday: . 1. Ice Dancing . Americans Meryl Davis, 27, and Charlie White, 26, are favorites to win gold in ice dancing. They were the world champions in 2011 and 2013 -- and could become the first Americans ever to become Olympic champions in ice dance. On Sunday, they not only won the short dance part of the competition; they scored a world-record 78.89 points. The free dance takes place Monday. Who else to watch: . Davis and White's chief rivals - Canadians Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, who came in second in the short dance Sunday. But they are the defending Olympic champions, having won gold at the Vancouver games four years ago. 2. Women's Ice Hockey . Though it doesn't get the attention it should, the U.S vs. Canada women's ice hockey is one of the most intense rivalries in sports. Since the sport was included in the Olympics in 1988, no other country but these two have taken home the gold. The Canadians won gold in 2002, 2006 and 2010. The U.S. won in 1998. The teams want to face each other again in the gold medal game -- but first, they have to win their semifinals Monday. The U.S. faces Sweden at 7:30 a.m. ET and Canada plays Switzerland at noon. Who to watch: Julie Chu, one of the U.S.'s top players, injured her hand in practice Saturday but is expected to play. 3. Men's two-man bobsled . One of the feel-good stories of Sochi was the return of the Jamaican bobsled team after a 12-year absence. The sunny, snowless Caribbean island inspired the Disney movie ""Cool Runnings"" after fielding a four-man team to the Calgary games in 1988. But Jamaica never got any traction at Sochi. After the first round of heats Sunday, Winston Watts and Marvin Dixon of Jamaica are 30th among 30 teams. Last place. The second day of heats is Monday. Russia holds a big lead, followed by Switzerland, the U.S. and Canada. Who to watch: . The Russians. Could this be their year? They won silver in 2006 and bronze in 2010. Taking the gold before a home crowd would be especially sweet for them. Who else to watch: . Steven Holcomb, piloting for the U.S., helped the U.S. four-man team win gold in Vancouver in 2010. He'll be piloting the two-man team as well. The U.S. has not won gold in the two-man event since 1936 and last medaled in 1952 in Oslo. 4. Men's aerials . The aerials event is one of the most visually impressive in the Winter Games, with athletes launching themselves off ski jumps to perform multiple somersaults in the air before landing. The favorites are Qi Guangpu and Liu Zhongqing, both of China, and Anton Kushnir of Belarus. Zhongqing won a bronze at Vancouver. The qualifying rounds and the finals will be held Monday. Athletes are judged on technique in their takeoff, jump form and landing. Who else to watch: . The United States has one entrant, 18-year-old Mac Bohonnon. 5. Snowboard Cross . In this event, four athletes on snowboards simultaneously race down a course with jumps, obstacles and banks. It sounds chaotic and sometimes it is. Monday will be a busy day, with seedings followed by four other rounds of competition. Markus Schairer, 26, of Austria is one of the favorites to win gold. Like most snowboarders, he has suffered multiple injuries during his career, including tearing his anterior cruciate ligament twice and breaking his chin, arm, finger, shoulder and some ribs. Who else to watch: . Omar Visintin of Italy and Jarryd Hughes of Austria have competed strongly throughout the competitions leading up to the Olympics.","Jamaica is in last place in the two-man bobsled .
U.S., Canadian women's hockey teams compete in semis .
Americans Meryl Davis and Charlie White are favored to win ice dancing .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods' career may or may not be on the wane, but the fortunes of his niece, Cheyenne are most definitely on the rise. The 23-year-old, who is the daughter of Tiger's older half-brother Earl Dennison Woods Jr., stormed to her first major tour title on Sunday winning the Australian Ladies Masters. Woods, fired a four-under par 69 in the final round at the RACV Royal Pines Resort course on Queensland's Gold Coast to finish on 16-under, two shots better that 17-year-old Australian amateur Minjee Lee. ""This is a huge accomplishment for me,"" Woods said afterwards at the event sanctioned by the European and Australian Ladies' Tour. ""All off season I was just getting ready with my coach back home and he told me he thinks that this is my year, my time to finally get a win and to have it this early in the season is exciting, especially with the European Tour and then here in Australia,"" she added. ""I'm just really proud with how I played this week and followed through all four days and finished strong."" Woods, who turned pro in 2012 and joined the Ladies European Tour last year, had a one-shot lead after 54 holes and got off to the best possible start in the final round opening up with a birdie. A bogey followed at the fourth, but it was the only blot on her scorecard. A birdie at the ninth and then three more on the back nine, including a birdie four at the last, saw her secure top spot. Along with an elegant crystal trophy, Woods picked up a winner's check for â‚¬37,500 ($51,000), nearly five times more than Tiger has earned on the PGA Tour so far this year. Woods missed the cut in her last tournament -- the New Zealand Women's Open -- but arrived in Australia with a new attitude, she said. ""I didn't play well last week but I came into this week with a new mindset, I worked on a few things and everything just kind of clicked. ""It worked out really well, after the first round I knew I could win, so from then on that was the goal.""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan politician Abdullah Abdullah withdrew Sunday from the upcoming runoff election, saying he believes that the second round would be as fraudulent as the first. ""I want this to be an example for the future so that no one again tries to use fraud to abuse the rights of the Afghan people,"" Abdullah said. Abdullah's withdrawal was not expected to change plans for the November 7 runoff election and ensures the re-election of President Hamid Karzai if the voting proceeds as scheduled. Azizullah Lodin, the president of Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission, said Sunday that an announcement on holding the runoff would be made Monday. In a statement, Karzai's campaign spokesman said the president would respect whatever decision the commission's makes about whether to hold the election. Karzai initially had claimed victory after the first ballot in August, but a U.N.-backed panel of election monitors threw out nearly a third of his votes, citing fraud. When that left Karzai short of a majority, he agreed to the runoff, set for Saturday. Abdullah had called for the resignations of top election officials and politicians to avert electoral fraud in the runoff. He argued that the commissioners, who are hired by Karzai, cannot be impartial. But that request was not met, he said Sunday, and he did not believe that a transparent election was possible. ""I spoke to Karzai about the Independent Election Commission abusing its powers, but he denied it and refused to dismiss them,"" he said. The election commission, which denied any wrongdoing, slammed the candidate's accusations. Unless Abdullah has proof of such bias, he is in no position to ask any Afghan official to step down, Lodin said. In a statement Sunday, the U.S. Embassy said ""the United States remains committed to supporting the Afghan people in carrying out a constitutional electoral process."" ""The United States looks forward to working with the next Afghan administration and with the Afghan people and our partners in the international community to support Afghanistan's progress towards peace and stability,"" the embassy statement said. Also Sunday, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said ""the next step must be to bring this electoral process to a conclusion in a legal and timely manner."" In a statement, a representative for the U.N. group credited Abdullah with having ""acted in a statesmanlike and dignified way and put forward a number of constructive proposals for reform which I hope will be part of the political agenda for Afghanistan's future."" British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said in a statement that he was ""confident that Afghanistan's leaders will support the remaining steps of the democratic process."" ""We hope to see an Afghan government emerge that responds to the will of the people, that reaches out to all parts of Afghan society and that is ready to take strong action to meet the challenges that Afghanistan faces,"" Brown's statement said. ""We are ready to work in close partnership with such a government."" Abdullah did not address any plans to be part of a possible coalition government, but he did not rule it out either. ""I will not focus on that,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Sunday, adding that his goal was to contribute to a better Afghanistan in whatever capacity he found himself. He urged his supporters to remain calm and not take to the streets in protest. ""I will be available to serve this country,"" he said. ""I am in consultations with my followers. ... A movement for change will be there, and I will lead that movement."" A spokesman for Karzai said it was ""very unfortunate"" that Abdullah had decided to boycott the runoff. However, the vote should be held anyway, for the sake of Afghans, Waheed Omar said. ""The process has to continue. ... The people of Afghanistan have to be given the right to vote,"" Omar said. Abdullah rejected any assertion that his withdrawal meant people should boycott the vote. ""Absolutely not,"" he said. ""I will not infringe into the rights of our citizens. This is my decision, and the people of Afghanistan will judge it for themselves and make decisions for themselves."" He also said he opposed any violence from his supporters, adding that he ""called upon them to stay calm, patient."" Asked about how Karzai can plan to go ahead with a one-person runoff, Abdullah responded, ""You can ask him."" ""But I'm not getting into the legal implications and constitutional implications of my decision,"" Abdullah said. Zalmay Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, predicted last week in an interview to air at 2 p.m. ET Sunday on CNN's ""Amanpour"" that Abdullah would quit the race. ""First, he doesn't have much money left,"" he said. ""Second, I think that he thinks that given the situation, he's likely to lose, and maybe he'll get less votes than he did in the first round, so that would be embarrassing."" At a news conference in Jerusalem on Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the legitimacy of the race would not be affected in the event of Abdullah's withdrawal. On Sunday, Clinton said in a statement, ""We hope that [Abdullah] will continue to stay engaged in the national dialogue and work on behalf of the security and prosperity of the people of Afghanistan."" ""It is now a matter for the Afghan authorities to decide on a way ahead that brings this electoral process to a conclusion in line with the Afghan constitution,"" Clinton's statement added. ""We will support the next president and the people of Afghanistan, who seek and deserve a better future."" Abdullah's announcement comes after Gen. Stanley McChrystal, commander of forces in Afghanistan, has asked for additional troops to fight the Taliban insurgency, which has escalated its violence recently. The militants have vowed to disrupt the election and claimed responsibility for a Wednesday attack that killed five United Nations workers, two of whom were helping with the vote. Nine others were wounded after attackers stormed a guest house in Kabul. In response, the United Nations ordered nonessential personnel out of the country. A record number of U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan in October: at least 58. Abdullah said issues such as security and the possibility of more attacks were factors in his decision. ""This is not in exchange for anything from anybody,"" he said. ""My decision was purely to give the people of Afghanistan a chance to move on."" CNN's Thomas Evans contributed to this report.","Hundreds of thousands of votes were tossed after the August vote .

"Island County, Washington (CNN) -- Colton Harris-Moore returned Thursday to a setting with which he is all-too-acquainted: a Washington State courtroom. After two years on the run, Harris-Moore, 19, heard the charge and possible jail time he faces for stealing a plane. The teen had been on the run since he walked away from a juvenile halfway house in Renton, Washington, in 2008. Harris-Moore has already been charged with over a dozen crimes such as fleeing from police officers in a stolen car, identity thefts, burglaries and taking a four seater Cessna plane for a joyride, even though he doesn't have a pilot's license and never apparently took any flying lessons. The FBI had offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.  At the hearing, Harris-Moore's attorney did not contest his continued detention and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. If a grand jury hands up an indictment in the plane case, Harris-Moore would next appear at an arraignment to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. Before he gained notoriety as the brazen ""barefoot bandit,"" Harris-Moore was a wayward boy who despite frequent run-ins with the law, behavior modifying medication, pleas from relatives and psychological counseling could not stay out of trouble. 'Let down' A CNN review of more than a thousand pages of court documents painted a different picture of the now infamous outlaw. The records instead show Harris-Moore running from his demons and what a psychologist's report called ""a home situation marked by instability, loss and alcohol abuse."" ""He was let down,"" Harris-Moore's aunt Sandra Puttmann told CNN. ""He was neglected by the schools, the police and his immediate family. He didn't have a normal life, he had an alcoholic mom and her boyfriends."" Read the aunt's letter to the court . According to Puttmann, her sister drank heavily and regularly broke Harris-Moore's toys as a form of punishment while he was growing up. In court records, Harris-Moore tells a psychologist his mother acted ""mean"" when drinking and ""she will break my things. She yells and screams at me."" Harris-Moore's mother, Pamela Kohler, did not respond to CNN's calls, emails and a letter asking for comment on the allegations. A homemade placard placed on the driveway to the broken down trailer where she lives and where Colton Harris-Moore grew up warned visitors, ""If you go past this sign you will be shot."" ""She never abused Colton,"" said O. Yale Lewis, Kohler's entertainment attorney who is fielding offers for books and movies based on Harris-Moore's alleged escapades. ""There is a much richer story here."" Many disappointments . But in a handwritten letter in Harris-Moore's court file, Kohler wrote, ""This boy has had many disappointments all his life. His step father died and our dog and this had severe effects on Colt and I."" ""He does things,"" Kohler's letter continues. ""Without thinking of the end results."" According to court records, Kohler said Colton's father left when he was ""four to five years old."" Colton was ""attached to"" her next husband, Kohler said in court records, but he was ""a heroin addict"" who died of undetermined causes when Colton was 10 years old. Read the full letter . A subsequent live-in boyfriend, is described by Kohler in court records, as, ""not playing with a full deck."" State Child Protective Services responded to reports of incidents at the home on 12 different occasions, once removing Harris-Moore from his mother's care for three days, court records show. In a May 2003 incident, court records say that Colton Harris-Moore, then 12, called 911 after his father allegedly pushed him to the ground and gripped his hand around the boy's throat. When police arrived, according to the records, Colton's father Gordon Moore ""ran into the woods... but they soon caught him. He was arrested and taken to jail."" Soon after, court records detail, Gordon Moore cut off contact with the family. CNN was unable to reach him for comment about the incident. According to court records, Pamela Kohler blamed her son for the incident. ""His mom was drunk and screaming at him,' Island County court records said. ""She stumbled around asking, 'What are you going to do now? They have taken your father away.' "" Six months later, Harris-Moore was arrested with three other boys for breaking into the middle school he attended. Harris-Moore later pleaded guilty to using a butane torch lighter to burn a hole into a school window and then take a laptop and blank CDs. He was sentenced to six months of supervision and 56 hours of community service. Tumultuous relationship . In a 2004 report, Harris-Moore's probation officer wrote, ""Colton and his mother share a tumultuous relationship. Colton's mother reported to me how he is violent at home on a near daily basis. He recently broke the telephone in order to prevent her from calling the police. She then showed me a mark on her forearm of how (sic) he had bit her"" and ""reported a recent incident where Colton went after her with a boat oar."" The same report continued, ""His mother reported how Colton is now medicated and is complying with taking his medications and his behavior has not been as hostile toward her."" In 2007 as her son faced sentencing on burglary charges, Harris-Moore's mother wrote the court, saying ""Colt has had mental problems since about age 2. I have tried for years to get help for him."" ""Colton tended to beat his head on the wall when he was toddler."" Kohler stated, according to court records. In the 2007 psychological evaluation that is part of Harris-Moore's court file, Dr. Delton Young writes ""Colton has a long-term history of psychiatric and behavioral difficulties. He also has been prescribed a wide range of psychiatric medications including anti-depressants, stimulant medications, mood stabilizers, and even an anti-psychotic medication."" Read the full psychological evaluation . Harris-Moore's then-attorney Rachel Miyoshi said she ordered the psychological review to show that he ""wasn't dangerous, wasn't violent. All the charges against him were basically property crimes,"" she said. Miyoshi remembered Harris-Moore as being ""very on the ball"" and ""courteous."" ""Colton is incredibly bright,"" Miyoshi told CNN. ""But he didn't have much schooling and he wanted to fly. He wasn't going to be able to go into the Navy so I think [allegedly stealing airplanes] was the only avenue for him to do what he wanted."" With Harris-Moore facing 23 charges, Miyoshi negotiated a deal where Harris-Moore plead guilty to three charges of burglary and was sentenced to three years in a juvenile detention home ""I love that boy like one of my own kids,"" Harris-Moore's aunt Sandra Puttmann wrote, the judge in the case. She offered to let him live on her farm with ""horses dogs, cats, chickens that he shows a big interest in. I think he got mixed in with the wrong crowd and got himself in to (sic) far."" But in April 2008, Harris-Moore allegedly snuck out of the group home for juvenile offenders, beginning the chase with authorities that concluded two years later in the Bahamas with the teenage fugitive newly famous and in chains. Sandra Puttmann said Harris-Moore's story could have turned out differently had he gone to live on her farm. Instead, Puttmann said, she would receive phone calls from Harris-Moore every month or so to let her know he was doing ok and still running. Puttmann said she pleaded with the young fugitive to turn himself in. His reply was always the same, ""He wasn't ready to stop yet,"" she said.","Court records show Colton Harris-Moore as a wayward boy with frequent run-ins with the law .

"(CNN) -- I have suffered from debilitating panic attacks since 1986. They were brought on by what happened on January 10, when I was a young reporter at WIS-TV in Columbia, South Carolina, and witnessed the electric chair execution of a convicted killer. I volunteered for the assignment. It was an important case. James Terry Roach was 17 when he committed the crime -- borderline mentally disabled, with a degenerative brain disorder. Authorities had every reason to commute his sentence. Former President Jimmy Carter and Mother Teresa sent in pleas on his behalf -- but to no avail. On the morning of the 10th, Roach was strapped into the electric chair and the switch thrown. His body slammed into the back of the chair and instantly tensed up. For one solid minute, electricity coursed through his body. Executioners paused for one minute, then once again threw the switch. For 60 more seconds his body absorbed electricity. A short time later, he was pronounced dead. A lot of reporters probably could have distanced themselves emotionally and moved on. But something happened to me in those few minutes. Afterward, I was anxious, couldn't sleep, and found myself reliving the execution over and over in my mind. I came back to work after a couple of days off. The assignment desk had planned to take it easy on me, but as luck would have it, there was some kind of fatal accident, and I was sent on the story. A large garbage truck was picking up a dumpster and accidentally made contact with power lines. So, my first story back was another electrocution. Heading back to the station I had my first panic attack. People have told me, ""I get panic-stricken, and nervous too. It happens."" But getting nervous is not a panic attack. An attack makes you feel as if your world is ending. Your heart is racing, you begin to hyperventilate, every nerve in your body is exploding -- it seems you're about to die, and you have an overwhelming sense of doom. Opinion: Why do we keep executing people? My initial reaction to a panic attack was to find something to drink -- beer, wine, anything to calm down after work. But eventually I had to make a deal with myself: No drinking to help ""take the edge off."" If I was going to drink, it would be when I felt good -- pounding a few back to ease anxiety would lead me down a road I didn't want to take. In the late '80s and early '90s panic attacks came on to one degree or another almost daily, and of course the deal with myself was violated all too often. I sought help, and was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I was embarrassed and humiliated, but kept it to myself. For years it was very difficult. Instead of getting better, it seemed to be getting worse. I withdrew, and couldn't be by myself without thinking the panic attacks would send me -- in my term -- ""cycling out of control."" I remember taking a writing test at CNN in 1989 and having three punishing panic attacks that were so bad I almost got up and walked out of the building. Professional support made things get better, but the attacks never completely went away. Certain situations and environments could take me back and an attack would come on, my heart feeling as though it would burst through my chest, worried that I would just collapse on the ground gasping for breath while sweat was trickling down the side of my face. OK, now imagine that happening while you're getting ready to do an on-camera interview, or tethered to a live shot, or the very worst -- sitting in the anchor chair. It wasn't just happening to me, it was happening to me in front of millions of people. I have been a journalist a long time. Along the way I have picked up what I consider a nice collection of awards and honors, and reported on everything imaginable: hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, fires, wars, elections, you name it. I am proud of that work, but still feel a huge sense of failure every time I let panic attacks get the best of me. It is hard to describe a panic attack to someone who hasn't lived through it. As well as an overwhelming sense of dread, a physical weight is on your shoulders -- as if something terrible is going to happen. But my colleagues never seemed to know anything was wrong. If I couldn't concentrate, or felt like I couldn't get through a live shot I would sometimes say, ""Ugh, I don't feel good. I didn't sleep well last night."" It was all very believable. Once, I was anchoring a live environment show on CNN on a weekend morning. When I started to read the headlines, I was hyperventilating and couldn't make a sound. People at home were seeing video of what I was supposed to be talking about. I reached down, took a drink of water and told the producer I was just choking for a second. The hour show went off without a hitch from there on. I have flown nearly a million miles on Delta Airlines alone, and on nearly every flight I worried about a panic attack, and on a few of them, suffered through the full-blown thing. One time a flight attendant walked down the aisle and asked me if I needed oxygen. The sheer ridiculousness of the whole episode made me laugh and the panic passed, like it always does. What I went through is nothing compared with troops returning home from war zones struggling with PTSD, and my heart goes out to them. I am healthy, happy where I am in life, and have been blessed with great jobs and great friends. I am still reporting, anchoring and doing live shots. If you tune in, you won't see me collapse in a fit of panic. I am doing a lot better. More than once in my life, I thought there was no way to get through this. I vividly remember being on a warm, sunny beach in the throes of a panic attack and wondering if my life would ever be normal again -- if I would ever again simply be able to close my eyes and be at ease. For those going through anxiety issues, I have a message: You can get better, you can work through it. It may be therapy, medication, or just the realization that you aren't alone. I kept a journal during the worst period of my panic attacks which helps me to remember how far I've come since my darkest hours -- when I felt as though the sun would never come up again. It isn't easy to write about this. A big part of me still considers myself a failure for having to cope with this condition.

"(Rolling Stone) -- Relax, you legions of Hunger Gamers. We have a winner. Hollywood didn't screw up the film version of Suzanne Collins' young-adult bestseller about a survival-of-the-fittest reality show that sends home all its teen contestants, save the victor, in body bags. The screen ""Hunger Games"" radiates a hot, jumpy energy that's irresistible. It has epic spectacle, yearning romance, suspense that won't quit and a shining star in Jennifer Lawrence, who gives us a female warrior worth cheering. That's more than you can say for the castration job that the suits did on Stephenie Meyer's ""Twilight"" franchise. I'll admit that ""Games"" isn't the scary, eruptive firecracker of my dark, Tarantino-fueled imagination. And if you're among the 26 million who devoured the Collins trilogy -- ""The Hunger Games"" followed by ""Catching Fire"" and ""Mockingjay"" -- you know it could have been. But even wearing a PG-13 harness to ensure profitability, ""The Hunger Games"" gets your pulse racing. It's about something pertinent, the mission to define yourself in a world that's spinning off its moral axis. As 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, the renegade hunter who kills with a bow and arrow and stands up to take the place of her younger sister in the deadly Games, Lawrence reveals a physical and emotional grace that's astonishing. Give her the deed, because she owns this movie. It's not just that Katniss makes ""Twilight's"" Bella Swan look like the wimp she is, it's that Lawrence, 21, is an acting dynamo with the skills to let us into Katniss' searching mind. Last year, Lawrence won an Oscar nomination for playing an Ozark girl in ""Winter's Bone."" She's just as affecting this time, lending primal force to this dystopian fable of a society out of sync with human values. At 142 minutes, ""The Hunger Games"" can go from rushed to draggy. But director Gary Ross (""Pleasantville,"" ""Seabiscuit"") hits the high spots, using action to define character instead of obliterate it. He wisely brought in Collins to collaborate on the script he wrote with Billy Ray (""Shattered Glass""). That way, even when the book's events are condensed or characters eliminated, the feeling stays true. ""The Games"" are a punishment invented by the Capitol of Panem (read: North America) for the 12 districts whose rebellion against Capitol rule was crushed more than 74 years ago. The attitude of President Snow (Donald Sutherland, wily in his evil) is ""You screwed us, so we'll screw you."" Every year on Reaping Day, a boy and a girl (ages 12 to 18) from each district are chosen by lottery to fight to the death in a televised gladiator event devised by head Games-maker Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley). Ratings are not a problem. Even in downtrodden District 12, where Katniss hunts for scraps to feed her sister and her widowed mother, viewing the Games is mandatory. You won't need your arm twisted to see the movie, artfully shot by Tom Stern (""Mystic River"") as the scene shifts from the perverse lushness of the Capitol to the stark landscape of the battle zone. And did I mention makeovers? All the Tributes (that's what contenders are called) get them. Katniss has fashion genius Cinna (Lenny Kravitz doing a fun spin on Tom Ford) to create a wow dress that bursts into flame at the hem. Nice one. Like Bella before her, Katniss is pursued by two laddies-in-waiting, in this case Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), the strapping District 12 hunk and fellow illegal hunter she leaves behind, and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the baker's son who joins Katniss in the Games and secretly pines for her. Are you Team Gale or Team Peeta? You might not care as much, since neither has the exotic allure of a vampire or a wolf. But Hemsworth (""The Last Song,"" with girlfriend Miley Cyrus) quickly establishes a strong, appealing presence. And Hutcherson (""The Kids Are All Right"") brings humor and a bruised heart to a boy who needs to mature fast. Dynamite actors dot the film. Stanley Tucci is a brilliant blend of mirth and malice as Caesar Flickerman, a TV host who reps the dark side of Ryan Seacrest in this lethal version of ""American Idol."" Elizabeth Banks brings malicious wit to the bewigged and powdered PR guru Effie Trinket. ""May the odds be ever in your favor,"" announces Effie with inane sincerity. And the reliably stellar Woody Harrelson cuts deep as the perpetually s***faced Haymitch Abernathy, a former victor in the Games now acting as mentor to both Katniss and Peeta. When he's not falling-down drunk, Haymitch instructs his protÃ©gÃ©s on how to suck up to sponsors who send supplies into the arena when a Tribute wins audience favor. So-called reality TV is given a sharp, satirical kick as Tributes learn to play and pander to hidden cameras. Is Katniss really falling for Peeta as she nurses his wounds, or is she faking it to save her a** and his? Discuss. Sadly, the erotic heat that Collins generates between Katniss and Peeta in a hidden cave never rises above room temperature onscreen. Hand-to-hand combat does fuel the intensity as Katniss fights career Tributes trained to go medieval on enemy ass. Check out machete-wielding Cato (Alexander Ludwig) and knife-throwing Clove (Isabelle Fuhrman), not to mention a swarm of deadly, genetically engineered wasps called Tracker Jackers. The caring bond Katniss forms with Rue (Amandla Stenberg), the youngest Tribute, is just a brief break from the assaults aimed to make Katniss trade her soul for survival. For all its compromises, ""The Hunger Games"" is a zeitgeist movie that captures the spirit of a soul-sucking age in which ego easily trumps common cause. Ironically, the kill-to-win ethos that dominates movies from 1987's prophetic ""The Running Man"" to the undiluted brutality of Japan's ""Battle Royale"" in 2000, may find its largest viewership in ""The Hunger Games."" But will mainstream audiences respond to the moral challenge churning under the pop-culture razzle-dazzle? It's anybody's guess. My advice is to keep your eyes on Lawrence, who turns the movie into a victory by presenting a heroine propelled by principle instead of hooking up with the cutest boy. That's what makes Katniss revolutionary. May the odds be ever in her favor. See the full article at RollingStone.com.

"(CNN) -- There are not many Bond villains who survive to tell the tale of their encounter with 007. Sebastien Foucan is neither shaken nor stirred, although that's more than can be said for his character ""Mollaka"" -- who was blown to smithereens by Daniel Craig in the 2006 epic ""Casino Royale."" Foucan has proved even more elusive than the acrobatic bomb-maker he portrayed in the villages of Madagascar, where he vaulted through jungle and a construction site, leaping perilously off buildings and cranes. Rather than ""Die Another Day,"" the career of Foucan -- known as the founder of free running and a developer of its close relative Parkour -- has taken off in a way he never dreamed of. ""Being in the James Bond movie was just amazing,"" the Frenchman tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""It was fantastic working on a big stage, fighting James Bond and having the helicopter shoot everything. ""Knowing that I've never done any acting, I didn't plan to be in a movie like this. It was just fantastic. ""For the discipline, I think it was a big platform and I think it just made free running bigger and bigger. ""It keeps growing. I worked with Madonna on her 'Confession' tour and my life changed at this point because I went from being a free runner, an ambassador, to something even bigger."" Foucan has come a long way since running around Paris as a teenager with the likes of Parkour founder David Belle. Parkour -- which is taken from the French word ""parcours"" meaning ""route"" or ""course"" -- consists of being able to ""move freely over and through any terrain using only the abilities of the body, principally through running, jumping, climbing and quadrupedal movement."" Foucan, while a keen student of Parkour in his teens, believed that the discipline was far too narrow and lacked a spiritual aspect. Instead, he created a fusion of the art -- taking Parkour and a new philosophical approach to bring about free running. ""It's a lifestyle,"" he says. ""There is no beginning, no middle and no end. It is part of my life. ""It's like a bird. When a bird wakes up, it's a bird, it's flying, and for me it's exactly the same thing. ""It's when I wake up, I am free running; when I'm sitting, I'm still free running. When I talk to you, I'm thinking about free running. It's part of me now, it's like walking."" In 2003, Foucan finally decided to break away from Parkour after performing in London, where he now resides. His belief that ""all the world is a playground"" gives him a feeling of freedom which he treasures. ""Parkour at the beginning was very one-dimensional,"" he says. ""It was very A to B, 'we shouldn't do this, we shouldn't do that,' which doesn't work for me as an artist. ""I really feel like I want to express myself. I don't want to have any limitations. ""Free running is known as using the environment and expressing yourself -- which means you can do anything you feel. It's part of you. ""You can do flips, tricks, swing, anything which is creative and feels beautiful -- it's more my way. It's freedom of expression for me."" While most of us would simply walk around our city or neighborhood by using the sidewalk, such an idea is almost alien to Foucan. If there is a slope to slide down or a wall to run up, then he needs no invitation to perform some of the moves witnessed in that breathless sequence where he runs from Bond. ""As soon as I get outside, my mindset turns to free running,"" he explains. ""I use the whole environment and instead of just following a straight path, I do my own way of going outside. ""If it's just to jump, to perform, you have to be really focused on what you're going to do, where you're going to put your step, on your technique also because the surface is completely different. ""It can be metal, it can be concrete and there are so many elements -- sometimes you can have also people coming and walking past. ""You need to pay attention and that's what you're thinking about before you do a single move."" The expertise to be able to pull off the stunts which Foucan does comes after 20 years of training -- five to seven hours a day. Those who want to apply need only a high level of flexibility, excellent spacial awareness, unparalleled sense of balance and the ability of Spiderman when it comes to jumping and climbing. Yes, even those who suffer from acrophobia -- a fear of heights -- can have a go, says Foucan, who has coped with the problem since his childhood. While his background is in track and field, Foucan is a keen rock climber, plays football and ice skates -- even appearing in a British TV show, ""Dancing on Ice."" All these skills garnered from different sports help to provide new inspiration and ideas for his free running. ""Each time I look at the city, I start to see how functional it can be,"" he said. ""It's normal to walk down the stairs, to go to a different place, but for a practitioner from Parkour to free running, it is important for us to see how functional the environment is . ""For example, a slope can be something you can slide down and feel your balance. Stairs -- you can see how many times you can bounce down them. ""We have also got a technique that we call 'tick tack' where you use the wall to the side. ""The environment is like a computer game where you see a ghost of yourself. You picture a line or a route and you think to yourself, 'Can I do this path?' That is how I see the environment."" Free running has become more and more popular in recent years, with Fourcan setting up his own academy. His expertise and advice is invaluable to those fellow thrillseekers who fuel their escapism through adrenaline. But as Fourcan confirms, free running does come with a health warning. ""It is a very risky discipline,"" he says. ""If you don't know what you are doing then you can hurt yourself and even die. ""Fear and risk is a perception and if you do something without knowing what you're doing, you're going to be in trouble, you're going to hurt yourself. ""There is danger everywhere. Whether you're taking the car, the plane, whether you are Olympic athlete, there is risk and you can hurt yourself. ""People need to know everything required -- dedication and a lot of practice."" Now 39, you might expect Foucan to be contemplating retirement from such an extreme sport. That option is not even a consideration at this moment in time -- if ever. ""I see myself even more than an athlete,"" he says. ""I would see myself as an ultimate athlete. ""In a sense, I'm closer to an animal, to my inner nature. There is no end of my career; you don't have a point where you go, 'Oh, now you're 29 or 30 years old and now you're finished.' ""It doesn't work like this for me. It will be forever, I will practice this forever until I die.""","Sebastien Foucan is one of the most successful free runners in the world .

"(CNN) -- Nearly six years after he escaped from prison, one of the U.S. Marshals Service's 15 Most Wanted fugitives has been extradited from Mexico and returned to that same prison, according to the federal agency. Convicted child killer Edward Salas was serving time for murder when he escaped from the Curry County Detention Center in Clovis, New Mexico, in 2008. At the time of his escape, Salas was serving a life sentence plus 56 years for his role in the murder of a 10-year-old boy, the Marshals Service said in a press release issued Saturday. Mexican authorities arrested Salas in October 2012 on a U.S. provisional arrest request. The Marshals Service worked closely with the Curry County District Attorney's office, Mexican authorities and the Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs, which resulted in Salas' return to Curry County on Saturday, according to the release. In 2005 Salas, with two of his brothers and two other people, planned to murder a teen named Ruben Perez in his home, reportedly in retaliation for an argument at Clovis High School. Instead, they killed the teen's brother, Carlos Perez, who was sleeping in the same bedroom. Carlos Perez died the day before his 11th birthday, the Marshals Service said.","Edward Salas was convicted for his role in the 2005 murder of a 10-year-old in New Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Parishioners at a Lakeland, Florida, church tackled a gunman who allegedly shot the pastor and associate pastor on Sunday, holding the suspect until police arrived, the Polk County Sheriff's Office said. Jeremiah Fogel, 57, was taken into custody following the incident at the Greater Faith Christian Church, the sheriff's office said in a statement.  Fogel is also suspected of shooting and killing his wife at their residence before going to the church, police said. Fogel walked to the front of the church during a prayer meeting between the morning services and specifically opened fire on church clergy, said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. ""Pastor William Boss was shot once in the head,"" Judd said.  ""At that time everyone jumped up, and he went over to the left side of the church and shot the assistant minister Carl Stewart three times."" After Fogel opened fire, parishioners Derek Foster and Corey Reid grabbed the gun from him, hit him in the head with a nightstand and held him to the ground, according to Judd. Boss and Stewart were being treated at Lakeland Regional Medical Center. Judd said police are trying to determine a motive behind the shooting. ""Obviously there was a conflict with his wife and/or some people in church,"" Judd said. ""We're trying to find out exactly what forced him to go into his killing rage on a Sunday morning.""

This brings to eight the number of people who entered Dubai with British passports to allegedly take part in the killing of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founding member of the military wing of the Palestinian Islamist movement. The development is likely to deepen concerns over how the killers acquired the passports a day after the European Union condemned what it said were brazen cases of identity theft.

"(CNN) -- First of all, of course we'd rather see more original blockbusters created with female leads in mind.

"(CNN) -- A powerful earthquake struck southern Iran on Tuesday, killing at least 37 people but apparently sparing the nearby Bushehr nuclear plant from any damage, Iranian state-run media reported. At least 850 people were injured, Iran's Press TV said. The magnitude-6.3 quake was centered about 100 kilometers (63 miles) southeast of the plant, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Press TV, citing Bushehr's governor, said the single-reactor facility was undamaged. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran had informed it of the earthquake and said that there was no damage or radioactive release at the facility. The state-run IRNA news agency cited a plant executive as saying the facility's distance from the epicenter was the reason for the lack of damage. However, the quake ""ruined"" the city of Kaki, which is near the epicenter, the state-run IRNA news agency said. Interactive map: World's biggest earthquakes since 1900 . The cities of Kormouj, Dayer and Kangan and the villages of Shanbe and Sana were also seriously damaged, IRNA reported. State media also reported landslides that had destroyed buildings and crowds gathering in towns seeking help, Reuters said. The Iranian Red Crescent Society sent five assessment teams to coordinate rescue operations, IRNA reported, saying ambulances were sent from Tehran to assist in the rescue effort. The semi-official Fars news agency said helicopters also have been sent to help. At least three strong aftershocks struck the same area in the hour after the quake Tuesday, according to the USGS, and Press TV said authorities expect the number of casualties to rise. The earthquake could be felt across the Persian Gulf in Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, where some buildings in Abu Dhabi were evacuated and some businesses sent their employees home for the day. It was not immediately clear whether the Bushehr plant was continuing to operate in the wake of the earthquake. Iran began construction on the plant in 1975, before the country's Islamic revolution. Russia stepped in during the 1990s to finish construction of the plant, which the IAEA says first connected to Iran's electrical grid in 2011. Interactive: Measuring the magnitude of earthquakes .

"(CNN) -- A court in Jordan acquitted radical preacher Abu Qatada of charges of plotting to bomb millennium celebrations in Jordan in 2000, semi-state owned newspaper Addustour reported Wednesday. The court ordered his immediate release if no other cases are raised against him, the newspaper said. Qatada, whose real name is Omar Othman, was cleared in July of charges of conspiracy to bomb a U.S. school in Jordan in the late 1990s, state media reported. The cleric was deported from the United Kingdom last year, ending a years-long legal battle to force him to leave the country. A Jordanian national, he was wanted in his home country, where he had been convicted in absentia on two charges of conspiracy to cause explosions. Britain had been trying to deport him since 2001, but his legal appeals kept him there until last year. Home Office: He's not coming back . Following the news of his acquittal, a Home Office spokesman told CNN that Abu Qatada would not be returning to Britain. ""Abu Qatada's retrial in Jordan was made possible thanks to this government's determination to successfully deport him from the UK to face the courts in his own country,"" he said. ""It is right that the due process of law has taken place in Jordan. The UK courts agreed that Abu Qatada posed a threat to national security in the UK, so we are pleased that we were able to remove him. ""Abu Qatada remains subject to a deportation order and a United Nations travel ban. He is not coming back to the UK."" Torture fears . In January 2012, the European Court of Human Rights blocked Britain from sending him to Jordan over fears that evidence obtained by torture could be used against him at trial. British authorities said he raised funds for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and publicly supported militants' violent activities. Videos of his preaching were found in a German apartment used by some of those involved in the 9/11 attacks on the United States, including ringleader Mohammed Atta. Abu Qatada had denied the allegations against him. He arrived in the UK in 1993 and applied for asylum on the grounds that he had been tortured by Jordanian authorities. He came to Britain on a forged United Arab Emirates passport, according to court documents, and claimed asylum for himself, his wife and their three children.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Georgia's parole board heard a last-minute appeal Monday by Troy Davis, who is set to die by lethal injection for the murder 22 years ago of a Savannah police officer. Members of victim Mark MacPhail's family also appeared at the parole board hearing to describe their loss, saying afterward they felt the panel listened to what they had to say. A jury convicted Davis of murder in 1991, paving the way for his execution, which has been delayed three times and is now scheduled for 7 p.m. Wednesday at a state prison in Jackson, Georgia. In a statement, the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles said it would not reach a decision in the case until Tuesday at the earliest. Options for the board include commuting a death sentence to either life without parole or life with the possibility of parole, or denying clemency -- which, in this case, would clear the way for Davis' execution. The panel also can delay the execution to continue its consideration of the case. MacPhail, a police officer, died in 1989 after being shot three times. Since Davis' 1991 conviction, seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted or contradicted their testimony. There also have been questions about the physical evidence -- and, according to some, the lack thereof -- linking Davis to the killing. ""We believe that we've established substantial doubt in this case,"" said Stephen Marsh, the defense attorney for Davis. "" And given the level of doubt that exists in this case, we believe that an execution is simply not appropriate."" A small group of Davis' supporters protested outside the building where Monday's meeting took place. A banner saying ""Free Troy Davis Now"" was hung nearby, and several protesters carried signs. On Sunday, Amnesty International, the NAACP and Georgians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty asked people to join them Monday for prayers, musical performances and speeches outside the building. According to these groups, there have been about 300 rallies, vigils and events worldwide in the past week or so. In addition, they say that more than 1 million people have signed a petition in support of Davis' bid to be exonerated. But Joan MacPhail, the victim's widow, said after the hearing that those protesting against the execution don't understand the facts of the case. ""We have lived this for 22 years. We know what the truth is,"" she told reporters. ""And for someone to ludicrously say that he is a victim -- We are victims. Look at us. We have put up with this stuff for 22 years. It's time for justice. We need our justice."" In a 2008 statement, then-Chatham County District Attorney Spencer Lawton described how Davis was at a pool party in Savannah when he shot another man, Michael Cooper, wounding him in the face. Davis was then driven to a nearby convenience store, where he pistol-whipped a homeless man, Larry Young, who'd just bought a beer. Soon thereafter, prosecutors said, MacPhail -- who was working in uniform, off-duty, at a nearby bus station and restaurant -- arrived. It was then, the jury determined, that Davis shot the officer three times, including once in the face as he stood over him. Davis' lawyers, in a federal court filing, insisted that there is ""no physical evidence linking"" Davis to MacPhail's murder. They point, too, to ""the unremarkable conclusion"" of a ballistics expert who testified that he could not find definitively that the bullets that wounded Cooper and killed MacPhail were the same. Georgia's attorney general, in an online statement, claimed that the expert said the bullets came from the same gun type and noted that casings at the pool party shooting matched -- thus came from the same firearm as -- those found at MacPhail's murder scene. Two decades ago, a jury convicted Davis on two counts of aggravated assault and one each of possessing a firearm during a crime, obstructing a law enforcement officer and murder. The latter charge led, soon thereafter, to his death sentence. While reviewing Davis' claims of innocence last year, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia found that Davis ""vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence."" ""Some of the evidence is not credible and would be disregarded by a reasonable juror,"" Judge William T. Moore wrote in a 172-page opinion. ""Other evidence that Mr. Davis brought forward is too general to provide anything more than smoke and mirrors."" The odds do not appear to be in Davis' favor. The parole board denied him clemency once before. And the board has never changed its mind on any case in the past 33 years. After Monday's hearing, the victim's mother, Anneliese MacPhail, praised the parole board members for listening to what her family had to say. ""They talked to us. They gave us time that we did not get all of the time,"" she said in reference to previous hearings. ""Sometimes we were rushed out of there in 30 minutes and we felt really rejected, you know, hurtful. This time, I think, was really, really good. And I feel confident. That sounds awful, but that's the way I feel."" Choking back tears, MacPhail's daughter, Madison, said she told the panel that ""the future that we would have had together was taken from us. The future he could have had with this family was taken."" Meanwhile, the Rev. Raphael Gamaliel Warnock, who also testified Monday, said before the hearing that he believes ""there is too much doubt in this case for an execution."" ""I have met with (Davis) on death row,"" Warnock said. ""I believe he is innocent."" -- CNN's John Murgatroyd contributed to this report.","NEW: Victim's family tells parole board about their loss .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Taliban claimed responsibility Monday for two explosions targeting a government building in Pakistan's tribal region, a Taliban leader said. The blasts killed 50 people and injured at least 70 others, according to Shamas Ul Islam, a senior government official in Mohmand Agency. Umar Khalid, head of the Pakistani Taliban in Mohmand Agency, said pamphlets had been distributed in the area 20 days ago warning members of peace committees or Lashkars (tribal militias) to abandon any efforts to join the government in fighting militants or face ""consequences."" ""We will continue to attack all pro-government officials and their supporters who try to join any peace committees or Lashkars,"" Khalid said. The blasts occurred as government officials were about to meet with members of a volunteer militia group established to fight militants in the area, said Maqsood Amin, another senior government official in Mohmand Agency. Among those killed in the blasts was Haji Kachkol Khan, a senior leader of the peace committeee, Islam said. Amin said two suicide bombers were responsible for the blasts. One detonated inside the building and another outside the building's gate, he said. The explosions occurred in the agency's headquarters of Ghalanai, Pakistan. A curfew has been imposed in Ghalanai as a preventive measure, Islam said. The victims were taken to a local hospital after the blast, said Mohammad Zafar, a senior medical officer. Monday's attacks were not the first time anti-Taliban and pro-government militias have been targeted in Pakistan. The attacks have been increasing over the past year, but Monday's was one of the deadliest attacks this year. A November 5 suicide attack targeting a mosque in Dera Adam Khel, where locals had formed an anti-Taliban militia, killed 67 people. In July, another suicide attack killed more than 100 people, also in Mohmand Agency. Mohmand is one of seven semi-autonomous tribal agencies along the 1,500-mile border that Pakistan shares with Afghanistan. The Pakistani military has been battling insurgents in the area for some time. The attacks underscore that when locals decide to take a stand against the Taliban, there are sometimes deadly consequences. The Taliban usually warns locals against taking such actions, as they did in Monday's attacks. The Pakistani government has said that such suicide attacks are a sign that the Taliban is growing desperate and becoming more aware that Pakistanis are taking a stand against them. In a statement, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan condemned the attacks. ""While details of these suicide attacks are still being verified, it is clear this vicious crime killed and wounded many innocent people,"" the statement said. ""Our thoughts and sympathies are with the individuals and families affected by these inhumane acts.""

"(CNN) -- If you think you've heard it all, follow this tale of a hungry black bear who went for a ride, literally. Douglas County, Colorado, Sheriff's deputies early Friday got a call about a honking car and a commotion inside. Perhaps it was teenagers or a thief, they thought as they approached Ralph Story's 2008 Toyota Corolla. It turns out it was a thief, albeit the furry variety. The deputies' first clue to something unusual was that the car was 125 feet below its normal parking spot in the driveway of the Storys' Larkspur home, which sits on five acres. Imagine their further surprise when they turned on their flashlights and got a peek inside. It was a full-grown black bear, also known as ursus americanus. The deputies had earlier received a call from a neighbor. She had heard honking and came up to the Story home, where the family was asleep. ""Our Toyota was making a heck of a racket and was rocking back and forth,"" Story said. The neighbor called deputies shortly after 3 a.m., according to spokeswoman Michelle Rademacher of the sheriff's Department in the community 45 miles south of Denver. Story told CNN the bear was probably drawn to a peanut butter sandwich left inside by his 17-year-old son Ben. He said the family didn't realize what was going on until deputies arrived and the neighbor came back and called them. By then the car was no longer in the driveway. Incredulous, Story, his wife and three teen children -- who have lived in Larkspur for 17 years -- rushed outside to see the red Toyota down the hill and near a tree. Somehow, the bear had either opened the unlocked back door or pushed a window down to get inside. Understandably agitated, it bumped into the horn repeatedly and eventually knocked the car's gear into neutral. The Toyota rolled down the hill. The door added to the bear's indignity by closing at some point during the ordeal. A sergeant and two deputies who arrived on the scene ""were stymied on how to proceed,"" Story said. They considered a tranquilizer or shooting the bear, whose gender is unknown. ""Public safety is our primary concern,"" Rademacher said. Finally, the officers decided the best outcome for all would be to keep everyone safe and let the bear live to see more adventures. After taking pictures, one of them tied a long rope to a door handle and pulled. After a few moments, Story said, the bear bounded out around 5 a.m., at least two hours after it had gotten inside. It left a foul-smelling ""present"" on the front seat. The Toyota was trashed, with its air bags, seats and stereo torn to shreds. It's a total loss. Ben Story said he was scared when the family rushed outside to see the car was gone. ""My dad is going to kill me,"" he thought to himself. ""My car is gone. I didn't lock it. He said it was stolen."" Rademacher said deputies have enough experience not to be shocked during a day's work. But this will make for a great memory. Ralph Story admitted the incident was pretty comical. He's glad the animal got away and no one was hurt. ""There's a bear in the car. Who are you gonna get mad at?""","A bear spends more than two hours in a Colorado car .

"(CNN) -- Three men at an apartment, two women outside a sorority and one visitor to a deli were killed in a rampage Friday night in a college community near Santa Barbara, California, authorities said Saturday evening. The two women were identified as Katherine Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, 19, both students at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Christopher Martinez, 20, was killed at the deli, officials said. Elliot Rodger, 22, went on a rampage in Isla Vista, a community near the university and Santa Barbara City College, stabbing three males at his residence and shooting others during a violent spree Friday, Sheriff Bill Brown told reporters. Some of the injured were struck by the suspect's car, authorities said. 7 dead in California shooting rampage . Martinez's father gave a wrenching statement to the news media Saturday afternoon. He was ""a really great kid"" whose ""death has left our family lost and broken,"" Richard Martinez said. ""Our family has a message for every parent out there: You don't think it will happen to your child until it does,"" the visibly emotional parent said, his voice rising to a shout in obvious agony. ""Why did Chris die? Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA. They talk about gun rights, what about Chris' right to live?"" he continued. ""When will this insanity stop?"" he said. ""When will enough people say, stop this madness, we don't have to live like this? Too many have died. We should say to ourselves -- not one more."" Police say the shooter also died. ""It would appear that he took his own life,"" said Brown. 'What a tragic loss' Weiss' Facebook page -- with a banner promoting a sorority event -- was filling with tributes Saturday evening. ""Rest in peace Veronika Weiss. Its not fair that life was taken from you in this manor. My thoughts are with your loved ones,"" wrote one commenter. ""... You were ALWAYS smiling. And I thought you were beautiful.

Weiss was a graduate of Westlake High School in Thousand Oaks, California, according to her Facebook page. Shooter's YouTube video titled 'Retribution' In a YouTube video he posted titled ""Retribution,"" Rodger announced his intent to commit mass murder at a sorority house at UCSB. ""On the day of retribution I'm going to enter the hottest sorority house of UCSB,"" he said. ""I'll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you."" Who's the man behind the rampage? Police said 13 people were injured in the melee -- four by vehicle, eight by gunshot wound, and one of unknown origin. Authorities earlier said seven people were injured. Some of the injured were being treated in a hospital for gunshot wounds or traumatic injuries, including at least one who was in surgery, said sheriff's office spokeswoman Kelly Hoover. Nick Pasichuke, who was hit by Rodger's BMW, suffered two broken legs. ""There was a guy driving a BMW. I was on a longboard (elongated skateboard) and he aimed his car at our group of friends and gunned it into us,"" he said. ""I have two broken legs and need surgery. The police said I flew roughly 50 feet into a busy intersection."" He added, ""This is all so crazy."" Witness: 'She was hysterical' Skylar Serge witnessed one of the shootings from her house. ""I could see a woman on a bike get thrown,"" she said. The woman was bleeding, she added. ""She was hysterical. She was not sure if it was blood running down her leg"" or water from her water bottle. The woman was cared for by an employee from a nearby convenience store who wrapped a belt around her thigh to stop the bleeding, said another witness, Farah Reiz.

"(CNN) -- SOPA appears to be dead. But the battle over Internet piracy is not. In the wake of the debate over the Stop Online Piracy Act, supporters of that now-abandoned bill are looking to Internet service providers for help; they're also taking other tacks that Web-freedom advocates say could have much the same effect as SOPA would have had. That bill, which came before the U.S. Congress earlier this year, would have made it easier to shut down websites that illegally share music, movies and other content. Opponents of SOPA, which included tech heavyweights such as Google, Facebook and Wikipedia, argued it was too broad and could effectively stifle expression online. Remember the Wikipedia blackout? It was in protest of SOPA. But the entire time, Internet service providers, at the behest of trade groups representing the entertainment industry, have been preparing to police such illegal sharing voluntarily and, potentially, shut down sites they think aren't playing by the rules. Those actions could have the same effect that SOPA would have. According to a leading recording industry spokesman, service providers such as Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, Cablevision and Time Warner Cable are expected to begin enforcing ramped-up anti-piracy policies in the next few months. (Time Warner, CNN's parent company, supported the legislation. Time Warner Cable is no longer affiliated with the company.) ""Each ISP has to develop their infrastructure for automating the system,"" Cary Sherman, CEO of the Recording Industry Association of America, said this week at a publishers conference in New York. ""Every ISP has to do it differently, depending on the architecture of its particular network. Some are nearing completion, and others are a little further from completion."" The Copyright Alert System, which the recording industry's trade group first announced in July, has alternately been called a ""gradual elevation"" approach or the ""six strikes"" plan because of the warnings that providers would give before curbing a user's Internet access. Unlike SOPA, it targets individual Web users, not websites. After five or six alerts that their account appears to have been used to download content illegally, the ISP could take measures including temporarily throttling (i.e. dramatically slowing down) Internet speed, redirecting users to a Web page asking them to contact their provider or other measures. Supporters said they expect most Web users will stop downloading copyrighted material once they realize it's not legal. ""We hope that effort -- designed to notify and educate customers, not to penalize them -- will set a reasonable standard for both copyright owners and ISPs to follow, while informing customers about copyright laws and encouraging them to get content from the many legal sources that exist,"" Randal S. Milch, executive vice president of Verizon, said in a statement when the plan was made public last year. Web-freedom advocates acknowledge the plan wouldn't go as far as SOPA, which called for offending websites to be shut down in some cases. But they still have concerns. Mitch Stoltz, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said it's unclear how severe penalties could be for users who are repeatedly warned under the system. The announcement listed examples but made it clear that other means could be used. Most dangerously, he said, the system calls on service providers to act based on accusations or appearances, not proven facts. ""A court hasn't spoken,"" he said. ""It sort of puts the ISPs in the position of being a judge."" No bill is ever truly dead in Congress, but there haven't been any visible efforts to push similar legislation since a public outcry over SOPA led sponsors to shelve the effort in January. ""It is a lot more quiet, and I would guess it's because it's an election year,"" Stoltz said. ""I think they realize this sort of thing can be an election liability now."" But that hasn't stopped anti-piracy proponents from heading to other fronts, including overseas, to continue the fight. Motion Picture Association of America Chairman Chris Dodd, a former U.S. senator, spoke last week in India, where the movie business is huge and is expected to become a $5 billion-a-year industry in the near future. ""Content theft is a global problem, and we must have a global commitment to solving it,"" Dodd said during a film-industry conference in Mumbai. ""This is an important opportunity for the Indian government to move forward with strong protections against online theft. We encourage the Indian film industry to reject as we have, the false argument that you cannot be pro-technology and pro-copyright at the same time."" Dodd's speech came at nearly the same time that an Indian court was ordering all Internet service providers in the country to block 104 websites it said offered illegal music downloads. According to Torrent Freak, a blog specializing in news about file-sharing sites and the legal issues they face, India already has SOPA-style legislation in place that allows judges to make such orders. All the while, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, a treaty designed to define intellectual property rights and enforcement internationally, is moving along, gaining support from many of the world's wealthiest and most influential nations. The United States, the European Union, Japan, Canada and others have already endorsed the deal. ""Few people have heard of ACTA, or the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, but the provisions in the agreement appear quite similar to -- and more expansive than -- anything we saw in SOPA,"" blogger Erik Kain, who is critical of the plan, wrote for Forbes. ""Worse, the agreement spans virtually all of the countries in the developed world, including all of the EU, the United States, Switzerland and Japan."" Opponents said it's not clear how the agreement would affect laws in the United States and elsewhere, while backers said its intent is merely to codify and reinforce existing laws, making them easier to enforce. The treaty is open to all World Trade Organizations to sign until May 2013. It would then need to be ratified by legislative bodies in at least six of the participating nations.","With SOPA stalled in U.S., anti-piracy advocates have taken the fight elsewhere .

"(CNN) -- A major Defense Department contractor has ordered its employees in Iraq to turn in their personal cell phones because ""of a safety and security concern."" KBR says, ""Any individual using a personal cell phone will be disciplined."" Houston, Texas-based KBR Inc., formerly Kellogg Brown & Root, issued a statement saying the company had sent a message with the order to its Iraq employees, but it did not explain the concern that prompted it. ""The matter giving rise to this message is still being reviewed by KBR management, so the company will not provide further comment at this time,"" the statement said. According to an e-mail obtained by CNN, the company issued the order to all KBR employees in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait -- although in its communications with CNN, the company specified only Iraq. In the e-mail, employees are ordered to stop using their cell phones as of 8 a.m. Saturday and turn them in to the company's human resources department. ""Any individual using a personal cell phone will be disciplined,"" the e-mail says. ""Termination is an option of discipline. The cell phone will be confiscated."" According to the e-mail, employees will be given a receipt when they turn in their phones, which will be returned to them ""when the individual departs the site."" Haris Memisevic, the KBR quality manager in Afghanistan who forwarded the e-mail to some employees, said he could not discuss the matter and referred calls to KBR's legal department. A KBR employee, who asked to remain anonymous, said he was ""not aware of any security breaches involving the use of cell phones"" and that employees were not given any reason for the order. He said he has no plans to comply and believes his personal security would be at risk without his cell phone. ""KBR has a communication system, but as with any system it does fail and we can only communicate with another installation by use of the cell phones,"" he said. ""We pay for this use with our own funds."" Some corporate employees have company-provided cell phones, he said, but at his location there is only one company-provided phone for use if the communication system fails. He said the U.S. Army confiscates cell phones from Afghans who work at military installations and returns them when they finish their daily duties. An Army spokesman told CNN on Saturday that the order is strictly a KBR initiative.","Defense contractor KBR Inc. tells workers to turn in personal phones .

"(CNN) -- Sorority sisters. Roommates and a visiting friend. A college student shopping at a deli. These are the six people Elliot Rodger killed in a rampage Friday night near the University of California, Santa Barbara, police said. The violence came to an end when Rodger died, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said. By Monday, the names of all of Rodger's victims had been made public. There has been a call across social media to keep their names in the headlines as much as his, to remember and honor them while interest continues in what might have motivated their killer. Who's the man behind the rampage? The violence began, police said, when Rodger attacked three men who were in his apartment. Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, George Chen, 19, and Weihan Wang, 20, were found stabbed in the home, officials said. Hong and Chen are listed on the lease with Rodger. A law enforcement source said the third victim in the apartment was a visitor, adding that authorities are working on a theory that the attack happened as the men slept. Katherine Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, 19, were later killed outside a sorority, and Christopher Martinez, 20, was killed at a deli, officials said. They were students at UCSB, the school's Chancellor Henry T. Yang said in an online note about the tragedy Sunday. Martinez's father gave a wrenching statement to the news media Saturday afternoon. His son was ""a really great kid"" whose ""death has left our family lost and broken,"" Richard Martinez said. ""Our family has a message for every parent out there: You don't think it will happen to your child until it does,"" the visibly emotional parent said, his voice rising to a shout in obvious agony. ""Why did Chris die? Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the (National Rifle Association). They talk about gun rights -- what about Chris' right to live?"" he continued. ""When will this insanity stop? When will enough people say stop this madness, we don't have to live like this? Too many have died. We should say to ourselves -- not one more."" The comment touched a nerve among many Americans, and it prompted the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence to say the grieving father ""got it exactly right."" ""It is time for the American public to know the truth about why people are dying every day and, thanks to Americans like Mr. Martinez, that truth is starting to be heard,"" Dan Gross said in a statement Sunday. Jeff Dolphin, Christopher Martinez's former roommate, remembered how his friend had always been there for him, the Los Angeles Times reported. A second-year student at UCSB, Dolphin recalled living with Martinez during their freshman year, the newspaper said. ""Chris was just an amazing guy,"" he told the Times. ""If I was going through something, he was always there for me. If I needed something, he was there. If I needed a textbook, if I was locked out of the room because I forgot my key, he would stop playing basketball or doing what he was doing to unlock the door so I didn't have to get charged. He was just a great guy."" Lyssa Hopper, a 19-year-old student, was at the counter of the I.V. Deli Mart, Hopper told the newspaper. When shooting began, Hopper dropped to the floor, looked up and saw Martinez lying near the door. ""He was slumped over, and he was bleeding,"" Hopper told the newspaper. There were 13 others who were injured, police said. Four were hit by a vehicle, eight were shot and one was being treated for injuries whose cause was unclear, authorities said. On Monday, three patients remained at the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, spokeswoman Maria Zate told CNN. Two patients were in good condition and one was in fair condition, she said. On Sunday at the deli, flowers and cards dotted the sidewalk. One message, with a large red heart, read, ""We will miss you, Chris."" Flowers were wedged into holes left by bullets in the glass storefront. 'What a tragic loss' On Sunday, Tri Delta sorority tweeted about Cooper's and Weiss' killings. ""Tri Delta is saddened by the tragic loss of two members at UCSB. Our thoughts are with their family, friends, and Gamma Theta Chapter,"" it read. Weiss' Facebook page -- with a banner promoting a sorority event -- was filling with tributes Saturday evening. ""Rest in peace Veronika Weiss.

Weiss was a graduate of Westlake High School in Thousand Oaks, California, according to her Facebook page. She was a water polo athlete, according to USA Water Polo, which tweeted that the organization was mourning the loss of its former member. Katie Cooper was with Weiss near the Alpha Phi house when the two were killed, reported CNN affiliate KTLA. Cooper studied art history and archaeology at UCSB, according to her Facebook page, KTLA said, and graduated from Ruben S. Ayala High School in Chino Hills in 2010. In an interview with CNN, Bob Weiss, Veronika's father, described his daughter as ""kind"" and the sort of person who would ""reach out"" to those who weren't popular or who were ""nerdy."" He said those descriptions were not unlike the way shooter Elliot Rodger portrayed himself -- as being ""a little bit of an outcast."" ""He had no idea who he was killing,"" Weiss said. ""If he was able to communicate to Veronika, she would have reached out to him. She would have tried to help him. And she would have tried to be friends to him."" Shooter's YouTube video titled 'Retribution' In a YouTube video he posted titled ""Retribution,"" Rodger announced his intent to commit mass murder at a sorority house at UCSB. ""On the day of retribution I'm going to enter the hottest sorority house of UCSB,"" he said. ""I'll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you."" Nick Pasichuke, who was hit by Rodger's BMW, suffered two broken legs. ""There was a guy driving a BMW. I was on a longboard (elongated skateboard) and he aimed his car at our group of friends and gunned it into us,"" he said. ""I have two broken legs and need surgery. The police said I flew roughly 50 feet into a busy intersection."" He added, ""This is all so crazy."" Witness: 'She was hysterical' Skylar Serge witnessed one of the shootings from her house. ""I could see a woman on a bike get thrown,"" she said. The woman was bleeding, she added. ""She was hysterical. She was not sure if it was blood running down her leg"" or water from her water bottle. The woman was cared for by an employee from a nearby convenience store who wrapped a belt around her thigh to stop the bleeding, said another witness, Farah Reiz. The shootings occurred in a crowded area bustling with activity on Memorial Day weekend. ""These students are among the best in the country, and the loss of life is palpable,"" University of California system President Janet Napolitano told CNN. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were sending prayers to the families and friends of the victims. A homeland security official briefed the President about the shooting on Saturday. A posting about the rampage appeared on UC Santa Barbara's website. ""We are horrified and deeply saddened,"" it read, confirming that students had been taken to hospitals. The posting promised that the university would share more information as it became available and said that counselors are being made available.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo may be suspended for three games but Real Madrid made light of his absence by drawing level at the top of La Liga with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid after a 3-0 away win over Getafe Sunday. Ronaldo picked up his ban after being sent off against Athletic Bilbao earlier this month, but it has given his ready made replacement Jese Rodriguez the chance to show his qualities. Jese bears a strong resemblance to Ronaldo with his surging runs and style of play and showed his goalscoring touch after just five minutes as he curled home his fifth goal in six games from Gareth Bale's pass. It was the perfect start as Jese pushed his claims for a place in Vicente del Bosque's Spanish World Cup squad and he continued to impress. French international Karim Benzema doubled Real's advantage after being presented with the chance from Angel di Maria's fine cross just before the break. Record signing Bale was shown a yellow card in the first half and also missed a great chance after being set up by Benzema, but Real had plenty in hand against the struggling home side. Getafe rallied in the second half but could not gain a foothold in the game and their hopes were finally snuffed out by Croatia's Luka Modric. The midfielder scored the third in the 66th minute as his low shot beat Miguel Angel Moya. The three points left Real on 60 points with 14 games still remaining. Barcelona are top on goal difference but their arch-rivals are unbeaten in 24 games in all competitions and have also tightened up in defense. ""Our defensive solidity is very important. At the start of the season we had problems, but now we are more solid, playing with more confidence and look more natural in our play,"" said manager Carlo Ancelotti. ""I hope this continues because we are in the most important part of the season. The mental and physical condition of the players is very good for the upcoming games."" Defeat left Getafe just four points above the relegation zone after a poor run while in other La Liga action Sunday fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao lost 2-1 at home to Espanyol.","Real Madrid beat Getafe 3-0 in La Liga .

"(CNN) -- The spread of the potentially fatal Middle East respiratory syndrome has become more serious and urgent, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. At the same time, WHO said that -- for now, at least -- the illness known as MERS does not constitute a global health emergency . Declaring an emergency is ""a major act"" that can ""raise anxieties,"" said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the organization's assistant director-general for health security. Despite concerns about the syndrome, researchers have not found ""any increasing evidence of person-to-person transmissibility,"" he said. There have been 571 confirmed cases of MERS, including 171 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The number of countries with confirmed cases expanded to 18, with a case in the Netherlands, WHO reported Wednesday. Many of the cases are in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Even without any official worldwide alert, Anne Schuchat, the head of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, acknowledges that ""this is a relatively new virus that does have a high fatality rate,"" ample reason to pay attention. Authorities haven't pinned down all the details about how exactly it arose and how it spreads, though Schuchat said, ""we don't have evidence right now that this is airborne ... the way the measles virus is."" ""We don't know as much as we would like so far,"" the CDC official and assistant surgeon general in the U.S. Public Health Service told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Wednesday. ""... But we're tracking it and trying to understand."" Florida health care workers test negative . Two cases have been confirmed in the United States. Both patients are health care providers who were working in Saudi Arabia. The first is in Indiana; the second in Florida. Two health care workers who came in contact with the Florida patient later went to an emergency room with flu-like symptoms. But they tested negative for MERS in a state test, the CDC said Wednesday. The Florida MERS patient, specifically, was fever-free and continuing to improve Wednesday while undergoing treatment at Orlando's Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, the state's health department said. Given the virus' apparent roots in the Arabian Peninsula, Schuchat said it's important that health care workers ask anyone who has suspicious ""respiratory symptoms"" where they have been in recent weeks. ""More and more people are going to be traveling the next couple of months, so we really want clinicians to be on the lookout,"" she said. Commercial airlines are on guard as well, including efforts to make sure those who might have come into contact with the two MERS patients in the United States didn't come down with the virus. American Airlines said in a statement that it is ""working very closely with the Centers for Disease Control, and contacted our flight crew as soon as we learned of (one such) diagnosis. The CDC is in the process of contacting passengers to advise them of any necessary precautions."" ""We are leaving no stone unturned in ensuring the good health of our employees and customers,"" the airline said. And Delta Airlines said that, like all carriers, it ""has a long-standing protocol for working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, as we are in this instance. The safety of our customers and employees is Delta's top priority."" One traveler who was on one possibly affected flight told CNN affiliate WMKG that the call she got about one confirmed case of MERS left her ""really scared."" Twelve days after her flight, she said, her state health department called and sent her a note asking whether she had symptoms such as fever or cough, and also saying she should record her temperature for two weeks. ""I was in shock that I could actually contract it,"" she said. The woman, who did not want to be identified, said she and her husband so far had no symptoms. Another traveler, Ben Kinney, told CNN affiliate WXIA that the CDC called him twice in two days, saying he was on a flight from Boston to Atlanta with someone who had MERS. He said officials would not disclose how close he was to the patient. Four people -- each from different families -- have been tested in San Antonio for MERS because they were on a plane with one of the two confirmed U.S. patients, said San Antonio health department spokeswoman Carol Schliesinger. None of those four had any suspicious symptoms, she added. Tests for two of them have come back negative for MERS, while the other results are expected in the next couple of days. MERS doesn't spread like flu . MERS, first found in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012, is a coronavirus -- the same group of viruses as the common cold. It attacks the respiratory system. Symptoms can lead to pneumonia or kidney failure. There is no vaccine or special treatment. Besides those who contract the virus by coming into ""very close contact"" with someone suffering, Schuchat cited ""a lot of interesting studies ... about camels and whether some sort of exposure to camels or their products might be important"" in explaining MERS origins. While little is known definitively, ""Fortunately, so far, it hasn't shown itself easily to spread from person to person,"" she added. Dr. William Schaffner, head of preventive medicine of Vanderbilt Medical Center explained Wednesday on CNN's ""New Day"" that MERS can ""spread in the context of providing health care. ""That's very important. And it has occasionally spread in Saudi Arabia from one family member to another. It requires close, constant, over time exposure."" People who go to a doctor or hospital with respiratory symptoms should be asked immediately whether they've traveled to the Middle East or been in contact with someone who did. ""If the answer is yes, you put that person in isolation,"" Schaffner said. Specimens are then taken and sent to the CDC for further testing. ""That system is working,"" he said. Florida's health secretary, Dr. John Armstrong, said Wednesday that the case in his state ""is contained."" ""There is no broad threat to the general public,"" Armstrong said. 5 things to know about MERS . Hagel, others checked for fever . Representatives of 13 countries made up the WHO emergency committee that convened Tuesday through a phone conference, the WHO said. Affected countries need to take immediate steps to improve infection prevention and control, the WHO said. The majority of infections have taken place inside hospitals. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel got a firsthand brush Wednesday with fear of the disease in the land of its likely origin. Before a meeting in Saudi Arabia with Crown Prince Salman Abdulaziz in Jeddah, everyone entering the room with Hagel unwittingly passed by a device screening for fever. Its operators told reporters that they were checking for people who might be infected with the virus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome. They found no one with a raised temperature. WHO does not recommend such a tactic in general, Fukuda said. Some MERS patients don't have fevers, so just checking temperatures could ""create a false sense of security,"" he said. The CDC is not recommending that anyone change travel plans. The U.S. State Department has instructed its embassies and consulates in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Jordan, Kuwait, and the UAE to provide U.S. citizens with CDC's general guidance for infection control, a State Department official said. CNN's Greg Botelho, Miriam Falco, Elizabeth Cohen, Debra Goldschmidt, Aaron Cooper, Jen Christensen and Athena Jones contributed to this report.","NEW: Spokeswoman: 4 tested in San Antonio for MERS; none has symptoms .

"(CNN) -- Not only is Tetsuya Kumakawa the greatest ever Japanese ballet dancer, he is one of the best the world has ever seen. His athletic grace has won him fans wherever he has performed, and his dedication to the art continues to bring ballet to new audiences. Capable of soaring leaps and flawless turns, Tetsuya ""Teddy"" Kumakawa has thrilled audiences the world over. Founded in 1998, his K-Ballet company has built on the success he acheived at the Royal Ballet in Covent Garden, London. Born in Sapporo on Hokkaido -- Japan's North Island -- in 1972, Kumakawa took up ballet after seeing his eight year-old cousin, Hironao perform at school in Sapporo. Like any 10 year old boy, his new hobby had to compete with other activities -- he also enjoyed kendo, baseball and drawing -- but it was ballet that he really fell in love with. From a young age Kumakawa had been keen to see the world and the arrival of foreign guest tutors at his school only reinforced those desires. But it was Swiss ballet teacher Hans Meister's visit to Hokkaido that proved to be a turning point in Kumakawa's nascent career. Meister encouraged him to travel and recommended that he attend the Royal Ballet School (RBS) in London or the Canadian National Ballet School. Kumakawa was just 15 years old when he left home to take up a place at the RBS. Less than two years later, in January 1989, he won both the Gold Medal and the newly established Prince Takamado Prize at the prestigious Prix de Lausanne in Switzerland. He was without question the star of the competition, producing soaring leaps in a performance from 'Don Quixote'. In the spring of 1989 he turned professional, becoming the first Asian dancer to join the Royal Ballet Company (RBC) -- his first solo part was the leading mandolin player in ""Romeo and Juliet."" In June he won the Classical Ballet Prize at the Eurovision Young Dancer of the Year competition held in Paris. Kumakawa experienced a meteoric rise through the ranks of the RBC. He quickly became a Soloist, dancing the Act 1 pas de trois in Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake' and completed a memorable performance as the Bronze Idol in La Bayadère -- a cameo role that showcased his extraordinary jumping ability. The following season he was chosen for the role of the Fool in the premiere of Kenneth Macmillan's 'The Prince and the Pagodas'. In 1991 he was promoted to First Soloist and was a Principal dancer by 1993. So developed a mutual love affair between Kumakawa, his new fans and his adoptive city. ""I was so pleased to participate in British culture,"" he told The Japan Times in 2004. By the age of 26 'Teddy', as he had become known to his friends in the UK -- 'kuma' means 'bear' in Japanese -- had danced the full repertoire of classical and modern roles at the RBC. The man who had wowed London audiences with his acrobatic jumps and audacious turns was about to leap into a new chapter of his life. In 1998 he left the Royal Ballet to found his own company -- the K-Ballet -- back home in Tokyo. It was a highly controversial move at the time. Not only had he upped sticks in the middle of a season, he also took five of the Royal Ballet's star male performers with him to Japan. The British Press and the ballet fraternity were not impressed. Greeted as a returning hero in his native country, Kumakawa took on the roles of leading dancer, teacher, artistic director and company manager simultaneously. But despite the formidable workload and responsibility the new K-Ballet flourished, fostering a wider interest in Japanese ballet. In 2004, Kumakawa established the K-Ballet School. The same year, the K-Ballet became the first Japanese ballet company to perform at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. A career-threatening knee injury, suffered whilst on a K-Ballet tour of Japan in May 2007 has temporarily sidelined Kumakawa from performing. But he expects to be back on stage next year, delighting audiences with virtuoso performances once again. In the meantime, Kumakawa -- who continues to enjoy pop star status in Japan -- continues to pass on his expertise to a new generation of dancers.","The greatest Japanese dancer is known as ""Teddy"" to friends and fans .

"(CNN) -- An estimated 2.5 million pilgrims have descended on the city of Mecca for the Islamic Hajj, said to be the largest annual gathering of people in the world. Every fit and able Muslim is obliged by their faith to make the journey at least once in their lifetime. But with the rising threat of climate change, there are now calls for both pilgrims and authorities in Mecca to reduce the environmental damage wrought by this yearly influx of travelers. ""Everyone arrives at the same time, at exactly the same place, and every year there are more and more people,"" said Dr Husna Ahmed, principal author of ""The Green Guide for Hajj,"" a booklet promoting ecologically-sustainable practices among Hajj pilgrims, released earlier this week. Ahmed, who is CEO of the UK-based Faith Regen Foundation, says that as many as 100 million plastic water bottles were dumped by pilgrims during Hajj last year, according to a study conducted by colleagues at the foundation. Ahmed adds that Mecca's authorities have yet to make adequate provisions for recycling. ""All the waste from food, all the fumes from coaches traveling around the city, all the energy used for powering local hotels, it has a significant environmental impact,"" said Ahmed. ""And that's before you think about the carbon footprint of all those flying in from halfway around the globe."" According to Ahmed, the problem is both practical and cultural. While she is eager for local authorities in Mecca to introduce energy-saving measures, like solar-powered mosques and low-carbon transport initiatives, she says that pilgrims must also become more conscious of their surroundings. ""Unfortunately, the issues of climate change and conservation are not a high priority for many Muslims, particularly those struggling with poverty in the developing world -- for whom simply getting through the day is the main consideration,"" said Ahmed, who hopes that her guide will help emphasize the fundamental link between the theology of Islam and the preservation of nature. It's a message that the newly-formed Green Pilgrimage Network (GPN) is keen to highlight. ""Most religions are implicitly conservationist ... after all, if you think of God as the creator, then it surely befalls you to take care of his creation,"" said Martin Palmer, secretary-general of the network. It is a multi-faith organization that aims to create a worldwide alliance of holy cities committed to sustainable practices, such as banning cars on pilgrimage routes, improving waste management and investing in renewable energy. According to the network, over 100 million people a year embark on a religious pilgrimage, making it one of the single greatest reasons for travel worldwide. For Palmer, the environmental challenges presented by pilgrimages at holy sites like Mecca stem primarily from the trappings of modern living. ""Pilgrimages have become corrupted by consumerism,"" he said. ""For instance, instead of buying millions of plastic bottles, 100 years ago every pilgrim would have traveled with a flask."" Launched last week in the sacred Catholic city of Assisi in Italy, the network comprises 12 founding member cities, including Amritsar in India, where they have pledged to provide clean drinking water for Sikh pilgrims traveling to the Golden Temple there; and in St. Albans in the UK, the Church of England says it will install solar panels on the local cathedral. ""This of course is just the beginning,"" said Palmer, who aims to have at least 300 cities signed up to the network within the next couple of years. To join the network, he says, a city's municipal authority must undertake to work in partnership with the faith community to work towards ""shared environmental goals."" Palmer hopes that being a member of the network will be seen as a badge of honor -- ""like becoming a UNESCO world heritage site"" -- with the threat that those who fail to live up to their commitments will lose membership. While Mecca is not yet a member, Palmer says ""The Green Guide for Hajj,"" is the first step in bringing the city on board. ""I understand that the religious authorities are going through the guide with a fine-tooth comb to make sure it all complies with Islamic law before giving their official endorsement,"" he said. He notes that the local government in Mecca has already displayed a commitment to environmental reform, with the construction of a new metro system capable of transporting 2.5 million pilgrims between shrines currently under way, as well as ongoing discussions to provide water flasks. CNN was unable to make contact with leaders of Mecca during the Hajj holidary period to get comment. According to Omar Faruk, founding director of UK-based pressure group EcoMuslim, conservation is not just compatible with the teachings of Islam, it is integral. ""The Quran says: 'The earth is green and beautiful, and Allah has appointed you stewards over it,'"" said Faruk. ""Put simply, being green is a central part of being a good Muslim."" This is music to the ears of Olav Kjorven, director of policy at the U.N. Development Program, which last year helped produce the ""Muslim Seven Year Action Plan on Climate Change"" and is an official supporter of the Green Pilgrimage Network. ""Religions own up to 8% of the world's habitable land and 5% of commercial forests; run or contribute to more than half of the world's schools; account for up to 7% of all global investments and offer moral and spiritual guidance to approximately 85% of all people,"" said Kjorven. ""Their active engagement on climate change is crucial if we are to realize a greener future for our planet.""","As millions embark on annual Hajj pilgrimage, concern growns over cost to environment .

"(CNN) -- Jana Pittman was the woman to beat in track and field's 400-meter hurdles for nearly a decade, only to suffer crushing disappointment as a string of injuries wrecked her chances of Olympic gold. It must have been tempting to step out of the sporting limelight -- but Pittman did exactly the opposite. Instead she took up the white knuckle sport of bobsleigh, and is making Olympic history in Sochi by becoming the first Australian woman to compete in both the Summer and now Winter Games. Less than 18 months after her first ""terrifying"" run on an ice course, Pittman says she is ""extraordinarily lucky"" to be part of a team in the two-woman event with experienced driver Astrid Radjenovic. Despite being hampered by a lack of funding, and having to replicate the all-important start in bobsleigh by pushing a converted supermarket trolley around her local running track, Pittman is relishing the new challenge after the end of her athletics career. ""I wasn't quite sure what sport, so I pretty much tried everything,"" she tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I tried rowing, I tried boxing and then I got a wonderful call from Astrid to say would I be interested in trying to do bobsled, and pretty much it went from there."" A world champion on the track in 2003 and 2007, Pittman carried the hopes of all Australia going into the Athens and Beijing Olympics the following years -- only for her dreams to be shattered. The final blow came during 2012 when injury again scuppered her chances of competing in the London Olympics. The 31-year-old went into this month's Sochi Winter Games with a realistic view of her chances, free from the previous pressure of expectation. ""I think I want to stop and smell the roses. To actually feel what the spirit of the Games is like,"" she says. ""Other times it sped past with huge expectations on results. This time I got to share it with my friend Astrid and to be part of a small but successful Australian team. ""It has been wonderful. Better than expected, I think this time around I get to really take it in and appreciate the moment."" Not that the competitive fire which spurred on Pittman as she dominated her discipline on the track was ever extinguished. She put herself through a rigorous training regime and bulked up, adding over 10 kg in weight from her hurdling days. ""In an ideal world in bobsled, you want two massive women. This is the sport where everybody gets happy if you've put on a kilo, rather than ""Oooh I've lost a bit of weight!"" she explains. ""It's all about power and speed. You have to run 15 meters, 20, sometimes 30 meters, jump in the sled, and the start really sets you up for the whole run down to the bottom. ""So coming from a track and field background meant I'd lifted weights since I was 15 and I had a very natural running technique behind the sled."" But despite her physical advantages, Pittman also had to adapt her mindset to cope with the fear factor of racing down a icy course at over 140 kph (85 mph), tucked in as brakeman behind her driver Radjenovic. ""You might be a great athlete, you might be able to do this, but you never know if you're actually going to be able to overcome that fear and terror at the top of the hill,"" she admits. ""Really, it just feels like a giant washing machine. It's incredibly fast. I started at one of the hardest tracks in the world so it was pretty much the rollercoaster ride of your life."" That initial training run at Altenburg in Germany was a case of being thrown in at the deep end, but she quickly adapted. ""Astrid was very clever in the fact that she made sure I had to do three runs on my first day because I got out of the first sled and was like, 'I'm going home! This is horrible!' but by the time I went down on the third go, I was absolutely hooked."" The pair had immediate success and took seventh place in a World Cup event on the same track, the best on record by an Australian team. They were 14th after Tuesday's opening heats in Sochi, and maintained that placing in Wednesday's final two. Radjenovic has been to the Turin, Vancouver and now Sochi Games, competing in the sport for 11 years, but coming from nation like Australia, with little history in bobsleigh, the lack of funding has been a challenge. ""Bobsleigh is like Formula One and it costs a lot of money to have fast equipment,"" Radjenovic, also 31, tells CNN. ""So like a Formula One team, if you don't have a lot of money to invest in it, it is hard to do well, which has made it hard for us."" The addition of Pittman has helped raise funds, reaching a target of $A20,000 ($18,000) to help buy a new sled. Sponsors were invited to support the ""Icebirds"" -- which is the nickname the team adopted for branding and publicity purposes. ""Astrid advertised on our Facebook page,"" Pittman says. ""A little competition on names and then people voted. It gave us an identity a team name, so certainly helped with our support."" Pittman said they had also resorted to some unusual training methods in the quest for success. ""We push shopping trolleys in our backyard, we train at a normal athletics track because we don't have snow and we don't have ice, so for Australians to make the Olympics in bobsled is pretty much a 'Cool Runnings' all over again,"" she says. That Hollywood film about the Jamaican bobsleigh team in the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary may well act as an inspiration, but during her storied career in track and field, Pittman was rarely the underdog. Already a world youth champion, she went to her first Olympics on home soil in Sydney in 2000 and won Commonwealth Games gold two years later in Manchester. Then came world championship success in Paris but in the buildup to Athens she picked up a knee injury that required surgery just before the Games. Despite the disadvantage, she still managed a creditable fifth place in the final, although that was little consolation at the time. Further Commonwealth Games success in Melbourne in 2006 was tempered during the course of the year by a very public row with 4x400m relay teammate Tamsyn Lewis, which led to adverse publicity for both athletes. Pittman was reportedly ready to leave Australia and by then she was married to Britain's former champion hurdler Chris Rawlinson, giving birth to their son Cornelis Levi later that year. Relenting on the threat -- ""I've always been a very proud Australian"" -- and coached by Rawlinson, Pittman dominated the 400m hurdles in 2007 and won her second world title in Osaka. However, injuries again took their toll on her Olympic hopes, and her relationship with Rawlinson also soured. After a brief reconciliation they have separated again, leaving Pittman to face life as a working mother. ""I'm studying medicine full-time and I have a little boy who is seven, but for me, having him in my life is so grounding and I feel like I have a very full, loved life so I will certainly not go to my grave with any fears or regrets,"" she says. That also extends to her track and field career, despite missing out on her ultimate goals. ""I've been very lucky that I've been to two Olympic Games and won two senior world titles, so it's certainly been a wonderful career and I'm very grateful for the opportunity."" Pittman also has no intention of fading quietly into retirement post-Sochi, and wants to maintain her partnership with Radjenovic on the World Cup bobsleigh circuit. ""I know that Astrid wants to retire but I'm still trying to get her to go another year,"" she says. ""I've really found something that I love in bobsleigh. It is a great sport, the people in this sport, even from other countries, are really together, they really help you on every possible angle and I think I'd love to stay in this sport if possible."" Failing that, Pittman has also hinted at a return to track and field -- although she would have to shed the extra muscle that is such an asset in bobsleigh to be competitive in running events. That would appear not to offer much of an obstacle for a young woman who is renowned for being singleminded with athletic excellence in mind. In 2010 she caused a stir by revealing that she had undergone surgery to remove breast implants, feeling they were affecting her performance on the track. ""Every time I raced I panicked about whether I was letting my country down, all for my own vanity,"" she was quoted as saying at the time. ""I don't want to short-change Australia either."" After her heroic efforts to reach the Olympics in an entirely new sport, that's certainly not something Pittman could ever be accused of. ""It was lovely to have the support of the public, they helped get us our new sled and really got behind us all year,"" she says with pride.","Jana Pittman is former two-time world 400m hurdles champion .

"(CNN) -- Ray Herrera does not mince words about what his 12-year-old son, Jack, went through. Jack Herrera is one of six people to die this year because of the naegleria fowleri amoeba. ""It's beyond description to watch your most precious, beautiful, wonderful, loved one become a vegetable essentially and then die,"" Herrera said. In August, Jack returned from summer camp that included swims in Texas' Lake LBJ. Five days after coming home he was dead, killed by a microscopic amoeba. ""He was the happiest boy anyone ever knew,"" Herrera said. Jack is one of six people to die this summer in the United States from the naegleria fowleri amoeba. All were believed by health officials to have contracted an infection from the amoeba from swimming in warm, freshwater lakes, rivers or natural springs.  See timeline of the sudden deaths » . There is no risk from properly chlorinated swimming pools, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The amoeba enters the human body through the nose. It then travels to the brain, where it begins to feed. Symptoms of the amoeba's rampage begin 1 to 14 days after infection and resemble the flu. At the onset of those symptoms the amoeba victim's health swiftly declines.  Watch how to reduce risk of contracting the amoeba » . At this point, says Dr. Kevin Sherin of the Orange County Health Department who is investigating three deaths this summer in Florida, ""It's progressing very rapidly and then there's a downhill course for them there. Folks lapse into a coma, there are abnormal movements of the eyes and a terrible cascade of events leading to the actual death of parts of the brain."" Although exposure to the amoeba is usually fatal, Sherin says a cocktail of drugs can fight the amoeba if administered in time. The key, he says, is identifying the amoeba early. In the hot summer months when the amoeba flourishes, he said, doctors need to learn to look for the symptoms of an amoeba-related illness. ""Physicians have to consider it. The public needs to consider it,"" Sherin said. ""If you have a flu-like illness or a bad headache following swimming in a freshwater body and the temperature is over 80 degrees Fahrenheit, be aware of this."" However, only a handful of doctors have seen a patient with the rare amoeba. Until this summer there were only 24 known cases of it in the U.S. since 1989, according to the CDC. Health officials cannot explain the spike in cases this summer, except that weather plays a factor. ""Because it's been such a hot summer, that has contributed to warmer water temperatures and lower water levels and that makes an ideal environment for the amoeba,"" said Dr. Rebecca Sunenshine of the Arizona Department of Health, which is investigating a death last month there tied to the amoeba. Another question health officials have is why the amoeba seems to appear more often in young males. All six victims this summer were male, ages 10 to 22 years old. One theory, the CDC says, is that young males might be more likely to engage in water sports such as water skiing or wakeboarding. Those can lead to greater exposure to the amoeba. But other than wearing nose plugs while swimming or staying out of freshwater above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, there is little people can do to prevent exposure to the amoeba. Health officials say federal or local governments have few tools to combat the amoeba. Even testing the water for amoeba levels, said the CDC's Dr. Michael Beach, would be of minimal benefit to swimmers.

Dr. Kevin Sherin said the department does not have the authority to deny access to public lakes and that privately owned lake areas would remain open regardless of any action to close the lakes. Instead, the health department has posted signs at 15 swimming and boating areas where people may face exposure to the amoeba. The effectiveness of the signs appears mixed. When a CNN crew recently visited a bathing area near a natural spring, the water was packed with families.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Catalonia's November 9 independence referendum will not be held as planned due to the suspension of the vote by Spain's Constitutional Court, Catalan President Artur Mas announced Tuesday in Barcelona. Mas said the decree he recently signed authorizing the referendum ""now has no effect,"" given that the Constitutional Court has accepted the Spanish government's appeal for study, automatically suspending the vote. The Spanish government, in appealing to the Constitutional Court, said the Catalan vote as planned for November 9 was unconstitutional because the constitution holds that all of Spain, not just one region such as Catalonia, must decide on the country's future. Scottish independence vote closely watched . Hundreds of thousands of Catalans have demonstrated in recent years for an independence referendum, and they closely watched the recent independence vote in Scotland. Even after Scotland voted to remain a part of the United Kingdom, many Catalans said the key issue was being able to vote in Catalonia on independence, which the Spanish government has opposed. Mas said there will still be a vote on November 9, but it will be organized by the Catalan government under Catalan legislation that has not been blocked by the court. It will be called a ""consultation,"" and will be conducted by volunteers, not the usual electoral officials. And the polling places will be only in Catalan regional government buildings, not at numerous other sites, such as at city halls, many of which had opposed the referendum. Unity in question . Mas said the Catalan political parties -- including his nationalist Convergence and Union party -- that had favored the referendum and independence are no longer as united as they recently were on the issue. Leftist pro-independence parties have insisted that the November 9 referendum be held as planned, despite the court's ruling, and some have called for a unilateral declaration of independence. On September 11, Catalan national day, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Barcelona for the third year in a row, demanding a vote on independence be held. Self-governance . But Madrid argues that Catalonia, which represents one fifth of Spain's economy, already has broad home-rule powers, including its own parliament, police force and control over education and health. And it insists that the Spanish Constitution does not allow any of Spain's 17 regions to unilaterally break away. Catalonia is a region of northeastern Spain, with Barcelona -- the second-largest city in Spain -- as its capital. If there is eventually a referendum, voters are expected to be asked a two-part question: ""Should Catalonia be a state?"" And those who vote yes to that can then vote on the second question: ""Should that state be independent?"" Polls indicate that a majority of Catalans want to have a chance to vote but that less than a majority would vote for independence, given the chance.","There will be no independence referendum in November, Catalan president says .
Spain's Constitutional Court suspended the vote to hear government's appeal .
Catalonia, in northeastern Spain, already has its own parliament, police force ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Chris Christie used about 2,000 words to deliver different messages to different audiences Tuesday in his second inaugural address, this one under the specter of scandal. The embattled New Jersey governor made no mention of the multiple investigations into alleged political retribution exacted by his administration. Instead, he spoke as a re-elected governor to his state and the early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, if he decides to run, to a cheering crowd in the Trenton War Memorial. Most importantly, Christie emphasized themes of unity and moving beyond partisan politics to try to reassure crucial Independent voters shaken by the controversy over traffic gridlock as alleged political payback. Here is what he said, and what he really was saying: . ""A tough New Jersey. A resilient New Jersey. A proud New Jersey."" Christie was talking about himself as much as his state when, early in the speech, he spoke of the bond established with the people of New Jersey during his first term. ""We have endured the worst economic recession of our lifetimes and we have begun to triumph over it,"" he said, establishing the ""all-in-this-together"" theme of the speech that sought to also boost state pride. ""We have survived the worst natural disaster in our state's history and we have worked together to restore, renew and rebuild the state that we love,"" he added, noting that ""each one of these challenges has been met by a new, unified force in public life - a New Jersey setting the tone for an entire nation."" Then came the triple kicker, received with lengthy applause: ""A tough New Jersey. A resilient New Jersey. A proud New Jersey."" Low profile for Democrats as Christie inaugurated . ""A New Jersey that has put aside political partisanship on the important issues ... "" With polls showing public disgust with the partisan politics of Washington, Christie portrayed himself as a leader who can overcome ideological divisions. His goal was to contrast his record in a politically divided state with Democratic President Barack Obama's inability to divine much partisan progress from a similarly divided Congress. New Jersey Democrats note their control of the state legislature means every law passed and signed by Christie must be bipartisan, by definition. To the governor, the victor gets the spoils and he hailed ""a New Jersey that has put aside political partisanship on the important issues to our people to take advantage of the opportunities each of these challenges has presented us with every day."" Later in the speech, Christie expanded on that theme,saying ""we cannot fall victim to the attitude of Washington, D.C."" ""The attitude that says I am always right and you are always wrong,"" he said. ""The attitude that puts everyone into a box that they are not permitted to leave. The attitude that puts political wins ahead of policy agreements. The belief that compromise is a dirty word."" Hot piece of land in Hoboken at center of Christie-Zimmer dispute . ""Each vote cast is an act of faith and trust."" In a key message of the speech, Christie presented himself as a leader able to win support across the political spectrum, which will be the most necessary attribute for a Republican presidential candidate. Obama won re-election in 2012 by thumping GOP challenger Mitt Romney in key demographics such as women, young voters, Hispanic Americans and African Americans. It appears that Christie hopes to generate broad-based support and fundraising by claiming the title as most electable Republican from the start. ""You see, elections are about more than TV ads and debates and rallies. Each vote cast is an act of faith and trust,"" he said to set up the bond between candidate and citizen. Referring to his November re-election, Christie said ""it wasn't just some of our people who affirmed this course."" ""It was not a vocal plurality like four years ago,"" he continued to growing applause and cheers. ""No, this time, it was the largest and loudest voice of affirmation that the people of our state have given to any direction in three decades."" One by one, he listed the elements of his broad-based support -- an enviable collection for any candidate of any party. ""Suburbanites and city dwellers. African Americans and Latinos. Women and men. Doctors and teachers. Factory workers and tradesmen. Republicans and Democrats and independents,"" Christie said. Later in the speech, he made sure to mention how the state passed an immigration law on his watch that gave some children of immigrants living illegally in New Jersey a break on their tuition. The issue is paramount to Hispanic Americans and the subject of major political division in Washington. To CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger, Christie was declaring to GOP backers and independents looking to get behind a winner that he can attract a ""very broad"" coalition like the one that gave him his second term. Don't trash Jersey until you've traveled it . ""Now we have no moral option but to heed the voice of the voters ... "" With this line, Christie sought to seal the bond with New Jerseyans and also convince people nationwide that he could be trusted with their votes come 2016, if he runs. A new national poll released Tuesday showed Christie losing ground to the early Democratic presidential frontrunner in 2016, Hillary Clinton. The biggest shift in the Quinnipiac University survey was among Independent voters, who were split between Christie and Clinton in December but now go for Clinton by a 15-percentage point margin. It also indicated that Christie's standing among voters has dropped since the controversies facing his administration became more prominent in the past two weeks. ""He's paying a political price with those Independents,"" Borger said, adding that on the issue of voter trust, ""he's got a lot of work to do there."" It's not impossible, she noted, saying Independent voters ""can always shift back, but he has to win them back."" Tuesday's speech tried to do exactly that. ""Now we have no moral option but to heed the voice of the voters and that is exactly what I intend to do,"" Christie said to applause. ""Today, I thank all those who have once again placed their faith and trust in me and I make this promise: I will not let up, I will insist we work together and I will make this government truly work for those who pay for it,"" he continued to another ovation. Trump: Christie 'one email away from a disaster' ""I do not believe that New Jerseyans want a bigger, more expensive government ... "" While Christie's poll numbers among Republicans remain strong, he remains vulnerable to conservative criticism that he is too moderate for the hardliners on the GOP right. Some will never forgive him for buddying up with Obama when they toured the Superstorm Sandy devastation a few days before the 2012 election, a break in final campaign coverage considered beneficial to the President's victory. His speech offered some red meat to conservatives by stressing his opposition to tax hikes sought by Democrats who control the state legislature. ""I do not believe that New Jerseyans want a bigger, more expensive government that penalizes success and then gives the pittance left to a few in the name of income equity,"" Christie said, delivering a conservative mantra. ""What New Jerseyans want is an unfettered opportunity to succeed in the way that they define success. They want an equal chance at the starting line; not a government guaranteed result."" His applause followed by calling for policies ""that believe in the effort, the talent and the optimism of New Jerseyans, not in the power of almighty government to fix any problem, real or imagined."" ""So, let's be different than our neighbors,"" Christie said to cheers. ""Let's put more money in the pockets of our middle class by not taking it out of their pockets in the first place."" Opinion: How Christie could rebound - and come out stronger . ""The ways we divide each other ... is neither permanent nor necessary."" While he needs at least some conservative support to survive the GOP primaries for 2016, Christie knows that any chance in a general election requires the support of independent voters and perhaps even some disenchanted Democrats. So he tried to tread a somewhat tricky middle ground by proposing both conservative and moderate policies and ideas. ""This election has taught us that the ways we divide each other -- by race, by class, by ethnicity, by wealth, and yes by political party -- is neither permanent nor necessary,"" Christie said. ""You see, our dreams are the same: a good job, a great education for our children, safe streets in our neighborhood and core values which give lives real meaning. Those dreams are not unique to any one group in our state."" He then sounded like a conservative-tinged populist by encouraging personal responsibility to help each other. ""We have to be willing to play outside the red and blue boxes that the media pundits put us in,"" he said to applause. ""We have to be willing to reach out to others who look or speak differently than us; we have to be willing to personally reach out a helping hand to a neighbor or a friend suffering from drug addiction, depression or the dignity stripping loss of a job."" Continuing the theme, Christie outlined policy directions on education and drug enforcement that straddled the ideological spectrum. ""We will make it our priority to have every child in New Jersey have a chance to get a good education,"" he said, again prompting applause and cheers by adding that ""no matter what adult we have to offend, no matter where you came from, no matter what sacred cow we must slay, no matter how much we have to change the conventional thinking, we will no longer stand for the achievement gap which exists between our best and least educated children."" Then he became more liberal, saying ""we will end the failed war on drugs that believes that incarceration is the cure of every ill caused by drug abuse."" ""We will make drug treatment available to as many of our non-violent offenders as we can,"" Christie said, ""and we will partner with our citizens to create a society that understands this simple truth: every life has value and no life is disposable."" Is this what 'Jersey-style' means? CNN's Paul Steinhauser, Virginia Nicolaidis, Jake Tapper and Steve Brusk contributed to this report.","Embattled New Jersey governor seeks to sound presidential in inaugural address .

"(CNN) -- A flight from Chicago to Shanghai suffered an apparent bird strike after takeoff and landed safely back at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Sunday. American Airlines Flight 289 took off around 10:45 a.m. Shortly after, the crew reported a problem on board. By 11:18 a.m. the plane was back on an O'Hare runway, according to a spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of Aviation. My-Linh Bui, American Airlines spokeswoman, said the problem was apparently a bird strike. None of the 236 passengers or 15 crew members was injured. Mechanics are looking at the plane, Bui said. Passengers booked to Shanghai will depart on another flight. Bird strike is the term used for incidents in which planes collide with birds. Often the creatures get sucked into a plane's engine. Considering how small they are compared to a plane, they can cause big problems. The Federal Aviation Administration tracks these incidents. It says wildlife, both feathered and furry, has done billions of dollars in damage over the years. In the past 12 months alone, O'Hare has reported 122 such wildlife strikes. Everything from a wood thrush to a barn swallow has tangled with airplanes there. Run-ins with a coyote and a cottontail were also reported. Of those, only one resulted in any notable problem. In November a red-tailed hawk and a Nippon cargo plane, a 747, collided. Substantial damage resulted. One of the most famous bird-plane encounters in recent years resulted in the ""Miracle on the Hudson."" On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 left LaGuardia Airport and ran into a flock of geese that damaged both engines, forcing the crew to make an emergency landing in the frigid Hudson River. Rescuers quickly reached the aircraft and found passengers standing on its wings. Everyone was rescued.","Flight to Shanghai returns safely to Chicago about half an hour after takeoff .

"(CNN) -- After being humbled by Manchester City in the FA Cup and drawing against West Bromwich Albion in the English Premier League, Chelsea could hardly afford to drop points against Everton on Saturday. The Blues didn't -- barely. And it was the man who has been dubbed 'Mr. Chelsea,' the returning John Terry, who struck deep in injury time following a free kick from another Chelsea veteran, Frank Lampard. Both were re-introduced to the starting lineup by manager Jose Mourinho against a stubborn Everton side chasing a European spot and the 1-0 victory temporarily increased Chelsea's lead atop the table to four points over Arsenal. The Gunners, however, once again cut the deficit to one point by later easing past Sunderland 4-1 and Man City stayed within three points of Chelsea -- with a game in hand -- courtesy of a 1-0 win over Stoke City. Vintage Chelsea it wasn't, but the result was all that mattered to Chelsea skipper Terry. ""We made it difficult but they are a very good side and are playing well under (Everton manager Roberto) Martinez,"" Terry, sidelined the previous three games with a muscle injury, told BT Sport. ""It was a tough game today. We're delighted with the win and three points."" Martinez wasn't delighted, though. He felt the free kick -- given when Chelsea midfielder Ramires went down -- shouldn't have been given by referee Lee Probert. ""It was one of those situations where players were trying to buy too many free kicks,"" Martinez told BT Sport. ""You need a strong referee. The second half is a very, very tough game for referee. ""You can see they are trying to get a dead ball situation because they couldn't get any joy from open play. You can see the reaction and way he loses his footing, it's not because of contact. He is looking for the free kick."" For more than 90 minutes, Everton indeed kept Chelsea at bay. Everton had the better of play in the first half, with Petr Cech saving from Leon Osman and Kevin Mirallas scuffing his shot when in a good position at the edge of the box. Chelsea could only go one way -- up -- and keeper Tim Howard foiled Lampard, Eden Hazard and Branislav Ivanovic before Terry's winner. ""Great ball from Lamps,"" said Terry. ""I just managed to get a touch on it and I think it came off Howard in the end as well."" Arsenal, City respond . Arsenal and Manchester City, coming off demoralizing 2-0 home defeats to Bayern Munich and Barcelona in the Champions League, respectively, earned three points in contrasting fashion. Olivier Giroud, benched against Bayern Munich in favor of the inexperienced Yaya Sanogo, started and scored twice for Arsenal. Arsene Wenger, though, left record signing Mesut Ozil out of the squad after he missed a penalty against Bayern and was criticized on the pitch by teammate Mathieu Flamini on Wednesday for not doing enough defensively. City toiled against Stoke City at home, getting the lone goal from midfielder Yaya Toure in the 70th minute. ""Teams come here to defend and try to get a draw,"" City manager Manuel Pellegrini told the club website. ""We cannot win by three or four goals every match."" Next up for City is Sunderland in the League Cup final on March 2. West Ham further eased its relegation worries by beating Southampton 3-1 for a fourth straight victory, Hull added to Cardiff's woes by thrashing the Welsh side 4-0 in Wales and Felix Magath earned a point in his managerial debut for last-place Fulham, with the Cottagers tying West Brom 1-1. Wayne Rooney, who signed a lucrative contract extension with Manchester United on Friday, celebrated with a goal in United's 2-0 win at Crystal Palace. ""He's a really important player,"" United manager David Moyes told Sky Sports. ""You think about the amount of clubs who wanted to sign him. Wayne is one of the top players, he shows it week in, week out. ""We never had any intention of letting him go. Wayne has been great since day one."" Yet United still trails Liverpool by eight points in the race for the final Champions League spot. Liverpool hosts Swansea on Sunday while Tottenham, in fifth and three points behind the Reds, visits Norwich.","Chelsea defeats Everton 1-0 at home thanks to a goal deep in injury time .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The Iranian judiciary said Wednesday it is considering a request for setting bail in the case of two American hikers convicted of spying and sentenced to eight years in prison. ""The two U.S. nationals accused of spying have not been released and their attorneys' requests for setting bail is being considered,"" the judiciary said. The statement, posted on the judiciary's website, seems to contradict accounts previously given by the hikers' attorney and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Attorney Masoud Shafiee said Tuesday his clients, Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer, would be released from Tehran's Evin prison after a $500,000 bail was paid for each of them. On Wednesday, an Omani plane was en route to Tehran carrying an Omani official who will be working on any negotiation, a Western diplomat told CNN. But it was not clear whether the hostages would be free to leave, the source said. Fattal and Bauer have been held for more than two years. They and a third hiker, Sarah Shourd, were arrested July 31, 2009, after apparently straying across an unmarked border between Iraq and Iran while hiking in northern Iraq's Kurdish region. They said they were unaware they had crossed into Iran, but Iranian authorities said they were spies who entered the country illegally. Shourd, who is Bauer's fiancee, was released last year for medical reasons, although authorities said her case remains open. Last month, Fattal and Bauer were convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison -- five years for espionage and three years for illegal entry, according to Iranian media. Their appeal is pending. In an interview with NBC that aired Tuesday, Ahmadinejad said the hikers could be released ""in a couple of days"" but did not mention bail. The president suggested there is a need for the United States to release Iranians held in its jails. ""OK, these two persons will be released,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""Is it going to be over? We do it, for example, in (a) humanitarian gesture. Is it going to solve the problems? I hope so."" But in the statement posted Wednesday, the judiciary said that ""the case is currently being considered by the presiding judge, and any related news will be given by the judiciary."" ""No other source is entitled to provide news about this case,"" it said. The contradictory information may point to a long-simmering rift in the Iranian government. In Iran, the clerics, not the president, control the courts. In addition, the hikers may have become a political hot potato in Iran. In April, a public spat erupted between Ahmadinejad and Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Top officials and media outlets close to Khamenei criticized the president, and several of his top aides were reportedly arrested, one for ""sorcery."" On April 17, Ahmadinejad fired Intelligence Minister Heidar Moslehi, and Khamenei vetoed the move. The president publicly denied any disagreement. But public criticism has also targeted one of Ahmadinejad's in-laws and chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei. He and several others in the government are considered by Iran's hardliners to have strayed from the path of revolution and the direction set by Khamenei, as well as the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. Mashaei's nationalistic statements and his alleged contacts with the West, including the United States, have caused the clerics and the hardliners to launch an open campaign against him. They are reluctant, however, to attack Ahmadinejad directly, as Khamenei supported him after his re-election, according to a political analyst. The heads of two of Iran's three branches of government, meanwhile, are brothers -- Ali Larijani is the speaker of parliament, and Ayatollah Sadegh Amoli Larijani is the head of the judiciary. The two may well attempt to thwart what they consider to be anti-cleric and anti-revolutionary actions by Mashaei, who is close to Ahmadinejad, the analyst said. Separately, a human rights group issued a statement criticizing Ahmadinejad for using the hikers as political pawns. ""Ahmadinejad is trying to use the hikers' release for political gains on the international stage,"" said Hadi Ghaemi, spokesman for the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. ""No one should be fooled. The question is, why were these young men deprived of their liberty for so long on trumped-up charges and without proper judicial proceedings? Moreover, why isn't anyone held accountable for this injustice?"" The organization said it welcomed the news of the hikers' possible release, but noted they have been held for more than two years ""without any substantive evidence supporting the espionage charges against them. Their detention and sudden release is seemingly another example of politically motivated arrests and prosecutions by the Iranian judiciary and impunity for officials that bend Iranian laws and violate human rights."" Amnesty International issued a statement Wednesday calling for the hikers' immediate release. ""The Iranian authorities must stop treating Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal as pawns -- both in their dealings with the U.S. government and in domestic political rivalries,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa. ""All available evidence and the authorities' conduct throughout the trial suggests that the Iranian authorities have known all along that these men were not spies,"" he said. ""Rather, it appears they were probably held in order to try to gain political concessions from the USA."" CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr and Elise Labott contributed to his report.","An Omani official is en route to Tehran, a Western diplomat says .

"(CNN) -- Today's hotel bathrooms are more than the sum of their sinks and shower heads. They serve as ultimate sanctuaries, providing the comforts of home or transporting guests to another realm. ""We're seeing more attention to details,"" says Kathleen Dauber, a partner at Hirsch Bedner Associates, the world's largest hotel-design company. In addition to technological innovations, such as TV screens that turn into mirrors when you approach them, Dauber sees a trend of pulling back on furnishings to make way for open areas. ""Space is luxury,"" she says. Fresh air and natural light are prized commodities, as are stunning views of skylines or natural landscapes. Fragmentation of areas within the room according to function is popular, such as separating the salle de bain from the toilet. And curating regional aesthetics and incorporating interesting materials is also top of mind; local supplies and recycled construction resources are layered with classically opulent stone, glass, wood and other substances. Here are ten hotel bathrooms that cohesively balance utility and beauty. Song Saa, Cambodia . Song Saa, on a private island in southern Cambodia, has generous terrazzo composite-stone bathtubs placed strategically to afford views of each room's individual infinity pool and the Gulf of Thailand. Playing to its natural setting, the property created its rustic-chic vanities from driftwood and recycled timbers and incorporated sustainable materials like bamboo into items such as the towel rails. The wooden statues from the hill tribes of the Ratanakiri province in northern Cambodia provide a local touch that counterbalances the Australian Aesop body products. Rooms start at $1,117 (all-inclusive). Park Hyatt Vienna . Opened in June, Park Hyatt Vienna has a Presidential Suite that comes with a grand marble bathroom containing a striking lapis lazuli wall and a walk-in rain shower. But the real showstopper is the gilded bath, reminiscent of the sensual paintings of hometown artist Gustav Klimt. Illuminated by a tiered chandelier, the golden vessel turns the everyday act of bathing into an artistic ritual. Rooms start at $510. Departures: Hotels with gorgeous views . 21c Cincinnati . As the name suggests, 21c Museum Hotels mixes boutique accommodations with stupendous collections of contemporary art under one roof. Its 156-room Cincinnati property married designs by starchitect Deborah Berke with local craftsmanship: It commissioned Rookwood Pottery, the city's heritage ceramic producer whose roots date back to 1880, to manufacture Berke's whimsical bathroom tiles that mimic ears, lips, breasts and other body parts. The result is an elegantly simple bathroom with bright white interiors that, upon closer inspection, surprises with cheeky twists. Rooms start at $300. Andaz Peninsula Papagayo Resort, Costa Rica . Designed by local talent Ronald Zurcher, this Costa Rican retreat engages with its natural surroundings and local traditions. The bathroom's spacious walk-in rain shower opens to the balcony, effortlessly bringing in the pristine Costa Rican outdoors. The floors feature rocks and pebbles from the area and textiles and artifacts from local artisans, paying homage to the folk traditions of the Guanacaste province. Rooms start at $450. Departures: Signature hotel desserts . Four Seasons Resort Langkawi . Situated inside a UNESCO geopark of rainforests and dramatic cliffs, the 91 pavilions and villas of Four Seasons Resort Langkawi blend Malay, Arabic and South Asian architectural stylesâ€”and nowhere is the beautiful mÃ©lange more evident than in its guest bathrooms. Featuring soaring arches, bright skylights and outdoor soaking tubs in private gardens, the little personal spas incorporate Arabic flourishes, Malay artifacts, ornate wooden screens and handcrafted hanging mirrors finished with antique patinas. Rooms start at $540. The Viceroy, New York . In Suite 57, the penthouse crown jewel of New York's Viceroy hotel, Paonazzo marble is used so generously that even the oversized soaking tub is made of the classic material that was favored among designers in the early 20th century. Drawing from the luxurious design elements of the hotel lobby and the suite itself, the master bathroom features an original collection of lighting fixtures and hand-perforated brass hardware. A highlight? The sweeping views of Central Park from the sprawling dual shower. $5,500 a night. Departures: Lush hotel patios and gardens . The Ritz-Carlton, Bahrain Hotel & Spa . At the Ritz-Carlton, Bahrain Hotel & Spa, you may be drawn to the walk-in power showers by Jacob Delafon of Paris or the overflow infinity-style Jacuzzi from Kohler or the glass walls overlooking a sun-soaked garden. But it's the subtle touches that really delight, such as the discreet palm-leaf motif that is embossed in a gypsum frieze around the room and is visible when illuminated at night. Rooms start at $280. Point Yamu by COMO, Phuket, Thailand . Paola Navone designed Point Yamu by COMO, which is slated to open in September. The bathrooms in the Bay Suites combine deep-blue tiles, clean lines, hanging light fixtures and varied textures to create a vibrant atmosphere. Made with 95 percent local resources, including natural wood, the ceramic-intense rooms make a bold, clean statement with touches of nature. Bay Suites start at $280. Departures: The hotel suites to book in New York . The Oberoi, Dubai . The executive chairman of the Oberoi Group was directly involved in designing every detail of its Dubai outpost. Employing uncluttered lines and classic marble, the guest bathrooms demonstrate sophisticated restraint. The most notable features is the floor-to-ceiling windows that display breathtaking uninterrupted views of the Dubai skyline, including the Old City and the iconic Burj Khalifa. Rooms start at $790. Hoshino Resorts KAI Aso, Japan . Bathing in hot-spring water is an essential part of staying at a ryokan, a Japanese inn, and Hoshino Resorts KAI Aso, at the foothills of an active volcano, updates the cleansing ritual to new heights. Every villa on the six-and-a-half-acre property is equipped with a private outdoor tub on a terrace that juts into the surrounding verdant forest, allowing guests to poach mineral-rich volcanic water from the mountains. Unspoiled air, natural light, infinite space and breathtaking views: Some traditions deserve to be trendy. Rooms start at $770 (including breakfast and kaiseki dinner).

"(CNN) -- Federal prosecutors in New Jersey have subpoenaed documents from political groups linked to Gov. Chris Christie over an unfolding scandal involving suggestions senior state government appointees abused their authority to punish a local mayor politically, according to a law firm involved in the case. The office of U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman has sought documents from Christie's reelection campaign and the New Jersey State Committee, which is controlled by the governor, relating to the alleged scheme that has rocked Christie's administration, Mark Sheridan of Patton Boggs said in a statement. The firm is representing both groups in investigations by the Justice Department and a special state committee, which has also sought materials from them, he said. ""The campaign and the state party intend to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's office and the state legislative committee and will respond to the subpoenas accordingly,"" Sheridan said. Rebekah Carmichael, a spokeswoman for Fishman, said that ""we can neither confirm nor deny any specific investigative actions."" Sheridan said the subpoenas involve investigations of whether top Christie appointees orchestrated traffic gridlock around the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee over several days last September in an apparent bid to punish that town's mayor, Mark Sokolich, for not endorsing their boss for reelection. Christie denies any knowledge of the alleged scheme, but he fired one aide at the center of it and three others whose names have surfaced in e-mails around the scandal have also left their jobs. The scandal has heated up with Christie taking the oath of office for a second term this week. It has also raised questions about his brash governing style that has propelled him to the top of polls of potential Republican presidential candidates in 2016. The U.S. Attorney's office and state legislative investigators are also looking at allegations top New Jersey government officials pressured another local mayor, Dawn Zimmer of Hoboken, to back a redevelopment project favored by Christie as a condition of receiving Superstorm Sandy relief funds for her city. The officials, including Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, denied the accusation. Representatives from Fishman's office and the FBI interviewed two of Zimmer's staffers this week, according to a source close to the investigation. Chief of Staff Dan Bryan and communications manager Juan Melli told federal investigators Zimmer had told them Guadagno linked Sandy relief to her support for the development project. Zimmer has met with Fishman's office as well. CNN's Chris Frates contributed to this story.","U.S. Attorney's office in New Jersey issues subpoenas, lawyer says .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will submit a letter to the United Nations Security Council Friday requesting formal U.N. recognition of Palestinian statehood, according to a top Palestinian official. Abbas met Wednesday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who promised that the request will be taken ""very seriously,"" Dr. Nabeel Shaath told reporters on hand for the 66th session of the U.N. General Assembly -- a session dominated concerns over the intractable Israeli-Palestinian . Ban said it will ""not take long"" to get Security Council consideration, Shaath said. Abbas will give ""some time"" to the Security Council before trying to negotiate statehood via the General Assembly, Shaath said. ""We do not think of this as a tactic or as a bluff,"" he stressed. ""This is really a moment of truth."" Shaath said that settling for a lesser status at the United Nations -- such as becoming a non-state member -- is one option under consideration if the push for statehood is ultimately blocked. But the Palestinians do not want ""anybody to suspect a lack of seriousness,"" he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. vehemently opposes U.N recognition of a Palestinian state, arguing that such a development would derail an already fragile Middle East peace process. News of Abbas' plan came shortly after U.S. President Obama told members of the General Assembly that he shares their frustration with the apparent inability to find a resolution to the decades-old conflict. Obama resisted calls for formal U.N. recognition of an independent Palestinian state, however, asserting that ""peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the U.N."" Obama has been trying to mend political fences with wary backers of Israel at home while avoiding the diplomatic fallout that would accompany a U.S. veto of a Security Council measure endorsing recognition of a Palestinian state. ""I know that many are frustrated by the lack of progress,"" Obama told members of the General Assembly. ""So am I. But the question isn't the goal we seek -- the question is how to reach it. And I am convinced that there is no shortcut to the end of a conflict that has endured for decades."" ""One year ago, I stood at this podium and called for an independent Palestine,"" Obama noted. ""I believed then -- and I believe now -- that the Palestinian people deserve a state of their own. But what I also said is that genuine peace can only be realized between Israelis and Palestinians themselves."" He said that a year later, despite extensive U.S. efforts, ""the parties have not bridged their differences."" ""Faced with this stalemate, I put forward a new basis for negotiations in May. That basis is clear, and well-known to all of us here. Israelis must know that any agreement provides assurances for their security. Palestinians deserve to know the territorial basis of their state."" Later, Obama met with Netanyahu and declared that ""the bonds between the U.S. and Israel are unbreakable."" Netanyahu called U.S. opposition to immediate U.N. recognition of Palestinian statehood a ""badge of honor."" Obama told Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in talks on Tuesday that the Palestinian effort would not advance a ""shared goal"" of resolving the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict, according to Liz Sherwood-Randall, a top U.S. National Security Council aide. Obama also urged Erdogan to continue work toward patching up Turkey's strained relations with Israel, Sherwood-Randall said. Among other things, Obama also used his address to the General Assembly Wednesday to tackle a range of issues relating to the so-called Arab Spring, celebrating the toppling of autocratic rulers in Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia, while expressing support for reform movements in Bahrain, Yemen, and elsewhere. The president also sought to rally international support for African famine relief, and provided backing for both European economic efforts and international measures to combat climate change. For the world in general, Obama declared, ""the tide of war is receding."" The U.S. leader asserted that the belief that change could come through violence died with al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's demise. ""This has been a difficult decade,"" he said. ""But today, we stand at a crossroads of history with the chance to move decisively in the direction of peace."" The Obama administration is seeking this week to reinforce a foreign policy strategy that emphasizes cooperation and shared responsibility after what has been criticized as a ""might makes right"" posture by the United States in past decades. The administration ""has dramatically changed America's course at the United Nations to advance our interests and values and help forge a more secure and prosperous world,"" declared a White House document released Tuesday. ""We have repaired frayed relations with countries around the world. We have ended needless American isolation on a range of issues. And as a consequence, we have gotten strong cooperation on things that matter most to our national security interest. "" The document cited ""concrete results"" at the United Nations that it said advanced ""U.S. foreign policy objectives and American security,"" including: . -- The stiffest U.N. sanctions ever against Iran and North Korea; . -- Efforts to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and materials; . -- The Libya intervention and subsequent efforts to aid the political transition there; . -- The peaceful independence of Southern Sudan; and, . -- U.N. assistance in Afghanistan and Iraq. In addition, the White House document said the United States is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance for the Horn of Africa famine, with most of the $600 million provided so far funneled through U.N. agencies.

"(CNN) -- Vacation is a time to relax, revert to simpler times, disconnect from our 18 electronic devices and get back to the basics, but not so much that it means waking up to the rooster's crow at the break of dawn or shelling field peas all day. So, we're taking you around the world to five resorts where all the roots are planted for the ultimate rustic retreat without getting your hands too dirty. Blackberry Farm Walland, Tennessee . This luxurious Rocky Top retreat is just 25 minutes from Knoxville. The 4,200-acre Relais & Châteaux member since 1994 is located in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains, and recently ranked as the No. 1 hotel in the United States and Canada in Travel + Leisure's annual World's Best Awards. Spend a misty Tennessee morning fly fishing or gardening before an afternoon of cheese making, horseback riding, cycling or kayaking. Or you could simply laze the day away on a rocking chair with handcrafted whiskey if that's more your speed. Close out each night in The Barn as Executive Chef Joseph Lenn and his team prepare multicourse menus of ""foothills cuisine"" from the farm's bakery, butcher, creamery and 8,000-square-foot wine cellar. Rates start at $890 a night. Gibb's Farm  Karatu, Tanzania . This working farm built in 1929 is on the slopes of the Ngorongoro Forest Reserve. Explore Tanzania's national parks during the day before retreating to the veranda to watch the African sunset over the sweeping coffee fields from the main farmhouse. The 20 guest cottages are situated on a working dairy and pig farm, and 90% of the food served at Gibb's Farm is grown on the property, whether from the 10-acre organic fruit and vegetable garden or 5-acre flower and herb garden. Even the organic coffee served with breakfast is grown and roasted on site. Relax after an afternoon safari or hike to the nearby waterfall with a floral foot soak, coffee scrub or one of the other healing traditions of the Maasai in The African Living Spa. Or let horticulturist Lazaro Msasi Gwandu take you on a guided tour of the eight formal English gardens. Rates start at $367. Romaneira Quinta dos Sonhos  Cotas, Portugal . You will be hard-pressed to find fault with anything that means ""house of dreams,"" Quinta dos Sonhos, in Portuguese. The nearly 1,000-acre villa estate sits on a vineyard on the banks of the River Douro, a World Heritage Site. Be prepared to completely unplug during your stay at the Relais & Châteaux property as there are no telephones, televisions or even reception. You won't even need to decide what or where you want to eat as the chef decides on the menu daily, and each meal is set on a different part of the estate each day. Bask in the Portuguese sun by the L-shaped pool overlooking the Douro, enjoy a rustic picnic under the olive trees or a boat excursion through the grassy banks before retreating to your guest room for a glass of evening port from one of the old cellars. And for the chocolate lovers, there is a chocolate factory on site for your daily antioxidant fix. Rates start around $670, including meals. Palmlea Farms Lodges and Bures  Labasa, Fiji . When one thinks ""green acres,"" the tropical destination of Fiji probably doesn't spring to mind, but Palmlea Farms nestled on Vanua Levu is a new breed of eco-agritourism. The eco-resort overlooking the spectacular Great Sea Reef operates on solar energy and fresh water from the nearby mountain. They also grow much of their own food on the farm using organic processes, and support local growers and north shore fishermen at The Lodge Restaurant on site. Surfing, snorkeling and lagoon swimming are just some of the aquatic activities to take advantage of during your stay. Or for the more manual labor-inclined, try your hand at farming, learning tropical techniques, or crabbing with a local guide. Rates start at approximately $120, including breakfast. The Farm at Cape Kidnappers  Hawke's Bay, New Zealand . Talk about a cliff-hanger: The 6,000 acre working sheep and cattle farm sits atop green cliffs with breathtaking views of Hawke's Bay. The world-renowned golf course designed by Tom Doak offers another dose of green (or bunkers depending on your handicap). Embrace your own Kiwi sense of adventure rafting, fishing, horseback riding or four-wheel drive along a private beach. The lodge situated in Hawke's Bay Wine Country makes it the perfect getaway to discover the best estates that New Zealand has to offer. Rates start around $910 a night.","Explore these five resorts, where all the roots are planted for the ultimate rustic retreat .

"(CNN) -- Our surroundings are changing rapidly. Against a backdrop of serious concerns about the Eurozone, projecting labor market activity can be particularly tough. However, changing patterns of employment by occupation are largely dominated by longer-term trends rather than the cyclical position of the economy. To understand the natural evolution of the jobs market -- industries and career paths that are becoming extinct versus those that are advancing through a process of natural selection -- the jobs landscape needs to be viewed in the context of the most influential macro-trends. Below are some of the careers that are thriving and dying due to the changing technological, economic, social and business landscape. Dying careers . Postal service workers (including sorters, clerks and mail carriers) The industry has had a tough time since the widespread adoption of email stole a large part of its consumer and business market share. Increased communication via phone and cloud computing is another contributory factor, but the main reason for the decline is that mail sorting is becoming automated, with robots replacing people. In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has predicted a further 30% decline in the occupation by 2018. In fact, three of the top 10 occupations with the highest projected declines are a type of postal service worker. The U.S. service has already lost $11.6 billion this fiscal year. According to another report by Accenture research, from 2008 - 2009 Poste Italiane registered a 9.9% drop in its postal product volume in response to the increasing digitalization of mail. The amount of volume decline clearly made it more difficult to run a profitable business and will make it even more difficult in the future. Office and administrative workers (particularly data entry clerks) Revolutions in technology also continue to cause profound changes in the office and administrative market. Although it was hard-hit by the recession, the industry had in fact already been declining for years due to technological advancement boosting productivity and operational efficiency. Word processing, voicemail and the internet all make it easier for skilled professionals to do clerical work themselves. With companies focused on cutting costs, secretaries and file clerks are no longer in demand. In the U.S. alone, word processors and typists are slated to lose 13,200 jobs by 2020 and data entry clerks are expected to lose 15,900 according to the BLS. The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training also estimated demand for occupations such as office clerks will decline by an average one million jobs by 2020 across Europe. Manufacturing assembly jobs . In many developed economies manufacturing assembly jobs that require modest training and only a secondary school education are a thing of the past. In the Unied Kingdom specifically, 400,000 manual jobs are forecast to disappear before 2020, reducing the combined employment share of these occupations from 18% to 16%. However, the industry does need people to manage the technology now running automated processes. As a result, higher skilled occupations, including managers, professionals and associate professional roles are projected to rise significantly by 2020. Telemarketing and door-to-door sales . This type of sales is no longer efficient and has been replaced with internet and television advertising. In the United States, for example, door-to-door sales and telemarketer positions are expected to decline 15% and 11% respectively by 2018. Thriving careers . Data scientists . According to IBM, every day we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data â€” so much that 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone. This data comes from everywhere: sensors used to gather climate information, posts to social media sites, digital pictures and videos, purchase transaction records, mobile phone GPS signals and so on. With technological innovation meaning that more data is now shared and stored by businesses, it follows that the result of a data explosion -- combined with a need to leverage the data effectively to drive a competitive edge -- creates its own tidal wave in the jobs market. Data and information management is a huge growth area. But it's not just data management creating new job opportunities, its gathering, analyzing, storing and securing the data as well. Research and design managers, particularly in engineering . Increased automation is the result of a need to reduce cost, which in turn is driven by a company's need to become more competitive and grow market share -- a trend accelerated by pressures felt by the difficult economic situation. These improved efficiencies support profitability and overall business growth, which spur recruitment demands. In the United Kingdom alone, manufacturing output growth is projected to average around 2.5% per annum, with particular growth in R&D-related industries, such as parts of chemicals and engineering. Computer programmers and network administrators . One key misperception among industry watchers is that technology advancements results largely in the death of career opportunities. This is simply not the case. Instead of killing jobs, technological advances are changing the nature of the roles available. Computer programmers and network administrators are just two examples of roles in the IT sector that are seeing significant growth across the globe. Medical assistants . There have been significant changes in the management of healthcare services, both in the United States and across Europe. As a result, more middle management positions have become available. In America, the Department of Labor projects 162,900 new positions will be added before 2018. In Europe in particular there is also likely to be significant growth in community and clinical nursing roles. Where to go from here . The key to navigating this evolving jobs market is to follow the premise of Darwin's own theory of evolution and be as versatile and adaptable as possible while career paths are naturally selected to align with the changing surroundings. By monitoring and understanding the major trends that are affecting our global economy, our businesses and our lives, savvy industry watchers are able to shape their skill set and career in line with the key influences driving long-term opportunities. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alan Townsend.","Technological advances are changing the jobs market, says Alan Townsend .

"(WIRED) -- More and more schools are jumping on the digital bandwagon and adopting iPads for daily use in the classroom. Apple's education-related announcements last week will no doubt bolster the trend, making faculty tools and student textbooks more engaging and accessible. But today another data point emerged, demonstrating that the iPad can be a valuable asset in education. In a partnership with Apple, textbook publishers Houghton Mifflin Harcourt performed a pilot study using an iPad text for Algebra 1 courses, and found that 20% more students (78% compared to 59%) scored 'Proficient' or 'Advanced' in subject comprehension when using tablets rather than paper textbook counterparts. The study was conducted at a Riverside, California, middle school from Spring 2010 to Spring 2011 using HMH's Fuse: Algebra I app. Similar pilot courses and iPad programs have cropped up all over the country, primarily in private and boarding schools, and select universities. In the public school sector, more than 600 school districts have adopted a 1:1 iPad program. The iPad seems to help students better connect with the content at hand. ""Students' interaction with the device was more personal. You could tell students were more engaged,"" said Coleman Kells, principal of Amelia Earhart Middle School. ""Using the iPad was more normal, more understandable for them."" Tablets could be less daunting to students, too. Marita Scarfi, CEO of digital-focused marketing agency Organic, says that moving textbooks to mobile devices will reinvent learning. ""Now you don't know if a book is super huge and formidable,"" Scarfi says. ""Learning can be done in snackable chunks. It could be reoriented."" Another study centered on an iPad game, Motion Math, has shown that the iPad can help with fundamental math skills. Fifth graders who regularly played the game for 20 minutes per day over a five-day period increased their test scores by 15% on average (you can check out more about this study on Wired's GeekDad). Digital textbooks haven't enjoyed the same success as app-based learning tools thus far, however. E-textbooks have been a transitional product, Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps wrote in a November 2011 report. They make up less than 3 percent of textbook sales, and don't offer much over their paperbound counterparts. Apple's new and updated products — iTunes U (an app-based hub for virtual classrooma), as well as iBooks 2, the iBookstore and iBooks Author — should help provide solutions for educators looking to provide more engaging experiences than plain, old PDFs, all without the heavy investments required of building apps from scratch. ""With iBooks, learning will be a lot more experiential,"" Scarfi told Wired in an e-mail. iBooks also have the potential to ease some of the financial burden of schools, as ebooks could save on textbook costs. ""Other benefits include more timely and relevant content, and the ability for students to interact and share this content with ease. Textbooks will now become social in a variety of ways."" However, even if e-book prices themselves won't break the bank, iPads are still a $500-plus investment per tablet. Funding is still a problem, particularly for public schools. Luckily, there are sites like DonorsChoose.org that can help offload the costs from teachers and school districts. And a program called SA500 Kids is helping to accelerate funding for technology resource requests on the site. Thus far, iPad requests have been fairly low: SA500 Kids has funded 24 iPad-based project requests since Nov. 25. Currently there are 418 iPad-related requests on DonorsChoose, out of the 20,000 projects listed on the site. When the next iPad debuts, if Apple goes with a similar pricing scheme as it has with the iPhone — as rumored — then schools will be able to pick up iPads on the cheap and really be able to utilize the company's new education related products. But regardless, it looks like the iPad is starting to do an impressive job of improving the education space. And now that publishers and instructors have these iBooks tools at their disposal, students can continue to reap the benefits of increased understanding and greater participation.

"New York (CNN) -- A 29-year-old motorcyclist has been charged with gang assault and other charges in connection with the beating of an SUV driver in a high-profile case caught on video last week, a law enforcement source told CNN on Monday. Craig Wright ""hit (driver Alexian) Lien numerous times with his fists, feet, and helmet after forcibly removing Lien from his SUV,"" the source added. He is the latest person to be charged in the case that involved a group of motorcyclists on Manhattan's West Side Highway and Lien, who was driving a Range Rover along with his wife and small child. Wright, who was arrested at his home in Brooklyn, also was charged with assault and unlawful imprisonment and was to be arraigned Monday night. He is also seen on a video punching through the window of the SUV, the source said. The video was taken with an iPad by someone who was at the scene of the attack. The source didn't say whether the person who shot the video was a biker or a bystander. The source said Wright's license tag was visible in the video -- which hasn't been released to the media -- and his uncle identified him for authorities. In March, Wright pleaded guilty to driving with a suspended license, a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office said. It is unclear whether he was driving with a suspended license at the time of the SUV incident. He was also convicted in Virginia in 2005 for reckless driving. One of the other bikers has been charged with the felonies of first-degree assault and gang assault. The lawyer for Reginald Chance, who was captured on video smashing his shiny helmet into an SUV window, concedes his client ""overreacted,"" but claims his client did not take part in beating the driver. One video, taken from a rider's helmet camera, shows bikers -- apparently angered when Lien's SUV collided with a biker who slowed abruptly -- pursuing the vehicle until they could surround it and beat on the windows. Other photos show Lien beaten bloody and lying on the pavement. New York police: Bikers stomped on SUV driver . Defense lawyer Gregory Watts said it's ""a given"" that Chance hit the SUV's window with his helmet. But he said Chance then walked away. He claimed Chance was knocked off his motorcycle by Lien's SUV after bikers had surrounded the vehicle earlier. ""The law does permit someone who is a victim of an accident to at least attempt to get the identification of the motorist,"" Watts said. ""My client obviously overreacted in that manner, but he is not this thug assaulting someone who's harmless, contrary to the public opinion that's being put out there."" Police said Chance's license was suspended in June for six months. Defenders of the bikers, including the relatives of one biker who was critically injured, have criticized Lien for driving through the crowd of motorcycles. Investigation involves off-duty cops . At least two off-duty undercover police officers who were riding with the motorcyclists that day are being questioned by internal affairs, a law enforcement official told CNN. One of the officers reportedly told internal affairs investigators he didn't come forward for four days because he was reportedly afraid his cover would be blown. The officer has been assigned to desk duty. He has hired a lawyer, sources told CNN. The officer was riding with his motorcycle club when the incident occurred and saw much of the confrontation, a law enforcement source told CNN on Friday. Off-duty police officer among bikers who saw SUV driver beaten . A bump on a tire . Lien, with his wife and their 2-year-old daughter, was driving his Range Rover back from a wedding anniversary celebration. The helmet video seized by police shows dozens of bikers swarming past him on Manhattan's West Side Highway. One motorcycle quickly slowed down in front of Lien, who bumped its rear tire, slightly injuring rider Christopher Cruz. Lien pulled to a stop, and angry bikers surrounded his vehicle, hitting it and spiking its tires, police said. Lien stepped on the gas, plowing into three more bikers, including Edwin Mieses, whose wife says he is paralyzed. The video shows the Range Rover stopping again -- long enough for a biker to open the door -- and Lien then driving away until traffic forced him to the final stop. Police say the subsequent beating included kicks to Lien's head and body as he lay on the highway. Injuries to SUV driver, biker . Lien suffered two black eyes and cuts on his face and side, requiring stitches, a police detective's criminal complaint said. His wife and daughter were unharmed. Mieses' family, meanwhile, has said he was paralyzed and needs a ventilator to breathe in the hospital. They claim Mieses was trying to help Lien. Chance's lawyer said prosecutors should conduct a grand jury investigation of Lien for hitting Mieses and Chance with the SUV. Criminal case . Chance was ordered held on $75,000 bond Sunday. Assistant District Attorney Samantha Turino said Chance's license had been suspended and he should not have been driving. She said Chance's arrest record includes a marijuana charge in 2013 and attempted criminal possession of a weapon in 2006. Christopher Cruz, 28, who police say is the biker who slowed in front of Lien, was charged with reckless driving and other misdemeanors. He was released on bond. His lawyer, H. Benjamin Perez, said, ""He never tried to assault him in any way. And he does not know any of the other motorcyclists who were involved in this beating."" Another biker, Robert Sims, is accused of stomping on Lien. He surrendered on Friday on charges of attempted assault and gang assault. Opinion: In attack, can bikers get a fair shake? CNN's Steve Almasy wrote from Atlanta; CNN's Susan Candiotti, Chris Welch and Margaret Conley reported from New York; CNN's David Simpson, Tom Watkins and Greg Botelho reported from Atlanta.","Suspect charged with gang assault, unlawful imprisonment .

"(CNN) -- Closed courtrooms. No laptops, phones or Wi-Fi. Bathrooms closed off by marshals. The corruption trial of former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin cranks up Monday with a federal judge imposing tough rules on spectators and reporters during jury selection. In an order issued last week, U.S. District Judge Helen Berrigan imposed those restrictions because of concerns that courtroom rules ""may not be respected"" by some unnamed miscreants. Nagin's pleas for federal help for his flooded city caught the nation's attention in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Now out of office, he's pleaded not guilty to federal charges of bribery, money laundering, fraud and filing false tax returns. Prosecutors accused him of being at the center of ""a bribery and kickback scheme"" in which he allegedly received checks, cash, wire transfers, personal services and free travel from businessmen seeking contracts and favorable treatment from the city. After preliminary questioning, some jurors will be quizzed behind closed doors, Berrigan ordered. Electronic devices have been barred from the courtroom, and the nearby restrooms on the fifth floor of the courthouse ""will be closed to all members of the media and public during voir dire proceedings,"" she wrote. Those restrictions may be lifted ""after the jury is sworn and in the event the court regains confidence that there will be full compliance with its orders by the media and public,"" she added. Prosecutors accuse Nagin of taking more than $200,000 in bribes, while his family members allegedly received a vacation in Hawaii; first-class airfare to Jamaica; private jet travel and a limousine for New York City; and cellular phone service. In exchange, businesses that coughed up cash for Nagin and his family won more than $5 million in city contracts, according to an indictment brought in January 2013. Two businessmen named in the charges have pleaded guilty to making payoffs and are cooperating with prosecutors. A third was found guilty of bribing two Nagin staffers, while another admitted to paying kickbacks to the sheriff of nearby Plaquemines Parish after winning a project management contract there. But Ashleigh Merchant, a Georgia defense lawyer and legal observer, told CNN, ""Corruption is still very hard to prove."" In most businesses, Merchant said, ""You're going to give the work to who you know, who you trust, who you perhaps took a family vacation with. The issue is going to be the testimony of those people, as to whether or not they expected to get something back in return for taking the family on vacation."" And if prosecutors can show that Nagin promised city business in exchange for their favors, ""Then he's done,"" she said. Nagin sought to have the charges dismissed in October after another federal judge blasted what he called the ""grotesque"" misconduct of prosecutors in the post-Katrina shootings of unarmed civilians by police at the Danziger Bridge. The judge tossed out the convictions of five cashiered cops after ruling that members of the U.S. attorney's office tainted their 2011 trial by anonymously posting ""egregious and inflammatory"" comments at online news sites. Nagin argued that he was the target of the same underground effort, citing ""a continuum of perjorative statements and demeaning racial epithets"" aimed at him. The U.S. attorney's office said none of the prosecutors involved in the Danziger Bridge case played a role in the Nagin investigation, and Berrigan denied Nagin's motion. The onetime cable-television executive was elected mayor in 2002 and was in office when the massive Katrina slammed ashore just east of New Orleans on August 29, 2005. The storm flooded more than three-fourths of the low-lying city and left more than 1,800 dead, most of them in across Louisiana. Supporters credited Nagin's sometimes-profane demands for aid from Washington with helping reveal the botched federal response to the storm -- a fiasco that embarrassed the George W. Bush administration and led to billions of federal dollars being poured into Gulf Coast reconstruction efforts. But he also had his critics: A congressional committee criticized him for delaying evacuation orders, and his frantic description of post-storm New Orleans as a violent wasteland with up to 10,000 dead turned out to be greatly exaggerated. As he sought re-election in 2006, with much of the city's African-American population displaced by storm damage, he was blasted for insisting that New Orleans would remain a ""chocolate"" city. He won a second term despite the controversies, but left office in mid-2010 with approval ratings in the cellar. Afterward, he told CNN his career in public office was over: ""I have given my pound of flesh,"" he said.","Tight rules for public as jury selection starts for ex-New Orleans mayor .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama does not foresee a scenario of ""American boots on the ground in Syria,"" telling reporters Friday that it would not be good for the United States or for that county. ""As a general rule, I don't rule things out as commander-in-chief because circumstances change,"" Obama said during a joint news conference with President Laura Chinchilla of Costa Rica, where the president stopped during a three-day visit to the region. ""...Having said that, I do not foresee a scenario in which boots on the ground in Syria, American boots on the ground in Syria, would be good for America or be good for Syria."" Obama said he has consulted with leaders in the region, who want to see stability return to Syria, and ""they agree with that assessment."" Even so, the president said that if the United States confirms the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government against its people, ""that's a game changer for us."" He did not elaborate on what steps would be taken, repeating as he has said previously that the United States would wait until it has more details of evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria before making any decision on whether to alter strategy. ""We have evidence that chemical weapons have been used. We don't know when, where or how they were used,"" Obama said. But in recent days, the Pentagon has stepped up planning for potential military intervention in Syria, which would most likely include the use of fighter jets and cruise missiles, two administration officials, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, told CNN. For now, Obama said, the United States is continuing its investigation, and working with its Middle East and European allies. The president's comments follow a number of claims in recent weeks that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons against its people in a more than 2-year-old civil war. The United Nations estimates some 70,000 people have died in the fighting. Syria had denied the use of chemical weapons, accusing the United States of manipulating evidence to pressure President Bashar al-Assad to step down. Obama has been under fire by some in the United States, including U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, for not taking a tougher stand with Syria. The president said the United States is ""not waiting."" ""We are not standing by,"" he said, adding that the United States has been the largest contributor of humanitarian aid and nonlethal aid to the opposition. ""We are actively engaged on a day-to-day basis to deal with this crisis to restore a Syria that is respectful of the rights and aspirations of the Syrian people."" In addition to Syria's possible use of chemical weapons against rebels, another concern is that parts of the government's stockpile of chemical weapons -- which analysts believe is one of the world's largest and includes sarin, mustard and VX gases -- could end up, if they haven't already, in others' hands.

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno is expected to ""categorically deny"" allegations Monday that she gave Hoboken's Mayor an ultimatum regarding Superstorm Sandy recovery aid. Guadagno's denial flies in the face of claims made by Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer, who said Sunday that Guadagno told her to support a redevelopment project backed by Christie or lose Sandy recovery funds. Zimmer also connected Christie to the threat, saying that Guadagno told her the message was coming directly from Christie. Appearing on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Zimmer said, ""She said that to me -- is that this is a direct message from the Governor,"" Zimmer said, referring to Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, who Zimmer said approached her in a parking lot in May to deliver the message. Hoboken mayor: 'It's true' Christie administration withheld Sandy funds . The alleged incident happened last May after Guadagno toured a grocery store that had reopened after suffering $10 million in flooding damage from Sandy. The lieutenant governor recalls having a conversation with Zimmer that day, but says she remembers Zimmer arguing that Sandy recovery aid and redevelopment were the same issue, according to the source close to Guadagno, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ""Kim remembers in their conversation that she was talking about redevelopment and making investments in Hoboken. She remembers Zimmer pressing Kim for money for Sandy. Kim remembers saying you can't tie the two together,"" the source said. ""And she remembers Zimmer continuing to press and showing her a map of the city and pressing for aid for Sandy."" Catching up with the Christie scandal . Guadagno remembers it as a ""friendly conversation,"" the source said. ""Zimmer was laser-focused on getting Hoboken money for Sandy recovery and that is not the role Kim Guadagno plays in the administration,"" the source said. She remembers telling Zimmer that the administration would like to do more to redevelop Hoboken, but she doesn't recall talking to her specifically about The Rockefeller Group project. But the source said Guadagno, a veteran prosecutor and former county sheriff, is still going through her records, preparing for a possible subpoena. In remarks Monday morning -- at a volunteer event in Union Beach, New Jersey honoring the Martin Luther King Jr. National Day of Service -- Guadagno is expected to make the point that, ""My job in the governor's office is to oversee redevelopment and reinvestment in New Jersey,"" the source said. In fact, a governor's directive prevents Guadagno from working on the Sandy recovery efforts because she was personally affected by the superstorm -- her home in Monmouth Beach was damaged by the storm, the source said. She was at the Hoboken grocery store in her role as an advocate for the state's business community. ""Kim can't talk about Sandy,"" the source said. ""She can't do it."" And Guadagno twice returned to Hoboken after that May visit -- once spending more than two hours touring farmers' markets with Zimmer -- and the Hoboken mayor never brought up the May conversation or indicated that it had upset her, the source said. Zimmer's comments Saturday and Sunday are a change from what she told CNN on January 11. She said then that while she wondered whether Sandy aid funds were being withheld because she didn't endorse the governor's re-election, she concluded that ""I don't think that's the case."" ""I don't think it was retaliation and I don't have any reason to think it's retaliation, but I'm not satisfied with the amount of money I've gotten so far,"" Zimmer told CNN then. She did not mention her concerns about the redevelopment project. CNN""s Leigh Ann Caldwell contributed to this report .","New: New Jersey Lt. Gov.

"(CNN) -- There is ""no credible evidence"" to support a claim that the British military was involved in the deaths of Princess Diana, her boyfriend and their driver, according to London's Metropolitan Police. The allegation first surfaced in August, roughly 16 years after the woman who would now be a royal grandmother died in a Paris car crash. Officers were tasked with looking into whether there was any truth to it. ""Every reasonable line of enquiry was objectively pursued in order to fully evaluate any potential evidence,"" police said in a statement released overnight Monday. ""The final conclusion is that whilst there is a possibility the alleged comments in relation to the SAS's involvement in the deaths may have been made, there is no credible evidence to support a theory that such claims had any basis in fact."" SAS is short for Britain's elite Special Air Service. Wildly popular in life and death, Diana died on August 31, 1997, after the car she was riding in slammed into a pillar in a Paris overpass. Her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul, also died. Investigators concluded that Paul was drunk and speeding when the accident occurred, and despite at least three inquiries -- including a lengthy London police inquiry that poured cold water on all forms of conspiracy theories in Diana's death -- whispers of collusion and cover-up have persisted. Rare photo of teenage Diana sold . The latest claim, published by Press Association, the Sunday People newspaper and other British media outlets, alleged that members of Britain's elite SAS commando unit were involved in assassinating Diana. The claim appears to have been sent first to military authorities and then to London police by the parents-in-law of a British special forces sniper after his marriage had fallen apart, according to an article on the website of the Sunday People newspaper. It did not offer a source for its reporting, but the paper indicated that the parents were questioning the integrity of the soldier, who had testified in another soldier's court-martial. Sunday People said it had seen a seven-page handwritten letter by the in-laws alleging that the soldier, whom the newspaper did not name, had boasted to his wife that the commando unit was behind the deaths. Neither the Sunday People piece nor an earlier version carried by Press Association offered details of the claimed involvement by soldiers in the deaths. The princess left behind her two children, Prince William, whose wife recently gave birth to Diana's first grandchild, and Prince Harry. Some 2.5 billion people around the world watched Diana's funeral. Princess Diana's favorite fairytale dress could be yours .

Dubai-based Emirates took the debut prize in 2001, and retained it in 2002, before missing out on the top spot for a decade. Now they're back to make it a hat-trick -- and the company's president, Tim Clark, puts their return to award-winning form down to one thing, ""exteremely hard work."" ""We've got 200 aircraft, 18,000 cabin crew and ground staff,"" he explained, admitting that with 200 aircraft and 18,000 cabin crew and ground staff the company's operations were ""not easy, but you work hard at what you're doing, you deliver to people's expectations, and hopefully exceed those expectations."" Emirates was also named best airline in the Middle East, and won a third award for its in-flight entertainment system. Cathay Pacific's cabin crew were crowned the world's best, while Air Asia took the prize for best low-cost airline. Japan's ANA won a new award for cabin cleanliness, as well as receiving a five-star airline rating. John Slosar, CEO of Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific said the win was recognition for the company's ""fabulous team."" ""We work very hard to make sure it's all about the team, not about individuals. We teach our crew not to just follow the rules, but to express themselves through their work, to offer service straight from the heart."" Test your knowledge of airline liveries .

"(CNN) -- A shortage of lethal injection chemicals has contributed to declining use of capital punishment in the United States with a new report on Thursday noting only 39 executions this year. It is only the second time in the past two decades the annual number of inmates put to death has dropped below 40. The total represents a 10 percent reduction from last year. No further executions are scheduled in 2013. ""Twenty years ago, use of the death penalty was increasing. Now it is declining by almost every measure,"" said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, and the author of the report. ""The recurrent problems of the death penalty have made its application rare, isolated, and often delayed for decades. More states will likely reconsider the wisdom of retaining this expensive and ineffectual practice."" The nonprofit organization provides accurate figures and a range of analysis, but opposes use of the death penalty. Lethal injection in nine states . While the annual number of executions and death sentences continues to drop nationally overall, it remains a legally and socially acceptable form of justice for aggravated murder in 32 states. But just nine states conducted lethal injections this year, and two -- Texas with 16 and Florida with 7 -- accounted for nearly 60 percent of the total. Texas is among the active death-penalty states scrambling to find new lethal injection protocols after European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions. Among them is Danish-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital, the most commonly used -- either as a single drug, or in combination with others -- to execute prisoners. New drug combinations . States have been forced to try new drug combinations or go to loosely regulated compounding pharmacies that manufacturer variations of the drugs banned by the larger companies, according to an investigation last month by CNN's Deborah Feyerick. A pending lawsuit against Texas filed by several death row inmates and their supporters alleges the state corrections department falsified a prescription for pentobarbital using an alias. Until recently, most states relied on a three-drug ""cocktail,"" but many jurisdictions now use a single dose or a two-drug combination. Various state and federal courts have postponed some planned executions until issues surrounding the new protocols are resolved. Every execution this year relied on pentobarbital, except in Florida, which used midazolam hydrochloride -- a drug applied for the first time in human lethal injections. And Missouri was prepared to inject a single dose of the anesthetic propofol for its two recent executions, until Gov. Jay Nixon halted its application. The European Union had threatened to limit export of the widely used drug for other purposes if the state had proceeded. The two inmates were separately put to death in recent weeks using pentobarbital instead. First woman executed . Among the high-profile capital cases this year involved Kimberly McCarthy, the first woman executed in the United States in three years. The former Dallas-area resident was convicted of murdering her neighbor, and in June became the state's 500th prisoner to die at the hands of the government since 1976, when the Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume. So far, 1,359 people have been put to death across the country since that time, using lethal injection, electrocution, gas chamber, hanging, and firing squad. That includes three federal prisoners. Spared for now was Georgia inmate Warren Hill, whose attorneys say he is mentally disabled. Courts earlier this year stayed three separate execution dates, one with just minutes to spare. The Supreme Court in March will hold oral arguments and decide whether the Florida scheme for identifying mentally disabled defendants in capital cases violates previous standards established by the high court. Freddie Lee Hall and an accomplice were convicted of the 1978 murders of a pregnant 21-year-old woman and a sheriff's deputy in separate store robberies, both on the same day. His lawyers say the death row inmate has an IQ of 60. In Missouri, Reginald Griffin was freed in October and his sentence thrown out after the state high court found the trial prosecution withheld critical evidence that may have implicated another prisoner in a jailhouse murder. He became the 143rd person exonerated from death row in the past 40 years. Maryland abolishes death penalty . Maryland became the sixth state in as many years to abolish its death penalty, joining Connecticut, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, and New Mexico. Eighteen other states have previously done so. Attorney General Eric Holder faces a tough decision in coming months: whether to seek the death penalty in federal court for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzokhar Tsarnaev. Across the country, capital sentences remain at historic lows, with just 79 so far this year. They have declined in number by 75 percent from 1996, said the report, when 315 people were put on death row. With the death penalty declining and recent polls showing a corresponding drop in public support, some legal analysts wonder if the Supreme Court is prepared in coming years to take another look at the issue's overall constitutionality -- whether capital punishment in the 21st century represents ""cruel and unusual punishment."" No sign of Supreme Court review . The justices in most cases continue to deny most requests for stays of executions, usually without any comment, or a breakdown of which members of the nine-member bench might have granted such a delay. ""It certainly seems that it merits another day in court after 40 years,"" said Evan Mandery, a law professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and author of the new book ""A Wild Justice: The Death and Resurrection of Capital Punishment in America."" ""There are a lot of reasons to think that (moderate-conservative) Justice Anthony Kennedy's vote is up for grabs and his mind is open on this question. So I don't think the outcome of a case would be predetermined one way or another."" But there is no sign such a monumental legal and social review by the nation's highest court will be coming soon.","Shortage of lethal injection chemicals contributes to drop in capital punishment .
The number of executions falls below 40, off 10 percent from last year .
Nine states executed inmates in 2013 with Texas and Florida accounting for most .

"(CNN) -- In Tuesday night's State of the Union address, President Obama is expected to focus on the crisis of widening inequality in America. This is good. And it's no surprise. Over the last few years, he has tried to draw attention to the decimation of the middle class over recent decades. He's explained the scope of the problem -- that the severity of today's inequality is akin to what preceded the Great Depression. He's adopted a catchphrase -- prosperity from the ""middle out"" -- and forced Republicans to talk about the issue. And he's proposed policies to address it. But in his SOTU speech, and in the bigger scope of his presidency, Obama must do more than unfurl a list of policy remedies. He first has to acknowledge and then reckon with the conflicting emotions Americans have about ""falling behind."" To be clear, policy matters. Raising the federal minimum wage would be an effective way to lift people out of poverty. Doing what New York's new mayor, Bill de Blasio, proposes -- raising taxes on the highest earners to pay for universal pre-K -- would help alleviate the effects of wage stagnation and wealth concentration. But outside the reliably liberal precincts of cities like New York, most people aren't ready to jump straight to policy fixes. Something blocks them -- a set of stories Americans have learned to tell themselves about success and struggle. These self-scripts influence the entire inequality debate: . -- If I'm struggling, it's my own fault (and complaining about it is for losers). -- I may be struggling, but I work hard and I don't want people who don't work hard as I do to get handouts. -- If someone else is getting rich, it's just sour grapes for me to complain that they have too much. It's unbecoming, maybe even un-American. -- I may be struggling, but there's nothing to be done -- it's out of my control, and I don't trust anyone, especially government, to help me. I'm on my own. To point out these self-scripts isn't to validate divisive right-wing rhetoric about ""makers and takers,"" or the over-the-top comments by a prominent venture capitalist arguing that critiques of the 1% feel like Nazi persecution of Jews. It's simply to describe a political and psychological reality. Millions of Americans have internalized these beliefs, which are woven into our culture and go back at least as far as the Depression. Each script has an emotional core: shame, pride, inadequacy, helplessness. And so before he gets to the minimum wage or any other proposal, Obama would do well to speak directly to such emotions and neutralize them with a set of counter-scripts. He's got to say things like: . ""If you feel the middle class has fallen out of reach and you need help, it's not because you are a lazy moocher. It's because sometimes we all need help, and there is no shame in that."" ""There's no substitute for hard work and grit. But some of the hardest working people in America are poor or barely hanging on to the middle class. We've got to resist the temptation to kick the guy one rung below us on the ladder just to make us feel like we're climbing...."" ""Envy is an ugly thing. But so is bullying. And when people use words like ""socialist"" or ""class warfare"" to shut down a conversation about whether our wealthiest citizens owe more to the society that helped to create their wealth, well, that's bullying..."" ""Franklin Roosevelt told us we have nothing to fear but fear itself. In this age, nothing breeds helplessness like believing you are helpless. We can turn this around together -- if we remember no man is an island and no community can improve its lot without using government wisely and well."" I'm not calling for Obama to channel former President Bill Clinton and conspicuously ""feel our pain."" Obama just has to be Obama -- the author who acutely sensed and articulated the cross currents of ambition and anxiety around him; the organizer who could navigate the unspoken tensions of identity that influence politics. Obama knows well that before the head can engage on a complex issue, the heart must be acknowledged and its pain and fear must be named. Whether Obama can get House Republicans to take action on inequality is not a matter of his willpower or assertiveness; the most forceful president cannot force Congress to enact a thing. What Obama can do is build public pressure on Congress to act. And the best way he can do that is to make more people feel truly heard. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Liu.","Eric Liu: President Obama must do more than list policy fixes for inequality at SOTU .
Liu: He needs to reckon with those who have mixed emotions about ""falling behind""
He says the heart must be acknowledged and its pain and fear must be named .
Liu: Obama must tell those who feel shame for being poor to do away with self-blame ."
"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal will miss the U.S. Open after the reigning champion couldn't recover in time from a right wrist injury. The world No. 2 injured his wrist after Wimbledon and pulled out of the recent Masters events in Toronto and Cincinnati. Due to make an announcement over the weekend about his participation at Flushing Meadows, that decision was pushed back to Monday and the Spaniard's fans were ultimately left disappointed with the outcome. ""I am very sorry to announce I won't be able to play at this year's U.S. Open,"" the 28-year-old announced on his Facebook page. ""I am sure you understand that it is a very tough moment for me since it is a tournament I love and where I have great memories from fans, the night matches, so many things. ""(There is) not much more I can do right now, other than accept the situation and, as always in my case, work hard in order to be able to compete at the highest level once I am back."" It's not the first time Nadal won't be able to defend a grand slam title. He also skipped Wimbledon in 2009, the year after his memorable triumph over Roger Federer at the All England Club, when his knees were the issue. Injuries have been an ever present in the 14-time grand slam winner's career, with those knees the biggest culprit. But a hamstring injury hindered Nadal at the 2011 Australian Open -- when he was on the verge of capturing a fourth consecutive grand slam titles -- and in Melbourne seven months ago, back pain meant he was unable to perform at his best in the finale versus Stan Wawrinka. His absence means Federer will be bumped up to No. 2 in the seedings, only behind Novak Djokovic. Federer has been the hottest player this summer, reaching the final in Toronto and winning Cincinnati, and without his nemesis at the U.S. Open, the Swiss' chances of landing a record-extending 18th major have now improved. Nadal is the highest profile casualty of the U.S. Open, though 2009 champion Juan Martin del Potro also withdrew with a wrist injury. The tournament begins next Monday.","Rafael Nadal says he will miss the U.S. Open because of a wrist injury .

"Enoosaen, Kenya (CNN) -- When she was 14 years old, Kakenya Ntaiya entered the cow pen behind her home with an elderly woman carrying a rusty knife. As a crowd from her Maasai village looked on, Ntaiya sat down, lifted her skirt and opened her legs. The woman grabbed Ntaiya's most intimate body parts and, in just moments, cut them out. ""It (was) really painful. I fainted,"" recalled Ntaiya, now 34. ""You're not supposed to cry."" For generations, this ceremony was a rite of passage for every Maasai girl, some as young as 10; soon afterward, they would marry and drop out of school. About 140 million girls and women worldwide have been affected by female genital mutilation, also known as female circumcision. The procedure is commonly based on religious and cultural beliefs, including efforts to prevent premarital sex and marital infidelity. While female circumcision and child marriage are now illegal in Kenya -- new laws banning genital mutilation have contributed to a decline in the practice -- officials acknowledge that they still go on, especially in rural tribal areas. Despite free primary education being mandated 10 years ago by the Kenyan government, educating girls is still not a priority for the Maasai culture. According to the Kenyan government, only 11% of Maasai girls in Kenya finish primary school. ""It means the end of their dreams of whatever they want to become in life,"" Ntaiya said. But when Ntaiya endured the painful ritual in 1993, she had a plan. She negotiated a deal with her father, threatening to run away unless he promised she could finish high school after the ceremony. ""I really liked going to school,"" she said. ""I knew that once I went through the cutting, I was going to be married off. And my dream of becoming a teacher was going to end."" Dreams like Ntaiya's weren't the norm in Enoosaen, a small village in western Kenya. Engaged at age 5, Ntaiya spent her childhood learning the skills she would need to be a good Maasai wife. But her mother encouraged her children to strive for a better life, and Ntaiya heeded her advice, postponing the coming-of-age ritual as long as she could. When her father finally insisted, she took her stand. Ntaiya's bold move paid off. She excelled in high school and earned a college scholarship in the United States. Her community held a fundraiser to raise money for her airfare, and in exchange, she promised to return and help the village. Over the next decade, Ntaiya would earn her degree, a job at the United Nations and eventually a doctorate in education. But she never forgot the vow she made to village elders. In 2009, she opened the first primary school for girls in her village, the Kakenya Center for Excellence. Today, Ntaiya is helping more than 150 girls receive the education and opportunities that she had to sacrifice so much to attain. The Kakenya Center for Excellence started as a traditional day school, but now the students, who range from fourth to eighth grade, live at the school. This spares the girls from having to walk miles back and forth, which puts them at risk of being sexually assaulted, a common problem in rural African communities. It also ensures the girls don't spend all their free time doing household chores. ""Now, they can focus on their studies -- and on being kids,"" Ntaiya said. ""It's the only way you can give a girl child a chance to excel."" Students receive three meals a day as well as uniforms, books and tutoring. There are also extracurricular activities such as student council, debate and soccer. Class sizes are small -- many schools in Kenya are extremely overcrowded -- and the girls have more chances to participate. With these opportunities and the individual attention they receive, the girls are inspired to start dreaming big. ""They want to become doctors, pilots, lawyers,"" Ntaiya said. ""It's exciting to see that."" Just 4 years old, the school already ranks among the top in its district. ""Fathers are now saying, 'My daughter could do better than my son,' "" Ntaiya said. As a public school, the Kakenya Center for Excellence receives some financial support from the Kenyan government. But the majority of the school's expenses are paid for by Ntaiya's U.S.-based nonprofit. While families are asked to contribute to cover the cost of the girls' meals, an expense that can be paid in maize or beans, Ntaiya covers the costs of any students who cannot pay. Each year, more than 100 girls apply for approximately 30 spots available in each new class. Parents who enroll their daughters must agree that they will not be subjected to genital mutilation or early marriage. Many families are willing to accept Ntaiya's terms, and that's the kind of change she was hoping to inspire. It took her years to drum up support for the project, but eventually she persuaded the village elders to donate land for the school. ""It's still quite challenging to push for change. Men are in charge of everything,"" she said. ""But nothing good comes on a silver plate. You have to fight hard."" Chief John Naleke, a village elder, can testify firsthand to Ntaiya's powers of persuasion. As recently as 2006, he claimed there was no need for girls to be educated. But she managed to win him over; he's now an important partner in her efforts. Naleke said Ntaiya's accomplishments and spirit have made her a role model, noting that villagers also respect the fact that she didn't forget her promise. ""We have several sons who have gone to the United States for school. Kakenya is the only one that I can think of that has come back to help us,"" Naleke said. ""What she tells us, it touches us. ... She brought a school and a light and is trying to change old customs to help girls get a new, better life."" In 2011, Ntaiya moved to Nairobi, Kenya's capital, with her husband and two young sons. She spends about half her time in Enoosaen, where she loves to visit with the girls and see them evolve. ""When they start, they are so timid,"" she said. ""(Now) the confidence they have, it's just beyond words. It's the most beautiful thing."" Her nonprofit also runs health and leadership camps that are open to all sixth-grade girls in the village and teach them about female circumcision, child marriage, teen pregnancy and HIV/AIDS. ""We tell them about every right that they have, and we teach them how to speak up,"" Ntaiya said. ""It's about empowering the girls."" In the coming years, Ntaiya plans to expand her school to include lower grades. She also wants to provide tutoring for the students from her first class when they head to high school next year, and she wants to eventually open a career center for them. She hopes that one day the school will serve as a model for girls' education throughout Africa. Ultimately, Ntaiya wants girls to have the opportunity to go as far as their abilities will take them. ""I came back so girls don't have to negotiate like I did to achieve their dreams,"" she said. ""That's why I wake up every morning."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Add Alec Baldwin to the TSA's list of unhappy customers. The outspoken actor took to -- what else? -- Twitter on Monday to slam the Transportation Security Administration after he said his 5-month-old daughter was selected for a pat down while his family went through airport security in the Bahamas. But, as the Twittersphere so helpfully pointed out to Baldwin, he had a couple of his facts mixed up. First, the Bahamas is its own country, and not part of the United States. And second, TSA doesn't operate outside the United States. But Baldwin may just have a point. Lincoln Adderley, a security supervisor at Nassau Airport, said airport authorities use TSA standards because passengers traveling to the United States clear U.S. customs before leaving the islands. Adderley would not confirm that Baldwin's daughter was given a pat down, but said if a minor is selected for additional screening, they get a modified pat down. Baldwin sarcastically thanked those who jumped on his tweet errors Monday -- including movie critic Richard Roeper -- and summed up his point simply: . .

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson was a one-man cottage industry for the legal profession. Michael Jackson shows up for court, late and wearing pajama bottoms, during his 2005 child molestation trial. Two child-molestation investigations (no convictions), two divorces, myriad civil lawsuits over concerts, special performances and soured business deals, near-bankruptcy and the threatened foreclosure of his Neverland ranch kept teams of lawyers busy. Jackson's legal stable included the elite of Los Angeles, California, litigators -- Thomas Mesereau Jr., Mark Geragos and the late Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. Legal foes included Gloria Allred, Larry Feldman and Anthony Pellicano, the convicted ""wiretapper to the stars."" His legal legacy seems destined to live on. Jackson's death at age 50 is likely to be the subject of a coroner's investigation. Also to be determined is who raises Jackson's three children, whether he left a will and whether anyone will challenge it.  Watch how Jackson made and spent his money » . Attorney Allred's thoughts were on the pop music icon's children -- Prince Michael I, Paris and Prince Michael II. ""I am very concerned about the children he leaves behind,"" she said. ""What will happen to them? If the mother relinquished parental rights, then who's to have custody?"" She added that if Jackson left a will, it likely will be challenged in court. Allred filed the complaint with Child Protective Services that resulted, in part, in the 2004 Santa Barbara County grand jury investigation. Jackson was acquitted in June 2005 of child molestation charges after a 14-week media circus of a trial in Santa Maria, California. Prosecutors charged the singer with four counts of lewd conduct with a child younger than 14; one count of attempted lewd conduct; four counts of administering alcohol to facilitate child molestation; and one count of conspiracy to commit child abduction, false imprisonment or extortion. Jackson began the legal battle by giving an impromptu mini-performance for the horde of fans who flocked to his arraignment. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin was there. ""I was standing about 20 feet away from Jackson on the day of his arraignment in Santa Maria when he danced on the top of his car before an adoring crowd. It was one of the most bizarre moments of my journalism career,"" Toobin recalled. Some of the testimony was equally bizarre, as the accusing witness told of being plied with wine -- ""Jesus Juice,"" he said Jackson called it. Jackson became even more of a curiosity when he wore pajama bottoms to court on the day his accuser took the witness stand. He arrived an hour and 40 minutes late, after the judge threatened to revoke his $3 million bail. Former child star Macaulay Culkin was among the more than 130 people who testified at the trial. He disputed testimony from earlier witnesses who claimed they saw Jackson behaving inappropriately with him in the early 1990s. The jury deliberated for 32 hours before clearing Jackson of charges that could have sent him to prison for 20 years. Jackson's defense attorney in that case, Mesereau, told reporters at the time that ""justice was done."" He was in court when his former client died Thursday afternoon. ""I'm in an absolute state of shock,"" Mesereau said. ""He was a very gentle, kind soul who wanted to make the universe a better place. I'm honored to have spent the time with him that I did and to have helped preserve his honor, reputation and freedom."" In a February 2003 broadcast of an unflattering television documentary by British journalist Martin Bashir, Jackson was shown on the program holding hands with the boy who accused him of child molestation. He defended as ""loving"" his practice of letting young boys sleep in his bed. ""He was a great talent but had very poor judgment in the choices he made in his personal life,"" said Allred, who filed her complaint after watching the documentary. ""His choices led to serious accusations against him. His own words were problematic,"" she added. ""There were significant questions about his personal choices, particularly with young children."" California authorities searched Neverland, Jackson's mansion complete with roller coaster and petting zoo, that November. He was in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the time, and flew back to California on a private jet, accompanied by lawyer Geragos. Even that journey, which was surreptitiously taped, resulted in litigation and an undisclosed financial settlement. A decade earlier, prosecutors in Los Angeles declined to file charges in their own 13-month child molestation investigation. A 13-year-old boy complained to social workers that Jackson had molested him over a period of several months in 1993. The boy's father also filed a civil lawsuit, and Jackson's lawyers characterized the allegations as a $20 million extortion attempt. But the case settled out of court, reportedly with Jackson paying millions in damages. The boy later refused to testify in the Los Angeles case, but was among the witnesses during the 2005 trial in Santa Maria. Jackson and his legal team were equally well known in the civil courts. He was sued by more than a dozen people over the past decade. Those suing included former managers, financial advisors, lawyers, business partners -- even a porn producer -- over nonpayment or soured deals. He settled most of the lawsuits out of court. Two marriages -- to Deborah Rowe, his dermatologist's assistant, and Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of the late Elvis Presley -- ended in divorce. Rowe took him to court over their custody and visitation arrangement, but settled for a reported $8.5 million, giving up her parental rights. In recent years, Jackson has also narrowly avoided bankruptcy and foreclosure on his Neverland ranch, which also includes an amusement park, complete with Ferris wheel, and a petting zoo. He sold Neverland last year. He also ""amicably"" settled a legal claim by a son of the King of Bahrain over a failed $10 million recording venture, according to reports in London. In the United States, Jackson was still fighting civil claims by a former publicist, a concert promoter and John Landis, the writer an director of his iconic ""Thriller"" video, according to the Los Angeles Times.","Michael Jackson investigated and tried for molesting boys, never convicted .

"(CNN) -- Kenyans gathered in the nation's capital Saturday for a state funeral honoring Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai, marking a final journey for the first African woman to win the peace prize. Maathai, 71, died last month after a battle with cancer. She was the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004 for her years of environmental conservation. The human rights activist also fought for the empowerment of impoverished communities in the continent. Crowds gathered at the main park in Nairobi for a state service that included President Mwai Kibaki, Prime Minister Raila Odinga and other government officials. Military forces stood guard next to a mounted picture of the activist, which had a small green shrub pinned on it. Nearby, a car carrying her coffin surrounded by green shrubs slowly made its way down a red carpet under police escort. Throngs of citizens quietly walked next to it. In true fashion to her cause, Maathai stated in her will that she did not want a wooden coffin, organizers said. The ceremony at the park included a tree-planting ceremony and interdenominational prayers. The park was a common venue for her protests, including a defiant rally to stop the government from building a high-rise on the site years ago. Following the gathering, close relatives left for a private event at the crematorium. At her request, her remains will be cremated and her ashes interred at a peace institute in the capital, according to the Green Belt Movement she founded. For decades, Maathai has been at the forefront of a tree-planting campaign to stop deforestation and give locals, especially women, access to resources such as firewood for cooking and clean water. The former parliament member was the first woman in East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate degree. She was honored by Time magazine in 2005 as one of 100 most influential people in the world. During her activism work, she was beaten and arrested numerous times, especially during the former regime of President Daniel arap Moi. Known as the Tree Mother of Africa, she launched a campaign that led to the planting of 40 million trees in Kenya. She believed that lack of natural resources causes most conflicts. ""It is evident that many wars are fought over resources which are now becoming increasingly scarce,"" she said on receiving news that she had been awarded the Nobel prize. ""If we conserved our resources better, fighting over them would not occur ... protecting the global environment is directly related to securing peace. Those of us who understand the complex concept of the environment have the burden to act. We must not tire, we must not give up, we must persist."" The first African woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize died weeks before another milestone in the continent she fought for. On Friday, the Nobel Committee awarded the peace prize to three women activists: Liberians Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first African woman elected head of state and Leymah Gbowee, who campaigned for peace during the nation's brutal civil war and anti-government protester Tawakkul Karman of Yemen.","Maathai, 71, died last month after a battle with cancer .

"(CNN) -- An Oklahoma teenager and four of his friends have been formally charged in connection with the slayings of the teen's father and younger brother, authorities said Friday. Police said Thorsten Gunter Rushing, 18, allegedly shot his father, Uwe Rushing, 49, and his 13-year-old brother, Stefan, on January 20 before calling police to report a home invasion in an elaborate ruse involving four of his friends. After allegedly shooting his dad and brother as they watched television, Rushing smothered his brother to death because he was not ""bleeding out fast enough,"" according to an affidavit filed in an Oklahoma state court. From the beginning, police said, the details of the shootings in Lawton did not add up. Initially, Rushing told police that two black men -- one of them armed -- forced their way into the home before Rushing chased them away with a shotgun, police said. Later, the intruders were described as white and Hispanic. Though the gunman was described as running through the house while firing his weapon, police said, not a single item in the home appeared to be knocked over. On Thursday, Rushing and Ethan Alexander Thompson, 19, were formally charged with two counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder, according to court papers. Timothy Alan Delahoy Jr., 18, was charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit murder and two counts of accessory after the fact of murder. Cody Xavier Davis, 19, was charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit murder and two counts of accessory after the fact of murder. On Friday, Wesley Bankston, 17, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit murder, police said. He was charged as an adult, but his lawyer told the court that she would seek to have him tried as a juvenile. All five have pleaded not guilty. The teens were being held on bond of between $2 million and $5 million, court officials said. Lawyers for Rushing and Bankston declined to comment; attorneys for the others could not immediately be reached for comment. A court affidavit obtained by CNN said that on January 20 Thorsten Rushing allegedly met with Thompson and Bankston and they agreed that Thompson would help remove the evidence after the shootings and that Bankston would drive. At the Rushing home, the affidavit said, Thompson hid in a closet for several hours before Thorsten Rushing allegedly killed his father and brother. He used a 9mm Glock to shoot them, authorities contend. Police said Thorsten Rushing and Thompson then allegedly pumped two shots into a wall to make it seem as if the intruders shot at Thorsten. The affidavit said the teens collected the evidence in a bag and called Bankston so that he could drive them to dispose of it. Later, Thorsten Rushing allegedly fired a shotgun blast into a wall before calling 911. After the slayings, the five teens met at the home of Thorsten Rushing's grandparents to discuss what happened, the affidavit said. They allegedly talked about burning the evidence bag but keeping the Glock in a car belonging to Bankston's father. Delahoy, Davis and Bankston later took outdoor target practice with the ""murder weapon,"" the affidavit said. Last Saturday, nearly a week after the slayings, Rushing and his four friends -- described as polite young men and good students -- were arrested after investigators discovered holes in their stories, police said. The slayings were supposed to happen earlier. Two days before the January 20 shooting, police said, Uwe Rushing bumped into a masked man as he was leaving the house. The masked man ran off. A couple of days later, police responded to a 2:05 a.m. call of a shooting at the Rushing home. The bodies of the father and son were found in the living room. Thorsten Rushing told investigators that two men entered the home through a rear door, and one of them shot his father and brother before Rushing got a shotgun and fired at the men, who fled. Florida community reels after mom kills son, daughter, self . ""The story and the evidence and the crime scene just didn't add up to where it was making any sense,"" said Capt. Craig Akard, Lawton police spokesman. Further investigation, including consultations with the medical examiner, began to unravel the version of events recounted by Rushing and his friends, police said. The motive has not been confirmed, Akard said, but he added that there was ""a little bit of turmoil"" in the household. ""Most of the people we talked to said the family was, I guess you could say, the Three Musketeers,"" Akard said. ""They got along. They did stuff together. But now that this happened, we're starting to hear, 'OK, maybe it wasn't quite as good as people said it was.' Apparently, it wasn't all as nice as what we heard.""

"(CNN) -- Two days ago, I learned about two young people killed by drug gangs in the border city of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, their corpses bound and hung from a bridge. Unfortunately, drug murders happen so often in Mexico that they are not news anymore. This time was different. The murders have received a lot of international attention because the bodies were found with handwritten messages claiming that the couple had been killed for snitching on the cartels via the Internet. Is it possible that these murders grabbed more attention than last month's 50-person massacre because of the connection to social media? As a technologist, I find it easy to get swept up in the techno-utopian view of how social technologies are changing the world for the better. I do believe it. For example, Twitter hashtags are saving lives in Mexico by empowering citizens to report shootings and helping others to avoid them. However, those same hashtags have landed three people in jail on charges of ""terrorism"" for supposedly spreading false rumors online. Now we learn about the murders of supposed ""Internet snitchers."" It is not clear whether the couple was killed for actually posting something online or whether their murder was used as an opportunity to scare people away from social media. In any case, the messages against online reporting might indicate that social media sites are seen as a threat. For example, one of the notes on the bodies named blogdelnarco.com, a website run anonymously on Google's Blogger platform. Social technologies, like other peer-to-peer technologies, are incredibly disruptive. Social media open new opportunities for empowering the disenfranchised, but they also create big new challenges -- some so big that people's lives might hang in the balance. There has been a heated discussion in the tech world about online anonymity, especially the ""real names only"" policies of some social networks. Social media is seen as neutral ground by people in Mexico. They might not trust their government or even their neighbors, but they do trust big-name, high-tech companies to provide an unbiased platform that empowers them to connect with others. These events in Mexico are another reminder of the responsibility that high-tech companies have when providing these empowering platforms. Yes, these are for-profit enterprises, but with great tech power comes great responsibility (as Stan Lee might say). The American media are in a privileged position to report safely on what is happening in Mexico. American journalists can, and should, amplify the voices of those who are unheard. Mexican voices present in social media speak of a complex problem with just as much relevance for the U.S. as Mexico. After all, the drug war is a thorny geopolitical conflict closely linked to U.S. financial stability and national security. The American public partially funds the war: via taxes on one side and through drug consumption on the other. My hope is that the fascination for social media communication will drive better coverage of systemic issues at the core of the conflict, such as debates on decriminalization, arms and human trafficking. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andres Monroy-Hernandez.","Writer says murdered couple in Mexico may have been revenge for blogging on drug cartels .

"(CNN) -- So, Gary Oldman, tell us what you really think. In a raw interview with Playboy, the actor, 56, railed against Hollywood ""dishonesty"" and double standards, said that Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin have been victims of hypocrisy and asserted that not voting for ""12 Years a Slave"" to win an Oscar meant ""you were a racist."" Oh, and he doesn't like the Golden Globes, helicopter parents or reality TV, either. Indeed, the ""Dark Knight"" actor, who's starring in the forthcoming ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"" pulled no punches when talking about pretty much anything. The conversation will appear in the magazine's July/August issue. The Gibson and Baldwin affairs really angered him, he said, because he believes their accusers don't exactly have clean hands themselves. ""I don't know about Mel. He got drunk and said a few things, but we've all said those things. We're all f***ing hypocrites,"" Oldman said. ""The policeman who arrested him has never used the word 'n*****' or 'that f***ing Jew'? I'm being brutally honest here. It's the hypocrisy of it that drives me crazy. ""Mel Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews and he said the wrong thing because he's actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him -- and doesn't need to feed him anymore because he's got enough dough,"" Oldman continued. ""But some Jewish guy in his office somewhere hasn't turned and said, 'That f***ing kraut' or 'F*** those Germans,' whatever it is? We all hide and try to be so politically correct. That's what gets me. It's just the sheer hypocrisy of everyone."" Other Oldman tidbits: . On reality TV: ""The museum of social decay."" On helicopter parents: ""There's never any unsupervised play to develop skills or learn about hierarchy in a group or how to share. The kids honestly believe they are the center of the f***ing universe. But then they get out into the real world and it's like, 'S**t, maybe it's not all about me,' and that leads to narcissism, depression and anxiety."" On political correctness at the Oscars: ""At the Oscars, if you didn't vote for '12 Years a Slave' you were a racist. "" On the Golden Globes: ""A meaningless event. ... It's 90 nobodies having a wank."" If Oldman is hard on Hollywood and its people, he's equally critical of himself. Asked about ""Sid & Nancy,"" his breakthrough film, he said, ""I don't like myself in the movie."" Ditto with ""The Fifth Element"" and ""The Dark Knight."" ""It was work,"" he said. (He did have kind things to say about the film ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"" Francis Ford Coppola and ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" director Alfonso Cuaron.) As the interview continued, Oldman -- who described his politics as ""libertarian"" -- recognized that he may have been a little too blunt. ""So this interview has gone very badly. You have to edit and cut half of what I've said, because it's going to make me sound like a bigot,"" he said at one point . ""You're not a bigot?"" replied interviewer David Hochman. ""No, but I'm defending all the wrong people,"" Oldman said. ""I'm saying Mel's all right. Alec's a good guy. So how do I come across? Angry?"" ""Passionate, certainly,"" Hochman said. ""Readers will have to form their own opinions."" ""It's dishonesty that frustrates me most,"" Oldman said. ""I can't bear double standards. It gets under my skin more than anything.""","Gary Oldman sounds off in Playboy interview .

"(CNN) -- By the time Edward Lee Elmore won his freedom at age 53, he had spent 30 years -- most of them on death row -- imprisoned in South Carolina for a crime he says he did not commit. Law enforcement planted evidence and prosecutors manipulated facts to cast Elmore as the only suspect in the 1982 murder of 75-year-old Dorothy Edwards, his lawyers claim. Even with seemingly overwhelming evidence in Elmore's favor, it took nearly two decades to win his release, in what an appeals court called ""one of those exceptional cases of 'extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems.' "" Read the U.S. Court of Appeals opinion on the case (PDF) His experience raises nearly every issue that shapes America's capital punishment debate: DNA testing, mental retardation, a jailhouse snitch, incompetent defense lawyers, prosecutorial misconduct and ""a strong claim of innocence,"" said author Raymond Bonner, who wrote about the case in ""Anatomy of Injustice: A Murder Case Gone Wrong."" In other words, a prime example of when ""innocence is not enough,"" Bonner said. Elmore would probably still be on death row if not for Diana Holt, who began investigating his claims of innocence in 1993. When Holt met Elmore, she was surprised that a convicted killer on death row could be ""so docile and gentle."" Two post-conviction review courts rejected Elmore's claims, though one noted that he ""may well not be guilty."" But Holt never considered giving up. ""If I throw in the towel, a client dies. If I stop working, they stop breathing,"" Holt said. ""Sometimes, I am the first person who ever stuck by them or treated them with respect."" A bloody crime scene . Elmore was arrested in January 1982 for the rape and murder of Edwards, a wealthy widow in Greenwood, South Carolina. Edwards' longtime neighbor and friend, Greenwood City Councilman Jimmy Holloway, told police he let himself into her house after noticing newspapers piling up in her driveway. Inside the house, he discovered her bloody corpse in a bedroom closet and alerted police. Holloway also identified Elmore, who had cleaned Edwards' windows and gutters the month before, as a possible suspect. Within 48 hours, police arrested Elmore based on a thumbprint found on Edwards' back door. By April, a Greenwood County jury had convicted Elmore of murder and sentenced him to death. It would be the first of three times he would stand trial in the case, followed by years of appeals and post-conviction reviews. When Holt took on the case, she says, she discovered a disturbing chain of events that led to Elmore's conviction, starting with law enforcement's willingness to build a case around Holloway's timeline. From there, Elmore's lawyers say, prosecutors suppressed blood and fingerprint evidence that could have cast doubt on their case. Instead, Elmore's lawyers claim that prosecutors deliberately introduced falsely incriminating statements from a jailhouse informant and hairs from Elmore that were not found at the crime scene. A breakthrough finally came in 2011, when the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Elmore's conviction and ordered a new trial, based partly on findings that Elmore's trial lawyers blindly accepted the prosecution's case without bothering to examine the evidence in his first trial and retrial. ""A healthy skepticism of authority, while generally advisable, is an absolute necessity for a lawyer representing a client charged with capital murder,"" a judge wrote in the majority opinion. ""Elmore's lawyers disregarded their professional obligation to investigate critical prosecution evidence, thereby engendering 'a breakdown in the adversarial process that our system counts on to produce just results.' "" 'Couldn't believe my eyes' None of it would have come to light if not for Holt. She was in her mid-30s when she joined the case the summer before her third year of law school. Her journey to law school had been hard-fought, with a history of abusive relationships and a stint as a teen serving time in a Louisiana prison for armed robbery. At 28, she began taking community college classes and earned the grades to enter Southwest Texas State University. Given her past, Holt was pleasantly surprised when the University of Texas accepted her law school application in 1991. Her professors nudged her in the direction of death penalty litigation when she began to show a knack for the persistent digging the job demands. Through internships at the Texas Resource Center, Holt met lawyer John Blume, executive director of the South Carolina Death Penalty Resource Center. During an internship there, Blume asked her to help with Elmore's case by interviewing jurors. ""I started reading the trial testimony and couldn't believe my eyes,"" Holt said. ""All the forensic evidence evaporated under the smallest measure of scrutiny."" She became immersed in the case, ""all Elmore, all the time,"" and ""classes became more like an annoying distraction,"" she said. Blume offered her a job as a staff attorney once she graduated, but she couldn't wait and moved to South Carolina before the final spring semester, for ""Elmore and John Blume,"" she said, half-joking. A few things about the case jumped out at her. For one, police said they had seized pubic hairs from Edwards' bed and identified them as belonging to Elmore. If that was true, Holt wondered, where were crime scene photos of those hairs on the bed? Why weren't they packaged like other evidence taken from the scene? Why didn't investigators collect the bedsheets for further analysis? Elmore conceded that hairs introduced into trial evidence belonged to him but claimed that police pulled them from his head and groin area after his arrest. Meanwhile, fibers and hairs collected from Edwards' body and marked ""item T"" on an evidence log were never introduced into evidence. For years, the state claimed they were missing, until 1998, when they were found in the private office of an investigator in the case. Testing revealed a ""Caucasian pubic hair inconsistent with Mrs. Edwards"" that Elmore's team claims could have cast doubt on the state's theory that he was the only possible killer. Holloway's ""farcical"" trial testimony also led Holt to question his portrayal by prosecutors as a shocked neighbor and longtime friend. When Holt interviewed Holloway in 1993, within five minutes, she said, he told her, ""I am the only one who could kill her and get away with it, the way she trusted me so."" Holloway died in 1994. And yet, when Elmore walked out of prison in 2012, he was not fully exonerated. Elmore agreed to a deal with prosecutors that allowed him to maintain his innocence while pleading guilty. In exchange for pleading guilty to murder, the state dropped a burglary charge and agreed to a 30-year sentence with credit for time served. In the 2012 hearing, prosecutor Jerry Peace said that the state still believed it had a strong case against Elmore but that the victim's daughter supported the plea as a means of ending the case. Read more about the plea deal (PDF) Holt, however, told the court that his defense team believed Elmore is ""100% innocent"" but also sought to end the case. He could have gone to trial, but she has seen other clients wait years for a retrial. She also would have preferred an all-out acquittal, but ""immediate freedom stymied ongoing justice,"" she said. ""That the justice system provided an avenue for an immediate release to freedom for Mr. Elmore that was previously not available to him is more justice than injustice,"" she said. ""Justice was better served with his freedom."" If you were in Elmore's shoes, would you plead guilty to a crime you did not commit, in order to get out of prison?

"(CNN) -- I watched as the sellers and beggars descended on her. I was thankful she was walking in front of me although I knew my turn would soon follow. There were women hawking iced water and children with prayer beads, wooden sculptures and cotton pants. Everyone trying to get her attention by saying, ""Lady, lady ... You want water? Buy something ... pants, water? Madame, lady, you buy something ..."" The woman who was the target of this avalanche of requests -- who, like me, was a tourist at the Angkor Wat temples in Cambodia -- walked along the road toward the area where the buses and drivers waited to pick visitors up. As the seconds passed, she said ""no"" and ""no thank you,"" and some of the sellers and beggars relented. Some did not. They dug in and stuck with her, pulling on her shirt and saying again and again and again, ""Buy something, lady."" The woman finally shrieked ""NO!!!!"" I was surprised and actually relieved to see this. I had done the same thing the day before. Of course, I felt embarrassed at my strong and exasperated response. It is a simple word understood across languages and cultures. No. But clearly as I saw this stranger demonstrate, making ourselves understood when saying what seems to be so simple is another matter. We have all been there on the receiving end of a request that we do not want or simply cannot accommodate, and many have much higher stakes than the answer we give to strangers at a tourist spot 12 time zones away. We know that feeling of ""here it comes"" in anticipation of a request that may not fit with our lives. We have all been there -- a request comes in via e-mail -- and we are loath to agree. For a variety of reasons, we simply cannot, must not, will not, we tell ourselves, but we do. These requests come from people in our lives: Our bosses, colleagues, brothers, sisters, children, friends, partners, even from friends of friends, otherwise known as strangers. For things big and small, easy and difficult to accomplish. For some reason, saying no is much harder than it should be. Out of curiosity, and with guidance from Dan Ariely, a professor of economics and psychology at Duke University in North Carolina, I crafted a survey asking people about their experiences in turning down requests. We wondered whether there was a way to say no that did not involve guilt or anger for either the rejected or rejected. We discovered a number of interesting things: Many of us are saying no in limping, half-baked ways that leave neither us nor the rejected party feeling good about the answer. Judging by the roughly 500 people who took the time to answer our survey, the experience of saying no and feeling badly about it is common -- and interestingly, falls along gender lines. Specifically, women were more likely to anticipate they would feel badly if they said no and did in fact feel badly when they did say no. Our results also indicated women felt even worse about saying no when the request came from another woman. Men were more likely to anticipate they would not feel too badly. They reported after the fact that they felt just as they had anticipated when they rejected requests made of them. It was eye-opening to see the actual requests that were made. From money and co-signing for student loans and new cars (from nonfamily members) to taking care of untrained, ""scary"" dogs and even children who jump on the furniture and generally ignore house rules. There were requests for time to volunteer at church, to cook meals, to make long car trips and to provide places to live, couches to sleep on, letters of recommendation and even the ashes and urn of a loved one. Most people seemed to really take time to see whether getting to yes was even possible. It was not rare for people to include explanations about the constraints that would prevent them from being able to say yes. Some even thanked the person making the request for thinking of them. Overall, respondents were thoughtful and tried to be helpful. In their rejection of the request, they sometimes offered other solutions or compromises. This stands in sharp contrast to the recent tussle on LinkedIn between a communication professional and a job seeker. As hard as it is to say no, in many cases, people have to learn the skill, or they risk finding their time, money and resources exhausted. If you are someone inundated with requests, here are a few suggestions to get past your own resistance to saying no: . 1. Take your time in deciding: Do not feel obligated to give an answer on the spot. Some people use e-mail auto-responders to buy them time to consider all requests, and this seems to be a strategy that works well. 2. Get more details about the request: Often requests end up involving much more work than it may seem initially. Make sure to get all the details necessary to make an informed decision. Also feel free to change your mind. Many participants reported saying yes and then going back and rejecting the request after a couple of days' thought. See No. 1. 3. Align with your priorities: Saying no may be difficult but if what you are being asked to do does not align with your priorities or values, then it will be a poor use of your time and energy -- no matter what the request. One participant shared how her stepchild had asked for the urn and ashes of his father, her deceased husband. They had been married 20 years; she wanted to keep ""him"" with her even after death. She told her stepson that when she passed away, the ashes would go to him, but in the meantime, she was going to keep them. A sensible compromise can go a long way. 4. Find a ""go-to"" system: A number of the participants said that they had set up a go-to system to help them both make and deliver the decisions. For instance, they had rules about certain kinds of requests: They had a predetermined number of requests they would agree to each month or year. Others had several pre-written responses in their e-mail accounts that they could send out once they had classified what category the request fell into for them. Others indicated they preferred to say no in writing via text or e-mail instead of verbally, because it made the process easier for them. 5. Give up the guilt: The research indicates that many women anticipate and feel badly about saying no. That does not help. Give up the guilt, consider what you agree to do and what you are able and then just get on with it. Know that saying no will create fallout -- feel OK about that. It is an inevitable part of the process. The results to the initial survey only increased our curiosity about the whole process of saying no. Because the responses were so rich, we are eager to explore the topic more deeply to get a better sense of what works and what strategies people are using. We are also curious about how positions of authority as well as emotions such as regret, fear and anger influence our ability to say no. We also hope to gain more insight into how relationships and gender frame the rejection of requests. We invite you to take a few minutes to participate in the survey.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- An arrest has been made in the investigation of an illegal prescription drug ring connected to actor Corey Haim, a spokesman for California's attorney general said Wednesday. Attorney General Jerry Brown is not revealing details of the arrest, his office said, but it comes soon after he revealed that pharmacy records show the actor got thousands of dangerous pills from dozens of doctors in the past year. The person arrested was not directly connected to Haim but is suspected to be part of the drug ring, Brown spokeswoman Christine Gasparac said. Brown said last week that Haim's death was linked to an ""illegal and massive prescription-drug ring."" Although the actor's family said Haim had reduced his drug use to near zero, Brown said Friday on HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" that he didn't see ""any 'zero' pill consumption."" ""If he took all the pills that our records show he was prescribed over the last year and three months, he took very damaging assaults on his body,"" Brown said. Haim, 38, had pneumonia, an enlarged heart and water in his lungs when he died March 10, Los Angeles County Deputy Coroner Ed Winter said. But a drug overdose cannot be ruled out until toxicology results are completed, which will probably be in several weeks, Winter said. State investigators know that Haim obtained ""massive amounts"" of legal drugs ""in what looks to me like a questionable manner because of so many doctors,"" Brown said. ""How many people go to 10 or 15 or 20 doctors and then run around to 10, 12 and more pharmacies to go fulfill them and sometimes two different doctors in the same day?"" Brown asked. Haim's most recent prescription was filled March 5 for Vicodin, he said. ""In the weeks before that, more Vicodin, more Valium and other things,"" Brown said. ""If you go back to 2009, you're talking thousands of pills,"" he said. ""You're talking many, many doctors. I doubt if they know about each other. You're talking about many, many pharmacies."" The 1980s teen movie star died after collapsing at the Los Angeles apartment he shared with his mother. The illegal prescription ring involved the use of stolen identities from doctors to order official prescription pads, Brown said. ""Once they get that prescription pad in the doctor's name, then they can write a prescription, or they can sell it to someone to write a prescription like Corey Haim,"" Brown said. ""Then he can go into the pharmacy and get his legal drugs illegally."" The former child actor also obtained Oxycontin using one of the counterfeit prescriptions last year, Brown said. Despite Brown's statements, Haim's manager insists that it was not a drug overdose but a perhaps drug reaction that took the actor's life. Just weeks before his death, Haim began seeing an addiction specialist to help completely kick his dependence, manager Mark Heaslip said. Heaslip and Haim's mother suspect that something went wrong with that treatment. ""There was a prescription that was given to him that he had never taken, and he only took one, and I have a funny feeling that he had a reaction to it,"" Heaslip said. Haim's mother told the specialist not to give her son the pills, he said, and Haim fell ill with flu-like symptoms soon after he took just one of the pills. On March 9, hours before his death, Haim stayed with his mother in the apartment they shared on the edge of Burbank, California. ""It was like he had a flu, but he was slurring like an overdose,"" Heaslip said. ""He was very coherent and talked normal."" The loss is harder for family and friends to grasp because it came at a time when Haim had much to live for. He was helping his mother with her cancer treatments, using income from two recent feature film roles to pay her medical bills, Heaslip said. Several prescription drug bottles were taken from Haim's apartment, Deputy Coroner Winter said Friday. Although the bottles indicated that the drugs included Vicodin, Valium and Soma, no tests have been done to confirm what they are, he said. Haim had a prescription for the muscle relaxer Soma and the narcotic pain reliever Norco filled at a pharmacy February 26, a source with knowledge of the transaction said. Two days after Haim picked up the drugs, his primary care doctor called the San Fernando Valley pharmacy to ask about the prescriptions, the source said. The doctor said ""Haim was not feeling well"" and he needed to know what drugs had been prescribed, the source said. The source, who worked at the pharmacy, asked not to be identified because his employer had not authorized him to talk. Brown said Haim got prescriptions from four or five different doctors in the past three months. Heaslip said he had talked to Haim in recent months about the dangers of easy access to prescription narcotics. Haim said he wanted California legislators to pass ""Corey's law,"" which he said should prevent doctors from prescribing more than a three-day supply of addictive drugs at one time, his manager said. In recent years, the actor was reunited with longtime friend and frequent co-star Corey Feldman in a reality show. ""The Two Coreys"" ran for two seasons on the A&E Network before it was canceled. Haim's most famous role was in the 1987 movie ""The Lost Boys,"" in which he also appeared with Feldman. Haim played the role of a fresh-faced teenager whose brother becomes a vampire.","California attorney general won't reveal details of arrest .

"(CNN) -- Investigators will return to a North Carolina pond on Thursday morning as police continue their search for a missing Fort Bragg soldier, officials said. A lead in the case of Pfc. Kelli Bordeaux led to the Wednesday deployment of a dive team in nearby Eastover, said spokesman Gavin MacRoberts of the Fayetteville Police Department. Eastover is northeast of Fayetteville, in Cumberland County. Police Chief Tom Bergamine said Wednesday night he could not discuss leads in the case. Detectives have spoken with one of the last people known to have contact with Bordeaux, the chief said. ""Anybody that had last seen her on the early morning of Saturday is someone we want to talk to."" Police and the military also searched an area near a Fayetteville bar where Bordeaux was last seen and last used her cell phone, authorities said. The soldier, 23, left the Froggy Bottoms bar early Saturday, police have said. The GI had been drinking and was given a ride home by a bar employee, according to a U.S. Army official who spoke on condition of anonymity. At some point, the Army official said, Bordeaux sent two text messages. One said, ""got home safely."" The official did not know who the text was sent to or the contents of the second text message. The areas to be searched are near the bar and Interstate 295, Bergamine told reporters earlier Wednesday. Records showed Bordeaux's cell phone ""pinging"" off a tower nearby early Saturday, he said. Authorities have talked with ""numerous individuals"" as part of the investigation into Bordeaux's disappearance, he said. They include Bordeaux's husband, who did not accompany her to the bar, he said. Officers believe the husband was not in town at the time of his wife's disappearance. Asked whether police believe Bordeaux is in danger, Bergamine said authorities are suspicious that no one has heard from her, adding she is described as ""a very good soldier, not the type of person that would come up AWOL or missing."" Bergamine refused to comment on several questions, including one about the text messages. On whether Bordeaux is believed to be a random victim, Bergamine would say only that the case is classified as a missing-persons case, and ""there is a lot that is not known."" The Army official said police searched Bordeaux's apartment and vehicle, but the official did not know where the vehicle was found. Bordeaux was reported missing Monday when she failed to report for duty, the official said. Bordeaux's older sister, Olivia Cox, told reporters Tuesday it was out of character for Bordeaux to miss work. Bordeaux's mother, Johnna Henson, said she had been told by police that an individual gave her daughter a ride to the bar, where she took part in karaoke. Henson told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Tuesday that her daughter was ""spooked"" while someone was driving her home, and that Bordeaux reportedly told the driver to let her out before she reached her apartment. Henson said she does not believe her daughter arrived home. Bordeaux is described as being 5 feet tall and weighing 99 pounds, with blond hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing black shorts and a pink halter top, police said. Bordeaux is from St. Cloud, Florida, and lives off base, according to Jackie Thomas, Fort Bragg spokeswoman. A health service specialist, Bordeaux is assigned to the 601st Area Support Medical Company, 261st Multifunctional Medical Battalion, 44th Medical Brigade. Bordeaux and her civilian husband have been married two years, according to Cox. The sisters last communicated on Friday. ""I texted her. And we laughed and joked and everything was happy,"" said Cox. Police asked anyone with information to contact Fayetteville police. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","Search of pond area will continue Thursday morning .

"(CNN) -- Even after apologizing for criticizing a referee, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini wasn't let off the hook by UEFA. Pellegrini was banned for three games by football's European governing body, a decision which rules him out of the second leg of City's Champions League round-of-16 encounter at Barcelona on March 12. ""Pellegrini may follow the game from the stands only; he may not enter the dressing room, tunnel or technical area before or during the match; and he may not communicate directly or indirectly with his players and/or technical staff during the game,"" UEFA said on its website. He is on ""probation"" for two years for one of the matches, with Pellegrini having the right to appeal Friday's ruling. Barcelona won the first leg in Manchester 2-0 on February 18 and the Chilean was unhappy that a free kick wasn't awarded to his side in a sequence which resulted in a penalty for Barcelona and City's defender Martin Demichelis being sent off. He said the Swedish referee, Jonas Eriksson, was ""not impartial to both teams"" and added that an official from the Scandinavian nation should not have been chosen in the first place. ""I think it was not a good idea to put a referee from Sweden in charge of such an important match, especially a referee who has made an important mistake against Barcelona in a previous match,"" he told reporters. ""A big game with two important teams, that kind of game needs a referee with more experience."" Pellegrini said sorry three days after the opening leg. ""The thing I said in that moment doesn't mean what I think,"" Pellegrini commented. ""I am sure this is a good referee because UEFA are always evaluating all the referees and if he is not a good referee, he is not in the UEFA staff."" Both Manchester City and Barcelona face crucial matches on Sunday before the second leg takes place. City, chasing a quadruple, can win its first trophy of the season when it meets lowly Sunderland in England's League Cup final. Barcelona, meanwhile, hosts Almeria having dropped three points behind league leader Real Madrid in La Liga.","Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini receives a three-game ban from UEFA .

"(CNN) -- Alec Baldwin claims he was assaulted by a photographer on a New York street Tuesday morning, but the New York Daily News accuses the actor of attacking its employee. The incident happened as Baldwin emerged from the city's Marriage License Bureau, where he obtained a marriage license with fiancee Hilaria Thomas, the Daily News reported. ""A 'photographer' almost hit me in the face with his camera this morning,"" Baldwin said in a Twitter posting, which carried the hashtag #allpaparazzishouldbewaterboarded. The newspaper said Baldwin, who ""approached with an angry glare,"" hit Daily News photographer Marcus Santos, who was ""standing innocently with two other photographers,"" in his chin. ""He was looking mad,"" the paper quoted Santos saying. ""He said, 'Step back; step back.' I said, 'We're moving back.'"" Santos said he stepped back, but Baldwin ""kept coming."" Photos taken by one of the other photographers and published by the Daily News showed the confrontation, including one image of Baldwin with his hands extended toward Santos' chest. Baldwin's representative, in a written statement to CNN on Tuesday, said the actor and his fiancee were leaving New York City Hall when a ""'civilian' walking in front of Alec positioned himself to obstruct the view of a photographer aggressively trying to shoot the couple."" ""The photographer was clearly frustrated, pushed past the bystander and assaulted Alec with his camera,"" rep Matthew Hiltzik said. ""There were no punches thrown, and any subsequent physical contact was simply Alec protecting himself."" Previously on CNN: Alec Baldwin talks about getting kicked off plane .

"(CNN) -- The good news for Tiger Woods at the Honda Classic was that his second round was better than the first. But Woods still has a long way to go if he is to win his first golf tournament of 2014. While Woods struggled to find his best form, Rory McIlroy had another fine day and was the clubhouse leader late in the second round at 11-under-par 129, 11 shots better than Woods. Woods carded a 1-over 71 on Thursday in Palm Beach Gardens and improved by two shots Friday. He mixed three birdies with two bogeys, narrowly missing a birdie at the last on a shortish putt. He got himself out of trouble at the 12th to save par following a poor tee shot and then executed a sumptuous chip for a birdie at the 13th. The world No. 1 was expected to make the cut -- after missing a 54-hole cut at the Farmers Insurance Open in January. Phil Mickelson, though, wasn't. 'Lefty' was at 1-over after a 71 Friday, undone by a double bogey at the 16th. ""No, I won't make the cut,"" Mickelson, ranked fifth, told reporters. ""I had a tough time making birdies. My distance control was off. It just wasn't sharp."" Henrik Stenson, the hottest player on the circuit at the end of 2013, surely won't be around on the weekend since he tallied a 9-over through two rounds. The Swede's round included a double bogey and six bogeys. It was only last year that McIlroy walked off the course in the second round, blaming a toothache. He later apologized but the episode was all part of a poor 2013. This week in Florida, McIlroy is looking more like the golfer who won the event in 2012 on his way to the No. 1 ranking. ""It's a different end of the spectrum I guess,"" McIlroy told the PGA Tour's website. ""I wasn't quite comfortable with my golf swing. I was still tinkering with equipment. I just wasn't feeling in control of what I needed to be in control of. ""This year is obviously a lot different."" McIlroy couldn't match his sizzling 63 on Thursday but he still wasn't shabby. After hitting bogeys in two of his first three holes, McIlroy didn't drop another shot and struck six birdies for a 66. The tough course was clearly taking its toll, as McIlroy was the lone member of the top eight in the world rankings to be inside the top 20 at the Honda Classic nearing the end of play Friday.","Tiger Woods has a better day at the Honda Classic on Friday in Florida .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-five of 27 spent-fuel storage casks at a Virginia nuclear plant were shifted between 1 and 4 inches during last week's 5.8-magnitude earthquake, officials said Thursday. The cylinders, each 16 feet tall and weighing 115 tons, were not damaged, and no radiation was released, said Rick Zuercher, spokesman for Dominion Virginia Power, which operates the North Anna Power Station near Louisa, Virginia. Monitors were hooked up to the casks to determine any abnormalities, he said. He said the casks' movement was known shortly after the quake, which had an epicenter less than 20 miles from the plant, but the news was not released to the public. ""We had a lot going on,"" Zuercher said. ""There was no indication of any problem ... and there isn't any problem."" Besides those casks, which are vertical, some of the horizontal bunkers holding spent fuel also were affected. The concrete ""came loose on the face"" of ""a few"" of the bunkers, Zuercher said, but the damage is not considered serious. The bunkers -- of which 13 of the 26 hold rods -- are each 16 feet long and weigh 50 tons. It is the first time such casks have been shifted by an earthquake in U.S. history, said Roger Hannah, spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as it's the first time a quake of this magnitude was felt at a nuclear plant in the country. The safety standards for such casks, he said, are ""unbelievable."" They undergo a rigorous series of tests, including crash tests and burning. ""To say they are robust would be an understatement,"" Hannah said. Zuercher, however, confirmed a report in the Washington Post that Dominion Virginia Power had notified the NRC last Friday that the earthquake might have shaken the power station more than it was designed to handle. The NRC already has an ""augmented inspection team"" at the North Anna plant to conduct a review of effects from the earthquake. The team will review the casks' shifting as part of that investigation, Hannah said. The NRC initially sent a seismic expert and a structural expert to assist resident inspectors at the site after the earthquake, but ""further reviews indicated that additional inspection is warranted,"" the commission said in a statement issued Monday. An augmented inspection team is formed ""to review more significant events or issues"" at NRC facilities, and includes technical experts and additional inspectors. An alert was declared at the North Anna station just after the quake struck. The plant's two units shut down automatically after the facility lost off-site power, according to the NRC. Emergency diesel generators provided power to cool the reactors until off-site power was restored a few hours later. ""An alert is the next-to-lowest NRC emergency classification for plant events, and the North Anna station exited the alert after off-site power was restored,"" the commission said in a statement. Both reactors remain in what is called a ""cold shutdown,"" Zuercher said. There is no timetable for their reactivation, he said. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","NEW: The nuclear plant might have been shaken harder than it was designed to bear .

"(CNN) -- As the ""sextortion"" plot involving David Letterman continues to unfold, chit-chat about sex and the workplace -- always a water-cooler favorite -- is getting extra play. Nicole Williams is the author of ""Girl on Top: Your Guide to Turning Dating Rules into Career Success."" That's good news for Nicole Williams, a career expert and author of the in-stores-next-week ""Girl on Top: Your Guide to Turning Dating Rules into Career Success."" The media storm surrounding Letterman, she says, is bringing to the forefront an issue that's as relevant and pervasive as ever. ""Eight million Americans every year enter into at least one romance starting from work,"" she said, quoting a statistic from Vault.com, an online career site. This number doesn't tell the whole story, she added, estimating that 50 percent of workplace dalliances go unreported -- though they're likely fodder for whispers and speculations. ""The chemistry and energy of flirtation and sexuality,"" whether people act on it or not, she said, ""is a driver in the workplace."" CNN spoke to Williams about this touchy dynamic, the rules that can make this reality less dangerous and the questions she has about what's happened in the ""Late Show"" offices. Here are excerpts from that interview: . CNN: Why should we assume workplace romances and flings are happening as often as ever? Haven't we moved away from that? Williams: It is human nature. Sex is on men's brains; we know this. ... To think that -- during, in some cases, a 12-hour day -- this isn't going to come up in the workplace is naiveté. CNN: If the goal of your new book is to help woman succeed professionally, shouldn't there be general rules when it comes to sex and the workplace? Williams: At the end of the day, it is very dangerous to have sex with your boss. It just is. Your reputation can be hit in a way that's unrecoverable. Trading sex for promotion is essentially prostitution. But it's not sexual harassment unless a woman claims discrimination. ... The definition of flirting is making people feel good about themselves. We work such long hours and sometimes need to make it more fun. What's appropriate for one person, though, may not be appropriate for someone else. CNN: When it goes beyond flirtation and someone gets burned, don't women more often than men pay the price? Williams: The majority of managers are still, by and large, men. The person in power wins. It's hard to go up against a David Letterman. You can get demolished. Even if [a woman] was legitimately taken advantage of, there are those who say, ""Did she call it sexual harassment for money's sake?"" Men are saying [vis-a-vis the Letterman issue], ""So what?"" And women are saying, ""Did she really have a choice?"" CNN: Given what we know so far about the Letterman story, what is the biggest takeaway at this point? Williams: There's so much that's left to be revealed. That no one's complained -- he's never had a complaint of sexual harassment -- is interesting. It either means we're so much more evolved and no one cares or [women haven't had] the voice with which to complain. CNN: In cases where true love grows and can't be avoided in the workplace, how should a couple proceed? Williams: Companies are trying to institute love policies and love contracts -- guidelines on how to act. But that requires that they [couples] come forward. People feel like it's their business and not their boss' business. I really do believe it is a responsible, mature thing to do to go to upper management. Go to the CEO, whomever you have a good relationship with, have the conversation. ... If you can, you find a way not to work directly with one another. You often have to make a tough choice. Does one of you have to leave? ... You're better off putting it out there. CNN: What other practical suggestions do you have for workplace couples? Williams: You sit down and say, ""What are our rules? No necking in the lunchroom. We're not going to have fights publicly."" The answer isn't don't [have the relationship]. Really, it isn't. It's how to best manage it. CNN: Given the tough economy and possible backlash, isn't flirting with a co-worker even more dangerous? Williams: [laughs] Yes, but I've heard from women who are using that tactic to ensure they still have the job. Maybe I need to start flirting with my boss, so he'll keep me around?","Water-cooler topic, workplace romance, stirred up by ""sextortion"" of David Letterman .

"(CNN) -- Football's world governing body, FIFA, has officially sanctioned the wearing of religious headscarves. The announcement made at the Annual General Meeting of the International Football Association Board (IFAB) in Zurich, Switzerland follows a successful trial period which began in July 2012. ""The IFAB approved the modification to the interpretation of 'Law 4 -- The Players' Equipment' specifying the provisions by which male and female players can now wear head covers,"" read a statement on FIFA's website on Saturday. ""After a two-year pilot, The IFAB agreed that there was no indication as to why the wearing of head covers should be prohibited..."" FIFA banned the wearing of headscarves in 2007 on the grounds of safety, but the ruling caused controversy. In 2011, Iran's women's team forfeited a Olympic qualifying match against Jordan because members of their team were prohibited from wearing headscarves. However, following a request by Zhang Jilong from the Asian Football Federation in January 2012, FIFA unanimously approved headscarves for a trial period six months later. A further relaxation of FIFA rules came in July 2013 after the Canadian Soccer Federation lobbied FIFA to change rules to allow turbans to be worn on the football pitch. No more slogans on undershirts . On the same day it was relaxing its position on headscarves, IFAB also announced a tightening up of rules on undergarments bearing slogans. Until now, some slogans have been allowed but a blanket ban will now be imposed. ""Players must not reveal undergarments showing slogans or advertising. The basic compulsory equipment must not have any political, religious or personal statements. A player removing his jersey or shirt to reveal slogans or advertising will be sanctioned by the competition organiser,"" FIFA states. ""From now on there can be no slogan or image whatsoever on undergarments even good-natured ones. This will apply from June 1 and will be in force for the World Cup,"" FIFA secretary general, Jerome Valcke said. Players frequently lift their shirts after scoring a goal to reveal a range of messages from dedications to new born babies to get well soon messages to players or friends. But these, along with more colorful statements like Mario Balotelli's ""Why always me?"" revealed while playing for Manchester City in 2011, will now be banned. ""The idea is to get some consistency. The simplest rule for the image of the game is to start from the basis that slogans will not be allowed,"" said Alex Horne, general secretary of the English Football Association.

"(CNN) -- Panic ensued at LAX when a woman lost control of her car near one terminal, and a crank caller reported a gunman in another Friday night, authorities said. The two incidents occurred at terminals 5 and 4, respectively, at the Los Angeles International Airport. Passengers fled terminal 5, spooked by the banging sound of an SUV crashing outside the terminal. ""A driver had a medical emergency, causing her to lose control of the vehicle,"" said Patrick M.

Almost simultaneously, a call was placed in dispatch -- ""probably a prank"" -- saying there was a man with a gun in terminal 4, Gannon said. Officers evacuated the area and stormed in, guns drawn. ""Get down, get down,"" officers shouted as crowds hovered behind walls. Police searched the terminal, then declared it safe. ""We did not find anybody there with a gun.

"(CNN) -- She was trying to get help for her sister. Help for a woman who was distraught and uneven, having driven to Florida to get away from her husband. Who had gone, at her sister's urging, to a hospital only to sign herself out earlier in the day. A woman who was ""talking about Jesus and that there's demons in my house,"" her sister said on a 911 call. ""I'm trying to control her,"" the sister said, expressing worry about her sister's three children. ""... I'm trying to keep them safe."" At first, the plea appeared to pay off: Police caught up to the woman -- later identified as Ebony Wilkerson -- after she sped away from her sister's Daytona Beach apartment. An officer questioned her as her three children sat in the Honda Odyssey's backseat, smiling and seemingly calm. Wilkerson explained that she feared for her safety, worried that her estranged husband would harm them. According to a Daytona Beach Police report, the officer believed she might have a mental illness. Despite these concerns, the officer talked to a detective also at the scene and let her go on her way, concluding she couldn't be held under a Florida law that allows for detention of people believed to be impaired by mental illness and who possibly pose a risk of harm. Almost two hours later Tuesday, Wilkerson drove her black minivan -- with the three kids still inside -- into the surf of the Atlantic Ocean. Tim Tesseneer was driving along Daytona Beach on Tuesday with his wife when they noticed the minivan driving through shallow water. They heard the screams, he said, of two children, who were crying and waving for help out of one of the rear windows. Tesseneer threw the car in park and raced over to help. One child was screaming, Tesseneer recalled Wednesday to CNN's Piers Morgan. ""'Please help us, our mom is trying to kill us.'"" The other child he could see was wrestling a woman for the steering wheel. But the woman just kept saying, ""'We're OK. We're OK. We're OK,'"" as another man joined Tesseneer trying to get the driver to stop. With the minivan in the cold, heavy surf of the Atlantic, the second man, Stacy Robinson, opened a door and pulled out the two panicked children. There was a good chance if he and Tesseneer hadn't been there, the children, ages 10 and 9, would have drowned inside the van as it pitched in the water, officials said. Another child, a 3-year-old girl, was strapped in a car seat. A lifeguard dived in through a front window and unbuckled the child and handed her to another lifeguard as the vehicle bobbed in water about 3 feet deep. Meanwhile, Wilkerson walked away quietly with a strange, almost ""possessed"" look on her face, witnesses said. Not for long. Authorities quickly caught up to her. And on Friday she was officially arrested on three counts of attempted first-degree murder, according to Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson. Given what authorities have said since Tuesday's incident, the charges hardly come as a surprise. Still, as more details come out -- like the sister's 911 call and the charging affidavit -- they paint an ever more disturbing picture, especially for Wilkerson's children. For evidence of their ordeal, one need only listen to what all three continuously uttered when officers caught up with them at Halifax Health Medical Center. ""Mom tried to kill us."" Mom said: 'I am keeping all of us safe' The story begins in South Carolina, where Wilkerson and her children had been until she made the decision to leave the state, to leave her husband behind. Her children later detailed the fractured relationship between their parents, as well as the time her son got into trouble after speaking to authorities probing a domestic situation there. ""She came down to me for protection,"" Wilkerson's sister explained in her 911 call, of the quartet coming to the eastern Florida coast. Wilkerson's sister was especially concerned about protecting the three children. Wilkerson's fragile mental state led her to call police to ask for a well-being check ""because she's ... having psychosis or something or postpartum."" The sister explained they'd gone to the hospital Monday, only to have a pregnant Wilkerson check herself out the next day even though ""she's still not all there."" And she'd taken away the minivan's keys so her sister couldn't drive away with her children. Or so she thought. However she did it, Wilkerson drove off as her sister talked with police. That was followed by the initial encounter with the officer and detective, then later the incident on Daytona Beach. The children later told investigators that their mother told them ""to close their eyes and go to sleep."" As they screamed as the minivan went into the water, she insisted she was taking them to a better place, saying repeatedly: ""I am keeping all of us safe."" After their rescue, Wilkerson herself talked to authorities. ""She seemed confused and jumped from one religious topic to another,"" states the charging affidavit. Wilkerson explained at one point that she'd been driving ""too close to the water (when) the waves pulled her in."" Then, near the end of their talk, she said she did not want her husband around her children. On Thursday night, an arrest warrant was signed for Wilkerson. And shortly after 11 a.m. -- after being released from Halifax Health -- she was arrested. Wilkerson was being held on three counts of aggravated child abuse in addition to the first-degree murder charge, Johnson said Friday. Her bond has been set at $1.2 million, said James Purdy, the elected public defender for the 7th Judicial Circuit of Florida. Purdy said he would seek a court hearing on that bond, which could occur in the next week or so. He said he was going to speak with Wilkerson on Saturday. Investigators have claimed in the charging affidavit: ""Ebony Wilkerson acted with premeditated design to kill her three children.

"(CNN) -- ""You've got to save your best leadership for home."" These are the words of retired U.S. Army Commander Lt. General Russel L. Honore at a recent speaking event on leadership in the 21st century. Two nights ago, I found my two most active roles in life -- family man and journalist -- intersecting in a crisis. It was 3 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon when my wife alerted me. I was enjoying my afternoon off, comfortable in the warmth of our home, watching the snow from a rare winter storm blanket our deck and backyard. My wife, who is a fifth-grade school teacher in Fulton County, Georgia, received word that her school was shutting down because of the inclement weather. ""Honey I've got the kids. I'm on my way home,"" she said after school was dismissed early, and parents were rushing to get their children. As a journalist, I recognized that a news story was breaking before me. My wife's normal 20-minute daily commute was about to turn into an ordeal that would last nearly 24 hours. And I soon discovered that skills honed over years in the newsroom, were my best tools for assisting my wife and children. More than three hours later, she still hadn't moved very far. We stayed in constant contact as she inched along the 6-mile stretch of state highway leading her home. From the news, I soon realized this was no ordinary traffic jam. My family was stuck in gridlocked traffic caused by a one-two-punch of bad weather and poor government planning. Midnight approached and my wife told me she hadn't been able to move the car at all since 10 p.m. The half-tank of gas she started with that afternoon had dwindled, and temperatures were well-below freezing. The kids hadn't eaten. There was no restroom in sight. I felt hopeless and helpless. I called Georgia State Patrol and explained to them that my wife and kids were stranded in a vehicle among hundreds of other vehicles. I wanted to know how my family was going to be helped. They told me, ""We don't know sir. We're trying, but we are out-manned now."" Filled with adrenalin, I just couldn't sit idle with my family stranded. I called local authorities and was told the same thing. By this time, I was so angry, I couldn't think straight. I texted a friend who suggested prayer and texted me a bible verse to read, Philippians 4:1-14. I took to social media to help me cope with the situation and people reacted with posts of support. I stayed in touch with my wife a minimum of once per hour and at times twice per hour. On Facebook, I posted: ""More than 14 and a half hours, my wife and kids remain stranded in car stuck in traffic because of snow. Situation is desperate now. Been on phone w/ State police repeatedly who agree w/ me. All prayers are welcome as I'm praying for the safe return of many of my friends in similar situations too."" My wife later told me she cried only once, around 5 a.m., not knowing when she was going to be able to get the children home. She imagined having to wait for days, maybe until the snow and ice melted. It was so, so cold and she couldn't keep the engine running all night for fear of running out of gas. That's also about when I lost it, I told her -- about 5 a.m. At one point an act of kindness gave her hope: A truck driver knocked on the window in the middle of the night offering water and a blanket. She huddled the girls together in the front seat to keep them warm. ""I didn't let the girls see me cry,"" she said. I felt so guilty about it all. Why didn't I fill up the car with gas? Why didn't I get the oil changed? How could I drop the ball on my family? I thought about Gen. Honore, who I have come to admire even more since hearing him talk about leadership and life lessons. I decided it was time to take action. I called the Georgia State Patrol and local authorities one more time. They could offer me very little. I told them if police couldn't get my family , it was time for me to try. The state patrol dispatcher advised me to stay off the roads. It was now 20 hours into the ordeal. At day-break, I told my wife, ""I am coming to get you."" She said she didn't think I could get to her. I said, ""Don't worry about that. Against advice of the local and state authorities, I'm going to try."" I posted a message on Facebook letting folks know what I was going to do and asked for prayers. The reaction came pouring in. I called my neighbor Kenneth Rucker, retired military and current investigator with a local district attorney's office. Taking me in his four-wheel -drive truck, Rucker expertly traversed the thick ice on bridges passing hundreds of stranded vehicles along the way. I was laser focused on the mission: Find my wife and kids and extricate them. I trudged up an ice-covered northbound lane of highway, as Ken's pickup made a zig-zag between hundreds of stranded vehicles to get to a safe stop. I grabbed each of my daughters, and carried them one by one across the median strip to the warmth of Ken's truck. Then I escorted my wife into Ken's vehicle. I moved my wife's car into the median and left it there not knowing or caring when the traffic would start to move. I was leading my family home.","Rick Martin is both father and CNN journalist .

"(CNN) -- Russia sent mixed signals Wednesday on chemical weapons in Syria -- with its foreign ministry pinning the blame for one such attack on a rebel group hours after its president refused to close the door on a U.N.-approved strike against Syria's government. As one of Syria's top allies -- and one with veto power on the U.N. Security Council -- Moscow time and again has stymied efforts to punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government for launching attacks killing innocent civilians and using weaponry derided by the international community. Such calls intensified after an alleged chemical weapons attack last month outside Damascus that, the U.S. government estimates, left upward of 1,400 people dead. French and U.S. legislators spent Wednesday debating the merits of authorizing military strikes in Syria. Russia has challenged assessments from officials in those nations and Great Britain that Syrian forces have used chemical weapons since the bloody civil war broke out in 2011. On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he ""doesn't exclude"" backing a U.N. resolution for military action, though only if there is irrefutable proof Syria's government is behind the latest attack. Samples taken by U.N. inspectors at that site were due at the world body's laboratories this week and will be tested ""strictly according to internationally recognized standards,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. Putin also said, in the same interview with Russia's state Channel 1 television and The Associated Press, that it would be ""absurd"" for al-Assad's forces to use chemical weapons when they have the upper hand over rebel fighters. The Syrian government not only has denied waging chemical weapon attacks, it has accused opposition fighters -- whom it routinely refers to as ""terrorists"" -- of using them. Russia's foreign ministry appeared to echo that view, in at least one instance, on Wednesday. Referencing a March 19 attack (not the one on August 21) in an Aleppo suburb, the ministry said its experts -- in an analysis requested by Syrian authorities -- concluded that 26 civilian and Syrian military deaths from the spring attack can be traced to a ""homemade"" device not used by the Syrian army. The projectile, the Russian ministry stated, was similar to those used in northern Syria by Bashaar Al-Nasr, an Islamist brigade that's part of the opposition Syria Liberation Front. In addition to hexogen, the Russian experts found the nerve agent sarin and another such chemical in its shell and soil samples. 'Red line' debate: Are chemical weapons worse? How this revelation affects the dynamics in Syria, and internationally, is uncertain. U.S. and some allied officials, for example, have expressed reluctance to accept such claims in the past. Moreover, they have indicated their willingness to wage targeted strikes in retaliation to the more recent strike, even without sweeping global support. The competing claims suggest that world leaders -- as has been true in the two years since the conflict began, leading to more than 100,000 deaths according to a U.N. estimate -- aren't close to an agreement about who's to blame for the bloodshed and what to do about it. Nor is there a sense the conflict is near an end. The Local Coordination Committees, a network of opposition activists, reported Syrian forces shelled more than 450 sites Wednesday, contributing to at least 72 more deaths. The official Syrian News Agency, known as SANA, tweeted about Army troops clashes with terrorists, who it blamed for the death of national taekwondo team member Mohammed Ali Nu'meh. Meanwhile, government officials, such as presidential adviser Bouthaina Shaaban, remained critical of efforts of those who might strike without U.N. backing, saying they -- and not the Syrian government -- would pay a steep price. ""The Syrian people will never leave, they will always be here,"" Shaaban said Wednesday on Britain's Channel 4. ""But those who lead the aggression will leave, and they will (live with) the results of this aggression."" French, U.S. lawmakers debate action . Echoing top U.S. officials, French leaders pressed lawmakers in Paris to back a military strike to send a clear message to al-Assad. Five things we learned from Senate hearing on Syria . ""Not to react would be to put peace and security of the entire region in danger, but also beyond that, our own security,"" French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told a combined session of the Senate and National Assembly, arguing that inaction would give those with chemical and nuclear weapons a green light to use them. A similar debate is playing out in Washington, where the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 10 to 7 for a resolution backed by President Barack Obama to authorize a targeted U.S. military action. That decision sends the measure to the full chamber for a vote next week. Read the U.S. Senate draft resolution (.pdf) Secretary of State John Kerry, meanwhile, again made the Obama administration's case Wednesday, this time to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Kerry said some U.S. allies in the Middle East ""have said that, if the United States is prepared to do the whole thing, ... they will carry that cost."" The top U.S. diplomat also stated -- as he has previously -- that a military' strike would be focused on addressing the chemical weapons threat, and that it would be effective. ""We have absolute confidence that what our military undertakes to do, if it is ordered to do so, will degrade the capacity of Assad to use his weapons and serve as a very strong deterrent,"" Kerry said. Yet as was the case a day before with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, not everyone was convinced. Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, claimed most members of the Syrian opposition are ""radical extremists,"" saying that every time he asks U.S. officials about them, ""the answers get worse and worse."" Kerry countered that about 15% of the rebel fighters are ""bad guys"" who fare fighting each other. ""There's a general belief that a real moderate opposition exists"" he added, saying aid in being carefully funneled to this faction which is ""only getting stronger."" Four questions for backers of Syrian mission . Still, even within the Obama administration, there are questions as to how much the rebel movement can be trusted. ""We do not see the clear division between moderates and extremists that some have suggested,"" a U.S. official told CNN, adding that ""all these different elements are mixed in."" Iranian: 'We will support Syria to the end' Obama said last year that the use of chemical weapons in Syria's civil war would cross a ""red line"" for U.S. intervention. International agreements ban the use of chemical weapons, and many Western leaders worry that allowing their use to go unchecked in Syria could weaken that prohibition. ""As much as we're criticized, when bad stuff happens around the world the first question is, 'What is the U.S. going to do about it?'"" Obama told reporters Wednesday in Stockholm, Sweden, after meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt. ""The moral thing to do is not to stand by and do nothing,"" he said. Is it 'High Noon' for Obama on Syria? Not everyone -- including longtime U.S. allies -- agree military action now is the answer. Reinfeldt, for instance, said the world must seek a ""political solution."" Kofi Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general, said there is ""no military solution."" And British lawmakers last week voted to preclude military involvement. Then there are some who are standing firmly by Syria's embattled government. Russia, for one, has historically close economic, political and military ties with Syria, having likely more than $4 billion in contracts with Russia's defense ministry, according to Jeffrey Mankoff, an adjunct fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Russia and Eurasia Program. Moscow also signed a $550 million deal with Syria for combat training jets, and Putin noted that it's given its ally some parts of an air defense missile system but has frozen additional shipments. Iran -- in addition to being one of America and Israel's staunchest foes -- has been al-Assad's biggest backers throughout. On Wednesday, Revolutionary Guard commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani pointed fingers at neighbors such as Qatari for backing what he said was an overwhelmingly foreign rebel fighting force, according to a report in Iran's semi-official Fars news agency. Tehran won't let its friend down, he told Iran's Assembly of Experts. ""We will support Syria to the end,"" Soleimani said. Syria missile strike: What would happen next?

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- After declaring last week that he won't publicly discuss his sexual relationships with staffers again, David Letterman continued his mea culpa Monday night -- saying his wife had been ""horribly hurt by my behavior."" David Letterman has mined private events in his life for very public jokes on his show. The host of CBS' ""Late Show"" said he now has to try to repair his relationship with Regina Lasko. ""Either you're going to make some progress and get it fixed, or you're going to fall short and perhaps not get it fixed, so let me tell you folks, I got my work cut out for me,"" he told the audience. The words came about 15 minutes into the show, but Letterman fired self-deprecating zinger after zinger as soon as he strode on stage and began his opening monologue.  Watch Letterman's apology to his wife » . ""I mean, I'll be honest with you folks,"" he said. ""Right now, I would give anything to be hiking on the Appalachian Trail. I got in the car this morning -- and the navigation lady wasn't speaking to me."" Letterman added it was fall in the city and that he spent the weekend ""raking my hate mail."" ""And it's cold, too,"" he said. ""I mean chilly outside my house, chilly inside my house."" The audience burst into laughter. Monday's show was the first that Letterman had taped since he announced Thursday night that he had sex with unnamed members of his staff and had testified about those liaisons before a New York grand jury as part of an alleged extortion attempt. A CBS producer, Robert ""Joe"" Halderman, is accused of threatening to go public with embarrassing information about Letterman's private life, unless the 62-year-old funnyman ponied up $2 million. While prosecutors did not reveal where Halderman may have gotten information about Letterman's private life, one of the comedian's assistants, identified by Halderman family members and court documents as Stephanie Birkitt, was once the suspect's live-in girlfriend. A highly placed source close to Letterman told CNN that Birkitt was one of the female staffers involved in sexual relationships with the comedian. ""Last week on the show, I told a little story about being blackmailed. I wasn't going to talk about it anymore, but seems like people want to talk about it,"" he said as he began his apology in earnest. ""The staff here has been wonderfully supportive to me, not just through this furor, but through all the years that we've been on television. ... So, again, my thanks to the staff for, once again, putting up with something stupid I've gotten myself involved in,"" he continued. Then he addressed Lasko, whom he began dating in 1986. The couple married in March and have a 5-year-old son together. All the affairs took place before the marriage, Letterman's production company has said. ""Now the other thing is my wife, Regina. She has been horribly hurt by my behavior, and when something happens like that, if you hurt a person and it's your responsibility, you try to fix it."" The show, which airs at 11:30 p.m. ET, is taped earlier in the day. Larry Lefkowitz of Brooklyn Heights, New York, who attended the taping, found Letterman's apology sincere. ""You could tell he'd been though a difficult situation and that he was sorry that he hurt other people, but he was also able to keep it funny, throw humor into it, too,"" Lefkowitz said. Richard Zoglin, an editor at Time magazine and author of ""Comedy at the Edge: How Standup in the 1970s Changed America,"" said he wasn't surprised by Letterman letting the scandal play out in public. ""David, of course, is a very private person. But it's not surprising in the sense that, over the years, what's made David Letterman a fascinating TV personality is how he's allowed us these little peeks into his private life and he's become a more human sort of person, not Mr. Irony, as he started out to be,"" Zoglin said on ""Larry King Live.""  Watch panel discuss Letterman on ""Larry King Live"" » . ""I think that this is just another peek inside the real David Letterman. And it's making him kind of even more fascinating than before."" The suspect in the case, Robert ""Joe"" Halderman of Norwalk, Connecticut, is a 27-year CBS veteran, most recently a producer for the network's news magazine ""48 Hours."" He pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of first-degree attempted grand larceny and has been suspended from his job. If convicted, the 51-year-old could face up to 15 years in prison. Halderman's lawyer, Gerald Shargel, told NBC's ""Today"" show Monday that Letterman's self-disclosure is not the only version of events. ""David Letterman didn't give his side of the story. David Letterman gave what he wanted the public to know,"" Shargel said. ""He wanted to get out ahead of the story and that's exactly what he did. He's a master of manipulating audiences. That's what he does for a living. So to think that David Letterman gave the entire story and there's nothing more to be said is simply wrong."" The flood of attention on the ""sextortion"" revelations -- as they have come to be called -- is unlikely to die down soon, Letterman acknowledged Monday night. ""Ladies and gentleman, this is only phase one of the scandal,"" he joked. ""Phase two? Next week I go on 'Oprah' and sob.""

"(CNN) -- A knife-wielding attacker killed at least two Japanese tourists and wounded 11 others on Tuesday in a tourist district on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, government officials said. The incident took place in Tumon on Guam's west coast, said Andy Gibson, an official in Gov. Eddie Calvo's office. Gibson said three people died and 11 suffered injuries in the ordeal. A spokesperson from Japan's foreign affairs ministry, meanwhile, said that two Japanese tourists were killed and 12 other Japanese were hospitalized. ""(This) represents the worst tragedy that this island has seen in many decades,"" said Mark Baldyga, chairman of the Guam Visitors Bureau board. The bloodshed occurred around 10 p.m. Tuesday (7 a.m. ET Tuesday), when a man drove onto a sidewalk by the Tumon Sands Plaza and Outrigger Guam Resort, according to the Pacific Daily News, the local newspaper. He crashed into a store, left his vehicle and began stabbing people, the newspaper reported. It was not immediately clear how many of the approximately 14 casualties came when the man drove onto the sidewalk and into the store and how many were stabbed. Baldyga called the attack ""an isolated incident,"" albeit one that has greatly shaken those on the island, be they residents or tourists. ""Our hearts go out to the families of the victims,"" he said. ""The people of Guam and the people of Japan have enjoyed a long and close relationship as friends for many decades. The victims will remain in the hearts and prayers of all Guamanians for many years to come."" The visitors bureau official said the ""lone individual"" responsible for the violence was ""immediately apprehended"" by police and ""will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."" The suspect is charged with two counts of murder, 13 counts of attempted murder and 13 counts of aggravated assault, police told the Pacific Daily News newspaper. Guam's economy is heavily dependent on tourism, with much of it coming from Asian countries. The island's official visitors bureau describes Tumon Bay as ""the island's premier resort destination,"" featuring ""luxurious international standard hotels ... set in landscaped gardens on the beach."" The Guam Visitors Bureau has translators at the hospital where the victims were transported, according to Pacific Daily News, a Gannett newspaper. Calvo told the same newspaper that he had reached out to Japanese consular officials after the incident. ""The safety of our visitors and local community is a top priority, and we will continue to provide one of the safest visitor destinations in the world,"" Baldyga said.

"(CNN) -- Egyptians swarmed Cairo's Tahrir Square to demand that their first freely elected leader respect their wishes, hoping to revive a democratic groundswell that swept the country's former strongman from power nearly two years ago. Protesters waved flags and banners, chanted slogans and called on President Mohamed Morsy to roll back last week's decree giving himself expanded presidential powers -- or resign. The crowd included many different Egyptian factions, including Western-style liberals, secularists, moderates and women's rights activists. ""I'm here because this is our country -- all of us,"" one woman told CNN. It's not just for our president."" But Morsy showed no signs of backing down. Egypt's Cabinet chief, Mohamed Refa'a al-Tahtawi, said there will be no retreat from the constitutional decree, state-run EGYNews reported. He reportedly stressed the president would not back down because his move was motivated by democratic aims. There were no official crowd estimates for Tahrir Square. But the square was packed as protesters clogged the roundabout and tents filled the grassy area in the middle. The rally lasted into Wednesday's early hours, with some demonstrators singing and playing drums and guitars while others listened to speeches. Though the protest was mostly peaceful, at least one demonstrator died in early clashes with authorities ahead of Tuesday night's massive rally, the Ministry of Health said. The opposition Popular Alliance Party said the protester died after inhaling excessive amounts of tear gas, which police used in numerous scuffles with rock-throwing protesters on the side streets leading to the square. And in the Nile Delta city of Mahalla, police reported dozens of injuries when demonstrators stormed the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood, Morsy's political movement, Interior Ministry spokesman Alaa Mahmoud told CNN. Police also used tear gas to break up the melees and made numerous arrests, but the building was destroyed, Mahmoud said. Ahmed al-Aguizi, a spokesman for the Freedom and Justice Party -- the Brotherhood's political arm -- said the anti-Morsy protesters carried knives, swords, clubs and guns and battled Brotherhood supporters for four hours. Across the country, 116 people were injured in protests in Cairo and elsewhere, EGYNews reported, citing the Ministry of Health. Protesters are angry with Morsy for his declaration last week that his edicts are beyond the reach of judges in what critics call an unprecedented power grab. A statement Monday night that appeared to at least partially limit the scope of the decree did not seem to salve their anger. On Monday, his office clarified the edict, saying it only applied to ""sovereign matters."" Morsy ""did not give himself judicial power"" but did provide ""immunity for his presidential decisions,"" said Jihad Haddad, a senior adviser in the Freedom and Justice Party. Haddad added that ""the president himself (is) not immune from judicial oversight,"" though it wasn't clear in what instances that would come into practice, or if there was anything preventing Morsy from issuing a new decree so this could not happen. Protesters want to show that ""the whole population of Egypt is against"" Morsy and his backers, said former Finance Minister Samir Radwan. Morsy and his Muslim Brotherhood supporters have defended the policy as necessary to defend the fragile Arab Spring revolution that pushed former President Hosni Mubarak from power and led to the country's first free elections. On Tuesday, the Brotherhood's official Twitter feed dismissed the protests as underwhelming and said what it described as a low turnout indicated a ""lack of support among Egyptians."" But Egyptian journalist Mona Eltahawy said the crowds have turned out to tell Morsy, ""We are your checks and balances."" ""We are the people who will keep you honest, right after you grabbed all of this power for yourself that has made you even more powerful than Mubarak, who we got rid of last year,"" Eltahawy told CNN. ""So, the people are there to say, 'We might have elected you as president, but we did not elect a new dictator.'"" Eltahawy said Egypt's judiciary does need to be ""cleansed"" -- ""but the way to help Egypt toward freedom is not by paving it with dictatorship."" The Muslim Brotherhood scrapped its own demonstration to show support for Morsy -- also scheduled for Tuesday -- ""to avoid any problems due to tension in the political arena,"" said spokesman Mahmoud Ghozlan. But the Muslim Brotherhood Twitter feed told opponents to brace for ""millions in support of the elected prez."" Opinion: Don't blame Muslim Brotherhood for Morsy power grab . Morsy's decree Thursday said that judges can't overturn his decisions or interfere with an Islamist-dominated council writing a new constitution. He also sacked the nation's top prosecutor. In addition to outbursts on the street, Egypt's judges have reacted. All but seven of Egypt's 34 courts and 90% of its prosecutors went on strike Monday in protest, said Judge Mohamed al-Zind of the Egyptian Judge's Club. He described Morsy's edict as ""the most vicious ... attack on the judicial authority's independence."" Edict divides Egypt, unifies opponents . Morsy insists he's trying to protect Egypt's fragile Arab Spring revolution, not accumulate unchecked power. His moves ""cemented the process that would create the institutions that would limit his power, define the constitution and have parliamentary elections so that we can say this is a democracy,"" said Haddad. Senior presidential aide Essam El-Erian called concerns about Morsy's edict overblown, blaming the protests on ""counterrevolutionary forces"" loyal to Mubarak's party. Polls show ""an overwhelming majority supporting President Morsy and his decisions,"" Haddad said Monday. Analysis: Morsy makes his move . But that's not how his political foes -- seen as ""heretics"" by many members of the Muslim Brotherhood, according to Washington Institute for Near East Policy fellow Eric Trager -- look at the situation. Amr Hamzawy, who'd been in the now-dissolved parliament, said action is needed to prevent more ""suffering"" under a president with ""sweeping powers,"" as Egypt had for 60 years under men like Mubarak, Anwar Sadat and Gamal Nasser. ""Morsy is the ... president who has sweeping executive (power), sweeping legislative (power) and ... puts himself above the judicial branch of government,"" said Hamzawy, founder of Egypt's Freedom Party. ""That is a very dangerous mix, which can only lead to a dictatorship."" The rest of the world is watching, too. Former U.S. diplomat Jamie Rubin said Morsy's edict ""brings to mind all the fears that people in that part of the world have had about the Muslim Brotherhood when it comes to democracy."" Morsy to meet with top judicial body . The unrest raises new concerns about stability in Egypt, which has gone through two years of protests and turmoil. ""The majority of the people are really suffering, and they were looking forward to some stability,"" said Radwan, the former finance minister, who served under Mubarak as well as in the government that followed him.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Three people died early Sunday when a helicopter went down on a Southern California property where movies are filmed, a federal aviation official said. The crash occurred around 3:30 a.m. (6:30 a.m. ET) at the Polsa Rosa Movie Ranch in Acton, on the northwestern edge of the Angeles National Forest about 30 miles north of Los Angeles. The Bell 206 Jet Ranger helicopter hit the ground ""under unknown circumstances,"" Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer said, who added that his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating. The three people killed were the only ones aboard, Kenitzer said, citing local authorities.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Uncertainty ruled in Egypt Wednesday as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began and the military said it would address the issues of this week's deadly violence. It wasn't clear whether the religious observance would calm or inflame tensions a week after a military coup. The military, which ousted President Mohamed Morsy from office last week, said that 206 people who had been detained Monday during deadly clashes with security forces face charges of manslaughter, voluntary manslaughter, acts of violence and illegal possession of firearms. The suspects will remain in police custody for another 15 days while investigations into their actions continue. More than 600 people in all were detained Monday. The announcement comes as the military seeks to portray itself as a stabilizing force in the splintering nation. The question remains: Who's on board? Not the Muslim Brotherhood, according to the group's high official of religious law. Grand Mufti Abdulruhman Albir told the Reuters news agency that he does not recognize the authority of the nation's interim president and will not negotiate until Morsy regains power. What is the Muslim Brotherhood? ""Therefore, there is no need to speak about any decrees, because they were issued by people without authority,"" Albir said. That's a direct reference to Interim President Adly Mansour, who has issued a constitutional declaration giving himself limited power to make laws and outlined a timetable for parliamentary and presidential elections, according to state media. The grand mufti's position is important because the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party, won the most seats in parliamentary elections. Morsy was elected president under the Freedom and Justice Party banner. On Wednesday, prosecutors issued arrest warrants for the Brotherhood's chairman, Mohammad Badei, and for the vice chairman of the Freedom and Justice Party, Esam El Arian, state-run Nile TV reported. The Egyptian government said Wednesday that Morsy -- arrested last week during his ouster -- was in a safe place, and that no charges have been filed against him. ""He is not free to go around, but he's treated very well,"" acting Foreign Minister Mohammed Kamel Amr told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""And you understand that this is also for his own safety."" 'Nail in coffin' for Arab Spring? Experts predict Egypt's future . Interim government begins to take shape . Filling other key roles are Hazem El-Beblawi, a liberal economist who was finance minister and deputy prime minister, who will serve as the interim prime minister, and Mohamed ElBaradei, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning diplomat, who will serve as interim vice president, the fledgling government said. MENA, Egypt's official news agency, also reported that cabinet posts will be offered to the Freedom and Justice Party, as well as to the Salafist al-Nour Party. But their participation seems questionable with the Muslim Brotherhood not recognizing the interim government and al-Nour -- which supported Morsy's ouster -- withdrawing from the talks to form an interim government after this week's deadly confrontation between the military and Morsy supporters. Fifty-one people died in the clashes outside Republican Guard headquarters. The military has promised to investigate. Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Ali Ahmed said that even if invited, it could not participate in the interim government. ""More than 700 of our members have been arrested, broadcasters have been shut down, and people killed in front of the Republican Guard,"" he said. ""It is impossible to speak under the current circumstances. There is no way to have negotiations."" ElBaradei: Morsy's ouster was needed so Egypt cannot 'fail' Money pours in . Even as the interim government struggled to unify political support at home, it picked up the financial support of some regional heavyweights -- neither are fans of the Muslim Brotherhood. Saudi Arabia's finance minister said the kingdom has pledged $5 billion in grants and loans to the interim government, according to the official Saudi news agency SAPA. And the United Arab Emirates will give $1 billion to Egypt and lend it another $2 billion as an interest-free central bank deposit, state news agency WAM reported Tuesday. Washington's support . Adly Mansour: Interim president, veteran judge, mystery man . For now, the United States continues to support Egypt financially. The White House has refused to describe as a coup the military's ouster of Morsy, who was reportedly being held under arrest at the Republican Guard headquarters. Doing so would require the United States to suspend its $1.3 billion in annual military aid to Egypt. When is a coup not a coup? It is in the interest of the United States and the Egyptian people ""in their transition to democracy to take the time necessary to evaluate the situation before making such a determination,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday. But he added that U.S. officials were ""cautiously encouraged"" that the interim government's plan ""includes a return to democratically elected government that includes presidential and parliamentary elections."" In response to a question, State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki told reporters that, ""broadly speaking,"" the administration still believes that continuing military aid is a U.S. national security priority. But Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, has called for a suspension of military aid to Egypt. 8 issues Egypt is facing . CNN's Reza Sayah reported from Cairo.

"(CNN) -- Thomas Muller's pre-match remarks could have backfired on him and his Bayern Munich teammates. ""The Bundesliga has already been decided,"" the 24-year-old confidently predicted in an interview with Munich newspaper TZ. ""I don't think anyone is reckoning that we will lose six of our last remaining 12 matches ..."" Make that six of their last 11 as Bayern Munich walloped Schalke 5-1 at the Allianz Arena on Saturday. For the Bundesliga's fourth-placed side it was a forgettable end to a miserable week. After being taken to the cleaners by Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday, Pep Guardiola's side found Schalke's defense in equally accommodating mood come the weekend. David Alaba scored from a free kick in the third minute with Arjen Robben doubling the lead after a quarter of an hour. Mario Mandzukic headed in a third in the 24th minute before Robben's second four minutes later ended any hopes of a Schalke fightback. Four nil had been the scoreline in the corresponding fixture earlier in the season, but Bayern weren't quite finished. Brazilian right-back Rafinha scored an own goal in the 64th minute to gift the visitors a goal, but 12 minutes later Schalke's center back Kyriakos Papadopoulos was shown a straight red for bringing down Mandzukic in the penalty area. Up stepped Robben to claim a hat-trick and round off a depressing week for Schalke manager Jens Keller. With Bayer Leverkusen losing 1-0 at home to Mainz, Bayern extended their lead to 20 points and could be crowned champions by the end of March. Elsewhere, Borussia Dortmund backed up an impressive 4-2 win at Zenit St Petersburg in the Champions League on Tuesday with an 3-0 win against Nurnberg. Second-half goals from Mats Hummels, Robert Lewandowski and Henrik Mkhitaryan move Jurgen Klopp's side up to second with 45 points. In the other matches played Saturday, Werder Bremen beat Hamburg 1-0 while the matches between Augsburg and Hannover and Braunschweig and Monchengladbach both ended in 1-1 draws. Chelsea extend title lead as Arsenal stumble . After registering the only goal and point for English clubs in the last 16 of the Champions League in midweek, Chelsea returned to English Premier League action on Saturday facing west London rivals Fulham. Fulham boss Felix Magath's task of avoiding relegation got a little bit harder after Jose Mourinho's side enjoyed a comfortable 3-1 win at Craven Cottage. A second-half hat-trick by Geman international Andre Schurrle earned Chelsea all three points -- John Heitinga scoring a consolation for the home side -- and a four-point lead at the top of the table. Arsenal would have expected to maintain the one-point deficit with Chelsea as they traveled to Stoke but instead slumped to defeat. A 76th minute penalty by Jonathan Walters ensured Mark Hughes' side scored only a second win in ten matches to boost their survival chances -- victory lifts them to 12th place with 30 points. Whereas Arsene Wenger's side appear to be stalling in the title race, Liverpool continue to score goals for fun and keep their supporters wondering if they can claim their first league title in 24 years. The foundations for an emphatic 3-0 win against Southampton were laid by a Luis Suarez -- the Uruguayan tucking away his first goal in six games in the 16th minute. Raheem Sterling adding a second in the 58th minute before Steven Gerrard's injury time penalty made sure of three points. Brendan Rodgers's team now rise to second ahead of Arsenal on goal difference. Merseyside rivals Everton bounced back from back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win against West Ham United at Goodison Park while Newcastle United's mini-revival continued with a 4-1 win against Hull City at the KC Stadium. But the victory was overshadowed when Newcastle boss Alan Pardew was sent to the stands by the referee after clashing with Hull City's David Meyler. Pardew appeared to head-butt Meyler after the midfielder had brushed past him to retrieve the ball for a throw-in in the 72nd minute. The English Football Association says it will investigate the incident. Manchester City will take Sunderland in the League Cup final at Wembley on Sunday while three league fixtures will also be played with Aston Villa taking on Norwich, Swansea entertaining Crystal Palace and Cardiff traveling to Tottenham Hotspur.

"(CNN) -- A Cessna collided with a parachute at a small airport in Polk County, Florida, on Saturday. The plane took a nose dive, and the skydiver was thrown to the ground. Neither the pilot nor the skydiver were seriously injured when they fell about 75 feet, according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office. Sharon Trembley was doing what are called ""touch and goes"" with the Cessna, a maneuver in which the plane touches the ground and ascends again. The Polk County Sheriff's Department initially identified the pilot as Shannon Trembley. On the pilot's third time up, one wing became tangled in the strings of the parachute that held 49-year-old John Frost, officials said. The pilot and parachutist were taken to a hospital. Frost was treated and released, and Trembley was being held for observation on Saturday night. Officials said the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration were notified and responded to the scene.","A Cessna doing ""touch and goes"" gets caught in a parachute and cuts the cords .

"(CNN) -- Giant panda Lun Lun is pregnant, and officials at the Atlanta, Georgia, zoo say they are thrilled. Animal and veterinary teams estimate that a birth could occur in 10 days to two weeks. It would be the first panda birth in the U.S. this year. Memphis, San Diego and Washington, D.C., zoos also have pandas, but none has produced a baby panda this year. Thirteen-year-old Lun Lun was artificially inseminated, and the father is Zoo Atlanta's Yang Yang. Lun Lun and 13-year-old Yang Yang have already given birth to two cubs -- Mei Lan, a 4-year-old female who now lives in China, and a male, Xi Lan, 2, who resides at Zoo Atlanta. The giant panda is an endangered species, so another birth is good news for the zoo and, of course, the species. ""We're absolutely excited about the news,"" said Rebecca Snyder, the curator of mammals at Zoo Atlanta. ""Many times, zoo handlers are not aware that a panda is pregnant until after the birth, so to know ahead of time is a special treat.""' Lun Lun was artificially inseminated on June 13 after the pair failed to mate naturally. Zoo Atlanta said giant panda gestation periods have been documented to be as short as 83 days or as long as 197 days, and the average pregnancy is 135 days. Ultrasound procedures will track the progress of the developing fetus, zoo officials said. Fans of the panda can watch Lun Lun on the zoo's PandaCam, which runs Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET. Lun Lun and Yang Yang were born in China. They have lived with each other since they were 1 and came as a pair to Zoo Atlanta in 1999. Lun Lun's birth name, given to her by keepers, was Hua Hua, and Yang Yang's birth name was Jiu Jiu.","Zoo Atlanta is soon expecting the first panda birth in U.S. this year .

"Washington (CNN) -- Friday's government report showing a rise in unemployment shines a light on a new hurdle facing young people in need of work: The military isn't the reliable source of employment that it used to be. The Army and Marine Corps are getting smaller, and now there's a nearly year-long waiting list just to get into boot camp, no matter which branch you want to join. The shrinking Army and Marine Corps are part of a long-planned reduction in the size of the armed forces. But the backlog for enlistees is a new issue. Incoming recruits will spend quite a bit of time before they see a Pentagon paycheck. ""Some may take a year or slightly longer, the typical new enlistee would probably be somewhere between 9 and 11 months,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Cynthia Smith wrote in an e-mail. A lot of it has to do with the economy. ""In a tighter job market, young men and women may be more receptive to learning about the many opportunities the military has to offer, from competitive salaries and compensation packages, extraordinary education benefits, to valuable job skills and leadership training,"" Smith said. It's not just a tighter job market that has more people seeking to enlist. Defending America pays better than it used to. ""The average junior enlisted member, typically with just a high school degree, earns approximately $43,000 per year,"" Smith said. And that doesn't include benefits like free medical care and a government-paid retirement package that kicks in with 20 years of active-duty service. Smith said that since the war in Afghanistan began, troop salaries and benefits have jumped significantly. ""From 2002-2010, military pay rose 42%, housing allowances have risen 83%,"" she said. During the same time period, private-sector salaries rose 32%. That, in some ways, is a good thing for the Pentagon, because it allows the services to choose the best possible candidates to defend our country. And the backlog helped former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates end a controversial Army program called stop-loss, in which soldiers were forced to stay in the Army beyond their original enlistment dates in order to fill a personnel shortage. Last month, Gates announced that no more soldiers are being stop-lossed. But for young people who can't, as hard as they try, find a job in the private sector, the backlog means the military isn't the solution they might have hoped for. For example, even if they get in, they may not get the kind of enlistment bonuses that troops got just a few years ago. For example, the Army reports that ""the average amount of bonus has gone down substantially over the past few years,"" said Doug Smith, a spokesman for the Army's recruiting office. He said that in 2008, the average bonus for Army enlistees was more than $18,000. It was less than $6,000 last year. But the services still pay bonuses for hard-to-fill jobs. For example, in the Marines, ""the more challenging the occupational field positions are to fill, the higher the bonus,"" according to recruiting spokesman Maj. John Caldwell. ""Currently, our cryptologic linguists and electronics maintenance technicians get the highest bonus offered at $10,000,"" he said. And don't expect the situation to get much better, at least for the Army and Marines. Both services are on a path to reduce the size of their active-duty forces starting next year. The Army will shrink by about 22,000 people, the Marines by at least 15,000. All that means, if the economy doesn't improve, would-be GIs and leathernecks will be competing with just as many people for even fewer jobs in uniform.","The military isn't the reliable source of employment that it used to be .
The Army and Marine Corps are getting smaller .

"(CNN) -- Although it has been over for nearly a year now, the war in Iraq continued to be a flash point in Monday night's debate between President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. ""You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq,"" said Obama, a Democrat who opposed the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. ""But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now. ... You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day."" But Romney, who supported the invasion, said Obama wanted to keep U.S. troops there longer -- he just couldn't get the Iraqis to go along. Fact Check: Comparing costs of Iraq, Libya missions . ""There was an effort on the part of the president to have a Status of Forces Agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on,"" Romney said. ""You thought it should have been 5,000 troops,"" he told Obama. ""I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what? The answer was we got no troops through whatsoever."" Since the nearly nine-year war remains controversial back home, CNN is taking a closer look at both candidates' claims. The facts: . The Status of Forces Agreement signed between the United States and Iraq in 2008 called for U.S. troops to withdraw from Iraqi cities by 2009 and be out of the country entirely by the end of 2011. Obama opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq while still a state legislator in Illinois and ran for president on a platform of ending that war. But with the 2011 deadline nearing, his administration -- which took office after the agreement was signed -- tried to make arrangements with Iraq to keep between 3,000 and 5,000 Americans in the country to help train Iraqi security forces. Fact Check: Obama's apology tour? ""If they want the benefits of what we can provide, if they want the assistance, if they want the training, if they want the operational skills that we can provide, then I think they have to understand that they've got to give us some protections in that process,"" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in October 2011. Those talks failed when the Iraqis refused to grant legal immunity for U.S. troops, and the last U.S. convoy left Iraq in December 2011. Obama touted that as a promise kept, saying Americans would be leaving ""with their heads held high."" The president also has touted that as a promise kept during his re-election campaign. But Romney has consistently criticized the Obama administration for its failure to reach a deal with the Iraqi government on keeping those troops there. In December 2011, with the final pullout looming, Romney told Fox News Sunday that the Obama administration was ending the American presence ""in a precipitous way, and we should have left 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 personnel there to help transition to the Iraqis' own military capabilities."" Two weeks before Monday night's debate, in a speech at the Virginia Military Institute, Romney said the ""costly gains"" made in Iraq were slipping away. Fact Check: Is al Qaeda's core decimated or growing? ""And yet, America's ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence,"" he said. ""The president tried -- and failed -- to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains."" Conclusion: . Each man's attacks are rooted in fact. The Obama administration did attempt, unsuccessfully, to extend the presence of a scaled-back U.S. training mission in Iraq, while Romney has said Washington should have kept a considerably larger force in Baghdad.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A former Los Angeles cop with military training vowed war against other men in blue Thursday, leaving one officer dead days after he allegedly killed two other people to begin a wave of retribution for being fired, police said. The focus of the intensive, expansive manhunt is Christopher Jordan Dorner, a 270-pound former Navy lieutenant who has professed his venom against LAPD officers he claimed ruined his life by forcing him out of his dream job. Dorner blames one retired officer for bungling his appeal to get his job back in an 11-page manifesto, in which he also complained of mistreatment by the LAPD. In that letter -- provided to CNN by an LAPD source -- he vowed to violently target police officers and their families, whoever and wherever they are. ""I will bring unconventional and asymmetrical warfare to those in LAPD uniform whether on or off duty,"" Dorner wrote. ""I never had the opportunity to have a family of my own, I'm terminating yours."" Authorities believe he followed through on his threats early Thursday by shooting a Riverside, California, police officer and two others. A day earlier, Irvine police named Dorner a suspect in the double slayings Sunday of a woman -- identified by Los Angeles police as the daughter of a retired LAPD officer -- and her fiance. ""My opinion of the suspect is unprintable,"" said Riverside police Chief Sergio Diaz, hours after one of his officers was killed. ""The manifesto, I think, speaks for itself (as) evidence of a depraved and abandoned mind and heart."" The violence, as well as Dorner's background as a police officer and military trained marksman, left police on edge around Southern California. In Torrance, LAPD officers guarding one of Dorner's alleged targets mistakenly opened fire on a blue pickup truck that resembled one Dorner was thought to be driving, said Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck. The gunfire left two people wounded, Beck said. Torrance police also fired on another blue pickup, but no one was injured in that incident, according to a senior law enforcement source. In downtown Los Angeles, police wearing body armor patrolled outside their own iconic headquarters. Police have good reason to be fearful, the chief said. ""Of course, he knows what he's doing. We trained him,"" Beck said. ""He was also a member of the armed forces. It is extremely worrisome and scary, especially to the officers involved."" The manhunt for Dorner spanned hundreds of miles and numerous counties. By Thursday afternoon, it was largely centered around Big Bear Lake -- about 100 miles east of Los Angeles -- where authorities found the truck the suspect allegedly used in the Riverside shooting. KTLA: Manhunt for former cop after officers shot . Police confirmed that the vehicle, which was burnt out when it was found, belonged to Dorner by its vehicle identification number, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said. This discovery spurred more officers to converge on the area to conduct beefed up patrols, staff checkpoints and go to every residence in the mountain community. McMahon acknowledged the fire may have been set as a diversionary tactic, though law enforcement isn't taking any chances. Early Thursday evening, he said that aerial and K9 searches on the ground will ""continue as long as we can"" -- though snow is coming -- and urged locals to be on alert. ""He could be anywhere at this point, and that's why we're searching door to door,"" the sheriff said. 1 cop dies in 'cowardly ambush' It all started Sunday when Dorner allegedly killed two people in Irvine, according to police. Police identified the victims as Monica Quan and her fiance Keith Lawrence. Quan, 27, was the daughter of retired Los Angeles police Officer Randal Quan, LAPD Officer Tenesha Dobine told CNN. In his manifesto, Dorner said Quan handled his appeal. On Tuesday, Dorner checked into the Navy Gateway Inns and Suites on San Diego's large naval base, Cmdr. Brad Fagan said. Dorner likely had access to the hotel because he'd been honorably discharged from the Navy Reserve, said the Navy spokesman. Having retired February 1 as a lieutenant, Dorner worked with mobile inshore undersea warfare units and provided security on oil platforms in Iraq, according to Pentagon records. He was rated as a rifle marksman and pistol expert. ""He did not physically check out"" Wednesday as expected, Fagan told reporters. Police in San Diego say a man who could have been Dorner tried to hijack a boat there on Wednesday. Someone later found a wallet containing Dorner's identification and an LAPD detective's badge near the San Diego airport, according to police. It was unclear whether the badge was legitimate. Timeline in manhunt for former L.A. cop . By about 1 a.m. Thursday, the scene had shifted about 100 miles north to Corona, California. There, a pair of LAPD officers on a protection detail were flagged down by a citizen who reported seeing the suspect's vehicle, LAPD Deputy Chief Jose Perez said. The officers chased the vehicle and caught up to it on an Interstate 15 off-ramp. ""The officers were fired upon with a shoulder weapon,"" Perez said, with one of them suffering a ""graze wound"" to his head. The police returned fire, while the suspect set off once again. About 20 minutes later, two police officers were in their car at a stop light in Riverside when Dorner allegedly pulled up beside them. That driver unleashed ""multiple rounds"" from a rifle at the officers, riddling the cop car with bullets and leaving a 34-year-old officer, who had been on the Riverside force for 11 years, dead, according to Diaz. The other officer, 27, was ""seriously wounded but we expect a full recovery,"" the Riverside police chief said. KCBS: Riverside officer fatally shot . It was ""a cowardly ambush,"" said Diaz, claiming Dorner has ""no connection"" to his city. A good Samaritan picked up one of their police radios and called dispatchers to send help, Riverside police said. Suspect calls attacks 'a necessary evil' In addition to posting his manifesto online, Dorner reached out directly to CNN, mailing a parcel to AC360 anchor Anderson Cooper's office at CNN in New York. The package arrived on February 1 and was opened by Cooper's assistant. Inside was a hand-labeled DVD, accompanied by a yellow Post-it note reading, in part, ""I never lied"" -- apparently in reference to his 2008 dismissal from the LAPD. The package also contained a coin wrapped in duct tape. The tape bears the hand-written inscription: ""Thanks, but no thanks, Will Bratton."" It also had letters that may be read as ""IMOA"", which could be a commonly used Internet abbreviation for ""Imagine a More Open America,"" or possibly ""1 MOA,"" which means one minute of angle, perhaps implying Dorner was notably accurate with a firearm. The coin is a souvenir medallion from former LAPD Chief William Bratton, of a type often given out as keepsakes. This one, though, was shot through with bullet holes: three bullet holes to the center and another shot nicked off the top. The editorial staff of AC360 and CNN management were made aware of the package Thursday. Upon learning of its existence, they alerted Bratton and law enforcement. Bratton headed the LAPD at the time Dorner was dismissed. The dispute centers on a 2007 incident in San Pedro involving a man's arrest at a DoubleTree hotel. Two weeks later, Dorner accused his training officer of kicking the man after he'd given up. The investigators' report said ""the delay in reporting the alleged misconduct coupled with the witness' statements irreparably destroy Dorner's credibility."" The report cited contradictory accounts from the arrested man and his father and denials by the accused officer and three hotel employees that the arrested man had been kicked. Dorner claims he was wrongly ousted for blowing the whistle on what he insists was police abuse. Suspect's grudge dates back to 2007 complaint . Dorner challenged his firing for years, losing at every turn. First, the police department's Board of Rights rejected his appeal. Then, in October 2011, a judge ruled against his appeal, according to court records. Beck, the Los Angeles police chief, said Thursday that Dorner's case had been ""thoroughly reviewed"" and said the department would not apologize to Dorner or clear his name. But as his manifesto shows, Dorner is showing no sign of relenting. He complained he had been railroaded out of the department after reporting police brutality by another officer. Dorner also complained of a continuing culture of racism and brutality in the LAPD. Attacks on other police officers and their families, he said, are ""a necessary evil that I do not enjoy but must partake and complete for substantial change to occur within the LAPD and reclaim my name."" ""Look your wives/husbands and surviving children directly in the face and tell them the truth as to why your children are dead,"" Dorner wrote. Such a chilling warning prompted Los Angeles police to set up 40 protective details in an effort to safeguard people listed in Dorner's letter, Beck said. The chief acknowledged that this effort was taxing the department, which has been placed under tactical alert, meaning all officers must stay on duty. ""It's extremely, extremely manpower intensive,"" Beck said. ""But the safety of my employees, people that come on the job to protect the lives of strangers, is extremely important to me. And I will expend whatever resource is necessary."" KABC: Former cop shoots three officers .

"PICHER, Oklahoma (CNN) -- In a year marked by massive flooding, deadly tornadoes and blazing wildfires, Tad Skylar Agoglia has never been needed more. This week, he's on the scene in Iowa. Tad Agoglia started the nonprofit First Response Team of America to help clean up areas hit by disaster. Agoglia is the founder of The First Response Team of America, his self-funded, nonprofit, nomadic, four-man cleanup crew that provides immediate, emergency aid to areas hit by disasters. Since May 2007, the team has helped thousands of victims at 15 disaster sites across the United States and has rapidly become a recognized name in first responder aid. ""The most critical phase of a disaster is the first few days,"" Agoglia says. ""That's when you have to find the people that are in desperate need of medical attention, food, water."" Agoglia bases that conclusion on more than four years of on-the-scene experience. When his company, Disaster Recovery Solutions, was hired to clean up after storms like Hurricane Katrina, he noted that days -- even weeks -- routinely passed before authorities began establishing recovery operations. Local response officials were often debilitated by a loss of resources, and aid organizations arriving early on the scene with water, medical care and food were unable to reach those in need because of road-blocking debris or flooding. ""I got this crazy idea to use one of my cranes to respond immediately to a disaster and just open up roads,"" Agoglia recalls. ""So I deployed equipment immediately. And sure enough, there was a need."" During a year in which the country has suffered unprecedented storm numbers and damage, needs are only escalating. ""Initially, I thought I'd respond to one or two storms a year for free,"" says Agoglia. ""But the demand has been so great, I couldn't say no."" Agoglia has continued to develop his arsenal of equipment to meet that demand. The First Response Team consists of more than $1 million in specialized machinery able to adapt to the various challenges of disaster sites. Each of two 75-foot max trucks can hold up to eight average dump trucks' worth of debris and has a high-speed crane with interchangeable heads that can lift, crush and cut its way through collapsed buildings in 20 minutes to an hour. ""Especially when little towns get hit, there's not much assistance for them,"" Agoglia says. ""With my equipment, I can come in and clean up the whole town in two days."" Agoglia hauls a multi-terrain hovercraft, dirt bikes, satellite phones with GPS tracking, a huge generator and a large water pump.

"(CNN) -- Syrian rebel fighters said Friday they have captured a strategic northern military base used by the government to bomb opposition strongholds. Rebel fighters and militants from various Islamic groups, including the jihadist al-Nusra Front, took part in the offensive, an opposition spokesman said. They've seized control of buildings, ammunition and military equipment at the base in Idlib province, the opposition said, signaling a major blow to President Bashar al-Assad's forces. ""They are taking credit now for having taken the air base,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters Friday. ""And, as you know, we consider this significant on two fronts. ""First of all, to ground some of the air assets of the Assad regime that they've been using against civilians. And, secondly, to break their ability to resupply in the north.""

The strategic base has been used by government forces to send explosives to areas in the north, according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In addition to housing about government 400 soldiers, the group said, warplanes that attack the region were taking off from there. ""The Taftanaz air base has been completely liberated,"" said Hamza Abu Hussam, a spokesman for the Binnish Coordination Committee, a local opposition group.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video. Brahimi: No military solution . The U.N. and Arab League special envoy to Syria stressed Friday that there is ""no military solution"" to the brutal civil war being fought in the Arab nation. Lakhdar Brahimi made the remark after meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns at the United Nations offices in Geneva, Switzerland. ""We are all very, very deeply aware of the immense suffering of the Syrian people which has gone for far too long. And we all stressed the need for a speedy end to bloodshed, the destruction, and all forms violence in Syria,"" he said. ""We stressed again, in our view, there is no military solution to this conflict."" Syria accused Brahimi of bias Thursday, casting a shadow on efforts to end a war that, according to the United Nations, has killed more than 60,000 people in nearly two years. Brahimi has ""deviated from the essence of his mission and clearly unveiled his bias to circles known for conspiring against Syria and the interests of the Syrian people,"" Syrian state media reported. The statement from Damascus was a response to a BBC interview in which Brahimi in effect called on al-Assad to resign. He said the president would have no place in the transition to a post-conflict Syria. ""I think what people are saying is, a family ruling for 40 years is a little bit too long,"" Brahimi said, according to the interview Thursday. Al-Assad took over from his late father, who seized power in 1970 and ruled for three decades. Brahimi said both the United States and Russia want to help end the war and forge a future. The United States long has called for al-Assad to resign. Russia, which historically has had close ties with Syria, has blocked tough action against the government in the U.N. Security Council. ""I'm absolutely certain the Russians are as preoccupied as I am, as Americans are, by the bad situation that exists in Syria and its continuing deterioration, and I'm absolutely certain they would like to contribute to its solution,"" he said. He cited the ""absolute necessity"" for pushing for a peaceful solution. ""It is the wider international community,"" he said, particularly Security Council members, who ""can really create the opening that is necessary to start effectively solving the problem."" Securing chemical weapons . The escalating conflict and the president's efforts to retain his grip on power have sparked a push to ensure that chemical weapons are secure. U.S. officials say they are working with nations in the Middle East to secure Syria's chemical and biological weapons sites. ""We're not talking about ground troops, but it depends on what ... happens in a transition,"" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Thursday. Asked whether he had ruled out putting U.S. troops in Syria to secure such weapons, Panetta said: ""You always have to keep the possibility that, if there is a peaceful transition and international organizations get involved, that they might ask for assistance in that situation. But in a hostile situation, we're not planning to ask for that."" Russian navy holding exercises off Syria's coast . Ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet are heading to the eastern Mediterranean for exercises, the Russian Defense Ministry said. A tactical group of Black Sea Fleet warships, headed by the cruiser Moskva, will undertake exercises in the eastern sector of the Mediterranean Sea. The tanker Ivan Bubnov has fueled the ships, and emergency drills have been carried out for the upcoming exercises. The tanker filled up on fuel and water Thursday at the Cyprus port of Larnaka. A Baltic Fleet group consisting of the patrol vessel Yaroslav Mudry and tanker Lena will head for the eastern Mediterranean, where the two ships will practice stores transfers at sea. The patrol vessel will carry out anti-submarine warfare drills. Russia has a maintenance naval base at Tartus on the coast. No let-up in refugee flight . The United Nations said Friday that more than 612,000 people have been registered as Syrian refugees or are ""being assisted as such."" There were 194,769 in Lebanon, 176,569 in Jordan, 153,163 in Turkey, 69,282 in Iraq, 13,292 in Egypt and 5,059 elsewhere in North Africa, the U.N. refugee agency said. ""Even with the winter preparation work that has been done in recent months, many refugees in both camp and noncamp situations are facing particularly cold and damp conditions. At the same time, there has been no let-up in the numbers of people fleeing Syria into neighboring countries,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. Mia Farrow to meet refugees . Actress and UNICEF goodwill ambassador Mia Farrow will visit Lebanon next week to meet with Syrian refugees, the organization said Friday. ""As part of her mission she will appeal for additional international assistance as the needs and numbers of those fleeing Syria continue to rise,"" UNICEF said. Farrow will travel to two locations near the Syrian border to meet with refugees and host families. ""Ms. Farrow will also help distribute winter clothing while there as many of the refugees fled Syria with very few belongings."" Brutal winter weather is making dire conditions even more so in parts of the Middle East, especially for thousands of Syrian refugees enduring frigid temperatures in tents. More deaths . The Syrian crisis started in March 2011, when peaceful protesters demanding democracy and reforms were met by a fierce government crackdown, which spiraled into an armed opposition movement and a civil war. At least 106 people were killed Friday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Among them were 40 people killed in shelling by artillery and jet fighters in Hasaka province, in the northeastern part of the country. Read more: By the numbers: Syria deaths .

"(CNN) -- Naloxone. It's the name of a potentially lifesaving drug designed to reverse opioid prescription drug and heroin overdoses. In one case last month, a pair of New York City police officers put it to the test and saw it work. ""We used the naloxone, we injected it into his nose, shortly ... after about 20 to 30 seconds, he ... started breathing and his eyes opened,"" NYPD officer Kevin Kouroupos told CNN. Heroin-related deaths increased 84% from 2010 to 2012 in New York City and involved 52% of all overdose deaths in 2012, according to the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The problem is particularly bad on Staten Island, where the death rate from overdoses is almost three times higher than the rest of New York City, according to the agency. ""I do think that every police officer should have it,"" Kouroupos said. As part of a pilot program launched in December, a group of NYPD officers on Staten Island is armed with naloxone nasal spray and trained to use it at the sign of an overdose. ""The pilot was selected for Staten Island where the mortality rate from overdose is 7.4 per 100,000 compared to 2.4 per 100,000 citywide,"" New York City's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said in a news release Thursday. Long Island sees exploding heroin use . This marks a greater push across the nation to get naloxone in the hands of first-line responders, emergency medical technicians and other overdose witnesses. That effort has gotten a lot more attention since the death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, who overdosed on heroin on February 2. As of 2010, naloxone was distributed in 15 states and the District of Columbia. Notable cities and states that use it include Baltimore and Chicago, and New Mexico, Massachusetts, Michigan, California and New York, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Naloxone distribution programs train potential overdose witnesses to correctly recognize an overdose and administer the drug, enabling bystanders to save more lives. ""You need to have somebody else there to actually give the medication,"" Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent, said on ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" on Tuesday. ""The kit is a couple vial syringes, and it comes with instructions."" The Department of Health recommends administering naloxone directly to an individual overdosing after calling 911 and checking for breathing. The overdose antidote can be administered via needle or as a nasal spray. ""The goal is get these in the hands of people who might potentially benefit from them,"" Gupta said. From 1996 to 2010, more than 53,000 people were trained in naloxone administration and overdose response, and more than 10,000 lives have been saved because of overdose reversals, as reported by the CDC in 2012. Naloxone is funded by city and state health departments, which then distribute the antidote through hospitals and community-based programs at no cost, according to the CDC. Community-based programs include San Francisco's Drug Overdose Prevention and Education Project and Massachusetts' Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution. Initiatives to expand the availability of naloxone are under way as the uptick in heroin use reverberates nationally. Since 2012, the Food and Drug Administration has publicly discussed making naloxone for over-the-counter use in hopes of reducing overdose fatalities. On Tuesday, a new bill was introduced in the New York State Legislature to allow health care professionals to prescribe naloxone to a person at risk of experiencing an overdose, or to a family member, friend or other overdose witness. What is naloxone, and how does it work? When someone takes heroin, the drug locks on to receptors in the brain, slows the body down and disrupts breathing, Gupta said. Naloxone can rapidly free up those receptors and restore consciousness and normal breathing, essentially bringing the overdose victim back to life. More on just how heroin can turn you into a corpse . First approved by the FDA in 1971, naloxone has been used safely and effectively for more than 40 years in ambulances and emergency rooms across the country, according to the Drug Policy Alliance. Every day in the United States, 105 people die as a result of drug overdoses involving heroin or pharmaceutical opioids, according to the CDC. With more than 30,000 deaths annually, accidental overdose has overtaken car accidents as our country's leading cause of accidental death for people 25 to 64, as reported by the CDC. In Portsmouth, New Hampshire, a town of just 22,000 residents, three overdoses were reported in just 24 hours earlier this month. One of the overdoses resulted in a death, said Capt. Mike Schwartz of the Portsmouth Police Department. In January, at least 22 people in western Pennsylvania died after using heroin that had been mixed with fentanyl, a powerful narcotic used to treat cancer patients' pain, CNN's Rosa Flores reported. The drug cocktails were being sold under harmless-sounding names, such as ""Theraflu"" and ""Bud Ice."" At the start of the New Year, Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont devoted his 2014 State of the State address to the state's heroin problem, calling on law enforcement, medical personnel and Vermont families ""to take action before the quality of life that we cherish so much is compromised."" South Beach-Tottenville on Staten Island was among the five New York City neighborhoods with the highest rate of heroin poisoning deaths from 2011 to 2012, according to a Health Department report from September 2013. ""The problem is so mainstream. This is Main Street. This is Staten Island here. It knows no boundaries,"" Luke Nasta told CNN. He's the executive director of the Camelot residential rehabilitation program on Staten Island, which also sponsors rehab programs throughout New York's five boroughs. So how did the problem rise to epidemic proportions? These days, heroin is a cheaper alternative to opioids, according to the NYC Department of Health. The nationwide crackdown on prescription pill abuse has made those drugs harder and more expensive to get. As a result, heroin has become a common substitute for prescription pills. Nasta suggests this is the reason why heroin use has skyrocketed on Staten Island. ""It's worse because the prescription opioid pill problem was worse -- so that morphs into heroin addiction,"" Nasta told CNN. ""In 2012, doctors and law enforcement tightened up on doctor shopping and the availability of prescription drugs -- people moved to heroin. As early as 2012, we saw a reduction in overdose deaths for prescription opioids, but the heroin overdose rate went up dramatically."" Nasta says every five days, someone on Staten Island dies from an unintentional heroin overdose. One in 10 overdoses results in death, he says. ""As they tighten up on the prescription drugs, the heroin marketers put out a product that is potent and inexpensive,"" Nasta said. ""The person who is accustomed to getting opiate pills from friends, in a single-family house, are now strapping and putting in a hypodermic needle. Their whole world changes."" And the typical user group is not one you'd expect, he says. ""You have a high school tennis player, with a seriously hurt elbow or ankle -- and there you go, here's 90 heroin tablets, good luck."" Nasta says friends and family members of addicts should all have naloxone and be prepared to use it. ""It's not going to address the problem, but it will save some lives."" Are users thinking about naloxone? It's difficult to determine whether users have considered naloxone as a fail-safe for continued drug abuse. But one addict in recovery says he never thought about the possibility of overdosing while using. ""I mean, I knew about the naloxone, but I just didn't think overdose would happen to me -- so I wasn't really too worried about it when I was using."" For a third time now, Nick, who asked not to share his last name, is in rehab for a heroin addiction that has ruled his life. He never stopped to think it could actually end his life. ""I didn't think about overdosing. I wanted to get high, you know, any means to get it or do it,"" the 22-year-old told CNN as he reflected in the common room at the Camelot residential rehab facility. Nick began using at 15. ""I was using marijuana at first and then over time became curious about other things, and I started using prescription painkillers. I was using those for about two years, and then I had switched over to heroin because the pills were getting harder to find and very expensive -- and heroin was half the price and did the same job."" he explained. Nick says he'll fight to stay clean when he leaves rehab in the next three months. ""I have a lot of goals that I set for myself that I would love to accomplish, and I want to see myself very successful when I get older."" If he can, he'd like to go to college. He says he wishes more addicts had his opportunity to recover.

"(CNN) -- The phrase ""digital detox"" was added to the Oxford Dictionaries Online in August 2013 along with, interestingly enough, the term FOMO, or the fear of missing out, often brought on by posts to social media. It seems that the former is an ideal cure for the latter: a digital detox from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and all the other stimuli that surround us constantly is a perfect way to shake that fear of missing out—and put that energy toward something personally worthwhile. ""Unplugging gives our brains a chance to slow down. Our blood pressure goes down. It gives us a chance to think for ourselves,"" says Levi Felix, California-based cofounder of The Digital Detox, which leads device-free retreats. ""When you're not looking at a screen, sharing something, considering what everyone else is doing in the moment, you get to be who you are."" Hotels from Chile to Canada to the Caribbean now offer similar getaways that encourage travelers to unplug. Often devices are banned, and days are filled with meditation, yoga, nature, and communal activities. Whether these packages are examples of bandwagon thinking (like ""eco-resorts"" that simply don't wash towels and linens daily) or a true reflection of travelers' yearning to break their habits is still unclear. But Felix is optimistic. ""Hey, if you're staying in a hotel or somewhere where there's less cell phone use and they're promoting massage and yoga, that's an awesome shift in culture,"" he says. ""When you successfully unplug, you'll have more awareness about yourself; you'll be more in touch."" New Camaldoli Hermitage, Big Sur, CA .

"LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters)  -- Massive dogs belonging to ""Mission: Impossible"" star Ving Rhames attacked and killed a live-in caretaker at the actor's Los Angeles home Friday, police said. A sign on the gate of actor Ving Rhames' home points out that a dog is on the premises. The caretaker, whose name was not released by authorities, was found dead on the front lawn of Rhames' gated home in an expensive Brentwood neighborhood, covered in dog bites, a Los Angeles police spokesman said. Several large dogs were running loose on the property when police responded to the scene shortly after 7:15 a.m. (10:15 a.m. ET) and animal control officers took three huge bull mastiffs and an English bulldog into custody. ""It appeared that the person suffered a number of injuries as a result of the dog mauling,"" Sgt. Lee Sands said. ""There were numerous dog bites all over his body, but the exact cause of death is pending the coroner's ruling."" Sands said four dogs, the largest weighing nearly 200 pounds, were being quarantined as part of an investigation into the attack. He said it was not yet clear how many of the dogs had taken part in the mauling or why they had turned on the caretaker. The victim, who worked for Rhames for two years and lived on the property, was pronounced dead at the scene. Television pictures showed the body being removed from the scene, covered in a blanket. Neighbors said that they had never seen signs of aggression from the dogs. Representatives for Rhames, who is out of the country shooting a film, had no immediate comment. The 46-year-old actor is known for starring in ""Pulp Fiction"" and alongside Tom Cruise in all three ""Mission: Impossible"" movies. Rhames has a long list of film and television credits. He won a Golden Globe and Emmy nomination for starring as Don King in a 1997 TV movie about the flamboyant boxing promoter. The actor discussed dogs during a 1999 interview with the Los Angeles Times, describing a 1-year-old Fila Brasileiro (Brazilian Mastiff) he owned at the time as having been bred to guard slaves.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Kanye West appeared to blame the pain of his mother's death two years ago for his ""rude"" behavior at Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards. Kanye West took the microphone from Taylor Swift during her speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The rapper told Jay Leno he would now ""take some time off"" to think about how he will ""make it through the rest of this life."" West's appearance on Monday's prime-time premiere of ""The Jay Leno Show"" capped a 24-hour period that began Sunday evening with him strolling down the red carpet at New York's Radio City Music Hall while gulping from a bottle of Cognac. The low-light came about an hour later, when West jumped onstage and grabbed the microphone from singer Taylor Swift as she accepted the Best Female Video award. West declared that Beyonce Knowles should have won.  Watch West grab the microphone from Swift » . West appeared sober and humble when he spoke on Leno's Los Angeles stage Monday, an appearance that was originally to be just musical. ""I immediately knew in this situation that it was wrong,"" West told Leno. ""And it wasn't a spectacle, you know. It was actually someone's emotions, you know, that I stepped on and it was very, it was just, it was rude, period.""  Watch Kanye try to make amends » . When Leno asked West what his mother would have thought of his behavior, he fell silent for more than a dozen seconds and appeared near tears. Leno pressed him again. ""Would she be disappointed in this? Would she give you a lecture?"" West gave a rambling, emotional answer: . ""Yeah, you know, obviously, you know, I deal with hurt and, you know, so many, you know, celebrities, they never take the time off, and I've never taken the time off to really, you know, I just, music after music and tour after tour on tour, and I'm just ashamed that my hurt caused someone else's hurt."" West said he wasn't trying to justify his behavior, ""because I was just in the wrong. That's clear."" ""But I need to, after this, just to take some time off and analyze how I'm going to, you know, make it through the rest of this life, how I'm going to improve,"" he said. ""Because, I am a celebrity and that's something I have to deal with."" He said he would like to personally apologize to Swift, a 19-year-old pop-country singer. ""And if there's anything I can do to help Taylor in the future or help anyone, I want to live this thing. It's hard sometimes, so."" West then joined fellow hip-hop superstars Jay-Z and Rihanna to perform ""Run This Town,"" a song they recorded together. The timing of West's antics came at a good time for Leno, who embarked on a new era of his career Monday. After 17 years of hosting ""The Tonight Show,"" Leno debuted his 10 p.m. weeknight talk show on NBC. Apologies from celebrities behaving badly have boosted Leno's ratings.

"(CNN) -- The same dementia-like disease found in the brain tissue of several National Football League players has shown up in the brains of four U.S. veterans exposed to improvised explosive devices and other head trauma, according to new research. The suggestion made by the research is that a common thread binds those exposed to traumatic brain injury, whether it occurs on the football field or in the war theater. ""We found the same changes (the same damage to the brain) in veterans just as we did in athletes,"" said Dr. Ann McKee, a study co-author and director of the Neuropathology Service for VA New England Healthcare System. ""This is interesting and intriguing."" Two of the military cases, and a group of mice studied concurrently by researchers, suggest that a single IED exposure could instigate the cluster of abnormal protein in the brain that characterizes the disease, called chronic traumatic encephalopathy. CTE derives some of its notoriety from cases like that of Dave Duerson, a former Chicago Bear who shot himself in the chest in 2011 and was found to have dense clusters of tau protein permeating his brain and spinal cord. Tau is released by neurons when the brain is rocked inside the skull and, when unleashed, tends to lodge in parts of the brain responsible for memory, judgment and mood. The same group of researchers at the Boston University School of Medicine who examined Duerson's brain excised thin slivers of brain tissue from four U.S. veterans who died suddenly. Those were compared to tissue taken from two other groups: three amateur football players and a professional wrestler with a history of concussion; and a control group of four young people who died suddenly with no history of concussion. What tends to confuse these cases is the inability to isolate the effects of an IED blast. Veterans included in the study had been exposed to IED blasts between one and six years before their deaths, but some had also sustained accident or sports-related concussions. Questions are then raised about whether the blast itself or the history of concussion -- or both -- contributes to CTE. ""It's a little like trying to figure out the plot of a film by looking at the last frame,"" said Dr. Lee Goldstein, associate professor at Boston University School of Medicine and Boston University College of Engineering.Â ""You have an idea about how the ending occurred, but you don't know the plot line that got you there."" That's where the mouse study comes in. ""What the mouse study does is ask a very specific question lingering in the field, which is, can exposure to even a single blast result in brain damage that persists and possibly progresses?"" Goldstein said. To answer that question, researchers exposed a group of mice to blast winds -- some up to 330 miles per hour -- that mimic what might occur in the wake of an IED blast and compared them to a group of mice the same age, living in the same conditions, that were not exposed to blasts. The effect of the blast is described by researchers as a ""bobblehead effect,"" the brain rocking back and forth inside the skull, similar to what happens during a concussion, and in some people it leads to brain damage. Two weeks after exposure to the blast, brain tissue in mice showed evidence of tau protein. ""We were expecting the effect after multiple exposures,"" Goldstein said. ""We were not anticipating this."" ""They have definitively shown that blasts and shaking of the head gives you the same pathology seen in sports concussions,"" said Dr. Jack Tsao, a Navy commander, neurologist and director of traumatic brain injury programs for the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.Â  ""The mouse model then gives you a potential for investigating the cause of what's happening. ""It's an important first step in raising further awareness of this issue,"" Tsao added. Some military cases were notable for overlapping of symptoms reported by football players later diagnosed with CTE -- including headaches, irritability, difficulty sleeping and depression -- and for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder before death. The research also raises questions about a potential subgroup of veterans returning from the war with a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury. ""It's safe to say right now that we're not sure what the overlaps are,"" said McKee, a professor at Boston University School of Medicine.Â  ""Most people feel there is an overlap, and some cases of PTSD will be accounted for by CTE, but not all."" ""The authors speculate that there may be a link,"" Tsao said. ""It is very interesting to think this is going on and certainly well worth looking into, but ... there is no direct evidence yet based on what we've seen."" Study authors acknowledge limitations of their cases series -- published online Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine -- including a small study size and obvious anatomical differences between mice and humans, but they believe they have enough information based on the study to move toward developing therapies to address CTE. ""That is the burning question that needs to be addressed now,"" Goldstein said.","Dementia-like disease in brain tissue of NFL players shows up in four veterans .

"Washington (CNN) -- Concerned over the rise in heroin overdose deaths, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is vowing to increase efforts to fight what he called an ""urgent public health crisis."" In a video released Monday, Holder said the increased efforts will not only include law enforcement activity, but also treatment and efforts to keep people off the deadly drug. ""It's clear that opiate addiction is an urgent -- and growing -- public health crisis. And that's why Justice Department officials, including the (Drug Enforcement Administration), and other key federal, state, and local leaders, are fighting back aggressively,"" Holder said, adding that heroin overdoses increased by 45 percent between 2006 and 2010. Are heroin death probes created equal? One of the main efforts, Holder said, was to attack the problem by combating highly addictive prescription pills, which studies show often lead to heroin use. ""With DEA as our lead agency, we have adopted a strategy to attack all levels of the supply chain to prevent pharmaceutical controlled substances from getting into the hands of non-medical users,"" Holder said. As an example of the growing problem, the Justice Department says there was a 320% increase in heroin seized along the southwest U.S. border from 2008 through 2013. The attorney general is also asking that first responders be equipped with a overdose-reversing drug called Naloxone. Parts of New Jersey and New York State already use the drug, which is injected into patients suffering from heroin overdoses. How heroin kills you .

"(CNN) -- Is the English Premier League -- often dubbed the ""best football league in the world"" -- about to make its financial clout count in Europe's biggest club competition? Spain might have dominated last season's Champions League, with Real Madrid and Atletico contesting the final, but La Liga should brace itself for an English armada, according to a leading financial expert. According to the 23rd Annual Review of Football finance from sports business group Deloitte, Premier League clubs' revenue reached a record $4.19 billion in the 2012-13 season. And with the Premier League's $9.4 billion, three-year television deal -- $5.7 billion for domestic rights, the rest for overseas -- having started in 2013-14, English clubs could be set for a huge financial advantage over their continental rivals. ""The new TV deal puts those Premier League teams qualifying for the Champions League in a good position because they'll be generating a lot more revenue than their European opponents,"" Deloitte senior consultant Adam Bull told CNN. ""For Premier League clubs, the increase we've seen this year and one we'll definitely see next year because of the television deal, gives them a real opportunity to challenge even with the new UEFA Financial Fair Play regulations,"" added Bull, referring to the rules imposed by Europe's governing body to ensure clubs live within their means. Since 2000, Spanish clubs have won the Champions League six times, twice the number managed by English teams in that time. ""English teams will be generating more revenue than anyone else and while the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid can negotiate their television rights, the Premier League sides will be very competitive,"" Bull said. But it's not all good news for the 20 Premier League clubs -- over 75% of their revenue increase in 2012-13 was spent on wages. The report shows that total wages rose by 8% to £1.8 billion ($3 billion) and resulted in the overall Premier League clubs' wages-to-revenue ratio reaching a record high of 71%. The ratio was just 44% for the Premier League's first season in 1991-1992. So with revenue going into players' pockets almost as soon as it arrives at the banks of English top-flight teams, aggregate operating profit fell by £2 million to £82 million ($137 million) -- an operating margin of just 3% of revenue. However, 13 Premier League clubs made an operating profit in 2012-13 compared with just 10 in the previous year. ""The pattern in spending on wages following previous increases in broadcast deals, suggests it's likely around 60% or more of the revenue increase in 2013-14 will flow through to wages,"" added Bull. ""On that basis, we would expect Premier League total wage costs to reach a new record level of around £2.2 billion ($3.68 billion). ""However, given the forecast increase in revenue, this would also return the wages-to-revenue ratio below 70% for the first time since 2009-10."" While the total European football market grew to a record $28.65 billion in 2012-13, the Premier League led the way once again. According to Deloitte, a 21% growth in commercial income enabled Premier League club revenue to top $4.19 billion for the first time. The success of the Premier League means its rivals have been left behind with Germany ($2.85 billion), Spain ($2.68 billion), Italy ($2.34 billion) and France ($1.84 billion) trailing in its wake. ""Once again the global appeal of the Premier League has continued to drive commercial revenue growth, particularly at the highest ranked Premier League clubs,"" said Deloitte's Dan Jones. ""Matchday revenue also increased by 6% with fewer unsold seats at Premier League games than ever before."" And that lucrative television deal will only serve to swell the coffers of EPL clubs next season. ""We estimate that Premier League clubs' revenue will have increased by almost 30% to £3.2 billion ($5.4 billion) in 2013-14,"" Jones added. ""This growth will be driven by the revenue from the first season of the Premier League's new broadcast deals and further commercial revenue growth at the biggest clubs."" In total, Premier League revenue grew by $276 million, some 7%, with Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool responsible for 60% of the growth. ""Four of the big five leagues have maintained or reduced revenue-to-wages ratio and have shown a greater sense of cost control,"" said Bull. ""In Spain, the ratio is the lowest it has been since 2000 and is indicative of what we're beginning to see in Europe. ""It's different in the Premier League because of the upcoming television deal and so clubs are spending more as they know the money is coming in."" In 2012-13, the cumulative revenue of the ""big five"" European Leagues grew 5% to $13.3 million, representing half of the overall size of the European football market of $27.1 billion (up 2%). While the Premier League tops the revenue table, it comes second to the Bundesliga in terms of profitability. The 18-team German league, won by Bayern Munich, made operating profits of $379 million compared to the EPL's $137 million. Bayern and Borussia Dortmund combined represented over 80% of the league's $199 million revenue increase. The Bundesliga is the only top-five league where broadcast deals are not the largest source of revenue, with German clubs retaining the strictest cost control with a wages-to-revenue ratio of 51%. In Spain, commercial and matchday revenues both decreased during the 2012-13 season, while new television deals drove the league's $105 million (4%) revenue increase. In Italy, broadcast income continues to dominate, contributing $1.36 billion (59%) to the total of clubs' revenues. While the total league revenue was up 6% to $132 millon, the 20 Serie A teams also showed how they are cutting costs, recording operating loss reductions of $146 million. In France, Qatari-backed Paris Saint-Germain accounted for all of the league's revenue growth for the second successive year.","Over 75% of the Premier League clubs' revenue increase in 2012-13 was spent on wages .

"(CNN) -- A college degree can be an important gateway to employment, a career and a better standard of living. But a college degree does not equate to someone's level of intelligence or talent. For those seeking the best workers or leaders, there is a plethora of intelligent, inventive people without degrees who should not be overlooked. Recognizing this does not negate the importance of a college education -- the intellectual knowledge, access to a wide array of subjects and experience gained on a college campus can be transformative. Studies demonstrate clearly that without a college degree, you will likely earn less, be more liable to be unemployed and have fewer opportunities for career advancement. The challenge is that access to college has become more limited. At a time when degrees are so important to income potential, they are going increasingly to privileged and affluent young people. As the 2010 book ""Rewarding Strivers"" points out, among those who scored in the highest quartile of a national standardized test, those from affluent families were twice as likely to attend college as those from poorer families. So a lot of talent goes unrecognized and undeveloped. And those without college degrees aren't necessarily less driven or intelligent than those with degrees. Michael Ellsberg, author of ""The Education of Millionaires,"" argued in The New York Times recently that the skills of entrepreneurs are not learned ""crouched over a desk studying for multiple-choice exams."" Indeed, years ago Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance created a research-based entrepreneurship test that deducts a substantial number of points if you were a high achiever in school. This is what we have found at Public Allies over the past two decades. We have worked with thousands of young adults without college degrees and have seen many achieve incredible success (with many eventually completing degrees). We've seen a single mom in community college become a White House lawyer, a former gang member create a youth development organization and a woman raised in foster care work for a foundation reforming foster care systems. I share these and many other stories in my book, ""Everyone Leads."" When we equate talent, competence and character with credentials, we block a lot of superstar leaders our businesses, communities and country need. Here are examples of other superstars who did not complete college on their rise to the top: . -- We all know the story of Steve Jobs, who dropped out of Reed College. Since the days of Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, many business leaders got their starts without the benefit of degrees, including Larry Ellison of Oracle, Bill Gates and Paul Allen of Microsoft, Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz of Facebook, Michael Dell of Dell Computers, Brian Dunn of Best Buy, Anna Wintour of Vogue, Barry Diller of IAC, John Mackey of Whole Foods, David Geffen, Ralph Lauren and Ted Turner. -- David Plouffe, senior advisor to President Barack Obama and architect of his innovative and historically unprecedented campaign, dropped out of the University of Delaware to work in politics (returning to complete his degree in 2010). President George W. Bush's top adviser, Karl Rove, and John McCain's 2008 campaign manager, Steve Schmidt, also lacked degrees. -- Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, dropped out of Marquette University. He is joined by Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona, Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah, U.S. Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska and 33 members of the U.S. House of Representatives. -- Maya Angelou has received many honorary doctorates but never attended college to learn her craft. She's in good company with many other great American writers, such as Gore Vidal, August Wilson, Mark Twain, William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Robert Frost, Joseph Brodsky and Harper Lee. -- Woody Allen is loved by intellectuals for his philosophical films, but he did not gain his style on a campus, having flunked out of City College of New York. Other Oscar winners without degrees include Clint Eastwood, James Cameron, Robert Redford, Michael Moore, Sidney Pollack, George Clooney, Hillary Swank, Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Steven Spielberg (who completed a degree in 2002). -- Oprah Winfrey left Tennessee State University in 1976 to begin her career in media (completing her degree in 1986). Top talkers without degrees include Larry King, Ellen DeGeneres, Jimmy Kimmel, Joy Behar, Rosie O'Donnell and conservative talkers Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity. -- Brian Williams attended three schools and completed 18 undergraduate credits before working his way to NBC News anchor. Peter Jennings, Walter Cronkite and John Chancellor were also anchors without degrees. And many reporters and columnists never completed college, including Nina Totenberg of NPR, Carl Bernstein of The Washington Post and former New York Times columnist and wordsmith William Safire. -- Alicia Keys has made a name for herself as a singer, songwriter and political activist. She joins an exclusive club of singer/activists without degrees that includes Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Steve Earle and Jon Bon Jovi. The point of this list is not to disparage higher education -- it is still the best pathway to success. But imagine if venture capitalists had denied Steve Jobs or Bill Gates support because their resumes lacked a diploma, or if producers had denied Oprah Winfrey a television show because she had not completed her degree. We need to make college more accessible to smart people from all backgrounds, while also being careful not to judge talent, character or competence primarily by higher education credentials. Our nation should be a ladder of opportunity for the best talent, regardless of background. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Schmitz.","Paul Schmitz: A college degree does not equate to someone's level of intelligence or talent .

"(CNN) -- Jaelithe Judy has been taking her son with her when she votes ever since he was born. They've been talking about politics since he was 4. Now 7 years old, Isaac likes to say that he's going to become a science teacher -- and the president of the United States. Judy herself was raised by a politically motivated mom and accompanied her on Equal Rights Amendment marches when she was as young as 8. It inspired her to become a political blogger, both with MOMocrats and her own blog, The State of Discontent. Tackling heated discussions, educating yourself about issues and getting candid about candidates can be difficult, even for the politically inclined. But political mom bloggers have taken the challenge to a new level: combining the delicate art form of being a parent with being politically active, and including their children in the entire process. ""I think it's really important to raise children with a sense of public responsibility,"" Judy said. ""One of the values I want to instill in my son is this idea that as an American citizen, he's responsible for paying attention to what the government is doing so later, when he's old enough to vote, he's empowered to make rational decisions."" Isaac may not be running for president any time soon, but he's on the right track. Children inherently possess a sense of fairness, which makes them prime candidates for political understanding and conversations, Judy said. While reaching out on a smaller scale than other parenting-centric mom blogs, these politically motivated websites are a great way to connect like-minded mothers and share ideas. These blogs tend to become increasingly active around elections, Judy said. MOMocrats was one of only 55 national blogs to attend the Democratic National Convention. ""The blog had literally been started in 2007 by three moms talking over coffee in a cafe,"" Judy said. ""So we personally felt like recognition as legitimate press from the DNC was a pretty powerful sign that the trend of mothers blogging about politics was being taken seriously by the political establishment and the wider media."" In addition to political blogging, these moms try to incorporate politics into their home life. Molly Teichman's kids wouldn't be as interested in politics if their family weren't so actively involved. While she is holding a central committee meeting in the gym, her kids are playing basketball just a few feet away. ""When parents become involved and talk about it, you become a model for your kids, and then they understand that it's their responsibility to seek out news and information you can trust and make solid decisions on,"" said Teichman, a conservative who runs the Political Mommentary blog. She was also an official blogger for the Conservative Political Action Conference. Teichman's reasons for being so politically active run deep. Her grandmother once posed the question, ""Why do you keep having these children? Why would you want them to grow up in this world?"" Teichman knew that she had to do something to make a difference in the world her children were growing up in, and that route was politics. Blogging as a politically inclined mother has connected her with both like-minded and opposing party-affiliated women all across the country. While there may be tension between their differing views on issues, Teichman considers the political mom blogger movement to be a beautiful thing. ""When women start to collaborate, there's this warm, holistic nature,"" she said. ""We may be affiliated with different parties, but we come to a consensus and an understanding when the day is over. Both online and at conferences, I just see so much 'come together.'"" Her 10-year-old son, Jackson, is getting caught up in the spell of the election because while his dad has picked a favorite in the political season, Mommy has not. ""He likes to set himself up right between us and ask questions about how we make our decisions,"" Teichman said. ""He asks what we're looking for if we're watching one of the debates, he asks who's asking the question, why do they want to know, what's the reporter, what's their role?"" In fact, these mom bloggers say there has never been a more exciting or engaging time for kids to become interested in some facet of the election scene. ""As they talk about issues in school or they come up naturally in history or social studies classes, your kids come home and talk about that,"" said Joanne Bamberger, the mind behind the PunditMom blog. ""We're in an election season and that provides a good opportunity to have a conversation, if you want to."" While Bamberger and her husband align with progressive Democratic politics, they don't want to influence their daughter or her future decisions. This age range, ""between the elementary and tween years,"" can be a great time to have political discussions with kids, but it is also incredibly easy to sway their views. Bamberger takes the same kind of balanced approach that she sees in some of the families she interviewed for her book, ""Mothers of Intention."" She has witnessed a trend of families aiming to indoctrinate their kids with hyperpartisan politics, but doesn't agree with it. Instead, she suggests explaining all partisan beliefs and objectives, even if they don't align with your own. ""Our kids understand there is more than one side to every issue,"" she said. ""I tell them, we may believe this, but there are other people who think this other thing for varying reasons."" Shannon Drury, founder of The Radical Housewife blog, tries to keep her party affiliation as a separate entity from her children, although she actively talks about politics with them often. Politics actually bring her family together. ""As a political activist myself, I can't help but talk with my kids about why I take the stands I do,"" she said. ""After all, I share my values about everything else in my life -- I tell them why I recycle, why I drive the speed limit, why I eat my vegetables, and I tell them why I prefer Madonna to Ke$ha, so I might as well explain why I voted for Obama!"" Drury takes her kids with her to abortion rights rallies, candidate events, marches and even a few Occupy Wall Street-allied demonstrations in Minnesota and Wisconsin. She encourages them that while they aren't old enough to vote now, they can still be a part of the political process with her. Her children are becoming activists in their own right. ""The even greater reward of their childhood activism, though, will be growing into adults who are confident that they have the ability to participate in the political process, no matter where on the liberal/conservative spectrum they eventually fall,"" she said. ""Civic engagement is an important part of being a healthy, fully rounded person."" While some moms have the ability to be actively involved in their community or work directly in politics, not all mothers have that ability. Blogging about parenting and politics connects them to this sphere. They can talk about the two topics separately, or how to talk about political news with their kids. ""We don't talk to our neighbors as much as we used to, so the online community helps,"" Judy said. ""The Internet is a wonderful outlet, a great place for women to connect and share parenting experiences. This movement has the potential to create new common-ground alliances between women with very different backgrounds.""","Mom bloggers are tackling the challenges of parenting and being politically active .
No matter their party affiliation, these bloggers agree that the community aspect helps them .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has revealed UNESCO has accepted its application to include documentation of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre and the issue of so-called ""comfort women"" -- sex slaves used by Japanese soldiers during World War II -- into a program that preserves important historical material relating to world heritage. UNESCO says it has received China's application to list ""comfort women"" but that no decision will be made until 2015. The issue threatens to put further strain on Sino-Japanese relations, which have deteriorated in recent years over conflicting territorial claims in the region as well as Japan's wartime past. Earlier this year, Japan applied for a collection of diaries and wills of kamikaze pilots from World War II, to be registered with the same UNESCO body. The organization's Memory of the World program has been collecting important world documents since 1992, preserving precious and potentially threatened material. Its archives include the diary of Ann Frank and the 13th century Magna Carta -- a document that challenged the English monarchy's absolute rule, making it subject to the rule of law. Chinese state media, Xinhua news agency, reported Thursday that the latest UNESCO-registered documents are primary sources that point to atrocities committed by Japanese troops occupying the Chinese city of Nanjing from December 13, 1937 to March 1, 1938. This includes historical files recording the recruitment of ""comfort women"" related to the Japanese Kwantung Army, police stationed at the Shanghai International Settlement, the Japanese-supported puppet regime of Wang Jingwei, and the Central Bank of Manchou, as well as written confessions by Japanese troops, according to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA). Sex slavery . Japan forced about 200,000 women into sex slavery, luring them to ""comfort stations"" set up throughout East Asia by the Japanese military from 1932 until the end of the war, according to nonprofit advocacy group Washington Coalition for Comfort Women Issues. CNN has widely reported on the stories of the women. Many have said they were kidnapped. For resisting sex, some say, they were raped and beaten. China insists that Japan has not officially apologized for these wartime atrocities. The Nanjing Massacre refers to the invasion of the city of Nanjing in China's Jiangsu province in 1937, during which time Japanese troops killed an estimated 300,000 people in a rampage of rape, murder, and looting. Japanese conservatives insist that the mass murders and rapes did not take place. China submitted the wartime documents to the UNESCO program ""to prevent the miserable and dark days from coming back again,"" said MoFA spokeswoman Hua Chunying. 'Political move' Japan has condemned China's decision to register the wartime documents, calling it a political move during a sensitive period in the two countries' relations. ""It is extremely regrettable that China used UNESCO politically to unnecessarily play up the negative legacy on a certain period of the history of the both countries when we need effort for the improvement on the bilateral relationship,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Wednesday. Suga added: ""We cannot deny that there was murders and looting against non-combatants after the Japanese imperial army entered into Nanjing. However there are several estimates about the scale and it is difficult for the government to determine clearly.""","Japan tried to register kamikaze pilots' wills with UNESCO in February .

"(CNN) -- A military judge dismissed the jury Monday in Army Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair's court-martial after e-mails emerged over the weekend that could point to alleged Pentagon interference in the proceedings. Among the 22 pages of e-mails are a January communication in which a senior military lawyer writes Fort Bragg's chief of military justice casting doubt on SInclair's accuser's credibility, and a February correspondence in which a lieutenant colonel with the Judge Advocate General's Corps asked for a colonel's ""thoughts/opinion"" on Sinclair's offer to enter a plea. According to CNN affiliate WTVD, Col. James Pohl, the presiding judge in the court-martial, granted a motion to reconsider whether unlawful command influence has marred the proceedings. The judge ruled Army prosecutors failed to meet their burden of proof in denying that the court-martial had been unduly influenced. Now, according to WTVD, the court must determine whether to grant a mistrial or delay the current trial and start over. The judge ruled out his third option: dropping the most serious charges against Sinclair, said Josh Zeitz, a spokesman for the defense. Last week, Sinclair, formerly one of the top Army commanders in Afghanistan, pleaded guilty to several charges, including committing adultery, engaging in inappropriate relationships with three women, conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, and obstruction of justice, reported the public affairs office for Fort Bragg in North Carolina. The government's lawyers dropped two counts -- one of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, and the other for cruelty and maltreatment -- while Sinclair still stands accused of ""sodomy ... by force and without the consent"" of his alleged victim, an Army captain. Charges also loom for alleged cruel and maltreatment of subordinates and defrauding the government, according to Fort Bragg. The accuser, whom the defense has painted as a jilted lover upset that Sinclair wouldn't leave his wife, testified the day after Sinclair entered pleas to some charges, with the accuser telling the court that the affair started with intimate exchanges and evolved into groping and demands for sex and oral sex, WTVD reported. She was slated to continue testifying Monday, but the judge put the case on hold. It's unclear if she will resume testimony Tuesday. The e-mails that brought the proceedings to a halt Monday were described by defense attorney Richard Scheff as evidence showing that not only did senior Army officials believe that the accuser had a credibility issue, but also that commanders are making decision based on politics rather than justice. In the January communication, Col. Michael Lacey, a staff judge advocate, writes Lt. Gen. Joseph Anderson about the accuser's testimony regarding an iPhone she said she found December 9. ""The forensic analysis of the phone indicates she accessed the phone before 9 December, which brings her credibility into question. The Special Victims Prosecutor (SVP) is trying to reconcile the forensic analysis and her statement, but it is possible that she was not truthful,"" Lacey wrote. The defense wants the remaining charges against Sinclair dismissed and says the case ""should never have come to trial."" ""It's a mess entirely of the government's making,"" Scheff said. ""When the chief prosecutor quits because he doesn't believe the accuser, when senior officials in the chain of command and the Pentagon agree that the accuser has a credibility problem, and when commanders make decisions based on politics instead of justice, how can you possibly call this a functional process?""","Judge dismisses jury after 22 pages of e-mails emerge over weekend .

"(CNN) -- North Korea has made another move toward possibly restarting its suspended nuclear program, the U.N. nuclear agency reports. A South Korean looks at the demolition of a cooling tower at the North's Yongbyon nuclear complex, June 27, 2008. At the reclusive nation's request, the International Atomic Energy Agency has removed surveillance equipment and seals from the Yongbyon nuclear facility, agency spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said. The move clears the way for North Korea to reintroduce nuclear material to the facility. The North has told the IAEA that it will do that in a week or so. The U.N. nuclear watchdog will no longer have access at Yongbyon and will not be able to monitor any activities at the nuclear reprocessing facility. Mohamed ElBaradei, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Monday that agency inspectors had observed that ""some equipment previously removed by (North Korea) during the disablement process has been brought back."" ElBaradei said then that he was hopeful that conditions could be developed for North Korea ""to return to the Non-Proliferation Treaty at the earliest possible date and for the resumption by the agency of comprehensive safeguards."" Last week, a South Korean news agency reported that North Korea was restoring a reactor at Yongbyon nuclear complex and no longer wanted to be removed from a U.S. list of countries that sponsor terrorism. Hyun Hak-Bong, a chief North Korean negotiator at the six-nation talks aimed at halting the country's nuclear program, told reporters his country was ""thoroughly preparing to restart"" the reactor and that reporters would ""know soon"" when his country would do that, the Yonhap news agency said. But a senior U.S. diplomat has said the announcement could simply be a bargaining ploy in the long-running negotiations. The U.S. had seen no indications North Korea was actually rebuilding its reactor, the diplomat said. The U.S. envoy to North Korea addressed the fresh standoff with reporters Monday, saying the U.S. was still trying to strike a deal with Pyongyang to come clean on its nuclear claims. ""The six-party process has had its difficult moments and we are certainly experiencing one now,"" Assistant Secretary of State Chris Hill told reporters. Although North Korea has threatened to restart its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, ""We don't expect any dramatic developments in the next few days,"" he said. Hill said U.S. officials had the impression North Korea wanted to reach agreement with Bush administration before it left office. Earlier, a senior State Department official told CNN that in recent weeks the North Koreans had taken a ""harder-line stance toward the six-party talks."" U.S. intelligence officials told CNN last week that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has been suffering serious health problems, and may have had a stroke. North Korea had agreed to disable the Yongbyon nuclear complex by October in exchange for a pledge from the U.S. to lift some sanctions and remove North Korea from a list of countries that sponsor terrorism.","IAEA: N.

"New York (CNN) -- New York police have detained a 20-year-old woman they say left a baby in a stroller on a subway platform Monday. A witness told police she saw a woman, described as between 20 and 30 years old, push a stroller from a subway car onto the platform when the doors opened. The woman didn't get off the train, instead letting the doors slide closed and continuing on, according to the witness. After waiting 20 minutes with the baby on the platform to see if the caretaker or mother would return for the child, the witness alerted police. The 7-month-old girl is in stable condition at nearby St. Luke's Hospital. She was not malnourished, though she suffers from a bit of eczema, police said. Early Tuesday morning, police announced they had detained a woman for questioning. They didn't release her name but said she was the baby's mother.

"London, England (CNN) -- A 53-day journey by train might sound like murder on the Orient Express, but one enterprising British travel company is offering rail tickets that take nearly eight weeks to circumnavigate the globe. As you'd expect for the $36,500 price tag, you won't be spending six weeks cooped in the cheap seats listening to other people yammering into their cell phones. The ticket offered by Great Rail Journeys is first class most of the way, crossing three continents in the kind of style you'd associate with a golden age of rail travel -- albeit without the top hats and tailcoats. En route, passengers get to experience some of the world's most luxurious trains, including the Tsar's Gold Private Train from Mongolia, the Venice Simplon Orient-Express and the British Orient Express Pullman. The itinerary begins in London on May 18, 2015. ""We've got some pretty long journeys in our portfolio, but we've never done the full circumnavigation,"" Julian Appleyard of Great Rail Journeys said. Passengers will fly to New York and then spend 20 days crossing North America by train. They call in at Washington, Chicago and Denver and then sample a few classic rail rides such as Colorado's scenic Royal Gorge route and the steam-powered Durango & Silverton line. Ten epic train journeys . There's a side trip to the Grand Canyon, a sojourn in Los Angeles and a boat ride to San Francisco, where passengers take to the air once again to reach Shanghai. The trip sticks firmly to the rails from then on, taking passengers from Xian, home of terra cotta warriors, to Beijing and then on to Russia via Mongolia. The journey links up with the epic Trans-Siberian line to reach Moscow before pressing on into Europe. After calling at Warsaw, Prague, Vienna, Innsbruck and Venice, it heads back to London. Appleyard says the company had sold its first tickets but is planning to limit numbers to about 25 to ""keep it fairly exclusive."" ""There is a huge number of people who are interested in rail as a method of travel,"" he said. ""This is quite clearly the longest and most expensive trip we've ever done so it's going to appeal to the wealthy and, at 53 days, people with time on their hands."" If 53 days sounds a little on the slow side, another company offers a similar journey in reverse, via Canada, that takes a mere 40 days.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- ""Blade Runner"" Oscar Pistorius broke down and vomited in court Monday as he heard a pathologist testify about his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp's injuries after he shot her dead on Valentine's Day last year. The testimony of pathologist Gert Saayman was interrupted by Pistorius' sobbing and retching, leading to a pause in the proceedings. Earlier, Judge Thokozile Masipa imposed a broadcast blackout on Saayman's testimony. Masipa, who has been presiding over the weeklong trial in Pretoria, extended the ban to live reporting on Twitter. Pistorius admits he shot Steenkamp, 29, but says that it was a tragic case of mistaken identity and that he thought she was an intruder who had broken into his home. In court, Saayman confirmed that Steenkamp died from multiple gunshot wounds, consistent with having been hit in the head, arm and hip by three shots fired through the locked door of a toilet cubicle. Pistorius appeared deeply physically distressed throughout the testimony, repeatedly making retching sounds and clutching his head in his hands. The track star, 27, appeared at times to try to cover his ears by clasping his hands behind his neck, or he put his fingers in his ears. His brother and sister came to check on him during the brief break in Saayman's testimony. Security guard on the stand . Saayman said any of the three injuries to Steenkamp could have been fatal and all immediately incapacitating. He said it was probably the bullet to the skull that killed her almost immediately. It passed from the top of her head over her right eye to the base of her skull, suggesting that she was not standing when hit, he added. Saayman said the wounds were consistent with ""ranger"" bullets, which open up ""like the petals of a flower"" to cause maximum tissue damage. Earlier on Monday, defense lawyers challenged a security guard's statements about what happened on the night. Guard Pieter Baba said he talked by phone to Pistorius the night of the killing and Pistorius said ""everything's fine"" or ""everything's OK."" But defense lawyer Barry Roux said Pistorius had said, ""I'm fine."" Baba was adamant, saying, ""What I just told the court is the truth."" Baba's testimony proceeded slowly because all questions and answers had to go through a translator. He gave two statements to police, months apart. On Friday, Baba said he could hear Pistorius was crying and he knew everything was not fine. Read more: First week of the trial -- three bangs, four shots, nine witnesses . Baba arrived at the house in time to witness Pistorius coming down the stairs carrying Steenkamp. ""I was so shocked, I couldn't think for a few moments,"" he testified. Pistorius has pleaded not guilty to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with Steenkamp's killing as well as two gun indictments unrelated to her death. Follow the trial live . Gun at his bedside . Another witness who testified Friday, former Pistorius girlfriend Samantha Taylor, said their relationship ended when he cheated on her with Steenkamp. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel asked Taylor if she was ever at Pistorius' house when he thought there was an intruder. Taylor said yes. She said Pistorius once heard something hit a bathroom window and woke her up to ask if she'd heard it, too, before taking his gun and going to investigate. Taylor said Pistorius woke her up other times when he thought he'd heard a noise. Taylor also testified that Pistorius slept with a pistol on his bedside table or on the floor beside his prosthetic legs and once became so angry after a traffic stop that he shot a gun through the sunroof of a car. Taylor said she met Pistorius in 2010, when she was 17, and they started dating the following year. She said they broke up twice, the second time on November 4, 2012, after he took Steenkamp to a sports banquet. Roux asked if Taylor admitted in two e-mails to cheating on Pistorius. Taylor says she's never admitted to cheating on him but admits she had a relationship with another man after they broke up the first time. Roux asked Taylor for details about the time he supposedly shot the gun out of the sunroof, but Taylor could not remember the name of the highway or the location in South Africa. She testified that Pistorius was angry and irritated after the traffic stop, even though he was not driving. She said he joked around about firing a shot and then laughed after he fired. Finding inconsistencies . Nel put four neighbors of Pistorius on the stand in the first week of the trial, all of whom described hearing screaming and loud bangs they thought were gunshots the night of the killing. Roux then tried to find inconsistencies or uncertainty in their stories. The defense goal is to prove there is a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused. One of the most dramatic witnesses was a neighbor, Johan Stipp, who rushed to the track star's home the night he shot Steenkamp. Pistorius broke down in court as Stipp said he saw Steenkamp lying on the floor, her brain tissue mixed with blood and Pistorius praying for her to live. ""I remember the first thing he said when I got there was, 'I shot her, I thought she was a burglar and I shot her,' "" Stipp told the court in Pretoria. Although Stipp is a prosecution witness, his testimony may bolster the defense case, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said after Thursday's gripping testimony. Prosecutors appear to have been trying to demonstrate that Pistorius and Steenkamp had a loud argument before the shooting, suggesting it's the reason he killed her. But the defense is proposing that what neighbors thought was Steenkamp screaming in fear for her life was in fact Pistorius when he realized what he had done. Pistorius and at least two neighbors made phone calls to security after the shooting, allowing the defense to use phone records to establish a timeline of events. Stipp's version of events appears to coincide with the defense case, said Phelps, who teaches law at the University of Cape Town. Trial may last three weeks . Judge Masipa will decide whether Pistorius is innocent or guilty. South Africa does not have jury trials. In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence, with a minimum of 25 years. Pistorius also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for the firearms charge. If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide, a crime based on negligence, and could be looking at up to 15 years on that charge, experts said. The trial is expected to take at least three weeks. Pistorius and Steenkamp were a young, attractive, high-profile couple popular in South Africa's social circles. Pistorius, whose ""Blade Runner"" nickname reflects the special prostheses he uses while running, won six Paralympic gold medals and became the first double-amputee runner to compete in the Olympics, in London in 2012. Steenkamp, a model who was soon to star in a TV reality show, was on the cusp of becoming a celebrity in her own right at the time of her death.

"(CNN) -- The Texas actress who admitted sending ricin-laced letters to President Barack Obama and then-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was sentenced to 18 years in prison Wednesday, the U.S. attorney's office said. Shannon Guess Richardson, 36, also was ordered to pay $367,000 in restitution. ""Today's sentencing brings an appropriate and just end to what is surely one of our most unusual, even bizarre cases,"" John Bales, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas, said in a statement. In December, the actress pleaded guilty to possession of a toxin for use as a weapon, prosecutors said. Though the charge carried a maximum penalty of life in prison, prosecutors said at the time that Richardson entered into a plea deal under which she would not serve more than 18 years. Three envelopes containing the natural, highly toxic compound derived from castor beans were mailed from Shreveport, Louisiana, in May 2013, after records showed Richardson made online purchases of castor beans and lye, another component of ricin. Richardson lived in New Boston, Texas, about 90 miles north of Shreveport. In addition to Obama and Bloomberg, Richardson also mailed a poison letter to Mark Glaze, then-director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which Bloomberg founded, an FBI arrest affidavit said. The group's office is in Washington. The letters, which contained what the FBI described as ""very low concentrations"" of ricin, were discovered before causing any injuries or fatalities. They also issued a threat: ""You will have to kill me and my family before you get my guns. The right to bear arms is my constitutional God-given right. What's in this letter is nothing compared to what I've got planned for you."" What is ricin? Richardson -- who had minor roles in television shows, including ""The Walking Dead"" and ""The Vampire Diaries"" -- initially told FBI agents that her now-estranged husband had sent the tainted letters. But authorities said Richardson was found to be ""deceptive"" in a polygraph exam. Investigators found that her computer storage devices contained the text of threatening letters to Obama and the couple's computer records showed that her husband couldn't have printed them because he was at work at the time, according to an FBI arrest affidavit. Eventually, Richardson admitted to investigators that she'd mailed the letters, though she claimed her husband had typed them out and forced her to print and mail them, the affidavit said. Nathaniel Richardson denied any wrongdoing, telling investigators that his wife was ""intentionally misleading"" them and that she wanted to end their marriage, court papers said. He filed for divorce in June 2013, and court papers indicated that Shannon Richardson was pregnant. According to CNN affiliate KYTX-TV, Shannon Richardson gave birth to a boy, Brody, in July 2013, four months before her due date.

"(CNN) -- How difficult is it to board a plane with a stolen passport? Not as hard as you might think. In any major international airport, it's not uncommon to have your passport checked four times or more between check-in and boarding the aircraft. But if passenger documents aren't checked against Interpol's database of stolen and lost travel documents, travelers using those documents can slip through layers of security. Reports that two passengers on missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 were traveling on stolen Austrian and Italian passports have highlighted security concerns that have troubled Interpol for years, the international law enforcement agency said Sunday. The flight, carrying more than 200 passengers, disappeared from radar Saturday and hasn't been seen or heard from since. Interpol identified the men using the stolen passports as Pouri Nourmohammadi, 18, and Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza, 29, both Iranians. Malaysian police believe Nourmohammadi was trying to emigrate to Germany using the stolen Austrian passport. The men entered Malaysia on February 28 using valid Iranian passports, Interpol said. ""Interpol is asking why only a handful of countries worldwide are taking care to make sure that persons possessing stolen passports are not boarding international flights,"" Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said in a statement. Before the departure of Flight 370, no country had checked the stolen passports against Interpol's list since they were added to the lost-documents database in 2012 and 2013, Interpol said. Countries, but not airlines, have access to Interpol's data, and many governments don't routinely check passports against the database. In 2013, passengers were able to board planes more than 1 billion times without having their travel documents checked against Interpol's data, the agency said. Airlines carried more than 3.1 billion passengers globally in 2013, according to estimates from the International Air Transport Association. Are stolen passports related to plane's disappearance? Interpol head Noble said Tuesday that the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 does not appear to be related to terrorism. ""The more information we get, the more we're inclined to conclude that it was not a terrorist incident,"" Noble said at a news conference in Lyon, France. There's no evidence to suggest either of the men traveling on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight was connected to any terrorist organizations, according to Malaysian investigators. On any given day, many people travel using stolen or fake passports for reasons that have nothing to do with terrorism, aviation security expert Richard Bloom told CNN. They might be trying to immigrate illegally to another country, or they might be smuggling stolen goods, people, drugs or weapons or trying to import otherwise legal goods without paying taxes, said Bloom, director of terrorism, intelligence and security studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. ""For all of those reasons, the very notion that passports might be important in this particular situation may be a red herring,"" Bloom said. Noble said Sunday that the fact that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in Interpol's databases is a big concern. ""This is a situation we had hoped never to see,"" he said. ""For years Interpol has asked why should countries wait for a tragedy to put prudent security measures in place at borders and boarding gates?"" Few countries look up stolen passports . Interpol does not charge countries for access to its databases, but some of the 190 Interpol member countries may not have the technical capacity or resources to access the network, according to Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director. ""It's just up to the will of the country to set it up and do it,"" Fuentes said. Interpol's Stolen and Lost Travel Documents database was created in 2002, following the September 11, 2001, attacks, to help countries secure their borders. Since then, it has expanded from a few thousand passports and searches to more than 40 million entries and more than 800 million searches per year. About 60,000 of those 800 million searches yield hits against stolen or lost documents, according to Interpol. The United States searches the database more than 250 million times annually, the United Kingdom more than 120 million times annually and the United Arab Emirates more than 50 million times annually, Interpol said. (Some 300,000 passports are lost or stolen each year in the United States, according to the U.S. State Department, which collects reports of stolen passports and sends them to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Interpol.) According to the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection vets all travelers booked on flights to, from and heading through the United States through the Advanced Passenger Information System. It conducts a thorough review of all relevant domestic and international criminal databases, including Interpol's, for any issues of concern. This review includes reports of stolen documents. ""If Malaysia Airlines and all airlines worldwide were able to check the passport details of prospective passengers against Interpol's database, then we would not have to speculate whether stolen passports were used by terrorists to board MH 370,"" Interpol's Noble said. The Thailand connection . The Austrian and Italian passports were stolen in Thailand in 2012 and 2013, respectively, according to Interpol. Thailand is a booming market for stolen passports. Paul Quaglia, who has been working in the region as a security and risk analyst for 14 years, said the situation in Thailand is better than it was five to 10 years ago ""but still not up to international standards."" ""Unfortunately, Thailand remains a robust venue for the sale of high-quality false passports (which includes altered stolen passports) and other supporting documentation,"" he said. Not all ""lost"" passports are necessarily ""stolen"" passports, Quaglia said. ""Some passports 'lost' are actually sold by the passport holder. Some young men and others traveling to Thailand, short on cash after extended partying and high living, can be approached to sell a passport, which can be easily replaced at embassies upon presentation of a routine 'lost passport' police report,"" he said. Searching for true identities . An investigation was launched into the Flight 370 matter, with Malaysian and aviation authorities reviewing video and other documentation to try to identify not only who the passengers were that used the stolen passports but how the illegal passports cleared security. In an interview with CNN on Monday, Thailand Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said the country is cooperating with Interpol in the investigation. Interpol's Noble urged countries and airlines to adopt routine checks against its lost and stolen document database. ""I sincerely hope that governments and airlines worldwide will learn from the tragedy of missing flight MH 370 and begin to screen all passengers' passports prior to allowing them to board flights,"" Noble said. ""Doing so will indeed take us a step closer to ensuring safer travel.""","Two passengers on the missing Malaysian Airlines flight were traveling on stolen passports .

"(CNN) -- Famed boxer Hector Camacho died after he was taken off life support early Saturday, a hospital spokeswoman in Puerto Rico told CNN. A passing gunman on Tuesday shot Camacho, who was in a car in front of a bar in his hometown of Bayamon, Puerto Rico. He was declared clinically brain dead on Thursday and placed on life support. Camacho, 50, suffered a heart attack and had been taken off life support, said Wilmelis Marquez, spokeswoman for the Rio Piedras Medical Center. He was pronounced dead at 1:45 a.m., she said. She said his organs were not healthy enough to be donated. Camacho, a former lightweight and junior lightweight champion, was in the passenger seat of the car, police said. The driver was shot twice and killed, they said. The suspects are two men believed to have been traveling in a gray vehicle, said Lt. Wilfredo Rivera of CataÃ±o Police. They escaped after a shootout with police at a residential complex, WAPA TV reported. Investigators continued to search Saturday for the two suspects, said Alex Diaz, spokesman for the Puerto Rico Police Department in the Bayamon division. Authorities found nine bags of cocaine on the slain driver, who had a long history of drug-related charges and was Camacho's friend, Diaz said. Police also found one opened bag of cocaine inside the car, Diaz said. Camacho was considered a promoter's godsend because he was a showman in the ring against some of the greatest fighters of his era: Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran, Oscar de la Hoya, Julio Cesar Chavez, Felix Trinidad and Vinny Pazienzia. He was known for long, flashy trunks with tassels, and he enjoyed being theatrical, as evidenced by his ""Macho"" nickname. His flamboyance was as dazzling as his hand-and-foot speed, and his titles and victories attested to his talent. A southpaw, he won world titles in the classes of super lightweight, lightweight and junior welterweight in the 1980s. He amassed a record of 79 victories, six losses and three draws. Among his high-profile bouts was his 1997 knockout of Leonard, ending his comeback effort. But the same year, Camacho lost to de la Hoya. His most recent fight was in 2010, when he was well past his prime and his life was being marked by drug, alcohol and marital problems. He lost that bout to Saul Duran. Camacho was born in Bayamon and was raised in New York after his family moved to Spanish Harlem. In 2005, he was arrested in Mississippi on charges of trying to rob an electronics store and possession of the drug ecstasy. He was later given probation. This year, Camacho was ordered by a Florida court not to have contact with his ex-wife 13-year-old son after allegations that Camacho had attacked the boy.

"(CNN) -- A man who killed his daughter, six grandchildren and then himself in a shooting in north-central Florida was a convicted felon and wasn't allowed to possess the gun he used, police said Friday. Don Spirit, 51, killed his daughter, Sarah Spirit, 28, and her three sons and three daughters -- ages 3 months to 11 years -- at his home in Bell on Thursday afternoon before killing himself, Gilchrist County sheriff's officials said. Investigators didn't yet know any motive for the murder-suicide, Sheriff Robert Schultz said Friday. The massacre came more than a decade after, according to media reports, Don Spirit was convicted of a felony in the fatal shooting of his son in a hunting accident. The shootings occurred only about an hour after some of the children returned home from Bell Elementary School, school district Superintendent Rob Rankin told reporters Friday. Four of Sarah Spirit's children -- in grades K, 2, 3 and 5 -- attended the school of about 540 children. Students struggled with news of their classmates' deaths on Friday, Rankin said. ""It really hurt me this morning to be on our campus and seeing kids feeling the way they did this morning,"" Rankin said. "" ... It's devastating to our schools, but we're going to be strong through this."" A prayer vigil has been scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Sunday at the school, the sheriff's office webpage said. Thursday's killings . Schultz said a deputy went to the home after Don Spirit called 911 around 4 p.m. After the deputy arrived, Spirit killed himself. The deputy found the bodies of Sarah Spirit and the children inside the home. Police said they believe Spirit shot more than one person in the home, but declined to say whether all of the victims had been shot. Deputies had previously responded to calls from the home on numerous occasions, officials said. Spirit had a criminal history, Schultz said Thursday, without elaborating. Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Jeff Manning said Friday that he didn't believe any of the calls were related to domestic violence. The sheriff said the news would devastate the county, which has about 17,000 residents. ""We're all family here,"" he said. Florida community reels after mom kills son, daughter, self . Criminal record . Don Spirit, as a convicted felon, was not allowed to have a gun, Manning said Friday. The sheriff's office hasn't said how Spirit obtained a gun or what kind of firearm he used. In 2003, the Orlando Sentinel reported that Spirit was sentenced to three years in prison after he accidentally killed his son Kyle in a hunting accident two years prior. Spirit was charged in Osecola County with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and pleaded guilty, the newspaper reported at the time. That charge is a second-degree felony. Florida criminal records show Spirit was released from prison in February 2006. Court records show Spirit also was convicted in 1996 of possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana, a third-degree felony. Schultz declined to identify the father of the children, or whether all of the children had the same father. He said no one in the house survived Spirit's rampage. Bell is about 30 miles west of Gainesville. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","Mother, her six children shot and killed inside residence in Bell, Florida .

"(CNN) -- A varsity football player from suburban New York high school died after colliding with an opponent during a game, a school official said. Tom Cutinella, a 16-year-old student at Shoreham-Wading River High School, suffered a serious head injury during Wednesday night's game against Elwood-John H. Glenn High School, according to Suffolk County Police spokeswoman Joan Jesinger. Cutinella was transported to Long Island's Huntington Hospital, where he died later, Jesinger said. He was the third high school football player to die in the last week, according to published reports. Jesinger said police were investigating Cutinella's death. ""It was the result of a typical football play,"" Superintendent Steven Cohen told reporters Thursday. ""It was just a freak accident."" Cutinella stood up after the collision and then collapsed, Cohen said. The player had been blocking for a teammate, Newsday reported. ""Right now, our focus is really on the suffering that Tom's family and this community is going through,"" Cohen said, adding that the issue of a possible concussion was a matter for later discussion. Cohen said Cutinella was ""beloved by everyone who knew him"" and his death ""touched everyone in this community very deeply."" Cutinella excelled academically, had a great sense of humor and was a member of a peer-to-peer assistance program, Cohen said .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Prosecutors trying to prove that Oscar Pistorius murdered his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp appeared to have won a round on Tuesday morning, but it was the defense team that was smiling by the end of the day. Tuesday's testimony began with the expert who conducted the autopsy on Steenkamp, Gert Saayman. He backed two key points of the state's case. He estimated that Steenkamp had eaten about two hours before she died, which contradicts Pistorius' version of events, and he said that the victim would have been able to scream after the first two bullets hit her, as the prosecution argues. ""I think it would be somewhat abnormal if one did not scream when sustaining a wound of this nature,"" Saayman testified of the ""particularly devastating"" injury to Steenkamp's right arm. A day earlier he described in graphic detail the damage that Pistorius' bullets did to Steenkamp's body, leaving the defendant vomiting, dry heaving, weeping and clutching his head in his hands. Pistorius, 27, was calm in court on Tuesday. He pleaded not guilty to murder, although he admits killing his 29-year-old girlfriend by shooting her through a locked bathroom door. He mistook her for a burglar in his house in the middle of the night, he maintains, saying he made a tragic but understandable mistake. The prosecution is trying to build a circumstantial case that Pistorius is trigger-happy and that the couple argued before he killed her. Pistorius is also charged in connection with two other alleged incidents of guns going off in his hands, unrelated to the killing of Steenkamp. Pistorius' friend Darren Fresco, who was present for both incidents, was on the stand for the state most of the day on Tuesday. A furious Pistorius fired a gun from a car sunroof after a police officer handled his weapon during a traffic stop, Fresco testified. Fresco was driving the car in late 2012 when police pulled him over for speeding. ""(The) officer had picked up the accused's weapon, to which the accused said 'You can't just touch another man's gun,'"" Fresco said. ""He was furious about it, that someone else had touched his gun,"" Fresco said. Pistorius later that day fired through the sunroof ""out of the blue ... no warning,"" he said. On Friday, Pistorius' ex-girlfriend Samantha Taylor testified about the sunroof shooting incident, saying the two men laughed and joked about shooting a ""robot,"" a traffic light, before the gunfire. Fresco denied he had been joking with Pistorius before the gun went off. Restaurant gunshot . Fresco also testified about an incident at Tashas Restaurant, where Pistorius is accused of asking him to take the blame after he discharged Fresco's pistol under the table one month before Steenkamp's death. Fresco told defense lawyer Barry Roux that his written witness statement was prepared with a lawyer's help ""to make sure I wasn't going to put myself into any kind of trouble,"" but he insisted it was the truth. Judge Thokozile Masipa told Fresco he would be immune from prosecution for self-incriminating testimony if he tells the truth. At times Tuesday Fresco seemed evasive, insisting he did not remember what happened after dinner on the night of the sunroof incident, despite having described the day in detail up to that point. At other times he got testy with the acerbic Roux's cross-examination, saying he did not have a ruler with him when Roux asked how close he and Pistorius were when the gun changed hands at Tashas. And there were sharp intakes of breath in court toward the end of the day when Fresco let slip that he had been following some of the trial on Twitter. Fresco had volunteered on the stand that he was not wearing ""tracksuit bottoms"" at Tashas because it was summer. Roux pounced, asking who had said anything about tracksuit bottoms. ""People have said to me, 'Your name's been mentioned; your name's been mentioned; your name's been mentioned,"" Fresco said. ""I wanted to find out what was said."" Witnesses are not supposed to listen to the testimony of other witnesses in order to keep their testimony from being tainted. Gun at his bedside . The case against Pistorius is largely circumstantial, prosecutor Gerrie Nel conceded in his opening statement last week. Pistorius and Steenkamp were the only people in his house when he killed her in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013. Nel has been building a picture of what happened through the testimony of neighbors who heard screaming and bangs that night, current and former friends of the South African track star, and a security guard who sped to the scene because of reports of gunshots. Defense lawyer Roux has gone after holes, doubts, discrepancies and inconsistencies in prosecution witness stories. He is trying to sow reasonable doubt that their memories of events are correct. Many prosecution witnesses' stories are consistent with Pistorius' version of events, that he got up in the night, went out to his balcony to get a fan, came back inside, and heard noises in the bathroom that he thought to be an intruder. He said he took the gun and fired while calling for Steenkamp to call the police. When she didn't answer he realized it could have been her in the bathroom, he said. Taylor, his former girlfriend, testified Friday that he reacted similarly once when she was sleeping at his house. She said Pistorius, the first double-amputee to run in the Olympic Games, once heard something hit a bathroom window and woke her up to ask if she'd heard it, too, before taking his gun and going to investigate. Taylor said Pistorius woke her up other times when he thought he'd heard a noise. Taylor also testified that Pistorius slept with a pistol on his bedside table or on the floor beside his prosthetic legs, and he once became so angry after a traffic stop that he shot a gun through the sunroof of a car. Prosecutors appear to have been trying to demonstrate that Pistorius and Steenkamp had a loud argument before the shooting, suggesting it's the reason he killed her. Neighbors said they heard a woman screaming before the shots were fired. But the defense is proposing that what neighbors thought was Steenkamp screaming in fear for her life was in fact Pistorius when he realized what he had done. Pistorius and at least two neighbors made phone calls to security after the shooting, allowing the defense to use phone records to establish a timeline of events. Masipa will decide Pistorius' verdict. South Africa does not have jury trials. In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years. Pistorius also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for a firearms charge he also faces. If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide, a crime based on negligence. The sentence for culpable homicide is at the judge's discretion. The trial is expected to take at least three weeks. INTERACTIVE: Oscar Pistorius on trial: Explore each side's case .

"(CNN) -- All eyes will be on the figure skating rink (and the judges panel), it's Round 2 for Canada and the United States in this women's hockey tournament and women's halfpipe ski makes its debut without one of its pioneers. Figure skating . With expectations nearly as high as the men's hockey team, two Russian figure skaters are in position to medal Thursday. But instead of Julia Lipnitskaya being the Russian in the top 3 after the short program, it was Adelina Sotnikova who was just behind Yuna Kim, the current queen of the ice. A few U.S. journalists thought Sotnikova was the recipient of some generous scores from the judges, but she said she deserved the 74.64 total. ""I'm very happy the first (technical element score of 39.09) mark was so high,"" she said. ""I skated really well, and I got good levels on everything so I think they reflected my skate."" Lipnitskaya fell on a triple flip but still sits in fifth position between Americans Gracie Gold and Ashley Wagner. ""I don't know what happened. My preparation was all fine. I wasn't nervous. I didn't feel too much pressure,"" she said despite the immense hopes of her countrymen. ""The marks weren't as low as I expected. I can still fight for a medal tomorrow."" Yuna Kim still looks the part of champion despite her absence from many recent competitions. She'll be the final skater of the free skate, which she said will bring ""extra pressure."" Sotnikova, meanwhile, is the third skater of the final group. Third-place Carolina Kostner of Italy is just before the Russian. Kim, who is trying to join Sonja Henie and Katarina Witt as the only back-to-back female gold medalists in the sport, claims she is not about being a part of history. ""Personally, It's not my ambition to defend my gold medal. It's meaningful, but not significant,"" she said. ""I did well today but nobody knows what will happen tomorrow."" Other notable fact: Only four times has a female skater won the gold on her home ice. This will be the 24th version of the event. Women's ice hockey . It's been a long wait. For some, since Vancouver. For others, since they were children. After winning the first hockey tournament in 1998, the U.S. women have had to look up to the top of the Olympic podium to see another team get the gold medal. It's been Canada every dang time. In 2010, the Americans lost 2-0 in the final. About half of those U.S. players are back. ""There are 11 of us who have been training since Vancouver who came up short,"" Monique Lamoureux said. ""It's something that's motivated us for the last four years. It's something that really sticks with us."" Three Canadian players have won three gold medals, including Hayley Wickenheiser, perhaps the greatest women's player of all-time. ""It's where we wanted to be,"" Wickenheiser, 35, told Canada.com on Monday. ""We're ready for this, and we had a great run-up to this game (a semifinal win over pesky Switzerland). But we know we're going to have to bring our best game (against the States)."" Canada hasn't lost an Olympic game since February 17, 1998. For the United States the Games have brought bronze, silver, then another silver at Vancouver. U.S. players still sting from that loss, but winning gold has been a long-time goal. ""It's not just about Vancouver,"" Meghan Duggan said. ""Some of us have dreamed of this since we were little kids."" Canada won 3-2 when the two teams met in group play. The two teams meet again at noon ET. Women's curling . The Olympic world officially was introduced to curling in 1998. That year, a magnificent skip from Canada led her team to a gold medal. She was Sandra Schmirler -- Schmirler the Curler -- and for some of us, the first great curler we ever watched. And just two years later, she died of cancer, leaving us feeling robbed. Canada hasn't won women's curling since Nagano, but that might change Thursday when the undefeated Canadians face Sweden -- a team they beat 9-3 nine days ago -- in the final. ""All I can ask is that we put it all on the ice, and we have a shot at the win,"" Canada skip Jennifer Jones said after beating Great Britain in the semifinal. Sweden has won the past two gold medals but has a different skip this time. Margaretha Sigfridsson has yet to win any big tournaments and has four second-place results from the world championships. Women's halfpipe ski . If it's a new discipline with a history rooted at the X Games then the United States will have strong medal contenders, right? In this case, it's Maddie Bowman, Brita Sigourney, Angeli Vanlaanen and Annalisa Drew. Roz Groenewoud of Canada, who is dedicating her Games to the late Sarah Burke (a Canadian pipe star who died in 2012 during training), has responded well to knee surgeries. She placed second at a recent X games event won by Bowman. According to USA Today, Burke's husband and her parents made the trip to Sochi to see the Olympic premiere of the event Sarah Burke campaigned so much for. Groenewoud carries a piece of Burke's jewelry with her. ""She was extremely competitive, extremely driven, but that never colored her ability to be compassionate and generous with compliments and stuff like that,"" Groenewoud told USA Today of the four-time Winter X Games champion. Who else to watch: Marie Martinod of France came out of retirement and earlier this year finished third at the X Games. Men's ski cross . Ok, let's try to predict a sport in which six different people won seven World Cup races. One in which some ""favorite"" is going to be knocked out in an elimination race by another competitor. Usually we tell you about the defending champion, but Michael Schmid of Switzerland has raced just six World Cup events since 2010 due to a bad knee. So we'll be watching Jean-Frederic Chapuis of France who, besides the really cool name, has a world title. John Teller of the United States owns one of those World Cup wins. And according to his website, he works in the family garage when he is not skiing. Now there's somebody America can get behind. Who else to watch: It seems like any of the 32 racers in the eight heats has a podium chance.","Home ice has not always been kind to female figure skaters .

"(CNN) -- The Malaysia Airlines mystery remains unresolved. While it is too early to speculate about the cause of the airliner's disappearance, it is not a surprise that at least two people were able to board Malaysia Flight 370 with stolen passports. The fact is the world is far from having a foolproof system for checking travelers who move across borders. More than 50% of transborder passenger movements take place at airports, but how passengers are treated in security lines at the world's 600-plus major international airports is very much dependent on local regulations and practices. Various international organizations have proposed so-called ""smart"" solutions, such as biometric passports and electronic visas, but many forms of documentation used every day by millions of airline passengers are not digitized and are not being checked against any international databases. Moreover, without biometric protection, it is always possible to tamper with conventional passports, including the passport holder's photograph, something that might have happened here. Of course, there are some important exceptions where tighter controls prevail. In the European Union, the nations that belong to the ""Schengen"" agreement, which abolished internal borders among 27 European countries, use a shared security database for travelers moving within the Schengen-area member states. The United States, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates are the biggest users of the Interpol database for lost or stolen travel documents. Importantly, too, the United States requires airlines entering and leaving U.S. territory to submit travel document information about all passengers. Nevertheless, it remains true, even in a world that values security, that nations continue to have their own ideas about how to monitor travelers, how security information should be shared and to what extent identity information should be the subject of strong privacy protection. Most of the 190 nations that belong to Interpol, for example, simply do not bother to use the database even though they have access to it. As to privacy, even the United States and EU have different approaches, with the EU treating personal identity information as part of human and civil rights, while the U.S. authorities seem to have taken the view that individual privacy is almost always subject to national security concerns. Diversity among nations' practices, therefore, can produce situations where travel document problems are missed or overlooked. Malaysia is far from being the only country where the passports of outgoing passengers are not typically checked. While we do not yet know the exact sequence of events, it is possible that China would have checked the stolen passports had it been required to issue visas. But no visas were required because the tickets were for continuing travel to Amsterdam, Netherlands. It is possible, though not of course yet certain, that existing procedures meant that Malaysia in effect passed responsibility to China and that China deferred to the Netherlands. Thus, all three nations probably complied with their own procedures and were not in violation of any international law or practice. The lack of alignment among these various nations' procedures, however, meant that the passengers could use stolen travel documents to proceed through several security lines. The lessons from all of these national variations are clear: First, nations that develop their own security databases should still cross-check them with existing international systems such as Interpol. And second, the time has come for global coordination and standardized procedures for processing travel documentation: that includes not only widespread adoption of biometric travel documents, but also better coordination among nations as to where responsibility lies for checking documents that travelers use to identify themselves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Havel.","Brian Havel: It's not surprising that at least two on Malaysia flight had stolen passports .
He says how passengers treated on security lines varies with nations' regulations .
He says many Interpol member nations don't use database -- even U.S., EU differ on privacy .

"(CNN) -- ""Sons of Guns"" star Will Hayden lost his reality show, his company and his freedom when he was arrested Wednesday on rape charges. Hayden was booked on an aggravated rape charge at Louisiana's East Baton Rouge Parish jail on Wednesday, pending $200,000 bail, according to jail records. The arrest comes two weeks after Hayden was released on a $150,000 bond after his arrest on charges of child molestation and a crime against nature, according to Casey Rayborn Hicks, public information director of the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office. Because of the nature of the arrest, further details on the charges have been sealed by court order. The Discovery Channel, which did not comment on the first arrest on August 13, immediately canceled Hayden's show when news of Wednesday's arrest broke. ""Given the serious and horrific nature of the charges against Will Hayden, we have decided to halt further production of 'Sons of Guns' and cancel the series,"" the channel's statement said. The show is based on Red Jacket Firearms, a custom weapons company Hayden founded and ran in Louisiana. The show ended its fifth season in May. The gun company posted a statement on its website Wednesday saying it has ""initiated and received full legal separation as an entity"" from Hayden: ""With heavy hearts, we will be continuing to operate and ensure the fulfillment of new customer orders, back orders and to provide support to those affected by these new developments. WE are the Heart and Soul of Red Jacket and will remain steadfast in our commitment to quality and our customers, for years to come.""

"(CNN) -- Most of the shock that resounds after hearing that Robin Williams died Monday comes from its utter implausibility. How could Robin Williams, of all people, just stop breathing, moving and, most of all, talking? It's as though we've been told the moon spun out of orbit or that water no longer boiled, or froze, at the proper temperature. If Robin Williams is dead, then light no longer refracts, atoms no longer bond and gravity has gone out of business. Yes. It's that implausible. For many of us over the last 40 years or so, Robin Williams was an irresistible force of nature that nothing, not even the demons in his head or the sometimes regrettable consequences of their actions, could stop. If his motor ever ceased running, even for a second, his audiences rarely noticed it. They just stayed on the edge of their seats awaiting the next eruption, and were never disappointed by whatever inspired lunacy burst forth. Practically from the beginning, when we first saw him turn scripts from the 1978-82 ABC sitcom ""Mork and Mindy"" into staging areas for unalloyed free-form verbal jazz, Williams seemed in supernaturally perfect command of all the voices in his head. Whether delivering stand-up comedy or an introduction at a testimonial dinner, Williams could make a casual digression into a stream-of-consciousness lick worthy of William Faulkner, James Joyce or any surrealist you can name. Where did he ever come up with THAT, we always wondered, whether it was a reference to an old movie we'd thought we'd forgotten or a side-swiping barb at a politician, or even something embarrassing about himself. Patients remember Williams as 'comedic Mother Teresa' His own rueful experience with addiction drew from him one of the greatest quotes ever about drugs: ""Cocaine is God's way of saying you make too much money."" Or the one about how alcohol abuse can get so out-of-control, ""you'll do things that'd make the Devil say, 'Dude...'"" Someday soon, if it hasn't already happened, there will be a collection of such aphorisms, which at times approached the trenchant pithiness of Mark Twain or Oscar Wilde. The problem with remembering all of them now is that they were all but lost in the ack-ack fire of Williams' spontaneous inventions. Even when he stood still, you could almost feel the waves of energy struggling to break free. The way he contained those waves reminded us that his was a mind, paraphrasing Albert Camus, that always kept itself in check. And besides, good actors can always make silence and space work to their advantage. Imagine our surprise when it turned out that this most formidably intellectual of his generation's comedians was also a very good -- and, at times, great actor. He channeled his high-octane inventiveness into creating indelible and endearing movie portrayals as the hip GI disc jockey in 1987's ""Good Morning Vietnam,"" for which he received the first of his three Oscar nominations for best actor. I thought he should have won for playing a grief-mad widower in 1992's ""The Fisher King,"" but Hollywood showed how much they loved him by giving him the best supporting actor Oscar in 1998 for playing an emotionally wounded psychiatrist in ""Good Will Hunting."" For whatever it's worth, the Robin Williams movies I most enjoyed were the ones where he took chances and/or let fly. This would, for me, exclude his title role as ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" (though I understand why so many cherish its memory), but would include such wildly varied work as his supersonically spritzing genie in 1992's ""Aladdin""; his underrated star turn in the underrated 1980 musical ""Popeye""; and, among his riskiest performances, the portrayal of the clammy, anxiety-ridden hustler Tommy Wilhelm in the 1986 TV movie version of Saul Bellow's ""Seize the Day."" In all his roles, playing crazy or cute, good or evil, sagacious or sanctimonious, Robin Williams always showed you his considerable empathy, not just for the people he rendered, but for the audience; the same audience he sought to conquer, if not overpower, with his free-range comedy routines where, as with his friend and mentor Richard Pryor, he was most vividly and resoundingly himself--with all his foibles, grievances, fears and desires. We thought we'd be able to call upon his compassion, his intelligence and his energy for as long as there was air and water. Is Robin Williams really dead? What on Earth will the weather be like tomorrow without knowing he's still around? See more comedy content at CNN Comedy.","Gene Seymour: Robin Williams' death seems so implausible.

"(CNN) -- Uncertainty over the fate of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was further compounded Saturday by reports that two men whose names matched those on the passenger manifest had reported their passports stolen. Malaysian authorities apparently did not check the stolen documents on an international law enforcement agency database, CNN has learned. After the airline released a manifest of the 239 people on the plane, Austria denied that one of its citizens was on the flight as the list had stated. The Austrian citizen was safe and sound, and his passport had been stolen two years ago, Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Weiss said. Similarly, Italy's foreign ministry confirmed that no Italians were on the flight, even though an Italian was listed on the manifest. Malaysian officials said they were aware of reports that the Italian's passport was also stolen but had not confirmed it. On Saturday, Italian police visited the home of the parents of Luigi Maraldi, the man whose name appeared on the manifest, to inform them about the missing flight, said a police official in Cesena, in northern Italy. Maraldi's father, Walter, told police that he had just spoken to his son, who was fine and not on the missing flight, said the official, who is not authorized to speak to the media. Maraldi was vacationing in Thailand, his father said. The police official said that Maraldi had reported his passport stolen in Malaysia last August and had obtained a new one. U.S. law enforcement sources, however, told CNN they've been told that both documents were stolen in Thailand. Still, the missing passports raised concerns about the possibility of terrorism. A law enforcement official Saturday told CNN that various U.S. government agencies were briefed about the passports. The names of the persons whose passports were stolen have been circulated and checked, the official said. There's nothing at this point to indicate foul play on their part. The National Transportation Safety Board announced late Saturday that a team of its investigators was en route to Asia to help with the investigation, the agency said. ""They will be positioned to offer U.S. assistance,"" the NTSB said of the team, which also includes technical advisers from Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration. Plane bore painters, pilgrims, others from around the world . FBI help . The FBI is ready to send agents to Asia if requested by the Malaysian government, but no agents have been sent yet, U.S. officials familiar with the issue told CNN on Saturday night on condition of anonymity. Earlier Saturday, an official said FBI agents were heading to the area. U.S. authorities have not ruled out terrorism -- or anything else -- as a cause of the airliner's disappearance. CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director, was told by sources at Interpol, which keeps a database of lost or stolen travel documents, that the stolen Italian passport was in the agency's database. The reportedly stolen Austrian passport was not. Malaysian authorities apparently did not check Interpol's database, sources told Fuentes. ""Interpol's database has 39 million records of stolen travel documents at the present time,"" he said. ""One billion passengers a year board international flights where there's no inquiry made of that database. So it leaves an opening."" Referring to the stolen documents, Fuentes added, ""You wonder who was using it? What were their motives? Were they using it to check luggage in that matched the tickets, and maybe the luggage contained explosives? So, it's a great concern when people use false documents to board international aircraft."" Traces of oil spotted near area plane lost contact . A U.S. intelligence official said authorities had established ""no nexus to terrorism yet although that's by no means definitive. We're still tracking."" Malaysian authorities reiterated during a news conference that they are not ruling anything out regarding the missing aircraft. In the United States, Fuentes said, passports are routinely checked against the Interpol database. ""Even in the United states, we have a tremendous problem with our documentation, our driver's licenses,"" said Mary Schiavo, former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation. ""Everything can be forged and faked here. We certainly have a problem with that as well. But that's why you have the various checklists to check against and had they been identified as stolen passports ... there was a way to flag them in advance. That's what is disturbing, as it apparently wasn't checked."" China mystery . Schiavo also expressed surprise that two potentially stolen passports may have been used to board the flight. ""It's rare that you have one stolen passport, much less two stolen passports on a flight. It's starting to look like more than a coincidence,"" she said. She added it was especially surprising given the destination of the flight was Beijing. ""American citizens have to have visas ... and you can't get on board the plane without showing the visa,"" she explained. ""For a stolen passport, stolen two years ago -- these visas only last for a certain amount of time. So, did they (the authorities) not check? Did Beijing not clear or have to issue a visa? There are a lot of questions about these passports because the destination was Beijing."" First officer was transitioning to 777-200s . Safest part of flight . No one is sure what happened to the plane. Air traffic controllers lost track of it after it left Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, on its way to Beijing on Friday. The plane was cruising during what experts consider to be the safest part of the journey when it vanished. Greg Feith, a former investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, said there were multiple scenarios of what could have gone wrong, including structural problems with the wings or fuselage. ""Of course, you also have to look at in that part of the world and around the world there is still a potential for a terrorist act or an intentional act that could have rendered the airplane incapacitated,"" he said. He added: ""Whatever happened, happened very quickly. For them to have lost two-way radio communication with (air traffic control), two-way radio communication with the company, and to lose any kind of radar data with ground control facilities means that the airplane was compromised in a very quick manner and it may have been well beyond the control of the crew to keep the airplane under control and make any kind of emergency distress call or emergency landing.""

"(CNN) -- It's one of the more disturbing revelations to arise from an investigation into fatal delays in care at Veterans Affairs medical centers: Employee bonuses appear to be one factor behind the manipulation of patient wait times in at least one hospital. Two reports released this week -- one by the VA's inspector general and another by the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs -- indicate in some cases wait times were manipulated to meet employee performance goals needed for bonuses. The news has raised questions about just how widespread the practice was and who received the financial incentives. Answers from the VA have been harder to come by. Here's a look at what we know: . What did the reports reveal? At the Phoenix VA patient wait times were directly tied to VA employees' bonuses and raises. By manipulating doctor's appointments for the veterans, the wait time to see a doctor appeared to be shorter, a factor considered in VA employee bonuses and raises, according to a VA inspector general report said. The VA secretary's audit of a number of medical centers that concluded ""some front-line, middle, and senior managers felt compelled to manipulate"" the scheduling process to meet performance goals established by the agency. Who benefited? By all indications, from the reports and congressional testimony, the practice involved high-level managers in at least the Phoenix VA medical network. Neither report identified managers by name or position. How much money? There is no easy answer to this. Performance incentives are typically tied to a number of factors, and the VA has not detailed how much of a role patient wait times may have played. Who knew about it? There is no hard and fast answer. The first public revelation that salary increases and bonuses may have been a factor came with the release of the agency's inspector general report. The House Committee on Veterans Affairs also asked the question during a combative hearing this week, where Rep. Dan Benishek, R-Michigan, inquired whether there was a financial motivation to manipulate appointment schedules at the Phoenix VA. ""That is a discussion the (VA inspector general) is having,"" Dr. Thomas Lynch, the VA's assistant deputy undersecretary for clinical operations, said. How widespread is the problem? It appears the VA, itself, is still trying to answer that question, citing the ongoing inspector general's investigation. A final report is due in August. The issue of patient wait times is not an overall performance factor ordered by the VA, Lynch recently told the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. The factors tied to bonuses and raises are decided by each VA network, Lynch said. But the VA also appeared to indicate in its audit that its mandate to improve wait times may have played a role. As a result of the audit, the VA suspended financial incentives -- bonuses and salary increases -- for all Veterans Health Administration executives for the 2014 fiscal year.","A preliminary VA inspector general report reveals bonuses may have been a factor .

"(CNN) -- The Caribbean -- home to cerulean waters, vibrant coral reefs and sugar-white beaches -- is a near-perfect vacation destination, especially when it's arctic cold at home. There is just one problem: Everyone you know wants to go there. How to lose the crowds when seeking an ideal tropical getaway? Forget well-traveled spots, where the sprawling hotels are thicker than coconut palms. If you really want to leave the only footprints in the sand, go to one of the Caribbean's lesser-known islands. Petit St. Vincent, for example, a gem-like private island resort in the Grenadines, falls happily under the radar compared to its sister island, Mustique. ""We recently had a guest who wanted complete privacy for the two weeks that he was here,"" says Matt Semark, general manager of Petit St. Vincent. ""That's no problem at a place like this."" The guest, Semark says, sunned and swam at the hidden slice of beach fronting his hibiscus-edged cottage, took all his meals on his own spacious deck and wasn't faced with one other guest during his stay. Departures: Stunning hotel plunge pools . While not every under-hyped Caribbean island can offer that level of solitude, there are many that hit the mark or come close. Here are seven peaceful escapes: . Cayo Espanto . Just off the coast of Belize, this diminutive private island -- at just four acres, it contains six luxe private villas and one overwater bungalow -- has hosted a staggering list of seclusion-seeking A-listers (Tiger Woods and Leonardo DiCaprio among them). As befits such a clientele, every aspect of the experience here can be tailored to guests' whims. The chef customizes daily menus, and staffers arrange outings like guided bird-watching treks, tours of Mayan ruins and beachside aromatherapy couples' massages. Rooms start at $1,495; 910-323-8355; aprivateisland.com. 7 private island rentals . Dominica . Part of the Lesser Antilles, this large, jungle-covered island (much of which is a protected nature preserve) attracts mostly in-the-know ecotravelers. Stay at two-year-old Secret Bay (rooms from $360; 767-445-4444; secretbay.dm), set on a clifftop on the island's northwestern coast between two equally dazzling swimming beaches. (One has a hidden cave.) Guests stay in one of five tree house-style villas and bungalows, all built of Guyanese wood with floor-to-ceiling windows and outdoor showers. Activities include guided nature hikes, kayak expeditions and yoga in an open-air pavilion. Departures: Top private movie theaters . Guana Island . The 850 acres that comprise this British Virgin Island are home to more than 50 bird, 14 reptile and 200 plant and insect species, not to mention the myriad sea creatures that inhabit its waters. (The land is a protected wildlife sanctuary.) Guana's single private resort maintains some 12 miles of walking trails that allow guests to explore its tropical forests, seven beaches and sugar-plantation ruins on foot. The resort houses just 19 cottages and five lavish villas (the latter have private pools), along with a terrace restaurant, a small water-sport center and a bar for those who want to socialize. Rooms start at $695; 212-482-6247; guana.com. Isla Holbox . Despite its proximity to the perpetually thronged Riviera Maya, this 25-mile-long island off the northern tip of Mexico's YucatÃ¡n Peninsula has managed to stay sleepily unspoiled. Surprising, given that Isla Holbox is one of the best places on earth to snorkel among whale sharks -- enormous, harmless creatures that migrate to the waters here each year between June and September. Of the 20-odd lodging options, CasaSandra (rooms from $233; 52-984/875-2171) -- an elegant, 18-suite Mr & Mrs Smith resort with a top-notch seafood restaurant and daily whale-shark boat trips -- leads the charge. Departures: 10 top guest ranches . Kamalame Cay . Occupying a pristine, 96-acre private island off the north coast of Andros in the Bahamas, this boutique resort is still run by the same family that built it in the 1990s. The property, though, epitomizes modern barefoot chic, encompassing 19 breezy rooms and suites -- most with French doors, soaring Balinese-style peaked roofs and verandas overlooking the beach. The island sits adjacent to the Andros Barrier Reef (the third largest in the world), which teems with sea life; guests can explore with scuba and snorkeling excursions from the on-site dive center, guided half- or full-day bonefishing trips or borrowed kayaks from the resort's fleet. Rooms start at $407; 876-632-3213; kamalame.com. Peter Island . Though it's one of the largest British Virgin Islands, the nearly 2,000-acre Peter Island is private, unlike many of its neighbors. Yet its eponymous resort offers the sorts of amenities one would find at much larger properties, including a full-service, 15-slip yacht club; a 10,000-square-foot Ayurvedic spa; a dive shop and water-sports center; and several restaurants and bars (one of which hosts a weekly vintner's dinner). Many of the 55 spacious rooms, suites and villas are set directly off the stunning sweep of Deadman's Beach. Rooms start at $385; 800-346-4451; peterisland.com. Petit St. Vincent . Part of the Grenadines, this 115-acre private island resort is a luxurious place to unplug. There are no phones or Internet connectivity in the 22 seaside stone-and-timber villas, nor at the casual beach bar or the sumptuous tree-house spa or along the nearly two miles of shoreline. (There is, however, WiFi at the hilltop restaurant and reception area.) Instead of checking e-mails or uploading Instagram photos, guests can enjoy cruises aboard the resort's lovely traditional wood sailing sloop, snorkeling with sea turtles in the nearby Tobago Cays or lazing in one of the property's ubiquitous shady hammocks.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona are known for scoring truckloads of goals, but the Catalan side were celebrating their miserliness on Saturday as goalkeeper Claudio Bravo set a new La Liga record for time spent on the pitch without conceding. The Chilean international, who signed from Real Sociedad in the summer, has now played 630 minutes from the start of the season without letting in a goal. The old mark of 560 minutes set by former Barca gloveman Pedro Artola at the beginning of the 1977-78 season was passed in the 21st minute of the match against Rayo Vallecano. ""Everybody was talking about the record before the game,"" Bravo told reporters after the match. ""But I wasn't really thinking about the minutes, I was thinking more about the game and trying to be calm and concentrate. I just wanted to keep a clean sheet."" It was Luis Enrique's side's seventh clean sheet in a row as Lionel Messi and Neymar scored at the other end to seal a 2-0 win against nine-man Rayo at the Estadio de Vallecas. After passing 400 career goals last weekend, Lionel Messi now needs just two more goals to equal Telmo Zarra's all-time La Liga scoring record of 251. Victory moves Barcelona onto 19 points, two points clear of Valencia at the top of the table. Los Che also continued their unbeaten start to the season with a 3-1 win over champions Atletico Madrid at the Mestalla Stadium. Diego Simeone's side were also unbeaten in their opening six games but found themselves 3-0 down inside the opening quarter of an hour. Miranda's own goal and strikes by Andre Gomes and Nicolas Otamendi left the visitors reeling, before Mario Mandzukic's 29th minute goal gave Atletico hope. Guilherme Siqueira had a chance to narrow the deficit further but failed to convert his spot kick before a goalless second half ensued. Real Madrid will move ahead of their city rivals if they beat Athletic Bilbao at the Bernabeu on Sunday. Man City leave it late . Meanwhile in the English Premier League, champions Manchester City left it late against Aston Villa at Villa Park. Two goals in the final 10 minutes from Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero earned Manuel Pellegrini's side all three points, lifting the Sky Blues to second in the table behind Chelsea who entertain Arsenal at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Liverpool beat West Bromwich Albion 2-1 at Anfield to seal a first league win in four matches and lift Brendan Rodgers' side to sixth in the table. Bayern cruise to win . In the Bundesliga, Bayern Munich recorded a third straight league win hitting four past Hannover at the Allianz Arena. Arjen Robben and Robert Lewandowski both scored twice to keep Bayern on top of the table with 17 points. Hoffenheim kept touch with the leaders thanks to a 2-1 win over Schalke while Bayer Leverkusen scored a late equalizer to grab a point in a 2-2 draw with Paderborn. Borussia Dortmund's poor early season form continued with a 1-0 home defeat at the hands of Hamburg. Jurgen Klopp's side have picked up one point in the last four games, leaving them languishing in 13th place. Borussia Monchengladbach can move to within two points of Bayern if they beat Mainz on Sunday.","Claudio Bravo hasn't conceded a league goal all season .

"(CNN) -- An 11-year-old from Michigan said he is going to really wow his schoolmates Friday with the ""coolest"" show-and-tell item anyone's ever brought to the sixth grade. After all, it's not every day you get to show off a 13,000-year-old mastodon bone you and your cousin found in a stream behind your backyard. ""I thought it was a rock at first, but a couple minutes later I looked more at it, and I didn't think it was a dinosaur bone, but I wasn't sure,"" Eric Stamatin of Shelby Township Michigan told CNN on Thursday. He and Andrew Gainariu, 11, from Troy, Michigan, were hunting for crayfish in the stream that extends from the middle branch of the Clinton River, as they often did, when they ""got bored"" and decided to build a dam. They made an extraordinary discovery that June day. John Zawiskie, a geologist and paleontologist at the Cranbrook Institute of Science confirmed in early November that what the ""kids just being kids outside"" discovered was not a rock at all, but an axis, a specialized second vertebrae behind the skull in the spinal column of an American mastodon. ""These animals have been extinct for 10,000 years,"" Zawiskie told CNN. He works extensively on subjects in this time period, and noticed the distinct bone from the prehistoric elephant-like mammal right away. ""Oh my gosh, we were like psyched,"" Stamatin said of learning it was a real mastodon bone. ""I was like I think we are the first people in Michigan to find a bone (who) are only 11 years old."" The mastodon, which is Michigan's state fossil, is common to the geographic landscape, according to Zawiskie. He said more than 200 discoveries have been made in the southern half of Michigan over the past 150 years, usually by farmers or construction crews. The large mammals became extinct because of nomadic hunters causing new stress for the population and a very abrupt climate change, dubbed the ""Younger Dryas"" period, when temperatures reversed to glacial conditions. ""There are just incredible stories beneath us, about how Earth changed in the past,"" Zawiskie said. ""Every once in a while -- by construction workers, or exploring 11-year-old boys and girls -- something like this comes to the forefront and reminds us of the incredible history of Earth's landscape."" Cristina Stamatin, Eric's mother, said when the boys stumbled in the house with the discovery her first thought was ""oh my goodness, what did they bring home?"" She told CNN she thought it was a cow's bone. ""It's been sitting on dining room shelf since last June,"" Stamatin said. She reached out to the paleontologist in November. ""John, Dr. John the scientist as my son calls him, was over my house within an hour after me e-mailing him to say 'you won't believe what you discovered'"" the mother explained. When they first discovered the mass with a large hole in it, Andrew Gainariu told CNN, ""I said it's obviously a dinosaur bone, but my cousin said 'no.'"" ""I told Eric, you really want to go there? I bet 100 bucks it is a dinosaur bone, because I have always been fascinated with bones,"" Gainariu continued. The bet hasn't been settled because the boys have since learned it's not a dinosaur bone, but that of an extinct mammoth. Gainariu said this experience has him thinking about maybe becoming a paleontologist, but he is still considering being a lawyer ""and other things too."" Stamatin said he is a bit nervous about his presentation Friday. ""I am bringing the bone tomorrow, and I am going to make a poster and explain to every science class in sixth grade what a mastodon is,"" he told CNN. ""I feel really special. People said it's just amazing how I found this."" The boys are mulling over what they are going to do with the fossil. ""Andrew said maybe we can sell it, and that we could be famous... but I guess we are famous already,"" Stamatin said. ""We are still in the thinking process of putting it on eBay or giving it to the museum,"" Gainariu clarified Thursday. ""I have been thinking of selling it and making money off it,"" Gainariu continued, ""but who is going to pay 2,000 bucks for a bone?""

"(CNN) -- On 9 March 2010 I stood outside the international bus terminal on ErdbergstraÃŸe in Vienna, waiting for the 11 a.m. bus from Zagreb to arrive. It was cold and breezy, typical of March in the Austrian capital. A steady stream of tourists emerged from the buses and headed to see the palaces of the Habsburgs. Jed had told me there would be a CIA team shadowing me. I looked at a man in a cowboy hat on the street corner checking his watch. Surely they would not be that obvious. Then I saw her. She wore a long black skirt as I had anticipated, but instead of being fully veiled, she was wearing a simple headscarf. A few stray strands of blonde hair fluttered in the breeze. 'As salaam aleikum. I'm Aminah,' she said in soft-accented English, fixing me with her blue-green eyes. Despite the fact that Awlaki had instructed me to wear Western clothes to avoid suspicion, I had to keep my distance from a woman who was not related to me. I didn't even shake her hand. But I was impressed; the photos had not done her justice. Aminah was strikingly pretty, with full lips, high cheekbones and an angular nose. She looked several years younger than her age, thirty-two. Gwyneth Paltrow, I thought -- Anwar will love this girl. I had come across her on a Facebook fan page for Awlaki in November 2009 -- two months after he had repeated his request that I find him a wife in the West. I had left a message on the site requesting support and Aminah had replied. 'What kind of support and are you in direct contact with Shaikh?' she wrote in her first message on 28 November 2009. Two days later, after we exchanged several messages, she wrote this: . 'I have one question tho. Do you know personally AAA? And if it is so, may I be so liberal to ask you something? AAA was our code for Anwar al-Awlaki. 'Yes I do know him. Feel free to ask,' I replied immediately. She had written back: . 'I sent Shaikh a letter by mail, I am not sure if I had his correct email address, but actually I was wondering will he search for a second wife, I proposed him a marriage, and I do not know how silly it is. But I tried. Now, as I am in contact with you there is a possibility for you to get know me better in a way you can recommended me. 'I seek a way how to get out of this country, and I search a husband who will teach me and whom I can help a lot. I deeply respect him and the all things he do for this Ummah and I want to help him in any way.' I wrote back: . 'You will be wife number 3, as he already got two wives, however he don't stay with them because they are in the capital, and only see him now and then. But you will stay with him all the time, as you don't have a family there. You should expect hardship, and moving from place to place once in a while. Taking care of your duties in house as a wife. Be patience with all what you will see and face, as AAA may be expose to danger etc. and Allah is our protector. Can you accept this?' She replied within ten minutes: . 'I would go with him anywhere, I am 32 years old and I am ready for dangerous things, I am not afraid of death or to die in the sake of Allah. I didn't know he has 2 wife already. But I do not mind at all. I want to help him in his work ... I am good in housekeeping job [and] I'm willing to be a very hardworking and active wife.'

"(CNN) -- Jerome Champagne, the only candidate currently standing against FIFA president Sepp Blatter, is resolutely refusing to take the gloves off against his rival in the race to decide who will lead football's world governing body. Given the criticism Sepp Blatter and his organization has faced over its governance in recent years some might argue Champagne has been presented with a virtual own goal for his campaign -- but not a bit of it. ""Blatter is not corrupt,"" Champagne told CNN's World Sport. ""I'm not here to defend Blatter but I want him to be a responsible candidate and an efficient president."" England's Football Association chairman Greg Dyke recently described a FIFA meeting as ""like something out of North Korea"" in which the organization's federations adopted an attitude to Blatter of ""hail to the leader."" But Champagne rejected the idea that Blatter ruthlessly controls things from the top, rather seeing the man who has been at FIFA's helm for the past 16 years as akin to the leader of a democratically elected head of state. ""The FIFA president, according to the constitution of FIFA, he's not a dictator, said Champagne. ""I give you an example. In the UK, which is a democracy, British people vote for the Prime Minister. When the Prime Minister is elected, he or she has a right to set up a cabinet in order to implement the program that he or she has been elected for. ""That's democracy and of course he or she will be controlled by the Parliament, by the house. You think the FIFA President can choose the government to implement the program he has been elected for the 209 federations? Not at all."" While describing the 78-year-old Blatter as someone ""who is married with football,"" Champagne insisted the organization needed ""fresh air."" The 56-year-old former FIFA insider added: ""The issue is not the person, it's the program, it's the vision. It's what we do with the tools, with the administration,"" he says. ""I'm not happy with the situation of FIFA and I'm not happy with the situation of football. I think football is an amazing tool and FIFA can be an amazing machine to have a model of world governance. ""That's why I decided to run. It's about taking risks. If you don't take risks in your life nothing will happen."" The Frenchman's insistence on playing the ball and not the man may have something to do with his former life as a diplomat, but equally it may be informed by an intimate knowledge of how the Swiss-based organization operates. The 56-year-old spent 11 years with FIFA employing his diplomatic skills in the footballing arena as director of international relations from 1999 to 2010. During his time there, Champagne worked closely with Blatter, tasked with overseeing improvements in relations with national associations and other international sporting bodies including the International Olympic Committee. After being relieved of his duties at FIFA at the beginning of 2010 for reasons never fully explained, Champagne set up as an independent consultant advising a number of clubs and associations including the Kosovo Football Federation and the Palestine Football Association. The relationship with the latter has focused on establishing a professional league in the state as well promoting better relations with Israel's Football Association and National Olympic Committee. However, given Champagne's previous close links with Blatter's controversial stewardship, can the Frenchman be trusted to deliver sweeping reforms? ""I hope, I believe I can and also I believe we need (it),"" he insists. ""I don't mind when people are telling me: 'you worked with Blatter, how can you be the face of change?' ""Fine, we can debate that and I can show what I have done when I was there ... So listen, it's part of democracy and that's why I decided to stand."" Last week, Blatter tweeted that FIFA was taking the lead in acting ""ethically,"" despite the organization facing criticism over the the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup. Champagne's enthusiasm to expose his own record to public scrutiny is something that FIFA should be doing with U.S. lawyer Michael Garcia's report into that bidding process, the Frenchman argues. FIFA wants to keep the report private, but Garcia, who passed his report to FIFA's ethics chief Hans-Joachim Eckert earlier this month, says it should be made public. ""We need to know what happened,"" said Champagne. ""A judicial process which is open where the citizen can buy the process, can be part of the process knowing why a person is indicted and the person is innocent or guilty. ""It's very important and I think the release of the report is very important because it will be a part of the rebuilding of the image of FIFA because it's definitely needed."" FIFA members will elect a new president in May 2015. Read more: Garcia wants World Cup report to be made public .","Sepp Blatter isn't corrupt nor is he a dictator, says Jerome Champagne .

"(CNN) -- A decade after Elizabeth Smart's kidnapping ended, she is sharing intimate details of her 9-month-long nightmare. Smart, now 25 and married, spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper Monday about her book ""My Story,"" which she said tells 100% of what happened to her. ""I didn't just want to go 10% and sugarcoat the rest,"" Smart told Cooper. ""I wanted it to be really what happened and what it was like every single day I was there, because I don't think I'm doing anyone any favors by sugarcoating it."" Her motivation for opening up is the realization that people don't often acknowledge the ""just staggering"" fact that one in four girls and one in six boys are sexually abused before age 18. ""I want to reach out to those survivors and those victims,"" Smart said. ""I want them to know that these things do happen, but that doesn't mean that we have to be defined by it for the rest of your life. You can move forward and you can be happy."" Abused but alive: Lessons for Cleveland's survivors . Smart's abduction . Smart's horrific story began on the night of June 5, 2002, when Brian David Mitchell dragged the 14-year-old from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City home. ""To me, in my bedroom is the ultimate place in safety,"" she said. ""I mean, I felt like that was the safest place in the world for me, so waking up in the middle of the night in my own bedroom having this strange man standing over me, someone I didn't recognize, not only that but having a knife being held to my throat, I was terrified. I had grown up in a very happy home and I really didn't know what the definition of fear was until that moment. That brought whole new meaning."" The street preacher threatened the child unless she left with him quietly, she said. ""He said 'I have a knife at your neck, don't make a sound, get up and come with me,'"" Smart told Cooper. ""And then I remember getting up and going with him, and then on the way through my house he bent over to my ear again and said 'If you make any sound, if you do anything that causes any attention or causes someone to come, I not only will kill you, but I will kill anyone who tries to stop me.'"" Smart described the first hours of her ordeal, when she was ""praying so hard for an escape."" ""I kept looking, I kept waiting for something to happen, for some way for me to get away,"" she said. ""I kept looking and it didn't happen. When I didn't see an escape route, I thought 'Oh, my goodness, I'm going to be raped and then I'm going to be murdered, because that's what happens to all of the other kids I've ever seen on the news who had been kidnapped."" Mitchell forced her to hike with him for hours that morning, away from her home, she said. ""I remember stopping him and asking him 'Well, if you're going to rape and kill me, could you please do it here?' because, in my mind, I wanted my parents to know what had happened to me,"" she said. ""I wanted them to know that I hadn't run away, that this wasn't my choosing, I wasn't upset with them. I wanted them to know what had happened to me."" Mitchell's response was chilling. ""I remember he just looked back at me and said, 'Oh, I'm not going to rape and kill you yet.' And then we kept going and I remember we got a little further and I stopped him again and I said 'Well, don't you realize what you're doing, I mean, if you get caught you'll spend the rest of your life in prison?' And he looked at me again and he said, 'Well, I know exactly what I'm doing and I know what the consequences are. The only difference is I'm not going to get caught.'"" After several hours, they arrived in a mountainside camp where Mitchell's wife, Wanda Barzee, was waiting. ""I was terrified when I got to the camp, but the scariest thing about the camp was this woman,"" she said. ""I remember she came out and she had on robes and she had on a headdress and she came up to me and she hugged me. But this hug was not comforting. I mean, if hugs could speak this hug would have said, 'You're mine, you will do exactly what I tell you to do.'"" Lessons from 'America's Most Wanted': Never give up . Nine months of terror . The constant sexual abuse by Mitchell began that day. ""The next nine months, my days consisted of being hungry, of being bored to death because he talked nonstop always about himself,"" she said. ""I mean, talk about self-absorbed. And then my days consisted of being raped. I mean, not just once, multiple times a day."" While Smart's story is about hope and survival, the details are filled with despair. ""Every time I thought 'OK, this is rock bottom,' I mean, my pajamas have been taken away from me and I'm being forced to wear this nasty robe, the next thing I knew they'd say, 'We're going to have you go naked now,' or I had been forced to drink alcohol, which I had never done before,"" she told Cooper. ""I would throw up and I would pass out and when I'd wake up I'd find that my face and my hair was just crusted to the ground in vomit. I mean, just every time I thought it couldn't get worse, something always happened."" Smart said she eventually decided she would be a survivor and she would get back to her family. Smart's rescue on March 12, 2003, was followed by second-guessing by people who wondered why she hadn't escaped on her own.

And I had seen this man successfully kidnap me, he successfully chained me up, he successfully raped me, he successfully did all of these things.

"(CNN) -- The first season of Aaron Sorkin's HBO drama ""The Newsroom"" bitterly divided viewers: Some embraced its depiction of the fast-paced world of cable news. Others found it overwrought and tuned in to ""hate-watch"" as the show dramatized current events to reveal the inner workings of the media. ""The Newsroom"" returns for season two on Sunday, and according to Jeff Daniels, who plays crotchety TV news anchor Will McAvoy, the show has found its groove. When we last left McAvoy, he was comparing the Republican tea party to the American Taliban on television. The season two opener takes place just a few weeks later, and McAvoy is facing the consequences of his words. Over the course of the 10 new episodes, the series will explore themes like Occupy Wall Street and a fictional story that rocks the network called Operation Genoa. Daniels spoke with CNN about getting back into character, McAvoy's Googling habits and his next project: the long-rumored sequel to the 1994 comedy ""Dumb and Dumber."" CNN: Where do we find Will McAvoy at the beginning of season two? Jeff Daniels: Will is trying to get his life back together. He's hoping (the tea party uproar) blows over eventually and he can go back to doing what he does in the way that he likes to do it. But the Genoa story takes over. And what they do in the Genoa story makes what he did with the tea party pale in comparison. CNN: As an actor, what was interesting about playing Will this season? Daniels: The most exciting thing for me was that I knew who he was, going in. When you go from movie to movie to movie, you're creating different characters every time, and you're discovering them each time. For all the actors (on ""The Newsroom""), we made a lot of those discoveries on season one. We were winging it. Season one really was, for Aaron (Sorkin) on down, a first draft. We're a lot of really smart people who have done really successful things over the years, but we were still guessing. So season two really felt like I knew the guy. I owned him. It was a whole different way of walking into a scene and feeling like the character was very familiar. CNN: Will this season center on any big newsworthy moments, like the 2012 presidential election? Daniels: There are some, yeah. We certainly are covering the primaries and the leadup to the election. But mainly, it's this Genoa story, a fictional story that the network is chasing. The other stories, while they do pop up, are more secondary. CNN: It seems like fans of ""The Newsroom"" are really interested in knowing how closely your own views align with your character's. Is that something you feel the need to address? Daniels: They are fascinated by that, aren't they? It seems really important that they know. I can see why they would want to know that. You know what's more important? What Will thinks. Let me put it this way: I'm doing some acting. I'll say that. CNN: Are you familiar with the Will McAvoy Twitter account someone started? Daniels: If Will were real, I think he would be thrilled. I have a Twitter account, but I don't dare look at what anyone twits me -- I can't say tweets, so I say twits. I can't even bear it. I've never Googled, myself so I'm not about to scroll through what people are sending my way. I was aware that there is a Drunk Will McAvoy account and maybe even a Will McAvoy account. Have I been to it? No. Will would. Will loves to Google himself. CNN: There's a really notable balance on the show between the serious high stakes of the newsroom and humorous moments. Why is that important? Daniels: It's like life, where people say these very funny things right before they do very serious stuff. Humor is what keeps us sane. It's very smart humor. Very fast humor. These people get each other's jokes. It's these human beings with weaknesses and senses of humor. That's what Aaron does well: He writes complete people with flaws. It's coming from these people that, to us as we're doing it, feel real. CNN: Do you have any sense of whether the newsroom on the show is true to the feeling of an actual newsroom? Daniels: We're not shooting a documentary. It's fictional. I imagine that on a breaking news day, our fictionalized version comes close. When you dramatize something and put cameras in front of it, you take out the boring parts. I have a feeling that it's probably relatively authentic, which is what we're going for. CNN: Did you spend any time in a newsroom or with real reporters to prepare for the role of Will? Daniels: No. It was frightening how little research I did for this. I did think about all those newsrooms I've been in over the years promoting movies. It's not the same as being there when there's breaking news, but it's certainly helpful. I felt like I had enough of an awareness of what was going on to make up the rest. That's where the joy of acting comes, the making up the rest. If you've researched something to the end of its life, it becomes math. And I'm not good at math. I really like the ""what if"" of it all. CNN: On a less highbrow note, what's the status of the ""Dumb and Dumber"" sequel? Daniels: We're told that ""Dumb and Dumber To"" could be shooting in September, and I hope it does. And if it is, I'll be having a lot of fun with Jim Carrey this fall. And then I'd hopefully come back for ""The Newsroom's"" season three. CNN: Will that transition from ""The Newsroom"" to ""Dumb and Dumber To"" be strange? Daniels: Well, the drop in intelligence is more than a little frightening. To go from Will McAvoy's IQ to Harry Dunne's, which I believe is an IQ of eight. That's quite a drop. My fear is that if we do come back for a third season that there will be portions of Harry that creep into Will, and I don't think that serves ""The Newsroom"" well.

"(CNN) -- Syrian security forces in last Friday's bloody demonstrations blocked wounded protesters from getting medical care, a humanitarian watchdog said on Tuesday, citing witness accounts. The developments occurred in the Syrian cities of Daraa and Harasta, where many casualties occurred as protesters clashed with security forces, Human Rights Watch said. Security forces ""stopped medical personnel and others from reaching wounded protesters"" and ""prevented injured protesters from accessing hospitals,"" the group said. ""To deprive wounded people of critical and perhaps life-saving medical treatment is both inhumane and illegal,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Human Rights Watch Middle East director. ""Barring people from needed medical care causes grave suffering and perhaps irreparable harm."" One witness in Daraa, in the south near Jordan, said ""the security forces did not allow the ambulances to approach the road to pick up the wounded, and kept shooting when other protesters tried to carry the wounded away."" Another witness said he saw three people struck by bullets and carried into the Omari mosque, where he saw about 10 wounded protesters, ""three of whom died from their wounds while he was still in the mosque."" ""People were lying on the floor (of the Omari mosque), all over the place, and there were a couple of doctors and nurses, and also local women struggling to help the injured. But they could not do much -- they only had the basic supplies brought from the local pharmacies; the hospitals were blocked by the security forces and it was impossible to bring the necessary equipment or supplies into the mosque. Several people with serious injuries were dying, and there was nothing we could do to help them,"" the witness said. In Harasta, near Damascus, witnesses gave accounts of security forces ""firing on protesters seeking to help the wounded."" Two doctors who treated the wounded told Human Rights Watch  ""that it was impossible to bring the injured into the hospital because it was surrounded by the security forces."" ""I was in the hospital in the afternoon, when I started getting calls from people asking for help. I knew people could not bring the wounded in -- the hospital was surrounded by the security personnel. We also couldn't send an ambulance, fearing the security forces would open fire, as happened in other places,"" one of the doctors said. ""I rushed out and went to private homes where the rescuers brought the wounded. I could not take any major supplies or tools; only the most basic things. The injuries were serious and we had nothing to work with -- in one case, we had to probe a wound with a metal spoon to see how deep the bullet went."" The family of an injured protester tried to get treatment for the victim at a military hospital, but were rebuffed because civilians couldn't get treatment there. Security at a civilian hospital said only service members and not wounded civilians could get treatment. Protests started in Syria more than three weeks ago, erupting in Daraa and then spreading to other cities. The Syrian government, which says it is working to respond to citizen grievances, blames foreigners and instigators for infiltrating peaceful demonstrations and feeding violent confrontations. But Syrian activists say government forces are violently suppressing their peaceful demonstrations, using tear gas and live fire against unarmed civilians, raiding homes, and making dozens of arrests. The violence has alarmed the international community. The British Foreign Office on Tuesday is now advising ""against all but essential travel"" to Syria as a result of the country's ""deteriorating security situation."" Syria's leaders talk about political reform, but they meet their people's legitimate demands for reform with bullets,"" said Whitson. ""They accuse the protesters of inciting divisions in Syria's society, but the violence of their security forces is what is harming Syria the most."" The National Organization for Human Rights in Syria, an activist group, said there were 37 demonstrators killed across the country on Friday, including 30 in Daraa province, four in Damascus province and three in Homs province. Human Rights Watch said it ""confirmed that at least 28 people were killed"" in protests on Friday --  27 in Daraa and one in Douma. It said it couldn't get ""reliable information"" about casualties during protests in other towns. Syria said 19 security forces were killed in Daraa on Friday and dozens of others were injured in violence caused by ""armed groups"" firing at citizens and ""unarmed security forces.""","The incidents in question occurred in Daraa and Harasta .

"(CNN) -- Abbas Khan's family had been preparing for a homecoming in Britain after learning that Syria's government was going to release him. The 32-year-old orthopedic surgeon was arrested for entering Syria without a visa more than a year ago after volunteering to treat wounded victims of that country's civil war. After his mother personally pleaded with top Syrian officials to free him, they appeared to have relented. A member of the House of Commons, George Galloway, was planning to fly to Damascus to bring him home on Friday. Instead, his family was told that Khan was dead by his own hand, found hanging in his cell -- a report his brother called ""absolute slander"" Tuesday. ""All the signs were that they were teeing him up for release ... and now somehow, in a shroud of mystery, he's just hung himself,"" the brother, Shah Nawaz Khan, told CNN. ""It makes no sense."" Their grief came as Syrian government aircraft pounded the city where Khan was arrested for a third day, killing more than 70 people, opposition activists reported. Khan had been volunteering in Aleppo, the country's largest city, when he was taken into custody in November 2012, his brother said. He had always wanted to put his medical degree to work for relief agencies, and began working with a charity in Turkey that summer, his brother said. ""There's no suggestion he was there for anything other than just humanitarian causes,"" he said. 'I think he's been silenced' Khan was on his second trip into Syria, having crossed the border through a checkpoint manned by the rebel Free Syrian Army when he was arrested, Shah Nawaz Khan said. ""It may be naive, but he understood some of the risks there, to help people on the ground there,"" he said. ""He worked 40 hours nonstop, operating on critically injured individuals, saving the lives of women and children."" Then he ""disappeared off the radar."" His family learned of his arrest six months later via diplomats from India, their ancestral home, Shah Nawaz Khan told CNN. His mother flew to Damascus, where she ""rung every bell, knocked on every door and groveled"" in an attempt to secure his release. Syrian officials eventually transferred Khan from military custody to a civilian lockup, where his mother was allowed to visit, Shah Nawaz Khan said. He was emaciated and showed ""clear signs of maltreatment,"" but his condition had improved before his transfer. He wrote letters home ""almost every other day,"" the last telling them his release appeared to be in the works. Instead, they were told Monday that he had killed himself. ""It's just trying to defend them against the indefensible,"" Shah Nawaz Khan said. ""He's been summarily executed without trial or due process ... I think he's been silenced for whatever he might have to say."" In a statement posted online Tuesday, Galloway -- the fiery leftist and political celebrity -- said he had been working with Syrian officials for months to try to secure Khan's release and had been scheduled to bring him home from Damascus at week's end. ""I think we will have to wait for clarification on how exactly he died, but this is heartbreaking and devastating news for his family who have been working so hard for so long to secure his release,"" he said. ""Particularly because his freedom had been agreed and he was due to return with me in the next few days. My sincere condolences go out to his family, whose pain is unbearable."" There was no immediate comment on Khan's death from Syrian government agencies. From metropolis to battlefield . More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria's nearly 3-year-old civil war, according to the United Nations. In Aleppo, the relief agency Doctors Without Borders said hospitals have been ""overwhelmed"" by casualties after waves of airstrikes using so-called barrel bombs: drums packed with explosives and shrapnel and dropped by helicopters. ""For the past three days, the helicopters have been targeting different areas, among them a school and the Haydarya roundabout, where people wait for public transport vehicles,"" said Aitor Zabalgogeazkoa, a Doctors Without Borders coordinator in Syria. ""In both cases, there were dozens of dead and injured people. A dozen bodies were being lined up in front of three hospitals waiting to be recovered by the families."" By Tuesday, new attacks had killed 73 people, including five children, bringing the three-day toll to 212, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency did not explicitly mention the use of barrel bombs Tuesday, but said ""armed terrorist groups were entirely eliminated"" in several parts of Aleppo. State media often describes opposition forces bent out ousting President Bashar al-Assad as ""terrorists."" Tuesday's carnage follows two days of intense bloodshed in what was once Syria's economic hub. At least 83 people were killed Sunday by aerial bombing in Aleppo, including 27 children, the LCC said. Another 56 people died there Monday from similar attacks, the dissident group said. Entire buildings have been flattened in the blasts, the opposition Syrian National Coalition said. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf decried the alleged use of barrel bombs. ""We strongly condemn the latest development from over the weekend that the Assad regime has dropped barrel bombs in and around Aleppo, killing dozens, including women and children,"" she said. ""These bombs and the explosive materials contained within them further underscore the brutality of the Assad regime and the lengths they will go to attack and kill their own people."" Syria's descent into civil war began in March 2011, when Assad's regime forcefully cracked down on peaceful anti-government protesters.

"(CNN) -- The age rating for new mobile video-sharing app Vine has been raised to 17+, meaning appropriate for users 17 and older, after it was flooded with pornographic images. Since its launch two weeks ago, the Twitter-owned Vine had been rated 12+ in Apple's App Store, the only place it is currently available. But sexually explicit video clips almost immediately began appearing within the app, including one mistakenly showcased in its ""Editor's Picks"" section, drawing outrage from some users. The new rating, for such criteria as ""frequent/intense sexual content or nudity,"" means users wishing to download Vine must click on a window promising that they are over 17. There is no age-verification system, however, and nothing to stop younger users from downloading the app. The changes are part of an update to Vine, announced Wednesday, that also allow users to block or report a profile they find offensive. Does Twitter's Vine have a porn problem? Twitter had already taken steps last week to restrict how users can share sexually explicit clips. Hashtags for such search terms as ""porn,"" ""nude,"" ""sex"" and ""naked"" no longer delivered any results. The issue made headlines January 28 when Vine users noticed a video of what was described as hardcore pornography showcased in the prominent Editor's Picks section of the mobile app. Twitter pulled the clip and apologized, saying it was a mistake. Tumblr, the popular blogging platform that includes some porn among its roughly 92 million blogs, soon afterwards reclassified itself with the 17+ tag. Apps are typically submitted to Apple with a suggested age rating, although Apple can request that the rating be changed. In the App Store, 17+ is the most restrictive rating.

"(CNN) -- It's been 31 years since Stanley Guidroz first reported his 3-year-old son missing in Tacoma, Washington. Investigators, after reopening the cold case, now say the boy, Wallace Guidroz, was never missing at all and that his father had killed him. Guidroz, 57, has been charged with first-degree manslaughter after he confessed to the crime, said Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist on Tuesday. ""This is another success for the Cold Case Unit,"" said Lindquist. ""Justice matters, no matter how long it takes."" Guidroz first reported his son missing in January 1983, telling Tacoma police that his son had gone missing in a neighborhood park after they had gone fishing together. Guidroz said he believed that a family they had met in the park had kidnapped him, prosecutors said. Police were unable to locate a family that fit the description Guidroz gave them, and they were unable to connect Guidroz to the boy's disappearance. For years, the mystery of what happened to Wallace remained unsolved. Guidroz left Washington state in 1984 and did not return, according to a press release from the Pierce County Prosecutor's Office. In 2011, Cold Case Unit Detective Gene Miller reopened the case. Miller reviewed old documents from the initial investigation and saw that Guidroz's stories never seemed to add up. There were ""several inconsistencies in Guidroz's account of the events from the day Wallace went missing,"" the release said. Guidroz resurfaced in Louisiana in March 2011 after reports that he had been charged in the killing of his wife, who is not the mother of Wallace. Guidroz was convicted of fatally stabbing his wife multiple times after they had gotten into an argument. He drove around aimlessly with her body in the back of his car before driving to a nearby police station and confessing to the murder, according to CNN affiliate WWL. Miller traveled to Louisiana to question Guidroz about Wallace's disappearance. Though Guidroz initially provided several more versions of his original story, he reportedly admitted to killing his son. Guidroz said he and Wallace returned home after going fishing, but that he ""lost it"" after Wallace began fussing in his high chair. Guidroz said he hit the toddler, which caused the boy to fall to the floor and hit his head. Wallace wasn't responsive after the fall and Guidroz told Miller that he ""knew he was dead"" but that he was afraid of being labeled a ""child killer"" in prison. Guidroz buried Wallace near the Tacoma waterfront and then called police to report him missing, prosecutors said. Guidroz is currently being held in a Louisiana prison for his wife's murder. A warrant has been issued for Guidroz to return to Washington state, prosecutors say. It is unclear whether Guidroz has retained an attorney. NY businesswoman accused of killing autistic son .

"(CNN) -- Last September, William Jeffrey Dumas was convicted of three counts of rape. According to the charges, he had raped a woman three times over a night and the following morning, and the jury agreed with the prosecution that he was guilty. But just last week, a judge overturned the jury's conviction and ordered a new trial. The Georgia appeals court judge, Christopher McFadden, argued that the verdict went ""strongly against the weight of the evidence"" because, in his judgment, the woman in question -- I'll join other writers in calling her Jane -- didn't act like a victim and the man didn't act like a rapist. Jane has Down syndrome and the growing national outrage to this case has focused, with reason, on her disability. But Down syndrome is only part of the story. The outrage is not only because this judge didn't understand Down syndrome, but that judges frequently impose their perceptions on cases of sexual assault, reducing sentences even for convicted rapists on the grounds that the victim didn't act ""correctly."" Jane's troubling case reveals the intersections between rape culture and the way we strip agency from people with disabilities. Here are a few details. In October of 2010, Jeffrey Dumas was hanging out with friends in a home where a 24-year-old woman with Down syndrome was staying while her mother was out of town. According to the complaint, Dumas raped the woman three times over an evening and the following morning, but she made no ""outcry"" until the following day, despite having ample opportunities to tell the other adults in the house. People with intellectual disabilities, especially women and girls, are sexually assaulted at a much higher rate than the rest of the population. People with intellectual disabilities, even those with strong communication skills, can be vulnerable to sexual assault because they are unsure of what's right or wrong or whether they can say no. They rarely receive sexual education or are provided assertiveness training. Given this context, one might well invoke Down syndrome to explain the delay between the assault and the complaint. Most important, during the trial, Jane testified that she was raped, the jury believed her, and the medical and physical evidence confirmed her story. But the judge, acting as he says in his decision, as the 13th juror, saw things differently. McFadden writes that although ""the evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction,"" he offers a long list of confusing aspects in the testimony, which he boils down to, ""At no time prior to her outcry on the 19th (the next day), did (she) behave like a victim. Nor did Mr. Dumas behave like someone who had recently perpetrated a series of violent crimes against her."" I don't pretend to know what happened on the night of October 18 in the Fayetteville, Georgia, home. But I do know that what happened in the courtroom is not just about disability and agency, but about rape and the way authorities respond to women's testimony. Down syndrome may be a reason this judge decided that Jane's words carried less weight when measured against his perception, but many nondisabled women, women of all social classes, races, sexual orientations, and levels of ability, have experienced precisely the same kind of dismissal. Here are a few examples that do not involve disability. Last year in Montana, a judge reduced a former teacher's rape conviction to 31 days because the victim, a 14-year-old girl, was ""as much in control of the situation"" as her rapist and, in his opinion, ""older than her chronological age."" In California, a judge reduced a sentence of a convicted rapist because the woman didn't fight hard enough. The judge said, ""If someone doesn't want to have sexual intercourse, the body shuts down. The body will not permit that to happen unless a lot of damage is inflicted, and we heard nothing about that in this case. That tells me that the victim in this case, although she wasn't necessarily willing, she didn't put up a fight."" In Arizona, a judge reduced a sentence of a police officer convicted of sexual abuse to community service and probation, instead blaming the victim for being in a bar. The judge said, ""If you wouldn't have been there that night, none of this would have happened to you. ... When you blame others, you give up your power to change."" In Alabama, a judge structured a 40-year sentence for rape  so the rapist would serve two years in a community program for nonviolent criminals and three years of probation at home. The judge, much like McFadden, argued that the victim just didn't behave correctly. He said, ""You didn't hear the evidence. The original allegation was that both of these crimes were forcible. But then you have to believe that although she was forcibly raped twice, she continued to come back and have a social relationship (with the rapist)."" Other women have been prosecuted for false reporting of rape because they didn't ""act traumatized."" Rape convictions have been vacated entirely because the victim didn't fight back, such as in Connecticut, when the state supreme court freed a rapist because his victim, a woman with cerebral palsy and a mental age of 3, with no ability to speak, didn't bite, kick, or scratch her attacker. As disability blogger Sarah Levis has commented, all of these stories should push our attention to this aspect of rape culture in the courtroom. Rape culture creates the myth that victims of rape must react within a predictable set of norms or raise doubts about the legitimacy of the rape. All of these women, including Jane, behaved in a way that judges didn't understand, so they overturned convictions or reduced sentences. And here is where disability comes back into play. Because of her Down syndrome, Jane is relatively immune to the kinds of victim-blaming endured by other women who are assaulted or abused. We know she wasn't asking for it. We can't blame her for staying in the house while Dumas got drunk. We know she didn't encourage him, then change her mind the next day. All of the myths about false reporting of rape don't apply to Jane because of her disability, and for that at least we can be thankful. Jane's experience points to the offensive way women's behaviors are interrogated when they seek justice. I hope that Jane and Dumas get justice in their next trial. If there are discrepancies in the timeline of events, as the court documents suggest, let them be explored. After an outcry, Judge McFadden recused himself from the retrial, which seems like a good decision. But as the next trial unfolds, do not focus on Jane because she is a woman with Down syndrome. Focus on Jane because she is a woman who says that she was raped. Focus on Jane because she's joined the ranks of other women, women of all races, classes, sexual orientations, and levels of ability who have said that they were raped and then had their testimony disregarded by a judge on the basis of not acting enough like a victim. There is no one correct way to respond to being violated, but there are so many ways that our justice system can make it worse. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Perry.","Judge reversed rape verdict, saying woman didn't act like a victim, man didn't act like rapist .

"(CNN) -- The defense for Oscar Pistorius used the final day of closing arguments in a South African courtroom Friday to painstakingly go through a time line of the night he killed his girlfriend, revisiting phone records and witness testimony to back his version of events. The second and last day of closing arguments caps months of proceedings that have seen the Olympic sprinter gag, vomit and break down in heaving sobs. The judge will consider her verdict over the next five weeks and announce it next month, she said. Pistorius sent a message to supporters through his Twitter account at the end of court Friday: ""Thank you to my loved ones and those that have been there for me, who have picked me up and helped me through everything. "" Pistorius shot his girlfriend, model and law graduate Reeva Steenkamp, on Valentine's Day last year. The state has charged Pistorius, 27, with premeditated murder in the death of Steenkamp, 29. But the athlete contends he mistook her for an intruder when he fired four fatal shots through a locked bathroom door at his home in South Africa. Live blog: Follow the trial . CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said she was impressed with the way defense attorney Barry Roux completed his closing arguments. ""We've always said they'd need to come out with their 'A' game, and that is certainly what they did here today,"" Phelps said. Roux alleged the prosecution made mistakes and handled evidence poorly. He laid out details of the noises from that night: the gunshots, screams and pounding -- the last from Pistorius' using a cricket bat to break down the door. Witness testimony shows an anxious man screamed for help three times, which supports Pistorius' case, according to Roux. The defense reminded the court that Pistorius, who uses prostheses to walk after his lower legs were amputated as a child, suffers from anxiety. Roux compared the Olympian's situation to that of an abuse victim who suddenly snaps after undergoing suffering for a while. Roux argued that Pistorius should be evaluated as a ""reasonable"" disabled person with anxiety, not as an ordinary ""reasonable man."" If the court finds that Postorius was ""reasonable,"" then he must be acquitted, he said. In an attempt to discredit the prosecution's version of events, Roux also accused investigators of tampering with the crime scene by moving items around, including a fan and Steenkamp's jeans. In police pictures, the items appeared in different spots from where the Olympian said they'd been, Roux said. He pointed out that the burden of proof is on the state in this case, and accused the state of avoiding certain important facts and ignoring other reasonable scenarios. Roux pointed out that the burden of proof is on the state in this case, and accused the state of avoiding certain important facts and ignoring other reasonable scenarios. Making his final arguments, prosecutor Gerrie Nel accused the Olympian's attorneys of presenting a defense that did not jibe with the facts. Prosecution: Pistorius lied . Nel, renowned for his bulldog tenacity in questioning, maintained that Pistorius was dishonest and his testimony was ""devoid of any truth."" Using a metaphor reflecting Pistorius' career on the track, Nel said the athlete had ""dropped the baton of truth."" ""Without the baton of truth, you cannot complete the race,"" he said. Nel said the Olympian ""displayed a blatant disregard for the law and the lives of others."" In Pistorius' version of events, the prosecutor said, the athlete said he went to the bathroom door and fired with the intention to kill or hit, believing there was someone behind it. Before he fired, he was armed with a high-powered weapon and was ""in charge"" of the situation, Nel said. He said Pistorius should not go free regardless of whether the court believes he thought there was an intruder behind the door. Calling the Olympic sprinter an ""appalling"" witness, Nel said the evidence from the bullet holes in the bathroom door suggests Pistorius had time to think, and that he looked down the gun sight as he fired. But Roux referenced Nel's metaphors in disputing the accusations. ""There's no crumbling of the mosaic [Nel's metaphor for the defense's circumstantial evidence] or dropping of the baton,"" he said. Judge's decision . The closing arguments lower the curtain on a courtroom drama that, since March, has seen the Olympic sprinter weep and retch in the courtroom as disturbing evidence was presented. Proceedings were delayed while Pistorius underwent a court-ordered, monthlong psychiatric evaluation. He was depressed, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and is a suicide risk, the doctors concluded. But he did not appear to have a history of abnormal aggression or psychopathic tendencies linked to ""rage-type murders in intimate relations."" Nicknamed ""Blade Runner"" for the bladelike lower-leg prostheses he wears on the track, Pistorius has always admitted that he killed Steenkamp. The key question in his trial is that of intent. Judge Thokozile Masipa said Friday that she would announce his fate on September 11. There are no jury trials in South Africa. Masipa is assisted by two lay advisers -- called assessors -- in her decision. The judge's options on verdict and sentencing range from acquittal and freedom to conviction of premeditated murder and life in prison. Masipa and the assessors will consider the evidence and testimony presented in court, which may cover up to 4,000 pages of court transcripts. If the judge believes beyond a reasonable doubt that Pistorius knew he was shooting at Steenkamp, then she will find him guilty of murder. If she rules it was premeditated, Pistorius would face a life sentence. In South Africa, he would be required to serve at least 25 years. If it is not premeditated, he would serve a minimum of 15 years. If Masipa sees any reasonable doubt that Pistorius knew Steenkamp was behind the bathroom door, she won't convict him of murder. Still, if she determines that Pistorius was unreasonable in his actions that led to Steenkamp's killing, she would find him guilty of culpable homicide. In that case, she would have to decide upon a sentence herself. If she believes there is a reasonable chance that Pistorius made a mistake and responded in a reasonable fashion, she will find him not guilty, which means the athlete could go free.

"(CNN) -- Viviette Applewhite, a 93-year-old African-American woman from Philadelphia, suddenly cannot vote. Although she once marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. for the right to do so, and has dutifully cast a ballot for five decades, in this election year she may be denied this basic right. Under Pennsylvania's new voter ID law, Applewhite is no longer considered eligible. The Pennsylvania law requires that citizens present a state-issued photo ID card before voting, which, in Applewhite's case, required that she first produce a birth certificate. After much trying, and with the help of a pro bono attorney, she was finally able to obtain her birth certificate -- but on it, she is identified by her birth name Brooks, while her other forms of identification have her as Applewhite, the name she took after adoption. Because her 1950s adoption papers are lost in an office in Mississippi, and the state is unable to track them down, Applewhite still can't get a Pennsylvania photo ID. She is therefore barred from voting in the November elections. Such stringent obstacles, particularly for African-Americans, were not so long ago the accepted rule. Despite the 15th and 19th amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which extended the vote to black men and all women, respectively, election officials used poll taxes, literacy tests and other methods to deny this legal right. Then came the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson 47 years ago Monday, the Voting Rights Act empowered the federal government to oversee elections in states with racially discriminatory voting practices, and outlawed the use of literacy tests for all American voters. The landmark legislation not only broadened the franchise to African-Americans, it opened access to poor whites and others who had also been denied their right to participate in the electoral process. These major social changes were hard-fought. Without protests by citizens who willingly confronted hatred and intimidation from furious mobs, as well as assault from billy clubs and fire hoses, it's doubtful that the Voting Rights Act would have ever passed. Yet as we commemorate the anniversary, we must also remember that the fight to protect our vote continues. Across the country, efforts to suppress the turnout and registration of minority voters wage on, making that fight as urgent today as it was in the era of literacy tests and poll taxes. Driven by nearly all Republican legislatures (Rhode Island, which has a Democratic-controlled legislature, is the lone exception), last year 34 states introduced voter ID laws with similar requirements, creating barriers for the 11% of voting-age Americans who lack state-issued photo IDs. These laws disproportionately affect minorities, the poor, senior citizens and the young. Of the more than 21 million Americans without the newly required photo identification, 25% are African-American, 15% earn less than $35,000 a year, 18% are 65 or older, and 20% are 18 to 29. Not so coincidentally, these groups turned out in huge numbers, largely voting Democratic, in 2008. Voter ID laws, however, are just one arm of a systemic attempt to curb the participation of certain voters. In some of these same states, including Alabama, Kansas, Tennessee and Florida, legislatures have also passed laws that demand proof of citizenship to register to vote (a tough deal if you don't happen to walk around with a birth certificate, passport or naturalization records in your pocket) or that reduce early voting. This includes the elimination of the Sunday before Election Day when many black churches hold successful ""Take Your Souls to the Polls"" campaigns encouraging their congregants to vote. Still more brazen tactics, as seen in campaigns mounted in Colorado, Florida and New Mexico, would summarily purge thousands of registered voters, whom state officials suspect might not be citizens, from the voter rolls. These measures were supposedly enacted to prevent voter fraud, but any serious examination of voter fraud reveals that there is almost none. A five-year investigation by the Bush Justice Department concluded that incidents of voter fraud are exceedingly rare, and Pennsylvania officials have admitted that there is no in-person voter fraud in the state, not a single case that has ever been found or documented. Rooting out such a small number of prospective fraudulent voters simply does not call for the extreme measures that shut out millions of legitimate ones. At best, these laws are scaring off a few tree bugs by burning down a 10th of the forest. The real purpose behind these restrictive voting laws is not to prevent voter fraud, but to prevent voting in the interest of partisan gain. Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Mike Turzai even said as much in June, when he boasted to his Republican colleagues that the state's voter ID law ""is going to allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania."" No matter which side of the aisle you're on, we can all agree that denying anyone's vote to skew the electorate undermines our shared American values of fairness and equality. Just like poll taxes and literacy tests before them, these laws are also keeping targeted groups of people from having a voice in their government. But what we can learn from these similar struggles is that social progress, such as the passage of the Voting Rights Acts, did not just happen naturally, an inevitable result of the passing years. It happened because citizens, activists, lawbreakers and lawmakers acted to change their society. But that action -- or even the mere recognition that blocking equal access to voting is a civil rights emergency -- is lacking now. It's wrong to believe that these struggles ended and are reserved now for history lessons and textbooks. Tomorrow's history is being written today, and we can all help shape the narrative. In a country whose fundamental values are equality and freedom, we must always examine times when our freedoms are being violated. That means realizing that voter ID laws such as the one blocking the vote of Viviette Applewhite are not minor bumps on the road. Rather, they hit at the most central element of American democracy. As we reflect on the strides made 47 years ago, we remind our fellow citizens that each victory is taken, not given. And as we confront the modern-day era of voter suppression, it's time that we all start protecting the free, fair and accessible vote that defines the greatness of our nation.

"Washington (CNN) -- On one side were pegboard panels mounted with various assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons -- including a Bushmaster similar to the one used in last month's Newtown school massacre. Behind the stage stood police officers supporting a renewed ban on such firepower. One by one, victims of gun violence told their brief stories and expressed support for a new federal ban being proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein on some assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons. Almost six weeks after the Connecticut shooting rampage that killed 20 first graders, Feinstein said she planned to introduce her measure later Thursday, with Reps. Carolyn McCarthy of New York and Ed Perlmutter of Colorado doing the same in the House. What's in Feinstein's gun bill? Feinstein's proposal would upgrade an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 and also outlaw ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. She said the goal is to ""dry up the supply of these weapons over time."" ""These massacres don't seem to stop,"" the California Democrat lamented, listing notorious rampages of past years known by the lone name of their locations -- Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Tucson and Oak Creek. ""We should be outraged at how easy it is"" for attackers to get hold of the semi-automatic weapons or large-capacity magazines used in those slaughters, Feinstein told the event at the U.S. Capitol that she organized. Sandy Hook probe to extend until summer . Her legislation is opposed by the nation's powerful gun lobby, led by the National Rifle Association. That means that despite a push by the White House and Democrats for tougher gun control steps, Feinstein's full measure is given little chance of winning congressional approval. In a statement on Thursday, the NRA said that Feinstein ""has been trying to ban guns from law-abiding citizens for decades."" ""The American people know gun bans do not work and we are confident Congress will reject Senator Feinstein's wrong-headed approach,"" the organization added. In a sign of the gun lobby's influence, a nine-day sports and outdoor show scheduled to take place in Pennsylvania next month was postponed Thursday because the NRA withdrew its support over the decision by organizers to ban the display of ""modern sporting rifles"" -- the kind of semi-automatic weapons targeted by Feinstein's proposal. At her Washington event, Feinstein acknowledged that enacting a ban was ""really an uphill road,"" adding: ""If anyone asks if we can win this, the answer is we don't know, because it's really uphill."" She then made a plea for people to call their senators and House members to declare ""enough is enough,"" adding that a mobilized public is ""stronger than the gun lobby."" Later Thursday, Vice President Joe Biden made a similar appeal in an online discussion on Google, saying: ""Make your voices heard."" He insisted that a reasonable ban on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as strengthening background checks, presented no threat to the constitutional right to bear arms. ""It's not about keeping bad guns out of the hands of good people,"" Biden said. ""It's about keeping all guns out of the hands of bad people."" President Barack Obama called for renewing the assault weapons ban as part of his package of gun control proposals announced earlier this month in response to the December 14 Newtown school massacre and overall gun violence in America. Marine to senator: 'No ma'am,' I won't register my guns . Feinstein's measure would stop the sale, transfer, importation and manufacture of more than 100 specialty firearms and certain semi-automatic rifles, as well as limiting magazines to 10 rounds or less, she said. Not all of the weapons in the bill meet the technical definition of assault weapons. The restrictions would not apply to guns owned before enactment of any law. Feinstein noted her proposal exempts from the ban more than 2,000 models used for hunting or sporting purposes. ""They are by make and model exempted from the legislation,"" she said, adding that the old ban had 375 such exemptions. Those exemptions were an apparent effort to garner support for the measure from conservative Democrats and others expected to face fierce lobbying by the NRA and constituents. Supporters of more gun control acknowledge the constitutional right to bear arms, but argue that rifles capable of firing multiple rounds automatically or semi-automatically exceed the reasonable needs of hunters and other gun enthusiasts. They also contend that high-capacity ammunition magazines provide the capability for mass shootings such as the Newtown massacre. Opponents contend the Second Amendment forbids the government from this type of limit on weapon ownership by citizens. They worry that such a weakening of gun rights would signal a shift that would leave citizens defenseless against criminals and, some also argue, against potential future government tyranny or abuse. Instead, the NRA has called for increasing armed guards at schools to protect students. Speakers at the event organized by Feinstein rejected arguments that anyone beyond the military or law enforcement officers needed such firepower. ""How are you going to hunting with something like that?"" asked Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, pointing to the assault weapons displayed to his left. ""You kill something, there's nothing left to eat."" With new Congress comes a new push for gun laws . Continuing bloodshed on the nation's streets -- with dozens dying every day from gun violence -- should be enough evidence to overcome the past inability to get gun control legislation enacted, he argued. ""If the slaughter of 20 babies does not capture and hold your attention, then I give up because I don't know what else will,"" Ramsey continued, thrusting a pointed finger for emphasis. At Feinstein's request, people who were injured or lost loved ones to gun violence, including several from the Virginia Tech massacre, then offered their support for her efforts. Some told of losing a parent or child. Others described how attackers inflicted carnage so quickly. Pam Simon, a staff member to Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, said she was a few feet away from the congresswoman on the day both were shot outside a Tucson grocery store. ""On that day, 30 bullets were delivered in less than 30 seconds,"" Simon said. NRA chief: Obama makes 'mockery' of American freedoms . Some of the weapons on display Thursday are currently against the law in the District of Columbia, and Democratic sources told CNN that Feinstein coordinated with police on being able to have the guns there. NBC's David Gregory was recently investigated for holding a banned ammunition magazine on the network's ""Meet the Press"" program broadcast from Washington. No charges were brought in that case. Obama's proposals include expanding and strengthening background checks on gun buyers to ensure all sales include screening to prevent weapons from going to criminals and the mentally ill. While the gun lobby has indicated support for some improvements in background checks, it remains opposed to other steps, saying they won't prevent criminals from getting weapons. Instead, gun advocates urge tougher enforcement of existing laws and making criminals serve their full sentences. Biden led a panel assembled by Obama in December to examine gun control steps after the Newtown shootings, which sparked a fierce public debate over how to prevent such mass killings. Biden's recommendations formed the basis of the package of proposals Obama announced this month. A recent CNN/Time Magazine/ORC International poll indicated that Americans generally favor stricter gun control, but they don't believe that stricter gun laws alone would reduce gun violence. In announcing his gun control package, Obama also signed executive actions that call for tougher enforcement of existing laws and require federal agencies to provide data for background checks. New York state recently enacted a series of new gun regulations, the nation's first since the Newtown shootings. Ten other states are reviewing some form of related action. The issue is among the most politically divisive in the country, as demonstrated by the decision by Reed Exhibitions to postpone the nine-day Eastern Sport and Outdoor Show scheduled to start February 2 in Harrisburg. On Tuesday, the NRA withdrew its support for the show due to the decision by organizers to ban modern sporting rifles from exhibition. ""We had called on Reed Exhibitions to reconsider their decision; unfortunately they have steadfastly refused to do so,"" an NRA statement said. ""As a result, the NRA will not be participating in the upcoming show in Harrisburg or in any other shows hosted by Reed Exhibitions that maintain this policy."" In announcing Thursday that the show was off, a Reed Exhibitions official said the intent of excluding ""certain products"" was to focus on hunting and fishing traditions of the event. ""It has become very clear to us after speaking with our customers that the event could not be held because the atmosphere of this year's show would not be conducive to an event that is designed to provide family enjoyment,"" said Chet Burchett, the company's president for the Americas. ""It is unfortunate that in the current emotionally charged atmosphere this celebratory event has become overshadowed by a decision that directly affected a small percentage of more than 1,000 exhibits showcasing products and services for those interested in hunting and fishing,"" he added. CNN's Halimah Abdullah, Kevin Bohn and Todd Sperry contributed to this report.","NEW: Vice President Biden takes part in an online discussion on gun violence .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- In her first visit to South by Southwest Interactive, the tech-themed conference underway here, former first daughter Chelsea Clinton devoted the bulk of her prepared talk Tuesday to the admirable work of her family's foundation in improving global health care. But it was her more personal remarks, often about her famous family's early use of technology, that seemed to resonate most. ""I definitely taught my parents how to text and how to charge their phones,"" she told almost 3,000 people in an Austin convention hall. ""I'm sure that's not uncommon for many people in this room."" Clinton, 34, said she got her first computer, a Commodore, ""from Santa Claus"" as a child and sent her first e-mail while in high school in the mid-1990s. That was around the time her father, then-President Bill Clinton, sent the first presidential e-mail, to astronaut John Glenn in space -- a fact she said her dad was ""ridiculously"" proud of. ""He's now a pretty good tweeter and a pretty good texter, but he's still only sent about two e-mails,"" she said. She then joked about how her father is not the most famous texter in the family and showed the photo of her mother, wearing sunglasses and wielding a phone, that inspired the ""Texts From Hillary"" meme. Wearing jeans and a black jacket, Clinton gave a rather stiff, scripted 25-minute speech, followed by a more relaxed Q&A session with Fast Company editor Robert Safian. She showed glimmers of both her mother's poise and her father's command of detail, rattling off stats about mobile banking usage in Kenya and the 750,000 children in the world who die each year from dehydration caused by diarrhea. ""I'm obsessed with diarrhea,"" she said. ""It doesn't make me squeamish."" As the only child of two ambitious parents, growing up in the spotlight of the Arkansas governor's mansion and the White House, Clinton said a lot was expected of her at a young age. At age 6 she said she would debate her parents, one at a time, about issues or current events while the other parent moderated. ""It taught me that not only was it OK to have an opinion and a point of view,"" she said, ""it was expected that I would have an opinion and a point of view."" Asked for the umpteenth time about whether she'll enter politics, Clinton demurred, although she left the door open at least a crack. ""I don't know,"" she said, adding, ""For a long time, my answer to that question was no."" She expressed dismay that none of her friends -- most of them smart, accomplished people -- show any interest in running for office. ""I find that really troubling,"" she said, adding that when her father graduated from Georgetown University in the 1960s, he said about half his classmates were pondering a future in politics. Clinton did urge the coders, designers and other tech professionals in the audience to devote their careers to making the world a better place. Tech entrepreneurs can sometimes find quicker solutions to global problems than policy makers, she said. Asked for her advice to SXSW attendees pondering careers in social good, she offered this: . ""I'd focus on what you're most passionate about and what makes you angry. I'd ask myself, 'What do I think is really unjust?' That should be a starting point for how you engage with the world.""","Chelsea Clinton speaks Tuesday at South by Southwest Interactive conference .

"(CNN) -- In her first television interview since she was freed following an alleged kidnapping this month, Hannah Anderson described herself as a survivor, and thanked those who have supported her. ""In the beginning I was a victim, but now knowing everyone out there is helping me, I consider myself a survivor instead,"" she told NBC News. ""My mom raised me to be strong."" James DiMaggio allegedly kidnapped Hannah on August 4. Police later found the bodies of her mother and brother at DiMaggio's burned home, about an hour east of San Diego. After evading authorities for a week, DiMaggio was spotted in the Idaho wilderness on August 10, nearly 1,000 miles from where the alleged kidnapping occurred. An FBI agent shot him dead and Hannah, 16, was returned to her family in Southern California. In the interview, portions of which NBC aired Thursday morning, Hannah addressed rampant speculation online about text messages and letters she exchanged with DiMaggio. The two texted the day she was abducted because he was supposed to pick her up from cheerleading camp and he needed directions, she said. Earlier letters involved advice about her relationship with her mother, the teen told NBC. ""They weren't anything bad, they were just to help me through tough times,"" she told ""Today."" She also thanked law enforcement officials and others involved in her rescue. She singled out the horseback riders who first spotted her in the Idaho wilderness. ""I'd like to say thank you, because without them I probably wouldn't be here right now,"" she said. DiMaggio family requests DNA samples for Anderson, her brother . 'Rumors that Jim might be the father' Since her return, a series of twists have emerged, including a request by DiMaggio's family that DNA testing be conducted on Hannah and her 8-year-old brother, whose body was found in the alleged kidnapper's torched home. ""We are going to be requesting from the Anderson family that we try to get DNA samples from Hannah. And if they have anything left from Ethan, that we get a DNA sample,"" DiMaggio's family spokesman, Andrew Spanswick, told CNN affiliate KGTV. ""There has been a lot of rumors that Jim might be the father of either or both children."" A representative for the Anderson family shot down the theory. ""Brett and Tina Anderson did not meet Mr. DiMaggio until the sixth month of Tina's pregnancy with Hannah. Brett Anderson's DNA was used to identify the body of his dead son Ethan Anderson,"" the family statement said. And David Braun, Tina Anderson's uncle, reacted angrily to the idea. ""I would tell them to shut up with their accusations and their implications up until after the funeral, until after my precious Tina and precious Ethan are buried -- the family members that your family murdered,"" Braun said. ""That's what I would tell them."" Mother, brother laid to rest . A complex case . With each passing day, the case has taken on added complexity. DiMaggio, 40, left a life insurance policy that named Hannah and Ethan's grandmother, Bernice Anderson, as the beneficiary. Stacy Hess, the Anderson family spokeswoman, did not know the dollar amount, but other media outlets put it at around $110,000. The insurance policy was one of the reasons DiMaggio's family sought a DNA test. ""We find it very strange that he has left all this money without any explanation. It states specifically that he didn't want to give it to either parent cause he didn't trust them,"" spokesman Spanswick said, referring to Hannah's parents. The Anderson children called DiMaggio ""Uncle Jim."" One search warrant referred to Hannah's mother as the wife of DiMaggio's best friend. Anderson letters found at kidnap suspect's home . Hannah spotted with captor . Hannah was seen with DiMaggio in his car about 20 hours before he allegedly set fire to his house, police said. The two were in his blue Nissan Versa just after midnight August 4, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said. They were spotted at a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint, according to Jan Caldwell, a spokeswoman for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. Caldwell did not say what the two were doing together or whether Hannah was with DiMaggio voluntarily. CNN was unable to get an Anderson family response to this revelation. Search warrant raises eyebrows . Phone records indicate the two ""called each other approximately 13 times"" shortly before both their phones were turned off on August 4, a search warrant revealed. The same document says that a fire was reported later that night at DiMaggio's two-story log cabin and a detached garage in Boulevard, California. After battling the fire, authorities found the bodies of Hannah's mother and brother. An affidavit claimed that both had been ""tortured and killed"" by DiMaggio, who then set his home and garage ablaze. Affidavits: Mother, brother 'tortured and killed' San Diego County deputies searching DiMaggio's charred home also found a handwritten note, handcuff box, camping equipment, a DNA swab kit, two used condoms and letters from Hannah, according to an affidavit. Contents of the letters and the handwritten note were not revealed.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Thousands of mourners gathered Thursday for the second mass funeral in two days after a 22-year-old Turkish man died from a gunshot wound. Crowds carrying Turkish flags escorted the coffin of Burak Can Karamanoglu through the streets of Istanbul. His death Wednesday increased tensions in a country riven by deep political polarization in the run-up to municipal elections scheduled to take place nationwide on March 30. The Istanbul governor's office issued a statement explaining that Wednesday night, Karamanoglu ""lost his life as a result of a verbal argument between two groups that escalated into a fight where a gun was used."" Two other men received gunshot wounds, the governor's office said. Neither of the wounded was in critical condition. It is not clear which groups were involved in the fight that led to Karamanoglu's death. But the violence took place amid clashes in nearby streets between riot police and mourners who had attended the funeral of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan on Wednesday. Berkin died in an Istanbul hospital this week, nine months after he was critically wounded, apparently by a tear gas canister fired by riot police. The boy's death triggered a massive outpouring of grief and discontent, as demonstrators in several Turkish cities blamed the death on the Turkish government and excessive police force. After burying his son, Berkin's father took to the airwaves to denounce Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ""I am addressing the Prime Minister. If he wants, he could bring the murderer of my child to me in one hour,"" Sami Elvan told CNN sister network CNN Turk. He went on to criticize Erdogan for refusing to discuss the death of his son or of six Turkish men who have died since anti-government protests erupted in May 2013. In a worrying sign of growing political tension, the father of Karamanoglu -- this week's gunshot victim -- lashed out at the crowds of mourners who clashed with police after Berkin's funeral. ""There wasn't a place, a storefront they didn't damage. They burned and destroyed everything,"" said Halil Karamanoglu, in comments published by the state broadcaster TRT. ""I am hurting right now. Take pity on this nation, take pity on these children. Common sense ... we have to be united,"" he said. Turkey's Prime Minister has not discussed Berkin's death in lengthy television interviews and at daily political rallies. But at a public appearance Thursday, Erdogan drew attention to Karamanoglu's shooting death. He blamed the killing on the protesters who criticize his government. ""Yesterday, unfortunately, they killed a youth that had just returned from military service. What are the people expressing sorrow yesterday going to say about this child of ours?"" Erdogan said, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency.","The death of Burak Can Karamanoglu follows Tuesday death of Berkin Elvan, 15 .

"(CNN) -- Here's what we do know about next week: Bill and Hillary Clinton will kick off the annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in New York on September 21. Here's what we don't know: will they be grandparents yet? Why are we asking right now? America first learned that Chelsea was pregnant while she shared the stage with her mother during a women's event in New York back in April. The former first family has not disclosed the due date. But if you assume she waited the standard three months to share her news ... three plus April, May, June, July, August ... that makes September the ninth month. Plus, when she was speaking at another women's event in Washington on Friday, Hillary Clinton tried to excite Democrats about voting in November with this pitch: . ""Now I've been thinking a lot about family because you know I'm on 'grandbaby watch' and I think a lot about this new member of our family and what he or she can look forward to,"" she said. ""And I am well aware that we will do everything possible to prepare this child, to protect this child. But I want that for everybody's child and everybody's grandchild. I want every one of our children to feel that they are inheriting the best of America, that they have the chance to do what I believed was possible for me and what my husband believed was possible for him and what we instilled in our daughter that really this country is on your side. ""This country will give you the fighting chance, the fair show you deserves to have. This country will give you the level playing field. So whether you're the grandchild of a president, or the grandchild of a janitor, whether you're born in a city or in a small rural village -- No matter who you are, you have the right to inherit the American dream."" On September 8, Bill Clinton was on stage and interrupted an appearance he was making with former President George W. Bush to answer a phone that was in his pocket. His eyes got big when he looked at the caller ID and he said, ""Only two people in the world have this number and they're both related to me. I hope I'm not being told I'm about to be made a premature grandfather."" But that wasn't the call. He and W. Bush went on to discuss grandfatherhood. It was cute. ""Get ready also to be, like, the lowest person in the pecking order in your family,"" Bush told Clinton. Chelsea Clinton also recently alluded to the advanced stage of her pregnancy during an interview with the online magazine Refinery29 -- she was plugging a new line of clothes meant to raise awareness about endangered elephants -- where she talked about her own current clothing choices. ""You're asking someone who is very pregnant. In the here and now, [I wear] anything that fits over my belly. Increasingly, that's my husband's T-shirts or button-down shirts,"" she said. ""So, the honest answer in the here and now is a different answer than it would be had you asked me a few months ago, or ask me again in nine months. But, for right now, it's really my husband's shirts, because they're the only things that fit me."" So we know Chelsea is squarely in the hot zone. But we don't know much else. Including: . Is it a boy or a girl? We don't know. Where will the Clinton baby be delivered? We don't know. But here are some potential clues: When Hillary Clinton was treated for a blood clot in 2013, she went to New York Presbyterian on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. When former president Bill Clinton underwent heart surgery ten years ago, he went to New York Presbyterian Hospital, too. How will the nursery be decorated? We don't know, but in that recent interview on the fashion blog, Chelsea Clinton suggested there could be an elephant theme. What will the baby be named? We don't know. But here are some suggestions: . First, if it's a boy, maybe consider pulling a name from one of the 44 presidents. William could be an obvious choice. It was in the top five of new baby names, according to the Social Security Administration's annual survey. But what about Theodore or Franklin? Those are strong names for Democrats. Probably not Barack, after that 2008 primary. If it's a girl, the name Mila is off the table, since that's what Jenna Bush named her daughter back in 2013. There aren't any former presidents after which to name her. At least not yet. Ahem, Grandma.","Chelsea Clinton first announced she was pregnant in April, due date could be this month .

"(EW.com) -- Who was the last male monarch who had not previously been Prince of Wales? Don't know the answer off the top of your head? Neither did Arthur Chu, who ended his 11-game winning streak on Jeopardy! Wednesday night when he incorrectly answered the final question of the night. Chu lost to Diana Peloquin, someone who the controversial Jeopardy! star calls ""a bit devious"" (in a good way). We caught up with him over the phone to see how he's feeling, who his favorite movie villain is, and who he took some selfies with before heading back home to Ohio. What happened [Wednesday] night? Well, I lost. I think Alex Trebek actually pointed it out; he saw how I was feeling that day. I was really fatigued, and I was sort of losing my mojo. And Diana, to her credit, picked up on the strategy I was using, and she used it herself to great effect. You said she picked up on your strategy â€” was she the first competitor to do that? Other people tried to do it, but I think some people weren't prepared to play in a way different than they'd practiced. Diana had the advantage that she watched me for a whole day before having to play because she was an alternate the day before, and so she had that time to prepare and she's also a little bit devious. She's a very clever person, I hope she does well in her future games. You have this title as a Jeopardy! villain, do you remember the first time you saw a mention of that in media? There was someone who wrote a tweet, I think they were being tongue-in-cheek, they posted a picture of my face and were like, 'This is the face of a Jeopardy! villain, can anyone stop him?' And that meme sort of ran out of control. EW: 'Jeopardy!' champ Arthur Chu's winning streak ends -- VIDEO . You've humorously embraced that title of villain. Did it get to you at first, or was your initial reaction, ""oh, that's funny""? It's really more of an antihero thing. People are saying, antiheroes are big now, people say I'm the Walter White of Jeopardy!, or like I was Moneyballing Jeopardy!. It was something that made Jeopardy! different for a while and I think a lot of people appreciated that. There was this awesome video by these Taiwanese animators that shows me as literally a super villain with super powers. I loved that. I said, that justifies this whole media thing by itself. If you could be any TV or movie villain, who would you be? I always sympathize with Syndrome in The Incredibles because it totally was like, if you don't have super powers, why not use your brain to try to figure out a way to give yourself super powers? I don't see why that's a bad thing. Ken Jennings might have just been much naturally better than me at Jeopardy!, but shouldn't we be encouraging people that if you don't necessarily have the natural talents to exceed at something without trying, than succeed at it by trying. So the fact that The Incredibles showed the bad guy Syndrome as evil because he wanted to give everyone the chance to have super powers, that never sat well with me. I see it from the other perspective: If you can use your brain, and figure out inventions or tricks to compensate for your natural disadvantages, that's what science is about, that's what progress is about. So do you have any natural talents? [LAUGHS] There's no way to get money in Jeopardy! without knowing the answers to questions. But it's just like any other sport. It's not just about athletics, it's about the playbook. Everyone who plays in the NFL is good enough to play in the NFL for the most part, and then it comes down to which team was better coached, which team had the better strategy going into the game, which team used their resources most effectively. And I don't see a game show as being any different. Who could you tell about your winning streak after the taping? I ended up telling my family over Christmas, because I had to explain why I could afford to buy my brother a TV. [LAUGHS] A lot of my friends said they were sure that I'd lost on my first episode; they said they were sure the way I was promoting it, like telling everybody to come watch it with me, like, 'that must have been his only game, he must want people to support him.' [LAUGHS] . EW: Public service announcement: It's time to cram for the 'Jeopardy!' online test . What category would you ace, no question? [LAUGHS] A category on, let's see, text adventure computer games from the 1980s. I would smoke that category. That's something I know way too much about compared to how important it is in life, but that's one of my expert categories. What entertainment are you into, what are you watching? My wife and I really liked Orange is the New Black, we really liked Alpha House on Amazon, and Betas, also on Amazon. Actually, one of the best things about Betas is this quote, where there's a character named David Chu, and he says this awesome thing that I wish I'd thought of it earlier. But this would be my quote for people who don't like watching me play on Jeopardy!: 'That sounds like a 'you' problem, like a Chu problem.' So that's my tagline. Do you talk to Diana? I messaged her on Monday, saying, 'are you ready for what the media is going to do to you on Wednseday?' because I hadn't anticipated the story about me would blow up so big. And she was like, 'No, I have no idea what to do! I'm freaking out!' And I was like, 'you'll be fine.' [LAUGHS] What was really cool was that I happened to run into her mom and her best friend in the airport when I was going to fly back to Ohio after the taping and they actually, they had nothing but good things to say. We took some selfies and everything and it was cool. So how are you feeling? Obviously, I wish I had gone on to be Ken Jennings. But we can't all be Ken Jennings. In fact, the evidence suggests most of us can't be Ken Jennings. I don't know how he did it. I like to think I'm the best mere mortal in Jeopardy!. There's Dave Madden, then there is Ken Jennings, who isn't human. It's like if we were doing basketball rankings, I'd be the best normal basketball player in history and then you'd have Michael Jordan and you know, Ken Jennings would be like, God or something. You're like the the Jeopardy! champion of the people, basically. Yeah, yeah. I've had people say that. They're like, Ken Jennings seemed like he wasn't trying, it seemed like it was easy for him. Whereas for you, this guy was saying to me, for you it seemed like you struggled a lot. So it was much more human, it made me feel like I could do that. And I was like, that's the message I want to send to people. See the original story at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- Say this for Twitter: They may not always know what their users want, but once they learn what their users don't want, they fix it in a hurry. On Thursday, the social site tweaked the way users block others who harass, spam or otherwise bother them. Under the change the blocked user would still be able to see the profile and tweets of the other user, as well as retweet their posts. By Thursday night, however, the change was gone, reversed in stunningly abrupt fashion after a flurry of user protests, on a platform perfectly suited for both flurries and protests. Here's a look at how, and why, it all went down. The timeline . Users began noticing the update to Twitter's blocking policy Thursday morning. Tech blogs and other media outlets began reporting the change, as well as the swell of protests against it. Twitter's top brass reportedly huddled up as the dissent mounted. And, at 10:44 p.m. ET, the company announced in a tweet that it had reversed course and the old rules would apply once again. What was Twitter thinking? The idea behind the original change was actually an effort to protect users from harassment. In his blog post, Twitter vice president Michael Sippy noted that under the old, and now restored, system, a user can tell when someone else has blocked them. ""We believe this is not ideal, largely due to the retaliation against blocking users by blocked users (and sometimes their friends) that often occurs,"" he wrote. ""Some users worry just as much about post-blocking retaliation as they do about pre-blocking abuse."" He said Twitter will continue trying to find a way to fix that problem. The backlash . Nothing's unanimous on a site with more than 200 million registered users. But it became really clear, really fast that lots of folks on Twitter didn't consider the change a move in the right direction. One petition on Change.org called the new system a ""nightmare."" ""This is a huge and very serious problem for people, like me, who have received repeated rape and death threats on Twitter on a fairly consistent basis,"" wrote Zerlina Maxwell, a political consultant and writer for Ebony magazine, who started the petition. ""I utilize the Block button almost every day and while that is not a perfect solution -- because users can simply log out to view your timeline even if you have blocked them -- it at least forbid harassers from following you and at worst retweeting you into their feed, which can simply allow their followers to also harass you."" The tweets, of course, poured in, too. ""If I understand the new @twitter block correctly, my curtains have just been replaced with a one-way mirror. Looking *in*,"" one user wrote. The reversal . In the late-evening blog post, Sippy said Twitter had listened to its users. ""We never want to introduce features at the cost of users feeling less safe,"" he wrote. He said Twitter will continue working on ways to let users express themselves freely while still making them feel safe. ""We've been working diligently to strike this balance since Twitter's inception, and we thank you for all of your support and feedback to date. Thank you in advance for your patience as we continue to build the best -- and safest -- Twitter we possibly can."" How unusual was this turnaround? It's rare, but not unheard of, for major tech company websites to reverse course on policy changes. In October, Facebook briefly lifted a ban on at least some violent content (a video of a woman being beheaded was the most prominent). The logic was that people use the site to raise awareness about important issues and, sometimes, that involves showing scenes of violence. But a day later Facebook appeared to have reversed itself, with reinstated videos once again disappearing from the network. Last December, Instagram's terms of service were tweaked with language that appeared to give the company ownership of users' photographs. ""The language we proposed ... raised questions about whether your photos can be part of an advertisement,"" Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom wrote in a blog post. ""We do not have plans for anything like this and because of that we're going to remove the language that raised the question."" That change was rolled out on a Monday and reversed by Wednesday. And in 2011, Netflix infamously angered customers when it announced plans to spin off its DVD rental business into a separate subsidiary called Qwikster. After an outcry from customers, who quit in droves, Netflix reversed itself and killed off Qwikster some three weeks later -- an eternity compared with Twitter's about-face Thursday.","A revised Twitter policy for blocking other users only lasted hours .
The change would have let blocked users see and retweet the blocker's posts .
The idea was to not prompt retaliation for a visible block .
Users called the change a nightmare, and Twitter responded ."
"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The mother of Kristi Cornwell, whose remains were discovered nearly a year and a half after she disappeared, said on Monday she is thankful to finally be able to bring her daughter home. ""We didn't want it to end this way, but that's the way it is. And we can bring her home now,"" said Jo Ann Cornwell, fighting back tears. ""I know in my heart she's in heaven and we'll see her again."" She spoke the same day authorities said tests conducted on bones found in Georgia revealed they are Kristi Cornwell's remains. The positive identification was made through dental records, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a statement. Kristi Cornwell, 38, was last seen walking along a road in northern Georgia the night of August 11, 2009. Her brother, acting off a tip from the bureau, found the remains Saturday in a wooded area about 9 miles from where she was last seen. The site where the bones were discovered is in Union County, in far northern Georgia. Investigators believe Cornwell's disappearance could be related to a December 2009 incident in Ranger, North Carolina, in which a woman was attacked by a man driving a late model Nissan Xterra, the GBI said. In April, investigators were led to the home of 42-year-old James Scott Carringer, who was suspected of rape in Gilmer County, Georgia. Carringer, who killed himself as police tried to arrest him on the rape charges, also owned a silver Xterra and was originally from Brasstown, North Carolina, not far from Ranger, the GBI said. Beyond those details, the bureau did not specify why investigators believe the two cases are linked. ""Because we have no direct evidence, this will remain an active and open investigation at GBI. We are still pursuing investigative leads as they relate to Carringer,"" said GBI Director Vernon Keenan. He said investigators were led to the area where Kristi's remains were discovered by cell phone records that indicated Carringer had been nearby the night she disappeared. ""We believe that he was a career criminal and we do not know how much harm he has done,"" said Keenan. Last summer, on the one-year anniversary of Cornwell's disappearance, the GBI said it had conducted interviews at 450 houses in the Union County area, and that its file on the case had grown to 40 volumes. CNN's Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","NEW: The brother of the missing woman finds her remains .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The security video system in Justin Bieber's mansion could be the best witness to the teen pop star's alleged egg attack on a neighbor. ""It was extensive,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. David Thompson said of the system. ""I believe it was installed very well and covered all areas of Mr. Bieber's house. His security system was well operated."" A dozen deputies, armed with a search warrant from a judge, seized the hard drives that hold the security video from last week. Detectives are scouring the video frame-by-frame for clues as to who tossed eggs from Bieber's property onto the house next door in the exclusive Calabasas, California, community last Thursday night, Thompson said. ""It will either prove or disprove, or maybe neither."" If video from that night is missing, detectives will call for help, he said. ""We have a high-tech crew that works on such things, depending on what we find they can tell if it's been deleted, altered or stopped at a certain time or turned off,"" Thompson said. ""If it's 24-hour security video and it doesn't show a particular day, you can make your own conclusions."" While the neighbor who accused Bieber of launching the egg assault does not have a similar video system, TMZ did obtain video of the incident recorded by the accuser. While the attackers can't be seen, they are heard. Detectives could use test that audio to determine whether there's a match to Bieber's voice. Bieber and his representatives have stayed silent about the incident, declining to comment when contacted by CNN. Although the singer spoke to deputies during their search -- telling them who was in the house, for example -- he has not talked to investigators about the felony vandalism allegations, Thompson said. His lawyer would need to be present for that to happen, he said. Justin Bieber's bad year: A guide . Bieber's wake up call . Bieber was asleep when investigators knocked on his door Wednesday morning, Thompson said. The security staff answered and let them in. The warrant allowed deputies to go room by room through the sprawling estate, which is how they busted Lil Za -- real name Xavier Smith -- who was a house guest. They found suspected Ecstasy -- aka Molly -- and Xanax near the 20-year-old rapper's bed, Thompson said. Lil Za was arrested on a felony drug charge. He was later charged with felony vandalism for allegedly busting a jail phone while waiting to be bailed out. Despite all the egg jokes dished out, this is a serious case, Thompson said. The neighbor's house suffered an estimated $20,000 in damage, which makes the alleged vandalism a felony. It could land the offender in jail, but at the every least a long probation term and community service. Add to that the legal bills and time attending court hearings. Deputies at the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station, which serves an affluent section of Los Angeles County just east of Malibu, have become familiar with Bieber, 19, since he moved into a $6.4 million home in The Oaks neighborhood two years ago. Neighbors have dialed 911 several times to complain that the teenage multimillionaire was speeding down their residential streets in his high-performance cars. One neighbor accused Bieber of spitting in his face during a heated confrontation last March. Deputies have responded to complaints about loud parties at Bieber's place. Except for warnings, nothing was done. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office concluded that they couldn't prove the spitting or speeding cases in court, so they declined to prosecute. Prosecutors also rejected a misdemeanor battery complaint from a photographer who accused Bieber of attacking him in the parking lot of a Calabasas shopping center as he was taking photos of Bieber and his then-girlfriend, Selena Gomez, in May 2012. ""We didn't do this search warrant to send a message,"" Thompson said Tuesday. ""That's not what we do, but we hope maybe that understanding the gravity of this will change some of the behavior."" If detectives find evidence that Justin Bieber attacked his neighbor with eggs, they will present their findings to the district attorney for possible prosecution. This could happen in a few days or weeks, Thompson said. Until then, Bieber is free to roam the world, he said. ""I don't feel that he'll flee in any way.""

"(CNN) -- ""Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only,"" Coco Chanel once said. ""Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening"". And what is happening, now that everyone is a smartphone owner, is that fashion and technology, traditionally uncomfortable bedfellows, are coming together like never before. Fashion editors were invited to the launch of the brand new Apple Watch, showing how much the ground has shifted. Google has teamed up with sunglasses brand Luxottica, which makes Ray Bans and Persol, to design a new range of its Glass wear. And Natalie Massenet, Net A Porter's founder and chair of the British Fashion Council, declared she wanted London to be ""the most tech-savvy fashion capital in the world,"" as she launched London Fashion Week with Google. ""Innovation is hugely important for brands to showcase,"" said Matthew Drinkwater, head of the fashion innovation agency at London College of Fashion. ""There's recognition that the technology industry needs to engage with fashion lifestyle. All physical stores, not just premium brands, need to create a full experience for customers."" Drinkwater worked with Nokia on the first digital skirt made from mobile phones and with Microsoft on the first wireless charging trousers. He added: ""The brand has to live online and offline."" Burberry, which has more than 17 million likes on Facebook, is one luxury brand that has fully embraced fashion tech. Burberry, the British fashion house, is a pioneer in fashion technology. It has integrated the physical and digital in its flagship stores in London, Hong Kong and Chicago. Mirrors become screens showcasing catwalk images. There are about 100 screens and 500 speakers. There are no cash tills (like Apple stores) and you pay on devices. You can even experience weather -- simulated rain showers/sounds of thunder -- just to remind you why you might need a Burberry trench coat. They've rolled out the augmented technology with intelligent mirrors to show the outfit you're trying as if you were the star of a catwalk show. Luxury retailers have been early adopters of new technology and are more advanced in the field than high street retailers, with greater focus on enhancing the in-store experience with video and microchips in clothing for shoppers to interact with. Angela Ahrendts, the former CEO of Burberry who oversaw its digital revolution, was subsequently poached by Apple to help run their stores and develop new products. Although the average town's main chains have been slower to embrace fashion technology, there are signs of change. Stores have begun to embrace ""showrooming,"" where people examine the merchandise but purchase later online, often at lower cost, as an opportunity to engage. Topshop put digital at the heart of its London Fashion Week show by inviting influential bloggers to curate, for example. Chains are also embracing innovation through augmented reality software. Using camera-equipped mobile devices, apps can take detailed personal measurements to ensure clothes will be a perfect fit. The company Fits.me, founded in 2010, is a leading provider of virtual fitting room solutions. Clothes are photographed on robotic mannequins, allowing shoppers to try items on virtually. It means shoppers can try on every size with a few clicks and then choose the best fit. James Gambrell, chief executive of the start-up, explained: ""I'm a big online shopper and like many men I don't like to try on clothes. Instead of doing that thing where you buy three sizes we decided to try 3D modeling with robots. ""We have become better online than in stores. Online tech in retail can track where people go on the site. Such innovation needs to move back to the physical store."" The firm, Holition, has combined a fabric that changed color in the presence of certain pollutants and a sensor that detected the color change and uploaded the results to the cloud to produce a prototype garment that monitored air quality in Paris. Nike and Adidas have been looking at embedding sensors that connect to smartphones to give a more complete picture of someone's training regime or real-time health. Even Ralph Lauren, which is seen as a more traditional brand, has launched a polo shirt that records the wearer's biometric data. For companies like these, the goal is to create technical clothing that can passively monitor your health and activity without the wearer having to think about it or carry around additional technology. The forthcoming Apple Watch and iPhone 6 launch promised a new era for wearable technology. ""For the first time fashion is not just an add-on for technology. In the past a bag with a pouch for a phone was the extent of it,"" said Rachel Arthur, from trend forecaster WGSN. ""Now there's a partnership with fashion labels. With technology getting smaller, there's no reason that it won't be embedded in collections and accessories."" But others are more skeptical about wearables. Marc Curtis, head of innovation labs at digital agency TMW, said: ""Strictly speaking, ever since Casio launched their CA 53W calculator watch, we've been stealthily trying to combine our technology with our clothes, our watches, our hats, even our shoes. ""Arguably, Apple have not created anything unique in terms of technical innovation. However, they have placed mobile, contactless payments at the heart of their new devices."" Curtis is more excited by the potential of smart fabrics, cloths that can be embedded with sensors and microprocessors that can communicate with mobile phones to process information such as the wearers' heart rate or temperature. And that is potentially the future of fashion technology: seamless, subtle and intuitive. Read more: Wearable tech that will turn man into machine by 2015 . Watch: Ralph Lauren's new tech threads .

"London (CNN) -- An international manhunt is under way for the fighter shown in a video of the beheading of journalist James Foley -- and its focus is on Britain. The Islamic State militant on the video has his face covered, except for his eyes. But he has what sounds like a distinctly British accent. UK media reports are rife with speculation about where he's from. Linguistics experts say his accent indicates he is from southeast England or London, perhaps the capital's East End. As details of the cold-blooded execution of Foley emerged, British Prime Minister David Cameron interrupted his summer vacation to head a meeting of the government's emergency committee, known as COBRA, in London. Speaking to the media, he condemned the killing as ""a murder without any justification"" and said that while the man has not been identified, ""it looks increasingly likely that it is a British citizen."" Opinion: Why James Foley's murder was a message to Britain . A lengthy process . With an estimated 400 to 500 British recruits in Syria and Iraq -- though some believe the number to be much higher -- it may take time to identify the killer. And UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the government is well aware of the threat these British jihadis pose, at home as well as overseas. ""We've been saying for a very long time that there are a significant number of British nationals, both in Syria and Iraq, operating with extremist organizations,"" he said. ""Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the UK and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security. ""This is a poison, a cancer, what's going on in Iraq and Syria, and it risks spreading to other parts of the international community and affecting us all directly."" Easy recruits . Analysts who study the Islamic State say they are not surprised by the role played by a Briton in Foley's killing. ""The British fighters who have been going out to the Islamic State, who we've been monitoring now for many years, are really wanting to be at the forefront of this conflict,"" Shiraz Maher, a senior research fellow at King's College London, told CNN. ""They're not backseat drivers in any sense."" The power of the Internet means radicalization and recruitment of fighters is also alarmingly easy. According to a defector from the ranks of ISIS, the jihadist group runs a series of Internet chat groups to begin the process of indoctrinating and filtering potential recruits from outside Syria. Captors originally asked for huge ransom . Europeans sought after . The defector, who agreed to an interview with CNN earlier this summer but wanted to hide his identity, said that European recruits were more sought after and treated in a different class by the recruiters. ""There was special treatment for the Europeans,"" he said. ""One British guy said he was called Ibrahim, then told me he was from Manchester. One asked my emir (his unit's head) if he should fight in his own country, or come to Syria. He was told if God doesn't give you martyrdom in Syria, then he could wage war in his own country."" Maajid Nawaz, co-founder and chairman of Quilliam, a London-based counter-extremism think tank, told CNN that British jihadis -- writing on social media websites -- had made plain their intention to carry on their jihad when they return home. Some have posted pictures of themselves posing with homemade bombs. Nawaz said the estimated 500 British fighters in the region equates to roughly one in every 800 Sunni Muslim British men of fighting age. 'Fighters don't emerge from a vacuum' ""That's a huge proportion of this country's Muslim population who have succumbed to this level of violence,"" he said. ""Those fighters don't emerge from a vacuum, they don't just spring up from nothing. There must be some form of residual atmosphere that's prevalent within our communities here that somehow incubates that type of mindset. So it's definitely very worrying for us. ""There are roughly 3,000 from across Europe and of course we can travel throughout Europe without a visa -- so that means any country can succumb to these kind of attacks as soon as they return home."" Other attackers . Other Britons have helped carry out brazen attacks in Syria. Earlier this year, father-of-three Abdul Waheed Majid is believed to have become Britain's first known suicide bomber there, when he blew up a truck bomb as part of an ISIS assault on an Aleppo prison. The 41-year-old, from Crawley, south of London, told his family he was in Syria as a humanitarian worker -- not as an ISIS fighter. His uncle, Mohammad Jamil, said, ""He was a good family man. He had his head in the right place you know. We never thought he was linked to anyone other than his family and doing good deeds."" Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors . Propaganda value . Analysts say some of the propaganda value of the Western foreign fighter lies in that contradiction between their past and present identities. ""In showing a Briton decapitating an innocent civilian American, they've shown that they've deconstructed the boundaries of any former life of this British citizen,"" said Charlie Cooper, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation. ""He has left his country and he has gone to fight for the Islamic State, and in doing so he has completely rejected his former life. He's rejected all ideals that he used to live in and now he's happy to decapitate someone who is unarmed in front of a camera to further the message and threaten the rest of the world, as well as the United States. ""To break down someone to that level, to brainwash them like that, is immensely powerful."" London's Metropolitan Police confirmed Wednesday that its Counter Terrorism Command was investigating the video. Britain's MI5 domestic intelligence agency is also said to be involved in the hunt, as are U.S. authorities. Besides the brutality of his own actions, that potent capacity to radicalize others will only add to the urgency of the hunt for James Foley's killer. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Isa Soares and Jo Shelley contributed to this report.","The ISIS fighter who talks in the execution video has what sounds like a British accent .

"(CNN) -- The TV show of embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford was canceled Tuesday, just one day after it debuted. He and his brother hosted ""Ford Nation"" on Canada's Sun News Network. ""It beat our record of 100,000 viewers,"" but the time and production the show required does not make it a viable option, said Kory Teneycke, vice president of Sun News Network. The Ford brothers will appear as regular guests on Sun News programming, he said. The show debuted Monday, the same day the Toronto City Council voted to strip the mayor of most of his powers in a tumultuous meeting during which a charging Ford knocked down one of its members. Roughly two weeks after Ford admitted to smoking crack cocaine in a ""drunken stupor"" -- an admission forced by a drug investigation that resulted in extortion charges against a friend -- the mayor said he was done apologizing. He called Monday's vote ""a coup d'etat"" and compared it to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, warning council members, ""What goes around, comes around, friends."" Undeterred, the council voted 36-5 to slash the budget of the mayor's office and transfer most of his duties to the deputy mayor. City Councilor Karen Stintz said Ford ""doesn't understand the issues he's facing,"" and Monday's votes reduce him to ""a figurehead."" Ford says he didn't lie about crack use . The council already has called on Ford to take a leave of absence and voted to strip him of his emergency powers. In Monday's session, Ford and his brother, City Councilor Doug Ford, sparred with hecklers in the council gallery who chanted ""Shame, shame, shame"" during a recess. During that break, Rob Ford stomped over to his brother, knocking down Councilor Pam McConnell in the process, an apparently accidental act for which the mayor had to issue another apology.

"(CNN) -- Robert Molnar has a vision: an ocean race from New York to the Canadian Pacific city of Victoria, via the Arctic. ""Because of climate change, we can do this race,"" Molnar told CNN. He pictures oceangoing sailboats hugging the Atlantic coast up through Halifax to western Greenland, then heading west through the Northwest Passage to Tuktoyaktuk on Canada's Arctic coastline, before rounding Alaska to Dutch Harbor and, at last, Victoria. In 2017, Molnar plans to make this a reality in the form of the Sailing the Arctic Race, or STAR. ""The Arctic is the big attraction. There is a romanticism about it,"" says the 66-year-old, who spent decades working in advertising while nursing his passion for sailing. ""Crossing the Atlantic has been done so many times, going around the world this way, that way. ""Crossing the Arctic by sail? That's only been done by a few people, and only six people have done it twice,"" he claims. ""More people have been on the moon."" In the age of sail, the Arctic Ocean took hundreds of lives as explorers fought to navigate and conquer a vast, deadly stretch of water littered with sea ice and rocks. Earlier this week, Canadian authorities announced the discovery of a wreck from one of the most celebrated early, doomed voyages -- Sir John Franklin's 1845 expedition, during which all 129 crew members died. Sea ice conditions are much more favorable to shipping in the 21st century, and that makes Molnar confident his race can work. ""My job is, number one, safety,"" he insists. ""I don't want anyone to get hurt. ""The race isn't easy because of the climate, the ice, but we can take care of that. Our route is designed with the recommendations of people who were captains there all their lives, looking over our shoulder. ""But it is dangerous. It is definitely an extreme sport."" Extreme sailing is a major industry with the Volvo Ocean Race, a round-the-world event lasting nine months, one of the sport's signature contests. Molnar tells CNN he has Volvo Ocean Race participants prepared to take part in the inaugural race through the Northwest Passage, scheduled to begin in June 2017 and end in late September or early October. ""We already have more people willing to attend than there are spaces for boats,"" he adds. ""I want to go with 20 to 25 boats and the good thing is we have so many people wanting to go. ""That means we can pick who is the best-financed and who is the most experienced and, by doing so, we reduce the danger of trouble."" Richard Haworth, director of High Latitudes -- a company working with yachts to guide them through remote Arctic waters -- has reservations about the concept of an Arctic sailing race. ""All the races in the Southern Ocean currently, interestingly, have waypoints which keep them away from the main danger of icebergs,"" notes Haworth. ""This race, clearly, won't be able to do that. So that's a different safety philosophy. ""It's doable, but it will persuade people to push the limits a bit more. One of the things you don't do when you go up there is push the limits. ""You have to understand there is not so much help and assistance around. I would be surprised if that race happened without someone pushing the limits a bit too far and needing some assistance. Sooner or later, the Canadian authorities are going to get upset."" Mario Pelletier represents those authorities. As assistant commissioner of the Canadian Coast Guard, he shares Haworth's concerns. Pelletier is currently overseeing an intense and tricky Arctic shipping season which has forced a number of vessels to abandon planned crossings of the Northwest Passage. In his opinion, even planning a race three years from now is ambitious. ""If we're talking the Northwest Passage, the ice conditions we're seeing -- with multi-year ice coming down from the high Arctic -- it would be a huge challenge for 2017,"" says Pelletier. ""It's certainly not something, with the conditions we see today, that is likely to happen. And that is the first I've heard of it."" Molnar dismisses the suggestion his race will not go ahead, claiming the contested ownership of high Arctic waters is providing the political clout to push the event forward. ""It will happen, 110%,"" he says. ""There is no way around it. The support is surreal, I'm astonished. There is a lot of political will to make this happen. ""Canada wants to say, 'the Northwest Passage belongs to us.' There is a reason the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, was just there. He wants to make sure this is part of Canada. ""We will do that without the military. We will do that with sport."" The project is self-financed for now, though Molnar adds ""quite a bit of federal, provincial and local sponsorship"" has been secured. His ultimate ambition, he says, is for the race to educate the world about the fragility of the Arctic. STAR's plans call for children at each stopover destination on the race route to engage in up to six months of related schoolwork prior to the race's visit, culminating in presentations to local political and industry leaders. ""This is almost the most important part of the race,"" says Molnar. ""The kids can tell those leaders they are messing stuff up now, big time. They are drilling, they are fracking, they are breaking stuff. Those kids don't want to clean that up. ""The kids will put propositions on the table for alternatives, under huge scrutiny, presented to the whole world. ""I don't think we will save the planet, but we can show people how beautiful this place is -- and just don't mess it up. If you go there, go there gently.""","Sailing race planned from New York to Victoria, Canada via Northwest Passage .

"Washington (CNN) -- Within 24 hours of Osama bin Laden's death in a U.S. assault on his compound in Pakistan, administration and government officials -- both cloaked in anonymity and on the record -- provided misleading if not erroneous information about what happened in the al Qaeda leader's final moments. Bin Laden was shielded during the shooting by women, including his wife, they said. He was an active participant in an ongoing firefight, they insisted, implying bin Laden was armed and therefore gave U.S. Navy SEALs little choice but to shoot him down. Hours later, a senior administration official began to revise that narrative to some White House reporters. Further revisions came Tuesday when White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gave a step-by-step description of the raid provided by the Defense Department that made clear bin Laden was unarmed and had no human shields. Live blog: Bin Laden operation . Was it the fog of war, a bid to head off questions about killing bin Laden or perhaps a final propaganda salvo against the face of terrorism to Americans? Asked about the initial erroneous details, Carney shrugged it off as part of the difficulty in disseminating information quickly on a chaotic situation taking place halfway around the world. ""What is true is that we provided a great deal of information with great haste,"" Carney said, noting that some of the details came in ""piece by piece"" with frequent updates and elaboration. ""We have worked very hard to declassify information in record speed to provide as much insight into this operation as we can, as quickly as we can, mindful obviously of the equities that are at stake here in terms of never revealing sources and methods, never compromising our intelligence procedures,"" Carney said. However, his response failed to address why top officials including Brennan, a seasoned intelligence professional not known for misstatements, would go public with erroneous information that seemed intended to further disparage bin Laden. What bin Laden photos could show . Brennan was the first senior administration official after Obama's nationally televised statement Sunday night to speak on the record to reporters about what happened in Pakistan, appearing at Monday's White House news briefing with Carney. He said then that bin Laden ""was engaged in a firefight with those that entered the area of the house he was in,"" adding that he didn't know whether or not bin Laden ""got off any rounds."" Brennan also said that during the assault ""there was a female who was in fact in the line of fire that reportedly was used as a shield to shield bin Laden from the incoming fire."" He then urged the journalists to consider the bigger picture, seeming to mock bin Laden by saying he was ""living in this million dollar-plus compound, living in an area that is far removed from the front, hiding behind women who were put in front of him as a shield."" Time magazine: CIA chief on why Pakistan wasn't told . It wasn't just Brennan saying it. A senior defense official gave a similar description to reporters at a Pentagon background briefing, saying bin Laden and other male combatants at the compound ""certainly did use women as shields."" By Tuesday, that narrative had changed. Brennan, in an interview on Fox, backed off on the assertions that bin Laden was armed and had been shielded by women. ""Those details are still coming out,"" he said when asked about whether bin Laden shot at the U.S. assailants. ""There was a firefight in the compound. And I would wait to make a determination about whether or not he was armed and whether he fired."" On the human shield question, he said at least two women in the compound, including a wife of bin Laden, ""certainly resisted and they put themselves against the assaulters."" Courier identified who led U.S. to bin Laden . ""Whether or not they were trying to shield or whether they were trying to attack is still unclear,"" Brennan said. Carney later gave reporters a step-by-step description of the assault that also changed the initial details. ""On the first floor of bin Laden's building, two al Qaeda couriers were killed along with a woman who was killed in crossfire,"" Carney said. ""Bin Laden and his family were found on the second and third floor of the building."" Carney noted ""there was concern that bin Laden would oppose the capture operation ... and indeed he did resist."" ""In the room with bin Laden, a woman, rather bin Laden's wife, rushed the U.S. assaulter and was shot in the leg but not killed,"" Carney said. ""Bin Laden was then shot and killed. He was not armed."" Carney provided no further details on how bin Laden resisted. A U.S. official speaking on condition of not being identified told CNN on Tuesday that bin Laden was shot when he made a threatening move. When asked if bin Laden tried to grab a weapon or physically attack a commando, the official would only say: ""He didn't hold up his hands and surrender."" Bin Laden unarmed when killed, White House says . Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta, in an interview Tuesday with PBS, said the U.S. forces had clear authority to kill bin Laden. ""Obviously, under the rules of engagement, if he had in fact thrown up his hands, surrendered and didn't appear to be representing any kind of threat, then they were to capture him,"" Panetta said, adding he was unaware of any verbal communication between bin Laden and the American forces but that ""we're still getting the feedback from the SEALs themselves as to just exactly what took place during that mission."" To administration officials, the U.S. forces acted properly. ""It's very difficult for us, from here, to Monday morning quarterback a very difficult decision,"" Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough told CNN when asked Tuesday about bin Laden being killed while unarmed. ""Frankly, I don't know,"" McDonough continued. ""I've seen differing accounts as we gather more information. I don't know for certain whether bin Laden was armed or not. But I do know that our tremendous ... assault team that made that raid that day made exactly the right decision in each case, as far as I'm concerned."" Carney acknowledged the difficulty in getting all the facts right in such a situation, telling reporters that ""to use your phrase -- fog of war, fog of combat -- that there was a lot of information coming in. It is still unclear."" The impact of the initial reports was clear. In opening a House subcommittee hearing Tuesday on Pakistan, Rep. Patrick Meehan, R-Pennsylvania, mentioned the successful mission against bin Laden. ""That he reportedly died using a woman as a human shield is an image that cements the true nature of his character, and such cowardice will be a part of his legacy,"" Meehan said. CNN's Pam Benson contributed to this story.","Top officials got some things wrong in first comments on the bin Laden mission .

"(CNN) -- Comedy Central's successor to ""The Colbert Report"" will be ""The Minority Report with Larry Wilmore."" With ""The Minority Report,"" which starts next January, the cable channel is trying out a new format in the crowded late-night talk show field, just as it did with ""Colbert"" nearly a decade ago. Stephen Colbert and CBS announced last month that he would leave his ""Report"" at the end of 2014 and replace David Letterman on ""The Late Show"" sometime next year. Wilmore, meanwhile, will replace Colbert weeknights at 11:30 p.m. on Comedy Central, following ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" at 11 p.m. Wilmore appeared several times on ""The Daily Show"" as its ""senior black correspondent."" His ""Report"" will diversify the television lineup, since most late-night comics are white men. ""'The Minority Report with Larry Wilmore' follows in the Comedy Central tradition -- bringing new perspectives to the day's events and breaking ground in the world of late night television,"" said Michele Ganeless, the president of Comedy Central, in a news release. The satirical ""Colbert Report,"" which premiered in 2005, took its cues from conservative talking head programs such as ""The O'Reilly Factor"" which were newly prominent at the time. Similarly, ""The Minority Report"" will borrow from the ""panel shows"" that have proliferated on cable news. (Fox News has a brand-new one at noon Eastern time, ""Outnumbered,"" with four women and one man, and a popular one at 5 p.m., ""The Five."") ""The series will feature a diverse panel of voices currently underrepresented in comedy and television,"" Comedy Central said. Stewart's Busboy Productions developed both the ""Colbert Report"" and the ""Minority Report."" Wilmore called himself ""beyond excited to have this chance to continue my relationships with Comedy Central and the brilliant Jon Stewart.""

"(CNN) -- It seems there's no such thing as time off for Jay Z and Beyonce. On Tuesday, Dash Radio's DJ Skee reported that the ""Drunk in Love"" duo have plans to collaborate on a joint album, according to sources close to the couple. DJ Skee believes the album could arrive in late 2014 or early 2015. When asked about the report, a Jay Z spokesperson told CNN, ""Please ask DJ Skee."" Such reticence about rumors has been standard procedure for the power couple, whose ""On the Run"" tour opened in June under speculation of a pending divorce but ended last weekend in Paris with gossip of another pregnancy. The couple -- who wed in 2008 and are also parents to 2-year-old Blue Ivy Carter -- earned $100 million in ticket sales from their stadium trek, Billboard reported. In 2013, Forbes named Jay Z and Beyonce the highest-paid couple in entertainment. Speaking to E!, which first reported the news, Dash Radio's vice president of pop programming, Karli Henriquez, called the reported collaboration ""huge.""

"(CNN) -- Angelina Jolie's stunning announcement that she had a preventive double mastectomy raised both awareness and questions about the gene that led to her decision -- BRCA1. So what is the gene, and how can it increase a woman's risks for breast and ovarian cancers? A primer: . What is BRCA1? BRCA1 and BRCA 2 are types of tumor-suppressing genes, according to the National Cancer Institute. In normal cells, those genes help stabilize the cell's DNA and help prevent uncontrollable cell growth. But harmful mutations in BRCA genes can lead to breast or ovarian cancer. Five reasons we love Angelina Jolie . What do BRCA1 and BRCA2 stand for? The acronyms stem from the full names of the genes: breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 and breast cancer susceptibility gene 2. What's the difference between BRCA1 and BRCA2? The genes are very similar. But harmful mutations in BRCA1 can lead to breast cancers that are harder to treat because they don't respond to hormone therapies used to treat tumors that occur more often in women with BRCA2 mutations, according to The Breast Care Site. What's the likelihood of getting breast or ovarian cancer if you have a BRCA mutation? About 12% of all women will develop breast cancer sometime in their lives, the National Cancer Institute says. But for women with a harmful BRCA mutation, the risk of breast cancer quintuples to 60%. Myriad Genetics, which created a test to screen for such mutations, said the risk of breast cancer can be as high as 87% for those with BRCA abnormalities. As for ovarian cancer, about 1.4% of women will have the disease sometime in their lives, according to the National Cancer Institute. But the risk for women with a harmful BRCA mutation increases to 15% to 40%. How surgeons build new breasts . How can you tell if you have BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations? A blood test at a hospital or doctor's office can help detect BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, according to the National Cancer Institute. Results could take several weeks, as the test must be performed by a laboratory that specializes in the screening. But testing can cost anywhere from several hundred to several thousand dollars, and insurance companies may or may not cover the cost. Only women with increased risk from family history are likely to benefit from such genetic testing, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only 3% to 5% of women who develop breast cancer have a BRCA mutation, and about 10% to 15% of women with ovarian cancer have a BRCA mutation. Can BRCA abnormalities affect men? Yes. Although only 1% of all breast cancers occur in men, having a BRCA mutation means an increased risk, particularly for men with BRCA2 mutations, according to The Breast Care Site. Harmful BRCA mutations also raise a man's chance of developing cancer of the pancreas, skin or prostate. Why more women are choosing double mastectomies .","Mutations in the tumor-suppressing gene BRCA1 can increase the risk of cancer .
Harmful BRCA mutations can increase a woman's risk for breast cancer five times .

"(CNN) -- You don't often find Jordan splashed across the top of your favorite news site. Big on the grand desert scenery and ancient monuments you'd expect, but absent from any roll call of travel-warning infamy on government websites, this is a nation that confounds traveler perceptions of the Middle East. Here's why. 1. Bedouin culture is at the root of Jordanian hospitality . Ahlan wa Sahlan (""hello and welcome"") follows you wherever you go. For Jordanians, hospitality is part of life, founded in a centuries-old nomadic culture. Visitors who set their itineraries in stone risk missing out on all the spontaneous invitations to sit back and drink endless tiny glasses of tea with locals. 2. Landscapes are film stars . If the scenery gives you dÃ©jÃ  vu, that's because you've probably seen it before. Jordan is a kingdom of blockbuster countryside that's graced cinema screens countless times. Petra's Al-khaznah (The Treasury) monument posed as the home of the Holy Grail in ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade."" The high-rise cliffs and blush pink sands of Wadi Rum played themselves in ""Lawrence of Arabia."" At 89,342 square kilometers, Jordan may be relatively small, but its vistas are the stuff of epic silver screen classics. 3. It's a regional eco-lodge leader . Sustainable travel has a long road to travel in the Middle East, but Jordan is leading the way. The Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature operates ten protected areas in the country with eco-lodge accommodation options. Dana Biosphere Reserve tumbles down the chasm of the Great Rift Valley with Dana Guest House (Dana village, +962 03 227 0497) clinging to a cliff edge from where the sandstone hills of the national park spool out below. At Mujib Biosphere Reserve -- the world's lowest altitude national park -- you can sleep at Mujib Chalets (Mujib bridge, Dead Sea Highway, +962 079 907 4960) for canyon hiking and the Dead Sea on your doorstep at 416 meters below sea level. Jordan's most famous national park is Wadi Rum, where you can spend the night amid the silent desert expanse at a simple Bedouin Beit Shar (goat-hair tent) encampment. 4. Levantine flavors in Amman . Amman is Jordan's capital city, as well as its culinary capital. Lunch lines outside Al-Quds on Rainbow Street indicate the city's best falafel. You can do coffee with one of Amman's best views at the Wild Jordan Cafe (Othman bin Affan Street, +962 06 463 3542), and try Levant's finest dishes amid the opulence of an old Ottoman mansion at Fakhr El-Din (40 Taha Hussein St., +962 06 465 2399). Beit Sitti (16 Muhammad Ali al-Saadi St., +962 079 563 3868) run classes in Arabic cooking that teach you pro skills for your next Middle Eastern-themed dinner party. 5. Using the car horn for brakes doesn't cut it here . Seasoned Middle East travelers will tell you the biggest safety concern in the region is for your hearing. The traffic crush -- and cacophony of car horns -- is a constant stress. Not in Jordan. With a population of only 6.5 million, and plenty of open spaces, Jordanian drivers don't feel the need to thump out a constant tuneless blast of beeps. 6. Cultural tours that make a difference . In recent years, small local initiatives have begun changing the face of tourism by offering a look into the Jordan beyond the famous ruins. The Zikra Initiative operates a tourism-exchange program in which travelers take part in traditional village activities -- cooking, banana-leaf basket making -- for a small fee that gets funneled into micro-loans to help the village community. Middle East travel specialist Backpacker Concierge operates a number of cultural immersion tours in Jordan. 7. Ruins everywhere . If you want to see megalithic monuments, Jordan won't let you down. Jerash is one of the best-preserved Greco-Roman towns in the world. A walk along its long Cardo Maximus from the South Theater to the Temple of Artemis offers an evocative slice of the Classical Age. The Greek, Roman, Byzantine and Arab Empires stamped their hand prints across the countryside. Head north (or east, on the desert castle loop) from the glorious tumble of columns and temples at ancient Umm Qais or Pella, and you'll find the Umayyad caliphs' country retreats of Azraq Fort and the UNESCO-listed Qasr Amr. 8. The Abraham Path . Jordan's Ajloun region has a five-day hiking trail that's part of the multi-country Abraham Path. The shorter, one-day Ajloun-Orjan village section starts at the Crusader castle of Ajloun, drops in at Mar Elias (said to be the birthplace of the prophet Elijah) and finishes at sleepy Orjan, where homestays are available. 9. The Middle East's best road trip . Between Madaba and Petra, the King's Highway winds along the ridge edge of the Great Rift Valley. It's filled with historic sites and offers some of the country's most startling views. Moses saw the Promised Land at Mt. Nebo, Salome's shimmying ended with St. John the Baptist losing his head on Herod's mountain eyrie of Mukawir, and Reynald of Chatillon was defeated by Salah ud-Din at the Crusader castle of Kerak. About halfway through the trip, a highway turnoff leads to a road that twists and turns down to the Dead Sea where you can float in waters so mineral rich that you can't sink. 10. Petra -- as if we wouldn't mention it . You can't mention Jordan without talking about Petra. By the time you get here you'll have seen its famous Al-Khazneh (The Treasury) and Ed-Deir (The Monastery) monuments hundreds of times, splashed across tourism posters throughout Jordan. For a different take on the Nabataean's ancient capital, you can get off the main trail to the site and onto the Bedouin back roads. The winding trail up to the cliff ridge of Al-Habees has the best views over the central city ruins. A stone-cut staircase trail snakes up Jabal al-Khubtha for dramatic views of The Treasury from above.","Bedouin culture is at the root of Jordanian hospitality .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Chinese-Australian artist who covered a diorama of Tiananmen Square in ground pork is to be deported from China, according to Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). Guo Jian was taken into custody last weekend, a day after The Financial Times published an interview with the artist, and photos of his latest work. The piece, called ""The Square,"" shows the Beijing landmark covered in 160 kilograms of ground meat. In the accompanying FT article, Guo was highly critical of the actions of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) on June 4, 1989, when troops opened fire on civilians around Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds if not thousands of people. ""The army is regarded as a loveable institution. But at Tiananmen I realized it's not, they will kill you if ordered to,"" he was quoted as saying. 'Visa-related' matter . According to a DFAT spokesman, consular officers visited Guo in Beijing on June 5. They said Chinese authorities said Guo was being held on a ""visa-related matter"" and would be deported after 15 days' detention. Amnesty International's China researcher William Nee said the timing of Guo's deportation was ""incredibly odd,"" given the artist has worked in the country for a number of years. ""It seems incredibly odd timing that right after he gives an interview that is very moving to the FT and he comes out with a very shocking and moving piece of artwork, that is the time that the government decides to detain him about a visa-related issue,"" Nee said. ""As far as I know, he did not leave the country or get detained for some other unrelated event. It was almost certainly due to his freedom of expression which the government did not approve of,"" he added. Born in China, Guo joined the PLA in the late 1970s during a recruitment drive to support the Sino-Vietnamese war, according to his website. He was just 17 years old. After leaving the army, Guo worked as a propaganda officer for a transport company and later studied art in Beijing. He told the FT he witnessed shooting near Tiananmen Square on the night of the massacre, and saw bodies stacked outside a local hospital. ""Walking into the hospital, walking into the emergency room packed with bodies, the smell was much stronger than in my studio. I just couldn't do anything and wanted to throw up. I was shocked, angry, sad and hopeless,"" he told the FT. After the Tiananmen crackdown, Guo moved to Australia where he became a citizen and lived for 13 years. 'Don't call me' On Monday, one of Guo's friends told CNN he'd called Guo to discuss the FT article. No one answered, but the artist texted him soon after to say he was ""with police,"" followed by another SMS: ""don't call me"". The friend said Guo was aware of the provocative nature of his work. ""He's not naÃ¯ve about this stuff,"" he said. Prior to finishing the project, Guo asked the friend not to tell anyone about it, for fear that the authorities would stop him from working on it. Ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre, authorities across the country arrested a number of prominent dissidents and critics of the government. CNN's Euan McKirdy and David McKenzie contributed to this report.","Chinese-Australian artist Guo Jian to be deported from China .

"(CNN) -- A Connecticut store that sold a gun used to kill 26 people last December at Sandy Hook Elementary School no longer can legally sell firearms. Debora Seifert, a spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told CNN on Friday the Riverview Gun Sales shop in East Windsor, Connecticut, lost its federal firearms license December 20 -- six days after the massacre about 65 miles southwest in Newtown. That day, after killing his mother in their Newtown home, Adam Lanza drove to the elementary school and shot dead 20 young children and six adults using a semiautomatic Bushmaster .223-caliber model XM15 rifle. The shooter's mother, Nancy Lanza, bought the Bushmaster firearm two years ago at Riverview Gun Sales, according to Detective Matthew Carl of the East Windsor Police Department. The ATF spokeswoman did not comment on why the store's license was revoked, including if it had anything to do with the Newtown rampage. But Carl said ""probably the reason the ATF raided the store on December 20 was for poor keeping of the records."" According to police, on December 15 -- a day after the Sandy Hook shooting -- a man was arrested at Riverview Gun Sales for stealing a .50-caliber firearm. Upon investigation, authorities learned the man allegedly stole a Wyndham firearm from the same shop four days earlier; in fact, he'd been arrested in June 2011 for allegedly stealing nine firearms from the store. Newtown shooting details revealed in newly released documents . Afterward, authorities told Riverview Gun Sales' owner David LaGuercia of the December arrest and checked surveillance images. LaGuercia was not aware multiple thefts had taken place. ""The owner is nonchalant. He is a very non-caring gun owner, very lax in his paperwork,"" said Carl, the East Windsor detective. ""He was eventually closed for hundreds and hundreds of federal and state law violations."" LaGuercia, the store's owner, could not be reached for comment on Friday. His store has reopened but no longer sells guns, the detective said, though shoppers can still buy survival equipment and other items there. The ATF conducted more than 11,400 firearms compliance inspections in 2012. The federal agency sought to revoke licenses in about 100 cases that year, which works out to less than 1% of all places inspected. According to the ATF website, violations commonly cited in license revocation include ""failure to account for firearms, failure to verify and document purchaser eligibility, failure to maintain records requisite for successful firearms tracing, and failure to report multiple sales of handguns."" This past week, Connecticut passed what advocacy groups call the strongest gun-control legislation of any state in the country. The law bans the sale or purchase of high-capacity magazines, like the ones used in the Newtown shooting, and requires background checks for all gun purchases.","Adam Lanza's mother bought a semiautomatic Bushmaster rifle at Riverview Gun Sales .

"(CNN) -- He is the king of clicks, the biggest star in the most powerful media platform to emerge in recent years. But unless your date of birth hovers near the year 1990, you've probably never heard of him. Shane Dawson, a 22-year-old college dropout from California, is a YouTube superstar and the epitome of the new era of Do-It-Yourself celebrity. He produces three videos a week for YouTube from his Los Angeles area home. Uploads of his videos approach half a billion views a year. ""I thought I'd be on TV and movies - that's what I really wanted - and I can't believe I didn't need to do that,"" said Dawson on finding fame and an outlet for his comedy on YouTube. ""I did it on my own with just me and my camera. That's very, very weird."" And very rare. With 12 hours of video uploaded on YouTube every minute - and the volume on the rise - scoring a devoted clicking audience online is difficult. ""Your odds are like winning the lottery, and its getting worse all the time,"" said David Burch, communications director for TubeMogul Inc., an online video analysis firm. Companies are finding increasing success capturing a commercial audience via YouTube. Videos produced by companies captured nearly 5 percent of YouTube's daily top 100 in February - up from 0.4 percent in October 2009, Burch said. And companies are digging deeper to find their niche audience through YouTubers. ""You're seeing girls doing cosmetic how-to videos getting sponsorships from cosmetic companies,"" Burch said. ""These girls drop a video and get 3 million views a weeks - that's a lot."" But the odds of individuals making real money on YouTube remain long. TubeMogul estimates that only 15 independent YouTube acts make more than $100,000 a year from banner advertisements on their videos, and only two acts make more than $200,000 a year. Dawson is estimated by TubeMogul to be the top earner with an estimated $295,000 in revenues a year. (Dawson and his manager declined to discuss or confirm his YouTube earnings.) ""These YouTube celebrities are making some great content resonating with a very young audience where the advertising revenues aren't as high,"" Burch said. And still a legion of Dawson wannabes pour more content onto YouTube each day. CNN asked Dawson and TubeMogul's Burch to share their tips on how to be an online video star. Volume, volume, volume . Monday for Dawson is spent uploading his new videos and scripting for the week ahead. Tuesday he collects props and builds sets, if necessary. Wednesday is spent filming, Thursdays editing, Fridays mapping out his second channel video, Saturday is for mopping up unfinished work and on Sunday he picks costumes, themes and dance moves for his weekly ""Ask Shane"" video. As a result, Dawson doesn't sleep much depite the protestations from his manager to get more rest. But his consistent volume of new videos has helped Dawson succeed where many major companies have failed. ""A lot of companies went into the YouTube frontier a year-and-a-half or two years ago, but what they didn't have was frequency,"" Burch said. ""You have to update at least once a week, preferably more."" A video posted on YouTube gets half its views in the first two weeks its online, Burch said. Love it, or leave it . Dawson began shooting videos with his brother when he was 10 years old. As an overweight teenager, he dreamed of a career in Hollywood as an actor and wrote one-act plays for his high school drama class. ""I've always been doing videos,"" Dawson said. His avocation turned into a profession two years ago after an incident that otherwise would be an Internet 2.0 cautionary tale: He and others were fired from a weight-loss center in August 2008 for a video he posted online that was shot in the workplace. ""I didn't think it was so bad, but someone didn't think it was funny,"" Dawson recalls. ""I laugh about it now, but it was probably the most depressing time of my life. I had so much guilt, and got six people fired."" Although he had posted videos to YouTube infrequently since 2005, his dismissal caused him to focus full-time on his videos to earn a living. ""I was out of work and couldn't collect unemployment because I was fired,"" he said. Because the odds of success are so small, the labor has to be its own reward before it reaps financial dividends, said Burch of TubeMogul. ""If you don't love doing this without making money, give it up,"" Burch said. Dare to be different . Dawson's videos feature a stable of characters he impersonates. The content leans to the raunchy and straddles the lines of taste (such as a parody of ""Twilight"" that has a vampire drinking menstrual blood). ""It's easy to say what these people are doing is so stupid, so asinine,"" Burch said. ""Anyone over 30 probably hasn't heard of these top acts. But it's mostly young kids, and they're resonating with kids."" Dawson started his YouTube career video blogging - or vlogging, talking directly to the camera and making self-deprecating observations about his life. ""The first sketch I did was from me having fun at three in the morning, wearing wigs and doing this character for my mom as a phone sex operator,"" Dawson recalls. ""It doubled the number of views and people started subscribing to me - I didn't even know what 'subscribing' was."" Now Dawson has nearly four million subscribers to his three YouTube channels who receive notifications on their YouTube homepage of new videos released. ""It sounds super cliché, but staying true to yourself and what you are works,"" Dawson said. ""People bitch about my videos being too raunchy or whatever, but I'm just making videos for myself. Make the videos that you want to watch, don't think about who is going to be upset or offended."" Stay close to your audience . Like other YouTube successes, Dawson has a wide presence on social networking sites like FaceBook and Twitter. In the early days, Dawson responded to everyone who posted to his MySpace page, ""but that got harder after I had 100,000 subscribers."" Still he elicits and shares feedback from his viewers. Ironically, one of the best ways to reach him these days is through snail mail. ""I have a P.O. Box that I get about 50 letters a day that my mom picks up, and a lot of weird gifts I like to show on my videos,"" he said. ""You have to be open ... it's about letting people into your life,"" Dawson said. YouTube sensations like Dawson ""build an audience one member at a time; they will answer email one person at a time,"" Burch of TubeMogul said. ""They really engage their audience by making a personal connection.""","Shane Dawson's YouTube videos have nearly a half billion uploads .
About 12 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute .

"(CNN) -- President Obama attracted a lot of attention when he went on ""Between Two Ferns,"" going mano-a-mano with comedian Zach Galifianakis. The President handled Galifianakis' barbs well, throwing some back at the comedian (ridiculing his film ""Hangover 3,"" for example) and successfully stoking interest in his health care program, based on the uptick in traffic that followed. The show was condemned by some who saw it as disrespectful of the office of the presidency; others said the president performed brilliantly, doing what presidents need to do in this day and age, by appearing on a hip and edgy popular culture outlet. Reaching young people any way he can is particularly urgent with the March 31 deadline for health coverage enrollment under the Affordable Care Act. The administration has not made its sign-up targets, and evidence suggests balance between young and healthy versus old and infirm is not what the President wanted. But while gimmicks like the ""Ferns"" appearance may produce some quick-hit results, they won't go far in re-energizing young people about Obama's presidency. In the case of the health care program, for example, it seems that many young people have not been convinced the program is in their best interest. A good part of this has to do with the failure of the administration to explain this complex program to the public since its inception. If President Obama -- or politicians from either party -- really want to engage younger Americans and reignite the energy of 2008, they will need to do much more. Americans in their late teens and early 20s who are just starting to vote are not so gullible or pliable. They are looking for help in tough times. They want their government to offer real solutions to real problems that they see, not just cool appearances that might make them laugh a bit. Like all the other Americans who are struggling in the modern economy, younger voters want job security. Too many leave college without any good job prospects and those who do succeed often find jobs with meager benefits and limited long-term stability. This is a far cry from the 1950s and 1960s, the era when young Americans who finished their high school education and went to college could expect to enter careers that would bring them financial security and allow them to do better than their parents. As Sarah Ayers of the Center for American Progress noted, the unemployment crisis for young Americans includes ""high school students who are having a harder time finding after-school jobs, twenty-somethings who are increasingly stuck in unpaid internships instead of paying jobs, and college students who are settling for low-wage, low-skill jobs such as waiting tables or serving coffee."" Many younger Americans exiting college work multiple jobs to make ends meet or find work in transitory positions without benefits. According to the New York Fed, unemployment is at its worst rate in two years for recent college graduates and many fortunate to have employment are in jobs that don't require their degrees. President Obama has not been able to do much about this situation. While he worked hard to push a stimulus bill that would move the nation out of recession in 2009, long-term investment in jobs has not been a big part of his record. In his stimulus bill, passed at the height of his influence, the President focused too much on tax cuts and not enough on the kinds of public jobs that would have been attractive to younger Americans struggling to find a place in the workforce. The cost of using his political capital on health care, moreover, was to diminish the possibility for greater public investments in growing areas of the job market. Neither has the President figured out how to halt the flight of jobs to other countries. What's more, young people also see a Washington that is broken, a city gridlocked in partisan conflict as decisions revolve around powerful single-issue lobbyists who gain influence by throwing money at candidates. When Obama originally ran for the presidency, he promised to promote a different kind of politics. He took the political process seriously, and argued that without campaign finance, lobbying and other kinds of government reforms, politics would never get better. Yet after taking office he abandoned many of those efforts in order to focus on immediate economic and foreign policy crises. The decision to leave government reform behind has had long-term costs, among them a loss of trust among younger Americans in the basic character of the political process. The institutions of government seem as broken in 2014 as they did in 2008. President Obama also lost many millennials by continuing to uphold and expand aspects of President Bush's War on Terrorism that trampled on civil liberties. While young people, like all Americans, agree that the federal government needs to protect the nation from terrorist threats, they also don't like all the revelations about how the National Security Agency has conducted intensive surveillance into telephone conversations, texting and Internet traffic. For millennial Americans who distrust so many institutions, the freedom and right to communicate through the Internet has defined much of their lives. This has been the realm through which they experience the world. As they have learned how President Obama's administration oversaw data logging efforts that undermined some of the very freedom they desired, he has continued to lose some of their trust. According to a poll by Harvard University's Institute of Politics in December 2013, many Americans between 19 and 29 years of age think the surveillance programs go too far. Nor has President Obama been able to make much progress on an issue that matters very much to younger Americans, one that will affect them much more than seniors who have greater political clout: climate change. Younger Americans have grown up learning about the disastrous consequences of human decisions on the environment and observing frightening swings in the weather that portend greater dangers. A bipartisan poll in 2013 found strong support among younger voters for a climate change bill. Yet despite bold words of support for climate change legislation, the President has been unable to move Congress on this issue and, by many accounts, he has not made this a real priority in his administration. For many younger Americans this has been a great disappointment. The activism surrounding the President's upcoming decision on the Keystone pipeline has highlighted this. To be sure, the President has faced intractable opposition from Republicans in Congress who have refused to move on this issue and have stifled one of the initiatives that could have been hugely attractive to younger Americans. Even his biggest policy accomplishment for younger Americans—allowing people to stay on their parent's health insurance policies until age 26—has been blunted by the unpopularity of the individual mandate many of them will be subjected to, as well as the failure to impose tougher cost controls, which may mean higher prices for those who do buy insurance. Going on fun entertainment shows is certainly an interesting and probably effective way to reach young Americans on the Affordable Care Act, but after all the disappointment and heartbreak they have experienced since he took office, that's about as far as it can go. In the near future, the administration must do a better job to explain how the particulars of the health care program benefit younger Americans and to at least try to make progress—even if through executive power—on issues like climate change. It must be clear to young voters, if Democrats can overcome this political problem, that the GOP rather than the President's lack of interest is to blame for the lack of progress. With Keystone, the decision is in Obama's control. The President should also continue to work on smaller programs, such as student loans, where he has been able to deliver tangible results to this population. Obama and other politicians, in both parties, must remember: To excite disenchanted voters distrustful of all institutions, you must show that you can make progress on the policy issues that matter to them and to do so through a stronger political process that leads them to believe in politics once again.

"Washington (CNN) -- In his first extensive comments about the controversy over the name of Washington's pro football team, owner Dan Snyder penned a letter to fans defending his decision not to change the Redskins name. ""Our franchise has a great history, tradition and legacy representing our proud alumni and literally tens of millions of loyal fans worldwide,"" Snyder wrote. ""We are proud of our team and the passion of our loyal fans. Our fans sing 'Hail to the Redskins' in celebration at every Redskins game. They speak proudly of 'Redskins Nation' in honor of a sports team they love."" Critics have been pressuring the Redskins organization to consider a name change, arguing that the term is an offensive racial slur that causes serious social and mental stress to Native American communities. But Snyder -- born and raised a Redskins fan -- has remained resolute in his opposition to a new name. ""When I consider the Washington Redskins name, I think of what it stands for. I think of the Washington Redskins traditions and pride I want to share with my three children, just as my father shared with me -- and just as you have shared with your family and friends,"" Snyder said. Snyder has until now been reluctant to even address the issue; his most extensive comments came last spring when he emphatically told USA Today last spring that he will ""never"" change the name. But recent attention has made it more difficult to ignore the issue. A group led by the Oneida Indian Nation launched its ""Change the Mascot"" media campaign last month. And President Obama weighed in last week, telling The Associate Press that he would ""consider changing the name,"" if he were the owner of team whose name offended a group of people. Opinion: Obama is right about 'Redskins' NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has also expressed a need for dialogue. At the NFL's annual fall meeting Tuesday, Goodell reiterated that as a Redskins fan, he does not consider the name derogatory, but ""whenever you have a situation like this, you have to listen and recognize that some other people might have different perspectives."" ""We all want to do things to honor people and not to do anything in a negative way,"" Goodell said. Snyder says he is listening, but the name is not going away. ""I respect the feelings of those who are offended by the team name. But I hope such individuals also try to respect what the name means, not only for all of us in the extended Washington Redskins family, but among Native Americans too,"" Snyder said, citing several polls conducted in recent years that show that a majority of people do not want the name changed. ""After 81 years, the team name 'Redskins' continues to hold the memories and meaning of where we came from, who we are, and who we want to be in the years to come,"" Snyder said. But Oneida Nation representative Ray Halbritter told CNN Monday that poll numbers don't matter as long as anyone is offended by the name. ""It's a dictionary defined offensive racial epithet. You shouldn't be using that to sell a national sports team to America or to the rest of the world,"" Halbritter said. The NFL confirmed on Monday that it would send representatives to meet with Oneida leaders at a later date. It is unclear whether Snyder will be part of those meetings, but Halbritter said he hopes Snyder will come because ""it is clear from Mr. Snyder's letter that he does not understand (the) consequences"" of using Redskins as a team name. ""In the spirit of the dialogue that Mr. Snyder says he is willing to engage in, we are inviting him to join the NFL delegation in its upcoming meeting at our homelands,"" Halbritter said Wednesday. ""During his visit, we will organize a special meeting of Oneida Nation families where Mr. Snyder can personally explain to them why he believes they deserve to be called 'redskins.'""

"(CNN) -- Wisconsin on Friday joined the growing number of states where federal judges have struck down same-sex marriage bans. The decision was cheered by lesbian and gay rights advocates, but it's not necessarily a final victory. The Wisconsin ban violates the U.S. Constitution, said U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb. She said same-sex couples ""are entitled to the same treatment as any heterosexual couple."" ""I conclude that the Wisconsin laws prohibiting marriage between same-sex couples interfere with plaintiffs' right to marry, in violation of the due process clause, and discriminate against plaintiffs on the basis of sexual orientation, in violation of the (Constitution's) equal protection clause,"" the judge wrote. Crabb did not immediately stay her own ruling, as some other federal judges issuing similar decisions have done, nor did she state that it takes effect right away. Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen said the current law restricting marriage to one man and one woman, which is written into the Wisconsin state constitution, ""remains in force."" ""While today's decision is a setback, we'll continue to defend the constitutionality of our traditional marriage laws and the constitutional amendment, which was overwhelmingly approved by voters,"" Van Hollen said. ""I will appeal."" Opinion: Marriage equality is unstoppable . In her ruling, Crabb noted that all federal judges weighing in on state same-sex marriage bans have come to the same conclusion -- that such prohibitions should not stand -- since the Supreme Court's landmark ruling on U.S. v. Winsdor last June. That 5-4 opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, struck down the Defense of Marriage Act's definition of marriage as only between a man and a woman but did not directly affect individual states' laws restricting marriage based on sexual orientation. Yet many federal judges have cited the decision on United States v. Windsor in their judgments, as well as the argument that same-sex marriage bans violate the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Several appeals courts have heard arguments on some of the district court rulings that have been challenged, though none has come out with its own decision. Van Hollen said he expects ""the U.S. Supreme Court will give finality to this issue in their next term."" Even if it's not a final decision, LGBT advocates cheered Friday's ruling on Wisconsin. ""Across the country, the courts agree: Same-sex couples and their families need the dignity of marriage, and anti-marriage laws are indefensible,"" said Evan Wolfson, president of the advocacy group Freedom to Marry. ""... Today's decision in Wisconsin underscores that all of America is ready for the freedom to marry. It's time now for the Supreme Court to bring resolution nationwide.""

"(CNN) -- ""When I visit Malawi, I visit my family at the graveyard,"" says Marie Da Silva, who knows the impact of AIDS all too well. Marie da Silva says the name for her school comes from the Jacaranda tree, which symbolizes hope. Born and bred in Malawi, in southern Africa, Da Silva lost 14 family members, including her father and two brothers, to the disease. ""AIDS is like The Plague in Malawi,"" says Da Silva. According to UNAIDS, 14 percent of the country's adult population is infected with HIV and more than half a million children have been orphaned by the disease. ""Orphans [in Malawi] are very underprivileged -- the grandparents are trying to raise them, with no money, no food, no clothes,"" she says. ""Just poverty."" But from halfway around the world, as a nanny in Los Angeles, California, Da Silva provides a place where the orphans can get away from that -- The Jacaranda School.  Watch Da Silva talk about her school » . In 2002, Da Silva learned that the school in her southern Africa home town was going to close. Consumed with concern for the students, she urged her mother to let them gather and learn in their family home, with her financial support. ""All the while I was doing my best for the kids here -- making sure they're doing their homework, eating well,"" she remembers. ""I couldn't sleep just thinking about the children that need the same thing back in Malawi,"" says Da Silva. Thanks to Da Silva's passion, the school is now thriving in her childhood home and more than 200 children, most of whom are AIDS orphans, receive porridge every morning and education, free of charge. It is an effort that Da Silva funds almost entirely herself, sending $1,000, about one-third of her monthly paycheck, to pay the salaries of 12 teachers and the headmaster, and purchase whatever supplies she can afford. Several of her fellow nannies have even gotten involved, donating $10 a month to her foundation. Get involved: Jacaranda Foundation . While the classes are crowded and resources are few (there are only 15 books in the library, according to Da Silva), her efforts are working. ""We have kids studying in our family living room, kitchen, gazebo, you name it. They're so hungry to learn,"" Da Silva explains. ""This is their sanctuary.""  Watch two teachers -- in different continents -- read a story from a young student » . Da Silva named both the school and its supporting foundation after the Jacaranda tree. Not only does the tree grow both in Malawi and Los Angeles, but when her father was dying, she found solace in a blossoming Jacaranda tree that she could see from his hospital window. ""For me, the Jacaranda tree symbolizes hope, and that's what I want to give to the children at the Jacaranda School,"" she says. ""After the deaths of my family members and...seeing how everything else is suffering, the only way around this was if kids have a future."" She dreams of building a new school with lab facilities and a real library one day. ""I just feel that if you give them the tools, they can be somebody. And that's my mission.""","Marie Da Silva is a nanny in Los Angeles .

"(CNN) -- Praise the Internet and pass the ammunition: the blogosphere is roiling with conspiracy theories over a Social Security Administration shopping list for 174,000 hollow-point bullets. Depending on whom you believe, police who protect Social Security Administration officers are either preparing for impending financial doom by purchasing lethal ammo to put down rioting citizens, or they're just making a standard purchase of ammunition for a federal police agency. It all began last month when the agency, which is primarily responsible for distributing benefits to the disabled and retired people, posted an announcement seeking bids for 174,000 hollow-point bullets. Why? cried some bloggers. Infowars, a website operated by right-wing talk show host Alex Jones, wanted to know if the agency was preparing for ""civil unrest."" ""Social Security welfare is estimated to keep around 40 per cent of senior citizens out of poverty. Should the tap run dry in the aftermath of an economic collapse which the Federal Reserve has already told top banks to prepare for, domestic disorder could ensue if people are refused their benefits,"" it said in a post. Each bullet potentially ""represents a dead American,"" wrote retired Maj. Gen. Jerry Curry, an Army vet. ""If so, why would the U.S. government want the SSA to kill 174,000 of our citizens, even during a time of civil unrest?"" Curry wrote on the conservative website The Daily Caller, founded by commentator Tucker Carlson. Conspiracy theorists had previously speculated that a purchase of hollow-point bullets by the Department of Homeland Security was similarly meant to quell impending riots. A few years ago, theorists similarly questioned why the Federal Emergency Management Agency was stockpiling body bags and other supplies, suggesting the agency was preparing for civil collapse. In the face of the furor, the Social Security Administration's public affairs shop -- which spends most of its time issuing releases about speeding disability decisions or looking up benefits information -- issued a statement explaining that its 295 agents need the bullets for target practice and to protect the agency's 66 offices across the nation. ""These investigators have full law enforcement authority, including executing search warrants and making arrests,"" the agency said in an August post. ""Our investigators are similar to your state or local police officers. They use traditional investigative techniques, and they are armed when on official duty."" Hollow point bullets are standard-issue items for many police agencies, the Social Security Administration said. The bullets expand when they hit a target and can help prevent injuries to bystanders from bullets passing through a body, according to police. Investigators ""use this ammunition during their mandatory quarterly firearms qualifications and other training sessions, to ensure agent and public safety,"" the administration added. This is just the latest in a long history of uniquely American anti-government conspiracy theories, said Kathryn Olmsted, a University of California at Davis history professor and author of ""Real Enemies: Conspiracy Theories in American Democracy."" That another one would surface in the midst of a contentious election cycle and continued unease over the nation's financial future is not all that surprising, Olmsted said Tuesday. But this one, she said, seems particularly tenuous. ""It strikes me as one of the more extreme conspiracy theories,"" Olmsted said. ""I'm surprised it has any traction."" Yet it does. ""You don't use hollow point bullets for target practice,"" one Twitter user posted Tuesday. ""Sorry we're not buying it social security agency. #youarefullofit."" By the numbers: Social Security .","Some question the Social Security Administration's recent bid request for 174,000 hollow-point bullets .

"(CNN) -- Early this week, I worked on my addiction treatment center's detoxification unit. I treated teenagers and young adults, pregnant women and medical professionals. I saw older pain patients who, having lost control over their prescriptions, began using intravenous heroin, very much to their shock. Many have developed hepatitis C and, for the first time in my state of Maine, I've begun to see an increase in HIV infections. Heroin addiction is a metastatic cultural cancer. Crime, disease, suffering and death follow in its wake. Heroin takes you down a darker road than even prescription opiate addiction. The death of Oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman on Sunday apparently proves the insidious danger of that very path. Maine is in the stranglehold of just such a transitional drug addiction epidemic -- it began in the late '90s. And we are not alone. Recent reports of mass overdose deaths in Pittsburgh and Rhode Island are strong indicators that the movement from overdose by prescription pain medication to heroin is national in scope. Interestingly, the last 20 years has seen a paradigm shift in physicians' attitudes about prescribing opioids to treat pain. Before the Federation of State Medical Boards revised its pain treatment guidelines 10 years ago, doctors tended to avoid prescribing opioids for pain. But the revised guidelines, coupled with accreditation requirements reinforcing screening for pain, and pharmaceutical industry pressure to prescribe, greatly expanded use of opioid analgesics such as Oxycontin and Vicodin. Opinion: What makes someone an addict . That ""perfect storm"" created a prescription drug addiction epidemic in our state. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration data from 10 years ago show the annual number of treatment admissions in Maine increased from a little more than 9,000 to almost 14,000 from 2002 to 2005. That same data indicated we had one of the highest rates of prescription drug addiction among adolescents and young adults in the country. We still do. It's only been recently that the rest of the country has awakened to this crisis. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called prescription drug abuse an ""epidemic."" Maine was highlighted as having one of the highest volumes of prescription painkillers sold. Is it any wonder that, with a vast, attractive market of prescription drug addicts at the ready, out-of-state heroin dealers seized the opportunity to flood Maine with their treacherous opioid drug? In only two years, heroin has saturated every remote, rural corner of our state. They say a country always fights its last war. As we donned battle gear for the war on prescription drug addiction, heroin snuck in from the flank unnoticed. Two years ago, the use of heroin exploded in Maine like a wave of napalm, incinerating lives, families and communities. Our state report on substance abuse trends for 2013 reveals that ""primary treatment admissions related to heroin or morphine have been increasing since 2010."" That means, for three years, more Mainers have been seeking treatment solely for heroin addiction. Opinion: How to stop deaths from drug ODs . Heroin is no longer only an urban plague. In his State of the State Address, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin awakened America to how heroin is corroding lives in even largely rural states. This quickly spreading opiate addiction has every addiction medicine physician deeply concerned about the pressure to treat this chronic brain disease appropriately. We must respond by providing the proven-effective treatment, combining Food and Drug Administration-approved stabilization medications with holistic rehabilitation. One without the other simply doesn't work to manage this chronic disease. Addiction disease is just like epilepsy or diabetes in that it's a lifelong diagnosis that demands lifelong management and vigilance by patients and their medical practitioners. The parents of my patients never sleep soundly, always waiting for the dreaded midnight phone call. These deaths are preventable. Treatment saves lives. Wishful thinking takes them.

"(CNN) -- In the smoggy cradle of China's industrial heartland, a heaving freight train gets set to depart along a modern incarnation of the legendary Silk Road trading route. This historic passageway was once worn into a dense chain of dusty trails by caravans of horses and camels carrying merchants and their many wares between continental Asia and Europe. Today it takes the form of a series of transnational rail tracks transporting the latest in electronic products and computer parts. Starting in the bustling mega city of Chongqing, southwest China, the 11,179-kilometer (6,946-mile) network stretches across six countries and vast unpopulated expanses all the way to Duisburg, Germany. See also: Could drones replace highways . ""The railway (goes) through Xinjiang, Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland and Germany and builds a new route for transportation,"" explained Dr Mu Huaping of the Chongqing Commission of Economy and Information Technology. ""If (the city) wants to go global, the railway serves an important role,"" Mu added. Chongqing rising . For many companies with factories in fast-growing Chongqing, transferring items via rail to markets in Europe can be easier and quicker than sea freight from one of China's coastal ports. Mu points out that train journeys take just 16 days, comparing favorably to the more lengthy shipping routes where the costs and time of transporting cargo to the coast must also be added. Since the rail network opened in 2011 (as a joint venture between track operator DB Schenker, the Chongqing Holding Group and the state railways of China, Kazakhstan and Russia) an increasing number of multinationals have taken advantage of the facility, Mu said. U.S. computer giant Hewlett Packard claims to have shipped more than 4 million notebook computers to Europe by train during this period. As more industry heads towards China's vast interior -- and cities like Chongqing expand, creating greater wealth and consumer spending power -- many observers believe rail freight will become an even more appealing cargo-transport option. See also: 7 of the most entertaining airports . ""I think it's a very bright future for freight rail transport,"" said Michael Binyon, a British journalist who has written extensively on the subject of what he tentatively refers to as the ""Iron Silk Road."" ""It's the only way to avoid the long sea routes. Airplanes are very expensive (and) road is out of the question (because) the volumes are too small."" ""Rail transportation,"" he added can be ""a very efficient way, and a fairly fast way, of moving large volumes of freight from China to Europe."" Continental shift . While this contemporary route (which plots a more northern course than its historic Silk Road counterpart) has been in operation for two years now, rail routes between Asia and Europe are far from a new development. The Trans-Siberian Railway has been shifting goods and passengers between Moscow and Vladivostok on Russia's Pacific coast for just under a century, linking up with tracks in northern China and Mongolia along the way. In time, Binyon sees the potential for even more rail integration between the continents. He points to the Marmaray tunnel project (due to open later this year) that will marry tracks underneath the Bosphorous Strait, connecting Asiatic and European Turkey in the process. See also: 8 amazing transport projects . Organizations like the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia (UNESCAP) meanwhile have long sought to facilitate a vast Trans-Asian Railway network that could link the continents. This intergovernmental project has the backing of 22 Asian nations and proposes lines that would connect Thailand, Myanmar, India, Pakistan, Iran and Turkey to southern Europe, as well as a Southeast Asian network that could theoretically extend all the way from Singapore to Europe via China. A north-south corridor stretching from Russia through Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan all the way to the Persian Gulf port of Bandar Abbas in Iran is also cited by the U.N. group as a possibility. Keeping track . When it comes to actually building these lines, however, the reality is infinitely more complex than simply plotting the routes and laying down tracks -- as the UNESCAP project has discovered since it was agreed in 2006. According to Christian Wolmar, a rail historian and author of the forthcoming book ""To the Edge of the World,"" all manner of operational challenges must first be overcome. ""Individual countries tend to use different styles, technologies, signaling systems and gauges,"" Wolmar explained. ""That means creating a link across several nations is problematic ... and incredibly expensive."" ""Then there is also the politics. Can you go through northern Turkey or Iraq or Iran? ""But that's not to say they (trains) don't have benefits. There is fantastic potential as they are a relatively green and sustainable mode of transport and can take vast loads with just a couple of people driving a train,"" he added. See also: Where is the world's best airport? Binyon also notes these difficulties but concurs with Wolmar's final point. He highlights how the Chongqing to Duisburg route has already overcome some of the standardization challenges by having cargo containers transferred to cars with new gauges at relevant border crossings to meet varying national track requirements. ""If you can simplify it, if you can unify customs agreements and if you can have a standard operating system with rules agreed by all those along the route,"" he said, then railways are ""an extremely efficient way of moving large numbers of people and freight from one population center to the other.""","A vast rail network links Chongqing in China to Duisburg in Germany .
The network has echoes of the famous Silk Road trading route .
The railway goes through China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland and Germany ."
"(CNN) -- Billy Wharton should be happy. ""Socialized health care"" is on its way. The ""socialist agenda"" is taking over America. And best of all, Barack Obama, a ""committed socialist ideologue,"" is in the Oval Office. But Wharton, co-chair of the Socialist Party USA, sees no reason to celebrate. He's seen people with bumper stickers and placards that call Obama a socialist, and he has a message for them: Obama isn't a socialist. He's not even a liberal. ""We didn't see a great victory with the election of Barack Obama,"" Wharton says, "" and we certainly didn't see our agenda move from the streets to the White House."" Are many Americans secret socialists? Obama's opponents have long described him as a socialist. But what do actual socialists think about Obama? Not much, says Wharton. ""He's the president whose main goal is to protect the wealth of the richest 5 percent of Americans."" He and others say the assertion that Obama is a socialist is absurd. ""It makes no rational sense. It clearly means that people don't understand what socialism is."" Definitions of socialism vary, but most socialists believe workers and consumers who are affected by economic institutions should own or control them. Not all socialists, though, want to confiscate personal property. Democratic Socialists are more interested in protecting ordinary people from unregulated capitalism through regulation and progressive taxation. Some of the socialist agenda is already part of American life, according to Wharton and others. Social Security, Medicare, unemployment benefits -- all reflect socialistic values, says Van Gosse, an associate professor of history at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who has researched socialist movements in the United States and Latin America. The widely accepted notions of public education and Pell Grants for college students are socialistic in origin, Gosse says. They fit well with the socialistic premise that government should provide basic security from the cradle to the grave to all of its citizens, he says. ""We assert that education should not be left up to the private market -- where those who can pay, get it and those who can't, don't get it,"" Gosse says. ""It's a common good and in that sense it is a socialistic institution even if the U.S. remains a capitalist nation."" Why socialists hate Obama's health care bill . Those who call Obama a socialist, though, point to his policies. Big on their hit list: ""Obamacare,"" which they call ""socialized medicine."" Socialists scoff at the notion. They don't applaud the passage of the recent health care bill either. They wanted a national ""single-payer"" health insurance plan with a government option. The bill that Obama championed didn't have any of those features. Wharton said the new health care bill only strengthens private health insurance companies. They get 32 million new customers and no incentive to change -- something a socialist wouldn't accept. ""Most of it was authored by the health care industry,"" Wharton says. ""I call it the corporate restructuring of health care."" Other critics point to Obama's Wall Street bailout -- which actually had its roots in the Bush administration. Critics say it's socialistic for government to assume control of private industry. Frank Llewellyn, national director of the Democratic Socialists of America, says the bailout had nothing to do with socialism. Llewellyn says a socialist leader would have at least nationalized some of the troubled banks. ""He gave them [the banks] too much with no strings attached,"" Llewellyn says. ""Banks that were too big to fail are bigger, and they can still fail."" How about Obama's bailout of the Detroit auto industry? During the bailout, the federal government assumed partial ownership of General Motors. ""It's not socialism,"" Llewellyn says. ""The mere fact that the government owns something or has a stake in it, doesn't make it socialist. If that was true, you would say that we have a socialist army. The government owns the army."" Defining socialism is complex, Llewellyn says, but it starts with a simple goal: Socialists want to introduce democratic features into the economy to reduce inequality. The economy has ""to be run for the overall benefit of the entire population, not for the benefits of a very few people."" By that measure, Obama's economic policies are not socialist, he says. ""He's trying to save capitalism from itself rather than a radical trying to change into a new system,"" Llewellyn says. This kind of name-calling is not new. Civil rights demonstrators and the politicians who passed Medicare were also called socialists and communists, Llewellyn says. ""Every time an expansion of the public's right has been put forward, Republicans have called it extreme, communistic and socialistic. It's a repeated tactic because they can't defeat the idea."" A Tea Party member explains why Obama is a socialist . Those arguments don't sway Conrad Quagliaroli, a Tea Party member who says Obama is a socialist. He says that Obama's voting record as a senator was more to the left than the U.S. Senate's sole socialist, Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He says Obama's association with radicals and his pledge to ""spread the wealth"" seal his socialistic credentials. ""The role of government is to provide a safe environment to conduct business, not to take from one and give to the other,"" says Quagliaroli, a financial planner who lives in Woodstock, Georgia. Quagliaroli was not persuaded by the arguments of other socialist leaders who reject the idea that Obama is a socialist. ""He's just not socialist enough for them."" Quagliaroli says he doesn't like socialism because it breeds mediocrity and encourages people to ""live on the dole."" Capitalism ""breeds excellence"" because it encourages initiative, he says. Does that mean that Quagliaroli will refuse his Social Security checks, a government program that has been described as socialistic, and which he opposes? Not necessarily, says Quagliaroli. He says he'll accept his Social Security checks for two reasons. ""They confiscated it from me to begin with, and the more money they give me, the less they'll have to waste,"" he says. ""I can spend it better than they can. I don't pay $500 for a hammer."" The argument over Obama's ideology may rage on, but at least one socialist says another prominent politician ought to be inserted into the debate. Llewellyn, the national director of the Democratic Socialists of America, says he was struck by one player in the 2008 presidential elections who displayed more socialistic leanings than Obama. This candidate raised taxes on the big oil companies, and sent the revenue to the people. If you want to learn something about spreading the wealth, Llewellyn says, don't look to Obama. ""To be honest, the most socialist candidate in the 2008 election was Sarah Palin.""","Obama has been called a socialist but what do actual socialists say?
Socialist leader: Obama isn't even a liberal .
Socialists say many Americans already accept socialism .
Tea Party member: Obama wants to spread the wealth ."
"(CNN) -- Any doubts that Real Madrid's big-name stars will struggle to play together this season were seemingly blown away in a remarkable 8-2 thrashing of Deportivo la Coruna on Saturday. World player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick, last year's marquee signing Gareth Bale netted twice and recently-arrived World Cup star James Rodriguez was also on the scoresheet in the Spanish top-flight match. Mexico striker Javier Hernandez, a loan signing from Manchester United, grabbed the final two goals after coming on as a late substitute. It was the first time the club has scored eight goals in an away La Liga match, and the winning margin matched the 7-1 success at Real Zaragoza in the 1987-88 season. ""We showed the quality we have. We have a phenomenon in Ronaldo and we have other players with great quality,"" coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. ""They combined very well together and that was the best thing we can take from the game."" Ancelotti's team made an impressive start to its European Champions League title defense in midweek, beating Basel 5-1, but the club's early domestic form has been patchy. This victory, after a win and two defeats, left Madrid three points behind big rival Barcelona, which travels to bottom club Levante on Sunday seeking to maintain a 100% record. City rival Atletico Madrid, which won the Spanish title last season but lost to Real in the European final, dropped points in a 2-2 draw at home to Celta Vigo later Saturday. ""The season is very long and recovering points on the leaders just now isn't the problem,"" Ancelotti added. ""We have to improve. Today we showed the quality everyone knows we have which is the capability to score in many different ways. ""We need to continue improving the balance and our consistency. After two defeats we have scored 13 goals and that is a good sign that we have responded well."" Ronaldo, who netted against Swiss side Basel on Tuesday, scored his 23rd hat-trick for Real since joining in a then world-record $130 million move from English club Manchester United. Rodriguez, who won the golden boot as top scorer at Brazil 2014 before joining Real for a reported $121 million from Monaco, then scored his second goal in a week as he curled in a superb left-foot effort. Ronaldo made it 3-0 before halftime but Deportivo pulled a goal back after the break with a penalty after Sergio Ramos was ruled to have handled the ball. Bale -- whose move from Tottenham last year eclipsed the Portugal captain's transfer fee -- took center stage with two well-taken goals. Deportivo, which had conceded only four times in three previous games, went 6-1 down as Ronaldo sealed his treble from Rodriguez's pass before Toche headed a consolation. Hernandez, who replaced Bale, fired in a left-foot volley from the edge of the area and then added another long-range effort -- this one deflecting into the net off a defender. Atletico conceded an early goal to Pablo Hernandez but led 2-1 at halftime through Miranda and defender Diego Godin before Nolito leveled with a 53rd-minute penalty. The draw left Diego Simeone's team a point behind Barca in second, with Granada third on goal difference after winning 1-0 at Athletic Bilbao. Italy . Three-time defending champion Juventus secured a third win from three this season, as Argentina striker Carlos Tevez scored the only goal at AC Milan on Saturday. The 71st-minute decider gave coach Massimiliano Allegri a notable victory over the club that sacked him in January. It left Milan in second after a first defeat this Serie A season, while Roma can join Juve on three wins from three by beating Cagliari on Sunday. Germany . Bundesliga champion Bayern Munich was held 0-0 at second-bottom Hamburg on Saturday, leaving Pep Guardiola's team fourth on goal difference after a second draw in four matches. Promoted Paderborn, which travels to Bayern's Allianz Arena on Tuesday, is top after a 2-0 win over Hanover that was capped by a spectacular late volley by Moritz Stoppelkamp from just outside his own penalty area. The top four teams all have eight points after second-placed Mainz upset last season's runner-up Borussia Dortmund 2-0 and Hoffenheim, in third, won by the same score at Stuttgart. France . Marseille went top on goal difference after Saturday's 3-0 win over Rennes, as France forward Andre-Pierre Gignac scored twice. It put Marseille above Bordeaux, which won 2-1 against bottom side Evian Thonon Gaillard on Friday. Sixth-placed defending champion Paris St. Germain hosts Lyon on Sunday, when Lille could go top by beating Montpellier.","Cristiano Ronaldo nets a hat-trick as Real Madrid scores eight goals .

"(CNN) -- The doorbell rings. You answer it and find a long-dead loved one at your front door, apparently come back to life and looking just the same as the day they died. How would you react? That's the idea behind Jason Mott's debut novel, ""The Returned."" In the hands of an author such as Stephen King or Dean Koontz, this could be the start of something scary, but this is no zombie tale. Inspired by a dream in which his late mother visits him, Mott tells a personal story about one family caught up in a worldwide event. ""The Returned"" is set in a small Mississippi town and focuses on an elderly couple, Harold and Lucille Hargraves. A government agent shows up at their home with the couple's son, who drowned on his eighth birthday 50 years ago. Jacob looks and acts the same but how could this be the Hargraves' son? Obviously, the couple is much older and has tried to move on. How will this little boy fit into their lives now or be accepted in their community? Jacob is one of thousands being reunited with families all over the world. Initially there's elation, then fear and eventually hysteria. Are these ""Returned"" a miracle or a sign of the end times? Mott was almost unknown before ""The Returned,"" but critics and advance readers are calling his first novel ""eloquent"" and ""elegiac,"" also ""haunting"" and ""heart wrenching."" Brad Pitt's ""Plan B"" entertainment snapped up the rights and is already shooting a TV series based on the novel. Entertainment Weekly recently listed him as one of their 10 ""New Hollywood: Next Wave"" people to watch. As his first novel hits shelves, Mott, who lives in rural North Carolina, says he's terrified and excited by his newfound fame. Fast facts: Jason Mott . Age: 35 . Hometown: Born and raised in Bolton, North Carolina, a small town of less than 700 people and one traffic light in the eastern part of the state near the coast. For fans of: Magical realism, British author Neil Gaiman and readers who enjoyed Stephen King's ""The Green Mile."" What else he has written: Mott is the author of two previous poetry collections, ""We Call This Thing Between Us Love"" and ""...hide behind me..."" Before he was a novelist: Mott worked for several years as a customer service representative for Verizon Wireless, fielding complaints in New York from angry customers. Five questions with Jason Mott . CNN: What was the idea behind ""The Returned?"" Mott: It actually started with a dream I had about my mother. Both of my parents have passed away, my mother in 2001 and my father in 2007. In the summer of 2010, I had this dream that I came home from work one day and found my mother sitting at the kitchen table waiting for me. I came in and sat down with her, and we just talked about everything that had happened since her death. My going to college, friends that I'd met, it was this warm kind of cathartic dream where I was able to be with my mother again for the first time in almost a decade. It was one of these really vivid dreams where you wake up and question whether it was real or not. I really expected to find her sitting on the couch when I came out of my bedroom but of course she wasn't. That dream stuck with me, I couldn't get it out of my head. I was talking to a friend of mine who's also a writer and we discussed it, at some point in the conversation he said: What if that really happened and what if it wasn't just her? I wrote a short story not long after about a couple whose son returns. I did a reading and the crowd really seemed to respond to it. People came up afterward and said how it reminded them of people they had lost. So after seeing that strong reaction, I started writing and about a year later, I had a manuscript on my hands. It's still kind of hard to believe how it all happened, but it's been a lot of fun and I feel really special about it. CNN: This could have been a horror story, but you took a much different approach. Why? Mott: I tried to make the story as grounded as I could because I felt it was such a difficult topic to approach. When I was working on the manuscript I talked to a lot of my friends, their parents, people that I knew, asking them what they would do if someone they loved who had passed away suddenly showed up again. The responses were really interesting. Usually people were very excited to hear about it, saying they would love to have so and so back, that it would be a really wonderful moment. Then I would follow up with what would happen a year later, is it still just as exciting and wonderful? Sometimes the answers became really complicated. You had people who had changed dramatically since their loved one had passed away. I'm not the same person as I was when my mother passed in 2001. I was 22 years old then, now I'm a 35-year-old adult. It's two completely different mindsets. So as much as I love her still, I'm much different now and that could create some friction. There were other people who had similar answers who had moved forward in life. That was the thing I tried most to carry into the novel, to be as realistic as possible. CNN: What's behind the recent fascination in books, TV and movies with the undead? Mott: It's the ultimate mystery: What happens after we die? If people are coming back, what does that mean to our beliefs? The whole genre revolves around that idea as well as the emotional impact of someone you've let go of suddenly thrust back into the equation. So how do you react to it? On a national level and on a personal level, I think it's everyone really trying to understand life and who they are versus people who have passed away. I think there's a lot of self-exploration going on right now. CNN: Your book is now being turned into a TV series. How is that going? Mott: It's going really well. I don't have much direct involvement, which I'm actually very glad about since things are so busy right now. I made a deal with Plan B, Brad Pitt's film company, and they brought in a wonderful writer, Aaron Zelman, who worked on AMC's ""The Killing,"" and they're doing a great job. They're filming outside Atlanta right now. I've had a chance to meet the cast, and they're all really excited. I had a chance to see the pilot, and I like what they're doing with it. It's a little bit surreal, seeing the actors playing these characters who've I had close to my heart. It's like being outside of yourself for a moment. It's almost like sending a child out into the world. It's been fascinating, fun and a little bit scary at times. With all authors when you option the rights to your work, there's a little bit of nervousness over what will happen to it, how will it come out? But once I saw the pilot, it was so well-done, I'm really excited about it. CNN: What kind of response have you had from people who've read the book? Mott: Many of them will come up to me and talk about someone they lost that this reminded them of. Once they finished the book, they got a photo album out and looked at photos they hadn't thought about in a long time because the book really made them remember that person and brought to the forefront all the good times they had with that person. To me, this is the most rewarding part. That's what I wanted the book to do. It came from a very personal place for me, so I wanted the readers to have a personal experience as well. I didn't want it to be just my story. I also wanted it to remind you to really value the time you have with someone who's here now and realize how precious this time is. If the book can do that for anyone, then I'm happy with it.","Jason Mott says vivid dream about his dead mother inspired him to write ""The Returned""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Clint Eastwood doesn't know if he's a legend. Clint Eastwood attends the ""Gran Torino"" premiere this month with actors Bee Vang, left, and Ahney Her. ""Maybe, what is it?"" he asks, before making a reference to a line from director John Ford's ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" ""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."" But for more than 50 years, he's appeared on the screen and behind the camera. His film credits include ""Dirty Harry,"" ""Every Which Way But Loose"" and the three ""Man With No Name"" Westerns. He owns four Oscars -- two for direction of ""Unforgiven"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" and best picture wins for those two films -- and he's been nominated for six others. His most recent contribution to the film world is ""Gran Torino."" In the film, which Eastwood also directed, he stars as Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran who is forced by immigrant neighbors to challenge his prejudices. Kowalski is a recognizable type, the gruff, sometimes bigoted old man who may be hiding more heart than he lets on. Even though he's not too caring at the start, ""he ends up expressing love to a family he's never known before,"" Eastwood said. CNN talked with Eastwood, 78, about the movie, his future as an actor and what he expects in terms of awards. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: When you read the script, were you at all concerned about the nature of the language? Clint Eastwood: No, I wasn't. If you're going to learn something and progress in the movie as a character, you have to start as something else in order to learn tolerance. And your character obviously is never too old to learn that, so he has to be a certain way. But I -- being politically incorrect -- I find [it] fascinating because I hate the so-called PC thing. I think that's one of the things that's damaging our generation at the present time. Everybody is taking themselves and everything so seriously. If they just relax a little more and take themselves and everything else a little less seriously, they'd have a lot more fun. CNN: I understand Nick [Schenk] was the original screenplay writer. Boy, did he get a grand slam, getting Clint Eastwood to sign onto his project. Eastwood: Well, it was interesting because he had a hard time getting it to us for some reason. Anyway, they did and finally they got it to Rob Lorenz, who's my associate. And he read it and said, ""Well, it's kind of interesting. You might find this character interesting."" He says, ""He's got a lot of -- he's kind of a racist -- he's a little bit of a lot of things."" I said, ""Well, it sounds interesting, I'll read it."" You know, he said the same thing you're saying. He said, ""It's not exactly politically correct."" I said, ""Perfect. Let me read it. I'll read it tonight."" CNN: It's great that after doing so many films in your long career, you're still looking for that edgy material. The material that's not quite in the box obviously. And I heard that you don't know if you'll be doing too much acting anymore? Eastwood: I don't think so. I just don't think there's going to be that many good roles, or as you say, edgy material. CNN: Maybe not edgy material for the typical senior that's an actor, but you're a legend. You're Clint Eastwood. So I'm thinking people are writing stuff for you. Eastwood: I'll tell you why. It's that I do enjoy being behind the camera. I started directing 38 years ago in order to be involved in the whole project and not just the one component of acting. And so it became interesting to me to look at the whole picture. And so I'm enjoying it back there. And next picture I do, Morgan [Freeman]'s going to be upfront and I'm going to be behind the camera. And that's where, I think, where I belong. CNN: And you guys are shooting that film [about Nelson Mandela] in South Africa? Eastwood: Yeah. CNN: You guys are buddies now. Eastwood: Well, this will be our third together film over the years. The other two films [""Unforgiven"" and ""Million Dollar Baby""] seem to be reasonably successful, so we just hope we can keep a trend. CNN: You've got ""Changeling,"" and then you've got ""Gran Torino."" Both of them are getting a lot of buzz. What's your reaction to the fact that you'll probably be getting a lot of [award] nominations? Eastwood: Oh, I don't know about that. I don't think about that. I just make the pictures and where they fall is where they fall. If somebody likes them, that's always nice. And if they don't like them, then too bad. It's just you -- you just make this picture. Actually, I kind of make a film for myself to sort of express myself. Or it's a story I might want to follow. I never think too much about anybody seeing it. And then when you're done with it, you go, ""Oh my God. Now we got to see if anybody wants to see this thing."" So we're at that period right now, at least on ""Gran Torino.""

"(CNN) -- Finding stability in my life has been a problem. I grew up on the 500 block of Lincoln Heights in Washington. When I was 1 month old, my mother abandoned me. She left me with a man whom I grew up to call my father. I was left with this man so that he could take care of me. Instead, he paid other people to take care of me. He came around as much as he could to spend quality time with me, whether it was going to a park, going out for dinner or reading at the library. He tried with all his might to be there for me. But I soon began living in a real nightmare. My childhood was rough. Oftentimes I felt alone, depressed. I even battled with thoughts of committing suicide because I felt no one really cared for me. There were nights when I ran away from the homes that had taken me in. I would go for walks and just cry because I didn't understand what I did wrong to deserve this childhood. When I was 10, I began to receive negative vibes about my living situation. I called my father and asked if he could pick me up and remove me from the home in which I was staying. The next day, my nightmare became a reality. I was shot. As I slept on the couch, my caretaker's grandson discharged a 12-gauge shotgun. The pellets fired through the wall and accidentally hit me in my spinal cord and right shoulder. All of a sudden, I couldn't really move my right shoulder. I thought my life would be over soon. This is not what I wanted. I sat there bleeding, convinced that my time on earth would be cut short. My surroundings led me to think that I would become a victim of my own nightmare. I believed that this was the last day of my life because I couldn't survive the way I was living. Thankfully, I made it to hospital, and even though I was fading in and out, I survived. During my time in the hospital, I had to learn to walk again and move my right shoulder, which was temporally paralyzed. I was discharged from the hospital and sent to live with someone else who my father thought was able to take care of me. Two weeks after staying in that household, I was placed in the District's foster care system. I was labeled a neglect case. Even though I was finally getting help, I felt even more alone after being taken away from my father. Years later, my mother would be found, only to turn down the opportunity to take custody of me. Two years after I was shot, the only person who ever cared for me died of cancer. At that moment, I lost the one person who meant the world to me, my father, Thomas McRae Sr. A DNA test later proved that the man that I thought was my father really wasn't. Eventually I would be placed at the Boys Town group home in Washington under the leadership of Hubert and Chauna Geter, who revealed to me what the meaning of true love, patience and nourishment truly means. Because of their support I began to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I lived in a total of 22 households before I was adopted by my close friend's mom, Joi Morris. That's when I knew that everything in my life was supposed to happen. I realized that you have to go through hell to find heaven. This summer, I had the pleasure of interning on Capitol Hill under Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland for the Congressional Coalition on Adoptions Institute's Foster Youth Internship Program. For the first time in my life, I spent two months around people who had battled what I battled and was overcome by their testimony. Now I want to share my experiences with the world and help out anyone who is, or was, like me. I also feel the responsibility to give back to the city that birthed me, Washington, and I vow to do exactly that.","Thomas McRae lived in 22 different homes after being abandoned by his parents .
