"A single mother with eight children who receives £2,000 a month in state handouts has complained she is struggling to make ends meet. Marie Buchan, 31, whose children range in age from 12 to two months, lives in a three-bedroom housing association house in Selly Oak, Birmingham, but says it's not big enough and has applied for a bigger one. And she says her benefits payments, which were reduced from £582 a week to £500 a week in September after the government introduced a cap on handouts, are not enough for her family to survive on. Fined: Marie Buchan, 31, from Selly Oak in Birmingham, claims £2,000 a month in benefits and has had a string of bus lane fines slashed because she could not afford to pay them . Home: The semi-detached three-bedroom house in Selly Oak, Birmingham, where Miss Buchan lives . Now Miss Buchan, who is £2,000 in arrears with her rent, says she fears she may be evicted after falling behind with her rent. She said: 'The benefit cap has hit me hard - money is very tight.  I am £82-a-week worse off and, when you have eight children, every penny counts. 'I don’t waste my money - everything goes on my children. It is tough bringing up eight children on your own, a constant battle. 'I feel the threat of eviction all the time. I have already been to court once due to rent arrears and I fear I may be dragged there again. 'I am scrimping and saving to try to get the arrears down but it is very difficult.' Miss Buchan's financial problems are compounded by the fact that she owes £600 in bus lane fines after receiving ten tickets for straying in bus lanes in Birmingham city centre in three days. Miss Buchan, pictured with her eight children aged two months to 12 years, has run up bus fines of £600 . Bus lane fine: Miss Buchan owes £600 in penalty charges after she was caught in bus lanes ten times in three days . She says she was caught in bus lanes while looking for a parking space when taking her baby, Olivia, to hopsital for treatment for bronchiolitis. Miss Buchan, a tenant of Bourneville Village Trust in the south-west of Birmingham, used to receive £385 a week in child tax credit, £100 child benefit and £97 income support. But the benefits cap, introduced earlier this year by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to reduce the burden on the state, limited her handouts to £500 a week. 'The benefits cap sets a fair limit to what people can expect to get from the welfare system. 'Claimants cannot receive more than £500 a week, the average household earnings.' - DWP spokesman . Miss Buchan, whose relationship with her former partner and father of all her children ended this year, has children Tia, 12, Leah, 11, Latoya, eight, Joshua, seven, Alisha, five, Mikayla, three, Amelia, two, and two-month-old Olivia. She sleeps with three of her children in one bedroom of her £200,000 semi, while another four share a second room and Joshua has the third to himself. She was on the waiting list for a four-bedroom home but has been removed from the list after falling behind with her rent. A DWP spokesman said: 'The benefit cap sets a fair limit to what people can expect to get from the welfare system. 'Claimants cannot receive more than £500 a week, the average household earnings. 'We have been working with claimants for 18 months to help them prepare for the cap. 'Already 18,000 people potentially affected have been helped into work, as those receiving working tax credits are exempt.' Bournville Village Trust spokesman said: 'It is normal policy for social housing landlords not to transfer households to larger properties when there are rent arrears, especially of this level.' Dramatic cuts: ain Duncan Smith introduced the benefits capping legislation earlier this year . The benefits cap was introduced after politicians discovered that some families were being given the equivalent of a £70,000 annual salary. It limited what people could claim to £500 a week, or £26,000 a year.  This is equivalent to an annual income of £34,000 before tax, similar to the income of many nurses or teachers. Work and Pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith brought in the cost-cutting legislation, designed to reduce the burden on the State, this July. So far, 19,300 households have been affected by the benefits cap.  By the end of next month, it is expected that 40,000 families will have had their benefits capped. The DWP estimates that the radical reforms have led to 36,000 people trying to find work rather than live on benefits. The annual national welfare bill was £208billion.","Marie Buchan, 31, lives with her children aged from two months to 12 years .

"Questions have been raised over the delay in the arrival of an ambulance to treat critically injured batsman Phil Hughes at the Sydney Cricket Ground. A day after the 25-year-old was struck by a bouncer bowled by New South Wales' Sean Abbott, there have been conflicting reports about when an ambulance was called and when one arrived on Tuesday. SCG officials confirmed on Wednesday they had called for an ambulance about six minutes after Hughes collapsed face first on the pitch, not 14 minutes as initially reported earlier on the same day. That it took 23 minutes to arrive at the ground has raised serious concerns about the responsiveness of the NSW Ambulance service, prompting state Health Minister Jillian Skinner to demand an explanation from the ambulance commissioner, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reports. WARNING: Some pictures and video in this story may be distressing . Phillip Hughes was critically injured during South Australia's match against New South Wales at Sydney . The batsman was struck in the head by a bouncer from Sean Abbott, which led to a brain haemorrhage . Australian coach Darren Lehmann (right) and Aaron Finch leave St Vincent's Hospital after visiting Hughes .

Shane Watson and wife Lee Furlong also visited Hughes, where his family is maintaining a bedside vigil . Cricketers Matthew Wade (left) and his wife Julia (right) arrive with Australian batsman Aaron Finch (centre) Horrified onlookers, including Hughes' mother and sister, at SCG witnessed Hughes felling to the ground at 2.23pm on Tuesday as players rushed to his side to help him out. In photographs, they are seen gesturing to officials, asking them to phone emergency services. 2.23pm: Phil Hughes is hit by a bouncer bowled by Sean Abbott and falls to the ground . 2.29pm: Sydney Cricket Ground staff raise the alarm and phone triple-0 for an ambulance . 2.37pm: Another call is made to NSW Ambulance . 2.44pm: An ambulance that responded to the second call for help arrives at SCG . 2.52pm: The ambulance responding to the first call made 23 minutes ago finally arrives at the scene . On Wednesday morning, NSW Ambulance said it did not receive a triple-0 call until 2.37pm, but later clarified the first call was made by ground staff at 2.29pm. The confusion appears to have come about because the ambulance that responded to the 2.37pm call arrived first at the SCG at 2.44pm. The ambulance called out at 2.29pm did not arrive until 2.52pm, NSW Ambulance said. 'A doctor provided treatment to the patient until paramedics arrived and assisted in stabilising him,' NSW Ambulance chief executive Commissioner Ray Creen said in a statement. A helicopter, with a specialist doctor and paramedic on board, as well as another road ambulance were also dispatched. St Vincent's Hospital was identified as the closest hospital, and road the fastest and safest route. Cardiologist Dr Ross Walker said he had 'no idea whatsoever' why it took six minutes for the first triple-0 call to be made. 'You could see he staggered for a few seconds then went flat down, completely unconscious - that should have prompted a call to the ambulance immediately,' Dr Walker told The Today Show. 'One of the things we say in medicine is that ""time is tissue"" and the longer you wait to treat any acute injury or acute problem, the more tissue is damaged. 'And that's clearly the case here, because there was a time delay he's had now very severe brain injuries.' But Dr Walker said Hughes might have sustained the same injuries regardless of response time. 'Because by the look of it he was cracked in the back of the skull over a place called the cerebellum, which is very close to the brain stem, and the brain stems a really important place for vital things like breathing and consciousness,' he said. 'And so if you get swelling into that area straight away and you rupture an artery and bleed into the area the brain stem can actually be compressed down through what we can the foramen magnum into the spinal cord which is where all this sort of stuff happens.' Dr Walker added that he believed the ambulance took so long to arrive because ambulance services are overstretched. Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust defended its handling of the incident. 'SCG Trust staff followed the venue's emergency management plan quickly, calmly and professionally, as did staff from Cricket NSW and the NSW Ambulance Service,' communications director Phil Heads said. Phil Hughes, 25, remains in a critical condition at St Vincent's Hospital at Darlinghurst - in Sydney's inner-city . Hughes was put in an induced coma at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital but tragically died on Thursday. Royal Prince Alfred Hospital neurosurgeon Dr Brindha Shivalingam told Sydney's Daily Telegraph time was of the essence when it came to injuries of all kinds but it was even more integral when it came to swelling on the brain. She said the best thing for that was for paramedics to get the patient to the hospital as soon as possible. 'If there is a blood clot that has been created by an injury it will cause significant pressure on the brain, which is what causes death and injury,' Dr Shivalingam said. 'Unless that is relieved quickly your chances of recovery are slim.' Health Minister Skinner will meet with the ambulance commissioner on Thursday over the delays. 'Due to the conflicting information distributed today [Wednesday] by NSW Ambulance regarding yesterday's [Tuesday's] response to the Sydney Cricket Ground, I will be meeting with NSW Ambulance Commissioner Ray Creen tomorrow [Thursday] to discuss the circumstances surrounding the incident,' she said. Doctors say the minutes after he was hit with a cricket ball were crucial as paramedics need to get patients to a hospital as soon as possible if they have a brain injury . 'My thoughts remain with Phillip Hughes and his family, who I know are receiving the very best care at St Vincent's Hospital.' This came as friends and family were seen flooding into the hospital where Hughes was staying on Wednesday while his relatives maintained a bedside vigil, awaiting any changes in his condition. On Wednesday, relatives including his brother Jason who introduced him to the sport, were joined at Hughes' bedside by close friend and Australia’s team captain Michael Clarke. The national skipper returned to the hospital about 7am on Wednesday morning after spending seven hours supporting Hughes in the intensive care unit on Tuesday night. Clarke left the hospital at 10.20am and appeared downcast as he walked to the carpark with sunglasses on and his hands in his pockets. He drove away in a white Lexus sedan. Fellow teammate Brad Haddin spent 40 minutes with the fallen batsman, coming out visibly distressed.

"Sergio Aguero could have signed for Bayern Munich back in 2006 but the club and then-coach Felix Magath decided the player was too lazy. Aguero tormented Pep Guardiola's Bayern side on Tuesday night, his hat-trick leading Manchester City to a late 3-2 victory in the Champions League. But the Argentina striker may well have been playing for the German team had history taken a slightly different course. VIDEO Scroll down for Watch a 16-year-old Sergio Aguero score a stunning solo goal . Sergio Aguero could have sealed a move to Bayern Munich back in 2006, when he was 17 . Manchester City striker Aguero celebrates scoring the winner against Bayern on Tuesday night . Bayern first team coach Felix Magath felt the 17-year-old was too lazy and that his time scouting was wasted . Bayern were one of the first European teams to investigate signing Aguero in 2006, when the then 17-year-old was playing for Buenos Aires side Independiente, the Munich press reminded readers on Wednesday. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge tried to push through a deal . Resigned to selling Aguero, the Argentinian club were demanding £12million, a fee which Bayern's then general manager Uli Hoeness was reluctant to pay. Bayern, for all their big spending, have always made a point of not being held to ransom by other clubs. Hoeness' colleague Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, however, attempted to push the deal through, arguing that, 'he (Aguero) wouldn't be a bargain, but he is very talented. 'We need to get in before the Italians and the Spaniards, otherwise it will be seriously expensive'. Hoeness thus attended an Independiente game during a trip to Argentina, but remained unconvinced by Aguero's work rate. In an interview with SportBild in 2011, the Bayern boss said: 'His team mates were warming up, and Aguero was just leaning on the fence. The only thing he did in the whole game was to win and score a penalty'. Those words may have come back to haunt Hoeness, now in prison for tax evasion, as he saw Aguero win and score a penalty for Manchester City against Bayern. Rather than the £12m being demanded for  Aguero, Hoeness made an offer of £4m, and was laughed off by Independiente. Still unsure, Hoeness then decided to send Bayern's first team coach at the time, none other than Fulham flop Magath, to see what he thought of Aguero. After flying to South America and watching one match, Magath came back immensely frustrated. Aguero has gone on to become one of the best strikers in world football but wasn't worth £12m in 2006 . 'Never waste my free time again', he told Hoeness, 'it's too precious to watch a player who does nothing but stand around for the whole game'. Thus Bayern's verdict was complete. Aguero, who would later sign for Atletico Madrid, and of course Manchester City, was too lazy, too expensive, and not gifted enough for Bayern Munich. Signing him at the age of 17 would have been too risky, and potentially harmful to the club. Eight years later, it turns out that Hoeness and Magath were right. Aguero did hurt Bayern after all.","Sergio Aguero could have moved to Bayern Munich in 2006 for £12m .

"Paul McGrath found himself shouting in despair at the TV set - Manchester United had let in yet another soft goal. He tweeted: ‘Going to try to get myself fit and back into that defence!’ It was a tongue-in-cheek remark from the 54-year-old but how Louis van Gaal must wish for a player of McGrath’s calibre today. Indeed, so must half of the Premier League. McGrath is widely revered as one of the greatest defenders to play the game. His United captain Bryan Robson described him as a ‘Rolls-Royce of a player’ who just happened to need a jump-start on occasions. These days, McGrath’s toughest opponent is the bottle. His much publicised battle with alcohol was described in all too harrowing detail in a candid autobiography, Back From The Brink. VIDEO Scroll down for Tyler Blackett scores with thunderbolt free-kick in FA Youth Cup . Paul McGrath speaks with fondness of his playing days at Manchester United, the club he still loves . The battle is ongoing but it is over a year since his last lapse and there is a sense of serenity in McGrath’s life. 'Roy is a very funny man and a good friend. I have huge respect for him as a fabulous footballer and a human being. He was a pleasure to play alongside (with Ireland) because he made us a better team. He was born to be in football. His partnership with Martin O’Neill is working and I see a team spirit that, dare I say, reminds me of when I was part of the squad. I know Aston Villa and Ireland would be poorer if he wasn’t there.' Home is now in picturesque Wexford in Ireland where ‘the fishing is good and golf not so bad’ and, despite the temptations placed in front of him by well-wishers, his focus is firmly set on United’s home match with Hull City on Saturday. Buoyed by their win at Arsenal, McGrath believes it could prove the making of United’s painfully raw defence. ‘Let’s be honest, they got out of jail,’ he says in his Irish lilt. ‘At times against Arsenal it was like the Keystone Cops — they were hacking it clear when they should have been brave and passed it. ‘They were so nervous, but then I thought, “You’re doing the right thing, take no chances”. They sensed Arsenal had missed their opportunity. Young Paddy McNair relaxed and grew into the game and Chris Smalling seemed to relish the responsibility of being the senior defender. In the end, for a young defence, it should have done them a world of good.’ McGrath says young Paddy McNair (left) relaxed against Arsenal and grew into the game . McGrath says Chris Smalling is relishing being the senior defender as United battle injury woes . McGrath’s affection for his old club - where he played from 1982-89 - is clear. ‘I’d love to be playing,’ he says. ‘I used to enjoy games against Arsenal. They were the top team in the South and the way they used to strut around we didn’t much like. It was our other grudge match after Liverpool. If you went in for a 50-50 it was important in our day to not show you were hurt. They called Stuart ‘Psycho’ and it was easy to see why. There was a 50-50 to be won at Wembley once - and it had to be him I was facing. When we collided the pain shot through my knee. I knew my knee was wrecked but I got up because I didn’t want to show it had hurt. It was killing me. I only hope he was sore, too, but he didn’t show it. ‘If you were going to win things you had to beat them and we were always looking to lay down a marker. That would normally come from Norman Whiteside. He wasn’t afraid of anyone and it wasn’t always about the football. He’d just hope it was in the vicinity when he was ready to tackle. ‘The physical nature, that competition, was all part of it. I loved it. Now when I say I’d like to play, I would but I’m not so sure I’d be on the pitch for long before I got a red card.’ As McGrath’s knees testify, he played in an era when tackling was expected and he cringes at the way football has become less of a contact sport. He believes this is partly to blame for many of the errors made by United’s defenders. ‘Tackling is being taken out of the game,’ he says. ‘The slightest touch on the back of a striker or clip of the heel and it’s a yellow card. It means the defender is worried about a red straight away. Now a defender has to stay on his feet and anticipate more than compete.' Bobby Robson called McGrath a 'Rolls-Royce of a player' who needed an occasional jump start . ‘I found that part of my game came as I got older. Being a good interceptor comes with age and experience. United’s players haven’t got that yet. ‘Old Trafford can be a horrible, unforgiving place to learn. When I see Tyler Blackett, he looks so smooth he could become a real gem but it’s whether they give him the leeway to develop. Everyone wants results now and pressure comes with that, which makes you nervous and leads to mistakes. I made countless mistakes but I was allowed to grow.’ United are searching for new defenders but McGrath believes a good one will be hard to find. ‘They need experience but there’s not many top-quality defenders that clubs will sell. ‘Vincent Kompany is a great leader, Mats Hummels is similar but United aren’t the only ones with money any more. It may be better to nurture Phil Jones, McNair, Blackett and Smalling because they can grow into better than what is in the market. McGrath says young United defender Tyler Blackett 'looks so smooth he could become a real gem' But he fears Blackett (right tracking Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain) won't get the time he needs . ‘They would hate me for saying it but Aston Villa have Ron Vlaar, who could help United with his experience and bring on the younger players but, at the same time, I want him to stay at Villa.’ John Fashanu of Wimbledon would smash my teeth in and others liked a tussle but Liverpool’s Ian Rush was horrible. He wouldn’t give you any peace. There was a time when goalkeepers would roll you the ball and you’d take a touch and try to look composed but Ian would come tearing at you with such speed you’d think, ‘Oh Lord, am I going to have time to take this touch?’ You’d be afraid he’d catch you and you’d make a mistake. Luckily, he never scored against me but it wasn’t comfortable. United’s cause has been sorely hindered by injuries this season. The club once tried to persuade McGrath to retire at the age of 29 before he gained a new lease of life with the help of Villa physio Jim Walker and carried on playing until 37. He says modern footballers are not prepared to go through pain as much as players of his era. ‘There are too many advising players what to do and I think some have lost sight of who they are playing for. I remember Bryan Robson breaking his leg and he was itching to get back. In his first game, he went into a crunching 50-50 challenge full-blooded to test his leg. It was stupid in many ways but Bryan believed he was putting his body on the line for the club and fans who paid his wages. ‘I’m not sure you’d get that today. We wanted to play. We cared more about United than being injured.’ McGrath says there are too many people advising players these days and forgotten what they're playing for . Aston Villa's Ron Vlaar could help United with his experience but McGrath wants him to stay at Villa Park . McGrath’s appreciation of being a professional footballer was all the sweeter after an apprenticeship spent making iron gates. He was 22 when United picked him up - ‘I felt like the luckiest man in the world,’ he says. The reverence in which he is held by the fans provides its own pitfalls, though. When McGrath goes to watch his beloved Ireland, he is often asked if he would like a drink. ‘I’m sure there are players with similar problems,’ he reasons. ‘That’s the boundaries in my life. I still have some good friends who ring when I need it, it’s one day at a time. It’s challenging but hopefully I’m winning.’ One thing certain about Paul McGrath, he is up for a challenge.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's never-ending injury problems plummeted to new low after losing two more players. The Gunners secured their passage into the Champions League group stages with a 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund - but their glee was tempered by injuries to captain Mikel Arteta (calf) and Yaya Sanogo (hamstring). 'The injury situation is a problem because we have many games,' said Wenger. Mikel Arteta injured his calf muscle during the second half of Arsenal's win over Borussia Dortmund . Arteta immediately signalled to the bench to confirm he was injured and would need to be taken off . Arteta looks in pain as he hobbles after picking up a calf injury . Arteta and Sanogo will be assessed at the club's London Colney HQ on Thursday to establish the prognosis. But the Spaniard's loss will spark a change in transfer strategy from the Gunners when the January window re-opens. Jack Wilshere's ankle injury had already forced Wenger into rethinking his transfer plans. Yaya Sanogo scored Arsenal's first goal against Borussia Dortmund at the Emirates on Wednesday night . Sanogo (second right) also had to come off injured himself, later in the game . The Arsenal manager is still prioritising the capture of at least two central defenders; a position the Gunners have been dreadfully short this season. But, even prior to Wednesday night, Wenger is also now looking to sign a central midfielder to replace Wilshere - who could be out for four months if he needs surgery on his injured left ankle. Bayer Leverkusen's Lars Bender remains Wenger's dream signing, but Sportsmail understands they are also showing an interest in Sevilla's Grzegorz Krychowiak, who could be cheaper option. Their defensive targets include Celtic's Virgil van Dijk, Manchester United's Chris Smalling and Ipswich left-back Tyrone Mings. But Arteta's injury will only heighten Wenger's desire to sign a new central midfielder when the window re-opens. Sanogo celebrates scoring his first goal for Arsenal - before picking up a hamstring injury . Arsenal expect to discover whether or not Wilshere will require surgery when he sees a specialist. Arteta, Sanogo and Wilshere join an already lengthy Arsenal injury list. Danny Welbeck (knee), Mesut Ozil (knee), Wojciech Szczesny (hip), Mathieu Debuchy (ankle), Theo Walcott (groin) and David Ospina (thigh) all missed the clash through injury. Despite the setbacks, Arsenal produced a fine 2-0 win against Dortmund to confirm their place in the last 16 of the Champions League. On his side's 15th consecutive qualification for the Champions League knockout stages, Wenger added: 'When you work at the football club we realise it's not easy to have that continuity and consistency and I'm very proud of that. 'The club deserves a lot of credit for that. But it's not enough, we want more than that. 'The focus to defend well together. We had a similar game to Saturday (a 2-1 defeat to Manchester United) but we focused really well. It was a committed game, and maybe defensively we were better tonight. 'We have done our job. We want now to focus on the Premier League and to wait now for who we get in the draw.'","Arsenal produced a fine performance to beat Borussia Dortmund 2-0 .

"Luis Suarez scored his first goal for Barcelona and in doing so opened the way for Lionel Messi to rewrite the history books once again, with a hat-trick that took him past Raul as the Champions League all-time top-scorer. Barça were struggling to break down a stubborn APOEL defence when Suarez spun away from his marker and buried a shot into the far corner of Urko Pardo's net after 27 minutes. It was the goal that lifted the weight of not having scored in his first five games from his shoulders…it also opened the Messi floodgates. Last week Messi told Argentine newspaper Olé he would like to stay at Barcelona for the rest of his career but that 'players don't always get what they want'. What sane of mind president would sanction his sale after his latest landmark performances? Barcelona forward Lionel Messi moved ahead of Raul in the Champions League all-time scorers list, he is now the sole record holder .

The 27-year-old is now Barcelona's all-time top scorer; the Spanish league's all-time top scorer; and the Champions League's all-time top scorer, too. And such is the 27-year-old's genius that he has broken each one of those records by scoring a hat-trick. He bagged a treble against Granada last season to become the club's all-time leading scorer; he got three against Sevilla at the weekend to top La Liga's all time list; and he surpassed Raul's record 72-goal haul with three more against the Cypriot champions. He moved past Real Madrid legend Raul when he diverted a Jordi Alba shot past APOEL keeper Urko Pardo. He doubled his tally in the second half converting an Alves pass and then made it 4-0 from Pedro's cross to put him on 74 goals in 91 games. The Messi-show began after Suarez broke down APOEL's well-marshalled defence. Their keeper Pardo had saved from Messi after just two minutes and when Alves blasted over the keeper's bar from distance on ten minutes it was a symptom of the visitors' growing frustration. Suarez spurned a glorious chance on 18 minutes when Messi wriggled down the right and crossed. But the former Liverpool striker had to get his shot away quickly in a packed area and it went tamely straight at Pardo. Messi then teed-up Alba with a perfectly lofted pass but the full-back sent his shot over from the edge of the six-yard box. Barcelona were enjoying over 70 per cent of possession but still could not find a way through.

Then finally the breakthrough came as Suarez turned away from his marker down the left-hand channel and finished into Pardo's far corner. The tension lifted, both for him and his team-mates. Messi turned in Alba's shot to make it 2-0 and then back-heeled to Suarez who went for power over precision and sent his shot wide. The Argentine then chased 30 yards back to win possession as Barcelona finished the half strongly. He was in the mood for more goals and duly delivered them after the break, first from Alves' pass and then after good work from Pedro. Messi also set up Suarez who missed the chance to double his tally and when with 20 minutes Rafinha was harshly sent off, Suarez was replaced by Sergi Busquets as Luis Enrique looked to compensate for going a man down. Messi completed his hat-trick and not even a Dani Alves booking – meaning he misses Barcelona's last group game at home to Paris Saint-Germain – could ruin the night. Guilherme was later sent off for APOEL as the home side failed to grab a consolation goal. Barça will miss their Brazilian full back in the last game that they have to win to qualify as group leaders. But, full of confidence after the final whistle, Suarez said: 'We know how strong Paris [Saint-Germain] are but we are at home so it is in our hands to win the game and top the group.'

"Chelsea are currently in cruise control, unbeaten in all competitions so far this season and are six points clear at the top of the Premier League. Jose Mourinho's side thrashed Schalke 5-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday evening, with a devastating performance which encapsulates everything great about the Blues so far this campaign. Mourinho was delighted with the sublime, one-touch football displayed at Schalke: 'In this moment, we are very confident. We go step by step with this mentality. The players are very serious. Everything they do with big focus and ambition, but at the same time with this component, which is quite something new in Chelsea football: this happiness, this flair, this beauty.' Here are the stats that make Chelsea so impressive so far this season... 30 - Goals so far in the Premier League (rank No 1) Thanks largely to summer signing Diego Costa, the Blues are not only winning the majority of their games in the Premier League this season, they are free scoring too at an average of 2.5 goals per game. Twelve of the Chelsea squad have shared the goals as Mourinho's side are attacking with ease. Summer signing Diego Costa has been in sublime form for Chelsea, with 11 goals in the Premier League . 78 - Pass completion percentage in the final third (rank No 1) With the flamboyant attacking prowess of the likes of Eden Hazard, Oscar and Cesc Fabregas, Chelsea are able to set up numerous chances in front of goal thanks to their accuracy in the final third of the pitch. No wonder Costa is banging in the goals. 83 - Tackles won percentage in the league (rank No 1) Chelsea are not just an attacking threat, Mourinho as ever has built his side on a solid foundation with outstanding work rate. As a result the Blues are brutal but effective in defence, winning a high percentage of their challenges to then immediately head back out on another attack. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has managed to produce a side with plenty of style and substance this season . 11 - Goals conceded in the league (rank No 2) With Chelsea dominating their matches, they've managed to keep goals conceded down on average to just under one a game, second to Southampton. Thibaut Courtois has excelled between the posts for Chelsea so far this season, keeping stalwart Petr Cech on the bench and rejuvenated captain John Terry is organising the almost watertight defence. 53 - Percentage of Premier League shots on target (rank No 1) Mourinho and his coaching staff have evidently got the squad working on their efficiency in front of goal as the Chelsea squad lead the way with every other shot hitting the target. 22 - Percentage of goals to shots in the league (rank No 1) Following on from their sharp shooting, Chelsea are reaping the rewards from their accuracy as they are top of the table for their goal conversion rate with a goal coming after every five shots on target. Costa, celebrating another goal against West Brom, is the Premier League's top scorer after 12 games . 11 - Top scorer in the Premier League (Diego Costa) Spain striker Diego Costa signed for £32million in the summer from Atletico Madrid and on current form appears to be fine business by Chelsea. In just 11 league appearances, the brutal forward has been in clinical form by scoring 11 times, which has made up for his lack of goals in the Champions League (0 so far). In all competitions last season, Hazard was top of the charts for the Blues last campaign with 17, and that could be quickly surpassed by Costa. 14 - Goals so far in Champions League group stages (rank No 2) Only Mourinho's former club Porto have scored more in the Champions League this season than Chelsea and like in domestic matters, the squad are sharing the duties. Eight players have found the back of the net for the Blues in the group stages so far, with an average of just under three goals a game in their five group matches as they have cruised to qualification into the last 16. Midfielder Cesc Fabregas (left) described Chelsea's performance as 'brilliant' after their win against Schalke . 4 - Fabregas assists so far in the tournament (rank No 1) Cesc Fabregas has thrived back in London, since joining Chelsea from Barcelona this summer. The Spaniard has provided four assists in the Champions League and a total of 13 across all competitions as he continues to orchestrate the Chelsea attacks. Hazard has three assists so far in the Champions League and was top for the Blues in all competitions with eight last campaign. So it appears Fabregas has been the signing Chelsea have craved, to piece together their wealth of attacking talent. Belgium international Thibaut Courtois has excelled in goal for Chelsea, displacing Petr Cech as number one . 3 - Goals conceded in the Champions League (rank No 3) Very much like their domestic form, Chelsea are making sure they keep their opponents quiet and prevent the goals conceded. Having just let in just two goals so far in their five fixtures, the Blues are building a solid platform to feel confident they can attack without any vulnerability if they lose possession. 0 - Red cards in Europe (rank No 1) Chelsea aren't the only side to manage no red cards in the group stages so far but it's worth pointing out their success in the Champions League so far has been dealt with composure and stability, which is a facet in their game Mourinho is keen to maintain when the pressure increases in the knockout stages. Didier Drogba posted a picture of Chelsea's players looking happy as they flew back from Germany . 106 - Total crosses in the Champions League (rank No 3) Mourinho's current side are playing with an incredible versatility and once aspect of their play is utilising the wide areas. Chelsea are firing in over 20 crosses a game to pepper the oppositions box, which inevitably has led to chances for their attack. 63 - Percentage of shots on target in the group stages (rank No 1) Again, Chelsea's shooting efficiency is shining through on the European stage as the west Londoners are making sure their numerous attacks aren't wasted by at least hitting the target more often than not. Chelsea's players celebrate another goal as they sealed progression to the last 16 of the Champions League . 58 - Captain leading the way . Chelsea club captain John Terry is known to the fans as 'captain, leader, legend'. Having scored in the Champions League again at Schalke, the former England captain has now accumulated 58 goals for Chelsea which is a staggering statistic for a centre back, who has represented his beloved club over 600 times.

"Formula One teams have bowed to public pressure, and sporting fairness, by agreeing to abandon double points for next year’s final race. The rule was one of the sport’s most derided ever initiatives when it was introduced for the 2014 season, which ended last Sunday with Lewis Hamilton beating Nico Rosberg fair and square. Had the awarding of double points in Abu Dhabi swayed the championship, it would have been one of the biggest travesties in any sport. Public scepticism would have blown up to global outrage. Lewis Hamilton gives double peace signs after securing F1 championship fair and sqaure in  Abu Dhabi . The teams assemble before the season-ending Abu Dhabi GP where double points could have swayed the title . As Hamilton said before the race: ‘It is a question of what is fair. To lose by double points would suck.’ The teams had long known this and on Wednesday the Strategy Group and the F1 Commission meeting in Geneva decided to ditch the gimmick for 2015. The change needs to be ratified by the FIA’s World Motor Sport Council, but there is almost no chance that they will go against the teams on such a clear-cut matter. The final approval should come in the WMSC meeting in Doha on December 3. The rule, which was only in place for one year, was a bastardised version of Bernie Ecclestone’s proposal that three races should carry double points. The teams did not like this suggestion and the fudge of final scoring at only the last race was introduced. Hamilton waves the Union Jack after his victory in Abu Dhabi put his second title triumph beyond doubt . Hamilton (left) had to finish at least second in Abu Dhabi to ensure Nico Rosberg (centre) didn't beat him . F1 chief executive Bernie Ecclestone (right) had suggested three races be worth double points . VIDEO Hamilton secures title in Abu Dhabi . Ecclestone said of his plan: ‘One race is stupid but imagine if it was the last three races. It means that somebody would have to have a 150-point advantage minimum to be sure they would win. The teams have not accepted it because they are bloody idiots.’ It is unlikely his three-race idea will be adopted, but that every race will count the same. Double scoring was introduced to keep the last race alive after four championships had all been won by Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull. Last year he scorched to the title and the season faded away. But that did not convince the public of the merits of double scoring. One fans’ survey said opposition to the rule ran at 96 per cent.","Strategy Group and the F1 Commission decided at meeting in Geneva to axe double points for the final race of the Formula One season .

"Lewis Hamilton’s world championship charge was boosted by the last-minute arrivals of his girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger, father Anthony and brother Nicolas in Abu Dhabi. Hamilton, who secured the title with yet another win, had appeared mysteriously downcast ahead of the season finale.

I will always for the race for the win. ‘We’ll play it by ear, but I am racing to win. I am going to do my best to get as far ahead as possible. I feel great.’ That he did in style, storming to victory at the season finale in Abu Dhabi to beat Nico Rosberg, who failed to finish in the points after suffering an engine problem, to this year’s crown.

"A teenager who microwaved a stray cat to death because he thought it was ‘talking to him’ was sentenced to 22 weeks in prison today. Jamie Blake, 19, cooked the young male black cat for three minutes in his bedsit while he was in a drug-induced psychosis. He claimed that he argued with the cat because it had told him that his mother's former partner, now dead, had been injecting her with heroin. Guilty: Jamie Blake was jailed after he killed a stray cat by putting it in a microwave for three minutes . After killing the cat, he later laughed and joked about its death with fellow residents at the John Room House sheltered housing unit where he lived in Thetford, Norfolk. Prosecutor Nikki Miller said: ‘While in the community . area, he made comments to several other residents. He laughed about the . fact that he had put the cat in the microwave for three minutes and . killed it. ‘After initial disbelief, other residents became convinced that this had taken place and reported him to staff. ‘The cat was later found discarded in a wheelie bin along with the defendant’s microwave.’ After killing the cat, Blake bragged to fellow residents at John Room House (pictured) about the animal's horrific ordeal . Staff at the unit viewed CCTV footage which showed . him picking the cat up by the scruff of its neck and taking it into his . room at 10.25pm on September 27. The . footage showed him later leaving his room with a carrier bag which . appeared to have the cat in it and then disposing of the microwave the . following day. Cat hair and other ‘matter associated’ with the cat was found in the microwave. A post mortem carried out by the Animal Health Trust near Newmarket confirmed that the cat had been microwaved to death. Blake had befriended the cat, which he nicknamed Buddy, by letting it into his room at night and feeding it cheese and tuna. He . admitted causing unnecessary suffering and was also banned from keeping . animals for life by magistrates in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Disposed of: CCTV footage at the house showed Blake disposing of the microwave oven and a carrier bag that appeared to have the dead animal in it (file photo) When Blake was arrested, he told . police that he was an animal lover and had liked the cat, but he . admitted microwaving it until it died after having an argument with it. Mrs Miller said: ‘He stated that the . cat had begun talking to him and had made comments about his mother’s . ex-partner who is now deceased had injected her with heroin.’ Blake told police: ‘I thought you little bastard, saying stuff like that about my mum.’ Sally Dale, defending, said Blake suffered from a personality disorder which was untreatable under the Mental Health Act. At the time of the offence, he was suffering from psychosis induced by drugs. She said: ‘It is fair to say that there have always been concerns about his mental health and problems associated with it. Jamie Blake was sentenced to 22 weeks in prison at the magistrates' court (pictured) in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk . ‘They are exasperated by drug use and in particular his more recent usage of crack cocaine.’ Miss . Dale said Blake had been seeking treatment for his drug use and . deep-rooted problems since being remanded in custody at an earlier . hearing. She added: ‘He is . very clear and motivated and doesn’t want to return to his use of crack . cocaine. It is also fair to say he has responded well to the structured . environment of a custodial sentence. ‘He is attending numeracy and literacy classes and is a model prisoner.’ Miss Dale said: ‘There is some sense coming through in what he said the cat was saying. ‘His . mother’s partner did die early this year. He was a drug addict and his . mother did have drug problems. I am aware that that the ex-partner was . responsible for getting the mother back into drugs when she was with . him.’ Presiding magistrate Susan Taylor said: ‘The offence is so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified. The aggravating factors are that death occurred. ‘We can only imagine the suffering that poor animal had to endure. In mitigation we understand you are of limited capacity, but the act was intentional. ‘You did brag about this offence to other people and there was evidence on CCTV.’","Jamie Blake, 19, microwaved the cat to death while high on drugs .

"Rickie Lambert deserves to keep his place for Liverpool's crunch Premier League clash against Stoke City on Saturday, according to Gary Neville. The former Southampton frontman has scored two goals in as many starts for the Reds and broke his champions League duck in Wednesday night's 2-2 draw against Ludogorets. Mario Balotelli has failed to find the net in the league since his switch to Anfield and missed the stalemate in Sofia due to a groin strain. Rickie Lambert rises highest to head Liverpool level against Bulgarian side Ludogorets . Lambert celebrates his first-ever Champions League on his first start in Europe . However,  Neville believes the Italian should be playing second fiddle to Lambert. 'He should be playing 100 per cent ahead of Balotelli,' he told Sky Sports. 'The Liverpool players will want Rickie Lambert. He's someone to play off and make movements. He deserves to keep his place. He brought people into play and showed a good touch.' Mario Balotelli has failed to find the net in the Premier League since his move to Merseyside . Gary Neville insists misfiring Balotelli should be behind Lambert in the Anfield pecking order . Lambert as netted twice in as many games for Liverpool after being promoted t the starting XI . Reds hero Jamie Carragher reckons the 32-year-old should have had more opportunities after being restricted to just two Premier League starts since his summer switch to Merseyside. 'He needs to be playing regularly,' said Carragher. 'Maybe not against the elite, but in your run-of-the-mill games he should have had more opportunities. He's a goalscorer and can hold the ball up.' Liverpool legend Graeme Souness echoed the thoughts of his fellow pundits and says Lambert could provide the answer to their goalscoring problems. 'He's a clever player and knows the position inside out,' said Souness. 'He's a throwback if you like, a traditional centre forward. He will take the centre half on and has an eye for goal.'

"Click HERE to read Matt Barlow's match report . Yaya Sanogo can finally change his Twitter handle. Before Wednesday night it was: @Yayasanogoal22 in homage to his Arsenal goal record. Credit to the young Frenchman for being able to laugh at his own expense. It took a while - 13 appearances in total - but he is finally off the mark for Arsenal. Arsene Wenger has shown huge faith in Sanogo when supporters - and even some of his team-mates - have doubted his ability. With that rod off his back, maybe he can establish himself fully at the Emirates Stadium. Yaya Sanogo scored his first goal for Arsenal during their 2-0 win against Borussia Dortmund . Sanogo mocked his poor goalscoring record on his own Twitter and Facebook social media accounts . Jack Wilshere's loss has forced Arsene Wenger into rethinking his January transfer strategy. The Arsenal manager is still prioritising the capture of at least two central defenders; a position the Gunners have been dreadfully short this season. But Wenger is also now looking to purchase a defensive central midfielder to replace Wilshere - who could be out for four months if he needs surgery on his injured left ankle. Bayer Leverkusen's Lars Bender remains Wenger's dream signing, but Sportsmail understands they are also showing an interest in Sevilla's Grzegorz Krychowiak, who could be cheaper option. Their defensive targets include Celtic's Virgil van Dijk, Manchester United's Chris Smalling and Ipswich left back Tyrone Mings. Arsene Wenger could sign a replacement for the injured Jack Wilshere during the January transfer market . Arsenal are interested in signing Manchester United defender Chris Smalling . Here's a little known fact: Borussia Dortmund defender Neven Subotic once had a 10 day trial with Crystal Palace in 2006. Iain Dowie was manager at the time of Subotic's stint at Selhurst Park. He arrived as a defensive midfielder, but his 6ft 3ins frame meant Palace viewed him as an imposing defender. Subotic, who spent part of his childhood in the USA, played for the Eagles' sister club Crystal Palace Baltimore. Palace wanted to sign the then 18-year-old, who held a US passport, but red-tape meant a deal wasn't possible after the club failed to secure him a work permit. Soon after Subotic signed for Mainz. Dortmund centre back Neven Subotic came close to joining Crystal Palace in 2006 . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain made his 100th appearance for Arsenal in Wednesday's Champions League encounter. Quite an achievement for a player still only 21-years-old. There was conjecture about just how much the England man would play this season during the summer months. He was touted as the fall-guy following Alexis Sanchez's arrival. But Chamberlain has already started 10 games for the Gunners this term. It'll be interesting to see where he fits in once Mesut Ozil is fit again, though.

"Men may rejoice at this season’s hottest footwear trend, but women are holding up their hands in despair. Over-the-knee boots have returned to the High Street after a stomping comeback on catwalks. Opinion is divided. Sexy or slutty? And can any woman over 40 carry them off? Four Mail writers put them to the test… . I look like I should be out fishing . Melissa Kite, 42 . Who’d have thought that a £60 pair of thigh-hugging suede boots from Next could be so hard to get on? That was my first challenge. The second was not collapsing with helpless laughter. The fact I’m wearing a mini-dress with no tights means the whole ensemble screams ‘schoolgirl in knee socks’. Not a look I’m particularly comfortable cultivating. Then there are the four-inch heels. Are these boots really made for walking? Melissa felt more like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman in her boots . They are also so tight around the ankle that I fear all circulation will be cut off, and my toes will have to be amputated. However, one has to suffer to be stylish, and I am dying to hear what my boyfriend Will makes of my outfit. Sadly, timing is everything and he enters the bedroom just as I’m struggling, red-faced and panting, to get the boots on. This kills the moment rather, but once I’ve paraded up and down a bit, he concedes they are ‘very nice’ . . . if I ‘plan to take up fly fishing’. ‘But don’t you think I look like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman?’ I wail. ‘More like Robin Williams in Mrs Doubtfire,’ is his response. But then Will is always like this when I try something new. I decide I may have more luck with my friend Stephen, a gay lawyer who I arrange to meet the next day. ‘Well, this is an occasion,’ he declares. ‘It’s not every day Melissa gets her legs out.’ We cross the King’s Road in Chelsea and there’s a police car stopped at the lights. I’m fairly convinced the handsome young officer at the wheel is eyeing me up. Then again, on the basis I haven’t quite mastered the art of walking in the boots, he may just be concerned that I’m drunk and about to stumble on his bonnet. On the whole, I’ve really enjoyed transforming my image. I’d have loved to try on the boots with jeans — but they were too tight to cram denim into. They add a definite sexy edge to most outfits, though, and make me feel feminine. I just have to learn how to walk in them. My daughter cringed, which made me love them more . Frances Hardy, 57 . My daughter cringed with embarrassment which only made me love them more . It took five minutes to zip myself into my pair of £250 Duo Dita suede boots which for someone who is always in a rush, I would find particularly frustrating. The left boot slumped and rumpled like Nora Batty’s stockings and I had to wrestle it up my leg in a pose not dissimilar to one I use at the gym for leg-stretching. Only now am I told these come made-to measure, meaning there are a number of different calf sizes available. I didn’t know boot shopping had got so high-tech! No wonder I got it wrong. Now that I’ve been fitted into my calf size they fit like a dream! Frances modelled her boots at home for a reaction from her partner Iain . The right one, miraculously, slid on like a glove. Have I got mismatched legs or were the boots odd sizes? In either event, I was pleasantly surprised. I teamed them with skinny jeans. I loved the soft grey suede and, gratifyingly, they seemed to lengthen my leg. Also, because they’re just over-the-knee as opposed to sky-thigh-high I didn’t look as if I was auditioning for principal boy at the village panto either. Feeling quite smug, I clip-clopped downstairs where Iain, my partner, was immersed in the sports pages. Habitually I don’t arrive in the kitchen at 8am on Saturday dressed as if for an outing to London Fashion Week. But this fact didn’t impinge on him. ‘Ahem,’ I prompted. Iain finally focused on the boots. ‘They’re quite a statement,’ he said cagily. ‘Yes, but in a good or bad way?’ I persisted. ‘Actually, they’re really quite nice,’ he added – this, I assure you, is high praise – before returning to his newspaper. I wore the boots out to Sunday lunch at a country pub – by then I’d become quite adept at putting them on – and I couldn’t help noticing I elicited a fair few glances. Whether approving or pitying, I couldn’t say. And you can hardly accost random strangers to ask. But Linda, 57, and Paul, 59, the friends we met for lunch, liked them. For some reason, Paul was overly preoccupied with how long they took to take off. Friends, of course, are usually kind. Family less so. My daughter Amy, 23, was forthright. ‘If you had model’s legs you’d get away with them,’ she said. ‘And you’d look better if they ended at the knee.’ I usually listen to Amy’s fashion advice. This time, however, I’m tempted – quite brazenly – to ignore it. I’m too old to dress like a glam-rocker . Kate Battersby, 50 . There may be some 50-year-old women who can totter about in snakeskin thigh boots with four-inch heels and feel coolly assured of their place at the cutting-edge of style. I’m not one of them. Maybe it was the reaction of the guy I’m dating that did it. Having been unabashedly thrilled at the prospect of seeing me in my £525 Russell & Bromley boots, his anticipation congealed into frank puzzlement. ‘I assume you’re about to audition for a tribute band to The Sweet?’ he queried. Kate's friend's daughter was not amused to see her wearing the same boots as Katie Price . Seventies glam-rock was not the effect I’d been aiming for. I was hoping more for the sexy transformation mastered by Anne Hathaway in The Devil Wears Prada, when she sashays around in Chanel thigh boots. Also, my legs — which usually I list among the least hated parts of my body — don’t look all that great. My thighs appear chunky, with saggy knee-blubber settling in folds around the top of the boots. Still, I’m sure I can rely on my friend Jane for encouragement. I stagger off to her house, attempting an air of sassy confidence and ignoring the stares of passers-by. Jane opens the door — and hoots with laughter. ‘Hooker boots!’ she cackles. ‘I never had you down as Eurotrash!’ I try another girlfriend, Catherine. She stares then giggles. ‘Dick Whittington in panto! Or one of those Errol Flynn films set in medieval times. Just slap your thigh!’ Her daughter Francesca, 21, appears. ‘I love them!’ she exclaims. At last! Acknowledgement of my rightful status as a fashion maven! But she isn’t finished. ‘Katie Price wore those boots the other day on This Morning, and she’s like 36 — waaay too old for them.’ Enough. I go home and roll on the floor for ten minutes, wrestling with my boots to get them off, while envisaging the headline: Fire Brigade Release Ludicrous Middle-Aged Woman Trapped In Thigh Boots. I feel like the fourth musketeer . Ruth Sunderland, 46 . Certain women well beyond 40 could carry thigh boots off with aplomb. Mary Portas, for example, or evergreen rock chick Chrissie Hynde. But I’m a much more conservative dresser, partly because as a financial writer, I work in a male-dominated environment — and I’ve realised it doesn’t take much to set some men off on a train of thought that is, er, rather unbusinesslike. However, I needn’t have worried — my £149 boots from Dune are more pantomime than provocative. ‘Hurr, hurr, where’s Athos and Porthos?’ quips my husband Michael. He’s right — the problem with these boots isn’t that they are too tarty, but too Three Musketeers. Another downside is that they draw attention to a slight hint of thunder-thigh, even though I’m only a size 10. Yet they are extremely comfortable, and the expensive-looking burgundy suede puts paid to any aura of dockside brothel. The real test is whether they’ll pass muster with my 70-something mother — the world’s most merciless mutton-detector. Surprisingly, she declares: ‘Lovely autumn colour. Very stylish.’ I’ve come to realise that not all thigh boots are created equal. There are the Pretty Woman ones and the Real Woman ones. My pair might not induce Richard Gere to rescue me but they are surprisingly chic — and they don’t half keep your legs warm.","Over-the-knee boots have returned to the High Street .

"Jose Mourinho turned his mind games firmly on Steven Gerrard on Friday as the Chelsea manager prepared to renew hostilities with Liverpool. Mourinho advised Brendan Rodgers and his team against focusing on their calamitous end to last season — but not before reminding Gerrard of the enormity of his slip. ‘It gave the title to Man City, simple as that,’ said Mourinho. ‘Liverpool, with a point in that match, would have been champions. Without it, they lost the title. It meant nothing to us. After our defeat against Sunderland, that match meant professional pride. We were not in the race.’ VIDEOS Scroll down to watch .

The former Real Madrid manager oversees the session on Friday as he makes final preparations . Goalkeeper Courtois and the rest of the squad stretch during Chelsea training on Friday . Gerrard gifted Demba Ba the goal which shattered his best and, perhaps, final chance of winning the title. It was a seismic moment in Barclays Premier League history and in the football life of the Liverpool captain. Having beaten Manchester City a fortnight earlier, the Merseysiders were in control of their destiny. After losing to Chelsea, they surrendered a three-goal lead in a draw at Crystal Palace in the penultimate game of their campaign and finished two points behind City. ‘They don’t want to think about last season for the bad memories,’ said Mourinho. ‘I’d go back and think about the good memories, the fantastic matches they had, the victories and all the good things.’ Chelsea drew inspiration, seven months ago, from the coronation atmosphere they detected upon arrival in Liverpool. Mourinho was already fuming because his efforts to move the game from Sunday to Saturday to aid preparations for Chelsea’s Champions League semi-final had been ignored. He said last month that he felt his team had been cast as ‘clowns in the circus’ and delighted in plotting victory while resting many first-teamers for the tie against Atletico Madrid. The Liverpool skipper's slip played part in Chelsea's 2-0 win at Anfield in April . Jose Mourinho spoke of Steven Gerrard's slip for Liverpool against Chelsea last season . ‘We did not participate in the situation some people wanted us to participate in,’ said Mourinho. ‘Liverpool tried to win the game. Obviously, feeling that Chelsea were in a weakened situation, they had everything in their hands.’ Rodgers criticised Mourinho’s defensive tactics and Luis Suarez claimed in his book this week that one Chelsea player admitted he was ashamed to be time-wasting but had no choice. Mourinho reacted with scorn on Friday. ‘Another book,’ he said, adding that he might publish a picture book of memories but ‘not a book to tell s*** and criticise people who belong to my career’. The game relit a fierce rivalry which began a decade before when Mourinho and Rafa Benitez were in charge and it will fuel the passion inside Anfield at lunchtime on Saturday. ‘It’s a fantastic atmosphere and I enjoy playing there,’ said Mourinho. ‘But, I have to say, some people feel the atmosphere in a negative way. That’s not my case. Liverpool were top of the Premier League before the 2-0 defeat against Mourinho's Chelsea . ‘I don’t play and I don’t think it affects my players’ performances, but in the past we have examples of it affecting performances: goals that are not goals, penalties given that are not penalties.’ Anthony Taylor is the referee on Saturday.. Rodgers prepared to face the Premier League leaders by resting many first-team regulars, including Gerrard, against Real Madrid on Tuesday. Liverpool have stumbled this season and Chelsea are stronger, unbeaten in 17 games in all competitions and with Diego Costa fit to start. Costa has been left out of the Spain squad to concentrate on his fitness and will be given a few days’ rest after Saturday’s game, before returning to treatment on nagging hamstring and pelvic problems. ‘Liverpool know if they lose they are 15 points behind,’ said Mourinho. ‘If they are 15 points behind in November it’s not over, but it’s difficult. If they win, nine points behind is different to 15. It’s a very good motivation for them.’ Gerrard admitted in the summer that the impact of losing the title had led to the worst three months of his professional life but he has moved on and Rodgers says lesser characters would have been broken by what happened when he slipped over. Mourinho celebrates Chelsea's second goal of the game against Liverpool last season . Chelsea remain unbeaten so far this season and sit top of the Premier League . ‘Steven has the inner strength that the very, very best players have,’ said Rodgers. ‘You have to have that to perform at the level he has for 15 years at one of the top clubs where the scrutiny is on you week in, week out. ‘He has performed at a level that gets him over disappointments, that allows him to keep going and it is his character that defines him above even his talent. ‘He has been remarkable for this club throughout his career and will continue to be. I think it probably would have (broken weaker characters). ‘Steven is a big character and I know from seeing him work every day that he’s got over it. It’s something you might think a bit more about when you finish or retire but he and I haven’t had time to dwell on what happened.’ It has been said this week that Liverpool are still feeling the repercussions of losing to Chelsea but Rodgers doesn’t believe that. What’s more, he doesn’t even feel that 2-0 defeat was the defining game of the run-in. The most disappointing experience, he says, was drawing at Crystal Palace. ‘It halted us, absolutely,’ said Rodgers.","Steven Gerrard's slip handed Chelsea opener against Liverpool last season .

"Wales have complained to the BBC about Sonja McLaughlan’s questioning of coach Warren Gatland at Saturday’s 34-16 defeat by New Zealand. Gatland was unhappy with questions asked by McLaughlan before and after the match at the Millennium Stadium. She asked if he felt under pressure after 22 straight defeats by the southern hemisphere nations. Gatland was clearly irked and brushed past the cameras after saying: ‘And you are putting me under pressure as well, thanks.’ Wales rugby coach Warren Gatland was unhappy with BBC journalist Sonja McLaughlan's questioning . McLaughlan said it was her job to ask Gatland questions after Wales' defeat against New Zealand . The WRU raised concerns with their broadcast partner because they felt the questioning was at odds with a positive interview with man-of-the-match Jamie Roberts. On Monday McLaughlan, who has worked for the BBC since 1998, tweeted: ‘It is my job to ask questions and I will not be deterred from doing it.’ There was more tension at the Wales press conference at their training camp in the Vale of Glamorgan on Tuesday. McLaughlan’s question was followed up during an interview with defence coach Shaun Edwards who, despite reacting angrily, refused to dodge the issue and responded by referring to Gatland’s impressive record in the Six Nations. McLaughlan took to Twitter to reveal she was shocked by the reaction of her questions to Gatland . Wales crashed to a 34-16 defeat against New Zealand at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday . Despite Gatland’s poor record against southern hemisphere teams he is understood to have the full support of the WRFU and is contracted until 2019. But the decision to raise concerns with the BBC has been criticised on social media, while Edwards’ style of ‘fronting up’ has been applauded.","Warren Gatland was not happy with Sonja McLaughlan's questioning .

"Using a mobile phone does not increase the risk of brain cancer, claim scientists. Research into cancer rates of one of the largest groups of mobile phone users ever studied found no difference compared with people who did not use them. It is the second major study this year to rule out any change in rates of the disease - despite more than 70 million mobile phones being used in the UK. Researchers led by the Institute of Cancer Epidemiology in Copenhagen found cancer rates in the central nervous system were almost the same in both long-term mobile phone users and non-users . The latest Danish study investigated data on more than 358,000 mobile users over 18 years, thought to be the longest follow-up so far. But campaigners insisted the research was 'seriously flawed' and would falsely reassure mobile phone users. Researchers led by the Institute of Cancer Epidemiology in Copenhagen found cancer rates in the central nervous system were almost the same in both long-term mobile phone users and non-users. They studied the whole Danish population aged over 30 and born in Denmark after 1925 by gathering information on subscribers to mobile phones from the Danish phone network operators and from the Danish Cancer Register. They analysed data of 10,729 central nervous system tumours between 1990 and 2007, says a report in bmj.com (the online site of the British Medical Journal). When the figures were restricted to people with the longest use of mobile phones – 13 years or more – the cancer rates were almost the same as that among non-subscribers. There have been fears that cancer could be triggered by the brain's exposure to electromagnetic radiation emitted from mobile handsets held to the ear . The researchers said they observed no . overall increased risk for tumours of the central nervous system or for . all cancers combined in mobile phone users. There have been fears that cancer could be triggered by the brain's exposure to electromagnetic radiation emitted from mobile handsets held to the ear. But the researchers said they observed no overall increased risk for tumours of the central nervous system or for all cancers combined in mobile phone users. The authors said: 'The extended follow-up allowed us to investigate effects in people who had used mobile phones for 10 years or more, and this long-term use was not associated with higher risks of cancer. 'However, as a small to moderate increase in risk for subgroups of heavy users or after even longer induction periods than 10-15 years cannot be ruled out, further studies with large study populations, where the potential for misclassification of exposure and selection bias is minimised, are warranted.' Mobile phone mast: Researchers said they observed no overall increased risk for tumours of the central nervous system or for all cancers combined in mobile phone users . Professor Malcolm Sperrin, Director of Medical Physics at Royal Berkshire Hospital, and Fellow of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine, said: 'This study is very large in terms of the number of people involved, is large in terms of the number of usage of the phones and also has a random nature being based on the purchase of a telephone contract rather than being a sub-group. 'The findings clearly reveal that there is no additional overall risk of developing a cancer in the brain although there does seem to be some minor, and not statistically significant, variations in the type of cancer. 'This paper supports most other reports which do not find any detrimental effects of phone use under normal exposures.' Earlier this year Manchester University researchers found no statistically significant change in rates of newly diagnosed brain cancers in England between 1998 and 2007, saying it was unlikely 'we are on the forefront of a brain cancer epidemic'. But other scientists disagree, saying the Danish study excluded business users and included as non-users people who began using mobiles later on. Denis Henshaw, Emeritus Professor of Human Radiation Effects, Bristol University said the study was 'worthless', and the researchers themselves admitted non-users may have been misclassified which would bias the findings. He said: 'This seriously flawed study misleads the public and decision makers about the safety of mobile phone use.' Vicky Fobel, director of MobileWise, a charity advising on mobile phone and health, said: 'All this shows that this study and the press release promoting its findings are misleading the public by implying that phone users have the all clear. 'The study only looked at short-term use of mobile phones and by mis-analysing the data has massively underestimated the risks. All the other studies that have looked at the long-term risks have found a link between phone use and brain tumours. 'This study gives false reassurance and distracts us from the important job of helping the public, especially children, to cut the risk from mobiles.'","More than 70million mobile phones used in UK .

"Liverpool's Champions League hopes remain alive but a late Ludogorets equaliser saw them leave Bulgaria disappointed. They did, however, show resilience to recover from goalkeeper Simon Mignolet's third-minute blunder as Rickie Lambert scored his second in as many games before Jordan Henderson scored the vital second just before half-time, only for Georgi Terziev to nick an equaliser to secure a 2-2 draw at the death.

"Depending where you look, Manchester City are anywhere from second to fourth in Champions League Group E following Sergio Aguero’s last-gasp winning goal against Bayern Munich. Level on five points with Roma and CSKA Moscow – with Bayern sailing clear as group winners – City’s unusual path in this season’s competition has caused a few sore heads when it comes to working out exactly where they currently stand in the table. Ultimately UEFA rules will dictate whether the English champions progress or not but as it stands there seems no universal understanding of their position. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manuel Pellegrini: We have to do our duty and try to beat Roma . (Top) A national newspaper had Manchester City in second place in the table thanks to their goal difference. (Middle) UEFA, European football's governing body, use alphabetical order to put City in third on their website. (Bottom) The true reflection of the group after five games has City fourth, behind Roma and CSKA Moscow . European football’s governing body have City in third on their website – but this appears to contradict their own rules. Point 7.06 in the latest Champions League regulations dictates a number of principles in descending order of importance for splitting two or more teams who finish level on points. The primary method is to use results drawn from only those teams who are tied. So, in this case, Bayern's results should be eliminated from the calculations. Sergio Aguero celebrates the goal which completed his hat-trick against Bayern Munich on Tuesday . Aguero's goals helped Manchester City beat the German giants after a dramatic finish at the Etihad Stadium . That leaves Roma and CSKA (yet to play their final game against the German champions) on five points, but City effectively on two points – after draws at home to Roma and in Moscow, and with their final game in Italy to come and rendered a must-win. The second determining factor goes on goal difference, which is needed to separate Roma from CSKA. Given Rthe Serie A side lost 7-1 at home to Bayern, it is fairly easy to see how discarding those results against Pep Guardiola’s men will benefit them. Doing so leaves the Italians with a goal difference of four, and the Russians on minus three. So taking all that into account, as it stands, the group should read Roma second, CSKA third and City fourth. That is the consensus among English media now. Bayern reflect on defeat at City - but Manuel Neuer and Co are already safely into the knockout stages . Roma and CSKA Moscow battled out a 1-1 draw on Tuesday and are currently above City in the table . City must beat Francesco Totti's (centre) Roma in their final group game to stand a chance of progress . So why do UEFA have it Roma second, City third and CSKA fourth? The answer: alphabetical order. UEFA only implement their rules once all matches have been played and all head-to-head records can be worked out. Still not make sense? Well, UEFA have the teams listed as AS Roma, Manchester City, and PFC CSKA Moskva. The PFC is used to differentiate from CSKA’s other sporting teams (ice hockey, volleyball, basketball etc). So there we have it. Enough information to make Manuel Pellegrini’s brain melt. To avoid any embarrassing miscalculations like at Bayern last year, he should just send out his team to win in the Stadio Olimpico. WHAT WE KNOW... WHERE IT GETS TRICKY... P.S. There is not a universal system adopted for splitting teams who finish level on points in domestic leagues. It ranges across the globe. In England - as Manchester City well know - goal difference is the deciding factor. They became the first team to win the Premier League via that method in 2012 when Aguero (him again) struck in the last minute to beat QPR. City had the exact same record as rivals United but a superior goal difference. Aguero celebrates arguably the most famous goal in Premier League history, which won the title in 2012 . Liverpool’s collapse from three up at Crystal Palace last year can well be attributed to their frantic pursuit of goals to close the gap on City, who once again had a better record in that respect. The Bundesliga uses the same method. In Spain, head to head is used instead. When the three big teams were all close in the table last season it was Atletico Madrid who breathed easier than Real or Barcelona, given their advantageous record. As it happened they won La Liga by three points in any case. Serie A uses head to head also. The French use goal difference, then goals scored, but if teams are still inseparable a play-off decider is staged to determine the champions. Click to Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas has set the record straight with Spain team-mate Sergio Ramos, who questioned his commitment to the national team. Fabregas and club team-mate Diego Costa missed Spain's last two encounters - a 3-0 triumph over Belarus in a Euro 2016 qualifier and a 1-0 defeat by Germany in a friendly - earlier this month with injuries. Real Madrid defender Ramos questioned the absence of the two Chelsea players, who had played for 90 minutes in the 2-1 Premier League win at Liverpool just days prior to joining Spain's training camp. Cesc Fabregas (left), in action against Schalke on Tuesday, has been brilliant for Chelsea this season . Fabregas played against West Brom at the weekend after missing two Spain games in the international break . Real Madrid and Spain defender Ramos (left) criticised the commitment of players missing internationals . 'Yes I felt like he was alluding to me,' Fabregas told Spanish radio station Cadena Cope. 'I hate that someone doubts my commitment. 'I have played many games (for Spain) and have joined the national team many times without playing. I've played a total of 94 games for Spain, I've been going for nine years, always. And with a big smile. 'I already told Sergio what I thought about it (his comments). Ramos, in action for Spain against Germany, had a dig at Chelsea pair Diego Costa and Fabregas . 'I told him that we played together since the Under 21s and there was no need for him to send messages through the press. 'I said to him that he could call me up and tell it to my face. Everything is clear now and that's what we had to do, to speak. We spoke on the phone and everything is fine.' The 27-year-old insists it was crucial for him to remain in London during the international break in order to recover from a hamstring problem. 'I had a tendinitis in my left leg and had I played, I could have suffered the same situation as (Luka) Modric,' Fabregas said. Fabregas says he has cleared the air with Ramos after the pair had a conversation on the phone . Real Madrid's Croatian midfielder Modric aggravated a thigh injury in a 1-1 draw against Italy and will be sidelined for three months. 'I told the (Spain) coach (Vicente del Bosque) and everything was fine,' Fabregas said. 'He had the same thing when he was a player.' Despite his recurring hamstring problems, Fabregas has enjoyed a superb start to life at Chelsea since moving to the London outfit this summer after three seasons at Barcelona. Fabregas has scored one goal and set up 10 more in 12 Premier League appearances so far to help Jose Mourinho's side lead the Premier League. 'I am playing football with him (Mourinho) where I feel really good, in the position I like to play in,' he said. 'I feel free. 'Perhaps I'm playing the best football of my career.

Yet as Georgi Terziev rose to head in an 88th-minute equaliser, a little bit of the hoped-for Red revival died. They couldn’t hold the lead. Again. They couldn’t get it over the line. Again. Forget the permutations, the blow was psychological. If Liverpool take the lead at Anfield in their final group game next month, there will be no great confidence that it will be maintained.

Not one of the storied European names. Not Real Madrid; not even Liverpool. But the elite have been travelling to tricky corners of Europe like this for decades and occasionally coming unstuck. The Soviet era national stadium. The iconic oblong floodlights. Bitter cold and a horrible pitch. A classic eastern location. We used to watch grainy footage of Liverpool in action on nights like this in the days when the competition was called the European Cup. They were never easy games. And neither was this. Liverpool had held their lead for close to an hour when the mounting Ludogorets pressure told. It was a corner, one of a number late on. This one found Terziev, a Bulgarian international who once had an unsuccessful trial with Newcastle United, powering his header past Simon Mignolet. At that point the hope that this would be a watershed night evaporated. Far from building confidence, it became further evidence of Liverpool’s frailty. Mark Lawrenson got sent off here, at the Vasili Levski Stadium, in what might be termed the good old days. Now he watched from the press box, quietly anxious about the way Liverpool were being pressed back deeper by Ludogorets’ ambition. What Liverpool would give for a defender of his composure on nights like this. For a goalkeeper like Ray Clemence or even Bruce Grobbelaar, too. From the third minute, when they fell behind, to the very end as Ludogorets pressed and pressed, Liverpool were nervy at the back. They rode their luck a little, too. It may have been a penalty when Glen Johnson fouled Mihail Alexandrov in the second half, but referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz of Spain gave it outside the box. Sadly, Mignolet, whose penalty save against Stoke City was a catalyst for the run that took Liverpool to within touching distance of the title last season, is no longer part of the solution, but a large slice of the problem. He was at fault for the first goal here, even if it was Kolo Toure’s initial mistake that put Liverpool on the back foot. Henderson roars with joy as he celebrates his goal with captain Steven Gerrard . Henderson taps the ball past Ludogorets goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov to put Liverpool in front . Lambert reacts after missing a chance to score past Ludogorets' goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov . Toure cleared the ball straight to Marcelinho — one of five Brazilians in the Ludogorets squad — and he struck a low shot from just outside the area. It was powerful but straight and should have presented little problem for a top-class goalkeeper. Mignolet’s attempt to gather it into his body was pitiful. The ball rebounded off his chest and striker Dani Abalo, late of Celta Vigo in Spain, was first to react, prodding it into the net from close range. It was not the only time Mignolet’s handling caused concern. Every shot he faced he reacted to as if it had exploded out of a jack-in-the-box directly in front of him. The pitch was partly to blame for that, calling into question Liverpool’s decision to train at Melwood rather than out here. No goalkeeper will ever get used to an inconsistent bounce like this, but Mignolet might not have looked so startled each time it happened. These were not the only nasty instances. Mignolet completely missed a cross into his box in the first half — and thankfully so did everybody else — while Toure almost put a low ball from Alexandrov into his own net.

Liverpool can only advance to the round of 16 if they beat Basle at Anfield on the final matchday. Remaining games: December 9 - Liverpool vs Basle, Real Madrid vs Ludogorets. In the 33rd minute, a shot from 30 yards by Fabio Espinho pitched in a rough patch and almost biffed Mignolet on the nose as he sought to collect it. By then, Liverpool were wobbling. This being a charmed week for English clubs in Europe, however, eight minutes before half-time, Brendan Rodgers’ team were ahead. Ludogorets had probably edged the action, but like Manchester City against Bayern Munich, fortune favoured the English and Ludogorets let them back into the game with two errors: the second a lapse, but the first a real horror show. Jordan Henderson played a long, rather aimless, ball into the box, but it seemed to catch goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov and defender Cosmin Moti in two minds — and neither of them were worthy of an application to MENSA.

Raheem Sterling (left) goes on the attack for Liverpool but is tracked by Romanian defender Cosmin Moti . Moti dawdled, Stoyanov froze and Rickie Lambert popped in between them and sent a header on a gentle trajectory into the far corner. It was the sort of goal that had the whole stadium looking to the linesman, expecting to see the flag that had signalled for play to stop. There was none. Ludogorets were truly that dozy: and five minutes after going behind, Liverpool were level again. They created little after that, though, and a shot from Raheem Sterling that rose high over the bar seemed to sum up the difference in form from last season. Yet with 37 minutes gone, Liverpool got the goal that should have changed the dynamic of their campaign. It came around the time that, over in Basle, Cristiano Ronaldo was giving Real Madrid the lead to greatly improve Liverpool’s chances of progress — and while Henderson could not have known the news, he responded to Sterling’s cross with an urgency that implied he did.

Henderson has never scored for England and one might ask why, considering the Lampardesque energy he displayed to arrive at the far post here, timing his run perfectly and finishing from a tight angle to give Liverpool a gasp of breathing space. The marking could have been tighter, but that was true at either end. For Liverpool, however, the defensive problem is growing.

"After such success in the holding role last season, Steven Gerrard was moved to the top of the midfield diamond. He is a superb player but he could not get into the game. It is a position that requires constant thrust and bursts of pace but Gerrard is 34 years old now, so that is not his strength. I can see him playing at the highest level for a couple more years in a deep role but not there. But Brendan Rodgers obviously felt he needed his best player in a more advanced position. Steven Gerrard has plenty left in him for Liverpool, but not in that attacking midfield position . Gerrard is better suited in a deep role in the midfield for Liverpool; bursting through isn't his strength . Liverpool were relying on Jordan Henderson to break from deep and get beyond Rickie Lambert and Gerrard, as he did for his goal. Simon Mignolet was at fault for the goal that saw the Bulgarian hosts take the lead on Wednesday night . Messy Mignolet must be better prepared . People were quick to defend Simon Mignolet for the opening goal, saying the ball bounced awkwardly in front of him, but he was at fault. Keepers warm up for such a long time these days so there must be something wrong with his preparation. It shouldn’t have been a surprise to him that the surface was uneven. He will know it was an awful mistake. He seems to have a big problem with long-range efforts - with another one hitting him in the face. Mignolet is having a tough time and he needs to do better. ...................................................................... Did Rodgers drop Dejan Lovren or others or were they just rested? We will find out on Saturday against Stoke. Rodgers has struggled with managing his squad now Liverpool have games every few days. Is this another attempt to do that or is he is just fed up with too many poor performances? ..................................................................... Raheem Sterling is Liverpool’s brightestshining light. There are not many young English players who can cross with both feet. He drifts past people effortlessly.

"Lewis Hamilton admitted his relationship with Nico Rosberg reached ‘crisis point’ this year as the Mercedes team-mates battled for the Formula One world championship. Hamilton triumphed at the season-ending race in Abu Dhabi on Sunday after he won in the desert and Rosberg, struck down by gremlins in his Mercedes, failed to finish in the points. Hamilton and Rosberg’s friendship, established when they battled it out on the European karting scene in their teens, was pushed to the limit this season as they fought for the biggest prize in motor racing.

Asked whether their relationship reached crisis point, Hamilton, who touched down in London on Monday evening, said: ‘It did. It did. It was very tough. ‘We have known each other since we were 13 so we have that history coming into this season. It has been the most intense battle I've ever had.’ Hamilton and Rosberg endured a very public falling-out in Monaco after the Briton accused his team-mate of deliberately running off the circuit to scupper his qualifying lap.

He touched down with Nicole Scherzinger, who had flown to Abu Dhabi to watch her man on Sunday . Rosberg started from pole and won the race. Hamilton tellingly said afterwards: ‘We are colleagues, not friends’. The pair then collided at the Belgian Grand Prix in August with Hamilton suffering a puncture and failing to finish as Rosberg came home in second. ‘There is a lot of stuff that goes on, the psychological warfare throughout the year, and obviously Spa was very, very hard to take, when he got 18 points and I did not finish,’ said Hamilton.

"Brendan Rodgers did his best to remain cool on a stressful night, showing little emotion when Ludogorets went in front and just holding an arm aloft when Liverpool equalised through Rickie Lambert. His mask slipped, though, when Georgi Terziev scored late on make it 2-2 and he was captured on TV saying, ‘Oh ******* hell.’ Brendan Rodgers maintained an air of cool during Liverpool's turbulent clash with Ludogorets . But the Liverpool boss couldn't keep his emotions under wraps as it see-sawed to a 2-2 finish . Liverpool not alone in Sofia . This may have been a ‘home’ game for Ludogorets but they did not enjoy unanimous backing in the Vasil Levski Stadium. The match was played in Sofia, 200 miles from Ludogorets’ home stadium in Razgrad, and a number of locals came to add their support to the visitors. As one banner read: ‘We are Liverpool - Bulgaria.

Kolo celebrates a near miss . Kolo Toure could never be accused of hiding his emotions, often looking distraught after calamitous mistakes.

"Jonny Evans says Louis van Gaal's training methods are not to blame for Manchester United's painfully long injury-list. The defender made his comeback on Tuesday as he started for the reserves in their 5-0 win against Blackburn after two months on the sidelines with an ankle injury .

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: Selections dictated by huge injury list . Jonny Evans believes Louis van Gaal is not to blame for Manchester United's long injury list . 'Players don't get injured on purpose,' he told MUTV.

'There were a couple of other injuries - Phil Jones has got one [shin splints] that came out of the blue. We don't want any more injuries but what can we do about it? 'They're freak injuries and it's difficult from that point of view. It'd be nice to get settled in the team - everyone in the squad wants to get settled in their position as well.'

"A three-month-old baby boy is recovering in hospital after allegedly spontaneously catching fire - for the fourth time. Rahul, was admitted for treatment of ten degree burns at an intensive care unit in Chennai, India last week, and doctors at the hospital say he suffers from 'spontaneous human combustion'. Medical staff alleges that - for the fourth time in his short life - Rahul has burst into flames with no external source of ignition. Scroll down for video . Rare case: Rahul, three months, is receiving treatment for his burns at a hospital in Chennai, India, after allegedly self-combusting . According to doctors Rahul may have caught fire due to the excretion of gases through his skin, which has led to him suffering burns on his chest and head. ‘The baby is stable and treatment is on for burn injuries and scars. Life-saving support systems are there for Rahul in the intensive care unit,’ said R. Narayana Babu, head of paediatrics at the hospital. To watch the report in full click here . He told IBN Live that the baby will be under observation and may be discharged after two weeks depending on his condition. Rahul, from Villupuram, an area 100miles from Chennai, suffered the first incident when he was just nine days old. Fire boy: Rahul is being examined by a doctor with his mother by his side, who claims this is the fourth time her son has burst into flames . ‘People thought I set him on fire deliberately,’ his mother, Rajeswari told IBN Live. According to the parents, their community ostracized them, and . Rahul’s father, a farm worker, says they have lost everything as a . result of his son's condition. Spontaneous human combustion (SHC) has been implied as a cause of death in a number of documented cases where burned corpses have been found without an apparent external source of ignition. An estimated 200 cases have been found throughout history and victims are often elderly, sick, or under the influence of alcohol, which woudl explain why they have not been able to escape the flames. Puzzled scientists have come up with the ‘wick theory’ to explain such events. The theory is that the human body can become an ‘inside out’ candle . The person’s clothes are the wick, while their body fat is the wax or flammable substance,  that keeps the blaze going. Limbs may be left intact because of the temperature gradient, with the bottom half of the body being cooler than the top. Some have postulated that static electricity could cause the needed spark. Rajeswari alleges . that Rahul has suffered four episodes of  spontaneous fire and suffered . burn injuries, the last incident taking place last month. However, . doctors at Kilpauk Medical College Hospital in Chennai treating Rahul . say they only have the mother's version of events to go on as the baby . boy does not have any medical records. 'The baby has to be carefully observed. We . have to investigate whether the ailment is genetic,' Prof. R. Jayachandran of the department of pediatrics at Kilpauk Medical College Hospital said. 'We will carry out . tests to find out the kind of gases generated by the baby’.' Not all believe the mother's story of self-combustion. 'Spontaneous Human Combustion-syndrome is a hoax theory,' the hospital's burns specialist Dr J Jagan Mohan told The Times of India. 'A baby catching fire spontaneously is not possible. 'Alcoholics have a very small percentage of alcohol secreted in their sweat but even that wouldn't generate a fire.' Until a proper diagnosis is made, Rahul is given treatment that is only symptomatic, with the administration of antibiotics.","Three-month-old admitted to Indian hospital with ten degree burns .

"Two movie-goers had to be treated by paramedics after they experienced adverse and shocking reactions to graphic scenes in a new horror film at the world-renowned Sundance Film Festival.

While he was being treated, his girlfriend also ran into the lobby and began to vomit. The night before, another woman reportedly left in tears because she could not stand the suspense. Terror: The new horror film V/H/S was too much for one viewer who ran from the cinema and passed out . Co-writer Simon Barrett admits that 'while very funny in parts, the film is also quite intense and gory' The lurid accounts of movie-goers passing out will no doubt lead some to suspect that this may have been an attempt to court publicity - but the film's production team insist what happened was real. Producer Roxanne Benjamin, posting on . Twitter as the drama unfolded at the film festival in Park City, Utah, . said they were forced to call ambulances and insisted it was a 'scary' experience. 'It was scary and not fun, and . everyone is grateful the guy and his girlfriend are OK,’ she wrote. ‘And . they wanted to go back in the theatre!

Mr Barrett said that the segment, . 'while very funny in parts, is also quite intense and gory,' and noted . that the film's handheld camera style and other factors 'can probably be . a bit difficult to take'. The Blair Witch Project by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez became a landmark film in horror movie history when it was released in 1999 to huge critical acclaim. Audiences were left stunned by the realistic nature of the film, which left more to the imagination than most of its predecessors. It meant that less details provided more scares for viewers. The 2007 release Paranormal Activity, directed by Oren Peli, featured a couple disturbed by a demon at night in their home, and it was acclaimed for its slow build up and horrifying ending. It became the most profitable independent picture in cinema history thanks to a miniscule $15,000 budget and shocked audiences with its simple filmography rather than Hollywood special effects. The Exorcist, a 1973 film directed by William Friedkin that still gets viewers running for the hills when they watch it over and over again, featured a child becoming possessed by a mysterious entity. The movie was praised by horror fans for feeling claustrophobic and Entertainment Weekly labelled it as a ‘viscerally harrowing movie’ that is ‘so disturbing it will mess you up for months’. And finally... The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 might not be one of the scariest films ever, but some movie-goers had seizures because of flashing lights in a controversial birth scene. The fantasy film contains a series of red and white flashing lights during the scene when Kristen Stewart's character Bella gives birth to a baby girl that is half-human and half-vampire.","Two movie-goers treated by paramedics after witnessing graphic scenes .

"Wanted: Police killed Donald Hux, the ex-husband of Sandy Carl Huckabee's wife Amy, in a shoot out Sunday night. He was the main suspect in the death of both Amy and her current husband Sandy . Police have killed the man who murdered the cousin of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, and the suspect shot ex-wife dead during the ensuing fire fight. The shootout occurred in the late hours of Sunday night, after they found Donald Hux, 36, following a frenzied manhunt.

Sam Burgess will make his grand entrance into a whole new ball-game on Friday night, having realised in recent weeks that he faces a monumental task in crossing the rugby divide. The 25-year-old Yorkshireman has come home from Australia as a feted, decorated league icon — World Player of the Year and a man whose c.v. now features comic-book heroism in a title-winning cause. But under the lights of The Rec, against Harlequins, he will be a union rookie leaping into the unknown. Since arriving in the West Country last month, Bath’s high-profile recruit has been recovering from facial surgery and undergoing a rapid induction into his new code. He has made sufficient progress to be considered for a debut off the bench, amid the maelstrom of an Aviva Premiership encounter. Sam Burgess is preparing to make his rugby union debut for Bath on Friday night . Burgess hasn't played a competitive match since the NRL grand final in October . After initial fitness work and weight training, several days in the ‘padded cell’ at Farleigh House gave Burgess an insight into such alien arts as ruck-clearing and ball-presentation. Then, as the intensity increased, he realised that although he was fit to play again, he could expect a tough education. ‘The only way to test it more now is to play,’ he said. ‘There’s a lot to take in, but the best way for me to learn is on the field, so I’ve been pushing to get back as quickly as possible. I’m nowhere near to fully understanding the game yet. I’m still a novice. I’m definitely not going to go out and break records, but hopefully I won’t look too out of place! ‘I’m not nervous, but I’m anxious to see how it goes. I’ve watched so much footage and I just want to have a crack at it.’ The 25-year-old suffered a fractured eye-socket and cheekbone in the NRL final .

Insight and fun from a unique sporting voice . There has been great intrigue about the positional deployment of Burgess, given England’s desire to unleash him in midfield. So far at Bath, he has been getting up to speed with the varied roles of centre and back-rower, though he will be a centre replacement tomorrow night. ‘I’m trying to cover all bases,’ he said. ‘I don’t know where I’m going to play. ‘In time, I will find a place which works best for the team. I might not be able to do what everyone thinks I can do. I might not get the best out of my game at 12; that might happen in a different position. In time, we’ll see.’ Given his profile and reputation, there is huge interest in how Burgess progresses in union, with the 2015 World Cup looming. The England coaches would like him on board and the fans might eagerly anticipate that scenario, but he faces an arduous transition. ‘When I first thought about coming to union, I thought about England and the World Cup,’ added Burgess — the ‘face’ of Canterbury’s new fashion range, which launches next year. ‘It was something I really wanted to aim for. But since I’ve got here it’s just been Bath, Bath, Bath, Bath, Bath. I’ve watched the autumn internationals and I’d love to be part of them but being here now, I know how hard it’s going to be to make the conversion. ‘I’ll give it my best shot, that’s all I can say. I would love to represent my country, I’ve wanted to do it since I was a kid and now I have changed careers, I’ve realised it is going to be a tough task. 'I’m not writing myself off, I’m just saying that I now understand how hard these guys work to be doing what they’re doing. I’ve got so much to learn. Whether I can do it fast enough, that’s the challenge. We’ll see what happens, but on Friday night, I definitely won’t be thinking about England.’ Burgess believes he must concentrate on playing union before thinking of an England call-up .

Bath's new signing poses with the club shirt and director of rugby, Mike Ford . - Born on December 14 1988 in West Yorkshire to a rugby league player father and a schoolteacher mother who also played league, Burgess and his brothers brothers George, Tom and Luke were destined to play rugby. - Attended Heckmondwike Grammer School, where he was given the nickname ‘moonhead’, and played junior rugby for Dewsbury Moor Amateur Rugby League Football Club. - Made his debut for Bradford Bulls at 17 in 2006, and was named Senior Academy Player of the Year that season. His reputation in Bradford’s second row grew and he was rewarded with a call-up to the Great Britain squad for a series of matches against New Zealand, during the first of which he scored a try. - Father and idol Mark — who played league at a semi-professional level with Nottingham City — died in 2007 after a short battle with motor neurone disease. Sam was his father’s primary carer during his illness, and would carry him up the 21 stairs in the family home to bed each night. - In 2009, was contacted by Hollywood star Russell Crowe regarding the brothers moving to Crowe’s South Sydney Rabbitohs side. Became the first quartet of brothers to play in the Australian top flight since 1910. Sam, in particular, soon endeared himself to the Rabbitohs faithful, and took on legendary status after he played almost the entire 2014 NRL Grand Final with a broken cheekbone. - Three of the brothers’ exploits for the Rabbitohs saw them named in the England squad for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, with eldest sibling Luke missing out. Sam finished the tournament with two tries as England were knocked out in the semi-final by New Zealand. - Despite Rabbitohs chief executive Shane Richardsson’s proclamation that Burgess was ‘the greatest forward ever to have played our game’, the 25-year-old was seduced by the opportunity to try his hand at Rugby Union and earn a call-up to Stuart Lancaster’s side.

Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti expects Basle to progress in the Champions League at Liverpool's expense - because they are a fitter side. The defending champions, who had already qualified for the last 16, earned a hard-fought 1-0 victory against Basle at St Jakob-Park on Wednesday to cement their place at the top of Group B on 15 points.

"Simon Mignolet's fumble allowed Ludogorets to open the scoring on Wednesday night, and adds to a catalogue of unsure performances from the Belgian between the sticks this season. Former Reds ‘keeper Bruce Grobbelaar has put the blame for Liverpool’s poor start to the season on Mignolet, who he says is 'worse than Dracula'. 'He doesn’t command his area,' Grobbelaar told BBC this week. 'I’ve likened Mignolet to worse than Dracula because at least Dracula comes out of his coffin now and then.' Here's what Sportsmail's Martin Keown and Jamie Carragher think about Mignolet's situation. Simon Mignolet (centre) struggles to get up after fumbling a shot from distance . Dani Abalo pounces on Mignolet's mistake to put Ludogorets 1-0 up after less than three minutes . Mignolet (centre) shows his frustration at his mistake by booting the ball away . Martin Keown . 'People were quick to defend Simon Mignolet for the opening goal, saying the ball bounced awkwardly in front of him, but he was at fault. 'Keepers warm up for such a long time these days so there must be something wrong with his preparation. 'It shouldn’t have been a surprise to him that the surface was uneven. He will know it was an awful mistake. 'He seems to have a big problem with long-range efforts - with another one hitting him in the face. Mignolet is having a tough time and he needs to do better.' Mignolet appears to shows his anger toward team-mate Kolo Toure, who looks equally frustrated . Mignolet had another night to forget in the Liverpool goal and his critics continue to mount up . Jamie Carragher . 'It's a major concern Liverpool just can't make a clean sheet now,' Carragher said, speaking on Sky Sports. 'It's another mistake for him and it's getting to the stage now... Lovren was taken out of the team tonight, he [Mignolet] probably needs the same at the moment. For his own good. 'The problem is, Brad Jones on the bench is not better than Mignolet, is that the answer? 'It's not just about a keeper, it's any player. Sometimes you think you'll play yourself out of the bad form, we've been there ourselves. 'Sometimes it is good to step back out of the limelight and let others have a go.' Jamie Carragher revealed his concern at Liverpool's inability to keep clean sheets this season . PS (Here's what Brendan Rodgers had to say) ‘Hopefully it is not an issue with his confidence,’ said Rodgers, after Mignolet's recent criticism. ‘ It was a disappointment for the team because we wanted a solid start and to go behind so early very frustrating. ‘The pitch was difficult for the outfield players and the goalkeepers; it was very bobbly, especially around the box. Thankfully it didn’t cost us overall and the players showed great character to come back.'

"Click here for the stats from the game with our brilliant Match Zone service . Seventy-three seconds was all it took Yaya Sanogo. Well, 18 months, 19 appearances and 73 seconds, but when his first Arsenal goal finally arrived, it was wonderfully timed. It was a strike to puncture the pressure and soothe the nerves. Sanogo was engulfed by supporters and team-mates, while Arsene Wenger punched the air. A striker who had forgotten the way to goal had found the net at a most crucial moment, before the result was put beyond doubt by Alexis Sanchez, a striker who seemingly cannot miss. Alexis Sanchez runs towards the Arsenal fans in celebration of his second-half strike against Borussia Dortmund . The Chile international now has 13 goals and three assists in his last 20 games for Arsene Wenger's side . Sanchez looks on as his curled strike puts Arsenal into a commanding 2-0 lead on Wednesday night . Arsenal: Martinez 7, Chambers 7, Mertesacker 6.5, Monreal 6.5, Gibbs 6.5, Arteta 6.5 (Flamini 66' 6.5), Oxlade-Chamberlain 7 (Campbell 89'), Ramsey 7, Cazorla 8, Sanchez 7.5, Sanogo 7 (Podolski 78'). Subs not used: Huddart, Koscielny, Rosicky, Bellerin.

Booked: Piszczek, Subotic . Manager: Jurgen Klopp - 6 . MOM: Cazorla . ATT: 59, 902 . Referee: Viktor Kassai - 7 . Ratings by Sami Mokbel at the Emirates . It was Sanchez’s 13th goal in his last 16 games as he continues to rubbish the claim players need time to adjust in England. Where would Arsenal be without him? Wenger may choose not to dwell on that. What was important for the manager was victory after three games without a win, which triggered familiar complaints about his strategy from some quarters. For the 15th consecutive year, he leads his team into the knockout stages of the Champions League and Wenger is fiercely proud of this record. There is even an outside chance of topping the group. There was a clean sheet and an encouraging performance from rookie keeper Damian Martinez but it was not all positive news. Sanogo pulled a hamstring towards the end of the game and captain Mikel Arteta limped off with a calf injury which Wenger admitted ‘looks quite serious’. Injuries have compounded inconsistent form and the squad is stretched to its limits as it enters the busy festive schedule. At least Wenger knows his decision to start with Sanogo was justified. The 21-year-old was included ahead of Lukas Podolski on account of his ability to hold up the ball and bring others into the game, which he did instantly. The game had barely kicked off when Calum Chambers threw him the ball to fight for with his back to goal, near the edge of the Dortmund penalty area. He held off the challenge of Matthias Ginter and flicked a pass to Santi Cazorla, who slipped the ball back to him. In front of goal, Sanogo made no mistake. He looked offside but the flag stayed down. The Emirates Stadium sighed with relief and sang: ‘He scores when he wants!’ Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Sanchez zipped around on the flanks pulling yellow shirts out of line and allowed Aaron Ramsey to slide Sanogo clear again. With a little more time to think, his actions were far less clinical and Ginter had time to recover and make a block. Jurgen Klopp’s team, too fast and furious for Arsenal in Dortmund in the opening game of this campaign, were simply not the same.

Yaya Sanogo (right) wheels away in celebration of his second minute striker against Dortmund on Wednesday night . Sanogo ran straight towards the Arsenal faithful to celebrate his first competitive goal for the Gunners . They, too, have seen confidence eaten away by injuries and languish third from bottom in the Bundesliga, a fact overlooked by those who have decided Klopp should replace Wenger. Dortmund made a sluggish start. It was midway through the first half before they got any toe-hold in the game and began to test Arsenal’s fragile defence. Even then it was not a severe test and Klopp cut an agitated figure on the touchline. For a spell either side of the interval, Ilkay Gundogan enjoyed good possession in midfield and dictated the tempo, often searching to hit Lukasz Piszczek on the overlap. Ciro Immobile was close to connecting with a cross before Henrikh Mkhitaryan collected a nod-down from Piszczek and forced a splendid save from Martinez. Like Sanogo, the keeper had stepped forward when it was required. Martinez thwarted Mkhitaryan again and made late saves, including a terrific one with his right boot from substitute Adrian Ramos.

Henrikh Mkhitaryan (right) sees his first half shot saved by Arsenal goalkeeper Damian Martinez . Dortmund had emerged with greater purpose and adventure after the break but this only helped Arsenal, offering more freedom to Oxlade-Chamberlain, Cazorla and Sanchez as they sprang on the counter-attack. Roman Weidenfeller made a fine save with his left hand to keep out a drive by Sanchez which fizzed across the slick surface, but was stranded by a lob from the Ox moments later. Weidenfeller turned, expecting to see the ball drop into his goal, but it struck woodwork and bounced clear. Oxlade- Chamberlain held his head. The disappointment did not last. Sanchez took a pass from Cazorla in the inside-left area, ducked on to his right foot and curled a shot beyond the diving Dortmund keeper into the far corner. Klopp made changes in a bid to shake a reaction from his team, but they had qualified already and this can play subconsciously. Arsenal have a glimmer of a chance to win the group, but they need to beat Galatasaray and hope Anderlecht win in Dortmund. Until then, Wenger will bank the win and move on to West Bromwich Albion while praying for no more injuries.

Catrina Fox was sitting in the passenger seat as her mother drove on a Colorado highway when she suddenly opened the door and jumped out in the very early hours of Saturday morning. Catrina was hit by a fellow teen who was driving his 2001 PT Cruiser and died at the scene. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Catrina Fox, 17, was being driven by her mother when she jumped out of the passenger seat of the car into oncoming traffic and died . Mystery: Friends and family have no clear answers about why Catrina decided to jump out of the car Saturday . Witnesses saw something on the highway immediately after the crash and swerved to avoid hitting it. After stopping to see what it was, they found the girl's mother, whose name has not been released, distraught trying to understand what happened. 'That's my daughter. Is she alive?' the woman asked Dean Krakel who stopped his car to see what was going on. He said that it was immediately clear that the girl was dead. 'I've never seen anything like that. She just got hit at full speed,' Mr Krakel told The Denver Post. 'It was horrific.' No reasons have been given for why . Catrina jumped out of the car, though police have said that they do not . believe alcohol or drugs were a factor.

"A gruesome image found on a mobile phone showing an embalmer laughing as he holds aloft a severed head was today at the centre of a police investigation. The sickening picture, which features a man named as David Amor smirking at the camera, was on a phone found in a ditch in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, by two young children over the weekend. It is one of three images on the phone that show the decapitated body, believed to have been hit by a train. The disturbing shot is understood to have been taken as 26-year-old Mr Amor worked in a mortuary to preserve the body of the dead man until his funeral could take place. Disturbing: David Amor smiles as he holds aloft the dead man's head in an image stored on a mobile phone that was later found by two children, aged 10 and 12 . Police yesterday launched an investigation into the shocking images. Chief Inspector Olly Wright, of Aylesbury Vale police, said: 'The incident is being treated seriously and while we carry out our initial investigation we feel it would be inappropriate to speculate as to the circumstances in which this photo was taken.' Officers were in the process of seizing the mobile phone so that they could examine the pictures further. A spokesman added: 'We are looking into this to establish whether any offence has taken place.' The phone was found by a brother and sister, aged 12 and 10, who gave it to their . father. He, in an attempt to identify the owner, removed the SIM card . and put it in his own computer. He said: 'It's like when you find a wallet, you look inside to see if there's anything to say who it belongs to. 'However, after finding that, I don't want to get in touch with this guy. It's a total lack of respect for the dead. 'That was probably someone's father, someone's son and someone's brother, it's unbelievable to think they could do that to someone.' The father-of-two, who asked not to be named,  described how his children screamed and ran out of the room when the images appeared on his computer. Also on the phone were lists of Mr Amor's appointments and an electronic business card for his embalming business. Idyllic: The Vale of Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, close to where the phone containing pictures of the decapitated head was found . He advertises his services at £50 pounds for . 'straight cases', and £60 pounds for 'PM' cases. Embalming is the . process by which bodies are preserved so they can be displayed at . the funeral. 'At first I wasn't sure if it was . real, until I started clicking through the rest of them,' said the father. 'It's really upset my daughter, she doesn't want to talk about it or go near the phone, she's really traumatised.' Mr Amor states on a social networking site that his place of work is Amor Embalming. He is understood to live with a cross-dresser, David Hill, in Aylesbury. When questioned at his home, Mr Hill refused to comment about the pictures. Wearing what looked like a blond wig and accompanied by another person who also looked like a man dressed as a . woman, he shouted: 'We don't want to make a comment. No comment. Go away or we are calling the police.' Neighbours last night described Mr Amor's actions with the severed head as 'vile.' 'Its disgusting,' said one man. 'They live here now and I hope it will be ''lived here'' soon.' A spokesman for the British Institute of Embalmers, who have no record of Mr Amor, described his behaviour as a 'shocking' and said the relatives of the dead man would be 'appalled'. Members of the BIE abide by a strict code of ethics that included treating every body with respect, they added. 'If it was one of our members, they'd be on a disciplinary, and thrown out of the institute'' said the spokesman. 'There's no legal requirement to register as an embalmer, and once somebody has done some sort of training they can work as an embalmer.'","Brother and sister aged 10 and 12 found phone with the pictures in a ditch .

"Two of Muhammad Ali's daughters have played down concerns regarding the former heavyweight boxing champion's health. Ali, often regarded as one of the greatest fighters of all time, was diagnosed with Parkinson's syndrome in 1984 and speculation has been rife in recent years that his condition is deteriorating. He appeared frail while attending the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics, while his brother, Rahman, said in an interview in February last year that his sibling could die within days. Ali recently posted a picture on Twitter with the caption: 'Don't believe the hype. Feeling great earlier today' Ali makes a face in New York ahead of his Rumble in the Jungle with George Foreman in 1974 .

"The mega-fight for which the world has been waiting what seems like an eternity may finally happen not just once, but twice. Manny Pacquiao versus Floyd Mayweather is tantalisingly close to becoming reality after the PacMan’s dazzling, rejuvenated performance here in Macau. The target date is May and if Pacquiao were to win the scene would be set for them to do it again next September. Manny Pacquiao (right) dazzled in Macau during his victory against American Chris Algieri . Floyd Mayweather could demand a re-match with Pacquiao should he lose the first proposed bout . Mayweather is believed to be demanding a re-match clause in the contract if he succumbs to the mounting pressure to fight Pacquiao and then loses. That was revealed by Pacquiao’s iconic trainer, Freddie Roach, as he reviewed the prospects for a Mayweather fight before flying back from China to Los Angeles. Roach told me: ‘My understanding is that Floyd is insisting on the re-match if Manny beats him, which I believe he will. That’s okay with us.’ And why not, given the huge amount of money which would be involved? The original projection of boxing’s first $300 million fight will soar to one billion dollars if Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum succeeds in opening up the vast Chinese television market to pay-per-view. Pacquiao's iconic trainer Freddie Roach (left) has reviewed the prospects of a re-match . That would make for not just one but two Billion Dollar Fights if his PacMan beats Mayweather the Money man first time out. Pacquiao put the heat back on Mayweather after decking Chris Algieri no fewer than six times on his way to victory by a record 18 points in the Cotai Arena. That was compiled by his winning of all 12 rounds and the American having half a dozen points deducted for those knock-downs. Job done, world welterweight title retained, Pacuaio then called out Mayweather for the first time, saying: ‘I want this fight and it is time now to give it to all our fans. They deserve to see it.’ One by one the several obstacles raised by Mayweather have been removed, including Pacquiao agreeing to random blood tests for drugs and accepting a 60-40 financial split in favour of his rival for the mythical title of greatest pound-for-pound boxer in the world. Pacquiao dominated his fight with Algieri from the first bell and won convincingly in Macau . Arum, having said that the fight needs to happen if boxing wants to be regarded as a major sport, adds: ‘Enough is enough. Let’s do this. All it needs now is for them to make the call. Me and Manny are waiting to pick up the phone.’ Arum is working also on the rivalry between the two major US cable television networks, HBO who screen Pacquiao’s fights and Showtime who have two fights left on their mega-bucks contract with Mayweather. He is reported to be in talks with CBS, Showtime’s parent company, about them sharing the pay-per-view broadcast in America with HBO, the way they did with Mike Tyson versus Lennox Lewis. That puts the ball in Mayweather’s court. Promoter Bob Arum (left) has been accused of blocking a potential fight between Pacquiao and Mayweather . As Roach says: ‘Floyd is afraid of losing his unbeaten record to Manny. But that’s not what defines greatness. Ali lost, Robinson, lost Leonard lost….but they’re still all-time greats. What counts is fighting the best of your era.’ Correct. It would have been preferable for these two to meet five or six years ago, in their prime, But although Mayweather is 37 and Pacquiao coming up 36 next month, there is still time for the fight, or fights, to be meaningful. Both men live clean, eat healthy and adhere to rigorous training regimes. Given the remarkable physical conditioning made possible by those disciplines, they are still the greatest fighters of their age. Manny’s waiting. Come on Floyd. Let’s get it on. Undefeated Mayweather (left) defeated Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas back in September . Pacquiao shows his softer side after Algieri demolition . Manny Pacquiao will dip into his £20million-plus purse for turning Algieri into a human yo-yo to fund the education of three hundred under-privileged kids in the poor district of the Philippines which he represents as a Congressman. He is paying the school fees as well providing the computers and other equipment. Floyd Mayweather has used a portion of the $40 million he received for September’s repeat victory over Marcos Maidana for his latest glitzy extravagance, the purchase of a gold-plated Bentley golf buggy for his son’s birthday. They are both great fighters but there is one thing Money can’t buy. Class. Pacquiao will fund the education of under-privileged kids in the Philippines with his Algieri winnings . VIDEO Pacquaio delighted with performance . Froch set for a final fling in Las Vegas? Carl Froch’s hopes of ending a stellar ring career with his first fight in the glamorous boxing Mecca of Las Vegas are still alive. Negotiations for him to defend his world super-middleweight titles there against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr seemed to have stalled on a contract dispute between the son of the Mexican legend and his promoter Bob Arum. However, before flying back to Vegas from his successful staging of Manny Pacquiao’s latest victory in Macau, Arum said: ‘Although Chavez wants to move on, we have one fight left on our contract with him. Carl Froch (pictured) could be set for a final fight against Julio Chesar Chavez Jnr . ‘Now he tells us he wants the fight with Froch so if he bites the bullet with us it will happen.’ The delay is expected to push the proposed date of January 31 back to late February or early March. By then the IBF may strip him of their belt for failing to give fellow Brit James DeGale a mandatory defence, even though he has been an exemplary, high-profile champion for that body. But that would still leave his WBA title at stake and Froch will not be railroaded into another domestic scrap, the way he was for two successive mandatories against George Groves.

"Rory McIlroy took a giant leap towards dominating the golfing world by winning the Australian Open last year, so it was fitting that he posed with a baby kangaroo on his return to Sydney on Tuesday. McIlroy endured a dismal year for most of 2013 but is back Down Under looking to defend the title which kick-started his stunning resurgence - the Northern Irishman claimed two majors this year, starred at the Ryder Cup and is the undisputed world No 1. 'Great to be back defending the Australian Open and the Australian Golf Club is looking amazing,' said McIlroy on Twitter as he posed for a picture with a Joey in Sydney Harbour. 'Bring it on!' VIDEO Scroll down to watchAustralia Open day two highlights as Greg Chalmers leads . Rory McIlroy poses with a Joey - a baby kangaroo - in Sydney harbour on Tuesday . If McIlroy performs as well this week as he did in beating home favourite Adam Scott to the title 12 months ago, he'll even have the Aussie galleries jumping for joy. Given McIlroy's brilliant performances this year, which brought major victories in The Open and US PGA Championship plus two other wins, it is hard to believe just how bad 2013 was in comparison. McIlroy struggled to adapt to his new equipment, fell out with his management company and walked off the course during his defence of the Honda Classic, not to mention labelling his own play 'brain dead' when missing the cut in the Open at Muirfield. The 25-year-old had to wait until December to win his first tournament of 2013 at Royal Sydney, denying Scott the triple crown after the Masters champion had won the Australian PGA and Australian Masters.

McIlroy shows off his swing ahead of the tournament, which begins on Thursday . McIlroy hits out of a bunker during his practice round ahead of his final tournament of the year . Twelve months on McIlroy returns to Sydney - albeit a different golf course - already thinking about completing a career grand slam in the Masters next April and brimming with confidence. 'This year has been full of ups and downs, mainly ups, which is a great thing,' said McIlroy, who won the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in May just days after calling off his wedding to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki. 'I learned a lot from it and I feel like I came through this year stronger and wiser, and I can go into 2015 in a much better place. I'm happy with the success that I've had and I feel like there's been a lot that I've learned this year, as well, and that's a great thing going into the future. 'This week's a big week. I want to go down there and play well and do a good job with defending my title. After that I've got a pretty busy week. I'm not playing golf but I've got a few other commitments and things to do. Victory at the Australian Open last year was the springboard to success in 2014 for McIlroy . 'But I'll have a little bit of downtime over Christmas and New Year, which will be nice. I'll start practising again early on in the new year and getting ready for Abu Dhabi.' McIlroy has now spent a total of 56 weeks as world No 1 during his career and feels he has finally come to grips with the responsibility which accompanies such a lofty position. 'I used to be uncomfortable,' added McIlroy, who is in his fifth spell at the top of the rankings. 'You get to the point where there's added scrutiny and there's added criticism or whatever it is. 'But I learned to deal with it. It's just part of the title now, world No 1. That's what it comes with. I've become comfortable with it. 'I've spent more than a year of my career at world No 1, so if I'm not used to it by now, then there's something wrong. I obviously enjoy it. It's where I want to be. I want to be the best player in the world and I want to keep it for as long as I possibly can.'","Rory McIlroy is in Sydney for the Australian Open this week .

"As the cricket world held its breath for Phillip Hughes, one of the few people who can fully understand what he is going through recalled how he defied the most unlikely odds. The life of West Indies batsman Phil Simmons was in danger when he, like the stricken Australian, was struck on the head by a cricket ball — in his case, one propelled by the fast and fiery David Lawrence 26 years ago during a tour match at Bristol. Simmons had emergency brain surgery amid a gloomy prognosis about his future but, remarkably, he was up and out of hospital within eight days. Former West Indies batsman Phil Simmons was struck on the head by a fast ball by David Lawrence in 1988 . Ireland head coach Simmons, who was not wearing a helmet, made a full recovery after the incident . Simmons, pictured in 1993 (left) and 1994 (right), went on to represent West Indies for another nine years . Abbott is reportedly struggling after bowling the bouncer that has left Hughes fighting for his life in a Sydney hospital. Click here to read the full story . Even more remarkably, the Trinidadian, who had made his Test debut earlier that year, went on to play internationally for another nine years and had a full career which now sees him as the highly respected coach of Ireland. When his Test career came to an end in 1997, nine years after the incident which almost claimed his life, Simmons had played in 26 matches for West Indies, the same number of appearances Hughes has made for Australia. ‘I was the same age as Phil Hughes and a fit young man like him, which I think can make a big difference,’ Simmons told Sportsmail from Dubai, where Ireland are preparing for the World Cup. ‘The big thing for me was my wife,’ said Simmons. ‘She would not allow any negativity about my situation. Everything had to be positive. I was going to pull through and I was going to play for the West Indies again. ‘She didn’t let me read any of the stuff which said I might not make it, so it never entered my head. It was only later when I realised quite how severe it all was.’ The concern for Simmons, who was playing for the West Indies tourists of 1988 against Gloucestershire, was just as acute as that for poor Hughes, whose condition remains critical in a Sydney hospital. He was hit on the back of the head playing for South Australia against New South Wales at the SCG. Hughes was treated on the pitch at the SCG after being struck in the head by a short ball on Tuesday . Former Australia cricketer Brett Lee arrives at St Vincent's Hospital to visit  Hughes on Wednesday . The cricketing world has been showing its support for Hughes, including former Australia cricketer Lee . Australian cricket team doctor Peter Brukner has been told that Hughes remains in a critical condition . ‘My injury was as serious as can be,’ said Simmons who, unlike Hughes, was not wearing a helmet at the time of his horrific accident. ‘My heart stopped and I had a clot removed from my brain. I was in a long-term head unit in hospital in Bristol and no-one expected me to play again but I was out in eight days. I really hope this kid pulls through.’ The only difference between the two incidents is that Simmons’s injury could have been avoided had he been wearing a protective helmet but Hughes was the victim of a freak occurrence, with the ball from New South Wales medium-fast bowler Sean Abbott hitting him on the back of his head below his helmet. ‘Phil is so unlucky,’ said Simmons. ‘It’s a million to one shot that someone will be hit where he was and you can’t blame the helmet. They have improved dramatically since my day and the reality is that there will always be a risk in cricket. It’s just one of those things that can happen, like it did to me.’ Simmons was hit by one of the fastest bowlers around at that time in ‘Syd’ Lawrence, who was to suffer serious injury himself four years later, when his knee snapped in his delivery stride. The former England bowler is now a body builder. Brukner speaks to the media at St Vincent's Hospital as Hughes underwent scans on Wednesday morning . One Direction's Harry Styles tweeted his support and got nearly 50,000 retweets on Wednesday . ‘I know how bowlers can be affected by this which is why everyone is rallying around Sean Abbott,’ said Simmons. ‘I had known Syd for a long time before the incident and we were good friends. ‘I was unconscious when he came to visit me in hospital in Bristol but my wife told me he had a tear running down his cheek when he held my hand. A bowler is never to blame. This is just something that can happen in our game but thankfully it is very rare.’ Simmons’s extraordinary recovery saw him playing again four months after the incident, while he resumed his career at the highest level — this time with a helmet — a year later. ‘Of course I was nervous when I first started playing again but facing fast bowling is what I did and it came back to me pretty quickly. ‘There is nothing we can all do other than pray for Phil Hughes. My wife rang me as soon as she heard what had happened to him because it brought it all back. ‘He is in the best possible hands and the doctors will be doing all they can for him. All we can do is hope he makes a full recovery. I am proof that it can happen.’ Wednesday's Daily Telegraph in Australia write 'The day cricket stopped' on their back page . Wednesday's Daily Telegraph in Australia and the Herald Sun are both praying for Hughes .","Phillip Hughes remains in critical condition after being struck on the head by a ball from Sean Abbott .

"Kirani James was described as a 'specimen' by one of his 400 metres rivals on Tuesday and showed just why on a nippy Glasgow night 24 hours later, breaking the Commonwealth Games record with ease. The 21-year-old from Grenada is one of the athletics world's most impressive performers right now thanks to his fine displays in the one-lap sprint. James continued that incredible form this week at Hampden Park, where he cruised through the heats and semi-finals before breaking Iwan Thomas' Games record set in 1998. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Commonwealth Games: Day 7 review . Sparkling run: James pushed on in the final 100m to see off the challenge of South African Van Niekerk . Comfortable: The Grenada athlete has won every title available to him at the age of just 21 . Touch the sky: A tear runs down James' cheek as he points to the heavens after storming to 400m victory . Crossing the line in 44.24 seconds, his victory in the final saw him complete a full set of world youth, world junior, world, Olympic and Commonwealth titles - all staggeringly achieved in the space of five years. It is no wonder England's Martyn Rooney called him a 'specimen' on the eve of the final in Glasgow, where 400m world-record holder Michael Johnson was watching on from the stands. So, having broken the Commonwealth Games record, is he now eyeing the American's long-standing record of 43.18 secs? 'Not really,' James said after the race. 'I am going to be 22 in September. 'Michael Johnson set the record when he was 32 so I have got 10 years to work with. I've got a lot of things to work on. I've got to build up my power. 'You know, I just want to try and get better and just try to come here and represent my country.' Making his country proud: James holds a Grenada flag while doing a lap of honour at Hampden Park . VIDEO Commonwealth Games: Day 7 review . James has dipped under 44 seconds twice this year, including his Central American record run of 43.74 secs. That run in Lausanne earlier this month was the fastest 400m sprint of the year and he increasingly looks on the cusp of something special. 'My main thing is to come out here and represent my country,' James said. 'I don't really look at all of those other things. As long as I do that and win the title, I am happy with that.' Fortunately for the athletics fans of Britain, this victory is not the last time James will grace the track in Glasgow as he still has the 4x400m relay to come. Gone but not forgotten: Iwan Thomas, whose record Kirani James broke, tweeted congratulating him . Competitors and spectators alike will be hoping for slightly better weather when that comes around, although James does not seem to give a hoot. 'Everybody has to deal with the weather so you just have to do it and try your best,' he said. 'It is not anybody's fault that the weather is the way it is. It is just how it is. 'We just have to run through it, not to think about it. It is really just an excuse for guys who don't really believe in themselves and how they are going to perform.'

Didier Drogba posted a picture of Chelsea's players looking happy as they flew back to England yesterday . 'Everything was under control and the result was the consequence of one team playing a fantastic match. 'This was the whole 90 minutes. The team were so solid. If anything, in the first half, we could have scored more goals. 'In this moment, we are very confident. We go step by step with this mentality. The players are very serious. 'Everything they do with big focus and ambition, but at the same time with this component, which is quite something new in Chelsea football: this happiness, this flair, this beauty. 'The way they are doing things, we are very happy. We are having good results and playing really, really well at this moment.' Mourinho declared his happiness at his side's performance after the match as they qualified for the last 16 . It was hard for Di Matteo against his former club and he stormed straight down the tunnel at the final whistle. 'The best comfort they can have is that they lost to the best team,' said Mourinho. 'A team who gave them no chances. From the first minute, Chelsea were so strong. 'When you lose a match against a team who put in a perfect performance, you have to move on. Accept the opponent was better. It was not their fault. 'They must be very sad with this result, but my experience tells me that when we lose against a team who is much better than us, you have to accept it. They have to accept we were too strong for them.' The Chelsea boss hoped it might be a display to end the theories that he is a manager who can only succeed with defensive strategies. Chelsea midfielder Willian (centre) scored the Blues' second in their romp against Schalke . He added: 'Sometimes people who don't understand a lot about football try to put a stamp on a manager: this manager is this, this manager is that. The good ones adapt to reality. 'In this moment, this team is completely different to my team in 2004-08. Completely different. Different players. Different profile. So we play a different football. 'As I was saying, this team, to be so good or better than other Chelsea teams, this team needs to win. At this moment: zero titles. 'We have to transform the quality of our game into results, which we are getting now. But we have to try and win things so this team goes down in Chelsea's history as a brilliant team who won something.'

"A star was born in Colombo – but Moeen Ali’s twinkling century could not save England in the first one-day international against Sri Lanka. As Ali caressed his way to the third-fastest one-day hundred by an England batsman, it felt like caviar and champagne compared with the top-order stodge that has too often weighed them down. But, of the rest, only Ravi Bopara could pass 35. And if that spoke volumes for the quality of Ali’s innings, then it also confirmed a familiar tale: not for the first time, England’s 50-over team had come up short. Sri Lanka's players celebrate after sealing their 25-run victory over England in Colombo . Chris Woakes opened the bowling for England but Tillakaratne Dilshan (right) gave him a torrid time . Set 318, more than they have ever chased to win a one-dayer, they were all out for 292. Close, but no cigar. For Ali, though, this could be the start of something special. Back in June against the same opponents, he had exhibited his more stoical side, batting virtually all day to take England to the brink of a famous draw in a Test at Headingley. Now he vindicated the management’s decision to promote him to the opener’s role, carving his first delivery over the covers and barely pausing for breath en route to a 25-ball half-century. Dilshan (left) goes inside out over the covers as he gets Sri Lanka off to a flying start . Kusal Perera also produced some lusty blows at the beginning of the Sri Lanka innings . Perera (centre) was the first Sri Lanka batsman to go, run out by Joe Root . Alastair Cook holds his head after a chance goes begging in the Sri Lanka innings . On Friday, across town at the Sinhalese Sports Club, Ali had got there in 21 balls, smiting the first six of them to the fence. The magic had not deserted him. ‘He has an amazing ability to time a cricket ball from the word go,’ said Alastair Cook. ‘It was extraordinary. It’s just frustrating not to win a game when you have a hundred like that.’ Ali was lucky to survive on seven, when the ball rolled back on to the stumps without shifting a bail, and again on 72, when Jeevan Mendis spilled a straightforward chance at deep midwicket. But the plea from England’s new batting coach Mark Ramprakash has been to loosen shackles – and that is rarely achieved without a risk or two. Ali understands this, and it was a joy to watch him use his feet to lift left-arm spinner Rangana Herath for successive leg-side sixes. His century needed just 72 balls: only Jos Buttler and Kevin Pietersen have scored faster one-day hundreds for England. It was as if, said Mathews, he was ‘batting on a different pitch’. In the end, Ali had to settle for 119 off 87 after a providing leg-spinner Mendis with an anticlimactic return catch. Yet what, you wondered, might he have achieved had anyone been able to stay with him? In some cases, the contrast was almost painful. Twice in two balls during the first over, Cook was given out leg-before to his opposite number Angelo Mathews. Twice he asked for reviews, with Ali his advisor from the non-striker’s end; twice Hawk-Eye ruled the ball was going over the stumps. By the time Cook was given out leg-before a third time – to the first ball of spin sent down by Sri Lanka from Tillakeratne Dilshan – he had contributed a scratchy 10 from 17 balls.

The England opener was in irresistible form and clubs another ball for four . Jos Buttler 61 balls vs Sri Lanka 2014 . Kevin Pietersen 69 balls vs Australia 2005 . Moeen Ali 72 balls vs Sri Lanka 2014 . The England captain has now gone 40 one-day innings without a century, yet his status continues to protect him against the more persuasive claims of Alex Hales. For Michael Vaughan, one of Cook’s predecessors, it was all too much. ‘Please please England,’ he tweeted. ‘Allow ‪@AlexHales1 to open with Mo....’ Ian Bell made a pleasant run-a-ball 35 before nibbling at Thisara Perera’s bustling seam, but failures for Joe Root and Eoin Morgan – who has gone 13 innings without a fifty – meant Ali had to slow down and take stock. Ian Bell gave Moeen support after Cook's dismissal and here punches one through the off-side . Thisara Perera (left) celebrates after having Bell caught at slip and breaking the partnership . And when Buttler chopped Dhammika Prasad on to his stumps for 21, England had lost four for 52. Bopara, back in the side at the expense of Chris Jordan, did his best, but the damage had been done. Eoin Morgan is bowled all ends up by Ajantha Mendis for just one . Jos Buttler looks back in dismay after playing on to leave England five down . Moeen raises his bat and takes off his helmet after scoring his maiden ODI century for England . Earlier, the England attack – without Steve Finn, who was nursing a groin niggle – fell apart as Tillakeratne Dilshan’s 88, plus fifties for opener Kusal Perera and Mahela Jayawardene helped Sri Lanka to an imposing 317 for six. James Tredwell’s off-breaks were steady under fire, and Chris Woakes looked menacing until his last over leaked 21. But Harry Gurney gave away 66, and Ben Stokes 36 in four overs. Why Bopara was given only four overs himself – going for a relatively miserly 15 – was a mystery. Just as concerning was that England bowled 17 wides. For a while, it looked as if these flaws might be forgotten and forgiven. But Ali was running out of partners. Soon, both he and England ran out of luck. Ben Stokes plays a watchful shot down the ground during his scratchy innings . Ravi Bopara nurdles one round the corner as he tries to increase the tempo for the tourists . Stokes looks behind him as he is stumped by Sangakkara off the bowling of Ranaga Herath . Bopara hits a six on his way to a half century but despite his efforts England fell short . The second delivery brought what seemed a costly slip by Ben Stokes at long-on, his fumble allowing Mathews to get back on strike for a two - and he then hit the next two balls for six. But the Sri Lanka captain's bid for a hat-trick of maximums foundered when Stokes held his nerve under a high ball at long on. Tredwell then strangled Jayawardene caught-behind down the leg-side, and it was he instead on a hat-trick - a curiosity feat he must try to complete in England's next match. For the second time in the innings, England had taken two wickets in quick succession - an effective stalling mechanism, until late hitting from Jeevan Mendis helped to plunder an ultimately telling 54 in the last five overs.","Moeen Ali scores third-quickest ODI hundred by an England batsman .

"When Cesc Fabregas claims he is playing the best football of his life, it is worth pausing to place it in context. This is Fabregas, the star of an attractive Arsenal side who passed and moved to the Champions League final, a Catalan who spent three years with Lionel Messi and Co at Barcelona and who conquered the world with Spain in 2010. And, yet, in four months at Chelsea he already seems like he was born to be Jose Mourinho’s tempo-setter in a team committed to entertain and hell-bent on winning. Cesc Fabregas believes he is playing the best football of his career at Chelsea right now . The Spaniard (left) passes the ball while being challenged by Schalke's Kevin-Prince Boateng on Tuesday . ‘I feel in control and that’s what I like the most in football,’ said Fabregas. ‘I touch the ball all the time, I feel happy, I go and get the ball from here, from there, I can go forward, Oscar drops deep. I feel free, I feel confident. ‘Sometimes in the last three or four years in the national team and Barcelona, I was playing like a No 9. I mean, I have to do it for the team and I enjoy it, and it’s all good. But, here, where I am playing today, in these games, it’s where I enjoy my football the most. I feel right now I am playing some of the best football of my career. ‘I’ve played in World Cup finals, European Championship finals, Champions League finals with great teams. I’m not saying the (last two) games against West Brom or Schalke were the best, probably they weren’t, but definitely they were games I enjoyed a lot.’ Then the inner Mourinho kicks in. Fabregas has a winning mentality, a touch of devilment, perhaps a selfish streak, which is sure to appeal to his latest manager. Fabregas once again starred in an emphatic Chelsea win - they beat the German side 5-0 at the Veltins Arena . The midfielder plays a dink pass into the penalty area during Chelsea's Champions League victory . ‘I didn’t just come here to play well and that’s it,’ he said. ‘I came to win trophies. If I can play well and enjoy myself, the better. ‘We have to win trophies. No-one remembers a great, great team if you don’t. We have to win and that will say a lot from us and people will judge it how they want to judge it. The most important thing is to keep it going and at the end of the season we can talk.’ Fabregas has yet to lose a game with Chelsea. They are clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League, safely into the last 16 of the Champions League and are Capital One Cup quarter-finalists. Mourinho’s team have barely offered a glimpse of weakness, from swatting aside Burnley on the opening day to the destruction of Schalke in Germany on Tuesday. John Terry (centre) celebrates with Fabregas (left) and Cahill after Chelsea's second goal on Tuesday . Fabregas tries to run away from a tackle as Schalke's Felipe Santana advances on top of him . Who can beat them? How many trophies can they collect this year? It is difficult to see who might stop them, but Fabregas said: ‘We go on by not agreeing with the assumption. We know people say how great Chelsea is, how good they are playing, how we have won the title, but it is just not happening this way in the dressing room. ‘It’s a long way to go, especially with the Christmas period. We will play Southampton and Tottenham away, you can drop points. Why not? It can happen. ‘This is the toughest league in the world. Everyone else is having holidays, as I did in the last three years. Trust me, it helps a lot. ‘It is not the same going into the Champions League knockout stages after 10 days on holiday in Dubai as it is playing every two or three days in the Premier League. We will have to cope with it. I believe we have the squad to cope with it, 100 per cent, no excuses.’ Chelsea celebrate on their way to a victory which sees them into the knockout stages as group winners . Fabregas and Diego Costa stirred controversy in Spain when they pulled out of international duty only to both be fit for Chelsea’s 2-0 win against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. It prompted questions about commitment from some quarters, including Sergio Ramos. Fabregas called the Real Madrid defender to set the record straight. ‘I have played 94 games for Spain,’ said the 27-year-old Chelsea midfielder. ‘I’ve been going for nine years, always, and with a big smile. We spoke on the phone. I told him we have played together since Under 21s and there is no need for him to send messages through the press. I told him to call me up and say it to my face. Everything is fine.’","Chelsea beat Schalke 5-0 at the Veltins Arena in the Champions League .

"Charismatic Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp saw the funny side of his team's current predicament when trying to explain their injury crisis ahead of taking on Arsenal at the Emirates on Wednesday evening. The Gunners know a draw against Dortmund will ensure progression to the knockout stages of the Champions League having drawn 3-3 with Anderlecht in the Champions League last month before losing to Swansea City and Manchester United in the Premier League. There hasn't been much for Klopp to laugh about with his side languishing in the Bundesliga's bottom three following a 2-2 draw with minnows Paderborn on Saturday. Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp broke down in laughter during his press conference . The German broke down in hysterics trying to translate a well known German phrase to journalists . The 47-year-old was in high spirits despite his side's struggles in the Bundesliga so far this season . Star names Marco Reus, Ilkay Gundogan, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan have all had spells on the sidelines but instead of churning out the usual platitudes at his Champions League press conference on Tuesday, the German offered up his own unique way of describing the situation. 'We know about the reasons but we've also had injuries with the foot that we've never heard about. Sometimes one comes through the other,' said Klopp, before bursting into laughter. Journalists were lost as to what Klopp's explanation could mean and the 47-year-old responded: 'You don't understand? What a pity? 'You should learn, there's a very good German explanation for some problems, Alles hat eine ende nur die wurst hat zwei ' - but Klopp couldn't pick out the right translation and needed an interpreter to explain 'everything has an end except for a sausage has two.' Klopp, conducting training at Arsenal's Emirates stadium on Tuesday, sees the Arsenal clash as a 'holiday' Klopp had the press room in stitches but managed to compose himself to continue: 'With injuries, they start to play and the next thing, [there is] another problem. If you look at Marco Reus, all the injuries are because of that. 'It is a problem for the players with no injuries, too, because they have to play all the time. 'I can't have a squad with 45 players. It is not a problem with training. We didn't get silly over the past year. We know how to train.' The injury-hit Dortmund squad trained at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night . The German side have performed well in the Champions League this season, already qualifying for the last 16 . VIDEO Klopp enjoying European escape . As a consequence of Dortmund's Bundesliga troubles, Klopp is relishing taking on the Gunners, as the Champions League has been a happy hunting ground for his side so far this campaign. 'Now, I can't change the Bundesliga situation,' he said. 'It is little bit like a holiday for me. It is only the Champions League. But Bundesliga, we go back to that on Sunday.' Despite his comical side, Klopp is serious when he says he takes the blame for their slump in the Bundesliga. 'I feel maximum responsibility for this because it is easy to celebrate victories together, it is easy to feel responsible for winning games,' Klopp continued. 'It is much more difficult to handle this feeling now because I am responsible, of course. Sometimes I make mistakes. All the faults together is my responsibility, for sure.'","Arsenal play Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Wednesday .

"Supporters of the three biggest clubs in Spain were not surprised to see the images of Sergio Aguero destroying Bayern Munich on Wednesday morning. Barcelona and Real Madrid fans still wish their clubs had moved for him in 2011 and Atletico Madrid supporters will never forget the way his goals got them back into the Champions League and made them believe they could mix it with the top two. Fate has kept Aguero out of the clutches of Real Madrid and Barcelona just as injuries have kept him off the Ballon d’Or podium but no-one in Spain or in his native Argentina believes the Manchester City striker is, on his day, any less of a player than Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. This season he has scored 17 of City's 38 goals - that's a greater percentage of his team's goals than both Ronaldo and Messi. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sergio Aguero scoring for Argentina against Germany . Sergio Aguero showed on Tuesday night why he is considered as one of the world's best players . Aguero celebrates after scoring his third goal in a superb individual display against Bayern Munich . The hat-trick on Tuesday night showed again why Aguero is compared with Messi and Ronaldo . The Argentinian striker has been recognised as a top striker since his prolific spell at Atletico Madrid . That inability to play game after game, season after season has been the only thing that has kept him a notch below La Liga’s greatest. How different things might have been in the World Cup final if Aguero had been fit to partner his old friend Messi against Germany. Aguero and Messi’s friendship goes back to 2005 when they played at the World Youth Cup in Holland together. They were room-mates, friends and strike partners as Argentina won Olympic Gold in 2008. The pair also became fathers around the same time and Messi’s son Thiago plays with Aguero’s boy Benjamin whenever the two get together. Messi wanted Aguero to join him at Barcelona three years ago but Barcelona had just won the European Cup with David Villa and Pedro scoring in the final – the timing was wrong. Aguero takes on two Barcelona defenders, including captain Carles Puyol, during his time at Atletico . Lionel Messi celebrates with Aguero during the 2008 Olympics when they became friends and strike partners . Aguero has a fantastic scoring record for club and country but has always been hampered by injuries . Barcelona paper Sport ran a story that summer stating Real Madrid would have signed Aguero had he switched agents and joined Jose Mourinho’s representative Jorge Mendes. Mourinho was never entirely convinced by Gonzalo Higuain, had reservations at the time about Karim Benzema and wanted the then 23-year-old Aguero. Bernabeu president Florentino Perez was ready to break a pact with city rivals Atletico to not sign their players, such was his desire to land Aguero who believed Real were set to move for him. The player boldly announced he was leaving Atletico but the move never transpired and Aguero ended up at Manchester City. Perez still wants the player so many in Spain liken to Romario – bull-like strength; so difficult to knock off the ball; the most complete of finishers. Despite his final-hour dalliance with Real Madrid, Atletico supporters will never lose their respect for Aguero. In the 2007-08 season he was La Liga’s outstanding player, taking Atletico to the Champions League for the first time in 11 years. They won the Europa League with him in 2010 a year before he left. The Manchester City striker scored against Germany in a friendly this year... but missed the World Cup final . A fresh-faced Aguero signed for Atletico in 2006, and has long been a target for their city rivals Real Madrid . ‘Always fight to the end,’ was Aguero’s post-match message in a tweet after he had single-handedly kept Manchester City in the Champions League. He is best understood in his homeland as a battleship of a player who never gives in and has the character to match his talent. This is a player who never had the luxury Messi enjoyed of turning up in Barcelona aged 12 and being allowed to gradually adapt as he moved up through the youth ranks. Aguero was thrown in at the deep end at boyhood club Independiente, making his debut as a 15-year-old. They still love him there – the goal he scored from the halfway line in a 4-0 win over local rivals Racing Club de Avellaneda in 2005 remains many fans’ all-time favourite. They would welcome him back, as would the supporters of Atletico Madrid. The Real Madrid faithful have not given up hope that Perez can land him next summer and there are Barcelona fans who feel, as good as Neymar is, that Aguero would have been a cheaper option back in 2011. Aguero scores the winning goal against QPR in 2012 to win Manchester City their first Premier League title . A superb finisher with bull-like strength, Aguero is often compared with Brazilian legend Romario . VIDEO Pellegrini proud of City fightback . Aguero scores his second against Bayern on Tuesday night during a display of fabulous finishing . As Martin Samuel wrote in his match report after City's win over Bayern on Tuesday night: 'Aguero is every bit as important to them as Luis Suarez was to Liverpool last year or Gareth Bale to Tottenham Hotspur the year before.' If he were to move on like those two, he could command a fee more than the world-record £86m Bale cost Madrid and well over the £75m Barcelona paid for Suarez. Because both those deals have been done it may be that once again neither club makes a move for ‘el Kun’. And if destiny goes on keeping him out of the grasp of Spain’s big two, the biggest winner will continue to be Manchester City.

'We want to compete in every competition and we needed the points tonight. 'We have a difficult last game against a team (Paris Saint-Germain) that we know very well because we played them last season and this season too.

"There will come a time when Arsenal will seriously start thinking about the man to succeed Arsene Wenger. That moment just hasn’t arrived yet. Make no mistake the club’s chief executive Ivan Gazidis was as worried as the 60,000 Arsenal fans who had to swallow another defeat against Manchester United at the Emirates last Saturday. Gazidis, unlike a cerebral caller to talkSPORT pleading with Wenger to walk away on Monday evening, has been playing a straight bat in public. Jurgen Klopp (left), who has been touted to replace Arsene Wenger, shook hands with the Frenchman . Yaya Sanogo gave Arsenal an early lead which they never looked like relinquishing . Alexis Sanchez doubled the lead to give the Gunners breathing space against last season's runners-up . This, then, was the chance for Wenger to hit the critics for six after successive defeats in the Barclays Premier League against Swansea and United. A goal, scored by Yaya Sanogo just 74 seconds after the start of this Group D clash with Borussia Dortmund, completely altered the atmosphere at the Emirates. Let’s not pretend otherwise because a vast number of Arsenal supporters, and others outside of this parish, have been braying for Jurgen Klopp to replace Wenger. Taking Dortmund’s players for a training session on a muddy surface at Regent’s Park is part of his unorthodox methods. Wenger, as we are all too aware, knows only one way. In the sanctuary of the dressing room, there are a growing number of players who want Wenger to change his ways and adapt to the demands of the modern game. They want a different approach, better coaching at the back and more advice on technique and tactics. They are not getting enough of it. When he was leading the team to three Barclays Premier League titles he appeared to be ahead of the game. Now he has fallen behind it. Wenger poses with the Premier League trophy in 2004, the last time he won the title with Arsenal . Wenger has taken Arsenal to the last 16 of the Champions League for 15 consecutive seasons . Unquestionably the aura has diminished and it will take more than a victory in the FA Cup final against Hull last season for the aura to return. He is not a quitter and never has been after a career that has taken him to north London via Nancy, Monaco and Grampus Eight. Despite the flirtations with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and England over the years — all designed to strengthen his hand at Arsenal — Wenger has never once properly considered breaking a contract with this club. In recent weeks there has been an appetite for change among the fans and even the most loyal — the ‘AKBs’, or Arsene Knows Best brigade — have been on the turn of late. Wenger, though, is unmoved. In his programme notes he spoke of the solidarity in the squad and made a point of referencing Klopp’s poor run with Dortmund. For all the love showered on the quirky German coach, Dortmund are in the relegation zone in Bundesliga. Last year they competed in the Champions League final, only beaten at Wembley by the brilliance of Arjen Robben when he scored Bayern Munich’s 89th minute winner. Arjen Robben pounces to give Bayern Munich their fifth European Cup, breaking Dortmund's hearts at Wembley . Klopp has the glare of many camera lenses on him as  Dortmund relinquish their 100 per cent record in Group D . Then, they were upwardly mobile, a team to be feared after beating Real Madrid — once in the group stage and again in the semi-final — on the way to Wembley. In a few weeks’ time, at UEFA HQ in Nyon, the balls will be drawn out of the pots for the Champions League second round ties. Between now and then Arsenal have a run of fixtures in the Premier League — against West Brom, Southampton, Stoke City and Newcastle — which could see them start creeping their way back towards the top four. This Champions League win, sealed by a moment of class from their one genuine great Alexis Sanchez, meant an awful lot to Wenger judging by his reaction to a special goal. He was pumping his fists on the edge of the technical area, waiting to salute the forward as he made his way back to the halfway line. Wenger paid £30million for Sanchez and he certainly knows how to finish a job.

Luke Shaw (ankle), Daley Blind (knee), Marcos Rojo (shoulder), Rafael (groin), Radamel Falcao (ankle), Jesse Lingard (knee) Pereira grabbed a third when Blackburn's goalkeeper failed to get a solid hand on to his 20-yard effort before Rothwell hit a double.

"Sugar is a poison and its sale should be as tightly regulated as cigarettes and alcohol, scientists say. They warn that sugary foods and drinks are responsible for illnesses including obesity, heart disease, cancer and liver problems. And they claim it contributes to 35million deaths a year worldwide and is so dangerous it should be controlled through taxation and legislation. Sugar is 'toxic' beyond its calories, warn scientists. They suggest a sales tax licensing requirements on vending machines . In an article entitled The Toxic Truth . About Sugar, published in the journal  Nature, the scientists add: ‘A . little is not a problem but a lot kills – slowly.’ The U.S. authors warn obesity is now a . bigger problem than malnourishment across the world, and that sugar not . only makes people fat but also changes the body’s metabolism, raises . blood pressure, throws hormones off balance and harms the liver. The damage done mirrors the effects of . drinking too much alcohol – which the scientists point out is made from . distilling sugar. The authors, led by Robert Lustig, a . childhood obesity expert at California University, say that, like . alcohol, sugar is widely available, toxic, easily abused and harmful to . society. They say teaching children about diet . and exercise is unlikely to be effective and instead the answer lies in . taxes and restricting availability. The study recommends using taxation . to double the price of fizzy drinks, restricting their sale to those . over 17 or 18, and tightening regulations covering school vending . machines and snack bars. Dr Laura Schmidt, also of California . University, said: ‘We’re not talking about prohibition. We’re not . advocating a major imposition of the government into people’s lives. ‘What we want is actually to increase . people’s choices by making foods that aren’t loaded with sugar . comparatively easier and cheaper to get.’ The article also reveals that . consumption of sugar has tripled in the past 50 years and that there are . now more obese people than malnourished ones across the world. It concludes that responsibility lies . with the food companies, saying that while they may resist change, . shifts in policy are possible if the pressure is great enough. Examples . include the ban on smoking in public places and the fitting of airbags . in cars. The article ends: ‘These simple . measures are taken for granted as tools for our public health and . well-being. It’s time to turn our attention to sugar.’ However, other scientists have . described the essay as ‘puritanical’, saying sugar is only toxic when . eaten in unrealistic amounts. Barbara Gallani, of the Food and Drink . Federation, which represents the UK food and drink industry, said that . while urgent action was needed to beat heart and other diseases, it was . wrong to focus on sugar alone. She added: ‘The causes of these . diseases are multi-factorial and demonising food components does not . help consumers to build a realistic approach to their diet. ‘The key to good health is a balanced and varied diet in a lifestyle that includes plenty of physical activity.’","'A little is not a problem but a lot kills - slowly'

"It’s turning out to be a few days to forget for Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez. After failing to help his side beat Manchester United in their Premier League encounter on Saturday, the forward has now been accused of texting a former Miss Chile behind his girlfriend’s back. Ahead of the Gunners’ crucial Champions League tie at home to Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday, Camila Andrade claims the 25-year-old’s messages include holiday snaps and invitations to dine with him. Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez has been accused of texting a former Miss Chile behind his girlfriend's back . Camila Andrade (left) has accused  Sanchez (right, with his girlfriend Laia Grassi) of texting her . Andrade has explained how she turned down the £30million signing when he invited her out to dinner during Chile’s World Cup preparation this summer before he was pictured on a romantic beach holiday in Mexico with his current girlfriend Laia Grassi. MailOnline has been unable to verify whether Miss Andrade can support her claims and attempts to contact Sanchez for comment have failed to elicit a response. In reports which have made headlines across the media in Chile, Miss Andrade, 23, told an interviewer in her home country how he asked her out earlier this year. She said: ‘Alexis invited me out for a meal while he was back in Chile preparing for the World Cup. ‘I was between boyfriends at the time and it was the first time that he’d asked if we could meet up. Andrade  claims she turned down the £30million Arsenal forward when he invited her out to dinner during his World Cup preparation weeks before he was pictured on a romantic beach holiday in Mexico with Grassi . ‘I turned him down because he wasn’t my type and I knew that many of the times he’d messaged me he was with his girlfriend and I liked that even less. ‘When he was in Disneyland Paris with Laia in February he sent me a picture of himself on his own. ‘I knew he was with her because I’d seen pictures in the paper and I really couldn’t stop laughing. ‘I messaged him to say: “How nice, you’re with your girlfriend, I’ve love to be where you are with my boyfriend” and he replied: “No I’m with my little nephew or young cousin or some young relative”, I can’t remember exactly. ‘He never said he was with his girlfriend and the following day there was a big picture in the paper of the two of them. It was very strange. ‘All these starstruck young girls need to see all these footballers are the same and are not to be believed.’ Andrade claims Sanchez sent her a WhatsApp message out of the blue just after she won Miss Chile . Miss Andrade said 'starstruck  girls need to see all these footballers are the same and not to be believed' It’s not the first time Sanchez has made headlines off the pitch. Spanish art director and designer Laia stuck by the Premier League marksman, who has scored six goals in his last four games, when an old squeeze claimed she was pregnant with the football star’s child. The day after Barcelona-based Mary Plaza, 28, made her pregnancy claim in April Laia posted a picture of her and Alexis on her Instagram page with the message: ‘Amor Verdadero’ - Spanish for ‘True Love.’ Another ex, Brazilian model Michelle Carvalho, claimed last year the blue-eyed Spanish blonde, who posed in an Arsenal shirt on her Instagram page after Alexis joined the Gunners in July, was fooling herself if she thought she was the love of his life. She said: ‘I don’t think it’s anything stable, I think it’s a passing thing. He only wants a good time.’ Andrade also claims Sanchez sent her photos claiming he was with a younger relative and not Grassi (right) Miss Andrade, who narrowly missed out on the Miss World finals after being chosen as her nation’s most beautiful woman in July last year, said the footballer sent her a WhatsApp message out of the blue just after she won Miss Chile. She revealed: ‘I was with an ex-boyfriend when he sent his first message. ‘I’d never met him in my life so when he said he was Alexis Sanchez, I replied saying: “No, you’re lying, you know what, Ciao.” ‘He responded by phoning me straight away. I didn’t answer him. I rejected the call. ‘Why am I going to answer him if I don’t know him? And then he sent me a message saying I phoned you so you’d know it was me.’ Sanchez played in Arsenal's  2-1 Premier League defeat to Manchester United on Saturday evening . She added: ‘I’ve no idea how he got my number but he did what a lot of footballers like him do which is to speak to girls via WhatsApp. ‘I don’t want to go into so much detail, but I have to say he seemed very kind and very funny. ‘It makes me laugh how all the young girls speak to him. I could never ever have taken seriously some of the things he said to me. ‘We never had regular conversations but I stopped answering him about two months ago after I turned down his meal invite. ‘I found it tasteless he’d ask me out while he was with someone else so I gave him the red card. Sanchez took part in Arsenal training on Tuesday ahead of their Champions League tie against Dortmund . ‘When someone doesn’t answer you, I think the other person normally gets it and understands that you don’t want to speak with them. ‘Nothing happened between Alexis and me and I’m doing nothing wrong by revealing how he’s been messaging me. ‘But if I had said “yes” that time he phoned me and invited me out for a meal, I can assure you nobody would have found out.’ Sanchez has not yet responded to a request for comment from MailOnline.

"A players’ meeting called after the fourth successive Ashes defeat emerged on Wednesday as the pivotal event leading to Kevin Pietersen becoming an England outcast. The summit in Melbourne — without team management present — was the idea of Matt Prior, the England vice-captain who had been dropped after the Ashes were lost in Perth. Prior, who regards the England team ethic as all-important, still wanted an opportunity for the players to discuss without fear of recrimination how they could improve dressing-room morale and the team environment. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Piers Morgan trying to get out of the way a Brett Lee over . Critic: Pietersen told Andy Flower the issues that the England players had with his management . Hitting out: Matt Prior has blasted accusations from Kevin Pietersen's friend Piers Morgan . Tough time: Prior struggled in Australia and was dropped after the third Test . The consensus within the squad was . that England team director Andy Flower had been too much of a . ‘headmaster figure’ during the tour and needed to relax his iron grip to . get the best out of the team. It . was after the meeting following the Boxing Day Test defeat that . Pietersen, rather than captain Alastair Cook, took it on himself to tell . Flower where the players felt he was going wrong. The . ECB have refused to clarify the details of the fallout because of legal . complications, including confidentially clauses in the Pietersen . settlement. But this version . of events from inside the dressing room tallies with that of the . Pietersen camp, who maintain that their man was the only player prepared . to tell Flower some home truths. It . also brings some context to the explosive tweets on Wednesday by . broadcaster Piers Morgan, KP’s flag-waver-in-chief, who claimed Prior . told his team-mates at the summit that Flower was ‘behaving like a . headmaster’ and that they were playing in a ‘schoolboy environment’. According to Morgan, Prior added: ‘F*** Flower, this is our team.’ Happier times: Pietersen (left) and Prior celebrate Ashes victory Down Under in 2010 . Morgan . further tweeted, after challenging Prior to take legal action if the . accusations were incorrect: ‘You stabbed Pietersen in the back, yet you . agreed with him re Flower’s dictator style. Makes you a flaming . hypocrite. ‘For the record, @MattPrior13 (Prior) led the England team meeting after Melbourne Test.

I said and the way it was meant.’ Re-integrated: Team-mate Matt Prior posted this picture of Pietersen on Twitter in late 2012 with the caption: '""Re-integration complete. Well played"".' Ironically, . Prior had acted as peacemaker when Pietersen was left out of the . England team in 2012 following a number of issues over his contract. But . the wicketkeeper continued his attack on Morgan by saying: ‘There is no . story here, just an attempt to knock someone who has only ever had the . team’s best interests at heart and tried my best on and off the field to . help the England cricket team. ‘I can hold my head up high in that knowledge!’ Taking a battering: Piers Morgan (right) faces Brett Lee in the nets at the MCG .","Kevin Pietersen told Andy Flower where the team felt he was going wrong .

As the story goes, Presley and his wife-to-be had rented the house as a venue for their ceremony and reception, but gossip columnist Rona Barrett who lived nearby became suspicious when she spotted the couple's relatives arriving in droves at the residence. According to the home's website, the journalist even had a maid working at the house followed to find out when and where the wedding would take place.

"These are the videos that Syrian President Bashar Assad does not want the world to see. The lifeless corpse of four-month-old Afaf Mahmmod Al-Sarakb lies limp and motionless in a chair - tortured to death by government security officers after her parents were arrested. The disfigured body of a tortured taxi driver is seen dumped in the street, while a third video shows blood pouring from the arm of a woman gunned down by a sniper. GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING: Scroll down for video... Tortured to death: Four-month-old Afaf Mahmmod Al-Sarakb was killed by Syrian security forces after her parents were arrested . Anger: What life is really like in Syria is being released in a series of videos, day by day, on YouTube . In just 24 hours anti-government protesters have defied strict censorship laws more than 110 times to publish the series of brutal and shocking videos on YouTube. Hundreds more hours of the brutal scenes have been released in the last two months. They all show a country which has slowly descended into chaos - sparking fears there will be a civil war and floods of refugees fleeing across the border into Israel. It is in stark contrast to the kind of society Assad's regime tries to portray - one where there are small pockets of unrest, but in the majority are happy with his rule. While none of the footage has been independently verified, the content is so compelling and realistic that there is little reason to doubt its veracity. The release of the videos mirrors those leaked during the Libyan conflict, the most gruesome of which showed the capture of ousted leader Colonel Muammar Gaddaafi. They were ultimately proved to be real. Battered: A video of this Syrian showed how his back had been torn to shreds after a series of torture sessions by security forces . Wounded: One of the many videos being released each day showed a woman screaming in pain as blood drips from her arm after she was shot by a sniper . But, while Libyan rebels tentatively dipped their toes into the world of internet publishing, the Syrian conflict is widely regarded as the first YouTube war - where events are played out through its channels on an hourly, if not minute-by-minute, basis. Much of the filming is being released on a daily basis via the Syrian Revolution General Commission, a coalition movement covering most of the country which, according to its Facebook page, is preparing for the overthrow of the regime. In its coverage of yesterday's events the group, based out of the Turkish capital of Istanbul, chronicled attacks, murders, fake rallies of support and crackdowns in the northeastern province of Deir Ezzor, the northwestern city of Idlib, the western city of Hama, and the central city of Homs. The 40-group strong coalition, which is playing an important role in highlighting the truth during the 10-month-old uprising against Assad, also alleged how security forces covered-up 'abuses' as the Arab League monitors visited various areas of the country. To garner favour with observers, the SRGC said 'fabricated marches' in support of the regime took place in Deir Ezzor as they arrived. Protest: There is also several videos containing footage of rallies which, according to President Assad, do not occur very frequently . Dead: Several of the videos show protesters who have allegedly been beaten to death by security forces . Security forces also 'curtained off' various areas of a jail containing political prisoners so monitors did not 'really see' what was going on. The SRGC said it was all to shield observers, in Syria to see where Assad's troops are keeping their word on ending a violent and repressive crackdown, from what was happening. And, elsewhere in the area and in complete contravention of that deal, security forces were seen opening fire on protesters, leading to large numbers of arrests. In the Sahl Al-Ghab region, where electricity is cut off for 15 hours each day, it said security buses and army vehicles routinely roamed the streets raising weapons at residents. In Jaer Al-Shoghour the sound of the security forces' heavy firing is constantly heard, Assad-sponsored gangs ran riot through Darkoush vandalising public property, and in Hama 28-year-old Nabhan Ahmad Al-Mustafa was shot dead while out with friends. The increase in violence, and its release through the SRGC, comes as many believe Assad is losing his grip on power. But despite foreign observers saying his rule could be coming to an end, he re-iterated today how he would not be stepping down. He insisted he still had his people's support and repeated claims that a foreign conspiracy and terrorists were behind the 10-month-old uprising against him - and not true reform-seekers.","Hundreds of videos uploaded to YouTube by protesters each day .

"A woman living on benefits in a housing association block today said she had every right to spend taxpayer money on luxuries such as cigarettes, Sky TV and alcohol. Tracey Macdonald, who has a 16-year-old daughter, said she had been 'brought up' to expect her lifestyle to be bankrolled by the state. She spoke out after her housing association landlord urged tenants to change their lifestyles in order to keep their homes following cuts to benefits. Speaking to ITV's Daybreak she said: 'We get our benefits and we should be able to spend them on what we choose to.' Tracey MacDonald says the suggestion that benefit claiments cut back on extras is outrageous, and that they should be able to do what they want with the money . When Lorraine Kelly asks what Tracey would change if she had to make savings, Tracey said she wouldn't want to cut back on anything . Eastland Homes issued a newsletter advising tenants to cutback on satellite television and cigarettes in preparation for benefit cuts when the bedroom tax is introduced . 'I get £142 a fortnight. I buy my cigarettes, a drink at weekends, shopping, and various things to economise.. I think it's outrageous [to suggest we change spending habits]. ‘I wouldn't want to stop doing anything really, it's the way . I've been brought up - to spend my benefits on what I'm used to, to . survive.’ Asked what she would say to people who have jobs and work long hours but still can’t afford luxuries, Tracey, from Manchester replied: 'Well that's their choice isn't it? Like it's our choice to do what we're doing.' Questioned if she could understand why some people might be angered by her point of view, she smiled and shrugged her shoulders, saying: 'Yeah, but so what? Each to their own isn't it.' Ruth Porter from the Institute of Economic Affairs says we need to talk more about the need to budget . The Eastlands Housing Association advert suggested that residents living in 8,000 former council homes should start budgeting properly if hit by new cuts in housing benefit. The association asked its tenants: ‘Can you really afford Sky, cigarettes, bingo, drinks and other non-essentials?' It added: ‘If your benefit is being cut and you want to keep your home, you have to make up the difference. ‘Non-essential items won’t matter if you lose your home. Start budgeting now – we can help you do this, call us!’ The association was later forced to apologise after it was accused of being ‘deeply patronising’ Many residents, like Tracey, who living in the association’s properties across Manchester were furious at the letter. One of them, Julie Deal, said: ‘It is contemptible. Many of their residents don’t sit around on benefits. 'It is deeply patronising. Talk about stereotyping those who live in former council homes. They should be ashamed.’ Others . took to social media sites to voice their discontent, accusing Eastland . Holmes on Twitter and Facebook of being 'idiots' and saying they should . 'be ashamed.' Sheila . Doran, chief executive of Eastland Homes in Manchester, insisted the . advice in the latest issue of its Streets Ahead newsletter was intended . to help its tenants prepare. Lorraine Kelly asked if Tracey could understand why people who had to work 'all hours of the day' might be angry with those who spent benefits on non essentials . The newsletter received an angry response online among Twitter users who criticised Eastlands Homes . Tenants took to Facebook to vent their fury at the newsletter which was described as 'patronising' ‘We are concerned that some of our customers will be living “hand to mouth” as a result of the benefit cuts,’ she said. ‘Their quality of life will be significantly reduced and they face stark choices. ‘With . benefit levels frozen and escalating fuel bills, there is a risk of . families falling into arrears and losing their homes –  we don’t want to . see that. 'We will provide . as much support as possible and that includes giving advice on . household budgeting, as requested by many of our customers.’ In . a statement Eastlands Homes responded: ‘Our message is that we are here . to help wherever possible and we’re sorry if we worded that clumsily.’ Eastlands homes housing association issued an apology over the newsletter which they admit was worded 'clumsily' Residents of association housing like Dorothy Cooper (right), who has lived in her house for 53 years, and Vicky Ankers, pictured left with her daughter Rubyleigh, reacted with anger to the newsletter . Ruth Porter from the Institute of Economic Affairs, who appeared on Daybreak after Tracey said the budgeting advice from Eastlands Homes was ‘commendable’. She explained: ‘I think the housing . association in this situation was right to apologise probably for the . wording which was slightly careless, but the basic idea that we need to . look more carefully at how we budget, and we need to talk more as a . society about it, I think is actually quite a sensible thing to put out . there. ‘And the fact that . the housing association was saying look, you're about to find that the . amount of money that you've got to survive on is going to be squeezed, . and we're happy to give you budgeting advice, I think was actually a . very commendable thing.’ See the interview in full at www.itv.com/daybreak .

"The UEFA Congress in Vienna next month is seen as the best occasion for a public debate between the four candidates for the FIFA presidency. Prince Ali of Jordan, launching his campaign in London on Tuesday, called for just such a TV occasion, saying he was ‘ready to do it’ and urging president Sepp Blatter to commit along with the other contenders, Michal van Praag and Luis Figo. Ali said: ‘If we are talking about transparency, I would like to see a public debate including the incumbent — so everyone across the world knows what our positions are.’ Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein has challenged FIFA presidential candidates to a live debate . FIFA's Asian vice president insists there needs to be 'more transparency' from the governing body . However, the chances of Blatter, who has most to lose from a live inquest, agreeing to such exposure are slim and FIFA would not comment on the issue. Ali has been nominated by Belarus, Malta, England, Jordan, the United States and Georgia, which means only his home country from his own Asian football confederation are supporting him. He said: ‘I don’t see this as a confederation issue. It’s a worldwide vote.’ Ali blames his lack of backing in Asia on Blatter’s long reign and a ‘culture of intimidation within FIFA in which people who take a principled stand are being punished’. FIFA president Blatter is unlikely to listen to offers of a live TV debate . FIFA candiates (L-R) Michael van Praag, Luis Figo, Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein and Sepp Blatter . With the AFC leadership loyal to Blatter’s cause, Ali faces a fight even to be voted back on to the FIFA executive. But the Sandhurst- educated Prince does not intend to stay on in Zurich if he fails to become president. ‘I cannot see myself in FIFA for the next four years,’ he said. Meanwhile, the FA have nominated Ali but may not vote for him on May 29. They will wait to hear the views of Van Praag and Figo before deciding who is most likely to topple Blatter. A yellow-jacketed Robbie Savage leading BT Sport’s parody of the Sky Sports branding for transfer deadline day was hardly backed up by audience figures for their rival programme.

Robbie Savage's bright yellow suit didn't improve BT Sport's deadline day viewing figures . The women’s FA Cup final is to be staged at Wembley for the first time this season following the great success of the England v Germany international last November in drawing a crowd of 55,000.

Last year’s final attracted a crowd of 15,000 to MK Dons. The astonishing cull at the England and Wales Cricket Board continues with the heads of marketing, commercial and digital told to re-apply for other jobs because they will not be keeping their present ones.

"With his dapper dress sense and lacerating wit, the Duke of Edinburgh looks - and behaves - far younger than his 93 years. But in a rare show of frailty, the 93-year-old royal stepped out in public wearing hearing aids for the very first time today. The listening devices, which could just about be seen protruding from his ears, were worn during a reception for members of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association at Buckingham Palace. Scroll down for video . Sprightly: Despite the hearing aids, the Duke of Edinburgh - and the Queen - were on typically sprightly form . Well hidden: Thin wires could be seen protruding from the Duke's ears - the only sign of hearing aids . Despite the hearing aids, the Duke was on typically sprightly form, enthusiastically welcoming Armed Forces veterans to the palace, alongside the Queen. For her part, the monarch, who is 88 years old, cheerfully chatted to veterans, among them Corporal Mark Donaldson VC of the Australian Special Air Service and Corporal Willie Apiata VC of the New Zealand Special Air Service, as she toured the room. The reception was held on behalf of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association, which brings together living holders of the Victoria and George Crosses, while remembering those who lost their lives. Currently, there are 30 living holders of the two awards, both of which reward exceptional valour on the battlefield or in dangerous circumstances. The Victoria Cross is the oldest and most prestigious of the two and was instituted by Queen Victoria on 29th January 1856 for those who show 'most conspicuous bravery or some daring pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy'. Although the Victoria Cross can only be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth Armed Forces, the George Cross can be awarded to civilians as well. Launched by George VI on the 24th September 1940, it was initially intended to recognise the efforts of Londoners attempting to deal with the Blitz but was soon expanded to apply to members of the Armed Forces who display 'gallant conduct in the face of the enemy'. Along with Corporal Mark Donaldson VC  and Corporal Willie Apiata VC, those to meet the Queen and Prince Philip included Warrant Officer Keith Payne, also a Victoria Cross holder. Warrant Officer Payne, who was awarded the prize in 1969  for leading soldiers of the Australian Training Team to safety following an attack in Vietnam, said the annual event was more important than ever. 'I think events like this have become more and more important with the strife that the world is in now,' he explained. Proud: The Queen was introduced to Corporal Willie Apiata (right) who won his VC in the NZ Special Air Service . Achievement: Corporal Mark Donaldson of the Australian Special Air Force was introduced to the Queen . 'They help to strengthen the bond between allies and recognise the great acts of bravery that happen, not just in the armed forces but by civilians too. 'It gives a bit of a morale boost to know there are still Victoria and George Crosses being handed out.' The annual Buckingham Palace reception has been hosted by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh since the Association began in 1956. Other members of the royal family have also paid tribute to the veterans, among them Prince Charles and Prince Harry. Impressive: Lance Sergeant Johnson Beharry VC and his wife Melissa chat to the Queen at the reception .

But it is the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh who have the longest standing relationship with the Association, which began when they were both new to the British throne.

"Her debut comedy stand-up tour made almost £7 million. And although it has been a monetary success for Miranda Hart it appears not to have been a personal one. For the star yesterday revealed she did not enjoy her 49-show tour, because she gets stressed about performing on stage. Scroll down for video . Miranda Hart, pictured, said she did not enjoy her 49-date sell-out tour of Britain and Australia . Revealing her fears about being in front of large audiences, Miss Hart, 41, said: ‘Stand-up, as a genre, doesn’t really suit my personality. I’m ultimately a bit of an introvert, and I found the pressure of just me in such vast arenas a bit overwhelming.’ Miss Hart’s tour, which took around the country and to Australia, involved dates at London’s O2 and the Manchester Arena, which are two of the UK’s largest indoor venues. According to ticket sales tracker Pollstar, Miss Hart made at least £6.9 million from My What I Call Live Show. The figures have been collated from date for 33 shows, six of which were a sell-out. There were 49 shows in total with Miss Hart performing at various venues across the country including London’s O2 . The popularity of the tour saw Miss Hart add eight new dates due to demand. However appearing on Woman’s Hour yesterday, during a listeners’ interview session, Miss Hart said: ‘I found it very draining, physically, because I’m an introvert, so I don’t feed off the audi-ence, funnily enough. I find it quite stressful, and slightly embarrassing, weirdly. Even the curtain call – I thought, I’m gonna love the curtain call, and I did, because I was thrilled people loved the show. But I was only really doing it for them, not for me. It’s weird. Then it became an act, I was acting being a stand-up.’ Miss Hart received a string of glowing reviews from critics for her performance including the Daily Mail’s Christopher Stevens who noticed her nervs and lack of experience. Ms Hart's father, David Hart Dyke, left, was commander of the HMS Coventry which was sunk during the Falkland's war, Ms Hart, second left, is pictured with her mother Diana and sister Alice, far right . Commenting on her turn at the Bournemouth International Centre earlier this year, he said: ‘The crowd cheered her to the rafters: children with their aunties and grandmas, young couples, parties of pensioners, bunches of teenagers. Miranda’s appeal is as broad as that of showbiz veterans like Bruce Forsyth, which makes it all the more surprising she has never attempted an arena tour with a stand-up show before. ‘Unlike comics who have learned their trade in pubs and clubs, honing their repartee over years, she is a stand-up virgin. ‘Three nights into her British tour, her absence of confidence is obvious. A more experienced performer could have taken this adoring audience and had them convulsed with laughter. As it was, we were merely pleased.’ Miss Hart has since released a DVD of the tour, which is Amazon’s fifth most popular comedy DVD, and 18th bestselling DVD overall. Admitting to enjoying at least parts of the tour, Miss Hart said on Woman’s Hour: ‘I found it a hell of a thing. It was extraordinary, I announced it and decided to do it 18 months before I did it. I didn’t know what I would think of it and I enjoyed being in the room with you lovely people who supported me and the show.’ Earlier this year Miss Hart announced she was quitting her sitcom Miranda so as to ‘end on a high’, after a Christmas finale. The comedienne, whose slapstick routine has made her one of the most popular entertainers, said she didn’t want her character to ‘keep falling over and make a complete fool of herself. Miss Hart was educated at the Duchess of Cambridge’s old public school, Downe House. She is the elder daughter of naval officer David Hart Dyke, 72 — whose destroyer HMS Coventry was sunk in the Falklands War.","Miranda Hart starred in a sell-out 49-night tour across the UK and Australia .

"Arms laden with parcels, the excited guests step into the opulent hotel reception before being whisked to a 'gift room'. As the door swings open they are greeted by a sea of exquisitely wrapped presents and instructed to leave theirs inside. Next they are ushered to a waiting area and served miniature bottles of vintage champagne. Later they will feast at beautifully decorated tables, rounding off the meal with a slice cut from a towering, five-tiered cake. It sounds like the kind of party organised by a wealthy celebrity but hostess Mel Panther, 31, from Beckenham in Kent, is not famous. And although the cash lavished on the occasion would pay for a traditional wedding reception, in fact her guests are celebrating the imminent arrival of a baby. Scroll down for video . Indulgent: Mel, a trainee photographer and now mum to Lonnie, nine months, began planning her baby shower as soon as she found she was pregnant and ran up a bill of £10,000 . Treated like royalty: Mel at her baby shower with her friends . 'Baby showers' — parties thrown before the arrival of a newborn — are increasingly common in Britain, as mums-to-be here adopt a trend from America. Mel, a trainee photographer and now mum to Lonnie, nine months, began planning hers as soon as she found she was pregnant. 'The plan was for it to be grand, girly and very special,' she says. 'I love entertaining, so this gave me an excuse to really push the boat out.' When baby showers first caught on here, they were low-key affairs for a few close girlfriends at their pregnant friend's home. Now the shower has become a costly social event: a recent study found that women in Britain spend £220 million attending baby showers each year. No wonder dozens of companies now offer baby shower gift-lists online, and there are even professional baby shower planners. There was certainly no expense spared at Mel's party, generously funded by her stock trader boyfriend Oliver, 33. 'I'm Disney-obsessed,' says Mel, 'so when I found out I was having a girl I spent hours thinking of ways to incorporate the style of individual Disney princesses into each table.' We’re worth it: Ameeta Phull, pictured with her daughter Sahana, wanted a baby shower that was 'glamorous, fancy and memorable' Generous: Some of the gifts from Ameeta's baby shower including a designer baby changing bag . Mel hired a professional event organiser and together they chose the venue — an 18th-century hotel costing £1,500 — selected the £500 floral arrangements and commissioned a five-tiered Oreo biscuit-flavoured cake, which set Mel back £1,300. Extras, including bespoke invitations, a photo booth where guests could take souvenir pictures, professional photography, and initialled wooden baby block favours for the 50 guests, led to an eye-watering final bill of £10,000. Yet Mel, who was seven months pregnant at the party, insists it was worth it. 'Every single guest was gobsmacked,' she says. 'It was surprise after surprise. It definitely had the wow factor and seeing everyone's reactions made me so proud.' Increasingly, baby showers seem to be taking the place of weddings for unmarried expectant women. Zerena Martells, a 31-year-old HR manager who is not married to her partner Nick, 32, admits that, in the absence of a wedding, it was an excuse for a party. 'So many of my friends got married and had big dos, and I felt I was missing out,' she says. 'I convinced Nick that I deserved a special party but thankfully he has no idea how much I spent.' Growing trend: Baby showers started in America and are becoming increasingly popular in Britain . Zerena toured London's finest afternoon tea venues, including five-star hotels The Dorchester and The Sanderson, before eventually opting for a quirky vintage tearoom in North London. A menu of finger sandwiches, cupcakes and scones, along with table flowers, bespoke bunting and vintage china, set her back just shy of £1,000. Extras pushed the final bill to more than £1,500. 'At the time it didn't feel over-the-top,' says Zerena, now mum to Quinn, five months. 'I kept reminding myself that I deserved it, that my baby girl deserved it. Plus, I wanted to spoil my girlfriends and my family. What better excuse than being pregnant?' Her guests bought gifts from a wish-list she compiled at Mothercare. 'I got everything I asked for, including a Moses basket, a baby walker and a high chair,' Zerena says. In the end she received more than £2,000 worth of gifts . This may sound lavish and materialistic but it is not unusual. A recent study revealed that one woman in eight splurges £100 before attending a baby shower, so an invitation certainly doesn't guarantee a cheap day out. Ameeta Phull, 36, from Northwood, North-West London, copied a celebrity when she began organising her baby shower last year. After reading about the star-studded event that High School Musical actress Vanessa Hudgens arranged for her sister, the accountant resolved to give herself the same VIP treatment when she became pregnant. 'I wanted an event that was glamorous, fancy and memorable,' says the married mum of 18-month-old Sahana. Splashing out: Unmarried Zerena admitted expecting her daughter Quinn was an excuse for a party so she spent thousands on a baby shower and received expensive presents after setting up a gift list . Having saved £10,000, she could afford to think big — and she had a specific theme in mind. 'Gold is my favourite thing,' she says. 'That was the look I wanted for my classy, English-themed party. When I was four months pregnant and visited Buckinghamshire Golf Club and saw its enormous gold-framed pictures, I knew it was the venue for me.' First she hired an event planner. After drawing up a 40-strong all-female guest list, the pair worked together to choose floral arrangements, decide on the menu and order generous party bags containing home-made jam, lollypop-shaped cakes and pink sweets. The event organiser charged £2,500, which included finishing touches such as flowers. ' Champagne afternoon tea at the golf club was £1,500 for 40 of us,' says Ameeta, 'and when you factor in extras like a professional photographer and formal, gold-printed invitations, the whole event cost around £5,000.' Luckily, Ameeta's husband Jaspal, 36, laughed off his wife's excesses when he discovered the cost. 'A few friends commented that I'd gone way over the top,' Ameeta says. 'One actually said the do was ridiculous and that never in a million years would she have spent that much. But no one could deny it was a beautiful event.' It's raining gifts: One woman in eight splurges £100 before attending a baby shower (posed by models) Certainly the baby shower, held when Ameeta was six months pregnant, made her the centre of attention. From the moment she arrived at the 18th-century manor house last February, she was given the red-carpet treatment. After sinking her stilettos into the plush crimson walkway that had been unfurled to meet her at the car door, she had her hair styled and posed for professional photographs. In the vast function room she was greeted by a mountain of perfectly wrapped gifts. She didn't have time to unwrap them before she was enjoying a luxury afternoon tea with lashings of pink lemonade and, after that, party games. Later in the afternoon Ameeta sat down in front of her guests and, one by one over the course of an hour, opened the presents they'd brought. 'It was such a lovely experience and the gifts just kept coming,' she says. 'I got a Burberry changing bag, a high chair, Ralph Lauren baby clothes and even two pairs of tiny Ugg boots. 'My guests had ordered online using a maternity concierge company, and the staff had wrapped the gifts and delivered them to the venue. So it was lovely for everyone to be able to see what they'd bought me. I was given so much — at least £1,000 worth.' With hindsight, does Ameeta feels she might have gone a touch overboard? 'Not at all,' she says resolutely. 'I had an unforgettable, amazing day that people still talk about. Why not spoil yourself? I have absolutely no regrets.'","Parties thrown before arrival of newborn increasingly common in Britain .

"Shrouded in a thick layer of dust and hidden under piles of junk, a complete Victorian kitchen lay forgotten for more than a generation. Archie Graham-Palmer and his wife Philippa discovered the incredible time capsule when they began rummaging in the basement of the family home. They found an entire kitchen kitted out as if the cook had just stepped out for a breath of air. The old cooker in the Victorian kitchen, which has been uncovered after decades of gathering dust . Cooking utensils from the Victorian era remain in place on the walls, shelves and sideboards . House proud: Archie Graham-Palmer and wife Phillippa discovered the relic in the basement of their home . The kitchen's entrance had been blocked since the Second World War with a collection of unwanted belongings . As well as a full cooking range, they discovered kettles, pots, pans, pastry cutters, antique fire extinguishers and jelly moulds. There was a spit for roasting pigs on, as well as a table and benches in the middle of the room which could easily seat 20 staff. The current house at Cefn Lea Park was built around the turn of the 19th century, the previous building on the site having been destroyed by fire in 1794. In the 18th Century it had been the home of the Griffiths family before passing on to the prominent Kenyon family of Gredington. The house was sold in 1830 at an auction held at the Wynnstay Arms Hotel. It was bought by Rev Nathaniel Roberts whose wife, Frances, was daughter of John Matthews, attorney of Chester. However, another fire that same year meant that the house needed extensive renovations. What we see today is likely to date from this period. On Frances' death in 1850, Cefn Park passed to Sir William Henry Roger Palmer, Bt, of Kunure Park, Dublin, who was married to Frances' sister Eleanor. It subsequently went to their son, Sir Roger William Henry Palmer in 1854. The kitchen is thought to date back to the 1830s when the house had a full complement of servants. Unused for more than 100  years, the kitchen was apparently briefly recommissioned during the Second World War because it offered protection from air raids. But it was mothballed after the war and became a dumping ground. Cefn Park near Wrexham, North Wales, has been passed down through the family since it was bought in 1830. Mr Graham-Palmer, 41, who  worked in commercial forestry, moved back to the family home  this year to take over the estate from his  father. With his wife, Philippa, 37, he began investigating the nooks and crannies that had been left undisturbed for decades. ‘The basement had been a dumping ground for years,’ he said. ‘We discovered that the room was as it would have been. ‘We even found a cookbook. Most of the recipes would have needed an army of cooks.’ He and his wife intend to preserve the kitchen because of its links to the estate’s Victorian past and it is being redecorated in colours  from the era. Archie Graham-Palmer and his wife Philippa discovered the below-stairs kitchen in the 200-year-old stately home in Cefn Park . The bells with which the servants were summoned, as well as an unidentified weighted pulley system, remain mounted on the walls . The Cefn Park house is surrounded by 50 acres of land near Wrexham .","The treasure trove of Victorian items included a 19th-century cook book .
Also found were pastry cutters and antique fire extinguishers ."
"The room was dimly lit, but even in the gloom I spotted him immediately, languidly propped up against the bar in his black tie, more handsome than any man has a right to be, surrounded by beautiful girls. They parted like the Red Sea as I walked up to him, my darling gorgeous boyfriend. I’d spent hours getting ready: big hair perfectly tousled, red lipstick slicked on; short gold frock I’d broken the bank to buy. He smiled, took my hand and said: ‘Look at you.’ Pause. ‘Your hair’s all over the place, your mouth is too wide and your nose is too big. But I love you.’ Scroll down for video . Despite having made a lot of effort, Amanda says she was flattered when a boyfriend told her he loved her despite her appearance . Was I hurt, or angry? No. I was flattered. And much as I’m ashamed to say it, I was grateful too. After all, it seemed scarcely believable that someone as fabulous as him could love someone as insignificant as me. We didn’t have a name for his behaviour back in the Eighties, but today we do. It’s called ‘negging’ — an extraordinary seduction ‘technique’ based on criticism, hurtfulness and downright rudeness. According to the Urban Dictionary, an online dictionary of common slang, ‘Negs’ are ‘low-grade insults meant to undermine the self-confidence of a woman so she might be more vulnerable to advances’. ‘Negging’ has become big business. Seminars, blogs and online forums all purport to teach men how to ‘neg’ women into bed, working on the extraordinary premise that insulting and knocking her down will make her more malleable and willing. And that then throwing her a kind word or a scrap of love, like chucking a bone to a starving dog, is the most psychologically effective means of making a woman want a man. According to the Urban Dictionary, an online dictionary of common slang, ‘Negs’ are ‘low-grade insults meant to undermine the self-confidence of a woman so she might be more vulnerable to advances’ (stock picture) It is, I suppose, the modern version of the horrible maxim ‘treat them mean, keep them keen’. And I am ashamed to say it worked for that long-ago boyfriend — and, to my utter horror, looks like it will continue to work for the next generation, too. My boyfriend was an artful and instinctive negger long before it became what it is now — an international movement and supposed ‘artform’, practised by self-styled ‘pick-up artists’ (PUAs) who learn at the feet of so-called gurus such as Julien Blanc. Barred from these shores earlier this month by Home Secretary Theresa May after an online petition was signed by 150,000 people, Swiss-born Blanc is the deeply misogynistic U.S.-based negger who exists at the extreme end of the PUA movement and charges men $3,000 (£2,000) to learn the dark arts of female manipulation at boot camps. Julien Blanc is the first person to be banned from Britain for sexist behaviour . The general technique, seduction as subjugation, has gained a frighteningly large following, and demands that we ask why many modern men regard it with such disgusting glee. Blanc himself admits of his teachings: ‘It’s offensive. It’s inappropriate. It’s emotionally scarring. But it’s damn effective.’ When I first heard about ‘negging’ in the wake of the furore surrounding Blanc, I talked to my girlfriends, and many shamefacedly confessed to having been on the receiving end of such behaviour, as young women and into middle age. One said she was recently approached by a nice-looking, slightly podgy man in the local pub, who piped up: ‘You’re brave wearing skinny jeans.’ Then: ‘I’m really turned on by big women.’ She’s a size 14. She replied: ‘Sadly for you, I’m not turned on by middle-aged idiots.’ Amanda says she was recently approached by a man who told her he loved big women . At least as older women, if insults still get chucked at us, we are more likely to be equipped to hit back. But it’s different for younger women, who seem much more susceptible to the PUA’s contemptuous subliminal message. And that message is one that ultimately aims to shatter self-confidence. After all, say psychologists, a woman who feels ‘imperfect’ almost always demands less from a partner. Low self-esteem leads to a craving for approval. It may all be a tawdry and disgusting game to the ‘neggers’, but such behaviour has its roots in credible psychology. How often have I listened to my friends’ daughters agonising over the casual if not callous way a boy is treating her. The agony of waiting for a text, the disappearance after sex, the insecurity, the way young men build them up just to knock them down. But that’s the ‘neg’ technique. Young people are quite cruel in the dating game. They commit and marry a decade later than we did, so have a lot of time to play the field and to wreak havoc in it. In today’s dating landscape, the horrid practice of rating the opposite sex on a one-to-ten scale seems ‘normal’ and widespread. The basic principle here is that you can’t date a person who is three points higher than you — which is where ‘negging’ comes in. The six boy gets a ten girl in his sights and the only way to have sex with her is to make her feel like a three. By devaluing her she becomes within his reach. In the process he makes a clever young woman feel like a loser — and a bewilderingly large number of today’s girls seem to embrace that feeling with something akin to martyrdom. Why do they have such low self-esteem? Part of the problem lies within the existence of Facebook and Twitter. The virtual world is doing half the neggers’ work for them. Every thought, action and encounter, is accompanied by a constant and often cruel online commentary that they’re not good enough, clever enough or slim enough. And as a result, in some strange way, they’ve become addicted to being put down. There were certainly neggers on the scene when I was a girl, but we weren’t such easy prey. Where young people today are in contact at all hours of the day and night, we spoke to boys on the landline telephone — how quaint! — for no more than a few minutes at a time. We made our own clothes. Now girls have to look cool, wear the right designers, be gorgeous, be funny, and conform to a rigid set of suffocating ‘norms’. And it erodes their self-confidence. Just as it does dating a boy who’s obsessed with internet porn, for example, and who expects female bodies to look like the ones on the screen. Or to be immersed in a teen culture where pop stars promote sexual availability, skinniness, and an unattainable fantasy of what a young woman is really like or should be. ‘Pick-up artist’ Julien Blanc, right, with Russell Brand. He was banned from entering the country . And the PUAs, the despicable Blancs of this world, exploit that vulnerability. The PUA culture really kicked off more than a decade ago with the bestselling book The Game, by Neil Strauss. It claimed to penetrate the secret society of pick-up artists, offering techniques and strategies with one sole purpose — having sex with women, then ditching them. It doesn’t take too much surfing of Julien Blanc’s ‘manosphere’ — the informal network of blogs and websites set up by men in opposition to feminism — to realise that it is populated by a bunch of nerdy losers. Home Secretary Theresa May banned Blanc after an online petition was signed by 150,000 people . Hopeless, hapless men who feel lost in a world of accomplished young women. They feel emasculated, like spare parts, and the only way of hitting on women is to knock them down to their own size. Indeed, I’d heartily recommend that every young woman reads one of these obnoxious sites to see exactly what they’re up to. Try seductionscience.com, perhaps, which claims to offer ‘advice’ to loser men. Some of it is too vulgar to be repeated in a family newspaper, but its ethos is summed up by Jesse Charger, the ‘seduction guru’ who runs the site. ‘This should be a mantra in your head every time you see a woman that stirs your loins . . . “She just wants to be bent over and have her hair pulled!” ’ Any woman who’s visited the site should be able spot the signs she is being ‘negged’ — before running a mile.","Amanda was flattered when a boyfriend told her he disliked her appearance .

"In just two years as the head of Thomas Cook, Harriet Green has seen the company add £2billion to its value - but has now departed . She has been credited with transforming the fortunes of the UK’s oldest tour operator, Thomas Cook. But yesterday, Harriet Green – one of the country’s leading and most outspoken businesswomen - left the firm with immediate effect after just two years in the job. The sudden departure of the colourful 52-year-old stunned the City, wiping £360 million off the company’s value as its share price plunged. One insider indicated that the board had grown frustrated with the ‘personality cult’ which Miss Green had cultivated. The outspoken businesswoman made comments to the media on everything from maternity leave - 'a year is too long' - to overweight staff. Under her stewardship she revived a firm which was on the brink, adding almost £2billion its value. Well-known in the City for her voracious work ethic, gruelling 5am fitness regimes and for needing less sleep than Margaret Thatcher, the glamorous high flyer has been replaced by Peter Fankhauser, a 13 year Swiss veteran of the firm. Mystery surrounds why the board was in such a hurry to get rid of its star chief executive, who is thought to have wanted another 12 months at the helm to knock the business into shape. In a statement issued to the stockmarket Ms Green – who has not lined up another job - indicated the timing of her departure was of her own choosing and said her ‘work is complete’. She said: ‘I have always said that I would move on to another company with fresh challenges once my work was complete. That time is now.’ But speaking at trade publication Management Today’s Inspiring Women conference last Thursday, Ms Green told a very different story. She said the turnaround at Thomas Cook was far from complete and described it as a six year job. ‘There are many things that aren’t done,’ she said. ‘You can’t do a transformation on this sort of scale in a year or two years. I usually say it’s about six years….. We go to the city next week with our second set of results, to show if and how the company has become fitter and better, and we’re absolutely not done.’ Although the chairman insisted the decision was ‘amicable’ and ‘unanimous’, it appears to have backfired as shares fell by almost 18pc yesterday. It is thought that the board may have become frustrated with the 'cult of personality' that outspoken Ms Green has cultivated during her time at the company . This was also driven by a warning from the company that ‘tougher market conditions’ – particularly growing problems in the eurozone – would cause its business to grow more slowly next year. Chairman Frank Meysman rejected reports that Ms Green had been pushed out. Ms Green, who was paid £2.86million last year, will receive a pay-off of six months’ salary, worth £340,000, as well as share awards and long term bonuses built up during her time in charge. Mr Meysman said she was leaving ahead of the three years she had initially targeted because she had done such an ‘excellent job’ in turning the company around. Miss Green has become a darling of the City and a role model for women in business after leading a dramatic revival of Thomas Cook, which is used by 6.5million British holidaymakers a year and traces its history back to 1841. Her success has also gained the attention of the Prime Minister, with David Cameron appointing her to his inner circle of top business advisers. As one of the few female bosses of big companies, Ms Green was voted Veuve Clicquot businesswoman of the year in May. Her departure means there are just twelve women running FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 firms. Standing just 5 foot 3 tall, Ms Green has shown a ruthless streak, cutting costs and adapting the business to cater for the surge in people booking their holidays online, rather than by visiting a travel agent. Thomas Cook still specialises in all inclusive package holidays, but Ms Green has sought to take the business upmarket. The strategy has been painful, with the firm cutting 2,500 jobs and closing more than 300 high street stores in a bid to cut costs and modernise. But it has also been successful. The share price has soared from 14p when Ms Green took the helm in July 2012 to 139.9p – with a market value of just over £2billion on Tuesday night, before yesterday’s announcement. Miss Green, the former boss of electronics components distributor Premier Farnell, is not lacking in confidence. Ms Green is pictured with her husband Graham Clarkson at an awards ceremony earlier this year . For more from the National Business Awards click here. Despite having no experience in the travel industry she famously cold called the chairman of the struggling tour operator Frank Meysman, telling him she was the right person to turn the business around. At the time it was on its knees, suffering from a general fall in tourism numbers as a result of the global recession and unrest in the Middle East hitting package holidays in Egypt and Tunisia. Miss Green is equally focussed about her love life– she claims to have taken just seven seconds to choose her businessman husband Graham when she met him in New York. She has two step children from her husband’s first marriage, but says she does not see her family from Monday to Thursday. Instead she is said to spend most of her working week in the five star Brown’s Hotel in London’s Mayfair, before heading to the family home in Oxford at the weekends. A self professed lover of designer labels and diamonds, Ms Green is also a fitness fanatic and enjoys early 5.30am gym sessions with her former marine and war veteran personal trainer. She is a devotee of Hatha Yoga and claims to need just four hours sleep a night, declaring the death of her father when she was just 14 persuaded her to make the most of every day. 'Sleep is overrated': The life of Harriet Green . Harriet Green has previously boasted of getting just three and a half hours of sleep a night, and hits the gym for an hour a day with an ex-Marine . At the end of 2011, Thomas Cook was a company at its lowest ebb. Falling tourism numbers had seen nearly three quarters of the firm's value disappear in just 12 months, while it had just been named as Britain's Least Admired Company. In November the board had to go to banks, begging bowl in hand, to ask for £200million to prop itself up. It was around that time that chairman Frank Meysman got a cold-call from Harriet Green. Never one to doubt her own abilities, Ms Green told him simply that she was the person to turn Thomas Cook's ailing fortunes around. The following summer, she was appointed as CEO. That direct, no-nonsense pitch was typical of Ms Green's style. Under her leadership, the firm has cut 2,500 staff, closed 300 stores, but managed to add £2billion to its value. Despite standing at just 5ft 3in tall, Ms Green has managed to carve out a career in the boisterous, testosterone-driven world of the modern global CEO. She once quipped that 'sleep is overrated' and reportedly gets just three and a half hours of shut-eye each night, less than former Prime Minister Margret Thatcher. Her daily routine sees her up at 3.3am each morning to answer emails from staff of all ranks as part of her Ask Harriet hour. She told Management Today: 'I reply to every email within 24 hours and usually a lot faster. 'When people realised that, it sent the most symbolic ripple through the organisation. ""She replies to us, and quickly, so we've got to keep moving!"" By 5am she is usually in the gym, pushing herself through a gruelling routine alongside her personal trainer - a former Marine who served in Afghanistan. Business may keep her occupied for the remainder of the day, but she still finds time to be a prolific tweeter and an avid reader, picking up everything from Sigmund Freud to Donna Tartt. Born in 1961 in Shipton, Gloucestershire, Ms Green is the eldest of three children and attended state school Westwood's Grammar. She was a fan of amateur dramatics and history at school, but the defining moment of her younger years came when her father died of a brain tumour when she was just 14. She says the trauma taught her that 's*** happens' and was determined to make the most of every moment from then on. She went on to King's College, London, where she graduated with a BA in Medieval Literature in 1983, and studied at the London School of Economics. She began her career working for a magazine, Working Women, before making the move into business herself. Since then Ms Green has lived and worked on four continents and even learnt Mandarin for one job, giving a speech to 2,000 people in Shanghai using her new language. While there she also began practicing yoga, and at one time had a miniature Zen Buddhist garden arranged on her desk. But a touchy-feely new-ager she is not. Outspoken in her opinions, she has branded a year of maternity leave as 'too long' and rubbished the idea of quotas to attract more women to the boardroom. It is perhaps that attitude that saw her depart from Thomas Cook yesterday, a year ahead of schedule. But it is an attitude she is unlikely to change any time soon.","Harriet Green has left Thomas Cook as CEO calling the decision 'mutual'

"It’s the smile of an ecstatic young woman whose fortunes have dramatically turned from facing decades in an Italian prison to enjoying the prospect of a bumper $4million payday. Amanda Knox, 24, of Seattle, Washington, spent four years in jail in Perugia for allegedly murdering British student Meredith Kercher, 21, before she was sensationally released on appeal last October. Now she has been pictured out with her guitarist boyfriend James Terrano, also 24, going for lunch to celebrate signing a $4million book deal with HarperCollins on Thursday to tell her dramatic story.

Knox now needs to consider how she will spend her new fortune, and was also seen earlier in the day with her room-mate Madison Paxton, 24, taking a box of belongings to a Seattle Salvation Army store. She was seen shopping at a Salvation Army store in her hometown for Christmas presents last year, before the extraordinary battle this month between 20 publishers for her signature had got going. Knox has not publicly discussed her ordeal beyond a brief expression of gratitude upon her release last October. But her untitled book has been tentatively scheduled for release in early 2013. ‘Knox will give a full and unflinching account of the events that led to her arrest in Perugia and her struggles with the complexities of the Italian judicial system,’ a HarperCollins spokesman said. ‘Aided by journals she kept during her imprisonment, Knox will talk about her harrowing experience at the hands of the Italian police and later prison guards and inmates,’ he added. Donations: Knox now needs to consider how she will spend her new fortune, and was seen earlier on Thursday with her room-mate Madison Paxton, 24, taking a box of belongings to Seattle Salvation Army store . ‘She will reveal never before-told details surrounding her case, and describe how she used her inner strength and strong family ties to cope with the most challenging time of her young life.’ 'It will be the story of a crime and a trial, but also a moving account of a young woman's struggle to cope with a nightmarish ordeal that placed her at the centre of a media storm' Jonathan Burnham, HarperCollins . Knox was represented by lawyer Robert Barnett, whose other clients include President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush.  She met with seven of the 20 interested publishers, all of whom submitted bids. HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham said the book will give Knox a chance to explain what happened through her eyes and ‘an opportunity to tell the story in full detail, for the first time’. ‘It will be the story of a crime and a trial, but also a moving account of a young woman's struggle to cope with a nightmarish ordeal that placed her at the centre of a media storm,’ Mr Burnham said. Mr Burnham said that Knox, who studied creative writing, would work with a collaborator and that her book will cover her life in Perugia leading up to the murder of Miss Kercher. Couple: Amanda Knox, pictured with boyfriend James Terrano, has not publicly discussed her ordeal beyond a brief expression of gratitude upon her release last October . Knox's editor will be Claire Wachtel, whose other authors have included crime novelist Dennis Lehane, journalist Cokie Roberts and U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. 'Claire Wachtel has a great track record of working with high-profile figures. She's a very sensitive, responsive editor who I think can work with someone like Amanda' Jonathan Burnham, HarperCollins . ‘Claire has a great track record of . working with high-profile figures,’ Mr Burnham said. ‘She's a very sensitive, . responsive editor who I think can work with someone like Amanda, who's . new to the experience.’ But it’s not easy to sell books about controversial defendants. O.J. Simpson's ‘If I Did It’ - a fictionalised account of Nicole Brown Simpson's murder - was cancelled by HarperCollins in 2006. Publishers have also shied away from Florida mother Casey Anthony, cleared of murdering her daughter last year. But Mr Burnham said he was deeply impressed by Knox when he met with her. ‘This is a very mature, intelligent woman who has been through an extraordinary experience,’ Mr Burnham said. ‘She'll write a very thoughtful, reflective and serious book about what happened.' Hugs: Earlier this week, Italian prosecutors asked the country's highest criminal court to reinstate the murder convictions of Amanda Knox, pictured with James Terrano . Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman, the Italian appeals court judge who freed Knox, broadly criticised the investigation and conviction of Knox in a 143-page document released last December. 'This is a very mature, intelligent woman who has been through an extraordinary experience. She'll write a very thoughtful, reflective and serious book about what happened' Jonathan Burnham, HarperCollins . Judge Hellman wrote that she had been pressed to make statements against her own interest and strongly questioned the reliability of a pair of key witnesses. But Knox's legal issues are not over. Earlier this week, Italian prosecutors asked the country's highest criminal court to reinstate the murder convictions of Knox and her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. Sollecito, who had reportedly been considering seeing Knox at Christmas, has since been pictured kissing and cuddling Annie Achille - an Italian volleyball player who is also his distant cousin. Prosecutor Giovanni Galati said he is ‘very convinced’ that Sollecito and Knox were responsible for the November, 2007, stabbing death of Miss Kercher, who shared an apartment with her in Perugia. Altogether now: James Terrano, Amanda Knox and Madison Paxton were pictured in Seattle on Thursday . The appeals court in October said the guilty verdicts against the pair were not corroborated by any evidence, and that the court hadn't proven they were in the house when Miss Kercher was killed. 'Aided by journals she kept during her imprisonment, Knox will talk about her harrowing experience at the hands of the Italian police and later prison guards and inmates' HarperCollins spokesman . A third defendant, Ivory Coast-born Rudy Guede, was convicted in another trial of sexually assaulting and stabbing Miss Kercher. His 16-year sentence was upheld by Italy's highest court in 2010. Meanwhile, a lawyer for Knox recently filed an appeal of her upheld slander conviction in Italy, for falsely accusing bar owner Diya ‘Patrick’ Lumumba of involvement in the slaying. Lumumba was freed after two weeks in prison for lack of evidence. But Knox later said she was ‘manipulated’ during her lengthy police interrogation. An Italian judge set Knox's sentence for . slander at three years, less than the time she spent in prison. That . meant she could leave Italy and return to Seattle, which she did to . great public debate.

Knox's parents, Edda Mellas and Curt Knox, who divorced when she was aged two, have put on a united front and took out second mortgages. But the deal will distress Miss Kercher’s family.

"Even though we are just a few days into fall, the traditional colours of autumn are already visible from space. Nasa today revealed these stunning images from its Terra satellite capturing fall colors around the Great Lakes and New England. The brown and orange shades are most pronounced in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, northern Wisconsin, upstate New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and southern Quebec and Ontario. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA?s Terra satellite captured this view of fall colors around the Great Lakes on Sept. 26, 2014. The changing of leaf color in temperate forests involves several causes and reactions, but the dominant factors are sunlight and heat. As explained by the U.S. Forest Service, certain species of trees produce certain colors. Oaks generally turn red, brown, or russet; hickories become golden bronze; aspen and yellow-poplar turn golden. Maples differ by species. Red maple turns brilliant scarlet; sugar maple, orange-red; and black maple, yellow. Leaves of some trees, such as elms, simply become brown. The changing of leaf color in temperate forests involves several causes and reactions, but the dominant factors are sunlight and heat. Since temperatures tend to drop sooner and sunlight fades faster at higher latitudes, the progression of fall color changes tends to move from north to south across North America from mid-September through mid-November. In late summer and autumn, tree and plant leaves produce less chlorophyll, the green pigment that harvests sunlight for plants to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars. The subsidence of chlorophyll allows other chemical compounds in the leaves—particularly carotenoids and flavonoids—to emerge from the green shadow of summer. The brown and orange shades are most pronounced in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, northern Wisconsin, upstate New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and southern Quebec and Ontario. You can also see faint traces of phytoplankton blooms in the lakes and offshore in the North Atlantic. NASA launched the Earth Observing System's flagship satellite 'Terra,' named for Earth, on December 18, 1999. Terra has been collecting data about Earth's changing climate. Terra carries five state-of-the-art sensors that have been studying the interactions among the Earth's atmosphere, lands, oceans, and radiant energy. Each sensor has unique design features that will enable scientists to meet a wide range of science objectives. These compounds do not decay as fast as chlorophyll, so they shine through in yellows, oranges, and reds as the green fades. Another set of chemicals, anthocyanins, are associated with the storage of sugars and give the leaves of some species deep purple and red hues. As explained by the U.S. Forest Service, certain species of trees produce certain colors. Oaks generally turn red, brown, or russet; hickories become golden bronze; aspen and yellow-poplar turn golden. Maples differ by species. Red maple turns brilliant scarlet; sugar maple, orange-red; and black maple, yellow. Leaves of some trees, such as elms, simply become brown. Weather affects the range and intensity of colors. If the weather stays above freezing, it is easier for anthocyanins to form. Dry weather, which increases the sugar concentration in sap, also increases the amount of anthocyanin. So the brightest autumn colors occur when dry, sunny days are followed by cool, dry nights. According to a paper published last month by researchers from Princeton University, climate change could someday delay the onset of fall color changes in some species, but also extend it later into the year. Warmer temperatures could lengthen the growing season for some plants, though moreso at middle latitudes than high latitudes.","Nasa's Terra satellite captured fall colors around the Great Lakes and New England .

"Labour’s refusal to say Germany started the First World War makes them unfit for office, Boris Johnson said today. The London Mayor condemned the party’s education spokesman Tristram Hunt for claiming it was ‘crass’ and ‘ugly’ to pin the blame for the Great War on Germany. It marks an escalation in the political row over how Britain should mark this year’s centenary of the outbreak of the conflict in 1914. London Mayor Boris Johnson (left) accused Labour's Tristram Hunt (right) of 'talking total twaddle' by playing down the part played by Germany in the outbreak of the First World War . Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove last week attacked the left-wing academics for fuelling myths about the First World War, accusing shows like Blackadder of belittling Britain and clearing Germany of blame. Mr Hunt yesterday accused Mr Gove of trying to use the WWI centenary to ‘sow political division’, condemning ‘ugly’ and ‘crass’ attacks by the Conservatives. He wrote in The Observer: ‘Whether you agree or disagree, given the deaths of 15 million people during the war, attempting to position 1918 as a simplistic, nationalistic triumph seems equally foolhardy, not least because the very same tensions re-emerged to such deadly effect in 1939.’ Mr Hunt, an historian who was elected to . the Commons in 2010, said that the case put forward by Mr Gove, Max . Hastings and Fritz Fischer that the conflict ‘was a necessary act of . resistance against a militaristic Germany bent on warmongering and . imperial aggression’ overlooked internal opposition to Kaiser Wilheim . II. Education Secretary Michael Gove said shows like Blackadder and Oh What A Lovely War painted an incorrect picture of the conflict . But Mr Johnson hit back today, accusing Mr Hunt of ‘talking total twaddle’, adding: ‘If Tristram Hunt seriously denies that German militarism was at the root of the First World War, then he is not fit to do his job, either in opposition or in government, and should resign. If he does not deny that fact, he should issue a clarification now.’ Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Johnson added: ‘It is a sad but undeniable fact that the First World War – in all its murderous horror – was overwhelmingly the result of German expansionism and aggression. ‘That fact is, alas, not one that the modern Labour Party believes it is polite to mention.’ Downing Street appeared to back Mr Johnson today, insisting Britain 'should not be afraid' to make clear why it needed to stand up to German aggression. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ‘The prime minister’s view is that the centenary of the First World War is an opportunity to do three things, one obviously to commemorate the fallen, second, there’s an opportunity of course to learn about the impact the conflict had on our country and the world because of course there were very significant impacts on us as a society and as an economy as a result. ‘And thirdly of course to reflect on the achievement of peace for the most part, with some tragic exceptions obviously such as the Balkans conflict in the 1990s, but for the most part on peace in Europe following the two conflicts which scarred the first half. ‘So there’s an opportunity for us to do that, and I think we can do that without being afraid of saying it was right for Britain to respond to aggression and to enter the war on that basis. 'So those are the things we can do, and we can do those without being afraid that it was right for Britain to respond in the way that it did.’ Captain Coward: Tony Robinson as Private Baldrick, left, and Rowan Atkinson as Blackadder in the titular sit-com, which Education Secretary Michael Gove blames for distorting attitudes about the First World War . The political battle over how the Great World War should be remembered has focussed in particular on whether the BBC sitcom Blackadder should be shown in schools. Mr Gove argued: ‘The conflict has, for many, been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as Oh! What a Lovely War, The Monocled Mutineer and Blackadder, as a misbegotten shambles – a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite. Even to this day there are Left-wing academics all too happy to feed those myths.’ Blackadder star Sir Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick in the series, branded Mr Gove ‘very silly’. Sir Tony, a prominent member of the Labour Party who once sat on its national executive, said: ‘I think Mr Gove has just made a very silly mistake. It is not that Blackadder teaches children about World War One. ‘When imaginative teachers bring it in, it’s simply another teaching tool,’ he told Sky News. ‘They probably take them over to Flanders to have a look at the sights out there, have them marching around the playground, read the poems of Wilfred Owen to them. And one of the things that they’ll do is show them Blackadder.’","London Mayor accuses Tristram Hunt of 'talking total twaddle' about WWI .

"Nobody is more excited than I am to learn that wavy hair is back in vogue. As someone who has been battling frizz and wayward natural curl for more than a decade, I have long waited for this moment. In fashion circles, they’ve dubbed the must-have look ‘the mermaid wave’, by which we’re talking tousled, natural-looking, wavy locks. Scroll down for video . New wave: Charlotte Kemp tries the Lee Stafford Chopstick Styler on her own hair . Or you could call it the low maintenance bounce, as long as you find the right products to keep waves smooth and fuzz free (I’d highly recommend Windle and Moodie’s new Fortifying Spray which smoothes, and adds bounce and shine). But the long and short of it is that it’s time to pack away those straightening tongs. What we need is a gadget to perfect, not iron out, our curls which is why even ghd, the king of straighteners, has a new curling range. ‘The key to perfecting this look is not to make waves or curls look too uniform,’ says Jordan Garrett, senior stylist at Hershesons. ‘You don’t want an Eighties-style perm. You want playful, feminine movement.’ But how easy is it to achieve this new look at home? I’ve road-tested eight curling tongs and wands to find out which is the best — and Jordan also gives his verdict. Mark Hill Bad Girl Glam Wicked Waver . £59.99, markhill.co.uk . CHARLOTTE SAYS: This has a heated, corkscrew barrel you wind hair around. After waiting for it to heat up, you wrap a section of hair in the grooves, hold for a few seconds and then release. You get a loose curl with good staying power but you need to straighten hair first with a brush for a smooth finish. Has variable heat settings from 120c to 200c. JORDAN SAYS: I am not a massive fan of the spiral barrel — if you don’t get the hair in the grooves, you get a kink in the wave. But it’s easy to use and quick. Start from the cheek bone for a softer, natural wave that frames the face. That way you avoid the dropped perm look. ghd Curve Creative Curl Wand . £110, ghdhair.com . CHARLOTTE SAYS: The wand is tapered — it’s round at the top narrowing to an oval tip — to achieve loose waves. Works best if you tackle the hair in very small sections, but that means it’s time consuming. Twist a small section of hair at the root then wind round the barrel, hold for a few seconds and release. Comes in a stylish clutch with a heat-resistant mat to rest the wand on, but there’s only one heat setting. JORDAN SAYS: I like wands because they’re easy to use at home. Don’t look in the mirror or you will get in a tangle. Just split the hair roughly into sections and wind it round. Practise with the heat off, and keep the wand horizontal to avoid prom hair. Lee Stafford Chopstick Styler . £19.49, leestaffordelectricals.com . CHARLOTTE SAYS: This heats up quickly (just one temperature) and it’s very easy to use. You just wind sections of hair around the tong, hold for a few seconds and release. But if the sections are too small, you get really tight corkscrew curls—a great look for the young but ageing and dated if you’re the wrong side of 40. One for a teen daughter or niece? JORDAN SAYS: The smaller the tong, the tighter the wave. The key here is how you section the hair. If you divide it into big sections, this styler is excellent for perfecting a fashionable Twenties Hollywood wave. If the sections are too small, you’ll end up with an Eighties corkscrew perm curl. My only gripe is the barrel is rectangular rather than cylindrical which means curls have a slight dent. Instyler Wet 2 Dry Rotating Iron . £69.99, argos.co.uk . CHARLOTTE SAYS:  This is designed to dry, smooth and curl the hair. There’s a brush on one side and a heated rotating barrel on the other, so you put sections of wet hair between the two, close it and pull hair through from roots to ends. It’s quite noisy because the barrel is motorised. It takes a long time to dry long hair, too. I got a flick at the front, but it was hard to achieve a tight curl and impossible to reach the back of my hair. Best for shorter hair. Has three temperature settings. JORDAN SAYS:This is like a hairdryer meets tong — and it would be difficult to use on yourself. I think it’s better at straightening than curling, and to dry a head of hair would take ages. Glamoriser Professional Digital Auto Curler by Richard Ward . £74.99, richardward.com . CHARLOTTE SAYS: This curls hair around a heated barrel using a rotating motor. You just put a section of hair in the clamp, starting from the ends, and press rotate. The barrel then spins and the hair winds up. Once the tong is near the roots, there’s a button to rotate the barrel the other way so you can release the curl, but it’s hard to find so I got in a tangle a few times. My conclusion — best to get a friend to help. Comes in a heat-resistant bag with heat-resistant glove. You can vary the temperature from 80c to 210c. JORDAN SAYS: I think the rotating technology is tricky to use if you are trying to curl hair by yourself. You can’t see the control buttons easily, so I’d suggest using it like a wand instead. Wind hair round the barrel by hand and then it works really well as it’s a good weight, and the barrel is big, so it makes lovely waves and curls. Hershesons Professional Tourmaline Waving Tong . £98, hershesons.com . CHARLOTTE SAYS: This is light to hold, though I found it tricky to master at first. Using the long clamp, which you open and shut with a lever, you can smooth hair before curling it up which is great for banishing frizz. To do this, you put a section of hair in the clamp starting near the root and pull it down along the heated barrel. Then you wind the hair around the barrel to get a curl. It heats up quickly, too, with variable temperature settings from 130c to 230c. The curls and waves had real lasting power and were shiny and smooth. Comes with a heat resistant mat in a stylish drawstring bag. JORDAN SAYS: ‘This has a long cable so you can work round the head easily. It’s suitable for any hair length too — the clamp will give you better control when you are working with shorter hair. Use a lower temperature for coarse or fine hair. Thicker hair will need a higher setting for the wave not to fall out. Babyliss Curl Secret . £120, babyliss.co.uk . CHARLOTTE SAYS: When you close this space age looking clamp on a section of hair, it gets sucked into a heated roller chamber and held there. You then wait for the timer to bleep so you can release the hair — and there should be a curl. But it didn’t work very well on long hair, only achieving a wave at the ends. The hair didn’t always get sucked into the chamber either. A bit gimmicky. Comes with a heat protection mat and has two heat settings and three time settings. JORDAN SAYS: This does the job but it’s quite hard work to line up each section of hair with the gadget so it can be sucked into the ‘curl chamber’ correctly. Best for shorter hair, I’d say. Diva Big Waves . £89.99, divapro.co.uk . CHARLOTTE SAYS:  Very easy to use — it’s like a crimper, only the grooves are much wider so you end up with a Veronica Lake wave. Take a section of hair and clamp the waver close to the roots, hold a few seconds and release then continue moving down the hair section linking the waves. Don’t leave your hair in for too long to avoid damage. It’s not just a one trick pony — if you clamp the waver shut at the ends of a section of hair, you can wind hair around the outside to get a big barrel curl. JORDAN SAYS: This is excellent for achieving a slick, uniform wave if your hair is one length. Take long sections and crimp, starting near the root. Work your way down keeping the grooves lined up.","Charlotte Kemp is thrilled wavy hair is back in vogue .

"Around 1.5million Mastercard and Visa accounts have been hacked in a major credit card heist. The data leak was revealed on . Friday, when both companies confirmed that a major theft of U.S. consumers' credit . card data was being investigated. It was first thought that as many as 10million customers' information had been stolen. Investigation: Mastercard and Visa are said to have notified all of their customers of the security breach . The companies, which are the two largest . global credit card processors, said the issue stemmed from a third-party . vendor, Global Payments, and not their own internal systems. 'Less than 1,500,000 card numbers may have been exported,' by hackers who had access to the firm's payment processing system, Global Payments said in a statement. 'Cardholder names, addresses and social security numbers were not obtained by the criminals.' However, even without this . information, the company admitted that the data taken from each account . would be enough to make fraudulent transactions. It also said hacker access was limited to North America. Following the news, trading in the company's shares was halted after they dropping more than 9.1 per cent. Global Payments said it had 'identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a portion of its processing system' and had determined in early March that the intruders might have gained access to credit-card data. Customers have been urged to check . their accounts online or contact their financial institution regarding . any concerns they have. Brian Krebs, left, reported that Mastercard and Visa were contacting their customers about the breach and Avivah .

'MasterCard is concerned whenever there is any possibility that . cardholders could be inconvenienced and we continue to both monitor this . event and take steps to safeguard account information.' Visa also released a statement saying their customers were victims of data theft, but said its own systems were not hacked. The company has provided the issuing . banks with the affected account numbers and assured customers they would . not be responsible for fraudulent purchases. The companies' statements came after the blog Krebs on Security reported that MasterCard and Visa have been alerting banks across the U.S. about a 'massive' breach that may affect more than ten million cardholders. Brian Krebs told Technology Live: 'Law enforcement asked everyone to keep . it quiet so as not to disturb investigations.' Theft: MasterCard confirmed they are currently investigating a potential account data compromise event of a U.S.-based entity . The breach likely occurred at a central . aggregation point where card information is calculated, said Avivah . Litan, security analyst at Gartner Research. She believes the data is already being used on the street by identity thieves. She wrote on her blog: 'I’ve spoken with folks in the card business who are seeing signs of this breach mushroom. Looks like the hackers have started using the stolen card data more recently. 'From what I hear, the breach involves a taxi and parking garage company in the New York City area, so if you’ve paid a NYC cab in the last few months with your credit or debit card — be sure to check your card statements for possible fraud.' She also said that unverified reports point to a 'Central American gang that broke into the company's system by answering the application's knowledge-based authentication questions correctly.

The prince, a serving soldier himself, has built a reputation for championing military causes - not least because of September's Invictus Games. The Games, which Harry hopes to make an annual tradition, saw wounded servicemen from nine different countries compete in a host of paralympic sports, among them running, archery and wheelchair rugby. Today's service comes in the wake of receptions held by the Queen and Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace and St James's - all designed to honour Britain and the Commonwealth's bravest military and civilian heroes.

Although the Victoria Cross can only be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth Armed Forces, the George Cross can be awarded to civilians as well. Launched by George VI on the 24th September 1940, it was initially intended to recognise the efforts of Londoners attempting to deal with the Blitz but was soon expanded to apply to members of the Armed Forces who display 'gallant conduct in the face of the enemy'.

However, the New Zealand government have allegedly not replied to his requests for a new passport. In an interview with Aotearoa Independent Media Centre, the bearded Kiwi said he plans to leave Syria around late October. 'I only went there for adventure Jihad, but along the way I realised Syria is in a very dire need of humanity aid and support,' he said, refuting his alleged terrorist activities.

Taylor, who is in his early 40s, now goes by the name of Mohammad Daniel and is also known as Abu Abdul-Rahman. In July this year he told the New Zealand Herald on Sunday that he would remain in Syria until he achieved 'martyrdom'. He said he became a jihad because he was 'refused by the NZ Army for re-enlistment'. In a 15 second video posted on YouTube in June, viewed by Daily Mail Australia, a man who is named as Taylor says: 'I am the New Zealander known as Mark John Taylor, my current location is in Syria and my commitment is for jihad, for Allah and his messenger.'

"The black designer silk and lace lingerie I bought for my honeymoon four years ago cost almost as much as the wedding. As far as I’m concerned, it’s worth every penny, because my husband still loves it. Despite being busy parents of a lively two-year-old boy, my husband, Tom, still fancies the pants off me and, if anything, that side of our relationship is better than before we had our son. Despite being busy parents of a lively two-year-old boy, Rachel says her husband, Tom, still fancies the pants off her . Our secret? I maintain it’s the fact that he wasn’t by my side at our son’s birth. And so does Tom — whenever he hears about celebrities like Robbie Williams making a song and dance about being at their wives’ side during labour, he declares: ‘That’s it for them. It’s all over for their sex lives. No man should have to watch his wife give birth. It is just plain wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.’ Far from being cross at his somewhat old-fashioned attitude, I agree with him. Not only do I believe men should not be there during the actual birth, I don’t think they should even enter the birthing suite. Like most modern women, I used to think very differently. I had always assumed that, when I gave birth, my husband would be there at my side. When I discovered I was pregnant in January 2012, I’d already been through two miscarriages. So, for the first couple of months, I was terribly cautious about making any plans for the birth. My fears were only allayed after my 20-week scan, when we were told we were expecting a healthy boy. Rachel and her son Tanoah. She says not only does she believe men should not be there during the actual birth, she doesn't think they should even enter the birthing suite . I began preparing for the baby’s arrival, but I guess alarm bells should have started ringing when Tom refused to go to our antenatal classes, saying he had no intention of sitting around, listening to a bunch of women talk about cracked nipples. He stuck to his guns, even when I told him how humiliating it was being the only woman there without her other half. So it was with trepidation that I approached the issue of him being my birthing partner. I explained that I really needed him by my side, that as I loved him more than anyone else, and he was responsible for my pregnant state, he simply had to hold my hand. I even said he could stay up at the ‘head-end’. He wouldn’t have to cut the cord, or ‘look downstairs’, as it were. But it was to no avail. The answer was the same: a straight, firm, and resolute ‘no’. Rachel and husband Tom, who is 24 years older than her, on their wedding day . The man I’ve loved for 13 years told me again and again there was absolutely no way he was having anything to do with the birth: he’d ‘done his bit’ and, anyway, he couldn’t stand the sight of blood. Maybe I should have seen it coming. Tom is from Fiji and belongs to a line of traditional, testosterone-fuelled men, who think the act of fertilisation is pretty much the beginning and end of their role when it comes to producing offspring. He is much older than me — 67 to my 43 — and is very traditional. He does the ‘manly’ things, like fixing our cars and mowing the lawn. Rachel says Tom is very traditional and refused to accompany her to antenatal classes . But to him, women’s stuff is women’s stuff. I cried, I screamed and even refused to speak to him for a week. Finally, I sat down and, through sobs, begged him to change his mind. It was then he revealed the truth. ‘I can’t,’ he said. ‘It’ll put me off sex with you for ever.’ His admission stopped me in my tracks. In that moment, I gave up the fight. I couldn’t bear for him not to see me in the same way. I didn’t want to become nothing more to him than a saggy-bellied, milk-soaked, mummy-type, who had lost her sex appeal.Despite my disappointment, my mum and best friend Anna, a nurse, kindly stepped in and became my birthing partners. Rachel says giving birth was an 'absolute nightmare of gore and horror' With hindsight, it was the best outcome for us all. The birth, in October 2012, was an absolute nightmare of gore and horror. I have never felt pain like it. Labour lasted 12 hours. I pushed for an hour-and-a-half, before the nurse told me my son’s head was stuck and I was whisked off to theatre for a forceps delivery. All the while, Tom, who had driven us all to The Great Western Hospital in Wiltshire, at 6am, was sitting patiently outside my hospital room. He had, at least, agreed to stay, rather than go home. Though that didn’t last — he popped his head around the door as the anaesthetist was preparing my spinal block to announce he was heading off to the pub. ‘Do text if you need me,’ he said. Far from being furious, I was relieved. I felt exposed and vulnerable. Him seeing me like this would have made things even worse. At one point, I was violently sick all over my best friend; my hair was stuck to my head with sweat; I was angry, in pain, and had my legs stuck in stirrups. I felt embarrassed. I didn’t want my husband to have the memory of his ‘top totty’ (his nickname for me) behaving like a crazed farmyard animal. There has to be a reason why, for years, men paced up and down the corridors, smoking cigarettes, outside bedrooms and hospital wards across the country. This was accepted behaviour for a reason — so a man could look at his wife as a mother, but also as the sexual being he fell in love with. At a recent girly get-together, my friend Samantha confessed that, in the two weeks since she had her second baby, her husband has kept reminding her to do her pelvic floor exercises. Apparently, having seen the head appear, he is fretting sex will never feel the same. Another friend confided that her husband had found their daughter’s birth traumatising. The first few times they’d attempted to make love, he found it impossible. A few months ago, I got a call from an old university friend. We used to be really close, so I wasn’t entirely surprised when he asked if he could tell me something he could never tell his wife. He went on to explain that, after watching her give birth, he’d been incapable of forgetting the memory. Rachel is satisfied that her husband's view of her hasn't changed since she gave birth to their son . He seriously thought that he had PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). As he went on, I began to feel really sorry for him and his wife. I knew she would be desperate to feel like a woman again, but he said that he just felt queasy at the thought of them resuming their former marital relationship. Meanwhile, I know for sure that my husband’s view of me hasn’t changed at all. Although it took me a while to feel like a woman again, our love life became better than ever, as my husband candidly said he fancied me even more, thanks to all my extra curves. Every couple’s sex life takes a while to adjust after the birth of a child. But what’s rarely alluded to is that it’s often the husbands who are reluctant to reconnect physically. They won’t admit they find it impossible to think of their wives sexually after witnessing them give birth, or that they feel they succumbed to peer pressure to stay by her side during labour. A view like mine might be unfashionable, but men being at the birth is a very recent phenomenon. Gordon Ramsay once said if he watched his wife in labour, his sex life would be damaged by images he’d only ever want to see in a sci-fi movie: ‘It would feel like skinned rabbits and conger eels coming at me from everywhere. I didn’t want that to be in my memory.’ At the time, I felt really sorry for his wife, Tana, forced to live with such a dinosaur. But now, I can’t help but agree.","Rachel Rounds and her husband Tom are parents of a two-year-old boy .

"She's the make-up artist that gave Amal Clooney her bridal beauty and Kim Kardashian her flawless glow so it's hardly surprising that Abbey Clancy wanted a bit of Charlotte Tilbury's make-up magic. The model was treated to a live makeover by Charlotte, who is also Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss' beauty guru of choice, at Selfridges Exchange Square, Manchester. Charlotte treated Abbey to The Supermodel look; a look inspired by all the supermodels that she has worked with - and she's shared her step-by-step guide to getting the look with FEMAIL. Beauty buddies: Abbey was treated to a live makeover by Charlotte Tilbury at Selfridges Exchange Square, Manchester yesterday. Here, she shares her tips and tricks with FEMAIL ahead of Christmas party season . Describing the look, Charlotte said: 'Inspired by the heavenly supermodels of the 1990's and the trailblazing icons of today’s catwalk, from Linda, Cindy, Claudia, Helena and Naomi, to Kate, Cara, Jourdan, Joan and Miranda. 'The Supermodel is channelling the legendary make-up of these perfect, glamazon women who understand the power of the ultimate smoky eye paired with a sultry nude lip look. 'The sensuous smokey eyes, the killer cheekbones and the glossy, nude kissable lips that we all want. 'This look is like that chic little black dress that you can always fall back on, every time you put it on, you know you look gorgeous, glamorous and fabulous.' Get the look: Charlotte treated Abbey to The Supermodel look, which was inspired by the 'heavenly supermodels of the 1990's and the trailblazing icons of today’s catwalk' that she works with . She began by prepping Abbey's skin with her Magic Cream, which was named by the models backstage at fashion week, followed by her Wonder Glow, foundation and retoucher concealer to give her the mother-of-one a healthy glow. She then brushed up her brows and used a highlighter just below the arch of her brow. 'This is an old make-up artist trick that accentuates and lifts the brows,' explains Charlotte, before clamping her lashes with her 'push-up bra style eyelash curlers' and slicking on her mascara. To achieve Abbey's sultry smokey eye, she used her Luxury Eyeshadow Palette in Fallen Angel. Priming with a champagne shadow, she then used a beige colour in the corner and applied it using a brush in 'windscreen wiper' motion. Final touches: She completed the look with lip liner, which, she says, is an essential part of every supermodel's kit . 'You can use it wet for a dramatic effect, just pop a little bit of water onto your brush and apply the shadow for a really intense shade,' she adds. She used eyeliner along the lash line and finished with a little feline flick. 'Smudge some smokey shadow under the eyeline to add width to the eye,' she advises. She then instructed Abbey to suck in her cheeks so a natural shadow appeared and she applied bronzer there. She goes on to explain the importance of lip liner. 'Every supermodel is never without their lipliner' she says before outlining Abbey's lips and slicking on  her K.I.S.S.I.N.G lipstick. 'Always leave the blusher until last so you never overdo it,' she adds. Speaking about working with Abbey, she said: 'Abbey is the ultimate Supermodel. She has all the qualities of the divine 90s Amazonian Supermodels - limbs that last forever, sensual smoky eyes, killer cheekbones and heavenly, glossy, nude lips. I love working with her - she’s so lovely and has the perfect features for makeup.' If you want to emulate Abbey's exact look at home. Charlotte has created a new beauty box packed with the tools and a built-in video tutorial showing you how to apply it. Final look: Clearly thrilled with the results, Abbey posed for a photoshoot with her new look . The talking video box has been designed to combine the vintage style of a jewellery box and the technological ease of an iPad, so that beauty buffs can watch, learn and apply make-up simply by opening the lid. As you open the box, a video of Charlotte applying the make-up on a model along with a step-by-step guide begins playing. The box is also packed with items from Charlotte's make-up collection to help beauty aficionados create The Supermodel look; a look inspired by all the supermodels that she has worked with.

As well as working backstage at the most esteemed fashion shows, Charlotte is credited with transforming the likes of Millie Mackintosh, Suki Waterhouse and Margot Robbie. Poppy Delevingne even called on her to do her bridal make-up for her wedding earlier this year. So it's fair to say that Charlotte knows a thing or two about beauty. It is perhaps then little surprise that A-lister Kim Kardashian, 33, known for her love of dazzling red carpet looks, called on the make-up maestro to give her a Brit girl makeover when she landed in London recently. However, looking like an A-lister doesn't come cheap; Charlotte's box will set you back £200. One for the Christmas wish list?

"Curtis Davies has been revealed as the unwitting subject of a bizarre deception after pregnant model Josie Cunningham admitted she was tricked for 18 months into believing the father of her baby was the Hull City captain. The wannabe glamour model, who rose to fame after undergoing a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, claims she was 'manipulated' into having a relationship with a man who pretended to be the 29-year-old centre back.

"A first-edition Batman comic book worth $900,000 is among a cache of items that were allegedly stolen by  two veteran court investigators. Dustin Deutsch, 41, was indicted on Tuesday for felony theft by a public servant and tampering with evidence, according to The Houston Chronicle. Deutsch along with Lonnie Blevins, 39, his former partner at the Harris County District Attorney's Office in Texas are accused of stealing thousands of dollars worth of vintage comics. Prison: Anthony Chiofalo, a Houston  lawyer who has been on the run since June when he was accused of stealing more than $9 million from his employer, leaves the 339th state District Court, Monday, Jan. 7, 2013 . Both of the district attorney investigators allegedly stole the comic books which were evidence in an embezzlement case that they were investigating in May 2012 against Anthony Chiofalo. The case centered on Chiofalo, who, was accused of embezzling about $9 million from his client, a company that manufactures heavy cranes. He bought sports memorabilia including a baseball helmet signed by Pete Rose, rare comic books and other collectibles with the stolen cash. Authorities were called in after the crane company discovered the missing funds. Meanwhile, Chiofalo kept hundreds of the items bought with the cash in his home and a storage unit in Spring. During the investigation, investigator Deutsch had the keys to get into the storage units giving him ample opportunity to steal the items. In October 2012, Blevins sold thousands of dollars worth of rare comic books to a dealer in Chicago who later discovered they were the same items purchased by Chiofalo from an online auction house. Rare: In October 2012, Blevins sold thousands of dollars worth of rare comic books to a dealer in Chicago . An attorney representing the company Chiofalo had worked for learned about the comics and recognized the name of the seller: Harris County DA's investigator Lonnie Blevins. The FBI arrested Blevins in February 2013. Deutsch was suspended after Blevins was arrested and later resigned. The pair also own a private investigation business in Humble. Deutsch is being held in custody Tuesday with combined bail set at $405,000 for both charges. In May, Chiofalo was sentenced to 40 years in prison after pleading guilty to first-degree felony theft of more than $200,000.","Dustin Deutsch, 41, was indicted on Tuesday for felony theft .

"A senior Sun journalist was cleared yesterday of paying a corrupt tax official to get secrets from the Government’s Budget. Clodagh Hartley, 40, was accused of handing over £17,000 in exchange for leaks from Alistair Darling’s Budget in 2010 and embarrassing information about revenue officials and government waste. But yesterday the former Whitehall editor was acquitted of corrupting public officials after telling jurors she was just ‘doing her job’ getting stories that were in the public interest and exposing Whitehall ‘spin’. Journalist Clodagh Hartley, pictured, was acquitted of corrupting public officials at the Old Bailey yesterday . The mother of two is the first Sun journalist charged under Scotland Yard’s Operation Elveden, the investigation into alleged cash payments to public officials for stories, to be cleared. She maintained that her source, Jonathan Hall was a ‘whistleblower’ at HMRC where he worked as chief of the law enforcement desk. But it can now be revealed that Hall, 43, had previously pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office after receiving £17,475 over more than three years from The Sun for sensitive information on Alistair Darling’s final Budget in 2010 and stories on celebrities. The ‘greedy’ civil servant used the account of his girlfriend Marta Bukarewicz, 45, to hide most of the payments, but she was cleared of any wrongdoing. Miss Hartley sobbed in the dock yesterday, saying ‘thank you’, as she was cleared of paying out ‘easy money for lazy journalism’. She was arrested in 2012 after police were handed emails, texts and payment records containing evidence that Hall fed her stories between 2008 and 2011. Her three week trial at the Old Bailey heard that in March 2010 Hall was paid £750 for a double-page spread about policy decisions relating to the Budget and the Government’s deficit reduction plans. He was also paid £500 for a story in December 2009 about celebrities including Kelly Brook being paid as part of a £1.3 million taxpayer-funded TV campaign publicising the Government website Directgov. Jonathan Hall will be sentenced on February 6 after earlier pleading guilty to misconduct in public office . Prosecutor Zoe Johnson, QC, told jurors: ‘This is not a trial involving whistleblowing in a noble cause. It is a case in which Hall, the HMRC press officer, was motivated by greed and Miss Hartley, the journalist, was motivated by acquiring the next big scoop or exclusive.’ But Alexandra Healy QC, defending, said: ‘What it amounts to is she is on trial for that criminal offence for doing her job. ‘She made no secret of what she was doing. ‘Miss Hartley admits she requested that her employers paid money to Jonathan Hall and makes no secret of what she is doing. ‘We have to look at Miss Hartley’s actions on basis of the factual circumstances at the time and how political journalism has operated for years.’ During her trial, the journalist hit out at News International’s decision to hand over vast swathes of data to police comprising journalists’ confidential sources. She said it never occurred to her that she was doing anything illegal. The reporter, who had stints as The Sun’s Los Angeles correspondent as well as consumer affairs editor, said she wrote the Budget article because it was important for readers to get the story before it was subjected to ‘spin’. She argued other articles about a £1.3m campaign to promote a government department and the £24m cost of moving a schools authority from London to Coventry were in the public interest. She also said she wanted to expose the double standards amongst civil servants in Whitehall, where the culture of spin made it difficult to get to the truth. Former Mirror editor and media commentator Roy Greenslade, who gave evidence in her defence, insisted that leaks were the ‘lifeblood’ of political journalism in Britain. Jurors learnt that a series of articles supposedly based on confidential information bought by Hartley were irrelevant to the case. One article, ‘£20bn Black Hole Cheers’, printed on 26 March, 2010, was written two days after Labour’s 2010 Budget and contained nothing confidential. Another article uncovered by detectives was not even written by Hartley. Richard Lester, head of security at HMRC, admitted his department did not even looked into the supposedly damaging leaks at the time they were published. Hall, who joined HMRC in 2009, received more than £4,000 directly from News International between April 2008 and May 2010. A further £13,000 was channelled into his girlfriend’s account between June 2010 and July 2011. Miss Bukarewicz, who denied profiting £845 from the alleged scam, said Miss Hartley had suggested the arrangement to Hall because he was a ‘protected source’ and it was ‘standard practice at the Sun’. But after nearly two days of deliberations, the jury cleared her and Miss Bukarewicz of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. Yesterday Miss Hartley left court in tears. She has said she does not plan to return to journalism. Hall will be sentenced on February 6.

"A computer student suspected of trying to hack into police websites has been jailed for refusing to hand over his password in the interests of national security. University student Christopher Wilson caused the Northumbria Police website to shut down after ringing the force using a voice changing device to warn of a cyber attack. Wilson, who has Asperger's Syndrome, was caught sending online messages about 'trolling the Newcastle police department' and infiltrating the secret files of the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Christopher Wilson, 22, has been jailed for six months for refusing to hand over his computer passwords after earlier being suspected of trying to hack into police websites . The 22-year-old even suggested putting nasty messages on a condolence page set up for two female police officers shot dead in Manchester. Wilson, who is doing a Master's degree in computers and has set up his own business programming artificial intelligence systems, was studying at Northumbria University when he first came to the attention of police. After repeatedly refusing to provide his password for his encrypted computer, a judge last year ordered him to do so in the interests of national security. None of the 50 passwords he provided worked so he has now been jailed for six months for failing to provide his details. The Master's student has set up his own business programming artificial intelligence systems . Judge Simon Hickey told him: 'What you were doing was for your own satisfaction, showing what you could do with your undoubted skill with computers. 'But this is a serious offence and I can't avoid an immediate custodial sentence.' Police began investigating Wilson in October, 2012 after two emails were sent to the Vice Chancellor of Newcastle University saying a man had been making online threats to kill a member of his staff and that he had a handgun and ammunition. The message was sent under the username 'Catch 22', which was linked to Wilson's server. Police began investigating Wilson in October, 2012 while he was studying at Northumbria University, pictured above, after he emailed another university warning them about an online threat against one of their staff . Police went to Wilson's home in Milford Close, Washington, and seized computer equipment, including one system he had built himself which allowed remote access to other computers. Wilson denied making the university threats and claimed he had fallen out with a couple of Dutch men online and that the allegations were malicious. Prosecutors accepted he was telling the truth and he wasn't charged. Police still wanted to access his computer and the passwords he initially provided didn't work. Detectives later linked Wilson to a call made to them a month later warning that the Northumbria Police website was going to be attacked. The attack lasted for eight minutes and the website began to slow down before being taken down as a precaution for four minutes. Wilson was arrested in January last year and admitted making the call but claimed he was just warning them of a possible attack by someone else. Police then uncovered other messages he had sent from his Skype phone which included him saying, 'gonna (sic) go harass some police stations' and 'Let's troll Newcastle police department'. He also encouraged others to report a hoax mugging outside Newcastle's Centre for Life. Wilson also discussed hacking into the university network and getting passwords for 50 other students, the court heard. When his phone was examined, police found references to him carrying out another online attack on the Serious Organised Crime Agency and trolling a police memorial page. David Lister, defending, said: 'He has expressed genuine remorse, he bitterly regrets his actions. 'He was 19 at the time and the impact of his Autism Spectrum Disorder or Asperger's meant he matured more slowly than others.'","Christopher Wilson was ordered by a judge to hand over his password .

"They might have been waiting for Michele Bachelet, the well-respected President of Chile, but Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia only had eyes for each other. As they stood on the red carpet outside the El Pardo Palace awaiting Ms Bachelet, the couple, who married in 2004, exchanged loving glances - and continued to do so long after the South American premier had made her entrance. Later, the pair stood side by side as they took a salute from the guard of honour laid on for Ms Bachelet who was making her first visit to Spain since being elected president in March. Scroll down for video . The look of love: King Felipe and Queen Letizia exchange glances as they wait for President Bachelet .

In June, Ms Bachelet, a socialist, was left beaming after Prince Harry made a state visit to the country and met with her at the Palacio de La Moneda in Santiago. This time around, the president, who seems to be at risk of becoming a monarchist, was left smiling after a chat with King Felipe, 46, during which Letizia, 42, looked on. Letizia herself is fresh from a successful trip to Austria where she made a speech at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.

Big moment: The royal couple look on as they take a salute from the guard of honour laid on for Ms Bachelet . Pomp: The welcome ceremony at the El Pardo Palace saw ranks of soldiers dressed in their best file past . Big arrival: Ms Bachelet was making her first visit to Spain since being elected earlier this year . First visit: Prince Harry, pictured here in Santiago, was the first royal to shake the hand of the Chilean president . Delighted: Ms Bachelet appeared almost as delighted to meet King Felipe as she was to meet Prince Harry . All smiles: President Bachelet waves to photographers as she's escorted into the El Pardo by Queen Letizia . The speech, which was made partly in German and in English, was to art fans during the launch of an exhibition dedicated to the Spanish artist, Diego Velázquez. Velázquez, who was born in 1599, is best known for his 1656 work, Las Meninas, which is usually housed in Madrid's Prado Museum. The painting, which shows Infanta Margarita Teresa surrounded by her maids of honour and servants, was commissioned by Felipe IV - an ancestor of the current King Felipe. Las Meninas also has an Austrian connection as Infanta Margarita went on to become the Holy Roman Empress and wife of Leopold I who oversaw the running of his lands from the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. It was also at the Hofburg that Margarita died in 1673 aged just 21, although not before she gave her husband four children, all of whom - Maria Antonia, Electress of Bavaria notwithstanding - died in childhood. On their way: President Bachelet appeared to be enjoying her visit to Spain - her first since taking office . Dramatic: The smartly uniformed honour guard formed a dramatic backdrop for the welcome ceremony . Esteem: Unusually, the ceremony was held at the grand El Pardo Palace instead of the Zarzuela . All smiles: After bowing his head for the National Anthem, Felipe beamed broadly at the soldiers on parade . Despite the tragic story behind Las Meninas, it remains one of Velázquez' most famous paintings, if not the only one he did of Infanta Margarita. Letizia, although not famous for her love of art, has made supporting her native culture a key part of her role, and, last week, joined King Felipe for the launch of a new Spanish language dictionary. Much of her time has also been spent travelling, with successful visits to the UN in New York and to King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima in the Hague alongside King Felipe, among her most recent trips. Stylish: As is her wont, Queen Letizia cut a glamorous figure as she made her way down the El Pardo's steps . Nice to meet you: Queen Letizia was greeted by Austrian president Heinz Fischer and his wife, Margit in Vienna . Launch: She was in the Austrian capital for the launch of an exhibition dedicated to artist, Diego Velázquez . Striking: Diego Velázquez' most famous painting is Las Meninas, which was created for King Felipe VI .","The royal couple welcomed Michelle Bachelet to the El Pardo Palace .

"It's a seemingly death-defying stunt that has raised eyebrows over the internet. A man known only as Travis is filmed jumping out of a plane from 9,000ft and free-falling to the ground - without a parachute. What's more in the incredibly realistic footage, the thrillseeker flies through a hole in the roof of a building, and lands safely on a trampoline - to the applause of those waiting for him. The skydiver, named only as Travis, is seen jumping out of the plane with no parachute, but is it a fake? However, it's revealed that the video, which has gone viral since it was posted online just two days ago, is a stunt for a new trampoline park in the US. In the footage, a presenter explains that Travis will jump out of the plane without a parachute, fall through a three-by-five metre opening in the top of a roof, and land onto a trampoline. 'It's crazy, but we're going to do it,' he says. It is claimed that there are two things which make the highly implausible stunt possible: the reinforced trampolines that will absorb the impact from the jump, and a 'revolutionary' geomagnetic positioning system which Travis will wear on his belt. As the jumper reaches just under 300 feet, the target area  - a hole in the roof of a building becomes clear . The end of the video reveals that the skydiver, known as Travis, has safely landed onto a trampoline . 'The natural magnetism of the Earth and the magnet that we are attaching to Travis have a natural reaction to one another,' claims one of the stunt engineers featured in the video, adding that they will be able to steer Travis through the skyline exactly down onto the trampoline. 'We don't have a margin for error,' says the narrator. If Travis makes a mistake on this, it's catastrophic.' As the plane ascends, the team on the ground watch its progress on a computer screen. As tension mounts Travis yells: 'I'm throwing myself out of an aeroplane with no parachute!' The door opens and Travis and a female jumper, who is allegedly filming the stunt, hurl themselves out of the plane. The end of the video shows a crowd triumphantly cheering the success of the largely unbelievable stunt . Intensity grows as Travis flies full throttle towards the building, and reaches fever pitch as he plummets towards the opening in the top of it. 'I see it, I see it, I got it, I got it,' he shouts, before the screen goes blank and an error message appears saying 'Connection Lost'. The video ends triumphantly as the camera pans out to reveal a crowd cheering, as it is revealed the stunt has been pulled off. However, online critics have pointed out that it is unusual that the skydiver's voice seems unaffected by the  G-force, and the science behind the stunt is somewhat farcical. It has also been suggested that the video is in fact a marketing ploy of the brand new Factor6 trampoline park in New Orleans.","Video appears to be a stunt created to promote new trampoline park .

"This is the shocking moment a car bounced off the front of a lorry on a busy motorway sending it flying across the road after the driver pulled out without checking their mirrors. The HGV was travelling in the middle lane of the M6 in Staffordshire at 35mph during wet weather conditions when it approached a blue Nissan Note. The car driver then forgot to check their mirrors and pulled out to change lanes, clipping the lorry and losing control before bouncing across the carriageway. The lorry, which was fitted with a dash cam, was travelling along the M6 in Staffordshire when it approached a blue Nissan Note . The driver of the blue Nissan appears to forget to check their mirrors and pulls out in front of the HGV . The Nissan was sent spinning so it ended up facing oncoming traffic before it clipped the side of a £50,000 BMW 5 Series GT. It then came to a halt after rolling backwards through traffic cones. Fortunately no one was injured during the crash, which took place earlier this year. However, the driver of the Nissan then blamed the lorry driver for the incident when it came to an insurance claim. But the trucker had a dash cam fitted and the insurers of Nissan driver settled the claim as soon as the were shown the footage. Simon Marsh, managing director of SmartWitness, which made the dash cam, said: 'This new video perfectly illustrates the camera's worth. 'These incidents in the days before cameras would result in a big drain on time and expense as both sides argued it out with insurers and also risked damaging hauliers’ insurance claim experience. 'Not any more - the footage goes off and it is settled almost instantly.' The car then bounces off the front of the HGV, which sends it flying across the carriageway . The blue Note ends up facing oncoming traffic and eventually clips the side of a BMW 5 Series before coming to a halt near to the traffic cones . Thousands of similar incidents happen on Britain’s roads each year - with both drivers blaming each other for the collision. More and more motorists are buying dash cams though in the event they find themselves in a criminal or insurance dispute. The Road Haulage Association recently found that 54 per cent of its members have now fitted in-cab cameras. There are around 550,000 whiplash claims filed every year in the UK, but insurance experts have estimated that up to 60 per cent are bogus. Since 2006, there has been a 60 per cent rise in the number of personal injury claims.This is despite number of reported accidents on UK roads dropping by 20 per cent during the same period.","The HGV was travelling in the middle lane of M6 at 35mph in wet weather .

"If you have ever wondered how common your birthday is, look no further. A U.S. graduate has produced a series of charts revealing how birthdays rate against each other. The graphs, created from  federal government data, show that most American babies are born in the late summer, while the least are delivered on major holidays. Scroll down for video . Revealed: A U.S. graduate has produced three charts revealing how birthdays rate against each other. They show that most American babies are born in late summer, while the least are delivered on major holidays . Perhaps unsurprisingly, September 12, 18, 25 and 26 - which are all around nine months after the holiday season - were found to be the most common days for births. They helped make up a total of 12,250 children born per day in the summer, compared to just 11,390 in the winter. This contrast in numbers is widely believed to be due to the cold weather experienced during the winter months, which encourages more people to stay indoors and spend cosy evenings in. University of Viriginia student Dan Lin produced the charts using data from 1994-2003 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) records, before posting them to Reddit.

But Valentine's Day was popular . They show that public holidays - including Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year's Day and the Fourth of July, as well as the February 29 - are the least-likely days for births. While February 29 is understandably rare as it comes around only every four years, the cause for the fewest birthdays on holidays is likely due to fewer cesarean sections being carried out. Most public hospitals in America refuse to schedule c-sections on national holidays - with the exception of emergencies - while many private hospitals will arrange fewer. Reddit users have also speculated  that some doctors may deliberately induce a pregnancy so the birth occurs on a more convenient day. Standing out: University of Viriginia student Dan Lin produced the charts using data from 1994-2003 CDC records. Strikingly, the day with the most American births was found to be September 9, 1999 - or 9/9/99 . Despite the apparent lack of births of public holidays, Valentine's Day and Friday the 13th were ranked among the most common for deliveries, with an average of 12,210 and 11,210 respectively. Strikingly, the day with the most American births was found to be September 9, 1999 - possibly due to a high number of parents wanting their child to have a 9/9/99 birth date.

"A teenager who couldn't drink a glass of water without being sick was found to have a massive hair ball blocking her digestive system. Ayperi Alekseeva, from Kyrgyzstan, had spent years picking up hair from the carpet and eating it. She also chewed the tips of her hair. When she finally sought medical help, doctors pulled out a hairball weighing almost 9lb (4kg). They say without emergency surgery, the 18-year-old, who was badly dehydrated and malnourished, would almost certainly have died. Scroll down for video .

They add that despite searching through 50 years of medical records, they could find no evidence of such a large hairball. Miss Alekseeva had been brought to the hospital, in the town of Batken, by her parents after complaining of severe stomach pains. After X-raying her, doctors realised there was a blockage and referred her to   Bishkek Hospital in country's capital for surgery. The hospital's senior professor of surgery, Bahadir Bebezov,said: 'The parents brought her in after she started losing weight, and she couldn't eat anything. 'By the time we got her, she couldn't even drink water. We realised we needed to operate immediately. 'It was actually the only alternative, nothing else would solve the problem. 'In fact, her stomach was so badly swollen from hair and bits of wool from the carpet that it literally just oozed out soon as the wall of the stomach was cut.'

"Extreme temperatures, flash flooding is set to become far more common towards the end of the century, a group of respected scientists has predicted. Changes in weather patterns globally will make people, especially ageing populations, far more vulnerable to extreme hot spells, according to a report published by the Royal Society. And the experts also predict that the impact of blazing summers will increase ten-fold by 2100, while the impact of flooding will more than quadruple over the same period, the report estimates. Scientists calculated the impact of climate change and population changes on the chances of people being affected by floods, droughts and heatwaves around the world. These maps reveal the estimated changes, shown as ratios for the period 2080 to 2099, compared to the period of 1986 to 2005 . Scientists calculated the impact of climate change and population changes on the chances of people being affected by floods, droughts and heatwaves around the world. Extended hot periods like that seen in 2003 - when temperatures soared to 101°F (38.5°C) and railway tracks buckled in the heat - will become far more common. More than 2,000 people are thought to have died of heat-related causes in the UK in 2003, along with 20,000 in the rest of Europe. Roads melted, trains were forced to slow down because of warped tracks, and hosepipe bans were imposed across the country. The report focuses on the risks to people from floods, droughts and heatwaves. Drier parts of the world are expected to get drier and wetter parts, wetter. Increasing population numbers in areas that are exposed to extreme weather events exacerbate the risks from floods and droughts in many regions - especially East, West and Central Africa, India and South-East Asia. Over-65s are one of the groups most vulnerable to heatwaves, which could hit the UK and Europe. Changes in temperature and humidity could result in significant reductions in ability to work outdoors across much of Africa, Asia, and parts of North, South and Central America. This would impact rural communities and food production for a growing global population. Animals in zoos were treated with sun-tan cream and their food was frozen into ice lollies. The new research suggests that such events could become much more common in years to come. Scientists adopted a ‘worst case’ scenario by assuming an increase in average temperatures around the world of up to 4.8°C by 2100. The researchers defined a heatwave as a run of five days during which night-time temperatures are at least 5°C above the norm. Professor Peter Cox, from the University of Exeter - one of the authors of the Royal Society report, said: ‘We measure exposure to individuals. That goes up because of more extreme events and because the size of the vulnerable population increases. ‘Climate change increases the risk to people by a factor of two or three and population change multiplies that by at least 1.5 and up to four times in the case of heatwaves.’ The report also found a dramatically increased risk of exposure to flooding in the UK and parts of western Europe, while the threat of drought hung over the Mediterranean. Climate change is expected to make wetter parts of the world wetter and drier parts drier. The report issued an urgent call to both governments and private companies to do more to address extreme weather hazards. Scientists adopted a ‘worst case’ scenario by assuming an increase in average temperatures around the world of up to 4.8°C by 2100. Climate change is expected to make wetter parts of the world wetter and drier parts drier (pictured) This chart shows the global average surface temperature change as predicted in the report. The blue section is based on the best case scenario, while the red section depicts how hot the globe will become if the worst case scenario happens up to 2100 . Engineering solutions such as dams, sea walls and levees were often costly and also at risk of failing ‘cataclysmically’, it was claimed. Co-author Rowan Douglas, chairman of the Willis Research Network - which advises public and private institutions on risk, said it city planners need to factor in the increased likelihood of extreme weather events. Between 1980 and 2004 the total cost of extreme-weather related events came to US$1.4 trillion (of which only a quarter was insured. Floods, droughts and heatwaves also cost lives. Populations in poorer countries make up only 11 per cent of those exposed to hazards but account for 53 per cent of disaster mortality, according to the report. It compares various practical options for the most effective and affordable defence against the impacts of extreme weather events and calls for governments and private companies to work together in order to protect people. The Royal Society report also calls for changes to regulations to ensure financial experts are aware of the risks of extreme weather events. Currently, business surveys, economic forecasts and country briefings that guide investment decisions and credit ratings are typically based on the availability of skilled labour, access to export markets, political and economic stability, and financial incentives – but there is little or no consideration of actual or potential exposure to disaster risks. Experts want this to change. ‘We will re-build most of the world’s cities in the next 30 years, literally,’ he said. ‘We have a choice whether to build them to be vulnerable or resilient.’ Professor Georgina Mace, from University College London - who chaired the Royal Society working group, said: ‘Resilience means people are able to do more than just cope with disastrous events. They’re not just absorbing the impact, they’re able to continue living their lives and to prepare for future such events.’ The report was welcomed by climate scientists and green groups, who said it is a wake-up call to governments around the world. Professor Andrew Watkinson of the University of East Anglia said: ‘This timely report reminds us that extreme weather events affect us all, that we are not as resilient to current extreme events as we could be and that the nature of extreme events is likely to change in the future. ‘It also highlights the range of actions we can take to increase our resilience in a changing world and the key roles that governments together with their agencies and the insurance industry must play. ‘At a time when deep cuts are being made in public spending it is essential that government does not lose sight of its key role in enabling resilience at both the international and national level.’ Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: ‘As the anniversary of Britain's wettest winter ever approaches, this Royal Society report is a timely wake-up call for politicians to get serious about protecting the country from climate change. ‘The Chancellor must use next week’s Autumn Statement to invest seriously in flood defence schemes to protect hundreds of thousands of UK households and businesses increasingly at risk from extreme weather. ‘George Osborne must also do far more to tackle climate change in the first place – ending tax breaks for dirty gas and oil and investing in a massive energy efficiency programme instead would be a good first step.'

"Swimmers are at risk of being attacked in British waters by killer grey seals, a new report has warned. The large carnivorous mammals have been blamed for a spate of mysterious mutilations of harbour porpoises in the North Sea. Many of the carcasses were washed up on Dutch shores frequented by human bathers who may also be endangered by attacks from the vicious predators. WARNING: CONTAINS GRAPHIC CONTENT . Seals are being blamed for a spate of mysterious mutilations of harbour porpoises in the North Sea. The grey seal's preferred diet is mostly fish, and it had never been previously known to hunt harbour porpoises. The UK is home to more than 180,000 grey seals, more than a third of the world's population, with about 90 per cent around Scotland. Now tell-tale DNA found in fatal, sharp-edged wounds on porpoises around the southern North Sea has revealed a dark side to the creatures. Experts say the seals probably first grab their victims with their heavily armed beaks, before tearing off large sections of the calorie rich blubber. The mutilated body of a porpoise shows the fatal wounds believed to have been inflicted by a grey seal . Evidence from 1,081 autopsies indicates grey seals to be involved in 25 per cent of the cases, showing they are regular porpoise predators and may also have swimmers in their sights. The attacks may have been learned behaviour causing by fishing nets. The study suggests that grey seals originally scavenged the bodies of porpoises which had become entangled in fishing nets and drowned. Once getting a taste for them, they then moved on to hunting the animals, and may soon be hunting humans, said the researchers. ‘Most of the porpoises are juvenile, so they were very small,’ Ken Collins, a senior research fellow, Ocean and Earth Science at University of Southampton told MailOnline . ‘Seals are very nippy underwater. Here in the south we have evidence of them catching salmon in the sea. They are quite fast and the thought is the seals moved from scavenging to attacking young porpoises.’ Many of the porpoises targeted  had thin blubber and lots of parasites. Although they can move faster than seals, they often rest at the sea surface. They may have been ambushed by the seals, and been too weak to react fast enough. Grey seals are also very territorial, and despite their cuddly reputation can be vicious creatures. Their usual diet consists of fish, crabs, squid, and at times sea birds. They grab onto their prey using claws on their front flippers while ripping into skin and flesh with their teeth. This same feeding style would have caused the injuries seen on the porpoises. Mr Collins said it is ‘extremely unlikely’ grey seals would attack humans given how they interact with divers. He also doesn’t believe this type of behaviour would extend to the common seal, who is smaller. Biologist Dr Mardik Leopold, of the Institute for Marine Resources and Ecosystem Studies at Wageningen in Holland, said: 'We show a substantial proportion of harbour porpoises that stranded on the Dutch coast were mutilated by grey seals. 'We also conclude most cases involved active killing and only a small proprtion can be attributed to post mortem scavenging. 'This makes predation by grey seals one of the main causes of death in harbour porpoises currently stranding in The Netherlands.' Photographs of the dead porpoises showed chunks of skin, blubber and muscle ripped out, puncture wounds on the head and broken jaws, revealing the ferocity of the attacks. Acute haemorrhages indicated the wounds were inflicted during life, just before death. Partly digested prey in the stomachs showed they had recently fed. The attacks may have been learned behaviour caused by fishing nets. The study suggests that grey seals originally scavenged the bodies of porpoises which had become entangled in fishing nets and drowned. Once getting a taste for them, seals then moved onto hunting the animals. ‘Most of the porpoises are juvenile, so they were very small,’ Ken Collins, a senior research fellow, Ocean and Earth Science at University of Southampton told MailOnline. ‘Seals are very nippy underwater.

Their diet consists of fish, crabs, squid, and at times, sea birds. They usually grab onto their prey using claws on their front flippers while ripping into skin and flesh with their teeth. This same feeding style would have caused the injuries seen on the porpoises. The harbour porpoise's wounds (pictured) are thought to be caused by the seals' sharp beaks and claws . The researchers believe their estimate of grey seal attacks on porpoises is 'probably conservative'. They say mutilated carcasses with an open stomach or throat wound usually sink rapidly, so can go unrecorded. Animals that initially escaped an attack may also have died later from wounds inflicted. Dr Leopold said: 'The porpoise population may suffer in ways other than loss of individuals as most of the mutilated animals were healthy and fat prior to the attack suggesting grey seals primarily target juvenile harbour porpoises that are in prime condition and so probably reduce recruitment to breeding age.' The first grey seal victim was found in 2003, but without accurate information from earlier years it is not known when or why the behaviour first occurred. Bodies of the porpoises have been washing up on beaches in the Netherlands (pictured) that are popular with swimmers . Bodies of mutilated carcasses have washed up on the popular Dutch island of Texel (pictured), just north of Amsterdam . A grey seal stalks the waters of Duncansby Head, in Caithness, Scotland. The predators are now thought to be responsible for widespread predation of harbour porpoises in the North Sea . Dr Leopold added: 'Many of the mutilated porpoises were found on Dutch shores used frequently by human bathers and surfers and there would appear to be no reason why humans may not be at risk from grey seal attacks.' The harbour porpoise, one of the smallest marine mammals at just over six feet long, is not under threat of extinction. There are about 350,000 in the North Sea, half the world's population. Grey seals can reach a length of up to 11 feet and a weight of more than 660lbs (300 kilograms). They can outweigh a harbour porpoise by a factor of four or more.","Experts discover grey seals are mutilating and killing harbour porpoises .

"An airline passenger has shared an image showing the terrifying moment a screw flew off a plane mid-flight and smashed into his window. Travelling on an Air Canada flight to Vancouver, the passenger heard a noise and saw a screw come loose from the propeller before it embedded in the window pane by his seat. Calling himself Skips_LegDay, the traveller posted pictures on the social media site Reddit, confirming that the pilot of the flight said he had never seen anything like it before. The user, called Skips_LegDay posted images of him posing with the screw embedded in the window . The user explained: 'So about halfway through my flight I heard a loud POP, looked out my window at a bolt that flew off the prop and broke through the outer pane.' The noise caused concern among passengers, who became worried once they saw what had happened. Skips_LegDay explained: 'People around me heard it and seemed nervous once they saw the source of the sound. I got up and went to the FA [flight attendant] and quietly told her what happened, she came over to see it then called the pilot. He said it will be fine until we land as the cabin's pressurized. 'Once we landed and people stopped snapping pics, the pilot talked to me for a while. Said he's never seen this happen in over 25 years of flying.' The passenger said the pilot told him he had never seen anything like in all his years of flying . After posting the pictures the passenger joked that he was 'getting drunk' in Vancouver Airport as he had a second flight on the same model plane - believed to be a Bombardier Dash 8 - in the next three hours. When questioned by others about whether the plane landed safely, the passenger explained that it did, but that the airline had since taken it out of service to fix the window panel. He confirmed he would not complain as 'nothing bad happened' and the airline was already having to deal with delays caused by the incident. Following a further conversation with the pilot, the user updated interested followers further, explaining that the captain had told him even aircraft manufacturer Bombardier had never seen an incident of a screw coming loose and embedding itself in a window. A spokesperson for Air Canada confirmed to MailOnline Travel: 'There are twelve one-inch (2.5 cm) bolts on a ""prop spinner"" on this particular type of aircraft (Dash 8 #300). 'While on descent into Vancouver on Nov. 25/14, (from Penticton, BC) flight #8353 had one of those twelve one- inch (2.5 cm) bolts come loose and strike one of the aircraft windows. The bolt struck the exterior pane (of two acrylic window panes) which resulted in a small hole in the exterior window pane - the interior pane was not impacted.' The spokesperson continued: ''There was no emergency declared and the aircraft landed safely and without incident. This is a highly unusual incident and our maintenance personnel in Vancouver have inspected the aircraft and are making the necessary repairs. 'We do apologize to our passengers for any concern that this incident may have caused.' The loose screw comes just weeks after a propeller on an Air Canada flight smashed into a plane during take-off injuring a passenger. Christina Kurylo was on board a flight from Calgary to Grande Prairie, Alberta, when a tyre burst resulting in the propeller smashing into the fuselage. Miss Kurylo was one of four people taken to hospital following the incident and said she felt lucky to have escaped with her life.","Passenger was on board flight to Vancouver when he heard a 'pop' sound .

"A survey has revealed the cars most likely to be given a ticket on America's roads – and the results prove it is not all about horsepower. The study found that the Subaru WRX tops the national ranking - and one in three drivers of the turbocharged vehicle has a recent traffic violation. But while the ‘Ticket Magnet’ list of hundreds of vehicles includes the likes of the eight-cylinder Alpha Romeo 8c Competizone, the top 20 includes less high-octane models, including  the Suzuki Reno and the Mercury Topaz. A study carried out by Insurance.com found that drivers of the Subaru WRX were the most likely to be ticketed . The Pontiac GTO was second on the 'ticket magnet' list of cars most likely to draw a traffic violation . But the top ten list included some surprising entries - including the Mercury Topaz . The insurance comparison website insurance.com said it looked at data from 526 models and more than 557,000 recent customers between January 2013 and July 2014 to draw up its list. After the Suburu WRX, the Pontiac GTO, Scion FR-S, Toyota Supra and Subaru Tribeca made up the top five. The rest of the top ten includes the Volkswagen Rabbit, the Mercury Topaz, the Scion tC, the Toyota FJ Cruiser and the Mazda2. The list, which included the Scion FR-S (pictured) at number three, was compiled using data from 526 different models . The Toyota Supra came in fourth on the list of cars most likely to draw tickets, according to a survey by Insurance.com . Surprising: While the list included high powered vehicles, the Volkswagen Rabbit came in sixth on the top ten list . The most-ticketed brand overall was Scion, with 27.5 per cent of all owners reporting a traffic violation. 1. Subaru WRX – 33.6% . 2. Pontiac GTO – 32.7% . 3. Scion FR-S – 32.6% . 4. Toyota Supra – 30.8% . 5. Subaru Tribeca – 29.7% . 6. Volkswagen Rabbit – 29.6% . 7. Mercury Topaz – 28.8% . 8. Scion tC – 28.8% . 9. Toyota FJ Cruiser – 28.4% . 10. Mazda2 – 28.1% . But the high powered Dodge Viper (at 5.3 per cent) was far less likely to be ticketed than the Dodge Dart and 26.7 per cent. Insurance.com Managing Editor Des Toups said it was not all about powerful vehicles. ‘Cars don’t get tickets, drivers do – but those drivers like the WRX,' he said. ‘It’s not about horsepower. The Chevrolet Corvette, Dodge Viper and Nissan GT-R rank well below average for tickets even though they can easily double the highest speed limits. 'But those cars are also costly, so their buyers tend to be older and take fewer risks.’ For all models, nearly 20 per cent of drivers reported having a traffic violation in the previous three years. This would usually be for speeding but also included such offenses as failure to yield and drunken driving. According to CBS, the car least likely to get ticketed is the Chevrolet Orlando - a 'concept' mini-van with no reported tickets. The Mazda2 appeared at number ten in the list with 28.1 per cent of drivers having a recent ticket . The Scion tC was ranked at number eight in the list. Des Toups from Insurance.com said: 'It’s not about horsepower' The Subaru Tribeca appears on the list with 29.7 per cent of drivers found to have recent tickets, the survey revealed . Toyota FJ Cruiser came in ninth on the list. Data was drawn from more than 557,000 recent customers between January 2013 and July 2014 . Mr Toups said that when setting rates on particular vehicles, insurance companies paid more attention to claims than tickets. He added: 'If you have an accident, it helps to drive up the rates of everyone who owns that kind of car. 'Tickets tend to drive up your rates alone.'","Study finds the Subaru WRX is car most likely to draw a ticket on the roads .

"Britain’s drink-driving hotspots were revealed today - with a small town in Wales found to have the highest proportion of convictions for driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The ‘Postcodes of Shame’ results were published by MoneySuperMarket, which analysed 11million car insurance quotes from the last 12 months to determine which postcode areas had the highest and lowest proportion of motorists with drink or drug-drive offences listed on their policies. Llandrindod Wells emerged at the top of the table - an area in mid-Wales where the conviction rate was 1.98 offences per 1,000 drivers. Worst place: Llandrindod Wells (pictured) emerged at the top of the table - an area in mid-Wales where the conviction rate was 1.98 offences per 1,000 drivers . The second-worst area was Blackpool (1.85 offences per 1,000 drivers), followed by Crewe (1.81), Swansea (1.76) and Inverness (1.72). The rest of the worst-offending top ten was Cardiff (1.71), Kirkcaldy in Scotland (1.70), Shrewsbury (1.70), Darlington (1.69) and Northampton (1.67). By contrast, Londoners are least likely to have drink or drug-driving convictions per head of population. London postcodes dominated the least-convicted table, with the East (E), NW (NW) and North (N) codes taking up the first three positions. The London E area had a rate of just 0.76 offences per 1,000 drivers. Other than London and Greater London areas, the postcode districts with the lowest proportion of offenders included Bradford (0.81 per 1,000 drivers), Liverpool (0.90), Huddersfield (1.04) and Manchester (1.05). Drink-drivers face a driving ban of at least 12 months, a fine of up to £5,000, and in some cases, a prison sentence of up to six months. Yet the report says more convictions are appearing on insurance quotes with each offence adding up £350 to an annual car insurance premium when the driver does get his or her licence back. The MoneySuperMarket report says: ‘The rate in the rural Welsh LD postcode is more than double the rate among motorists living in some Greater London postcodes. ‘ . Another drink-driving hotspot: The second-worst area was Blackpool (1.85 offences per 1,000 drivers) But it also notes: ‘The Scottish postcodes of Inverness (IV), Kirkcaldy (KY), Aberdeen (AB), Dundee (DD) and Galashiels (TD) also feature in the top 20, as do Welsh hotspots Swansea (SA), Cardiff (CF) and Newport (NP).’ The report says: ‘Drivers in Scotland – including English drivers crossing the border - should be aware that the legal limit for alcohol in Scotland is being reduced on December 5, 2014.’ * The figure gives the drink or drug-drive conviction rate per 1,000 drivers in area . The current limit is 80mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood; it will fall to 50mg. This effectively means that one drink could put someone over the limit. The report also points out: ‘Looking at postcodes with relatively few convictions for drink and drug-driving, there is a proliferation of locations – 10 out of 20 – that are within the M25 and on the periphery of central London. This might be because the area benefits from good public transport.’ A further breakdown of car insurance convictions found motorists aged 20 to 24 are the most likely to have a drink and drug conviction on their licence, at a rate of 2.5 per 1000 drivers. This compares to 0.7 per 1,000 for drivers aged 17 to 19 years old, some of whom are only just old enough to drink legally and learn to drive. Male motorists are more than twice as likely to offend as women, with conviction rates at 1.7 per 1,000 male drivers, compared to 0.7 per 1,000 female counterparts. Kevin Pratt, car insurance expert at MoneySuperMarket, sought to answer why offending rates were higher in some areas than others. Capital roads: Londoners are least likely to have drink or drug-driving convictions per head of population . He said: ‘There are serious consequences for those caught breaking the drink and drug-driving laws. All right-minded people understand that drink or drug-driving is wrong. ‘In a rural location such as Llandrindod Wells it could be the lack of public transport and the misguided belief they won’t get caught. Or maybe motorists are driving the morning after the night before, when they still have excess alcohol in their system. ‘Whatever the circumstances, the fact remains that driving while over the limit is always illegal - there is simply no excuse.’ Mr Pratt noted: ‘Even after a ban is served, a conviction will see insurance premiums shoot up by an average £350 – which is more than the cost some people’ s policies in the first place.’ He added: ‘With five Scottish postcodes featuring in our top 20 it will be interesting to see what effect the new, lower drink-drive limit will have. Many drivers are already being caught and convicted for drink and drug-driving, and many more could get caught out by the change in the law.’ Peter Rodger, chief examiner at the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: ‘It’s nearly 50 years since breathalysers were introduced yet incredibly there are still people drink-driving and putting lives at risk. ‘Motorists have to face the consequences of their actions. The message is really simple. If you are driving, don’t drink at all. If you are drinking, don’t drive at all.’ In 2013, Aberdeen (AB) topped the chart of over the limit drivers with a rate of 1.5 per 1000 drivers.","'Postcodes of Shame' study looked at 11m car insurance quotes in year .

"Internet mogul Kim Dotcom says he is broke and facing jail in New Zealand . Internet mogul Kim Dotcom, accused of pocketing more than $175 million from pirated copies of movies and other material, claims he is broke and facing jail in New Zealand. In a live video link from his multi-million dollar mansion, the German-born entrepreneur said he had no money left to defend himself at a bail hearing in Auckland. 'I'm defenseless and they're using that opportunity to try and get my bail revoked and that's what I'm facing on Thursday,' Dotcom said in the link to to the UnBound Digital conference in England. 'This might be my last public appearance and if I go back to jail you can tell everybody that was the one,' he added. The mogul, whose New Zealand lawyers recently quit, claimed he has spent $10million on legal costs since he was arrested in a dramatic police helicopter swoop on his mansion in January 2012. 'They have certainly managed to drain my resources,' he said. Dotcom is fighting extradition to the United States, facing charges in what prosecutors say is one of the biggest criminal copyright theft cases ever brought. Police seized millions of pounds, a vast collection of luxury cars and sawn-off shotguns when they raided the mansion, and officers had to cut their way in to arrest the mogul after he retreated into a fortified safe room. The Megaupload operation at the center of the piracy accusations is a Hong Kong-based ‘cyberlocker’ service that allows users to download pirated films, TV shows, music and e-books with just a few clicks. It has been shut down, and Dotcom said shares in his new data storage company Mega were held in trust by his wife and children. He and his wife separated earlier this year. Dotcom, who was born Kim Schmitz, was granted New Zealand residency despite his criminal background after investing £8million in government bonds and making a generous donation to the Christchurch earthquake fund. Dotcom, who was born Kim Schmitz, was known for living the high life when his Megaupload site active . Dotcom was speaking from hi multi-million dollar property in Coatesville, near Auckland, New Zealand, . He said he also regretted dabbling in politics when he invested several million dollars in a new political party which failed to win a seat in New Zealand's September general election. 'Before I started my political movement, I was quite popular in New Zealand. Everyone was cheering for me to win my case,' he said. 'But after I got involved in politics and the prime minister and his party attacked me viciously, labelling me as a Nazi and saying I'm only going into politics to stop my extradition, well the New Zealand public heard that narrative and now I'm a pariah. Dotcom's garish pink Cadillac is seized by police in 2012. He said his flamboyance made him an easy target . A number of Mercedes are take from Dotcom's mansion during the police raid, in which police seized millions of pounds, as well as sawn-off shotguns . 'The witch-hunt worked, everyone wants to see me burn, and on Thursday I might go to jail because of that.' He also admitted his flamboyance made him an easy target. 'When you travel around on private jets and you go around with cars that have number plates saying 'God', 'Stoned' and 'Mafia' on them, it's probably not the best for keeping a low profile.' The US Justice Department and FBI claim Megaupload and related sites netted more than $175 million in criminal proceeds, and cost copyright owners more than $500 million by offering pirated copies of movies, TV shows and other content. Dotcom admitted that his lavish lifestyle, which included travel on private jets and a fleet of luxury cars, had not been ideal for keeping a low profile . Megaupload executive Bram van der Kolk (left) Finn Batato (second from left) Mathias Ortmann and founder Kim Dotcom (right) appear in North Shore District Court in Auckland . Megaupload was unique not only because of its massive size and the volume of downloaded content, but also because it had high-profile support from celebrities, musicians and other content producers who are most often the victims of copyright infringement and piracy. Before the site was taken down, it posted a statement saying allegations that it facilitated massive breaches of copyright laws were ‘grotesquely overblown’. Megaupload is considered a 'cyberlocker', in which users can upload and transfer files that are too large to send by email. Such sites can have perfectly legitimate uses. Swizz Beatz (pictured left with his wife Alicia Keys) was listed as CEO of the company and Kanye West (center) and Kim Kardashian (right) were apparently meant to be fans of the site . But the MPAA, which has campaigned for a crackdown on piracy, alleged that the vast majority of content being shared on Megaupload was in violation of copyright laws. The website allowed users to download films, TV shows, games, music and other content for free, but made money by charging subscriptions to people who wanted access to faster download speeds or extra content. The website also sold advertising. Several sister sites were also shut down, including one dedicated to sharing pornography files. The Megaupload homepage, which has now been taken down, boasted the endorsement of a string of high-profile celebrities .","Mogul said he has no money left to defend himself at Auckland bail hearing .

"A 45-year-old Florida woman faces prison time for allegedly making a string of bogus 911 calls regarding her husband's misbehavior. Sheri Lynn Hunt from Fort Walton Beach is accused of calling emergency services in the early hours of November 18 to report that her husband had locked himself in a bedroom. However, when police responded to the incident at 3.22am, Hunt reportedly changed her story and said she needed help finding a check.

According to the arrest report obtained by MailOnline, Hunt started arguing and stated that it was an emergency. In the end she backed down and said  would not repeat the offense. Police warned her she would be arrested if he did it again and made sure she had a non-emergency contact for the local police department. But more than an hour later at 4.55am, Hunt called again to report that her husband had stolen $85 from her, according to the report. When troopers arrived, Hunt's husband said he hadn't taken money from her and that he'd told her not to call 911 again. She was arrested and charged with misuse of 911. Fort Walton Beach Police officers note that Hunt is known for habitually calling in with false reports and has been charged for the same crime previously. Her next court date is scheduled for December 9.

"Former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson, who is to address the Oxford Union this evening . The Oxford Union has provoked anger after inviting former English Defence League leader and convicted criminal Tommy Robinson to address students. Mr Robinson, who left the EDL earlier this year, will speak at 8pm this evening, even though academics and politicians have accused him of 'continuing to incite racial hatred against Muslims'. The 30-year-old, who was also a BNP member, founded the EDL in 2009 because he was angry that Muslims demonstrated as British troops returned from Afghanistan. He has convictions for assault, drug and public order offences but has pledged to help tackle racism in Britain since he left the far right party. It is the third attempt by the Union to get Mr Robinson to address students after his first scheduled appearance was cancelled due to security concerns. His second attempt to speak had to be cancelled after he was sent back to prison after being convicted of mortgage fraud in January. But an open letter signed by more than 200 people, including film director Ken Loach, has called for his invitation to be cancelled. The letter by Oxford Unite Against Facisim states: 'By inviting Tommy Robinson the Oxford Union is contributing to a climate of Islamophobia which only encourages fascists onto the streets of Oxford. 'The Oxford Union should not be giving racists and Islamophobes the prestige of speaking at their institution and we demand Robinson's invitation is withdrawn.' The organisation are also planning to demonstrate outside the Union from 7pm. Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, left the EDL in October last year, and has received numerous death threats. A convicted football hooligan, he was also arrested in May 2012, after allegedly obstructing police as he tried to get close to the spot in Woolwich where Lee Rigby was murdered. It is the third attempt by the Union to get Mr Robinson to speak after his first two scheduled appearances had to be cancelled . Mr Robinson confirmed on Twitter that he would be addressing the Union at 8pm tonight and admitted he was a 'little nervous' He also confirmed that the subject of his speech would be the EDL, why it formed and its history . He also claimed 'every single Muslim' was to blame for 'getting away' with the July 7 bombings. Since he left the EDL he has said that his past inflammatory statements had often been fuelled by alcohol and the adrenaline rush of 'leading the biggest street protest movement in Europe.' Giving reason for his decision to leave the group, Mr Robinson said he had been sobered by his 18-week stint in prison and by the experience of being shunned by parents when picking up his children at school. An open letter has been signed by more than 200 people, including film director Ken Loach, calling for his invitation to the Oxford Union, pictured, be cancelled . He said that he was sorry for creating an 'us and them' culture and for causing fear among British Muslims. Writing on his Twitter page today, he confirmed he would be appearing at the Oxford Union later this evening saying he was hoping his speech goes ok and that he was a 'little nervous.' He also added that he plans to talk about the EDL and why he formed it and its history, although he added he was not allowed to talk about certain issues due to him being out of prison on licence. The Oxford Union confirmed that Mr Robinson would be speaking tonight but refused to comment further. Nick Griffin, who addressed the Oxford Union in 2007. Students demonstrated outside the building when the former BNP leader was invited to speak . In 2007, students demonstrated outside the Oxford Union after then BNP leader Nick Griffin and controversial historian David Irving, a holocaust denier were allowed to address students. More than 300 protesters gathered at the gates of the Union chanting slogans waving banners. During the debate, anti fascist campaigners successfully disrupted the proceedings by crashing into the meeting hall and staging a sit-in. The breach delayed the speeches and split the meeting into two. But the speakers were each allowed to address separate audiences after the hall was cleared by police. In 1996 the Union also sparked controversy after OJ Simpson gave his only UK appearance to the Union after being cleared of murdering his wife. Meanwhile the Union has also sparked controversy for inviting certain celebrities to address students such as pop stars the Cheeky Girls and glamour model Jodie Marsh. In 2011, Katie Price, formerly known as Jordan, addressed the union where she told the spectators who she believes there needs to be tighter regulations on the media. Other unlikely debaters have also included club owner Peter Stringfellow, TV presenter Keith Chegwin and reality TV show star David Gest.","Tommy Robinson, former EDL leader is to speak to students tonight .

"It's been a bad year for tourism in Thailand, and at first glance it looked like a new YouTube video was adding to the misery. The video called 'I Hate Thailand' drew more than one million views within days of being posted. But it was revealed the clip - which features an angry British tourist on a beach - was produced by Thailand's tourism authority, using a strategy of reverse psychology to attract tourists. Viral: The I Hate Thailand footage shows James eventually falling in love with the country . It comes after the country's image was battered by a military coup in May and the brutal murders of two British tourists on an idyllic beach on the island of Koh Tao in September. The five-minute video shows James revealing how his bag was stolen: 'I hate this place. I hate Thailand,' he tells a handheld camera. After mouthing off to a policeman, he meets an attractive Thai woman and eventually finds reasons to like Thailand. Reasons to like Thailand... in the footage, James meets and falls for a Thai woman . In the end, the unshaven, bare-chested foreigner cleans up, puts on clothes, befriends the locals and gets his bag back - wallet, passport and all. Several Thai newspapers reported the video as a real news item last week, prompting the Tourism Authority of Thailand to issue a press release on Monday saying it was behind what it called the 'romantic-comedy short film'. 'There's been much hype and speculation following the release of the I Hate Thailand video,' TAT Governor Thawatchai Arunyik is quoted as saying. Idyllic: Thailand is expecting to record a drop in  number of tourists this year due to the country's poor image . 'The intention of this video is solely to depict the renowned Thai hospitality.' The tourism authority said it was inspired by research showing that 'unbranded' advertisements tend to receive more interest than conventional commercials. The video, which bears no indication of being funded by the Thai government, was posted on a YouTube account that also gave no clue of ties to officialdom. The strategy is part of a massive campaign to restore Thailand's battered image overseas and revive tourism, which accounts for about seven per cent of the economy. The tourism authority has forecast that tourist arrivals for 2014 will drop for the first time in years, after a record year in 2013 when 26.7 million visitors came to Thailand.","Video shows 'James', who has lost his bag containing wallet and passport .

"A filmmaker has shared fascinating aerial footage of houses and cars blanketed by deep snow at the height of a fierce storm that paralysed the Buffalo region for days. Using a GoPro camera attached to a radio-controlled drone, James Grimaldi got a bird’s eye view of the winter wonderland as snow fell at a rate of four inches per hour in the New York suburb of West Seneca. By the time it was over the devastating storm dumped a year’s worth of  snow in two days, with as much as seven feet accumulating in some neighbourhoods. Winter wonderland: James Grimaldi got a bird's eye view of the fierce storm in his Buffalo suburb . The white stuff: The devastating storm dumped a year’s worth of snow in two days . Mr Grimaldi’s video begins as his garage door opens to reveal a wall of snow that is already several feet high. In swirling snow, the drone flies high above his neighbourhood, where everything is buried in a sea of white. Amazing footage: The streets in West Seneca were deserted when the drone was unleashed in swirling snow . Sea of white: The storm trapped people in their homes or cars and stranded some at work . Parked cars are barely visible, rooftops are blanketed, tree branches are buckling under the weight of snow and streets are deserted. Mr Grimaldi filmed several videos during and after the storm, which trapped people in their homes or cars and stranded some at work or wherever they could find refuge, including coffee shops. It was responsible for 13 deaths and dozens of accidents, and it forced officials to close schools and move an NFL game from Buffalo’s snow-packed outdoor stadium to an indoor venue in Detroit.","James Grimaldi filmed the winter wonderland in his Buffalo suburb .

"Every youngster loves to play in the mud, and it’s no different for these rascally lion cubs. But they’re going to give their mum an extra headache, because three of the four new siblings are ultra-rare white lions... and getting the dirt out of their creamy fur is going to require a lot of licking. These extraordinary pictures are the first-ever photographs of new-born white lions in the wild. They are found in just one place on Earth, the Greater Timbavati region in South Africa, where just 13 remain — and that total includes these cubs. It’s serious work, being so young, so rare and so cute. But these boisterous characters have got their paws full exploring and practising their play-fighting. So while the older members of the pride keep a watch for danger, the cubs have fun. Scroll down for video . A mother rubs heads with her cub. These extraordinary photographs are the first-ever pictures of new-born white lions in the wild . The three cubs lie dozing in the dirt while their mother keeps watch for any sign of danger . The three snow-white cubs owe their unusual colour to a rare genetic marker that results in a white pelt but pigmented eyes, skin and paws . The new arrivals are part of a pride with six adults, including two fully grown white lionesses. Cape Town photographer Scott Ramsay, 39, who took these pictures, was able to identify the cubs’ mother: ‘She has piercing blue eyes,’ he said, ‘and together with her white coat, she was supremely photogenic.’ But it is not known which male is the father because the cubs are not albinos but owe their remarkable colouring to a genetic twist, which many Timbavati lions carry. The leucism pigment gene gives them blue or green-grey eyes instead of brown, and a pelt that remains white all their lives. Just like a human family trait, the recessive gene can lie dormant for generations and then reappear — so any of the tawny males could have fathered these cubs. It is even possible for two brown adults to have a litter of white cubs — but only if they are Timbavati lions. The indigenous Shangaan tribe has known about the white lions for centuries, and their medicine men traditionally believe them to be animal angels. One legend says they were the first creatures to be created by the gods — and when life becomes extinct the roar of the white lions will be the last sound on Earth. One of the white lion cubs play fights with a tawny cub. The three white cubs are part of a pride of six adults, including two fully grown white lionesses . These are the first ever pictures of white lion cubs born to a white lioness in the wild. Pictured is a white cub play fighting with a relative . The birth of the extremely rare cubs has been celebrated by conservation groups that include the Global White Lion Protection Trust . Left, the mother of the white lion cubs is pictured yawning, and right, she bares her teeth in an ominous sign . A group of cubs, two of which are white and the other a traditional tawny colour, wander out of the bush together . Europeans first discovered them in 1938, though they were not well known until the Seventies, when naturalist Chris McBride published two books. Although the white mutation probably evolved many millennia ago, some conservationists feared white lions could not survive in the wild: their colouring would make it impossible to remain camouflaged while hunting. Consequently, almost all of the white lions were rounded up and sold to zoos, if they were not killed by big game hunters first. Yet these pictures prove white lions can thrive in the wild. Tragically, these beautiful creatures do face a deadly threat because of the colour of their pelts — and it comes from man. Hunters pay grotesque sums to slaughter lions, even though it is illegal to hunt them almost everywhere in Africa. White lions are especially prized. In South Africa, a particularly vile practice has emerged, known as canned hunting: lions are captured in the wild as cubs, or bred in captivity, and brought up as tourist attractions. A white lioness and her cub nuzzle each other in a heartwarming display of affection . The majority of the pride rest in this picture taken in the early morning, while one of the white cubs gets up early seeking attention . The three cubs wander around the sleeping pride in the early morning. Only thirteen white lions exist in the Greater Timbavati Region in South Africa . They are bottle-fed, taught not to fear humans, and spend their days being petted and photographed by unwitting visitors. But when the cubs grow too big to enchant the tourists, they are put into a small enclosure — to be shot by some foreign ‘hunter’ who wants to hang a lion’s head on his wall and brag that he killed it. One American recently handed over $165,000, or £105,000, to kill a ‘canned’ lion. For all these grim warnings, the discovery of the cubs is still reason for rejoicing. ‘The birth of these second generation white cubs to a wild white lioness is fantastic news,’ says conservationist Linda Tucker, who has reintroduced seven captive white lions into Timbavati, and who founded the Global White Lion Protection Trust to campaign for their survival. It brings huge hope for the future of white lions.’ The former model, who fell in love with the animals during a safari in 1991, takes a mystical view of the white lions: ‘They are South Africa’s pride and joy, our living national treasure. The Shangaan believe they are sacred animals, and frankly I support the Shangaan on that.’ Sacred or not, that fur is going to need a lot of work before mum is satisfied it’s clean again.","These incredible pictures are the first-ever photographs of new-born white lions in the wild, of which just 13 remain .
White lions are found in just one place on Earth - the Greater Timbavati Region in South Africa .
The new baby cubs are part of a pride that includes six adults, including two fully grown white lionesses .
It's not known which male is the father because the cubs are not albinos but owe their colouring to a genetic twist ."
"More than one firearm has gone missing every month from the Ministry of Defence  since the Coalition was formed in May 2010, figures reveal. Overall, some 56 weapons have been lost or stolen over the past four years, the Government admitted following a Freedom of Information request. Labour has demanded a ‘full investigation’ into how the deadly weapons were lost amid heightened fears over terror attacks on British soldiers following last year’s tragic Lee Rigby killing. Scroll down for video . Fears have been raised that Minister of Defence weapons are finding their way into the hands of gangsters and criminals . In the 10 months to the end of October this year eight firearms were lost or stolen from the Minister of Defence. The year before, 18 were taken, down from 21 in 2012. In 2011, meanwhile, just nine went missing. The figures were released after a freedom of information request asking the Government to include the number of tasers, pistols and fully-automatic rifles which were unaccounted for. It comes after figures released earlier this year revealed military bullets were being used by gangsters in British cities. Almost 2,000 bullets were lost or stolen from the Ministry of Defence last year. Documents revealed British military ammunition was responsible for 46 per cent of the bullets discharged in the Merseyside area between April and October 2012. Shadow defence secretary said the security breach had to be taken 'extremely seriously' In December 2007, the Ministry of Defence revealed the gun used to shoot WPC Rachael Bown, 24, in the stomach in Nottingham in 2006 had been stolen from the Army. The Browning 9mm pistol used in the attack had been stolen from a British military base or smuggled by troops from Afghanistan or Iraq and sold to thugs by a soldier. Vernon Coaker, Labour’s Shadow Defence Secretary, attacked the lax security allowing guns and bullets onto the streets. He said: ‘At a time when our servicemen and women are under threat from terrorism, the theft or loss of even one firearm from the Armed Forces within the UK must be taken extremely seriously. ‘The public needs to have confidence that every effort is being made to prevent these security breaches. 'But the government is refusing to provide any details about how, where and when these guns went missing. ‘We need to be sure that there has been a full investigation in to each incident and that lessons have been learned to prevent this sort of thing occurring in the future.’ An MOD spokesperson said: 'We take the security of firearms and ammunition very seriously and have robust procedures to deter and prevent losses and thefts. 'Given the dynamic nature of military training and, in particular, deployed operations it is impossible to prevent all losses but every instance is fully and rigorously investigated working alongside the civilian police where appropriate.'","EXCLUSIVE: 56 firearms have been lost or stolen over the past four years .

"One of the most ornate pieces of hand-beaten copperwork ever to be made in Britain  is poised to add the finishing touch to a new lecture theatre in a huge £19million development at the exclusive Eton College. The enormous  267lb roof ornament, which has taken eight months to make, will sit atop a gable outside the 300-seat hall at the prestigious £34,000-per-year school. The elaborate feature, known as an acroterion, has been made by Michael Johnson and Shelley Anderson and is said to be the most complex example of copperwork made 'in a generation'. One of the most ornate piece of hand-beaten copperwork ever to be made in Britain will be installed on top of a lecture theatre in a huge £19million development at Eton College . The enormous 267lb roof ornament, which has been eight months in the making, will sit atop a gable inside the £33,000-per-year college . The elaborate feature, known as an acroterion, has been made by coppersmiths Michael Johnson (left) and Shelley Anderson (right) The pair now have the challenging task of installing the six feet wide sculpture - which they said would cost between £50,000 and £70,000 to make - outside the school's new lecture hall. Mr Johnson said it was one of the most intricate pieces of copper to be made in decades and that hand-crafted work of this sort has not been done since the Second World War. He said: 'It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the most complex and intricate pieces of hand-crafted architectural copper-work made in this country in a generation.' The two men, who run the Copper Works studio in Newlyn, Cornwall, were commissioned to make the roof decoration by architects working for Eton's new quadrangle-style development, Bekynton Field. The £19m project - which has been worked on by the architect John Simpson, who also designed the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace - includes 40 new classrooms for modern languages, economics and politics, as well as the lecture theatre and exhibition space. It is the latest addition to the sprawling site in Windsor, Berkshire, which is best known for its Gothic-style college chapel that was part of the original design when it was founded in 1441. The pair now have the challenging task of installing the six-feet wide sculpture - which they said would cost between £50,000 and £70,000 to make - outside the school's new lecture hall . Mr Johnson (pictured) said it was one of the most intricate pieces of copper to be made in decades and that hand-crafted work of this sort has not been carried out since the Second World War . The pair said there were a lot of engineering challenges to overcome in making the huge feature, including how it should be hung . The pair had to design a strong but light stainless steel roof structure so the feature can be attached in the correct position . The new complex is said to have been designed to blend in with the historic environment and will feature conservation-grade brickwork as well as stonework features and brick arches. Mr Johnson said: 'There were a lot of engineering challenges to overcome because it was an exercise in balancing the aesthetic and the practical. There were numerous considerations, such as ensuring it was able to expand and contract in the heat and also drain properly. 'Then there were issues with how it was to be fixed. Traditionally a piece like this would have been done over wood, but there was no provision in the roof structure to bolt it to the roof so we had to design and build a stainless steel armature which was relatively light and able to flex. 'With something as complex as this you have to design it with close consideration to how it will function. And all the planning has to be done before a single hammer is swung.' Acroterions are a hallmark of Britain's grandest buildings and can include discs, tripods and ornate Gothic statues. Only a handful are still made in the UK and very few are as large as the pair's creation. A new £19million development is currently being built at Eton College (pictured) which will include the lecture theatre and 40 new classrooms . One of the most well-known parts of the school includes the Eton College chapel, which was part of the original plan for the school when it was founded by King Henry VI in 1441 . Acroterions are typically placed on a flat base called the acroter or plinth and mounted at the apex of the pediment of a building in the classical style. The names derives from the Greek words for extremity and endmost. Mr Johnson told the Western Morning News they won the contract after being contact by the project's architects, Simpsons. He said: 'They had searched the whole of the UK to find someone capable of producing something like this – and they initially drew a blank and went to France. 'As a society, we acknowledge the historical importance of our buildings, but there remains a gap between that and the people needed to keep them going. 'The sort of thing we have made for Eton stopped happening in Britain after the Second World War. Intricate hand-crafted copper-work doesn’t really get done in this country any more... well it didn’t until we started on the acroterion.' Although the pair would not say how much they are being paid, they said a project like that would cost between £50,000 and £70,000 to commission. The £19m Bekynton Field development - which has been worked on by architect John Simpson, who also designed the Queens Gallery at Buckingham Palace - includes 40 new classrooms for modern languages, economics and politics, as well as the lecture theatre and exhibition space. The new complex is said to have been designed to blend in with the historic environment at the school in Windsor, Berkshire, and will feature conservation-grade brickwork as well as stonework features and brick arches. The school chapel, one of the most picturesque and well-known parts of the site, formed part of the original plan for the site when the school was founded by King Henry VI as free education to 70 Cambridge-bound boys in 1441. He intended the nave of the chapel - which was to include 18 bays - to be the longest in Europe. The new complex is said to have been designed to blend in with the historic environment at the school in Windsor, Berkshire (pictured) and will feature conservation-grade brickwork as well as stonework features and brick arches . But when Henry was deposed by King Edward IV in 1461, construction of the chapel stopped. It was then gradually put together during the remainder of the century. The important wall paintings in the Gothic-style chapel and some of the buildings in the school yard also date back to that time. The lower storeys of the cloister, including College Hall, was built between 1441 and 1460 . The school then plunged into final difficulty meaning most of the building work was not resumed until Roger Lupton was Provost, around 1517. His name is borne by the big gate-house in the cloisters at the front of the school yard, perhaps the most famous image of the school. This range includes the parlour, election hall and election chamber, where most of the 18th century 'leaving portraits' are kept. Nothing else of significance was built until about 1670, when the school yard was remodelled and completed by Matthew Bankes. The last important addition to the central college buildings was the College Library, in the south range of the cloister in 1725, by Thomas Rowland. In the 19th century, the architect John Shaw Jr became surveyor to Eton. He designed buildings in 1844 which were to be used as better accommodation. The very large and ornate school hall and school library were erected by L.K Hall in 1906 as the school's memorial to the Etonians who had died in the Boer War. During the Second World War, a bomb destroyed part of Upper School and blew out many windows in the Chapel. The college commissioned replacements by Evie Hone, John Piper and Patrick Reyntiens from 1959. In 1959, the school also constructed a nuclear bunker to house the College's Provost and fellows which is now used for storage. The completion of the Bekynton Field development will be followed by a series more development at the college, including the renovation of the boarding house, which will include 53 mostly en-suite study bedrooms.","The enormous 267lb roof ornament, known as an acroterion, has taken coppersmiths eight months to make .

"Jesse 'LJ' Matthew, the man charged with the abduction of missing UVA student Hannah Graham, was accused of rape when he studied at  Liberty University, MailOnline can exclusively reveal. Matthew was expelled from the Christian university founded by Jerry Falwell in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 2002, following the alleged sex attack on a female student but was not charged with any crime, former teammates said. Police announced last night that Matthew was arrested in Galveston, Texas, after going on the run. He appeared in court there this morning charged with Hannah's abduction 'with intent to defile' and is awaiting extradition to Virginia. As a gifted football player, 'LJ' - as he likes to be known - won a sports scholarship to Liberty University after he was named Charlottesville's 'Athlete of the Year' in 1999. Scroll down for video . Rough: Teammates claimed that the girl was taken to hospital after he was 'aggressive' with her at party. Matthew pictured left in 2002 Liberty University team and right, before he grew his dreadlocks . Caught: Matthew was the last known person to see Hannah Graham before she disappeared on September 12. He was arrested in Texas (mugshot above) on charges of Hannah's abduction with intent to defile after going on the lam . In chains: Matthew appears in court in Galveston as preparations are made to extradite him to Virginia . Desperate: Hannah was drunk when she was seen wandering around Charlottesville in the early hours of the morning. Her distraught parents have said that they fear she may have been a victim of 'foul play' But Matthew, now 32, was forced to leave before he graduated following the allegation that he raped a female student on the university campus in October 2002. Lynchburg City Police investigated the rape allegation and Matthew was named as a suspect, MailOnline has been told. But the student was not arrested or charged, due to lack of evidence. However his scholarship was withdrawn and he was thrown out of the university, his teammates told MailOnline. Former Liberty Flames Football captain William Haith said: 'LJ was on the football team. He was a defensive end. He won a sports scholarship for football. 'But he left in 2002. He got into some trouble over sex with a girl. She made a complaint against him. He was put out of the football team because of the complaint. He was kicked out of the university as well. 'The allegation was that he forced himself upon a girl at a party and had sex with her. The girl said he was aggressive towards her and she filed a complaint against him. He was put off the football team and he was put out of school. Liberty is a very disciplined school with strong religious beliefs.' Another former teammate, Milton Johnson, claimed: 'LJ was accused of sexual assaulting a girl when he was at Liberty. She was a student at Liberty. He got kicked off the football team and kicked out of the university. He was real rough with her and she ended up in hospital.' Mr Milton added: 'LJ was awkward around people. He was kind of weird.' A third former teammate, Andre Jerry, told MailOnline: 'I know LJ. He played on the defensive line – we were a pretty tight crew. I remember a girl did make an allegation against him but I don't know the details. She was a student at Liberty. But LJ was never charged with anything.' Jesse Matthew, 32, pictured in handcuffs, was arrested on Wednesday afternoon on a Texas beach and escorted by sheriff deputies into Galveston County jail (left). He was caught on surveillance video earlier at a gas station in Galveston, right . Job-hopping: After his fall from grace at Liberty, Matthew worked various jobs including driving a taxi until he ended up working as a hospital porter at UVA . A spokesman for Lynchburg City Police did not confirm the claim, citing procedure, but told MailOnline: 'It was an allegation of rape. A suspect was identified. But there was not enough evidence to move forward against that person.' He added: 'We are co-operating with the Charlottesville Police Department. They have contacted us and we are assisting them as best we can with any questions they have.' Captain Gary Pleasants, a lead investigator in the disappearance of Hannah Graham, told MailOnline: 'We are looking into a number of historical allegations against Matthew.' Liberty is America's largest private non-profit university and is also the largest Evangelical Christian university in the world with almost 14,000 residential students and over 100,000 online students. Founded as Lynchburg Baptist College in 1971, Liberty describes itself as a Christian academic community. It is as renowned for its high academic and sporting ability as its strong moral and spiritual beliefs. Students are held to a strict code of conduct, known as The Liberty Way. Liberty's athletic teams compete in Division 1 NCAA sports and are collectively known as the Liberty Flames. 'LJ was kicked out of Liberty after he was accused of sexual assault,' a source with knowledge of Matthew's background told MailOnline. 'He won a football scholarship to go there. He was real good at football. 'He played for Liberty as a defensive lineman. But he left under a cloud. He has always been resentful of that.' Liberty University has confirmed Matthew studied there but declined to give further details. A spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'Liberty University had a student by the name of Jesse Leroy Matthew enrolled from 2000 to 2002. This student was on the football team roster during the 2000, 2001 and 2002 seasons. Federal student record privacy laws (FERPA) prevent Liberty University from providing further responses to your inquiries.' Angered: A source told MailOnline: 'He played for Liberty as a defensive lineman. But he left under a cloud. He has always been resentful of that' Talented: Matthew was described as a talented football player at Liberty University before he was expelled under a cloud. He won a scholarship there after being named Charlottesville's 'Athlete of the Year' in 1999 . Mystery man: Police released this footage in their search for a man in dreadlocks. He was revealed to be Jesse 'LJ' Matthew, a nursing assistant at UVA Hospital by MailOnline on Saturday . Confusion: This map shows Hannah Graham's movements on the night of Friday 12 and Saturday 13. At 11.50pm she was seen at a party by friends with another male friend. She then seemed to head westward toward the Charlottesville downtown mall . Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo has said he believes Matthew was the 'last person to see Hannah Graham before she vanished off the face of the face of the earth'. On Monday night the 32-year-old from Charlottesville was charged with 'abduction with intent to defile' 18-year-old student Hannah Graham from Alexandria. After a hunt involving the FBI, he was arrested on a beach in Galveston, Texas, on Wednesday and will be brought back to Virginia. He was also wanted on two counts of reckless driving after he presented himself to police on Saturday, but then he sped off. It also emerged today that in 2009 Matthew was charged with a felony for attempted grand larceny, misdemeanor assault and trespassing, after he was accused of assaulting someone while trying to steal a cell phone. The charges were eventually dropped. He also has a long list of minor driving offenses to his name. Matthew grew up in Charlottesville living with his mother and younger sister Nicky. He was often looked after by his grandmother Christine Carr, while his mother Debra worked. He attended the Red Hill Elementary School just outside the city in Albemarle County. Later he studied at Monticello High School and graduated in his senior year when he was 18. After his dreams of becoming a professional football player were left in tatters he has had a number of different jobs. In 2007 he started working for the Yellow Cab taxi company based in Charlottesville. No comment: Charlottesville Police Capt Gary Pleasants refused to comment on the importance of the clothing recovered in the second search. Investigators seen above entering the house on Monday . Hunt: A deputy sheriff sits outside the home of Matthew's mother. Police had been hunting him since Saturday . Later he got a job working in the Transportation Department of UVA Hospital. In recent months he assumed the role of hospital porter, taking patients into the operations room. However Matthew has continued to be involved in sport. He is an assistant coach for the Covenant School varsity football team, a private Christian school in Charlottesville. Matthew is understood have directed a game from the side line on Friday September 12, the night Hannah Graham went missing. Matthew was seen leaving the Tempo bar close to Charlottesville's Downtown Mall with Hannah Graham at about 1.20am last Saturday morning. He has been identified as the dreadlocked man seen following The 18-year-old on video footage released by investigators. On Tuesday, authorities announced that they had taken clothing in another search of the 32-year-old nursing-assistant's home. However, Charlottesville Police Captain Gary Pleasants declined to comment on the importance of the clothing items or give any further details on what prompted the second search. Police have not yet revealed what prompted the charges being brought on Tuesday, a week after they first searched his apartment and let him go. According to Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo, Matthew walked into the police station with two relatives on Saturday but quickly left the station after asking to speak to a lawyer. Chief Longo says the FBI and Virginia State Police are helping Charlottesville Police in the hunt for Matthew, who is 6'2' and 270lb. Hannah's parents, John and Sue, spoke publicly on Sunday for the first time since their 18-year-old daughter's disappearance last week. Heartbreak: John and Sue Graham address the press on Sunday for the first time. They set out how precious Hannah was to all her family and pleaded for anyone with information to come forward . Fugitive: Police issued a new wanted poster for Jesse Matthew on Tuesday night after charges were filed . Speaking in a British accent Mr Graham said: 'As this nightmare for Hannah, for us, for Hannah's big brother James, her grandparents and extended family continues we would like to make this statement. 'Hannah is our little girl, our only daughter, James's little sister. She is also the oldest granddaughter of her grandparents. She is enormously precious to us.' A $100,000 reward has been posted for information relating to her disappearance.

"Hassam Khan, 24, had his front teeth broken after an NYPD cop smashed his face into the roof of a car during a traffic stop last year in Staten Island . A 24-year-old is suing the New York Police Department after a cop allegedly smashed his face into a car roof leaving pieces of his front teeth stuck in the metal. Hassam Khan was driving home in his cousin's new Mercedes on December 26 last year, when the pair were pulled over by an unmarked police car in Staten Island. The cops pulled the men over because they may have been speeding, Mr Khan's lawyer told MailOnline on Wednesday. The officers then illegally searched the car but didn't find any drugs or contraband items that they appeared to be looking for, lawyer Harvey Greenberg said. It was then, according to Mr Greenberg, that the cops became 'upset' and slammed his client's face into the roof of the car. The violence of the move caused portions of the 24-year-old's front teeth to snap off and become embedded in the metal. The alleged assault occurred in front of Mr Khan's family home in Graniteville. He was left in 'excruciating pain' following the incident and had to have the broken parts of his front teeth pulled out and replaced with implants. The procedure cost Mr Khan, who does not have insurance, $1,500. Mr Khan, a graduate student who is working for his father's business, was charged with reckless driving, resisting arrest and obstructing government administration. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after being advised by a lawyer who is a friend of the family. Parts of the 24-year-old graduate's front teeth were left embedded in the metal on the car roof. He is now suing the NYPD in a civil lawsuit filed on Monday . The teeth marks left by Mr Khan on the car after he claims he was slammed into the roof by an NYPD cop . Mr Greenberg said that a civil lawsuit had been filed in Brooklyn Federal Court on Monday. The suit alleges that Officer Mark Scarlatelli was the cop who used excessive force and slammed Mr Khan's head into the car and accused him of being drunk. According to the Daily News, the three cops involved could be facing disciplinary action. The Civilian Complaint Review Board examined the officers' actions and substantiated Khan’s allegations against Scarlatelli along with agreeing that an improper search of the car had taken place by Detective Steven Marshall. Officer John Ryan was cited for not telling NYPD Internal Affairs  about the injuries suffered by the suspect, Mr Greenberg said. A city official confirmed to MailOnline on Wednesday that the Civilian Complaint Review Board looked into Mr Khan's claims .","Hassam Khan, 24, was driving home in his cousin's new Mercedes on December 26 last year when he was pulled over by an unmarked car .

"A mother is campaigning for a ban on selling laxatives to children after her anorexic teenage daughter bought hundreds in order to lose weight. Carolyn Jones, 45, was horrified when her 16-year-old daughter Sarah collapsed after taking an entire packet of laxatives and had to be rushed to hospital. The mother-of-five then discovered 150 packets of the pills which Sarah had hidden throughout the family home in Liverpool. Campain: Carolyn Jones, 45, (left) is campaigning for a ban on selling laxatives to children after her anorexic teenage daughter Sarah (right) bought hundreds in order to lose weight . After learning how easy it had been for her daughter to buy the laxatives without any questions asked, Mrs Jones launched her campaign for restrictions on the sale of the drugs, raising the age at which they can be purchased and the number which can be sold in one go. 'We found hundreds of packets stashed all over. Anyone of any age can buy as many as they like at any one stage,' she said. 'Sarah was going into the local Tesco in her school uniform and buying packets and packets of laxatives without anyone asking any questions... but then they don’t have to.' Mrs Jones, a pensions administrator, wants laws governing the sale of laxatives to be introduced, bringing them in line with general sales list medicines such as paracetamol, which can only be bought in packs of 16 tablets in shops - although selling them to children is at the discretion of the retailer. 'It is really quite simple. I want them taken off the shelves or treated in the same way as paracetamol,' she said. Cause: Mrs Jones wants restrictions to be placed on the sale of laxatives, raising the age at which they can be purchased and the number which can be sold in one go . 'I know it won’t stop people getting hold of them - like painkilling tablets, you could simply go to shop after shop - but it would make it more difficult.' Sarah, 16, has struggled with anorexia for the last two years. The illness came to light after she started to have panic attacks around October 2012. Mrs Jones took her to their doctor who referred her to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services or CAMHS. 'Sarah took laxatives and was constantly exercising. She would say she was going into town and would walk there and walk back, anything to try to help her lose weight,' Mrs Jones said. 'We became aware of the laxatives when she collapsed twice, the second time at home, and it turned out she had taken a whole packet of laxatives - all 28. 'She was rushed to A&E and then taken to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital. Obviously anyone who took 28 laxatives would have stomach cramps and be unwell but when you are already anorexic and dehydrated, it has a more drastic effect. Teenager: Sarah before she became ill with anorexia. Her mother says they are still fighting her eating disorder as a family but 'are getting their' 'We came back home and found more than 150 packets, hidden around the house. At one point we know Sarah bought six packets at once.' Mrs Jones, who has five children aged between 11 and 22, says Sarah was suffering from depression, the root cause of which has now been identified so that she, her family and the mental health professionals can finally help her to deal with it. 'Being a teenage girl is difficult enough,' said Mrs Jones. 'It took over everyone’s lives in the family and we are still fighting against it, but we are getting there. 'It isn’t just people with eating disorders this affects. 'Young girls will eat what they want because they just think they can take laxatives afterwards to control their weight. What they don’t realise is that, eventually, it messes up their system. 'I get annoyed too when I look at social media. You see WAGs and celebrities who talk about how much they’ve eaten, how ""fat"" they are and how they are going to have to train so hard now.... and they’re not fat, they’re thin. 'Young girls are looking up to these people and they need to be aware of who they are influencing. 'For those with an eating disorder it is more important still that we are all aware. It’s a horrific illness - and it isn’t helped by the ease with which people can get laxatives.' Mrs Jones has already appeared on BBC’s Watchdog programme - after which the MHRA, The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which governs the control of such medication, changed the warnings on the packets. However, Mrs Jones says this needs to go further. 'I’m not so naive to think more action will stop young girls getting hold of laxatives but it will make it more difficult,' said Mrs Jones, who has set up a Twitter account @laxoffshelves to help raise awareness of her campaign. 'I want to keep awareness going and the pressure on to try to stop other young girls being able to do what Sarah did. 'As a mum I know the devastation it can cause them and those around them.' The sale of drugs is policed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which said it has no plans to restrict laxative sales but it will put stronger warnings on packets. Medication: The sale of drugs is policed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which said it has no plans to restrict laxative sales but it will put stronger warnings on packets . A MHRA spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Most laxative medicines are used by patients safely and in accordance with the instructions for use on the patient information leaflet (PIL), however we do recognise that some patients misuse or abuse them. 'Our Patient and Public Engagement Expert Advisory Group (EAG) which reports to the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) has recently reviewed the patient information for non-prescription laxatives and has recommended that stronger warnings should be added emphasising that taking laxatives regularly for a long time is harmful and they do not aid weight loss. 'We are currently working with companies of stimulant laxative products to introduce these updated warnings which should provide consistency across the range of stimulant laxative products available.' The Watchdog episode featuring Mrs Jones was made with the help of charity Beat, which provides help and support for people with eating disorders. Like Mrs Jones, the charity is also calling for restrictions on the sale of laxatives, including a minimum purchase age of 16, a maximum pack size with a suggestion of no more than ten, sales restricted to pharmacies and not sold in general retail outlets and packs not displayed in self service areas but kept behind the sales counter. 'Beat’s campaign featured on the Watchdog programme had several calls to action which we will continue to pursue,' said a charity spokesman. 'Although we were pleased to hear that the MHRA changed the warnings on the pack there is still much more to be done in order to protect those for whom laxative intake can be so dangerous.' She added: 'Like Carolyn, Beat is determined to see more changes brought about and asks that the industry takes greater responsibility by listening to the concerns of the many thousands of people affected and act accordingly.' Laxatives are widely used to treat constipation and are available without a prescription from pharmacies and supermarkets. However, taking laxatives for weight loss, or in an attempt to cleanse the body, can lead to serious long-term health problems. 'Many people with bulimia and anorexia find themselves overusing laxatives in order to control their weight or calorie intake,' advises the charity Beat, which offers support to those with eating disorders, and gives suggestions to those who want to stop using laxatives. 'Taking more than the recommended dose, or regularly taking laxatives over a period of weeks, months or even years can lead to serious health problems. 'It is important to know that laxatives do not prevent food and calories from being absorbed by the body, since they work on the lower bowel after the point at which food is digested. Laxatives can lead to temporary weight loss by causing dehydration. They can also prevent valuable vitamins and minerals from being fully absorbed, and affect the healthy working of the bowel.' Users will lose mostly water and very little fat, with frequent use often leading to dehydration and long-term bowel damage. Excessive or prolonged use of laxatives can also cause intestinal obstruction (where the bowel becomes blocked by large, dry stools) and unbalanced levels of salts and minerals in your body. Side effects of taking laxatives include: Stomach cramps, chronic diarrhoea, bloating, nausea, water retention, vomiting, dehydration, weakening and softening of bones, rectal bleeding and electrolyte disorder - which can ultimately lead to an abnormal heart rhythm which can cause cardiac failure and death. Constant users can also experience chronic constipation and pain, and can be left unable to have bowel movements without the help of laxatives. Overdosing can also lead to gastrointestinal tract damage. Laxatives should only be taken as per instructions and medical help should be immediately sought of a user experiences bloody bowel movements, rectal bleeding, severe abdominal cramps, dizziness, weakness or unusual fatigue. Among its suggestions on giving up laxatives, Beat advises users give up completely if they only take small amounts, or cut down gradually. It also recommends increasing the amount of fibre in a diet and seek support from a friend or relative, or a professional such as GP or counsellor. The charity also offers support groups and helplines for those seeking help.","Carolyn Jones's daughter Sarah was hospitalised after taking 28 laxatives .

"An Alzheimer's sufferer was locked into his onesie by his partner to stop him unzipping the garment . An Alzheimer's sufferer was locked into his onesie by his partner to stop him shredding and eating his incontinence pads, a court has heard. The woman, in her 50s, allegedly 'fashioned' the all-in-one suit so a padlock could be used to stop the man unzipping the garment for a number of weeks. The court was told the man, who is in his 80s, had a habit of pulling apart the incontinence pads before eating them at their half-a-million-pound home in Surrey. When asked by an official about why she had used the lock, the woman said she had dressed him in the onesie 'on medical advice', court was told. Judge Lush said the incident was almost identical to another case in which the judge ruled there had not been any deprivation of the person's liberty. He subsequently ruled that this incident also did not amount to a deprivation of the man's liberty. The man, who used to work on the London Underground, had been diagnosed with the illness in 2009, the court was told. Details emerged in a ruling by the judge after a hearing in London at the Court of Protection, where issues relating to sick and vulnerable people are analysed. Judge Lush had been asked to analyse a legal issue relating to the man's son, who had been given authority to manage his father's financial affairs. An official from the Office of the Public Guardian - which protects and helps people who do not have the mental capacity to make decisions - told the judge about the onesie. She said the approach adopted by the woman - a mother of three - was 'certainly unusual' and had been a 'cause of concern for local authority services'. Martina Kane, senior policy officer at Alzheimer’s Society, said new behaviour caused by the condition can be difficult for people to deal with. She said: ‘Dementia can affect people in very different ways. Judge Lush at the Court of Protection (pictured) said the case was not a deprivation of the man's liberty . 'As the condition develops, it can cause behaviour changes that can be confusing or difficult for others to deal with leaving carers feeling stressed or helpless. 'By learning to understand the meaning behind the actions, it can be easier to stay calm and deal effectively with the challenges that arise.'

"Small shards of metal have been found 'strategically placed' on the play equipment and on the ground of a children's playground. About 20 pieces of metal, which appeared to have been cut from a can of drink, were found scattered across the playground at Kensington Park in Sydney's east on Tuesday. The shards, which were found by Jenny Rose when she took her her 14-month-old grandson Archie to the park, were hidden and only noticeable when they reflected the sun. About 20 pieces of metal, which appeared to have been cut from a can of drink, were found scattered across the playground at Kensington Park in Sydney's east on Tuesday . 'My son went to climb up the stairs and my mum and other parents noticed these shiny things,' Archie's mum Alice Rose told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was like a soft drink can cut up. They were placed all over the steps and on the play equipment. There was also pieces in the rubber flooring wedged in. 'It definitely wasn't an accident... her and a handful of other parents scoured the area and had to pull them out of the ground.' Ms Rose said she takes her son to that particular park everyday and she was stunned that someone had the forward planning to place bits of metal where children could get hurt. 'He was going down the slide and the (metal) was down there. It was where the kids put their hands. They could have easily scratched their whole bodies going down,' she said. 'There's so many little kids that play in that area. It really could have done some damage.' Alice Rose's 14-month-old son Archie was at Kensington Park playground when the shards of metal were found on the stars, wedged in the rubber matting and on the slippery dip . Ms Rose's mother and several other parents found 20 pieces of metal after trawling the playground for 30 minutes on Tuesday. 'It's quite scary that someone consciously planned to do this,' Ms Rose said. 'It's in an area where we go everyday. There's so many weirdos out there, I mean who does that.

"With depraved crimes ranging from terrorism to rape and murder, how do you measure exactly what makes a crime evil - and how evil is one crime compared to another? A forensic psychiatrist is hoping to quantify this idea by surveying millions of adults to establish what he calls a Depravity Standard. Using an online survey, Dr Michael Welner is hoping the standard will be used alongside legal precedent to help juries analyse cases more objectively. The Depravity Standard was created by forensic psychiatrist Dr Michael Welner. Dr Welner said it would be used in courts alongside legal precedent to standardise what constitutes an evil crime, such as genocide (Adolf Hitler left), terrorism (Osama Bin Laden left), rape and more . The Depravity Standard survey was created by Dr Welner and the Forensic Panel in New York. It begins by asking participants for details about their income, level of education and whether they have ever been sentenced to prison. It also asks questions about their views on the death penalty. Users are then randomly assigned a number. As the survey explained: ‘We are interested in the public’s opinion of depravity as it presents itself in different types of crime. ‘[Participants] are randomly assigned to one of four crime categories to help us best understand how to most accurately distinguish depravity in crime, in a way that most closely reflects the attitudes of you and the broader community. The survey (pictured) begins by asking participants for details about their income, level of education and whether they have ever been sentenced to prison. It also asks questions about their views on the death penalty. Users are then randomly assigned a number which relates to a criminal offence category . For example, the study asks the participant to imagine they are on a jury, considering the severity of a sex crime. Participants are then presented with 25 items and are asked to rate them from one to 100 - with 100 being the most extreme depravity (pictured) ‘In this study, we are interested in how you view depravity based on your experience, and how your perspective of depravity may differ from or be similar to others.’ For example, the study asks the participant to imagine they are on a jury, considering the severity of a sex crime. Participants are then presented with 25 items and are asked to rate them from one to 100 - with 100 being the most extreme depravity. Each item has a drop-down menu option so people can add longer descriptions and examples for each item. Users are also encouraged to think about the degree of depravity of each item relative to other answers. Experts have identified characteristics, or ‘red flags’ of nurses who become serial killers. Published in the Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling, the study was carried out by Professor David Wilson and Dr Elizabeth Yardley of the Centre for Applied Criminology from Birminghan City University. It was based on 16 cases from over 37 years. Their examination of hospital-based nurses convicted of serial murder in Europe and North America between 1977 and 2009 used a criminological checklist of 22 factors - or ‘red flags’. The most common red flags are making colleagues anxious, being in possession of drugs at home or in a locker, if the person appears to have a personality disorder, depression, history of mental instability as well as higher incidences of death on his or her shift. According to the research, the findings could be used to improve early identification of so-called Angels of Death. Professor Wilson said: ‘We hope that this research might help hospital administrators to think more critically when they notice a spike in deaths on a particular ward, rather than relying on crude statistical analyses related to particular nurses and their shift patterns. Inevitably that method will lead to miscarriages of justice.’ The authors caution, however, that increased instances of death needs to be considered against other criteria and not simply in isolation. For example, if a user finds they have scored two items with the same number they should consider if they find them to be equal, and therefore deserve the same rating. If they don’t agree, they can change a previous response and save their progress throughout. In the case of the sex crimes category, participants are asked to rate the depravity of the criminal carrying out the offense to cause physical disfigurement, exploiting a trusted relationship, and targeting vulnerable and helpless victims. According to Dr Welner, the Depravity Standard would be used in courts alongside legal precedent. It would attempt to standardise what constitutes an evil crime, based on the views of people globally. Dr Welner told FoxNews: ‘In criminal courts today, the decision to charge a case as heinous, atrocious, cruel, depraved or vile rests with the prosecuting authority because the law does not include a standard to what constitutes an evil crime.’ He hopes the standard would prevent decisions being made based on jury bias, political allegiances or sensationalism.","Depravity Standard survey was created by Dr Michael Welner .

"Jesse 'LJ' Matthew was a 'person of interest' in the search for Hannah Graham . The ‘person of interest’ in the case of missing UVA student Hannah Graham admits that he bought her drinks but denies he drove off with her in his car, MailOnline can reveal exclusively. Jesse ‘LJ’ Matthew has confirmed he met the 18-year-old in Charlottesville’s Downtown Mall on the night she went missing and bought her drinks at a local bar. But Matthew, a nursing assistant at UVA Hospital, told his mother that Hannah did not get into his car and that the pair ‘went their separate ways.' Matthew’s grandmother, Christine Carr, told MailOnline on Saturday: ‘I have been talking with his mother. ‘He said he went his way and she went hers. He told his mother he bought her some drinks.

Big . break: The local police chief described the find of Matthew as a 'person of interest' as a major break in the disappearance of University of Virginia student . Hannah Graham (pictured) Several acquaintances corroborated Mrs Carr's story to MailOnline. 'That's definitely him!' one close friend said. 'He is always wearing those dumb shorts.' Mrs Carr added she was confident her 32-year-old grandson, who has dreadlocks, has nothing to do with the disappearance of Hannah, who has not been seen since the early hours of last Saturday morning. ‘LJ would never hurt anybody,' Mrs Carr, 82, from Charlottesville, told MailOnline. 'I know he is a good boy. I have known him all his life. ‘I’m sure he had nothing to do with it. He is a good boy. He has worked ever since he was able to work. He has never been in trouble. He would do anything to help anybody. ‘I practically raised LJ,' Mrs Carr added. 'His mom was working and I looked after him and his sister, Nicky. ‘He had a live-in girlfriend but I don’t know what happened. They lived together at his apartment.' Mrs Carr said she last saw her grandson on Thursday, when he visited her house along with his mother. ‘He had two bowls of greens and he took some with him,' Mrs Carr said. 'He loves my cooking.’ UVA community members raise their candles in support of the missing during a student-led vigill . Top cop: Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo talks to reporters Friday about new leads in the Graham case . Officers scoured Matthew's the building in search of evidence all day Friday . Chief Tim Longo, of the Charlottesville PD, had identified a dreadlocked man — now identified as Matthew — as the ‘person of interest’ in the hunt for Graham. He was spotted in surveillance footage with his arm round her waist before apparently vanishing in his car together, police said on Friday. Police believe he bought the underage girl an alcoholic drink and have 'every reason to believe' that she was with him when he left 15 minutes later in his 1998 burnt orange Chrysler coupe. The car was searched and seized by police after it was found parked outside a housing complex on Hessian Hills Way, where Matthew lives. Officers spent most of Friday scouring through Matthew's apartment just outside Charlottesville, located about 3 miles from the Downtown Mall where Graham was last seen. Longo told MailOnline that investigators were carrying out a 'forensic . search' of the two-bedroom apartment in Hessian Hills Way, Albemarle . County. 'They will be looking for blood, hair, fibers, the things we are interested in these kind of cases,' he told MailOnline. ‘We’re interested in him,’ Longo added to reporters. ‘We’re interested in talking to him, we’re interested in his interactions with Hannah.’ Law enforcement officials have been issued with multiple warrants for properties within Charlottesville. Details of the warrants remain sealed on the orders of a judge, and will remain secret for up to 180 days, unless the judge changes the ruling. Chief Longo described the finding of Matthew's apartment as a 'big break' in the case. He later tempered his declaration by saying, 'I would hope that is is.' Heartbroken . and hopeful: Hannah with her brother, James, mother, Sue and father, . John. The Graham's issued a joint statement on Tuesday saying they are . hopeful Hannah will be found . With friends: Hannah with a group of friends who have all described her disappearance as extremely uncharacteristic . On Thursday night, thousands gathered for a vigil in the University of Virginia Amphitheater in honor of Graham. Students held candles and played music, all with one message: bring Graham home. In . a statement released through the police, parents John and Susan Graham, . said: 'Hannah is beyond precious to us, and we are devastated by her . disappearance. It is totally out of character for us not to have heard . from her, and we fear foul play.'

"An invisible shield, some 7,200 miles (11,600 km) above Earth, has been found blocking 'killer electrons' from bombarding our planet. These electrons can whip around the planet at near-light speed and have been known to threaten astronauts, fry satellites and damage space systems. If they hit Earth on a large scale, they could knock out power grids, radically change the planet's climate and drive up rates of cancer. The shield was discovered in the Van Allen radiation belts - two doughnut-shaped rings above Earth that are filled with high-energy electrons and protons . But while scientists know this mysterious shield exists, they are baffled as to how it formed and how exactly it works. 'Somewhat like the shields created by force fields on Star Trek that were used to repel alien weapons, we are seeing an invisible shield blocking these electrons,' said Professor Daniel Baker from the University of Colorado Boulder. The shield was discovered in the Van Allen radiation belts - two doughnut-shaped rings above Earth that are filled with high-energy electrons and protons. Held in place by Earth's magnetic field, the Van Allen radiation belts swell and shrink in response to incoming energy disturbances from the sun. They were discovered in 1958 and are comprised of an inner and outer belt extending up to 25,000 miles (40,000km) above Earth's surface. Held in place by Earth's magnetic field, the Van Allen radiation belts swell and shrink in response to incoming energy disturbances from the sun . 'Somewhat like the shields created by force fields on Star Trek (pictured) that were used to repel alien weapons, we are seeing an invisible shield blocking these electrons,' said Professor Daniel Baker . The Van Allen radiation belts are two layers of charged particles orbiting around Earth. They are kept in place by the planet's magnetic field. The belts are comprised of an inner and outer belt extending up to 25,000 miles (40,000km) above Earth's surface. The radiation levels across the belts differ depending on where in the belt they are. The belts were discovered in 1958 by scientist James Van Allen from the University of Iowa while aboard the first U.S space mission. One theory suggested the particles were accelerated as they entered the belt and were trapped inside. The second suggested that particles were created inside the belt and accelerated by a force from within. Nasa sent probes up to track the behaviour of the belts and these satellites have finally proved that electric fields inside the belts tear electrons from atoms and charge them at super speeds. Last year, Professor Baker led a team that used the twin Van Allen Probes launched in 2012 to discover a third, transient 'storage ring'. This ring is located between the inner and outer Van Allen radiation belts and seems to come and go with the intensity of space weather. This ring appears to block the ultrafast electrons from breaching the shield and moving deeper towards Earth's atmosphere. 'It's almost like these electrons are running into a glass wall in space,' said Professor Baker. 'It's an extremely puzzling phenomenon.' The team originally thought the highly charged electrons, which are looping around Earth at more than 100,000 miles per second, would slowly drift downward into the upper atmosphere. But the impenetrable barrier seen by the twin Van Allen belt spacecraft stops the electrons before they get that far, said Professor Baker. The group looked at a number of scenarios that could create and maintain such a barrier. The team wondered if it might have to do with Earth's magnetic field lines. These lines trap and control protons and electrons, bouncing them between Earth's poles like beads on a string. They also looked at whether radio signals from human transmitters on Earth could be scattering the charged electrons at the barrier, preventing their downward motion. Killer electrons whip around the planet at near-light speed and have been known to threaten astronauts, fry satellites and degrade space systems during intense solar storms . But neither explanation held scientific weight, Professor Baker said. 'Nature abhors strong gradients and generally finds ways to smooth them out, so we would expect some of the relativistic electrons to move inward and some outward,' he added. 'It's not obvious how the slow, gradual processes that should be involved in motion of these particles can conspire to create such a sharp, persistent boundary at this location in space.' Another scenario is that the giant cloud of cold, electrically charged gas called the plasmasphere, which begins about 600 miles (960km) above, is scattering the electrons at the boundary. In March, scientists looking at charged particles in space discovered particle hurricanes surrounding Earth. These highly-charged particles are part of the Van Allen belts. Since the belts were first discovered in 1958, astronomers have been trying to trace the source of the super-acceleration. The acceleration is so high that satellites have to protect their sensitive components with shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the belt. Data from Nasa's twin space probes suggests that these the particles may be supercharged by local acceleration, similar to how hurricanes are driven by the evaporation of warm ocean water on Earth. This theory explains why the belts change shape - because the particles numbers swell and drop in different conditions. Space scientists believe these findings are significant because they could also be used to explain the high-energy radiation belts that circle Saturn and Jupiter, as well as around sun-like stars. It could be doing this with low frequency, electromagnetic waves that create a plasmapheric 'hiss'. The hiss sounds like white noise when played over a speaker, Professor Baker said. While the plasmaspheric hiss may play a role in the puzzling space barrier, Professor Baker believes there is more to the story. 'I think the key here is to keep observing the region in exquisite detail, which we can do because of the powerful instruments on the Van Allen probes,' he said. 'If the sun really blasts the Earth's magnetosphere with a coronal mass ejection (CME), I suspect it will breach the shield for a period of time.'","These 'killer electrons' whip around the planet at near-light speed .

"The U.S. Bureau of Land Management has withdrawn a permit allowing a pro-hunting group to hold a wolf and coyote shooting derby on public land in Idaho. The agency canceled the permit last night, after it was issued Nov. 13 to Idaho for Wildlife that provided use of about 3 million acres of federal land for the three-day event in early January. The agency says the group modified the derby's rules, making it unclear if the permit still applied. The derby would have seen an unlimited number of wolves and other animals killed by hunters . Derby organizers say the agency caved in to environmental groups but that the event will still be held on U.S. Forest Service land and private ranches in the east-central part of the state near Salmon. The BLM faced two federal lawsuits from conservation groups contending the agency violated environmental laws in issuing the permit.

"Tomas Paczkowski tried to show his wife he was a dab hand at chores but ended up mistaking the iron for a telephone and burning his face . It is a saying men have been trying - and failing - to shake off for centuries. And husband Tomasz Paczkowski proved the age-old complaint still stands - men simply can't multitask. Mr Paczkowski was determined to show his other half he was able to juggle several jobs at once when he accidentally ironed his face after mistaking it for the telephone. Tomasz - from Elbag, Poland - wanted to show his wife Lila that he was a dab hand at chores around the home. He said: 'I decided to do the ironing while she was out at work, just to prove a point. 'She always complained at me for not . doing the housework so I thought I would do the ironing to save her a . job and prove to her that I'm not as useless around the house as she . thinks. 'Women are always going on about multi-tasking, so I set up the iron, opened a beer and put the boxing on the telly,' he added. 'It all started out well and I was . beginning to think it wasn't that difficult at all. I put up the ironing . board in front of the television and started ironing my shirts. The . first few went ok. But Tomasz, 32, added: 'Trouble was, I then got so involved in the boxing that I wasn't really thinking about what I was doing. 'So when the phone rang I picked up the iron by mistake and pressed it to my ear. 'I really don't know how I could make such a silly mistake. But I guess it proves men are not able to multitask as well as many women can. 'My wife always watches the soaps when she does the ironing and never has any problems.' But Tomas added insult to injury when he sprinted to put cold water on the burn - and ran straight into the bathroom door. Paczkowski from Poland proved the age-old complaint that men can't multitask by failing to juggle several tasks at once . 'That gave me a black eye so now I look more like I've been in a boxing match instead of just watching one,' he added. 'The pain was incredible. It has also been quite embarrassing to tell everyone how the accident happened, but most people have been very understanding but many of my friends find the whole thing very funny. 'I really don't know how it happened. I was just so engrossed in the television.' Doctors say he will make a full recovery from the burns - but Tomasz says he's off housework for ever.

"Secret tapes: Carmen Segarra, a fired NY Fed regulator, recorded meetings which she claims show deferential officials failing to hold banks to account . A fired New York Fed regulator recorded hours of meetings which allegedly show how government supervisors were afraid to ask tough questions of the biggest banks on Wall St. Carmen Segarra, 41, was brought in by New York's banking watchdog in the wake of the financial crisis to tighten the government's grip on the major banks, and assigned to Goldman Sachs. And after encountering a culture of 'fear' and 'deference' to the finance giants at Goldman, Segarra explosively started recording meetings in which regulators offer softball questions to bankers, then congratulate themselves for standing up to them. The Big Short and Liar's Poker author Michael Lewis has dubbed the recordings the 'Ray Rice video of the financial sector.' Segarra was fired after just seven months working at Goldman for the Fed - which she says was because she refused to back down from a damning report on the bank's policies on conflicts of interest. The tapes, handed over to an investigation by ProPublica and This American Life, record meetings between where the Fed's live-in regulators do not press Goldman on parts of its dealings which they themselves admit are 'shady'. Recordings show Michael Silva, the Fed's top man at Goldman, gently raising an issue of potential regulatory lapse in a way that allows Goldman to skirt over it. A clause in a deal which Silva describes in the tapes before a meeting as 'legal but shady' seemed to require approval from the Fed - which had not been given. In the private meeting, Silva aims to 'put a big shot across their bow on that'. But in the meeting itself - after more than 45 minutes without mentioning it, he only mentions that it 'sounds like' the clause 'dropped out'. He is heard saying: 'Just to button up one point. I know the term sheet called for a notice to your regulator. The original term sheet also called for expression of non-objection - sounds like that dropped out at some point, or...?' Refused to toe the line: Segarra claims she was fired from the Fed because she refused to back down over a report which was critical of Goldman Sachs . Heart of Wall St: Segarra made the recordings during her seven-month tenure at Goldman Sachs before she was fired . Silva is later heard reflecting on the meeting, and says that by asking the question - and even having a meeting in the first place - the Fed has succeeded in making Goldman 'think twice'. He says: 'At a minimum, we made them, I guarantee they’ll think twice about the next one, because by putting them through their paces and having that large Fed crowd come in. You know we fussed at ‘em pretty good.' Soft questions: Michael Silva, the Fed's top man at Goldman, is recorded during the tapes . He considers sending a letter - which he acknowledges the bank may ignore - but it is unclear whether it was ever sent. Segarra's analysis of the situation is that it shows the Fed was in the grip of an irrational 'fear' of Goldman which led to them giving the bank an easy ride. She told the radio show: 'They were all sort of afraid of Goldman... What I was sort of seeing and experiencing was this level of deference to the banks. This level of fear.' She is asked whether the attitude amounts to 'regulatory capture' - a form of corruption when officials put the interests of those they are scrutinizing ahead of doing their job. Her response is: 'You know, if that isn't [it], I don't know what is.' Segarra also recorded interviews with her own superiors, in which she is told to adopt a less confrontational style in order to get taken seriously. Segarra filed a lawsuit against the Fed, claiming she was dismissed unfairly and demanded $7million in damages. But her case was struck down by a judge and is now undergoing an appeal. Goldman Sachs and the New York Federal Reserve declined to comment on the specifics of the deals and exchanges mentioned. But in a response to This American Life, the Fed said: 'The New York Fed categorically rejects the allegations being made about the integrity of its supervision of financial institutions. 'Afraid of Goldman': Segarra has now claimed that her recordings show a meek and deferential attitude from government regulators towards the banks they are supposed to be in charge of . On the issue of whether it is difficult for regulators to express concerns, the Fed said: 'Examiners are encouraged to speak up and escalate any concerns they may have regarding the New York Fed or institutions that we supervise. 'The New York Fed provides multiple venues and layers of recourse to help ensure that its employees freely express their views and concerns...' And on Segarra in particular, it said: 'The decision to terminate Ms Segarra's employment with the New York Fed was based entirely on performance grounds, not because she raised concerns as a member of an examination team about an institution.' Carmen Segarra's 46 hours of tapes record conversations between her and superiors at the Fed, as well as interactions between Goldman and its regulators. One of the earliest parts relates to a transaction between Goldman and Satander, a Spanish bank, designed to move shares to help them meet regulations in Europe. Mike Silva, the Fed's top man at Goldman,makes the following plan about how to put his concerns to the bank: . Silva: 'My own personal thinking right now is that we’re looking at a transaction that’s legal but shady. I want to put a big shot across their bow on that. Poking at it, maybe we find something even shadier than we already know. So let’s poke at this thing, let’s poke at it with our usual poker faces, you know. I’d like these guys to come away from this meeting confused as to what we think about it. I want to keep then nervous.' Others: OK. Silva: Does that make sense? Woman: Yeah yeah, it does. However, in the meeting, Silva does not make his point for more than 45 minutes. When he does, he says the following. Silva to Goldman bankers: 'Just to button up one point. I know the term sheet called for a notice to your regulator. 'The original term sheet also called for expression of non-objection - sounds like that dropped out at some point, or...?' Silva, who appears not to get a definitive answer, doesn't bring it up again. After the meeting, another Fed worker is recorded saying the following: . Fed worker:  'I would add to his comments in that I think we don’t want to discourage Goldman from disclosing these types of things in the future, and therefore maybe you know some comment that says don’t mistake our inquisitiveness, and our desire to understand more about the marketplace in general, as a criticism of you as a firm necessarily. 'Like I don’t want to, I don’t want to hit them on the bat with the head, and they say screw it we’re not gonna disclose it again, we don’t need to.' [Goldman are required by law to give the Fed any information they ask for] . Later Silva mentions his performance in the meeting, and says he thinks it will bring about change: . Silva: 'At a minimum, we made them, I guarantee they’ll think twice about the next one, because by putting them through their paces and having that large fed crowd come in. 'You know we fussed at ‘em pretty good.' Segarra also recorded her superior at the Fed - Johnathan Kim - giving her advice on her role, in which he tries to change her attitude. Kim: I want to manage your sort of career and expectations, right? I want you to be successful. Ok? There are –there's information that's coming in, there's opinions that are coming in. Right?... 'I’m never questioning about the knowledge base or the assessments or those things, it’s really about how you are perceived, right? So if there’s more a general sort of feedback that says that it’s not only one person, it’s not only two persons, but many more people who are perceiving that you’re –um, you have more sharper elbows, right. ' Or that you’re sort of breaking eggs. And obviously I don’t know what the right word is.' Two weeks before she was fired, Kim told Segarra the following: . Kim: 'Couple of things, ok, that I would suggest: Have a sense of humility, right? 'Because a lot of the things that you say, and this is the way you’re coming across,I think I know you well enough that that’s not what you’re saying, right? 'But if I were to be a new person, I would say Carmen, you’re very arrogant. Right?'","Carmen Segarra, 41, made recordings while working for the Fed at Goldman .

"Lord Hanningfield is being investigated for alleged fraud over claims he cheated the Parliamentary expenses system to make up to £300 a day . Police last night confirmed a Peer was being investigated for alleged fraud over claims he cheated the Parliamentary expenses system to make up to £300 a day. Lord Hanningfield - who was expelled from the Conservative Party after he was sent to prison for ripping off taxpayers during the original MPs’ expenses scandal - was made to repay more than £3,000 after he was caught by a newspaper ‘clocking in’ to Parliament, then leaving just minutes later, in order to claim a daily attendance allowance. When confronted, he told a reporter: ‘I could name 50 other peers that do it.’ Police initially said there was no evidence a crime had been committed, but have now launched a new investigation. Last night Scotland Yard confirmed the suspended peer had been interviewed under caution over allegations of fraud following the launch of a new criminal investigation. The Daily Mirror newspaper, which first revealed the alleged fraud, said police were understood to have asked him about his claims other peers had also turned up to Parliament solely to collect the £300 tax-free allowance. Campaigners also told the paper they believed the case could lead to major changes in the House of Lords. Labour MP Michael McCann said: ‘If a constituent of mine clocked in and disappeared they would be sacked – no ifs, no buts. 'If other members of the Lords have participated in this behaviour, they have to be identified and dealt with.’ Lord Kennedy told the paper: ‘It is right that police are looking again at his outrageous abuse of expenses. Here was a man who was turning up, signing in and then getting back on the Tube just a few minutes later. ‘Hanningfield will now have to name names and justify his claims about others. Any wrongdoing must be properly investigated but the vast bulk of peers would not do anything like that.’ Police first investigated Lord Hanningfield, 74, after campaigning MP John Mann wrote to police in December last year urging them to look into the newspaper claims. Officers initially decided there was no evidence a criminal offence had been committed and instead said claims should be investigated by the Lords watchdog, the Commissioner for Standards. Following the Commissioner’s investigation, peers backed a recommendation to suspend Lord Hanningfield until May 2015. He was also ordered to pay back £3,300 for the days he was unable to show he carried out parliamentary work. Scotland Yard confirmed the suspended peer has been interviewed under caution over allegations of fraud . Lord Hanningfield was  sent to prison in 2011 for ripping off taxpayers during the MPs’ expenses scandal . As a result, police reviewed their original decision not to pursue the allegations and Lord Hanningfield was interviewed at an east London police station. A Scotland Yard spokesman last night said: ‘Following the publication of the Lords Commissioner’s report in May 2014, officers conducted a thorough review of both the contents of the report and the full material available to them and a decision has been taken to instigate an investigation. ‘I can confirm a 73-year-old man attended by appointment an east London police station and was interviewed under caution in relation to an allegation of fraud.’ In 2011, Lord Hanningfield was found guilty of fiddling his expenses in a separate case and jailed for nine months. He was also expelled from the Conservative Party. The former pig farmer was sent to prison for falsely claiming almost £14,000 for staying overnight in London on official business when he had not actually been in the capital. He served nine-weeks of his sentence before being released with an electronic tag.

"The stepdaughter of Texas Ebola victim, Thomas Duncan, who called 911 and rode in the ambulance with the man she calls 'Daddy' has been told she can return to work, MailOnline can reveal. Nursing assistant Youngor Jallah, 35, has been in 'quarantine' in her small Dallas apartment along with her husband, Aaron Yah, 43, and their four children ages 2 to 11 since Thomas Duncan's devastating diagnosis last Monday. MailOnline has reported that Mr Yah, also a nursing assistant, had been told he could return to work at the end of last week. Scroll down for video . Green light: Youngor Jallah, the stepdaughter of Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan, told MailOnline that the CDC has told her that she could return to work as a nursing assistant. But she isn't leaving her home at the moment . Fighting for life: Thomas Eric Duncan, seen here with a relative when he first landed in the U.S., is in a critical condition and is now receiving an experimental drug to help save him . Ms Jallah whose contact with Mr Duncan - who remains in a critical condition - was far more intimate and prolonged than that of her husband, told MailOnline on Monday: 'The CDC came yesterday. They said I can go back to work but I do not know what I will do. I will not go back yet.' Doctors say that no-one is at risk of catching the virus unless they come into contact with a sufferer who is exhibiting symptoms. But it is unlikely that Youngor will return to work until the family have gone through the 21 days considered the latest time between exposure and manifestation of Ebola. She does not intend to allow her eldest child to return to school before the October 17. She has no child-care provisions either - as her mother, Louise Troh, 54, the woman who Mr Duncan traveled to the States to marry, provided childcare and remains in quarantine in a secret location along with her 13-year-old son, nephew and a friend. The decision to let Ms Jallah return to work is proof of CDC official's confidence that there are no contagious carriers of Ebola in the community. But Ms Jallah and her family still live with the fear that they may develop symptoms. She does not hug or kiss her children out of fear and the family pray together each day, asking God to 'Destroy Ebola', to save their family, to save America. It was Ms Jallah who first raised the alarm after Mr Duncan’s condition suddenly worsened. He had been sent home from his first hospital visit with medication for his diarrhea. Ms Jallah had seen Mr Duncan following his arrival in the States at the end of last month. Her children had slept in the apartment. Clean up: Workers in hazmat suits continued to scrub down and clear out the apartment Duncan stayed in . Sick with worry: Aaron Yah and his family are being monitored by the CDC after visiting Ebola victim Thomas Dunn on Sunday - the day he was taken to hospital and put in isolation . On Sunday September 28, Ms Jallah said, her mother called her and asked her to come to their home in the now infamous Ivy Apartments complex. Speaking to the Washington Post Ms Jallah recalled her mother's words: 'She said, ""Your step daddy is not feeling OK. He's been going to the bathroom all night. You should come over and fetch him some breakfast.' Ms Jallah did not bring her children with her when she went over, though Mr Yah also saw Mr Duncan that morning. He told MailOnline: 'He was lying on the bed. I asked him how he was and he said, ""I'm not okay"".' By the time Ms Jallah arrived Mr Duncan had no appetite for breakfast. She recalled: 'I brought him hot tea but he could drink only half of it.' A trained nursing assistant, Ms Jallah took his temperature which was 104F and his blood pressure which was low. She said: 'I went to Walmart to get him a blanket and put it round him but he was so sick.’ It was Ms Jallah who told Mr Duncan he had to go to hospital and who called 911. She travelled with her stepfather in the ambulance, bringing the contaminated blanket with her and warning the emergency workers to be careful of 'viruses' because he was from West Africa. They immediately put on their masks. Yet in spite of this close and prolonged contact with Mr Duncan - who neighbors reported was 'vomiting wildly' before the arrival of the ambulance - Ms Jallah and her family were left completely in the dark as to what precautions they should take. MailOnline first reported the family's distress at having no instructions from the CDC and revealed that they had placed themselves under quarantine. When violent storms swept Dallas on Thursday they were left without power, without information and without food and diapers for their youngest child. Power was only returned to their apartment yesterday. As Mr Duncan continues to fight for his life and remains in critical condition the emotional toll that this ordeal has taken on the family as a whole is clear. On Sunday, George Mason, Senior Pastor at Wilshire Baptist Church where Ms Troh worships, told of her agony as she lives 'moment by moment'. He revealed that she had not been able to speak with Mr Duncan since his condition was downgraded to critical. He said, ‘His life is hanging in the balance.’ Missteps: CDC and Dallas officials had to admit another failing on Sunday when they revealed that a homeless man - who was in the ambulance after Duncan - had walked off while receiving treatment . It was confirmed on Monday that Mr Duncan is now receiving an experimental drug - different to that given to two American doctors who contracted the virus in Africa. Pharmaceutical company Chimerix announced that the Federal Drug Administration has approved the use of its drug brincidofovir to treat Ebola victims during emergency situations. The FDA has extended an Emergency Investigational New Drug Application meaning that the drug can be used without waiting for the results of more stringent agency testing. Meanwhile, CDC assurances that the situation was under control was dealt a severe blow as it emerged that the homeless man who had been the first patient to ride in the ambulance following Mr Duncan had gone missing. Officials were forced to admit that he had 'wandered off' while under observation. Michael Lively has since been found and is being held in the psych ward of Parkland Hospital while authorities seek a court order to keep him there against his will until he has proved asymptomatic for 21 days. Public health officials have insisted that there is ‘zero risk’ that he is contagious. The CDC has also announced that it may consider introducing screening to travellers arriving from Ebola affected countries. Critics have questioned the efficacy of health checks including taking travelers' temperatures pointing to the fact that Mr Duncan was apparently fit and healthy when he landed on US soil with his deadly cargo. But the White House has ruled out a travel ban from effected countries.","Youngor Jallah, 35, was called by the CDC on Sunday to say she can go back to work .

"The New England Patriots' cheerleaders reduced a  player of the opposite team to tears when they paid tribute to his young daughter who is battling  cancer. Devon Still's daughter Leah, four, was diagnosed with stage 4 Neuroblastoma in June, and the Patriots' cheerleaders showed their support when they played the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. Instead of their normal red, white and blue outfits, the Patriots' cheerleaders donned Still's Bengals jersey, a  tribute which reduced the 25-year-old defensive tackle to tears on the field. Scroll down for video . Showing support: The New England Patriots' cheerleaders wear the jerseys of Cincinnati Bengals player Devon Still as a tribute to his daughter Leah who is battling stage 4 cancer . A father's love: Devon Still, 25, with his daughter Leah, 4, who is being treated for Stage 4 neuroblastoma and has been given a 50-50 chance of survival . Still has not been able to devote himself fully to football since Leah was diagnosed with Stage 4 neuroblastoma in June this year. Initially missing out on Cincinnati's 53-man roster so he could be by his daughter's side, Still was then offered a spot on the practice squad, ensuring Leah would be covered under the team's health insurance policy. He went public with his daughter's cancer diagnosis 'not for sympathy,' he wrote on Instagram, but 'because I've come to the point where I no longer [am] feeling sorry but [want] to ask that y'all keep my daughter in your prayers... 'The more prayers that go up, the more faith we [have] that she will overcome this obstacle,' he wrote. 'if y'all know me y'all know this girl is my world...I know that she is strong and she won't let anything hold her down without a fight.' #LeahStrong: The moving tribute by the Patriots' cheerleaders to his daughter reduced Stills to tears . Fighting: Still posted a video of himself giving Leah a peptalk ahead of major surgery, which then went viral . Still has set up a donation program encouraging people to pledge money for every sack the Bengals' defense gets this season in an effort to help raise money and awareness about pediatric cancer. 'Kids always look up to their parents, but in just a matter of a week that all reversed for me,' Still wrote on the campaign page . 'I can honestly say I truly look up to my daughter now. In the four years of life she has had, she has been through way more than I have in 24. Her courage, strength, and high spirits through it all is nothing short of inspirational. 'So I am dedicating my season to her and inspiring others like she has inspired me.' Last week, Still posted a video of him giving Leah a pep talk before she went into surgery to remove a cancerous tumor which went viral. Charity works: The Cincinnati Bengals have been donating the proceedings from the sales of Still's jersey to cancer research and the hospital where Leah is receiving treatment . Raising awareness: Sales of Still's jersey - seen on the Patriots' cheerleaders on Sunday - raised $400,000 in support for cancer research and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital in the first four days it was on sale . Uniform support: Before donning Still's jersery, the Patriots' cheerleaders wore  pink to acknowledge Breast Cancer Awareness Month . However, Still made it clear that Leah still faced a long road ahead, as the little girl will require further treatments to remove the cancer in her bone marrow. He Tweeted: 'Just to clear up some rumors...my daughter is NOT cancer free..today was a big step towards that but still a long road ahead. 'She has stage 4 which means the cancer spread to her bone marrow which we hope will be removed with her next couple of treatments.' The Cincinnati Bengals announced last month that they would donate 100 per cent of the proceeds from sales of Still’s No 75 jersey in support for cancer research and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Still's jersey sold more in its first 24 hours than any other Bengals jersey had in a single day and raised $400,000 in the first four days the jersey was on sale .

"Former Delhi University vice-chancellor Deepak Pental was arrested, but later released after a court order . Former Delhi University vice-chancellor Deepak Pental was detained by a Delhi court on Tuesday in a case of alleged plagiarism, cheating and forgery. However, he was later released from Tihar Jail on the Delhi High Court’s direction. In a case dating back to 2009, professor Pental has been accused by another Delhi University professor, P. Pardha Saradhi, of plagiarising his paper on biotechnology and publishing it as his own. Saradhi has also accused Pental of stealing genetically modified seeds from his laboratory for unauthorised research work. According to the police and Tihar Jail authorities, 63-year-old Pental was released from the prison at around 7.30pm after the High Court’s order was communicated to them. Pental was taken into custody and detained by the police earlier in the day after a magisterial court ordered his arrest. Charges . Pental refuted all the charges against him and maintained that he is innocent. “These are all frivolous charges and only court will decide the truth. I don’t wish to speak much on the issue,” Pental told Mail Today. Saradhi, a professor in the Department of Environmental Studies, alleged that his research work was plagiarised by Pental and another student. “KVSK Prasad was a Ph.D. student under me at the Jamia Millia Islamia. Pental appointed him as a post-doctoral scholar under himself. In connivance with Pental, Prasad stole the seed of codA transgenic Indian mustard developed by me and my team under India-Japan Cooperative Science Programme. Pental also allowed Prasad to use this GM seed to carry further research, fully aware that all GM materials are put under the tag of ‘Hazardous’ under Environmental Protection Act (EPA),” Saradhi alleged. Saradhi also said that Prasad and other members of Pental’s research team failed to obtain any new results. “Prasad and Deepak plagiarised the research work carried out by my team at Jamia during 1995-1999 and showed as the work carried in Deepak Pental’s lab during 2001-2004. Sentences (with exactly similar verbatim) and the data (exactly similar figures/ numbers) were copied from the report submitted by me to DST under India-Japan Cooperative Science Programme,” Saradhi alleged. Saradhi claimed that he complained to the University, which formed a committee to examine the matter. The committee gave Pental a clean chit, after which Saradhi filed a case in the court. As Pental was taken into custody on Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vinod Kumar Gautam’s order at around 12:45pm, his advocate moved the High Court for stay of his arrest. The matter came up for hearing before Justice S. Muralidhar, who stayed the magisterial court’s arrest warrant, saying the trial court order is suspended. Justice Muralidhar directed Pental to appear before the trial court, when the bail application is listed. The HC asked the Registrar General to immediately convey the order to the Superintendent, Tihar Jail, by fax and by telephone, to facilitate Pental's immediate release. The HC order came on a plea moved by senior advocate Arvind Nigam, representing Pental, alleging that the trial court passed a wrong order and he was illegally taken into custody and sent to Tihar jail.","Deepak Pental is accused of plagiarising a 2009 paper by another DU professor .

"A doctor checked in at Atlanta airport in protective goggles, gloves, boots and overalls in a bitter protest at the CDC for 'sugar-coating' the true scale of Ebola in the US. Gil Mobley said he was left horrified yesterday when he was allowed to fly from Guatemala to Atlanta with no interrogation or checks on his equipment. Enraged, the microbiologist and emergency trauma physician boarded his next flight from Atlanta International Airport - minutes from the center's headquarters - wearing a protective white jumpsuit branded with the words 'CDC is lying!' Scroll down for video . Protest: Dr Gil Mobley wore protective gear warning passers-by the CDC is 'sugar-coating' the threat of Ebola . It comes two days after a man in Texas became the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in an American hospital. And today it emerged a patient in Honolulu, Hawaii, has been placed in isolation with suspected Ebola. Blasting the CDC for doing nothing to stop the spread, Mobley called on airports and passengers to take their own action instead of waiting for official guidance. 'Yesterday, I came through international customs at the airport,' he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'The only question they asked arriving passengers is if they had tobacco or alcohol.' 'The CDC is asleep at the wheel,' Mobley said. '...It's going to be bad, and I want to make sure that this conversation is happening that this could get out of control in the United States.' Anger: He said he was allowed to fly from Guatemala to Atlanta with no checks on his equipment or questions . Advise: Dr Mobley warns the US will have to deal with a serious case of Ebola very soon and we're not ready . 'With 10,000 people flying out if west Africa daily its only a matter of time until all corners of the world are exposed,' Mobley said. 'Once it devours third world countries, the US will be importing these cases daily. Eventually the clusters will overwhelm even the most advanced countries' ability to isolate and quarantine all those exposed. 'The CDC needs to be honest with us.' A CDC spokesman rebuffed the protest, claiming there was no risk that needed to be investigated. Action: Mobley, a microbiologist, urged airports to join the conversation rather than wait for official guidance . Prediction: Mobley, an emergency trauma physician, said he believes the US will be importing cases daily . 'There were no signs of any disease when the gentleman boarded the flight,' said Dr. Tom Kenyon, director of the CDC's Center for Global Health. 'This was not a failure of the screening process at the airport.' Up to 100 people were in contact with the Dallas Ebola patient at some point, Texas health officials said today, marking a significant jump from the 18 people that authorities had said may have been exposed to the deadly virus. Infected: This is Thomas Eric Duncan, right, who became the first patient to be diagnosed with Ebola in the US . Route: He traveled from Liberia to Belgium, then on to Washington where he switched on to a Dallas flight . Four members of 42-year-old Thomas Eric Duncan's family have been legally ordered to stay home as a precaution even though they are not showing symptoms, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement on Thursday. Violating the order could result in criminal charges. The health officials said around 100 people may have come into contact with Mr Duncan. Earlier, they had put the figure at up to 18, including five children. Some parents have temporarily removed their children from Dallas schools after learning that the five students may have come into contact with the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S.","Gil Mobley said he was not interrogated before Guatemala to Atlanta flight .

"Tragic: 87-year-old Dorothy Griffiths was left unattended for ten minutes because her Muslim nurse was praying, an inquest heard . An elderly woman who suffered a fall was left lying on the floor at  a care home for up to ten minutes because a senior nurse was  praying, an inquest heard. Abdul Bhutto, an agency nurse, told junior staff they would have to wait until he finished before he would attend to 87-year-old Dorothy  Griffiths, who died nine days later. Mrs Griffiths, who suffered from  Alzheimer’s, was left on the floor while the Muslim nurse continued to pray on his mat. Eventually he arrived and examined the pensioner before telling carers to put  her back to bed. She was later found unresponsive and was taken to hospital. Mrs Griffiths had cut her head and gashed her hip when she fell from her bed during the night and was found on the floor when staff rushed to her room after hearing a loud bang. A carer went to the care home’s office for help to lift her but Mr Bhutto, who was in charge, said they would have to wait until he had finished his prayers. Carer Zoe Shaw told the inquest: ‘It took between five and ten  minutes because he was praying. A staff member told me we had to wait for him to finish.’ The inquest heard Mr Bhutto was the most senior nurse on duty. He examined Mrs Griffiths on the floor but did not call an ambulance and instructed carers to put her back to bed. But instead Mrs Shaw, worried that she might fall again, washed the pensioner, dressed her and sat with her in the office. Claim: The incident happened at Valley Park care home in South Yorkshire, pictured, in October last year . At about 5.45am she took Mrs Griffiths to the lounge and said she appeared to be well and was ‘talking fine’ and walking around. But at breakfast time Mrs Griffiths was found to be unresponsive and an ambulance was called at about 7.30am. Mrs Shaw, who broke down and wept during her evidence, said she would have called an ambulance immediately after the fall. She said that as a carer she did not realise she could and since this incident she had discovered staff could override a nurse’s decision. Mrs Griffiths, a former pub landlady and the widow of former Barnsley footballer Steve Griffiths, had been a resident at the  privately-run Valley Park Nursing Home in Wombwell, near Barnsley, since 2009 and died in hospital on November 3. Mr Bhutto failed to appear at  the inquest in Sheffield and a  summons had to be issued for him to attend later in the year. The court heard he had been contacted and denied being senior nurse that night. After the hearing was adjourned, Mrs Griffiths’s daughter Jean David, 61, said the family had been put through more grief due to the nurse not turning up. Mrs David added: ‘You put your trust in these people. ‘What would happen if there was a fire, would they then stop praying?’ It is understood Mrs Griffiths died from a brain haemorrhage and pneumonia although this has yet to be confirmed. A spokesman for the home, which is run by the Mimosa Healthcare Group, declined to comment.","Dorothy Griffiths, 89, fell from her bed, cutting her head and leaving a gash in her hip .

"North Korean despot Kim Jong Un ordered one of his top military officials be dragged from his home and shot by firing squad for changing the words of a socialist anthem when singing karaoke. Kim was said to be furious after learning the man had changed the lines 'thanks to our party' to 'thanks to your party' and 'Hate your enemies, love your country,' to 'Hate your wife, love your mistress'. The 'Supreme Leader'  said that the move was sign of a rebellious spirit and the man was instantly dragged out of his home and put to death by firing squad the next day. Scroll down for video . Tyrant: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has had one of his top military officials dragged from his home and shot by firing squad for changing the words of a socialist anthem while performing karaoke . In South Korea it was suggested that the man had simply made a mistake in the wording in the first instance and had tried to make a joke in the second although it backfired badly after it was seen as lowering the moral standard by the supreme leader. Only recently it was revealed that other former military leaders had also suffered firing squads fates after they were caught watching Western soap operas. It was believed the karaoke and singing patriotic songs was a relatively safe pastime, but even this now might be reviewed given the risk of death by firing squad for getting the lyrics wrong. A handout picture released yesterday shows Kim Jong Un sitting in the cockpit as he inspects a North Korean air force fighter jet . It comes as a European Union official  confirmed that North Korea has invited the EU's special representative for human rights to visit the country. A visit by Stavros Lambrinidis would be a significant step toward resuming a human rights dialogue between the EU and North Korea, which broke off previous talks in 2003. On Thursday, a North Korean diplomat to the United Nations told The Associated Press that the invitation had been sent. The EU official spoke Friday on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment. The EU has said Lambrinidis recently met with a Pyongyang representative.","Man changed words  from 'Hate your enemies, love your country,' to 'Hate your wife, love your mistress'

"A Champagne price war has been triggered with Tesco slashing the price of one award winning brand to just £8. Britain’s biggest grocer and drinks retailer has reduced its Louis Delaunay champagne by some 70per cent from the official list figure of £25.99. The champagne is now cheaper than many supposedly inferior sparkling wines such as Prosecco from Italy and Cava from Spain. Tesco has slashed the price of its Champagne, left, to just £8 while Asda's offering, right, is £10 . Lidl's Comte de Senneval Champagne, left, is £11.99 while Sainsbury's Henry Dumanois, right, is £12 . Historically, supermarkets have used bread, milk and baked beans as loss leaders to tempt shoppers through the doors, however Tesco has taken the challenge to the luxury end of the shopping list. The £8 price tag appears to be lowest price charged for a big brand champagne, produced according to the rules a heritage of the renowned wine region, for at least 10 years. It represents a serious challenge to the rest of the high street, particularly Aldi and Lidl, who are thriving on the back of an image of providing luxury products at affordable prices. Currently, the cheapest champagne from Aldi is its Veuve Monsigny Champagne Brut  at £9.99, while Lidl offers the Comte de Senneval champagne at £11.99. On the face of it Tesco’s Louise Delaunay is a quality product. The drink, which comes from the town of Dizy, in the Champagne region of France, is described as having strong floral aromas and an elegant citrus flavour. This summer it won a bronze medal in blind taste tests at International Wine & Spirit Competition – an event considered the Oscars for the wine and champagne industry. It is produced from a combination of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay by the champagne maker Les Roches Blanches. The move by Tesco is timed to win vital Christmas shoppers, however it also taps into the fact that a growing number of people are regularly drinking champagne at home rather than just on special occasions. Industry figures show sales of sparkling wine rose by five per cent in terms of volume and 14.8per cent in value in the past year, as people traded up from cheap Cava to more expensive Prosecco and Champagne. Sales of sparkling wine were up by £70million to some £541million with more than 40per cent of people saying they had bought bubbly in the past year. Morrisons are charging £13.99 for their Gartissier, left and Aldi want £9.99 for the Monsigny, right . Kevan Mulcahey, head of alcohol at Kantar Worldpanel, said: ‘Shoppers are looking for something a bit special to treat themselves, and sparkling wine is a luxury product with an affordable price tag. ‘Shoppers are trading up from Cava to Prosecco and Prosecco to Champagne, boosting sales of sparkling wine by 14.8per cent compared with the same time last year. ‘Motivations for sparkling wine occasions have become more about ‘having a laugh’.’ Tesco champagne buyer Charlie Craven said: ‘This is a quality, award winning champagne and to find something this good for £8 on British high streets you’d have to go back at least 10 years. ‘We’re delighted that we can bring this to our customers at such a fantastic price.’ While the official list price is £25.99, Tesco has been selling it recently at half price of £12.99 and it is now going even further to undercut mainstream rivals such as Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons. Currently, Asda cheapest champagne is Pierre Darcys, which the company has cut from £24.25 to £10. Sainsbury’s Henry Dumanois Champagne Brut is down by £4 to £12, while Morrisons Champagne Gartissier Brut Nv is £13.99. A recent survey published by Which? chose Sainsbury’s Blanc de Blanc Brut Champagne at £22.50 a bottle as the best choice alongside Piper Heidsieck Brut Champagne at £33. The best Prosecco came from a Co-op own label at £9.99 with the judges praising its balance of bitterness and fruitiness. The price cut by Tesco appears to be a direct response to Asda cutting its Pierre Darcys champagne from £24.25 to £10. Asda promoted its £10 deal by recreating a magazine front cover featuring reality TV star Kim Kardashian that went viral online when she vowed to ‘break the internet’. In the Asda mock-up a model balances a glass on her rear, while Champagne shoots over her head to fill it, as the tagline reads: ‘Don’t break the budget: Pierre Darcys’.","Supermarkets have slashed the price of Champagne for the Xmas rush .

"Fashion label Valentino has been slammed by industry insiders for featuring photographer Terry Richardson in its latest campaign, despite the series of shocking allegations of sexual assault that have been made against him by more than a dozen models. It is the fourth time that the 49-year-old has appeared in a Valentino ad, having helped to showcase the brand's accessories collections for the past three seasons. And while his face is not featured in the campaigns - just his arms and legs, which are easily identified by his distinctive tattoos - many critics have been left horrified that the brand has continued to show its support for Richardson and his work. Scroll down for video . 'Very questionable': Valentino's latest campaign is the fourth to feature Richardson's distinctively tattooed arms . 'At this stage it seems [Valentino is] actively trying on bank on [Richardson's] very questionable brand of edginess,' Styleite writer Hannah Ongley explained. 'Personally, as part of the younger crowd they’re trying to tap into, I prefer rape vibes as a removable feature rather than inextricably connected to the product.' Style Blazer's Nicole Brown added: 'While [Bill] Cosby's nearly 50 plus year career and clean cut image has been destroyed in under 2 weeks, [Terry Richardson] has continued to work within his industry, despite the public confession of several models who to have been taken advantage of. 'This marks [Valentino's] third time collaborating [with him] and although the photos are aesthetically pleasing, we can’t help but wonder if the truth behind the Richardson claims will ever come out.' According to Vox.com,the first allegations made against Richardson came to light in 2005, when he faced two lawsuits from models accusing him of sexual assault. He settled both cases out of court. Since then, dozens of models have come forward to accuse the photographer of abusing his role and taking advantage of young women and men while working with them. In October last year, a young woman from London started an online campaign calling for brands to cut ties with the photographer once and for all. 'More awareness needs to be brought to light that Terry Richardson is negatively influencing media with his supposed exploit & abuse of certain models, mainstream degrading pornographic imagery, and inappropriate and unprofessional behavior,' Londoner Alice Louise wrote on her petition. Considerate and respectful? The 49-year-old has continued to deny all allegations made against him . 'WHY if we are aware of these allegations are big companies STILL using Terry Richardson as a photographer and still giving him positive press if he is an ALLEGED sex offender? 'These allegations need to be looked at more closely and the appropriate justice received. They should not be ignored. By continuing to employ him for editorial fashion shoots, or to run advertising campaigns shot by him is to CONDONE his behavior.' And while Valentino has continued to show support for the photographer, both Vogue and H&M have publicly distanced themselves from Richardson, with a Vogue spokesperson confirming in April that the magazine has no plans to work with him again. In a statement made to US Weekly, the publication said: 'The last assignment Terry Richardson had for US Vogue appeared in the July 2010 issue and we have no plans to work with him in the future.' Richardson has continued to deny the allegations made against him, writing on his blog: 'I just want to take a moment to say I’m really hurt by the recent and false allegations of insensitivity and misconduct. 'I've always been considerate and respectful of the people I photograph and I view what I do as a real collaboration between myself and the people in front of the camera.'","It is the fourth time that the 49-year-old has featured in the brand's campaigns - despite numerous calls for him to be dropped .

"If you don't believe in climate change, you're less likely to feel that the weather is getting warmer - and vice versa. That's according to a study that analysed how people remembered a particularly warm winter in the US in 2012. And they found those who believed in climate change remembered it being warmer, while those who didn't thought it was colder. US researchers say political beliefs affect our view on the weather. They studied perceptions of the anomalously warm US winter in 2012 (Times Square shown). Democrats and women remembered the winter as being warmer. But Republicans and men said that it was colder than it was . The research, published in Nature Climate Change, was carried out by three US sociologists - , Dr Aaron McCright of Michigan State University, Dr Riley Dunlap of Oklahoma State, and Dr Chenyang Xiao of American University. They studied how people remembered the erroneously warm winter of 2012, which was the fourth warmest on record for the US of the previous 117 winters. A report from the World Bank Group recently claimed that the world must brace itself for more extreme weather, as it is locked on a path to unstoppable warming. They said some effects of climate change will be unavoidable owing to past and predicted emissions from power plants, factories and cars. But they added the worst impacts could be avoided by cutting global emissions. The report, entitled 'Turn down the Heat: Confronting the New Climate Normal', stated that the average temperature on Earth will be 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial levels by 2050. Sea levels will also continue to rise as the vast ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica thaw slowly, they said. During the winter, the seasonal average was about 1.9°C (3.9°F) above the 20th century average. The researchers compared data from Gallup polls in early March 2012 after the winter ended with temperature data from the US, reports the Washington Post. Most correctly said that the weather had been unusual, with those in more affected areas noticing the conditions more. But those with certain political and scientific beliefs had differing views on how severe the changes had been. 'Democrats [were] more likely than Republicans to perceive local winter temperatures as warmer than usual,' the researchers wrote. Liberals and women were also more likely than conservatives and males to attribute the warmer-than-normal local winter temperatures to global warming. The results suggest that, apart from actual science, people's view on climate change can be skewed by their beliefs. And as the climate has the potential to become more out-of-tune with normality in the coming years, the researchers warn it will be harder and harder to convince people on global warming. For example, they say, climate change not only drives warmer weather but also cold extremes owing to increased vapour in the atmosphere. 'If you can't reach the committed conservatives on the fact that a significantly warmer season might be due to anthropogenic [human-caused] global warming, I think it's going to be really hard to convince them that the current situation is due to anthropogenic climate change,' study co-author Riley Dunlap told the Washington Post.' The results were also consistent with people's beliefs on global warming (stock image shown). And the researchers warn it will be difficult to convince people the climate is changing due to human activity as it becomes more wild, with both colder and warmer spells expected .","US researchers say political beliefs affect our view on the weather .

"An incredible new map could reveal that 13th century Italian explorer Marco Polo was actually the first European to discover America - more than two centuries before Christopher Columbus set sail for the New World. A crude map drawn on sheepskin shows what appears to be the Bering Straight, Alaska, the Aleutian Islands and the west coast of North America. 'Map with Ship' comes from a trove of 14 documents that have just been studied in depth for the first time. They were found in the 1930s in a trunk in that belonged to an Italian immigrant who settled in San Jose, California. Scroll down for video . 'Map with Ship': This sheepskin map is claimed to be a copy of a sketch Marco Polo made showing Alaska, the Aleutian Islands and the Bering Straight in the 13th century . The map offers accurate geographical representations to a modern satellite image of Alaska, the west coast and the Pacific. The Bering Straight . Marco Pollo was famous for his journey to China - and for his tall tales . The documents, reportedly written by Polo's daughter Bellala recount how the Venetian explorer met a Syrian trader on the Kamchatka Peninsula on the far eastern edge of the Asian continent then sailed across the Bering Straight to North America. Before his voyage, the trader told Polo about a land far east - a 40 days voyage from Kamchatka,Smithsonian Magazine reports. It is believed that if Polo sailed to North America, he would have crossed the Bering Straight - a 51-mile stretch of waster that connects the easternmost point of Asia  to the westernmost point of Alaska. This new land, the documents say, was called 'the Peninsula of Seals' and it was 'twice as far from China' as Kamchatka and Polo soon set sail in search of it. Polo arrived, according to the documents, and discovered a people who wore seal skins, ate only fish and lived in homes 'under the earth,' according to the Smithsonian. The documents also describe a great glacier that came down into the sea. It appears that Polo then sailed around the Alaskan coast - possibly even around the Aleutian Islands, east to British Columbia and down the Canadian coast. One expert, who authored a Website called MarcoPoloinSeattle.com even claims that the Venetian explorer even made it to Washington and Puget Sound. If the documents are authentic, they could overturn commonly held beliefs about Columbus' 1492 voyage from Portugal. 'It would mean that an Italian got knowledge of the west coast of North America or he heard about it from Arabs or Chinese,' historian Benjamin B. Olshin, a history professor at University of the Arts in Philadelphia, told Smithsonian. His book, The Mysteries of the Marco Polo Maps, is due out in November. The documents have been in the Library of Congress since the 1930s and were even analyzed by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. The account, while fascinating, has several holes. The first is that Polo - an infamous teller of tall tales - never specifically mentioned his travels to this new land in his world-famous account of his journey, The Travels of Marco Polo. He did, however, say on his death bed, 'I did not tell half of what I saw.' Second, the source material remains dubious. Marcian Rossi, the immigrant who donated the documents to the Library of Congress, says he inherited them from a wealthy family member. Carbon dating on one of the sheepskin maps reveals it was created in the 14th or 15th century - meaning that even if it is authentic, it is a copy of the original. Still, the Bering Straight was not discovered until the mid-18th century - three hundred years after the document was made. The ink on the map, however, has not been tested - meaning it could have been forged after the sheepskin was created. Gunnar Thompson, a controversial historian and the author of MarcoPoloinSeattle.com, also studied the documents in depth and argues that the landmarks that Polo laid out match up with remarkable accuracy to Chinese maps that date from before Polo's time - as well as maps that came after. Marco Polo was a 13th century Italian merchant from Venice. And while he wasn't the first European trader to travel into China, his detailed account of his journey, Book of the Marvels of the World or The Travels of Marco Polo, made him the most famous. His tales of traveling the Silk Road through Eurasia and befriending the Mongol emperor of China Kublai Kahn captivated Europe and helped fuel the Western obsession with trading with the East. Christopher Columbus set sail for India in 1492 after having been inspired by his writing. At age 17, Polo set off with his father and uncle - both Venetian merchants who grew wealthy trading with the east - on a journey to China. They returned 24 years later with a host of treasures and incredible tales. The three Polos traveled over-land for three and a half years before reaching Kublai Kahn in China. The Kahn, one of the most powerful emperors to ever rule China, had met Polo's brother and uncle on a previous voyage. They were the first Western men the Kahn had ever seen. In China, the Polo became close the the Khan - even carrying out missions across China and as far away as Burma as his emissary. In 1292, the three Polo left China and traveled back to Italy - returning in 1295. When he arrived in Venice, to find the city-state at war with the Republic of Genoa. He took up arms and was captured in 1296 following a naval battle. From a Genovesi, he dictated the tail of his travels to his cellmate, who wrote them down into what later became The Travels of Marco Polo. Polo was released in 1299 and married. He had two daughters and died at age 69. He says that distortions in how the map is drawn - for example, the Bering Straight appears as a north-south passage and not an east-west passage - can be chalked up to magnetic distortions in Polo's compass readings that occur that close to the North Pole. Calculating for the distortions shown on Polo's map, Thompson estimates that Polo made it all the way around Alaska and down to British Columbia before turning back. Thompson, who described himself as a 'history detective,' posits that Polo even alluded to a 'Land of Darkness' beyond the plains of Mongolia, in the Travels of Margo Polo. He posits that Polo was referring to Alaska. Thompson suggests that Polo's exploration could have been sent on a mission by Kublai Khan - the Mongol ruler of China whom Polo befriended. Polo was meant to explore the far reaches of the empire in order to determine the source of furs, precious stones, gold, perfumes and dyes that were being imported into the Yuan Dynasty in China.

"A rare woolly mammoth skeleton has been sold at auction for £150,000 ($236,000). It is one of the best preserved skeletons of such an Ice Age beast ever found, and measures an incredible 11.4ft (3.5 metres) high and 18ft (5.5 metres) long . The 500,000-year-old specimen called Monty was bought by an unnamed private buyer. Scroll down for video . The mammoth, dubbed Monty, (pictured) was found after spending around 100,000 years under the ice in Siberia, and was put up for auction by Summers Place Auctions in Billingshurst, West Sussex. The beast is thought to have weighed up to six tons and was sold to a private buyer £150,000 ($236,000) Monty was found after spending around 100,000 years under the ice in Siberia, and was put up for auction by Summers Place Auctions in Billingshurst, West Sussex. The beast is thought to have weighed up to six tonnes. Curator Errol Fullor said it was unusual for a nearly complete skeleton to come on the market for sale. The skeleton had been part of a private collection in Eastern Europe, but had not been assembled and mounted until it was prepared for auction. The skeleton had been part of a private collection in Eastern Europe, but had not been assembled and mounted until it was prepared for auction. It is one of the best preserved skeletons of such an Ice Age beast and measures incredible 11.4ft (3.5 metres) high and 18ft (5.5 metres) long . Curator Errol Fullor said it was unusual for a nearly complete skeleton to come on the market for sale. The inside curve of the tusks is approximately 8ft (2.4 metres) and the specimen is thought to be a male . Monty was expected to sell for up to for £250,000 ($409,000). 'Imagine the mammoth covered in fur - long fur on top with a shorter undercoat - and although quite similar to today's elephant, it had smaller ears and a shorter tail to minimise frostbite and heat loss, so it was well adapted for the ice age,' said Mr Fullor. 'Its habitat was the mammoth steppe, stretching across northern Eurasia and North America, so its diet was mainly grass and sedges, which explains why it only had four molar teeth, and also stunning long, curved tusks.' The woolly mammoth is thought to be a male. James Rylands, of Summers Place Auctions, said: 'What's exceptional about this one is it's more or less complete with two magnificent tusks. There are one or two toes missing. The woolly mammoth co-existed with early humans, who hunted them for food and used their bones and tusks for making art. 'To the best of my knowledge, I don't think there has been one sold at auction, certainly not in the UK and I don't think in Europe, so it's a first in that respect,' said auctioneer James Rylands . Back from the dead? Scientists hope to bring woolly mammoths back from extinction . Woolly mammoths could be brought back from extinction after a preserved body of one of the ancient animals was found frozen in the snowy wastes of Siberia, scientists hope. The mammoth, which took its last steps around 40,000 years ago, is in such good condition that biologists believe they may be able to clone the creature. An autopsy of the Ice Age beast, which has been nicknamed Buttercup by scientists, will be shown in a documentary later this month. The Channel 4 programme will also examine pioneering work on cloning the woolly mammoth, which is taking place in South Korea and the US. Scientists hope that, eventually, they will be able to reintroduce the huge creatures back into the wild, tens of thousands of years after they became extinct. Insung Hwang, a South Korean geneticist, told the Independent: 'Bringing back the mammoth either through cloning or genetic engineering would be an extremely long process. We're trying hard to make this possible within our generation.' That's why we have to start discussing the implications now. Some of our colleagues are still working on analysing the genome from Buttercup's specimen. This is a long and complicated process that is unlikely to be finished anytime in the near future.' 'It looks very impressive, the inside curve of the tusks is about 8ft (2.4 metres). It's bigger than an elephant.' The woolly mammoth co-existed with early humans, who hunted them for food and used their bones and tusks for making art. 'To the best of my knowledge, I don't think there has been one sold at auction, certainly not in the UK and I don't think in Europe, so it's a first in that respect,' said Mr Rylands. 'It's not like a number 14 bus, there isn't going to be another one coming along.' Last year, a diplodocus skeleton sold at auction for more than £400,000 ($654,000).

"While we eat vegetables and fish, all slathered in olive oil, hoping to benefit from the healthy Mediterranean diet, the Japanese way of life is attracting the attention of research scientists studying health and longevity. Those who live on the East Asian islands have the longest life expectancy, at 82.5 years compared to our 80, and  the highest proportion of centenarians, including Misao Okawa, 116, perhaps the oldest person in the world. Their obesity rate is just 3.5 per cent, compared to a quarter of Britons. Rates of breast cancer, prostate cancer and heart disease in Japan are also much lower than those in the UK. Here, experts reveal the Japanese habits that can help you live to 100... Chop it up: Give your lifestyle an Oriental twist by following the Japanese way . DITCH DESSERT . THE HEALTHY HABIT ‘In Japan people tend to finish off meals with green tea or fruit rather than a pudding,’ says Dr Craig Wilcox. ‘Dessert is something to be taken with coffee in the afternoon, if at all, and the portions are much smaller than in the West.’ THE THEORY Increasing evidence has linked sugar to weight gain, and related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. THE EVIDENCE Japanese people consume on average 48.8g sugar per day, compared with the British who get through 100.4g a day, according to recent statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. SWAP SALAD FOR SEAWEED . THE HEALTHY HABIT Experts link Japanese health and longevity to a diet low in fat and high in fruit and sea vegetables such as seaweed. THE THEORY Seaweed is packed with disease-fighting antioxidants and can help you to lose weight. THE EVIDENCE In March, scientists at Newcastle University reported that alginate, a compound found in seaweed, stops the body absorbing fat. Their study showed that a fourfold increase in intake of alginate boosted suppression of fat digestion  by 75 per cent. LIVE LIKE THE JAPANESE If you want to try seaweed, buy wakame flakes,  available at health- food stores, soak in water for five minutes and add to salads. Eating habits: By practicing 'hara hachi bu' - stop when you are 80 per cent full - and eating sushi, which has omega 3 rich fish and  sea vegetables such as seaweed, you could lengthen your life . STOP BEFORE YOU'RE FULL . THE HEALTHY HABIT The remote Japanese island of Okinawa has the highest proportion of centenarians in the world, and some credit this to the practice of ‘hara hachi bu’ – eat until you’re eight-tenths full. THE THEORY If you stop before you’re full, and wait, you’ll find you don’t need those last few mouthfuls after all, so you’ll eat less, staying slim and healthy. THE EVIDENCE This theory is based on the delay between the stomach becoming full and the brain receiving this signal, which experts agree takes 20 minutes – which means many of us, by eating too quickly, end up having more than we need. While the British love  ‘a clean plate’, evidence  shows calorie restriction helps to maintain a healthy weight, and protect against diseases such as heart disease and cancer. A 20-year study on monkeys showed that those whose calorie intake was restricted by 30 per cent had longer life spans and showed slower ageing of the brain. LIVE LIKE THE JAPANESE Have dainty portion sizes and you’ll be less likely to overeat, says Naomi Moriyama, author of Japanese Women Don’t Get  Old Or Fat. ‘The Japanese daily calorie intake is ten per cent less than in the UK. That’s because the food pattern is more filling, and food is served on much smaller plates.’ SAVOUR SUSHI (BUT HOLD THE SOY SAUCE) THE HEALTHY HABIT Sushi is a good source of omega 3 fatty acids, important for brain and heart health. The Japanese eat 80g to 100g of fish every day, while the British struggle to eat one portion of oily fish a week. THE THEORY ‘Sushi is a great source of omega 3 fatty acids, and it’s also a healthy way to eat protein because you’re not accompanying it with saturated fat as you do in a Western diet,’ says Dr Craig Wilcox of the Okinawa Research Center for Longevity Science. THE EVIDENCE Research has found that Japan’s low rate of heart disease was down to their enjoyment of fish and seafood. Japanese men had less cholesterol in their arteries than US men,  even though they had similar blood-pressure readings and higher rates of smoking. A high fish diet may have a protective effect against artery-clogging. LIVE LIKE THE JAPANESE Have sushi or oily fish at least once a week, but Dr Wilcox warns not  to cover it in soy sauce, or it becomes very high in salt. Traditional movement: By walking to work and practicing Tai Chi, the Japanese people improve fitness and psychological well--being . WALK TO WORK . THE HEALTHY HABIT Driving  is expensive in Japan, so many people rely on public transport and walking. ‘One of the  biggest health secrets of the Japanese lifestyle is walking,’ says Naomi Moriyama. ‘People walk two or three times per day on average, and spend radically less time in cars.’ THE THEORY Going places on foot results in a daily dose of at least 30 to 60 minutes of routine, incidental exercise, which gives a very powerful health boost. THE EVIDENCE Walking for two-and-a-half hours a week could add seven years to your life, Harvard University researchers reported in 2012. They reviewed six long-term studies and found that even 75 minutes of brisk walking could extend life by almost two years. LIVE LIKE THE JAPANESE Incorporate walking into your daily routine and think about whether you really need to drive, says Moriyama. ‘Most people can find a way to briskly walk for 30 minutes a day.’ BALANCE YOUR LIFE . THE HEALTHY HABIT It’s common to see groups of adults practising tai chi in parks in Japan. The ancient Chinese martial art combines deep breathing and very slow, graceful movements. THE THEORY Tai chi is considered a good form of exercise for older people because of the minimal impact on the joints. It’s  also thought to be good for improving balance and mobility and reducing stress. THE EVIDENCE A 2011 study reviewed a number of studies on tai chi and concluded  that the practice can prevent falls by improving balance, and that it is also good for psychological wellbeing.

Know the score: Japanese are required to have annual health checks . THE HEALTHY HABIT For centuries, the Japanese have been eating fermented or pickled vegetables. THE THEORY The vegetables are pre-digested by bacteria, which make their nutrients easier for the body to absorb, and stimulate the growth of ‘good’ bacteria in the gut. THE EVIDENCE Research shows this healthy gut bacteria is linked to the immune system – 80 per cent of our immune cells are in the gut. Fermented vegetables provide a rich source of  lactic acid bacteria which are thought to be the most useful for gut health. LIVE LIKE THE JAPANESE Research shows suguki, a pickled turnip, could protect against flu. Miso is also made from fermented soy beans. TOFU BEATS MENOPAUSE . THE HEALTHY HABIT Amazingly, there is no word for ‘hot flushes’ in Japan and  studies show that women there suffer much less during the menopause than women in the West. Why? Some experts suggest it’s down to their high intake of soy beans and soy foods, such as tofu. THE THEORY Soy foods contain isoflavones, which mimic the effect of oestrogen, the hormone that naturally falls in women in middle age. THE EVIDENCE In 2012, a major review on the subject found  that two daily servings of soy can reduce the frequency and severity of hot flushes by 26 per cent, compared with a placebo. The paper, published in Menopause: The Journal Of  The North American Menopause Association, reviewed 19 previous studies which looked  at a total of 1,200 women. Melissa Melby, a medical anthropologist at the University of Delaware and co-author of the study, said the effect is probably greater in Japanese women who have eaten soy products from birth. ‘But if you’re 50 and you’ve never touched soy, it’s not too late,’ she added. ‘We’ve found that it still helps.’ LIVE LIKE THE JAPANESE ‘In Japan they have tofu a couple of times a week,’ says nutritionist Marlene Watson-Tara. ‘It’s  best to get soy beans in this fermented form rather than a soya burger, as it’s much more easily digested.’ Try tofu in stir fries or Asian broths and stews. KNOW YOUR NUMBERS . THE HEALTHY HABIT Everyone in Japan is strongly encouraged to attend a free annual health check. Employers are charged with ensuring that their workers do not  gain weight. THE THEORY Gerontologist Dr Craig Wilcox says Japanese people are encouraged to be health-conscious, to eat well, take regular exercise and listen to the body. ‘There’s a sense of responsibility to take care of yourself as you get older – you don’t want to be a nuisance so you stay healthy.’ THE EVIDENCE A study in The Lancet concluded that a major reason for Japan’s excellent life expectancy was heavy government investment in the public healthcare system, free annual health checks, and a sense of health-consciousness among its citizens. Increasingly, doctors are stressing that changes in lifestyles are the key to reducing disease, death and the strain on the NHS.

"Covered in flour, they clamber from a foreign lorry – to the amazement of other motorists on a busy motorway. This is the moment that at least nine suspected illegal immigrants emerged from their hiding place after smuggling themselves into the UK. The gang brazenly strolled off into the English countryside. And although all were caught within minutes, almost half were immediately set free. They were even taken to a hostel, given free accommodation and told how to apply for asylum and benefits. Any lengths: One man, watched on by his accomplice, emerges from the lorry covered in flour . The graphic illustration of how Britain remains a soft touch for migrants occurred on the M26 in Kent this week. And it seems it was not a rare event. Kent Police say that for the past two years they have received on average one report a day relating to clandestine immigration. The incident happened near the junction with the M25, as rush-hour traffic slowed to a crawl, and was photographed by a Daily Mail reader. The immigrants opened the hatch in the top of the German food tanker, which had apparently just arrived from France via the Channel Tunnel and was parked on the hard shoulder of the motorway. They emerged one by one, then jumped down on to the ground in a shower of dust. Several witnesses called police, while the tanker driver was also apparently on the phone to the authorities as his stowaway passengers fled. One caller told officers the flour-covered Middle Eastern fugitives would be easy to spot as they all ‘looked like Casper the Friendly Ghost’. They were picked up within the hour at the nearby village of Otford. But after Kent Police handed the nine men over to the Border Agency, four were allowed to go free. Emerging: The immigrants emerging from the top of a German registered tanker in a layby on the M20 . The other five remain in detention ‘pending removal from the UK’ but may yet wage legal bids to stay.It is believed the group had sneaked into the tanker – assumed to have been used previously for transporting flour or other foodstuffs – somewhere in France before being brought to England without the knowledge of the driver. Lorry drivers face heavy fines for bringing illegals into the country, and the Border Agency – under fire for its failure to tackle unauthorised immigration – claims to have tightened security checks for stowaways, with specialist equipment to detect body heat or breath. But it seems the flow of people sneaking in continues regardless. The Daily Mail reader who photographed the gang said: ‘I was just near the M25 when I saw this German lorry on the hard shoulder. The driver was talking on his mobile. Maybe he heard something inside his tanker, so stopped. ‘As I went past the tanker, I saw these people start coming out of the hatch on top. They were all covered in this white stuff that looked like flour, but seemed to be from the Middle East. They were a bit unshaven and shaggy. ‘They were not running across the fields, just walking slowly and smiling. I think they were happy because they managed to cross the border.’ Last night Kent Police said: ‘We were called at around 8.15am on Tuesday by several members of the public who reported seeing a group of men getting off a lorry on the westbound M26, near to where it joins the M25. The men were on foot, described as being covered in a white, flour-like powder. ‘Officers, assisted by sightings by members of the public, arrested nine men in the Sevenoaks area on suspicion of entering the country illegally. They have been taken to Dover and handed over to the UK Border Agency.’ The Border Agency said: ‘Immigration Enforcement officials were contacted by Kent Police after they attended an incident on the M26 on Tuesday. ‘Nine men – four Syrians, two Iranians, an Egyptian, an Iraqi and a Palestinian – were arrested at the scene on suspicion of immigration offences.’ But it admitted: ‘Four of the men – two Syrians, an Egyptian and an Iranian – have since been released on immigration bail while their cases are considered by the Home Office. Under fire: The fact that four of the immigrants are now being housed and expected to get benefits will see the Border Agency come in for more criticism . ‘If they are found to have no right to remain in the UK they will face removal. The other men remain in immigration detention pending their removal from the UK.’ The Home Office said: ‘When suspected illegal immigrants found on lorries are arrested by police, we respond quickly. ‘We work closely with police to tackle illegal immigration. Where someone is found to have no legal right to remain in the UK we will take action to remove them.’ Last night a Home Office spokesman refused to discuss the nine arrivals in detail but suggested that the four who were set free would have been given transport to a hostel where they would be housed rent-free. They would be given information on how to apply for benefits for asylum seekers, which would start with cash payments of £36 a week, and be told to check in regularly to dissuade them from absconding again. The Home Office spokesman claimed to have no figures for the number of clandestine arrivals caught in Kent – saying immigration control centres were in France and Belgium, not England.","Nine suspected illegal immigrants emerge from their hiding place - from lorry on the M26 .

"A singing doctor has been handed £8,000 of taxpayers' money to make a music video in which he tells people how to use their inhalers. Dr Tapas Mukherjee, who is based at Leicester Royal Infirmary, was praised two years ago for his home-made video, 'Breakfast at Glenfield' - a take on Deep Blue Something's Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which explained guidelines for treating asthma patients. He has now been given a NHS grant to pay for a professional film crew to create a new video to help asthma patients use their inhalers properly. But the Taxpayers' Alliance has labelled the grant 'nonsense', claiming that the funds could be put to better use at a time when the NHS is facing budget freezes. Scroll down for video . 'Singing doctor' Tapas Mukherjee has been awarded an £8,000 grant by the NHS to produce a music video advising asthma sufferers on how to use their inhalers. He is pictured in a previous video he funded himself . Dr Mukherjee, 33, is keeping details of the new song under wraps until it is broadcast next year. He said: 'The aim will be to help educate people about when and how to use inhalers. 'If it helps to change people's behaviour it could lead to fewer hospital admissions and the cost of the project could easily be recovered. 'Research shows that there is a lack of awareness among people as to when and how to use their inhaler. 'The next logical step, having made a video aimed at staff was to create a video to show patients how to manage their condition.' For his previous video, Dr Mukherjee used his mobile phone, a home computer and help from this friends to create what became a YouTube hit. The grant was awarded after Dr Mukherjee was praised for creating a YouTube video about asthma guidelines . The doctor insists the video could cut the number of people going to their doctors or hospital and so will recoup the funding invested in it . He took the lyrics from Breakfast at Tiffany's by Deep Blue Something and turned it into Breakfast at Glenfield, the name of a Leicester hospital, to explain the guidelines medics should follow in treating asthma patients. The video won the British Thoracic Society Innovation in Education Award 2012 and the NHS Expo/Network Casebook II Innovation Award 2013. Although the stars of his new video are all staff at Leicester's hospitals, a professional film crew has been hired to shoot it. The project was one of only 46 out of a total of 600 applications which received a share of a £2.5million NHS England fund to improve care. Dr Mukherjee said: 'This video is a little more serious and while I want it to include humour I don't want to offend anyone and I don't want the video to be patronising. 'We are aiming for hundreds of thousands of views. The last video showed me there was an appetite for this sort of thing.' The doctor won two awards for his previous video, which he made with his mobile phone and home computer . A scene from Dr Mukherjee's previous video. Campaigners have hit out at the funding of his latest project . Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said: 'Once again frontline clinicians and NHS managers are proving that, given the chance, the NHS can be one of the most innovative health services in the world.' But Andy Silvester, Campaign Manager for the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will be baffled that, with finances so tight, the NHS is dishing out recording contracts to its own staff. 'While Dr Mukherjee may well have a delightful singing voice, it's nonsense to prioritise a grant like this when front-line staff are feeling the pinch of a necessary pay-freeze. 'The NHS must cut out this kind of waste, as well as removing layers of middle-management and unnecessary bureaucracy, if it is to remain sustainable as our population ages.'","Doctor was praised for making self-funded asthma guidelines music video .

'As they leave, I said, 'Have a good day, God bless you,' she told CBS 2's Christine Sloan earlier this month. 'He told me he wanted to talk to me, that I couldn't say, 'God bless you,' anymore to customers because somebody might get offended,' Fernandez told CBS 2. 'It does say, 'Provide customer service, smile' – it does say all that,' Fernandez said. 'But it does not say in any line, 'Do not say, 'God bless you.' 'By saying 'God bless you,' she's expressing herself as a Christian,' her lawyer, Greg Noble, said. 'And if an employer is going to restrain her ability to express herself in that way, not say something based on her religious belief, not disrupting the workplace, that's our concern.'

"Rapidly freezing saltwater could provide the spark needed for life to flourish on icy worlds. This is according to a Nasa-led research team that measured the electric potential in fast-freezing salty ice. During a process known as the Workman-Reynolds Effect (WRE), they discovered ions take on a negative or positive charge at the boundary between ice and water. During a process known as the Workman-Reynolds Effect (WRE), scientists discovered ions take on a negative or positive charge at the boundary between ice and water. Pictured is glacial ice in the Antarctic . They also found that the electrical potential created by this process could reach up to 230 volts - the same voltage supplied by many residential mains systems. This could lead to significant hydrogen and oxygen gas production, key ingredients for life, according to a report by Andrew Williams in Astrobiology magazine. When a dilute solution of certain salts freezes rapidly, a potential electrical difference is created between the solid and liquid phases. For some salts, the ice receives a negative charge, for others, positive. Researchers have found this electrical potential could reach up to 230 volts – the same voltage supplied by many residential mains systems. This mechanism was thought to play a role in the charging of thunderstorms. Now scientists believe it could help trigger significant hydrogen and oxygen gas production, key ingredients for life, on icy planets. The findings may have huge significance in the search for life on Jupiter's moon, Europa. Europa's surface contains a significant amount of magnesium sulphate salts that could have formed by oxidation of a mineral originating from the ocean below. Scientists believe that what can be observed on the surface of Europa may reflect what is underneath its surface. Galileo missions between 1989 to 2003, which studied Jupiter and its moons, suggests there is a chemical exchange between the ocean and surface. If the WRE process was to occur over a long period of time, the amount of oxygen produced 'would be substantial enough to support habitation,' according to Travis Johnson, a geosciences student at the University of Colorado at Boulder. 'It may provide enough electric potential to drive initial chemical reactions that are essential to the production of life,' he told Astrobiology magazine. As well as cycling of material between the ocean and ice shell, it is believed that geysers spurting out of Jupiter's moon may be an opportunity to spot alien life originating beneath the surface. Europa's surface (pictured) contains a significant amount of magnesium sulphate salts. Scientists believe that what can be observed on the surface of Europa may reflect what is underneath its surface . This was based on observations by the Hubble Space Telescope in December 2013 that saw water vapour being ejected from the moon, lending evidence to the existence of jets. In September, Jupiter's moon Europa has been found to have tectonic activity like Earth. This was the first time this specific type of geological activity has been observed in the solar system other than on our planet.","Nasa-led research team has measured electrical potential in salty ice .

"A family has been forced out of their country club home after 6,000 venomous spiders moved in. Fumigators are now pumping poisonous gas into the house in the upscale neighborhood of Weldon Spring, Missouri in an attempt to kill the brown recluse spiders, which have been there for at least seven years. After the couple, Brian and Susan Trost, moved out of the home  and launched multiple lawsuits against the former owners and insurance companies, the home went into foreclosure. The 2,400-square-foot, four-bedroom property, which has prime views across the Whitmoor Country Club, never sold - but McCarthy Pest Control believes they can finally take care of the problem. Scroll down for video . Final hope: Workers from McCarthy Pest Control cover a house in Dardenne Prairie, Missouri with a tarp in preparation for fumigating the home to get rid of thousands of brown recluse spiders . Extreme: They will use sulfuryl fluoride gas to try to kill the spiders that have been there for seven years . This week, workers used nine tarps measuring 15,000 square feet to cover the home before filling it with sulfuryl fluoride gas that permeated the walls to kill the spiders and their eggs. 'There'll be nothing alive in there after this,' president Tim McCarthy told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. The Trosts, who didn't notice any spiders at the home when they looked around, bought it in October 2007 for $450,000. But when they moved in, Mrs Trost immediately noticed large webs around lights and in the basement - but assumed the house just needed to be cleaned thoroughly, the Post-Dispatch reported. Forced out: Susan and Brian Trost bought the home, pictured, for $450,000 in 2007 but quickly realized it had been infested with thousands of spiders. No traps or fumigating would kill the spiders . Terrifying: Denny McCarthy, whose son runs the pest control business, points out the violin design on the back of a brown recluse spider painted on the side of truck. The brown recluse spiders can bite . But as they settled into the home, they realized the home was infested. She found them in blinds, ceilings, fireplaces, lights - and one even dropped from the ceiling as she was in the shower. 'It was shortly after we moved in they started bleeding out of the walls,' Trost told KMOV of the spiders. They captured one of the spiders, which was about half the size of a dollar, and looked it up on the internet and discovered that it was a brown recluse. The spiders, which have a distinctive violin shape on their backs, can bite and cause pain, swelling, itching, nausea and, in extreme cases, organ failure and even death. Experts still do not know why the spiders chose the Trosts' home, which was built in 1988, over an older home. Luxury: The house is in a desirable spot overlooking the fourth hole at Whitmoor Country Club . Going in: A photograph shows the poison gas to be used by McCarthy Pest Control to fumigate the home . There is often no reason why they choose one place over another; neighbors near the Missouri house said they had never seen any of the spiders in their home, the Post-Dispatch reported. After Mrs Trost found out what she was dealing with, a pest control company sprayed the home inside and out, put down traps and sprayed behind the dry wall - but nothing would get rid of them. Determined: Company owner Tim McCarthy, seen carrying clamps, believes he can beat the spiders . One expert, a biology professor at the University of Kansas, estimated there were between 4,500 and 6,000 spiders inside the home - and that was just during winter. In 2008, they filed a civil lawsuit against the previous owners for failing to disclose the problem, as well as a claim with their insurance company. The previous owners said they had never seen the spiders - and their lawyer suggested the Trosts had brought them with them on their furniture - but the jury in the civil trial voted in the couple's favor and awarded them $472,110. They have since filed a lawsuit against their insurers, State Farm, for failing to pay claims related to the spider damage. The company claims that the spiders do not amount to physical damage in the home. The family eventually moved out, fearing the safety of their four children. When they left, the wrapped their furniture and left it outside in freezing temperatures to kill any spiders that were hanging on. Fannie Mae now owns the home. Tim McCarthy, the exterminator, contacted the company to rid the home of the spiders. McCarthy's treatment costs between $5,000 and $30,000, depending on the size of the home, and have had successful results in other houses. He explained that they need something stronger than pesticides for spiders because their feet do not absorb substances on the ground. Venomous: The spiders can cause pain and swelling . Brown recluse spiders are one of only two potentially harmful spiders in Missouri (the other is the black widow). the venom in the brown recluse is more potent than that of a rattlesnake - although it causes less damage because it injects only small quantities. The venom is toxic to cells and tissues and can cause tissue to die. Bites are uncommon. Instead, they usually only bite when they are pressed against for skin - for example, when they are living inside clothing that is then put on. The bites are often not felt immediately but itching can develop within hours and they can be serious. But sometimes, they can cause lesions, as well as nausea, vomiting, joint pain and fever in young children, the elderly or the infirm. In very rare occasions, they can cause organ damage or even kill. The spiders measure between six and 22 mm but can grow larger. They are usually light-colored brown and recognizable by a darker patch that looks like a violin, with the neck of the violin pointing down the spider's back. They generally build their webs in dry areas that will not be disturbed, including sheds, closets and cellars, and inside houses they can be found near cardboard or inside stored clothing.","Brian and Susan Trost moved into the four-bedroom home in Weldon Spring, Missouri in 2007 and quickly realized it was infested .

"More than 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed across the globe each day, and its likely that many taste bitter. Now, a new study suggests that coffee fans can make their drink taste sweeter by simply swapping the colour of their cup. Scientists claim that blue and glass mugs, which are popular in some coffee shops, reduce a coffee’s bitterness, without any need for sugar. A study suggests that coffee fans can make their drink taste sweeter by swapping the colour of their cup. It claimed that blue and glass mugs, which are popular in some coffee shops, reduce a coffee’s bitterness, without resorting to sugar. While coffee tastes the most bitter in white cups (pictured) Researchers from Federation University Australia and the University of Oxford set out to prove whether a barista’s claim - that coffee drunk from a white cups tastes bitter - was true. They used 36 volunteers and three different coloured cups - blue, white and transparent glass - to investigate the claim. In one experiment, the white mug enhanced the rated ‘intensity’ of the coffee flavour relative to the transparent mug, according to the study published in the journal Flavour. Researchers from Federation University Australia and the University of Oxford set out to prove whether a barista’s claim, that coffee drunk from a white cups tastes bitter, is true. They used 36 volunteers and three different coloured cups - blue, white and transparent glass (pictured) - to investigate the claim . The scientists think the colour brown may be associated with bitterness. This means that coffee in a white cup appears the brownest, and therefore the least sweet. Dutch psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis previously suggested that because of the use of the word ‘strong’ in advertising, consumers often confuse a coffee’s strength or intensity with its bitterness. In the study, the scientists found a trend in bitterness ratings that mirrored intensity ratings. Then, in a second experiment, coffee consumed from the white cup was found to taste less sweet when compared to the other coloured mugs. While the blue cup made the coffee taste the sweetest. The scientists believe that the colour brown may be associated with bitterness so that coffee in a white cup appears the brownest. ‘Our study clearly shows that the colour of a mug does influence the perceived taste and flavour of coffee,’ lead author Dr George Doorn of Federation University Australia, wrote in an article for The Conversation. ‘The effect of the colour of the mug on the flavour of the coffee reported here suggests that café owners, baristas, as well as crockery manufacturers should carefully consider the colour of their mugs,’ he said. ‘The potential effects may spell the difference between a one-time purchase and a return customer.’ The idea that colour can alter the taste of food and drink is not new. A study published last year revealed that red, strawberry-flavoured mousse served on a white plate was rated as 10 per cent sweeter and 15 per cent more flavoursome than the same food presented on a black plate.","Researchers from Federation University Australia and the University of Oxford asked volunteers to drink coffee from different coloured cups .

"A new way of measuring precise distances to galaxies tens of millions of light years away has been developed - using a distant galaxy dubbed the Eye of Sauron. Researchers accurately measured the distance to the galaxy, formally known as NGC 4151, by comparing the physical size of the dust ring around its black hole with the perceived sized seen from Earth. And the galaxy - with a distance now known to be 62 million light-years - can be used as a 'cosmic marker' in the universe to work out the distance to other celestial objects. Scroll down for video . Scientists have worked out the distance to NGC 4151 (dubbed Eye of Sauron), 62million-light-years, and it can now be used as a distance marker in the universe. Powerful X-rays generated by a super-massive black hole produced the bright blue 'pupil' of the eye, while the red halo around the pupil is made up of hydrogen atoms . One of the major problems in astronomy is measuring very large distances in the universe. The current, most common methods measure relative distances by using markers known as 'standard candles' - which are stars with a known luminosity whose distance can be measured. But now research from the University of Southampton and Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark has demonstrated that precise distances can be measured using supermassive black holes. By combining the light from the two 10-meter Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea on Hawaii using a method called interferometry, the scientists could achieve an effective resolution equivalent to a telescope with a perfect 85-metre diameter mirror. This provides very high resolution - a hundred times better resolution than the Hubble Space Telescope - and allows them to measure the angle the dust ring of the Eye of Sauron made in the sky. By now combining data about the observed size of the dust ring on the sky with the known physical size of 30 light days, the distance from the Earth can be calculated by using simple geometry. 'We calculated the distance to be 62 million light-years,' said Dr Darach Watson from the Niels Bohr Institute, who was involved in the research. 'The previous calculations based on redshift [a change in the wavelength of the light due to the velocity of the object away from us] were between 13 million and 95 million light-years, so we have gone from a great deal of uncertainty to now being able to determine the precise distance. 'This is very significant for astronomical calculations of cosmic scale distances.' Dr Sebastian Hoenig, from the University of Southampton, created the method which is similar to what land surveyors use on Earth. It works by measuring the physical and angular, or 'apparent', size of a standard ruler in the galaxy, to calibrate the distance from this information. The research, which is published in the journal Nature, was used to identify the accurate distance of the 'nearby' NGC 4151 galaxy, which wasn't previously known. The galaxy NGC 4151, which is dubbed the Eye of Sauron by astronomers for its similarity to the film's depiction of the eye of the character in The Lord Of The Rings, is important for accurately measuring black hole masses. Indeed, as in the famous saga, a ring plays a crucial role in this new measurement. All big galaxies in the universe host a supermassive black hole in their centre and, in about a tenth of all galaxies, these supermassive black holes are growing by swallowing huge amounts of gas and dust from their surrounding environments. In this process, the material heats up and becomes very bright - becoming the most energetic sources of emission in the universe known as active galactic nuclei (AGN). The hot dust forms a ring around the supermassive black hole and emits infrared radiation, which the researchers used as the ruler. However, the apparent size of this ring is so small that the observations were carried out using infrared interferometry. This involved combining the twin 33ft (10 metres) telescopes of the WM Keck Observatory in Hawaii  to achieve the resolution power of a 280ft (85 metres) telescope. The galaxy NGC 4151 is dubbed the Eye of Sauron by astronomers for its similarity to the film's depiction of the eye of the character in The Lord Of The Rings (shown), and it is important for accurately measuring black hole masses. Indeed, as in the famous saga, a ring plays a crucial role in this new measurement . The measurement was made using the two 33ft (10 metres) Keck telescopes (shown) on Mauna Kea on Hawaii via a method called interferometry. This involved combining the two telescopes to get a resolution power equivalent to a 280ft (85 metres) telescope . To measure the physical size of the dusty ring, the researchers measured the time delay between the emission of light from very close to the black hole and the infrared emission. This delay is the distance the light has to travel (at the speed-of-light) from close to the black hole out to the hot dust. By combining this physical size of the dust ring with the apparent size measured with the data from the Keck interferometer, the researchers were able to determine a distance to the galaxy . Recently reported distances ranged from 13 million to 95 million light-years, but using this new method the researchers now know the galaxy is 62 milion light-years from Earth. When the gas falls in towards the black hole, it is heated up and emits ultraviolet radiation, which in turn heats up the surrounding dust cloud. Using telescopes on Earth, scientists measured the time difference between the light from the black hole and the light from the dust cloud, 30 days, to work out its distance . Dr Hoenig said: 'One of the key findings is that the distance determined in this new fashion is quite precise - with only about 10 per cent uncertainty. 'In fact, if the current result for NGC 4151 holds for other objects, it can potentially beat any other current methods to reach the same precision to determine distances for remote galaxies directly based on simple geometrical principles. 'Moreover, it can be readily used on many more sources than the current most precise method.' 'Such distances are key in pinning down the cosmological parameters that characterise our universe or for accurately measuring black hole masses. 'Indeed, NGC 4151 is a crucial anchor to calibrate various techniques to estimate black hole masses. Our new distance implies that these masses may have been systematically underestimated by 40 per cent.' Dr Hoenig, together with colleagues in Denmark and Japan, is currently setting up a new programme to extend their work to establish precise distances to a dozen galaxies in this new way and use them to constrain cosmological parameters to within a few per cent. In combination with other measurements, this will provide a better understanding of the history of expansion of our universe.","Scientist devised a new method to measure distances in the universe .

"A top High Street fashion chain is investigating how two shoppers found labels sewn into summer dresses referring to 'sweatshops conditions' and 'exhausting hours.' The two women were shocked at finding the hand-made labels sewn into bargain tops bought from the same Primark store. However it is unknown when the labels were added to the garments. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Jones 21, who has found the second label sewn into a Primark product referring to poor working conditions . Rebecca Gallagher, 25, spotted a label reading: 'Forced to work exhausting hours' next to the washing instruction of her bargain top. And a second shopper Rebecca Williams, 21, revealed how she found another label reading: 'Degrading sweatshop conditions'. The two women - who do not know each other - bought their £10 summer dresses from the same Primark store in Swansea, South Wales. Rebecca Jones 21, found the second label sewn into a Primark dress from the store in Swansea . It comes after the discount fashion retailers have been criticised over working conditions of workers abroad - but Primark insists it has a strict code of ethics. Mother-to-be Miss Williams said: 'I was really shocked when I saw the label saying it was degrading sweatshop conditions. 'I used to shop a lot at Primark but not so much now. The label has made me think about how my clothes are made. 'I have no idea who made the label or how it go it there - but it does make you think.' Miss Williams, of Porthcawl, South Wales, said she tweeted a photograph of the label to Primark when she bought the blue dress from last year’s summer range. She said: 'I tried to ring them as well but I was put on hold forever and then it just went dead. 'But then I heard about the other label from the same shop. I think Primark should get to the bottom of it.' Fellow shopper Miss Gallagher, 25, spotted the handmade label sewn into the multi-coloured top from discount store Primark. She had vowed never to wear it again because fearing it was made by a tired worker toiling in a foreign sweatshop. Rebecca Gallagher bought a top from Primark, Swansea only to discover this note stitched in the hem . Miss Gallagher, of Swansea, said: 'I was amazed when I checked for the washing instructions and spotted this label. 'It was stitched by hand to say “Forced to work exhausting hours” and sewn in with the other normal labels. 'To be honest I’ve never really thought much about how the clothes are made. 'But this really made me think about how we get our cheap fashion. 'I dread to think that my summer top may be made by some exhausted person toiling away for hours in some sweatshop abroad.' The label reading “Forced to work exhausting hours” was stitched into the other labels giving Primark addresses in Spain and Ireland along with washinginstructions. A shopper was stunned when she discovered an SOS letter from a Chinese sweatshop worker - in the pocket of her Primark jeans. Shocked Karen Wisinska, 28, brought the £10 trousers from the budget chain store in Belfast. She later found the identity card of a man and a letter claiming he was 'working his fingers to the bone' and being fed 'worse than a dog or cat'. Headlined ‘SOS SOS SOS’ with the main text in Mandarin symbols, it reads: 'We are inmates of the Hubei Xiangna Prison, working on clothing lines for export over a long period of time. 'We work 15 hours a day. We eat meals that are lower than low, what we eat is worse than pig or dog food. We work our fingers to the bone. 'We urge the international communities to condemn the Chinese Government for this behavior of abusing human rights.' Karen, from County Fermanagh, Ireland, did not dicover the note until three years later as the trousers lay unworn at the back of her wardrobe. She said: 'I was shocked to find the card inside the trousers. I felt sick. 'If I had found that note back then I might have been able to do something to help. 'But the man in the picture looks quite old and I’m worried it might be too late to help him now.' Primark denied prisoners or forced labour are used in the production of its clothes and have opened an investigation. A shopper was stunned when she discovered this SOS letter from a Chinese sweatshop worker - in the pocket of her Primark jeans. Miss Gallagher said: 'I’ve got no idea who put it there but it really took the wind out of my sails. 'It makes me think that it was a cry for help - to let us people in Britain know what is going on. 'I even rung Primark to ask them about it. But I was put on hold for 15 minutes before being cut off. 'I would dread to think that this might involve child labour and people’s terrible working conditions. 'You hear all sorts of stories about people working in sweatshops abroad - it made me feel so guilty that I can never wear that dress again.” A Primark spokesperson described the label finds as “strange” and have asked the customers to give them the dresses for their investigation. He said: “We are investigating the origins of an additional label which has been found in one of our dresses and whether there are issues which need to be looked into.” Primark’s ethics came under fire in 2011 after the collapse of a garment factory in Bangladesh killed 1,000 workers, 580 of whom were employed by a Primark supplier. The company recently announced it will pay out compensation to workers who were injured and the families of workers who died in the collapse. The high street chain assured that it has 'a code of conduct in place, to ensure products are made in good working conditions and all employees are treated fairly.'","Two women find labels in Primark dresses referring to poor working conditions .

"Authorities are bracing for nudity, drugs and general free-spiritedness during a counterculture gathering that began near Salt Lake City this week, compelling a pair of nearby Mormon church-owned girls' summer camps to move elsewhere. The first attendees are setting up camp at the annual Rainbow Family gathering, where attendance is expected to total about 10,000. They have begun building kitchens and setting up tents in advance of their July 4 celebration. Most visitors have come without incident through the closest town of Heber City, said Wasatch County Sheriff's Deputy Jared Rigby. A total of around 10,000 people are expected to attend this years Rainbow Family festival in northern Utah, with attendees already starting to arrive for the July 4 celebrations. Here participants attend festival at Oscala National Forest in Florida in 2012 . The Rainbow Family are committed to peace and egalitarianism and have thrown annual events every year - almost always in out-of-the-way parks and forests - since the 1970s . The Rainbow Family has no formal structure or leaders. An informal council decides each year where the gathering will be held. For years, the decisions have sparked court battles with the Forest Service over the group's right to gather without a permit . But even just a few menaces have rankled locals in the town of 12,000, which is dotted with churches and bordered by vast fields and ranches. Some revelers have already crashed a nearby wedding reception in search of food. Police also expect to find marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine in coming weeks, but aren't saying whether the drugs have already turned up. They have doubled their force with help from the state. 'We don't deal with a lot of panhandling, people asking for handouts,' Rigby said. 'We don't have a lot of lewdness or public urination.' With only about 200 participants, the gathering Sunday logged one death when a 39-year-old New Hampshire woman was found on the site hunkered around a bend in the Duchesne River, Rigby said. She apparently died in her sleep, he added. For the most part, participants have cooperated with officials, asking how they can limit their toll on the land at the spot about 40 miles east of Salt Lake City, said Dave Whittekiend of the Forest Service. Flashback: The Rainbow Family gathering of 2006, which took place in Colorado. The festival is known for choosing a different state for each year, with members traveling from all over . Last year the Rainbow Family gathered in Montana¿s Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest . Video taken by attendees of the 2013 Rainbow Family Gathering show people arriving at but Montana¿s Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest . 'People have approached and asked, ''How can we be lighter on the ground; how can we minimize those impacts?'"" he said. They have 'been very open' to requests of biologists, who barred the group from setting up camp within 200 feet of the river, Whittekiend said. It's the first year the annual event has come to Utah since 2003, when it set up on the northern side of the same mountain range. It has convened every year since 1972. Last year, the group chose Montana's Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, where law enforcement costs related to the gathering totaled $575,000, according to the Forest Service. Officers issued hundreds of citations but only arrested two people out of 10,000. Officials there compiled a list of lessons learned, advising their counterparts in other states to make clear where participants may camp, set up fires and retrieve water.

Its creed revolves around nonviolence, inclusiveness and praying for peace, according to a number of websites asserting ties to the group. The gatherings take the name 'rainbow' because they aim to incorporate a spectrum of people and cultures, says one website. Jan Olpin, co-owner of the Dairy Keen, spotted a group in recent days rummaging through the eatery's garbage, 'so I said, ''Here's your cheeseburger with some soup, fries and a drink''.' That's a one-off, she said: Police are urging against such donations. At a community meeting, officials said the festival would boost local business, quelling anxiety, Olpin said. Some pledged to welcome the visitors but also vowed to lock their cars. 'The whole audience kind of agreed we need to do what's best for Heber and make these people feel welcome,' Olpin said, 'yet be vigilant'.","The Rainbow Family of Living Light are committed to peace and egalitarianism .

"Sex traffickers are using Facebook to 'enslave' women, forcing them into prostitution and other criminal activity, the head of the European policing agency has warned. Rob Wainwright, the director of Europol, said that advertisements on social media sites promising work in childcare or cleaning were used by criminal gangs to draw in vulnerable young women. He claimed the traffickers then used internet technology such as webcams to monitor their victims, controlling their movements and ensuring they turned up to work in brothels or other criminal enterprises. Rob Wainwright (pictured), the director of Europol, said that advertisements on social media sites were used by criminal gangs to draw in vulnerable young women and called for the 'culture of policing' to change . Speaking to the Centre for Social Justice think tank in London, Mr Wainwright said the use of modern technology had enabled the 'industrialisation' of the traffickers' activities, allowing them to control many more problems. 'Facebook is effectively being used in many cases as the means to attract and then enslave vulnerable young women,' he said. 'They (the traffickers) are using the modern technological tools to more efficiently monitor an increasing number of victims. 'So instead of paying them a visit every day they can use the webchat services but also webcam cameras to confirm that they are where they should be, they are in that brothel waiting for the next customer. 'In the past, the pimps and traffickers had to do that by physically visiting them. Now they can just do it at the click of a button and therefore control 50 victims much more easily and readily in virtual form. 'What that allows therefore is a sort of industrialisation of the problem. Single traffickers and pimps can control many more victims.' Mr Wainwright said that people trafficking was regarded as a 'low-risk, high profit' activity by criminal gangs generating an estimated £100billion-a-year for organised crime. Mr Wainwright claimed the traffickers use internet technology such as webcams to monitor their victims, controlling their movements and ensuring they turned up to work in brothels (file picture, posed by model) Up to 36 million people worldwide are thought to be held in modern slavery - at least 500,000 in Europe. Most of the victims in Europe are from Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary with the UK, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands the main destinations for trafficking. Mr Wainwright said there needed to be much greater co-operation among international law enforcement agencies to deal with the problem. He said: 'As things currently stand, organised crime groups are going about the business of modern slavery and with little fear of being caught and pursued. We urgently need to do much better. 'The international law enforcement community needs to trust each other a bit more. 'There is no point in sitting on a vital piece of information in one country if it can break a syndicate spread across five or more others. 'The culture of policing must change.'","Europol director said social media sites are being used by sex traffickers .

"Hannah Barnes asked hospital staff to call her an ambulance when she was suffering a heart attack - but they told her to call her own . A grandmother who had a heart attack outside a hospital walk-in centre was forced to call her own ambulance - because staff were not allowed to, it has been claimed. Hannah Barnes, 58, from Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, went to the town's Palmer Community Hospital to get help after she began to feel unwell and matched the symptoms to a previous heart attack. But despite begging receptionists to call someone she was refused help and instead told to ring the emergency services herself. The grandmother-of-three was then forced to frantically search her bag for her mobile phone before calling ambulance crews for help. She was admitted to hospital where she has stayed for the past week in a critical condition after suffering her second heart attack in just six months. Yesterday Ms Barnes' furious family hit out at the medical centre, claiming she could have died if she had not had her phone with her. Tina Barnes, her sister, said: 'The whole family is devastated. I could have lost my sister. Would making a free phone call really have harmed them? 'A medical centre is meant to be the place you can turn to. But she had to get help on her own. She is full of life and would do anything for anyone. She didn't deserve this. 'She also suffered a serious heart attack in January. She was outside the walk-in centre and went to get help. She asked a receptionist if they could ring an ambulance as she was having a heart attack. 'But she said she couldn't do that and she would have to ring herself. She doesn't always have her mobile phone with her. If she hadn't had it, she would have died.' Hannah had been visiting her sister for coffee at around 8.30am when she began to feel hot. She decided to head to the bank before going home when all of a sudden she felt a problem 'building up and up'. Ms Barnes immediately recognised the symptoms as the same as those she experienced in January and rushed to Jarrow's Palmer Community Hospital for help. Tina Barnes, her sister, said: 'The whole family is devastated. I could have lost my sister. Would making a free phone call really have harmed them?' The walk-in centre is run by Northern Doctors Urgent Care Ltd and based at Palmer Community Hospital . When ambulance crews finally arrived she was taken to the Freeman Hospital, in Newcastle, where she remains. Tina added: 'She says she will never forget the face of the woman who said she couldn't call her an ambulance. I want those responsible to be named and shamed. 'Her grandchildren are all devastated as well.' A spokesman for Northern Doctors Urgent Care Ltd, which runs the walk-in centre, said: 'Our organisational procedures dictate that when any patient presents to the reception, the receptionist will undertake a brief visual assessment of the patient's presenting condition. 'They will refer to our organisational urgency criteria which clearly identifies the symptoms associated with patients presenting with emergency, urgent or non-urgent conditions, and the actions to be taken accordingly. 'Therefore, when a patient presents to a receptionist requesting an ambulance, the receptionist will briefly identify the physical presenting condition of the patient and seek immediate clinical advice from one of our GPs; while, if necessary, calling 999.' Christine Briggs, director of operations at NHS South Tyneside Clinical Commissioning Group, said: 'We commission urgent care services in South Tyneside. 'While we cannot comment on individual cases, all our providers are expected to deliver good services and where appropriate, services should signpost and direct patients onwards to other relevant services, and seek appropriate assistance where necessary.'","Hannah Barnes realised she was in danger and went to community hospital .

"A self-styled 'Al Qaeda gunman' was shot and wounded in the French city of Toulouse today after holding four hostages during a six-hour siege of a bank. Armed tactical police stormed the branch of Credit Industrial and Commercial (CIC) shortly before 5pm, releasing the manager and another senior member of staff. Two others had been released earlier in the day by the 26-year-old, named only as 'Bouzema', who had fired a shot during a would-be robbery. Preparation: Crack elite police officers arrive at the Toulouse bank which has been taken over by an 'Al Qaeda' gunman . High alert: Colleges and schools have been evacuated as the siege continues . Under siege: Police officers securing a street near the bank . The drama took place just 100 yards from where Islamic terrorist Mohammed Merah, 23, died in a hail of bullets after holing-up in his flat for 32 hours after he had himself killed seven people in March. Referring to today's drama, local police union spokesman Cedric Delage said: 'It's an attempt at an armed theft which has turned into a hostage situation.' The gunman is said to have taken hostages when a bank employee refused to give him cash, said Mr Delage. But, despite his claim to be a terrorist, the gunman was a known schizophrenic with a 'strong religious conviction', according to a spokesman for the Toulouse Prosecutor. The man had asked for officers of the elite RAID tactical unit who killed Merah to attend the scene, but instead their brother police unit, the GIPN, went in. Shots were heard, along with small explosions as doors were blown off their hinge, and within minutes the man had been captured. On patrol: Residents look on as elite police officers set off to assess the situation . Spectators: A woman looks on as police get ready in Toulouse, while the world's media also watches . Locked down: A woman gestures at the window at the first floor of a building, above a bank where the gunman has stormed . He was wounded in the stomach, but was in a 'stable' condition and likely to make a full recovery, said a local police spokesman. Staff at the Caousou college confirmed that all of there 2,000 odd students - from kindergarten age to 18 - had been sent home during the siege. Among those evacuated were four- and five-year-olds from a private language school next to the bank. Valerie Ruckly-Gravier, who heads the . Happy Momes school, or Happy Kids, said police advised that the . security parameters in place could last throughout the day. 'I had to call the parents ... The . police accompanied the group to the parents at the end of the street,' Ruckly-Gravier said by telephone. The gunman's sister, who spoke under condition of anonymity, said he was an 'angry' character who had 'fear of the outside world.' There had originally been fears that the 'Al Qaeda operative' wanted to gain his revenge for what happened to Merah, possibly by initiating a shoot-out with the RAID. Merah's father, Benalel Merah, had accused the unit of 'executing' his son and is currently trying to sue the French government over what happened. Mr Merah senior, who lives in Algeria, has filed a lawsuit in Paris against those 'at the top of the police force who gave the orders' to kill his son. Preparing: Police officers don protective clothing as they stand in the Toulouse street . Siege: Four people are being held hostage by a self-styled Al Qaeda gunman in the French city of Toulouse . Scene: This bank in Toulouse is where a self-styled member of Al Qaeda has taken hostages . Merah, who was born and brought up in Toulouse, confessed to killing seven people, including Jewish children and three soldiers, in a rampage caused outrage across the world. It later emerged that Merah had attended terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, and that he had links with Al Qaeda groups. There have been fears since the atrocities that Merah was working with other Islamic radicals in France and that they might strike at any time. Merah's older brother, Abdelkader Merah, is currently being held in a high-security prison on suspicion of assisting his brother in the seven murders. Elite RAID officers assaulted the French national weather centre in Toulouse earlier this month when another gunman took hostages. He was seriously wounded but nobody else was hurt.

Boggs said a blonde woman who was riding with the man in cropped jeans then ran up to the two brawlers and jumped on top of the victim, pinning him to the blacktop. The video shows the aggressor punching the immobilized man in the face with the woman seated on his chest. The footage shows the enraged driver leaning close to the face of the restrained man lying prostrate on his back and pointing at him. According to Boggs, the man who was attacked by the couple did not show any hostility towards them even as his assailant continued pummeling him. Boggs eventually left the scene after dialling 911 because he said he feared for his own safety. None of the people involved in the incident have been identified, and as of Tuesday afternoon no arrests have been made. Livid: The footage shows the enraged driver leaning close to the face of the restrained man lying prostrate on his back and pointing at him . The Kentucky State Police are reviewing Boggs' video and will consult with the county attorney to determine if any charges should be filed.

"Harrowing: Campaigner Shaista Gohir said an Asian girl had been raped by 30 men during a six-hour attack. (Stock picture) A teenage girl was groomed and raped by up to 30 Asian men - including a father and his schoolboy son - during an horrific sex attack lasting six hours, an inquiry heard. Campaigner Shaista Gohir MBE detailed abuse of the young vulnerable Asian girl in a shocking report highlighting how rife grooming was within ethnic communities. She claimed that sexual exploitation and grooming of young Asian girls by men of the same ethnic origins was happening under the noses of authorities - with community leaders, schools and families are all too ready to dismiss the attacks or even cover them up. Muslim and women's rights activist Ms Gohir used the harrowing Birmingham case, involving a teenage girl who was allegedly raped by between 20 to 30 men, to call on authorities to do more to tackle the issue. The attack was said to have taken place over six hours and included a father and son, who was in school uniform, and taxi drivers who turned up in groups. The report, presented to Birmingham City Council, followed interviews with 35 victims, as well as several sex attackers from Muslim communities throughout the UK. Ms Gohir also challenged the popular view that grooming and exploitation, as in high-profile cases in Rochdale and Oxford, was mainly carried out by gangs of Asian men abusing white girls. 'People tell me they have heard about Rochdale and Oxford and see it as something which happens elsewhere to other people, but it is happening in Birmingham, it's happening everywhere,' she said. This warning came in the same week as a child sex gang was jailed for abusing young girls. Judge John Bevan QC said the four Roma men and boys and an Iraqi Kurd had ignored the responsibilities of living in this country as he sentenced them for raping and sexually assaulting five girls aged as young as 12. Abusers: Hassan Abdulla, left, and Jan Kandrac were part of a gang jailed for a total of 54 years at the Old Bailey in London for raping and sexually abusing girls as young as 12 in Peterborough . Widespread: Gang members Renato Balog and Zdeno Mirga were jailed in the same week as a campaigner highlighted the shocking scale of abuse of children in ethnic communities across Britain . Four of the gang members were from the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Two of the victims were Czech and Slovak, while the other three are English. Last year, seven Oxford men, mostly of Pakistani heritage, were convicted at the Old Bailey of running a paedophile sex ring. That trial had followed another, almost exactly 12 months earlier, concerning nine Asian men based in Rochdale. Ms Gohir said girls are more likely to be targeted by people of the same ethnic and cultural background. MPs said public officials must stop 'tip-toeing' around race when tackling child sex gangs and claimed that there is a trend of Asian gangs targeting youngsters. A dangerous trend of Pakistani men grooming young white girls does exist, according to a Commons home affairs committee report in June 2013. Police, prosecutors and social workers must be able to raise the issue without fear of being accused of racism, the committee said. But it warned against stereotyping offenders because there is no straightforward link between race and child sexual exploitation. In shocking conclusions to a year-long inquiry, MPs said there were still areas where victims were being failed by the authorities. Rochdale and Rotherham councils were accused of being 'inexcusably slow' to realise sex abuse was taking place on their doorstep. And they said both councils had a 'woeful lack of professional curiosity' and were responsible for the 'appalling consequences of their indifference to the suffering of vulnerable children'. They may also be particularly vulnerable to abuse as they can be blackmailed into keeping quiet because of the risk of 'bringing shame' on a community, she added. When abuse is revealed some families are more likely to send the daughter abroad or hastily arrange a wedding to get rid of the problem rather than face it, the report claims. 'The biggest barrier that we need to address is the shame and honour card,' Ms Gohir said. 'They would rather protect the honour of the family and community than report an offender and protect other girls, as well as get the victim the counselling and help they need.' She also added attitudes of young boys and men needed to change as often they did not see what they did as rape, and had no awareness of the impact of their actions on women. Members of the council enquiry are considering new measures including raising the issue with parents or teenagers through secondary schools and encouraging greater use of relationship education. Labour councillor Waseem Zaffer said: 'I have seen this presentation three times and each time I get angrier and angrier. There are a number of issues in the south Asian community which are swept under the carpet and this is one of them.' Inquiry chairwoman Cllr Anita Ward added: 'When we are dealing with child sexual exploitation we need to recognise that it is not only Asian men grooming white girls. The victims do not come from any one particular culture or community, and neither do the perpetrators. The inquiry will take further evidence in March before compiling a report for the city council.","Campaigner Shaista Gohir detailed abuse by Asian men on Asian girls .

"Britain's baby boomers are choosing to face the final curtain with a laugh with Monty Python’s irreverent hit Always Look on the Bright Side of Life topping the charts as the most popular funeral song. The tongue-in-cheek ditty poking fun at death has replaced Frank Sinatra's My Way  as the most popular song played at funerals - the first time the song has been toppled from the number one spot since 2002. The song, written by Eric Idle, was taken from the controversial 1979 film The Life of Brian - which was banned in Norway and Ireland. Scroll down for video . Britain's baby boomers are choosing to face the final curtain with a laugh, as Monty Python’s irreverent hit Always Look on the Bright Side of Life tops the charts as the best funeral song . The song, written by Eric Idle, was taken from the controversial 1979 film The Life of Brian - which was banned in Norway and Ireland . A study by The Co-operative Funeralcare showed that traditional hymns, football anthems and classic pop songs top the list of the 'funeral music chart'. A study of songs played at 30,000 funerals also showed some unusual requests such as Abba, Elvis Presley, Star Wars or Blues Brothers fancy dress themed services. The top 10 included Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life, The Lord Is My Shepherd, Abide With Me, Match Of The Day theme, My Way, All Things Bright And Beautiful and Angels by Robbie Williams. Queen is the most popular group for funeral songs such as Who Wants To Live Forever, while an increasing number of songs written by the deceased are played. The tongue-in-cheek song poking fun at death has replaced Frank Sinatra's My Way as the most popular song played at funerals - the first time the song has been toppled from the number one spot since 2002 . David Collingwood, operations director of The Co-operative Funeralcare, said: 'We think we may be seeing a generational shift in attitudes towards funerals, and the choice of music being requested. 'Music plays such an important part in people's lives that it now acts as the theme tune to their passing. 'Modern funerals are very much about personal choice, which can be reflected in the choice of music, dress, coffin, flowers, hearses or memorials.'","Replaced Frank Sinatra's My Way as most popular song played at funerals .

"The former black student body president at a pricey New Jersey prep school was forced to resign from her leadership position earlier this year after she posted a series of photos on the Internet, in which she is seen dressed as what she describes to be the typical male, white student at the school. In the photos, former Lawrenceville School Student Body President Maya Peterson is seen wearing L.L. Bean duck boots, a Yale University sweatshirt and is holding a hockey stick, which she says is representative of the typical 'Lawrenceville boi.' In addition to the photos, she added hashtags like '#romney2016,' '#confederate,' and '#peakedinhighschool.' 'Racist': Maya Peterson's classmates at the Lawrenceville School found this photo and the accompanying hashtags to be offensive . In a lengthy article on the Buzzfeed website, Peterson explains that the photos were meant as a joke in response to complaints made by students about her senior photos, in which she and 10 friends - all of whom were black - are seen raising their fists in a 'Black Power' salute. 'I understand why I hurt people’s feelings, but I didn’t become . president to make sure rich white guys had more representation on . campus,' she told the website. 'Let’s be honest. They’re not the ones that feel . uncomfortable here.' Some of Peterson's classmates, however, didn't see the humor in her 'racist' photos. 'You’re the student body president, and you’re mocking and blatantly . insulting a large group of the school’s male population,' one student . commented on the photo. Peterson's response to the comment only made things worse. Prep: Lawrenceville School in New Jersey is the most expensive high school in America . Controversial: Peterson's election as student body president was controversial . 'Yes, I am making a mockery of the right-wing, confederate-flag hanging, . openly misogynistic Lawrentians,' Peterson responded. 'If that’s a . large portion of the school’s male population, then I think the issue is . not with my bringing attention to it in a lighthearted way, but rather . why no one has brought attention to it before…' In March, about three weeks after posting the photos on social media websites, administrators at the $53,000 per year school - the most expensive high school in the country - told her that she would face disciplinary action if she did not resign from her position as student body president. Both students and faculty members felt the images were offensive, and that 'it was not fitting of a student leader to make comments mocking members . of the community,' Dean of Students Nancy Thomas told the Lawrenceville . student paper. Peterson's take on race has irritated her classmates in the past, as well. Weed: In addition to the racial overtones to much of her social media accounts, photos emerged of Peterson smoking marijuana . In 2012, following the re-election of President Barack Obama, Peterson wrote on Facebook about how proud she was that an African-American was president - and threw in a sarcastic jab at white people. 'As a black and Latino, gay woman in the United States of America, today . is a momentous day,' she wrote. 'I’m sorry to all the rich white men . who have failed to elect a president that endorses their greed.' Some of her classmates felt the Facebook post was racist. 'I’m . gonna have to assume from your political beliefs and what you’ve said . that you do not pay for your Lawrenceville tuition in its entirety,' one . student wrote. 'But do . you know who pays for that? Yeah, that would be all those greedy white . men who actually worked for their fortune, not relied on the government . to support them. Just saying.' Peterson's family paid full tuition at the school. Inclusion: Students felt Peterson's actions did not promote inclusion at the school and only further divided the students . Peterson's getting elected student body president worried many of her classmates, as they believed she was alienating a large portion of the student body with her controversial comments about white classmates. Shortly after her election, an anonymous student sent photos of Peterson smoking marijuana to school officials. The school received several other complaints about Peterson, including charges that she posted racist comments on Twitter about a fellow student who was a Sikh. One former student said Peterson's photos - and overall attitude, 'violated the spirit of the Lawrenceville community.' 'It was hateful. It wasn’t inclusive,' the student, identified only as David, said. 'When I think of Maya Peterson, I . don’t think of someone who is an avid proponent of progress or of . inclusiveness. I think of someone who is hateful. She had a hateful . spirit.'","Maya Peterson was Lawrenceville School's first black, female student body president .

"Warrant Officer Will Casson-Smith (pictured) denies an accusation of sexual assault. The bandmaster is currently facing a court martial . A drunk Army bandmaster lured a teenage trainee musician to his room and attacked her, a court martial heard. Warrant Officer Will Casson-Smith, 35, a leading figure in one of Britain’s most prestigious military bands, stripped to his underpants and admired himself in the mirror before sexually assaulting the girl, it was claimed. She was then 19 and believed they were going to his room to talk about her Army career. Lieutenant Colonel Graham Coombes, prosecuting, told a panel of five officers: ‘Fortified by alcohol, he lured her to his room to try his luck with her in a sexual manner. ‘The defendant took advantage of his rank to take advantage of his victim. ‘She was a trainee 15 years his junior. He lured her back to his accommodation in the Warrant Officers’ and Sergeants’ Mess where he sexually assaulted her.’ The court heard Casson-Smith, of the Royal Artillery Band, undressed himself and kissed her on the lips and neck, before putting his hand under her sweater and feeling her breasts. Colonel Coombes told the court martial in Colchester, Essex, yesterday: ‘He upped the sexual ante. ‘She was trapped by the disparity in rank between them – she a phase two trainee and he a WO1 [Warrant Officer Class 1]. She also knew she was not supposed to be there in the accommodation.’ He added: ‘Casson-Smith says he has no memory of the incident due to the amount of alcohol he had consumed that day.’ The alleged victim visited a pub across the road from Kneller Hall, the Royal Military School of Music, near Twickenham, south-west London, in October last year. Casson-Smith, who was then master of the band of the Adjutant General’s Corps, was drunk in the pub and was seen wobbling on his feet, singing and rapping. The woman, who is now 20 and cannot be named for legal reasons, was having doubts about continuing her career as an Army musician. The pair chatted in the pub’s smoking area and she returned to the base with him. She told the court: ‘I was thinking of transferring because I was not enjoying music as much as I thought I would. I thought we were going to the room to continue the conversation about my career. ‘I was nervous because I should not have been there. The woman told Royal Military Police in an interview played to the court: ‘He took off his shoes and then his socks. He then took off his shirt and began admiring himself in the mirror … I just wanted to get out. I had a rush-of-blood feeling, fear. I was scared. ‘Then he began kissing me on the lips and the neck. He was trying to get his tongue into my mouth. I was backing off because I did not want him to kiss me. I did not kiss him back. Pictured is Kneller Hall in Twickenham, where the Royal Military School of Music is based . ‘He was pulling my jumper up to get it off and I … kept it down. He put his hand inside my jumper and T-shirt. He was running his fingers across my stomach. ‘I felt I couldn’t say anything to him. He got his hand further up and touched my breasts inside my bra … I pushed his arm out.’ She said she then managed to leave the room. Casson-Smith told Royal Military Police that he found the allegation ‘extremely upsetting’. He added: ‘I got very drunk and cannot recall the detail of what occurred. I do not remember when I left the pub or what may or may not have happened after that … I cannot believe I would do anything like this.’ Casson-Smith denies sexual assault. The court martial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Will Casson-Smith lured girl to room to 'try his luck' with her, court heard .

"Lying on the ground in agony after a motorbike accident, former RAF corporal Craig Stevens was understandably relieved when a Good Samaritan stopped by his side. But to his horror, instead of attending to the blood pouring from his leg, the man began to search through his pockets. Vulnerable, terrified and in excruciating pain, Mr Stevens pleaded with the stranger to stop – but to no avail. Craig Stevens, pictured with his partner Nita Maisuria in his hospital room in St Mary's, Paddington after being knocked off his motorbike and then robbed . ‘I cannot believe that someone could do that to me, when I was so helpless and in need,’ the 51-year-old said from his hospital bed. ‘I could feel his hands going through all of my pockets, I couldn’t move. I was trapped, in pain and heavily bleeding. I was pleading with him to stop, to help me instead of stealing from me but he carried on. I feel angry. I feel violated.’ Mr Stevens, who served in the Gulf War, was injured as he went to fill his motorbike with petrol ready for a charity ride with the Royal British Legion. Mr Steven's partner, Nita Maisuria, says she is appalled that when her partner needed help, someone acted in such a 'disgusting' way . His arm was broken and his leg cut down to the bone – a critical injury due to the blood-thinning medication he takes for leukaemia, which he was diagnosed with three years ago. Following the accident in Hayes, West London, last week, the former RAF corporal has undergone two major operations and a skin graft on his leg, and remains in St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington. However Mr Stevens, from Bexhill-on-Sea in East Sussex, said he also feels betrayed by the police, who he says told him they would not investigate the theft. ‘The man who did this is still out there,’ he said. ‘The police said they would only investigate the accident and not the robbery – that is not their choice to make. I am a victim of crime, he might have only taken the £40 I had in cash, but that is not the point. I want the police to do something.’ After his ordeal, an off-duty nurse came to his aid and dialled 999. Mr Stevens, left, served with the RAF for nine years and is pictured in a glider in 1989. Now he is in hospital recovering from two major operations and a skin graft on his leg . His girlfriend Nita Maisuria, 35, has stayed by his side in hospital. She said: ‘This is the last thing you expect to happen in England. ‘I am appalled that people like this exist and that when Craig needed help, someone acted in such a disgusting way.’ Mr Stevens – who has a 17-year-old daughter from a previous marriage – served with the RAF for nine years before joining Air Canada as an engineer. Since his cancer diagnosis he has become an active member of the Royal British Legion and now helps to organise fundraising motorcycle rides, which he joins on his beloved Triumph Bonneville. The accident happened on Uxbridge Road in Hayes at 2:30pm on Saturday, June 7. Mr Stevens describes his attacker as black, around 5ft 6in tall, in his 40s and wearing a trilby hat. After being contacted by the Daily Mail, police officers visited Mr Stevens in hospital to take a statement regarding the robbery.","Craig Stevens injured his leg after a motorbike accident in west London .

"Clive Palmer has spent $26 million of his own money keeping his political party afloat in the last financial year. The Palmer United Party's donation records have revealed that $26 million of the $28.76 million it received, came directly from the politician and mining magnate's multiple private businesses. Aside from a personal donation of over $100,000 from Mr Palmer himself, the rest of the money was donated via his mining company Mineralogy ($8.2 million), his nickel and cobalt refinery Queensland Nickel ($15.2 million), Palmer Leisure Australia ($90,283) and the Palmer Coolum Resort ($2.3 million). The Palmer United Party's donation records have revealed Clive Palmer donated $26 million of his own money to the group in the last financial year . Aside from a personal donation of over $100,000 from Mr Palmer himself, the rest of the money was donated via his mining company Mineralogy, his nickel and cobalt refinery Queensland Nickel, Palmer Leisure Australia and the Palmer Coolum Resort (pictured) The sum dwarfed the total amount of donations recorded by both the Labour and Liberal parties, which declared $8.4 million and $18.6 million respectively. However, the Electoral Commission Queensland is still awaiting legal documentation in the form of an 'auditor's certificate' from the PUP, and a declaration of a further $6 million in donations that is currently part of a larger sum of money forming the subject of a civil trial and under investigation by police, The Australian reports. Revelations of Mr Palmer's enormous expenditure have come only days after Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie departed from the group, leading the party's head to make an array of accusations. Mr Palmer told ABC Radio that the established parties would always try and wreck new political movements like his, saying 'They try to infiltrate it and to blow it up'. The revelation come a few days after Senator Jacqui Lambie quit the PUP, announcing that Tasmanians, not Clive Palmer, 'are my boss' 'She's been sent in there by someone to cause trouble, I think that's the reality of it.' His party had a team investigating her, he said. The PUP leader issued a statement accusing Senator Lambie of establishing the Australian Defence Veterans Party between winning the election and taking up her seat in the Senate for PUP. Senator Lambie formally resigned from his party on Monday and declared that she will not form nor join another party, claiming it was a case of 'once bitten, twice shy'. The Tasmanian Senator, 43, won a place in parliament at the 2013 federal election (September 7) and the 'deal-breaker' for her decision to go it alone was the overwhelming support from her home state and not her disintegrating relationship with Mr Palmer. Senator Jacqui Lambie speaks in the Senate chamber in Parliament House in Canberra. Ms Lambie announced she would resign from the Palmer United Party and continue to serve as an Independent Senator . 'I started thinking about where we were going about a month or 6 weeks ago, it's all come to a head, I didn't believe it was in the best interests of Tasmania and was better on my own two feet,' Ms Lambie said. The pair has not spoken since Remembrance Day. Her former party leader launched a broadside in an interview with Fairfax Media, telling them she pre-empted an imminent move by the party against her, by leaving. 'I think you can understand that it's a good outcome for the party because her views are in conflict with what the people who elected her care about,' he said. 'I don't think she'll achieve very much as a senator generally.' Jacqui Lambie took her place as deputy leader of the Senate for the Palmer United Party on July 1 this year but she was stripped of that deputy role in the Senate for PUP last week, following heated words with Mr Palmer. If she runs into her former boss in parliament she said 'I'll just smile at him and say hello because that is the polite thing to do'. Senator Lambie has called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to admit he was wrong on ADF member payments and Australians 'will forgive him' 'My resignation today will end that damaging speculation and uncertainty,' she told parliament. 'I must be free to vote in the Senate in the best interest of Tasmanians.' Senator Lambie said she had been thinking over her party membership while she got legal advice on leaving PUP. At a media conference she reinforced a determination to negotiate a better pay deal for Australian Defence Force members. 'The Prime Minister has done the wrong thing in this area, it takes a big man to admit he's wrong,' she said. 'If Mr Abbott rethinks the pay offer for ADF members then I'm sure Australians will forgive him. It's about our national security, about the morale of people who are putting their lives on the line.' Clive Palmer and Jacqui Lambie have not spoken since a row about Remembrance Day. He's told Fairfax Media that her departure pre-empted a party move against her and insists she will not achieve very much as senator .","The majority of the money came from the politician and mining magnate's multiple private businesses, including Mineralogy and Palmer Coolum Resort .

"One of the teenagers accused of the murder of Australian baseballer Chris Lane will no longer face a first-degree murder charge and is testifying against two co-defendants. The Stephens County District Attorney's Office on Tuesday filed a motion to dismiss the murder charge against James Francis Edwards Jr. Edwards Jr will instead be charged with the lesser offence of accessory after the fact in the shooting death of 22-year-old Lane. Scroll down for video . Australian baseballer, 22, was shot dead while jogging in Oklahoma in August, by three 'bored' teenagers . Edwards testified against 18-year-old Michael Dewayne Jones and 17-year-old Chancey Luna during their preliminary hearings and is expected to testify against them at trial in August. Both are charged with first-degree murder. Prosecutors had earlier said they would dismiss the first-degree murder charge against Edwards in exchange for his continued testimony. Evidence gathered since the killing 'tends to further implicate Chancey Luna and Michael Jones and further casts doubt on the role of Edwards in the murder of Christopher Lane,' according to the motion. James Francis Edward Jr's charge has been downgraded to accessory after the fact and he will give evidence against his two alleged accomplices . The motion stated that 'it is in the best interests of justice that this matter be dismissed and that the State be allowed to proceed against Edwards in the juvenile division of the Stephens County District Court.' Lane was shot while jogging along a tree-lined road in Duncan, Oklahoma while visiting his girlfriend's parents in August. Investigators said he was randomly targeted by 'bored' teenagers. He had been preparing to enter his senior baseball season at East Central University in Ada. Edwards' mother, Brenda Edwards, said following the closed-door court hearing on Tuesday that her heart goes out to all the families involved. 'I never got a chance to acknowledge the Christopher Lane family and I just wanted to make that acknowledgement,' said Brenda Edwards, who had been in prison for drug charges and was released in April, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections website. However, the mother of Chancey Luna, another of the accused, is outraged at the deal prosecutors struck with the youngest of the trio. 'I'm really upset about it,' said Luna's mother, Jennifer, who said her son says he is innocent. 'It's awful. 'I'm sick to my stomach.' Ms Luna said Edwards Jr lived at her home before the shooting, but now he has turned his back on her and Chancey. 'James was calling me from jail and said, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I still love you Mum', because I was like a mum to him,' Ms Luna said. Chancey Allen Luna, 17, (left) and Michael Jones, 18, (right) both still face murder charges as Edwards turned on them to give evidence for the prosecution . A few days after Lane's murder Stephens County District Attorney Jason Hicks argued Edwards Jr should not be granted bail because he believed Edwards Jr 'was a threat to the community'. The prosecutor told how Edwards Jr danced when he was first brought to the Stephens County Jail and was treating the arrest as a 'joke'. It was a different story in the Duncan courtroom on Tuesday. 'Our case is not strong enough to take him to trial,' Hicks told Judge Jerry Herberger, the Duncan Banner newspaper reported. Edwards Jr, a junior wrestling champion nicknamed 'Bug', testified for the prosecution at a preliminary hearing for Luna and Jones in February, but instead of bolstering the prosecution's case, Luna's lawyers said it showed Lane's death was not premeditated murder, but manslaughter or second degree murder. Edwards Jr told the court Jones' Ford Focus swerved just before Luna fired the gun from the back seat out a window and Luna said he thought blanks were in the gun, not bullets. Because the charge is in juvenile court, records in the case are sealed. There is also a gag order.

"Notorious gangster: Frankie Fraser died today at 90 . Notorious gangster 'Mad' Frankie Fraser died in hospital today aged 90, relatives have revealed. The criminal, who has spent almost half his life in prison, passed away earlier at King's College Hospital in Denmark Hill, south-east London, after falling critically ill. His family decided to withdraw life support for Fraser - infamous for pulling out rivals' teeth with a pair of pliers - this morning after he was induced into a coma in the intensive care unit following complications during the operation. His son Dave, 66, told the Daily Mirror: ‘We’re just glad he’s not in pain and isn’t suffering any more. He had a good innings and fought until the end but it was just too much for him.’ The news of his death was also confirmed by his ex-associate Eddie Richardson, who said: 'He's had a long life and I don't think he's done too bad. He had Alzheimer's for about three years, so I don't think he knew what day it was.' It is believed Fraser had gone into hospital for a hip operation but doctors spotted he had a fractured left leg two weeks later. Fraser had been one of the last surviving ‘celebrity criminals’ after he joined turf wars between London gangs in the sixties. He was a member of the Richardson gang or the 'torture gang', led by brothers Charlie and Eddie Richardson, and were widely feared in London’s underworld. Prior to that he was a bodyguard to notorious gangland leader Billy Hill, where he took part in bank robberies and carried out razor blade attacks - which earned him £50 a time. He has spent 42 years - almost half his life - in jail for 26 offences. The former gangland leader was handed an Asbo last year after flying into a rage with a fellow pensioner at his care home. Scroll down for video . Horrifying: Fraser  at Brick Lane Music Hall in east London in 1995. He was notorious for his torture methods which involved pulling out enemies teeth with pliers . Notorious gang leader Fraser, pictured (wearing glasses, centre) with Reggie Kray (right) at the funeral of his twin brother Ronnie Kray in East London in 1995, despite being in a rival gang during 1960s turf wars . Staff called police after things got heated between Fraser and the 87-year-old man, who has dementia, after he found him sitting in his favourite seat. He was admitted to sheltered accommodation in Bermondsey, south-east London, just a few miles from haunts during his criminal career, when living along became 'too much for him', his family said. Fraser's ghost writer James Morton said in The Guardian that over his lifetime the gangster had turned from ‘the scourge of prison governors and warders up and down Britain’ to a minor celebrity. ‘People shook his hand in the street, others kissed him or asked for his autograph and taxi drivers honked their horns,’ Mr Morton wrote. Fraser, pictured left in his police mugshot in the 1960s and right in 1956 before he was jailed for seven years . The gangster claimed to have spent time in every prison in the country. Born in 1923 in Cornwall Road, the baby of his family, Fraser found his calling early in life. 'I began stealing early on and bringing it home, saying I'd found £1 or £2,' he said in his memoirs. 'My mother would say she had the luckiest children, but she would not tell my father because he would have made me take the money down to the police station.' The son of a merchant seaman and a cleaner, Fraser often spoke of his fondness for the days when women and children were untouchable and criminals were only a danger to one another. In a 1994 interview with The Independent, he appeared chuffed to have been dubbed Britain's most dangerous man by not one but two home secretaries. 'Whether I merited that honour, I don't know. Sure I was violent, but only to people like myself ... I suppose I ranked high. I'm quite proud of that,' he said then. A life of crime: How Fraser spent almost half his years in jail after a career spanning the Krays and a nursing home Asbo . He was one of the last surviving 'celebrity criminals' after becoming involved in turf wars between London gangs in the Sixties. 'Mad' Frankie Fraser, who served 42 years in prison for 26 offences, was notorious for his torture methods which involved pulling out enemies teeth with pliers. The 90-year-old former gangster, a grandfather and father-of-four, died today. Fraser was jailed for 10 years in 1967 for his part in the Richardson gang, where he tortured people by pulling out their teeth with pliers if they were disloyal . Fraser dated Marilyn Wiseby, daughter of the Great Train Robber, Tommy Wiseby, for a number of years . In the 1960s, Fraser joined turf wars with the Richardson gang brothers, Eddie (left) and Charlie (right) He had been admitted to King's College Hospital in Denmark Hill, south-east London, for a hip operation but went into a coma last Friday following complications during surgery. Born Francis Fraser, in Lambeth, central London, he has admitted committing crime since he was nine - when he and his sister Eva would steal anything they could. 'You name it, we nicked it,' he said in a documentary of his life - Frankie Fraser’s Last Stand, aired last year. He was charged with his first crime at the age of 13, when he stole a packet of cigarettes and was sent to an approved school. What officers in 1936 did not know then was that his crime spree would continue over a career spanning seven decades. Fraser also worked for notorious gang leader Billy Hill (pictured) who paid him £50 to carry out razor attacks . Fraser, left, pictured with the notorious Richardson brother - Eddie and Charlie, during their reign in the 1960s . He earned his title as 'Mad' Frankie, during the Second World War, when he feigned a mental illness to avoid being called up to the front line. After being released from jail in the Eighties, Frankie Fraser met girlfriend Marilyn Wisbey - daughter of the Great Train Robber, Tommy Wisbey - and they were together until 2001. This was despite Fraser already having a girlfriend, Val, and also a wife, Doreen. He was a father to four sons - Frank, David, Patrick and Francis. One grandson was footballer Tommy Fraser, a former Brighton and Hove Albion, Port Vale and Barnet midfielder who most recently turned out for non-league Peacehaven & Telscombe in East Sussex. The Daily Mail reported in 2008 how the player - who also turned out for Melbourne Knights in Australia - had earned notoriety among team-mates for his links to gangland Britain. Frankie Fraser himself was an Arsenal fan, while another of his grandsons, James Fraser, signed a short-term contract for Bristol Rovers - and played for non-league Worthing. In addition, a third grandson, Anthony Fraser, was arrested in Gibraltar in 2011 over an alleged drug-smuggling plot after a police manhunt. Officials extradited him to Britain - but it’s not clear whether he ever went on trial. Anthony Fraser is the son of Frank Junior, who was jailed for four years in 1999 for possessing cocaine with intent to supply. Another of Frankie Fraser’s sons, David, was also jailed for drugs offences, while grandson Jamie was sent to prison for armed robbery. Frankie Fraser had two other sons, called Patrick and  Francis - with the latter being the only one who never went to jail. He then became involved in serious crime - and the war provided a perfect backdrop with the blackout, rationing and a shortage of police officers. At 17 he was sent to borstal for breaking and entering a hosiery shop in Waterloo, central London, and was then given a 15-month prison sentence for shopbreaking. After the war he was involved in a smash-and-grab raid on a jeweller's and was given a two year prison sentence. In the 1950s he worked for underworld boss Billy Hill and carried out razor attacks on victims for £50 each. He later joined the notorious Richardson gang, formed by brothers Eddie and Charlie, and began carrying out more criminal activities. They set up a fruit machine enterprise, which they would sell to pub landlords, to cover up their crimes. In 1966 he was charged with the murder of Richard Hart, who was shot at a club in Catford, south-east London, but the charges were dropped when a witness changed their testimony. The following year he was involved in a torture trial at the Old Bailey, where members of the gang were charged with electrocuting, whipping and burning those disloyal to them. Fraser himself was charged with pulling out people's teeth with pliers and sentenced to 10 years in prison. During his time behind bars he was involved in violence and was a major instigator in the Parkhurst Prison riots on the Isle of Wight in 1969. Each incident added more time to his sentence. His last jail term ended in 1989, but in 2011 he was handed an Asbo after getting into an argument with a fellow pensioner at his sheltered accommodation in Bermondsey, south-east London. The Richardson brothers - Charlie and Eddie - who formed the self-named gang, which also became known as the torture gang - in the 1960s. The gang were fierce rivals to the notorious Kray twins . He has spent 42 years in prison for 26 offences. His first offence was stealing a pack of cigarettes when he was 13. Here he is pictured greeting Reggie Kray at the funeral of his older brother Charles Junior in 2000 . Even as a pensioner the gangster was unable to keep out of trouble and last year was given an Asbo after he got into an argument with an 87-year-old man for sitting in his favourite armchair at their care home .","Criminal died in London hospital after spending almost half his life in jail .

"The frail mother of a Conservative MP was subjected to ‘disgraceful and shabby’ treatment in a Welsh hospital and later died in an ambulance delayed by equipment shortages. Anne Main says she feels retired hospital worker Rita Wiseman, 80, was ‘let down’ by the NHS, for which she gave her entire working life. Mrs Wiseman was admitted to hospital in May, after showing signs of a stroke, her daughter said. But hospital staff initially failed to diagnose the condition and even tried to send her home. Tory MP Anne Main, left, believes that her mother Rita Wiseman, right, was let down by the NHS in Wales . It was only at Mrs Wiseman’s daughter’s insistence – because of repeated hallucinations, visual impairment and signs of weakness – that she was re-evaluated. A stroke was finally diagnosed after four days in hospital. Yesterday, Mrs Main raised her mother’s case and her ‘concern’ about the state of the Labour-run Welsh NHS in the Commons during Prime Minister’s Question Time. David Cameron told her: ‘The NHS in Wales is in trouble and that is not because of hard-working doctors and nurses, but because of a Labour administration which cut the NHS and failed to reform it.’ Mrs Main told the Mail: ‘What happened to my mother was disgraceful. Nobody listened to her. Without someone advocating on her behalf, nothing would have been done. The staff were lovely but they were run off their feet.’ The ward on which, Mrs Wiseman, widowed from her husband George 20 years ago, stayed was hit by a shortage of basic items such as a water beaker or working television. After spilling water on one occasion, she was refused a change of sheets. A former colleague of Mrs Wiseman also told Mrs Main her mother had been moved to a bed with dirty sheets unchanged from the previous occupant. Mrs Wiseman was discharged a week later and her family told it would be another five weeks before an occupational therapist could visit. She was looked after for six weeks by Mrs Main at her home, before returning to Cardiff to her own home, which had been fitted with a panic button. Her son stayed with her. The day of the occupational therapist’s visit on July 23, Mrs Wiseman had a fall when her son was out collecting prescriptions, and pressed her alarm. It took 15 minutes for initial help to arrive from the council and another 20 minutes for an ambulance. There were ‘substantial’ delays after the paramedics decided to use an inflatable mattress used to protect patients against spinal injuries. There was no valve, so they had to call another ambulance for extra parts. Mrs Wiseman, who had been drifting out of consciousness as she waited, deteriorated further on the way to hospital and was rerouted to resuscitation but died before it could be carried out. Mrs Main wrote to former Welsh Secretary David Jones before her mother’s death in July and later to Welsh Parliamentary Under-Secretary Baroness Randerson. The Tory MP for St Albans said: ‘I was horrified when they initially said my mother was going home before a stroke had been diagnosed. She was so obviously unwell and in my view unfit to be discharged.’ A coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death, saying Mrs Wiseman’s head injuries from the fall were so severe that hospital staff could not have saved her. But Mrs Main said: ‘My mother spent her working life in the NHS, at another Cardiff hospital, St David’s. The hospital where she was treated seems to have gone to rack and ruin.’ Alice Casey, chief operating officer for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: ‘We would like to offer our condolences to the family and sincerely apologise for any distress. The health board is fully committed to investigating and addressing these issues.’ The Welsh Ambulance Service said: ‘We have robust systems in place to ensure faulty equipment is serviced and repaired. We would like to express our sincere condolences.’","A Conservative MP accused the NHS in Wales of 'letting down' her mother .

"A man accused of raping and setting a Kansas woman on fire in Wichita has been charged in her death. Charges against Cornell McNeal, 26, were amended Wednesday to include one count of capital murder or an alternative count of first-degree murder, Sedgwick County District Attorney's Office spokesman Dan Dillon said. Letitia 'Tish' Davis, 36, died on Saturday, a day after McNeal was formally charged with attempted capital murder, rape and arson related to the Nov. 14 attack. Cornell McNeal (pictured left) has bee charged with the murder of Letitia Davis (right) The mother of four suffered burns on more than half her body and cuts on her head. She was found in a Wichita park. McNeal is being held on a $1.25 million bond in Sedgwick County. His attorney, Mark Rudy, didn't immediately return a phone call seeking comment. District Attorney Mark Bennett hasn't decided whether to seek the death penalty. Police said McNeal was linked to the attack by forensic evidence obtained after the woman was taken to a hospital. Investigators believe she was attacked following a 'random encounter' with the man, but no details have been released. Friends of Letitia Davis seen speaking at a vigil for the victim in Fairmont Park in Wichita, Kansas . Sedgwick County District Court records show that a woman whom McNeal had once dated got a protection from abuse order against him in 2007, alleging that after she broke up with him, McNeal had threatened her and had broken windows out at her home and car. That woman is not the same person as the victim in the park case, police said. Court records also indicate McNeal has a criminal history that includes misdemeanor convictions for criminal trespass and theft. He was also charged with battery in a 2009 case that he appealed from municipal court to district court. He eventually pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct and was sentenced to time served.

"Australian vegetarians might be healthier than meat-eaters but they are unhappier . Australian vegetarians might be healthier than meat-eaters but they are unhappier and more prone to mental health disorders, new research suggests. The Alere Wellness Index shows vegetarians drink and smoke less and are more physically active than their carnivorous counterparts. But they are also more likely to have depression and anxiety disorders, according to the Index made up of scores for nutrition, fitness, smoking, alcohol, psychological wellbeing, body mass and medical conditions. Dr John Lang, who developed the wellness index for preventive healthcare company Alere, says the adoption of a vegetarian diet can sometimes follow the onset of mental disorders. 'So the diet isn't the cause but rather the symptom,' he said. 'If you think of people that are committed to being a vegetarian it's a fairly significant commitment and it picks up people at the fringe of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum.' The study, which is based on 50,000 surveys a year conducted by Roy Morgan Research, also shows vegetarians are less optimistic about the future, with 28 per cent more likely to suffer panic attacks and anxiety disorders. They are also 18 per cent more likely to suffer from depression than the general population. The Alere Wellness Index shows vegetarians drink and smoke less and are more physically active than their carnivorous counterparts . The study also shows vegetarians are less optimistic about the future, with 28 per cent more likely to suffer panic attacks and anxiety disorders . In 2012, a German study of more than 4000 vegetarians and meat-eaters linked vegetarianism with higher rates of depression and anxiety. An analysis of the respective ages at adoption of a vegetarian diet and onset of a mental disorder showed that the adoption of the vegetarian diet tends to follow the onset of mental disorders, they concluded. But the good news for vegetarians is that they have the highest nutrition scores - with 105.9 points compared to 100.7 points for meat-eaters. Vegetarian Victoria president Mark Doneddu said he's never felt happier since giving up meat. 'I've been a vegetarian for about 22 years and vegan for the last 18 of those,' he said. He switched from a meat-heavy diet to a vegetarian diet for health reasons. 'I used to get a lot of back pain, asthma and allergies but not anymore. And I've felt a lot healthier and happier generally since I've been a vegetarian. 'Certainly, when you have less pain you tend to feel happier and that's the case for me. I've got more energy as well, I can now run on the beach, which I couldn't do when I was younger.'","The Alere Wellness Index shows vegetarians drink and smoke less than meat-eaters .

Yet despite tonnes of extra fake snow being slapped on fences and trees - and three days of urgent improvements - parents were left equally unimpressed when they showed up at the attraction again today.

I really felt sorry for them after reading about Saturday's disastrous opening and thought they'd pull all the stops out but it is, frankly, c**p.'

But little effort had been made to hide the incomplete construction of the few tatty stalls inside, built from temporary walls, made of wooden planks, sheet wood and facing . Luckily, the train - which was not working on the opening day - was in full operation at the event today . The furore broke out after a barrage of complaints on the first day over elves smoking, rubbish being strewn across the paths and wooden pallets covered in plastic tarpaulin left lying around. The criticism meant the flamboyant TV designer was forced to haul in staff - including an actor playing Santa Claus - for extra training at Belfry Golf Club. Organisers also spent three days getting the attraction in shape while others tried to manage the PR blunder, which even Mr Llewelyn-Bowen dubbed 'Elfgate'. Today, organisers attempted to keep criticism at bay by banning journalists from entering the site. While there were no long queues as there were on Saturday, families were greeted in the car park by workmen who directed them to the entrance. After trudging to the main marquee past fake snow which had dissolved into mud during the previous night's downpour, visitors watched as staff scrambled to open on time. Staff at the attraction have apparently been retrained since the flop on Saturday . Yet visitors were forced to watch the attraction's elves putting on their make-up in the public toilets as panicking staff scrambled to get open . Parents and children were left waiting outside after it opened 20 minutes late which staff said was because of a road accident on the M42 leaving managers stranded in traffic jams .

But it was quickly backed up by San Francisco based software engineer Tom Williams, who was at the conference and wrote on Twitter: 'Travis just compared Uber's Las Vegas regulatory problems with Ferguson. What a weird analogy.' Prompted by Mr Carr to explain, Mr Williams added: 'He compared treatment of uber drivers in Las Vegas by authorities to what happened in Ferguson.' Mr Kalanick's comments made the entire room gasp, Pando's anonymous source said. It comes after Mr Kalanick was forced into damage control mode last week after an Uber executive's suggestion to dig up dirt on reporters who write critically of the car-sharing service. But the very next day Uber was forced to confirm it was investigating whether one of its general managers violated its own privacy policies by snooping on a reporter's ride. Tracked: Buzzfeed claims that Josh Mohrer (left), Uber's New York general manager, tracked technology reporter Johana Bhuiyan on using a feature known as 'God View'. Pictured right is the Uber app . The probe stems from allegations that Josh Mohrer, general manager of Uber's New York office, used a company tracking tool called 'God View' to monitor the location of a BuzzFeed reporter earlier this month. BuzzFeed first reported the investigation. In a statement, Uber said access to the personal data of anyone using its car service is limited to 'legitimate business purposes.' The San Francisco company said employees violating the rules may be disciplined or fired. News of the investigation followed a separate BuzzFeed story, which reported that another Uber executive recently threatened to look into the personal lives of journalists that have criticized Uber. Emil Michael, Uber senior vice president for business, made his remarks in New York during a dinner that was also attended by Mr Kalanick and a list of prominent guests including actor Ed Norton, New York Daily News owner Mort Zuckerman and Huffington Post CEO Arianna Huffington, according to a USA Today column published last Wednesday. The USA Today column was written by Michael Wolff, a prominent journalist, who said he invited BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith to the Uber dinner without informing his guest that all conversations were supposed to be off the record. Wolff said most other guests at the dinner didn't hear the conversation between Michael and Smith. Shocking: Emil Michael (pictured), Uber's senior vice president, reportedly proposed looking into journalists' 'personal lives' and 'families' while in the presence of a BuzzFeed editor at a private dinner in  New York . Under-fire: Ashton Kutcher entered the firestorm surrounding taxi-hiring app Uber . Ashton Kutcher entered the firestorm surrounding under-fire taxi-hiring app Uber and defended controversial comments made by the executive who suggested spending $1million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticise the company. Kutcher, an investor in the app, took to Twitter last Wednesday to show his support for beleaguered VP Emil Michael and described Sarah Lacy, a female journalist who has been highly critical of the company, as 'shady'. 'What is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist?' tweeted the celebrity tech entrepreneur who has invested in tech firms including Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb and Spotify through his venture capital firm A-Grade. So as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts... Yes we should question the source' he continued in a series of tweets before he sought to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not Uber. 'This should be fun... Here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing...' he continued. Mr Michael apologised for his remarks earlier this week. In a series of messages on his Twitter account, Mr Kalanick rebuked his subordinate. 'His remarks showed a lack of leadership, a lack of humanity, and a departure from our values and ideals,' Mr Kalanick tweeted. He also tweeted that he and Mr Michael would learn from their mistakes. The incidents have triggered a wave of tweets calling for a boycott of Uber, whose competition in the rapidly growing car-booking industry includes Sidecar and Lyft.","Travis Kalanick was speaking at private tech conference in Las Vegas .

"A gesture-controlled system claims to be the solution to making smart homes commonplace - even if the devices in your house aren't that smart. Called onecue, the system lets you control your TV, room temperature, lights, blinds and more with the swipe of a hand. But while it syncs with smart technology like Nest and Philips Hue, it can also let you control standard pieces of technology like televisions and set-top boxes. Scroll down for video . An Israeli-based firm has created a smart home system that uses gestures. Called onecue it can sync with existing smart devices like Nest, but it can also be used to control infrared devices like standard TVs. Gestures include closing the palm of your hand to 'air click' and change a TV channel . Developed by Israeli-based company eyeSight, onecue can sync up with many existing smart devices in your home. For now these include Apple TV, Nest Learning Thermostat and Philips Hue, but more are promised in future. Infrared (IR) controlled devices such as TVs, cable and satellite boxes, DVD players and games consoles are supported by onecue. Similar to a universal remote, onecue can ‘learn’ to control most IR remote-controlled devices. For instance, IR-controlled blinds, power switches or power outlets can be controlled with gestures. It also supports Wi-Fi controlled devices such as the Nest thermostat and Philips Hue light bulbs. For best results, the user should face onecue and position themselves within the camera’s line of sight. The ideal distance for interaction is between four and 16ft (1.2 and 4.9 metres). Once a gesture is detected, onecue communicates with configured devices, and it  communicates directly with IR-controlled devices that are in the same room and in the line of sight. And, it can also control Wi-Fi and infrared-enabled devices such as standard TVs, set-top boxes, games consoles and more. The device looks similar to Microsoft's Kinect and works best when it is in the line of sight of the user, so the company suggests using it on a flat surface like a TV. Using hand tracking and gesture recognition technology, it then translates motions into wireless commands. For example, closing and reopening a palm in the air - dubbed an ‘air click' - selects a channel on the TV. Placing a finger to a user's lips mutes the system, while moving a hand up and down can open or close IR-controlled blinds. An LCD display on the front of onecue shows what devices are currently available, and what controls are available. Actions can also be pre-programmed, such as having it turn on multiple devices at once with the wave of a hand. And the device doesn’t need a TV to operate, as the LCD display can provide adequate information on the devices being operated. The device (shown) has an adjustable stand, so it can be used on a variety of flat surfaces. For best results, the user should face onecue and position themselves within the camera’s line of sight. The ideal distance for interaction is between four and 16ft (1.2 and 4.9 metres). The £125 ($199) device will go on sale in early 2015 . The onecue device looks somewhat similar to Microsoft's Kinect (shown) and also, like the device for Xbox One, uses gestures as a means of control . ‘Every device in our homes, from the TV to the games console to the thermostat, has its own control system and remotes, cables or apps for operation, resulting in lots of clutter and fragmentation,’ said Gideon Shmuel, boss of eyeSight. ‘To solve this problem, we developed onecue, a control centre to bring together all of these devices through a natural, easy-to-use interface that leverages our years of experience in gesture recognition technology to let you experience your home through your fingertips.’ And he added that ‘onecue is enabling the Internet of Things right in your home by connecting your devices and making them smarter and easier to use.’ The £125 ($199) device is due to go on sale in early 2015. Using hand tracking and gesture recognition technology, onecue translates motions into wireless commands.

"Children from the poorest families start primary school almost two years behind academically, Nick Clegg warned today. The Deputy Prime Minister said the academic gap between toddlers from different backgrounds can impact on them for the rest of their lives. A £50 million fund is being launched to help boost the academic achievements of nursery schoolchildren from poor families. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured visiting Foresters Primary School in London last week, warned action was needed to stop children falling behind even before they start school . The Early Years Pupil Premium will be aimed at three and four year olds and will be worth around £300 per child. It is based on the pupil premium which is already paid to primary and secondary schools for each child from a low income family. Ministers argue the extra cash will improve the quality of childcare in nurseries, so all children starting school at the age of four are at a similar level of academic ability. Mr Clegg said: 'Every child deserves the chance to fulfil their potential, and this extra funding is a boost to help our youngest children get on in life and succeed. 'Boys and girls from poorer families have often already fallen 19 months behind their better off classmates by the time they hang up their coat on the first day of school. ‘Increasing their chances of success has got to be a top priority.' Nurseries will be able to decide how to use the money, the Department for Education said. A consultation is being launched on exactly how the money will be spent. Education minister Elizabeth Truss, pictured with London Mayor Boris Johnson, said nursery children should need more help with language and communication skills . Education minister Elizabeth Truss said: 'Children from low income families are already behind their peers in language and communication by the age of five - this is not good enough. 'We expect nurseries will use this money to create more high quality nursery provision led by teachers. 'We know it's a challenge to close the attainment gap later on but with the introduction of the Early Years Pupil Premium we hope it will prevent this gap from emerging in the first place.' 4Children chief executive Anne Longfield said: 'There is a real opportunity to use the announcement today as a springboard to maximise the impact of the free early years and childcare places for two-year-olds and the early years pupil premium for three and four-year-olds, and direct support to the most vulnerable pre-school children in a coordinated way that makes a real difference. 'We also think there is a real opportunity for children's centres to be much more involved in delivering this. 'The Early Years Pupil Premium needs to be increased during the next parliament to the same amount per head as a primary school child would be allocated. As we approach the next general election the challenge is for all political parties to set out how they will provide the support we know families need towards making Britain great for children and families.'","Toddlers from low income families struggle with communication skills .

"Fresh off the back of winning its $1bn court battle against tech rival Samsung Electronics Ltd, Apple  is launching yet another lawsuit alleging further infringement. Apple has asked a federal court in a separate case to find that four additional Samsung products, including the Galaxy S III, violate the tech giant's patents. In February, Apple claimed that at least 17 Samsung products infringe its patents. In a court filing made in San Jose federal court on Friday, Apple added four more products to the list of allegedly infringing products that have been released beginning in August 2011 and continuing through this month. Fresh off the back of winning its $1bn court battle against tech rival Samsung Electronics Ltd, Apple Inc is launching yet another lawsuit alleging further infringement . Among the products named are the Galaxy S III, Samsung's flagship smartphone, and the Galaxy Note. Apple won a major victory over Samsung last Friday in a separate case when a jury found that the South Korean company had copied critical features of the hugely popular iPhone and iPad and awarded the U.S. company $1.05 billion in damages. Samsung representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Since Apple's victory in  proving Samsung did copy their smartphone technology Google chief Larry Page and Apple CEO Tim Cook have been locked in behind-the-scenes talks. The two executives had a phone conversation last week, the sources said, amid speculation the search giant could be next in Apple's sights. Discussions involving lower-level officials of the two companies are also ongoing. Included in the lawsuit: Jean-Daniel Ayme, vice president European Telecom Operations at Samsung Electronics explains the new Galaxy Note II features at a Samsung Mobile Unpacked 2012 event . Last Friday, a jury awarded Apple the hefty sum of damages and set the stage for a possible ban on sales of some Samsung products, most of which use Google's Android software. Many have viewed the case as a 'proxy war' between Apple and Google. The Android software first came out on the market when Google's then-CEO Eric Schmidt was serving on the Apple board. The Associated Press reported that after shoving Schmidt off Apple's board, Steve Jobs vowed that Apple would resort to 'thermonuclear war' to destroy Android and its allies. He declared Android a 'stolen product'. While Jobs is no longer at the helm of Apple and their ensuing legal battles, his determination to kill the Android software platform may be ingrained in the corporate mindset. Secret talks: Google chief Larry Page, left, and Apple CEO Tim Cook are reportedly holding discussions about mobile patent disputes between the two technology giants . Page and Cook are expected to talk again in the coming weeks, though no firm date has been set, the sources said on Thursday. One of the sources told Reuters that a meeting had been scheduled for this Friday, but had been delayed for reasons that were unclear. Google was forced to issue a statement on Monday following the judge's ruling, to shareholders. It said the portions of Samsung's smartphones which were found to be copied do not apply to their software. If that is the case, then Apple will have no case against Google. 'The court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims. Most of these don't relate to the core Android operating system, and several are being re-examined by the US Patent Office,' the statement said. Apple on Monday gave a federal judge a . list of eight Samsung Electronics Co. products it wants pulled from . shelves and banned from the U.S. market, including popular Galaxy model . smartphones. The products Apple wants out are all . smartphones: Galaxy S 4G, Galaxy S2 AT&T, Galaxy S2, Galaxy S2 . T-Mobile, Galaxy S2 Epic 4G, Galaxy S Showcase, Droid Charge and Galaxy . Prevail. Last week a Californian court decided that Apple's . iPad was copied by Samsung Electronics' Galaxy tablet 10.1 (right) and . that the South Korean firm must pay over $1 billion in damages . The judge has scheduled a September 20 hearing to discuss Apple's demands for the sales bans. One possible scenario under consideration could be a truce involving disputes over basic features and functions in the Android mobile software, one source said. The 'pinch-and-zoom' feature now used on most smartphones and tablets is particularly under threat following the patent infringement battle. Scorched earth: Steve Jobs was said to promise 'thermonuclear war' against Google after then-CEO Eric Schmidt (right) was on Apple's board when Google released their Android software . But it was unclear whether Page and Cook were discussing a broad settlement of the various disputes between the two companies, most of which involve the burgeoning mobile computing area, or are focused on a more limited set of issues. Competition between Google and Apple has heated up in recent years with the shift from PCs to mobile devices. The popularity of the software has . been in tandem with tit-for-tat patent infringement lawsuits slung by both sides. The . latest complaint was filed by Motorola Mobility, now a unit of Google, . against Apple at the U.S. International Trade Commission claiming some . features of Apple's devices infringe on its patents. Claims: Apple filed its lawsuit in April of last . year alleging that 28 Samsung smartphones and computer tablets had . 'slavishly copied' the iPhones and iPads . A previous lawsuit between the two in a Chicago court was thrown out by a federal judge, who said neither side could prove damages. Apple in recent months has moved to lessen its reliance on Google's products. Apple recently unveiled its own mobile mapping software, replacing the Google product used in the iPhone, and said it would no longer offer Google's YouTube as a pre-loaded app in future versions of its iPhone. Cook took the helm at Apple a year ago, and Page stepped into the top job at Google a few months before that. The conversation between Page and Cook last week did not result in any formal agreement, but the two executives agreed to continue talking, according to one source. Google's Larry Page, who sat out several public speaking engagements earlier this summer because of an unspecified medical condition affecting his voice, has continued to run Google's business. Apple and Google declined to comment on any discussions.","Last week Apple won a court battle over Samsung, and was awarded $1.05billion in patent lawsuit .

"Amir Beheshti, 40, has been trying to get refugee status for seven years, but was repeatedly turned down by the courts, who ruled he would not suffer if he returned to his home country Iran . A failed asylum seeker who has dodged deportation from Britain for nearly a decade has been told he can stay – because he goes to the gym. Amir Beheshti, 40, has been trying to get refugee status for seven years, but was repeatedly turned down by the courts, who ruled he would not suffer if he returned to his home country Iran. But he has now told judges he has a private life that involves going for work-outs with his friends – which means his human rights would be violated if he was deported. The controversial legal ruling by . Scotland’s Court of Session means he will be allowed to continue living . rent-free in his publicly funded flat and claiming a weekly allowance. Earlier this month, a top Scottish . judge issued a written decision in which he agreed the case should be . referred back to Home Secretary Theresa May for fresh consideration. This effectively means the threat of deportation has been removed and Beheshti is free to remain in Scotland indefinitely. Lord Glennie’s judgment read: ‘He had . integrated well within the Glasgow community, had a large network of . friends, most of whom were Scottish, and socialised with those friends . at the gymnasium, at five-a-side football, in coffee shops, at college, . in the library and at their homes. ‘He went on to say that he made use of local facilities, such as the library and Glasgow leisure centres'. Beheshti’s claim, it said, was ‘based . on Article 8 ECHR and, in particular, on the fact that he had, so he . claimed, established a private life in the UK. Beheshti was smuggled into Dover on a lorry in 2005. In his asylum application he claimed . his father’s pro-Jewish sympathies put him in danger in Iran – but it . was rejected, as were two appeals. In his asylum application he claimed . his father’s pro-Jewish sympathies put him in danger in Iran – but it . was rejected, as were two appeals. Having travelled to Glasgow, where he . lived with his sister for two years, he appealed to the Court of . Session. But in June 2009, Lord Osborne ruled he had consistently failed . to provide any ‘credible’ evidence that he would personally face any . persecution or disadvantage in Iran. Beheshti was smuggled into Dover (pictured) on a lorry in 2005. In his asylum application he claimed his father's pro-Jewish sympathies put him in danger in Iran - but it was rejected, as were two appeals . The decision marked the end of Beheshti’s rights of appeal. Technically, he should then have been removed as an illegal immigrant, but no action to deport him was taken. Lord Glennie's ruling effectively means the threat of deportation has been removed and Beheshti is free to remain in Scotland indefinitely . In February 2010, Beheshti wrote to . UKBA, asking for ‘leave to remain’ based on Article 8 ECHR. When that . was rejected, he launched another appeal to the Court of Session. This . appeal was the one that led to him being allowed to stay. Beheshti said recently that he ‘feels comfortable’ in Glasgow and does not have anybody left back in Iran. Last night, his case - which has already cost the public purse tens of thousands of pounds - sparked outrage. Emma Boon of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, . said: ‘If the occasional trip to the gym is enough to allow a failed . asylum seeker to appeal his deportation, then taxpayers will wonder who . can’t claim a right to stay. ‘He . should have been deported when his case was initially rejected. It’s . appalling that we are left picking up all of his bills when he should . have been sent home years ago'. A UK Border Agency (UKBA) spokesman said: ‘Too often, Article 8 [of the European Convention on Human Rights, guaranteeing the right to a private and family life] has been used to place the family rights of illegal migrants above the rights of the British public in seeing our immigration laws properly enforced, and that balance needs to be redressed. ‘The Government will change the immigration rules to reinforce the public interest in seeing those who have breached our immigration laws removed from this country. ‘We have been seeking to remove this individual, but we have been asked by the courts to look again at this case. ‘Where we do not believe someone has the right to stay in this country, we expect them to return home'. Partners: Bolivian immigrant Mr Soria (left) with British librarian Frank Trew . Camilo Renzo Soria found himself at the centre of the 'catgate' scandal earlier this month when Home Secretary Teresa May used the Bolivian as an example to illustrate how easy it is for illegal immigrants to not be deported. The 36-year-old's cat, Maya, was the reason he was not kicked out, May, angling to ditch the controversial Human Rights Act, claimed. But Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke clashed with May at the Tory Party Conference and stood . up for Soria. He angered the Conservatives by deriding her claim of the cat’s importance to the case as ‘laughable’ and ‘complete nonsense’ - and though he was correct he was roundly criticised. Soria, a trained architect who had been in the country since 2002, stayed illegally in Britain for . more than two years after his student visa expired. His situation came to the . attention of the authorities in 2007 when he was accused of shoplifting an ornamental cat. Catgate: The feline, Maya, who helped persuade a judge that Soria should be allowed to remain in Britain . But he fought off a Home Office move to deport him, arguing that his joint ownership of Maya with British librarian Frank Trew,  a 49-year-old Oxford graduate, showed the seriousness of their relationship. 'When we got Maya in 2005 we never thought it would lead to a national incident,' he said. 'But even after all that's happened I don't regret getting Maya. 'I have always worked. I have paid my tax and National Insurance and I have never claimed benefits.' Soria has now enlisted the services of PR guru Neil Reading, who has often brokered lucrative deals between celebrities and newspapers in the past. He and Mr Trew live together in a rented £220,000 flat and are intending to enter into a civil partnership in May or June next year.","Was smuggled into Dover on a lorry in 2005 .

"More than a million UK customers of  Net-A-Porter have been left disappointed after the fashion site crashed just hours after launching its end of season sale. The webpage announced the start of its US sale at around 11am UK time, but just one hour later a message began appearing on the site saying the page was unavailable. Frustrated browsers began posting on social media, with some complaining they had been booted off the site before being able to pay for the items in their shopping cart. Denied: Customers trying to access the Net-A-Porter site have been faced with this message after the page crashed just an hour into their end of season sale . User Chrissy Rutherford wrote: 'Can the Net-A-Porter sale work yet? I'll cry if I lose my cart.' Meanwhile Monroe Steele tried to make light of the situation by adding: 'Well the site is down so I guess that's God's way of telling me to keep my money.' The company's Twitter feed is asking shoppers to send a direct message with their details so the customer service team can contact them, but is not saying how long the issue will take to fix. Speaking to Mail Online, a Net-A-Porter spokesman blamed high demand for the crash. Anger: Net-A-Porter has been advising frustrated shoppers to send their details over in a private message on Twitter, but there is no word on how long it will take the site to go back online . Discounts: The crash comes just days ahead of Cyber Monday, the biggest online shopping day of the year, with UK customers expected to spend £649million in 24 hours . The crash comes just days ahead of Cyber Monday on December 1, the biggest online shopping day of the year, with British shoppers making 7.7million purchases worth around £600million in just 24 hours last year. This year that number is expected to jump significantly as more UK retailers promote heavy discounts, with £649.6million expected to be spent. Net-A-Porter is a  fashion company that has 6million visitors to its site every month, with just over 1million of those coming from the UK. The site is also popular in Australia and Hong Kong, and draws customers from other parts of Europe such as Germany and France. From one computer in a Chelsea apartment to office blocks in London, New York and Hong Kong: The rise of Net-A-Porter . Natalie Massenet, founder of Net-A-Porter, who sold the business for £350million in 2010 . Back in the year 2000, when Natalie Massenet first floated the idea of an online store for high fashion, internet shopping was in its infancy. Wireless had yet to break into the mainstream, and most people had not yet conceived of a world in which people could shop from their phones, let alone tablet computers. So when Ms Massenet suggested launching a website selling high fashion labels, she was laughed at, with investors refusing to believe that women would ever use the service. Despite this, she decided to press ahead with the idea, and set up a webpage linked to a single computer in an apartment she had rented in Chelsea. Orders came through to Ms Massenet and her team of 15 staff via a painfully slow dial-up connection. All of the stock was piled at the back of the room, and it was up to this small team to make sure everything was packaged and sent out correctly. The workload was punishing, made worse by the fact that Ms Massenet was pregnant at the time. In newspaper interviews since, she has confessed to crying every night during the first year, unable to cope with the pressure. She needn't have worried. The site was an online shopping revolution, rolling designer boutique and glossy magazine into the one product, and sales took off. In 2010 Ms Massenet sold the business to luxury group Richemont, whose stable includes luxury brands Cartier and Montblanc, for £350million - pocketing around £50million herself. At the time, she said: 'There were a lot of unimaginative private-equity people who said that women would never shop online. 'I think about those people a lot. I'm sure their wives are having Net-a-porter bags delivered to their homes every day.' Today, the website attracts 6million visitors a month from as far afield as the U.S., Hong Kong, Australia, France and Russia. Of those around 62 per cent buy all of their clothes online, with more than half using a tablet and 48 per cent using a smartphone. These days Net-A-Porter employs more than 2,000 people in offices from New York to Hong Kong. Meanwhile Ms Massenet, who is half English and half American, has been named one of the most influential women in fashion.","More than a million UK customers of Net-A-Porter blocked from website .

"Tony Blair has taken a swipe at Labour leader Ed Miliband – suggesting he had thrown away the chance of a ‘substantial majority' by dragging the party to the left. The former Prime Minister said a ‘strong’ leader who appealed to voters’ ‘aspiration’ could defeat David Cameron. Mr Blair’s remarks came after Labour was accused of launching ‘class war’ by attacking private schools and pledging to introduce a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister said Labour could win a 'substantial majority' from the centre ground of politics . He refused to be drawn on Labour’s struggle in the polls, but said: 'I still believe personally there is still a majority for centre-ground politics in the UK. ‘If you had a strong political lead that was combining the politics of aspiration with the politics of compassion, I still think that’s where you could get a substantial majority.’ The former Prime Minister also urged Mr Miliband not to try to ‘out Ukip Ukip’ by attacking immigration and the European Union. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, he said: 'I’ve always thought that the Labour Party would not lose by standing up strongly for Britain’s membership of the European Union. 'That’s been my view all the way through. I’m not saying that with the rise of UKIP there isn’t a strong anti-EU vote, there is.’ He added: 'My view is and has been right from the very beginning that the way to deal with a party like UKIP, to analyze their policies, show how destructive they would be.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband has been accused of running a 'core vote' strategy by only appealing to left-wing voters . He said Labour had to offer policies which focussed on ‘genuinely helping people’ find work rather than blaming Poles for taking jobs. Mr Blair urged the party not to join Ukip ‘selling people a false and illusory elixir of hope, which is around if you stop more Polish people coming to Britain you’re going to provide more jobs in the poorest communities in the UK’. He added: 'You’re not. That’s not the answer.’ He added: 'I’ve always said the right way to deal with immigration is to have answers to it that meet the concerns people have, but also to point out the positive benefits of immigration.' Conservative Vice-Chairman Bob Neill MP said Mr Blair’s remarks exposed the growing concern over Mr Miliband’s leadership. He said: ‘For all his many many faults Tony Blair was still Labour’s most electorally successful leader, but even he thinks Ed Miliband’s just not up to it. ‘Across the country and inside the Labour party people realise that Ed Miliband is a weak leader whose policies of more wasteful spending and higher taxes don’t add up to a credible economic plan.’","Former PM called for 'strong' political lead to appeal to voters' 'aspiration'

"Officers later obtained CCTV footage on the train to help identify Neil Docherty, 43, after passenger complaints . An investment banker racially abused a woman on a late-night train, saying: 'Go back to your own f*****g country.' Neil Docherty, 43, of Linlithgow, West Lothian, also slapped the woman on the head on the Glasgow to Edinburgh rail service, a court heard. And he ignored a female passenger who told him to shut up over his racist rant and said: 'It'll be a different story when they take over the world and you're all wearing burkhas!' He later alighted from the carriage, but irate on-lookers aboard took Docherty's photo on a camera phone – and helped the authorities track down the investment banker. Docherty appeared in Livingston Sheriff Court today on a bail undertaking and pled guilty to two racially aggravated offences. He admitted assaulting Fella Hammach, 33, on board the train at Linithgow, West Lothian, on August 28. He also admitted acting in a racially aggravated manner which caused or was intended to cause alarm and distress to Ms Hammach by shouting and swearing, acting in an aggressive manner and directing religious remarks towards her using racially offensive language. Catherine Knowles, prosecuting, said the assault was witnessed by several passengers on the train, which was packed with revellers returning from a night out. As the train pulled into Linlithgow station at around 11pm Ms Hammach was unexpectedly slapped to the right side of her head from behind. Ms Knowles said: 'The accused was overheard shouting at her: 'Go back to your own fucking country. Muslim men are raping women'. The prosecutor added a female passenger told the accused to shut up, but he ignored her and shouted: 'It'll be a different story when they take over the world and you're all wearing burkhas!' He continued to make racial comments until he left the train at Linlithgow station. Court heard investment banker Docherty told a female passenger on the train who complained over racist rant to shut up and added: 'It'll be a different story when they take over the world and you're all wearing burkhas!' Mrs Knowles said a passenger collected the names and contact details of everyone who had witnessed the incident and passed them to the conductor who contacted British Transport Police. Officers were waiting at Edinburgh to take statements from the travellers and a copy of the camera phone image. They later obtained CCTV footage from the train.

"Vice President Joe Biden threatened reporters Saturday with a water gun. Biden pulled the water pistol on members of the press during the annual media picnic at his official residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. ‘Anybody who writes a bad story about me is dead,’ he said while holding the gun. ‘I just want you to know that, get this straight, we’re not gonna kid around about this.’ Joking around: Vice President Joe Biden threatened White House reporters Saturday with a water gun . Biden cracked a wide grin while the crowd around him roared with laughter. A platoon of water-gun wielding children then joined him in soaking press corps, according to tweets from a variety of reporters. ‘The Vice President of the US just shot me with a super soaker,’ wrote the Associated Press’ White House reporter Josh Lederman. Another video by Slate’s Dave Weigel shows the veep and a grandson of his shooting each other with the water guns. ‘I am your grandfather, what are you doing,’ Biden can be heard asking. The annual event was attended by members of the media, their families, the vice president and his family. It also featured live music, an inflatable obstacle course and a bungee bounce, according to various other tweets from the event.","Vice President Joe Biden made the joke threat during the annual White House Press Corps media picnic .

"European migrants should be banned from claiming benefits until they have paid taxes for at least six months, Nick Clegg has said in a toughening of Lib Dem policy on immigration. The Deputy Prime Minister also suggests in-work benefits like tax credits should only be available to people working full-time on the minimum wage. It marks an escalation in the political arms race to get tough on immigration marked by the rise of Ukip, and comes ahead of David Cameron's long-awaited speech on how he wants to cap the total number of people who can come to Britain from Europe. Scroll down for video . Deputy PM Nick Clegg, speaking in Berlin today, has become the latest party leader to toughen his stand on benefits for migrants . Mr Clegg insists that benefits for EU migrants can be curbed without 'tearing up' freedom of movement rules within the 28-member bloc. Downing Street has made clear that Mr Cameron wants to be able to tackle the numbers of people who can move from other EU countries, as well as limiting access to the welfare state. But Mr Clegg warned the Tories were in danger of making 'irresponsible declarations' on Europe in a bid to quell unrest at the rise of Ukip. Instead the Liberal Democrat leader insisted the UK could find allies in Europe to support efforts to tackle so-called 'benefits tourism' without challenging the key principle of free movement which is regarded as non-negotiable by countries including Germany. Mr Clegg suggested that migrants could be prevented from claiming the new universal credit until they have 'worked and contributed' to the system. Under the Lib Dem plan, they would have had to work in the UK for six months before being able to claim the new Universal Credit and then claims would stop after six months. He also proposed restricting access to in-work benefits like tax credits, suggesting that migrants could be required to work the equivalent of full-time hours on the minimum wage in order to qualify. This would mean earnings would have to be £227-a-week, instead of the current £153. Mr Clegg warned the Prime Minister's speech could put the British economy at risk if he proposes measures which would jeopardise the country's EU membership in an effort to win back supporters from Nigel Farage's Ukip. Mr Clegg set out details of his plans to curb access to benefits ahead of talks with German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel in Berlin . Latest figures show that almost 65,000 people from the EU were claiming jobseekers allowance in February this year . TORIES . A limit on the number of EU migrants who can come to Britain . EU migrants banned from claiming universal credit, which replaces the main out-of-work benefits and tax credits . LIB DEMS . No benefits through Universal Credit until claimants have worked for six months, and claims then limited to six months . Restricting access to in-work benefits like tax credits to those migrants who work the equivalent of full-time hours on the minimum wage . Paying child benefit at the rate of home countries, so a Polish worker would get £18 not £80-a-month for a family back home. Wants to stop exporting child benefit altogether . LABOUR . Increasing the time EU jobseekers must wait before claiming out-of-work benefits from three months to two years. Changing rules on in-work benefits to stop employers using tax credits to top up low wages for temporary workers . Ending the 'absurdity' of child benefit and child tax credits being paid to workers in the UK for children living elsewhere in the EU . Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Clegg said Mr Farage wanted to 'pull up the drawbridge' and acknowledged it was a 'message that has played well' in the by-elections in Clacton and Rochester and Strood. But he said: 'The bigger danger now is that a rattled Conservative party resorts to equally irresponsible declarations, in a bid to calm their own ranks. 'David Cameron will soon give his much built-up immigration speech. If the Prime Minister asserts that a Tory government will introduce caps or overall quotas on the number of EU migrants coming here, we will find ourselves in the worst of all worlds. 'Ukip will say it is not enough. Europe will say it is not possible. Once again the British people will be plunged into a cycle of wild overpromising and inevitable disappointment, their scepticism confirmed. And the risks to the openness of the British economy will be considerable.' Mr Clegg said it would be possible to work with allies in Europe to secure reform within the existing freedom of movement rules. The Deputy Prime Minister, who was expected to discuss the issue German vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel during a visit to Berlin, said: 'I have already proposed that we work with other states to stop EU migrants from claiming child benefit for children who are not living here. 'As a first step, we should pay the same rate as the country in which those children reside. In the UK it is about £80 a month, whereas in Poland it is less than half that. And there are other proposals we must now explore. 'As we streamline our welfare system by combining a range of benefits in a single Universal Credit, we should make sure that only migrants who have worked and contributed can receive the support. 'New jobseekers should not be eligible. Applying the same principle - that support should be reserved for migrants who are paying something into the pot - we should look at increasing the earnings threshold for in-work benefits such as tax credits. EU migrants could, for example, be required to work the equivalent of full-time hours on the minimum wage in order to qualify.' He said Germany was pursuing five year re-entry bans for migrants involved in identity or benefit fraud, suggesting that 'we must see if we can strengthen our laws as well'. Crucially, he said these measures could be pursued 'without tearing up the freedom to move across Europe or threatening to pull out of the EU'. 'The choice is clear,' he said. 'We can feed people ever more irresponsible claims about immigration, raising hopes only to dash them in the end. Or - far better - we can reform the rules to address people's legitimate concerns, while safeguarding our open economy too.' Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary,said: 'You can't trust a word the Lib Dems say. If Nick Clegg were really serious he would support Labour's plan to make fairness and contribution central to Britain's welfare system. 'Labour would stop child benefit being sent abroad, restrict out of work benefits for EU migrants for two years, and ensure that there are fair rules in place for in-work benefits for those coming from outside the UK.'","Deputy PM becomes latest party leader to toughen his stance on migrants .

"The moment thieves chased a terrified puppy in front of a family's home - before stealing the valuable pooch - was captured by a neighbour's CCTV camera. Peaches, a seven-month-old pug, was bought to cheer up Ellis Barrett, six, after he came out of hospital in February. The little boy has spent the last four years undergoing surgery after contracting septicaemia, following a horrific incident when he was scalded with hot water. Now he has been left heartbroken by the news that his 'best friend' has been taken from him, said his mother Lucy Swift. 'He’s devastated she’s gone and all we want is to find her.' Scroll down for video . Puppy love: Lucy Swift (pictured right with Ellis) bought Peaches the pug (left) to cheer up her six-year-old son . Caught: One of the hooded thieves is captured on CCTV chasing Peaches (bottom right) around the driveway before stealing the dog . Miss Swift, 29, worked extra shifts as a carer for the elderly until she . saved the money to buy the pug, which can cost between £800 and £1200. 'Ellis had been asking for a pug for months but when I saw how expensive they were I couldn’t believe it,' she said. 'I worked as much as I could to get her . and when Ellis came out of hospital in February I could . finally give him his pug.' The valuable pet was stolen from the family home in Batley, West Yorkshire, on Sunday afternoon after she had been let out into the front garden.

'When anyone calls her name she gets so excited and so giddy that she pees so people will know it is her.' The distraught mother explained that the beloved pet isn't microchipped as the dog was too small when she was first taken to the vet.

"Sports agent: Leigh Steinberg cites struggles with alcoholism as well as legal difficulties for his bankruptcy . Sports agent Leigh Steinberg, who represented many of the NFL's biggest stars and was the inspiration for the movie Jerry Maguire, has filed for bankruptcy protection. Known as the first super agent, Steinberg said on Wednesday that he takes responsibility for debts of several million dollars. 'I just lost track while I was in rehab,' he said. He has struggled with alcohol for years but has been sober since 2010. He blamed his alcohol problems on the breakdown of his marriage. He divorced his wife in 2006. His attorneys filed the Chapter 7 petition late yesterday in federal bankruptcy court in Santa Ana, California . The filing comes weeks after an Orange County Superior Court commissioner authorized but didn't issue a bench warrant for Steinberg after he failed to appear in court in a case involving a $1.4 million debt. The 62-year-old said his attorney agreed to change the date of a hearing, told him not to show up and then failed to reschedule. Court documents show a default judgment ordered Steinberg to pay the Irvine Co. for office space he leased in Newport Beach. The agent said his debts are larger than the $1.4 million owed to the Irvine Co., and that his attorneys are still compiling the total. He said his only assets are some stock. Steinberg began his career in 1975 has represented NFL stars such as Troy Aikman, Warren Moon, Steve Young and Ben Roethlisberger. He was the inspiration for Tom Cruise's character in 1996's Jerry Maguire. The movie turned 'Show me the money!' into an enduring catchphrase. Success: Former quarterbacks Steve Young, left, and Warren Moon, right, with their one-time sports agent Leigh Steinberg at a party in 2006 . Art imitates life: Steinberg was the inspiration behind the 1996 movie Jerry Maguire starring Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr . Steinberg issued a statement shortly after the filing. He said he delayed filing for bankruptcy for several years 'because of my moral and legal obligation to people who advanced me funds or performed services in good faith. But the constant and aggressive collection efforts and press initiatives undertaken by creditors have harassed my family and prevented me from working to be able to pay these debts'. He said prospective clients have been pushed away after hearing of his debts. 'It doesn't seem logical to prevent a person who owes you money from working in their chosen field by attempting to ruin his reputation, but that is what has happened,' he said. 'I have lived with this in recent years, and it is time to follow a more constructive path.' Steinberg said he struggled with alcohol. In the past five or six years, 'I began to check out episodically for short periods. 'My judgment and oversight of my affairs was not consistent and at times impaired. I am responsible for my own addiction — no one forced me to drink — and in revealing my struggle with alcoholism, I am in no way justifying or excusing my circumstance. Recent: Steinberg was pictured with Serena Williams at a 25th Annual Super Bowl Party on February 5, 2011 in Dallas, Texas . Jerry Maguire, right, based on Steinberg, turned the phrase 'Show me the money' into a popular catchphrase . 'But I discuss it to provide context . as well as understanding and inspiration to those who also battle . addictive behavior. I surrendered to the reality that I was an alcoholic . and my behavior was impacting family and associates in March 2010. 'I . surrendered to the concept that until I tackled alcoholism, other . priorities needed to be put aside. ... I am responsible for these debts. But my priority was sobriety, and I have been continuously sober since . that time.' The agent said the underlying cause of his inability to earn money and resolve his debt situation occurred in 2003. 'One . of my employees admitted that — without my knowledge — he had taken a . $300,000 loan from one of our NFL clients,' Steinberg said in his . statement. 'It was exactly the kind of transaction that I had . specifically forbidden, and it violated NFL Players Association . regulations. 'The . NFL player understandably fired me, then went to a rival agency. As a . matter of background, you should know that this company is run by an . agent who used to work at our firm. Fame: Leigh Steinberg has represented NFL stars such as troy Aikman, Warren Moon, Steve Young and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, right, over his lengthy career . 'We filed a lawsuit to challenge the way this agent had left our firm, and we won. Two attorneys on the losing side are involved in the current case concerning my debt.' Ten years ago, Steinberg had a bitter legal fight with former partner David Dunn, who took dozens of NFL player clients and formed his own agency. 'Since then, I have made repeated offers to repay the player far more than the original $300,000,' the statement continued. 'There are many legal complexities, but in a nutshell, his representatives — the ones who lost the lawsuit — have insisted on collecting monies without informing the NFLPA that the matter is settled. 'This point is crucial because I did not apply for recertification by the union after one of their agents (and his wife) filed suit against me in 2006. 'If I cannot be recertified, I cannot work in the field that I have been trained in, which is to the benefit of this rival agent. 'Keeping me out of business seems to be a priority above collecting the debt, and although substantial payments have been made, the demand is now four times the original amount. My attempts to rebuild my life have been hamstrung. 'I have attempted to make amends for damage my drinking caused to others. I believe that I have many productive years ahead and hope through this process that once again I will be able to make a positive impact on athletes and the world.'","Leigh Steinberg has debts of several million dollars .

"With his lightning strike in the USA’s opening World Cup match, Clint Dempsey finally moved out of the shadow of his celebrated colleague Landon Donovan. The goal, scored just 29 seconds after kick off helping to secure victory over long-time rival Ghana, was the fastest ever by a US player. But it was a gesture during his celebrations just seconds after the ball hit the net that gives a glimpse into the two tragedies in the player’s life that have driven the newly dubbed Captain America to success. As he ran around the pitch he looked up and then raised his fingers to the sky. Scroll down for video... Sign of love: Team USA's World Cup soccer superstar Clint Dempsey pays tribute to both his sister and his former friend, both of whom died young and in heartbreaking circumstances by pointing his fingers skyward . Family tragedy: Jennifer Dempsey (right) was primed to be a professional tennis player when her life was tragically cut short after suffering a brain aneurism . It is his unique tribute to both his sister Jennifer and his former friend – both of whom died young and in heartbreaking circumstances. Dempsey’s rise to the top of US soccer - the only US player to have scored in three consecutive World Cup campaigns - is a remarkable rags-to-riches story that would be considered far-fetched if it were a Hollywood script. Now 31, he was brought up in the family's trailer in the backyard of his grandparents' home on the outskirts of Nacogdoches, a small town in East Texas. The fourth of five children, he and his older brother Ryan became hooked on soccer after watching Hispanic boys from his neighborhood kicking around a basketball with their bare feet on a dirt field. Rolled-up socks were used as goalposts. Happy days: Clint enjoys a fun vacation with his family in North Carolina . Braveheart: Clint's brother Ryan pays tribute to Jennifer in his own way: he has an intricate  tattoo of her face surrounded by flowers engraved on his chest . Forgoing traditional American sports, he threw himself into the game. It was not long before his family recognized his talent, and when he turned 10 they decided to see if others saw it too. His father, Aubrey, a carpenter, drove him for three hours to Dallas to trials for a local club team called the Longhorns. The manager threw a ball to the young Dempsey, watched him trap it and then juggle it with his feet, and immediately he also was a believer. Two or three times a week the family embarked on the six-hour round trip and his dad sold his boat and guns to pay for the gas money. His mother, a nurse, worked every overtime shift she could and the family forewent their annual holiday. Special occasions were spent in McDonald’s, the five siblings sharing one meal between them. 'My parents were crazy,' said Dempsey told the Guardian. 'They just wanted to do everything they could for their kids.' Sacrifice: Clint's mother, a nurse, worked every overtime shift she could and the family forewent their annual holiday to launch his soccer career . But the family had another budding sports star in their midst and something had to give. His elder sister Jennifer was so good at tennis she was about to turn professional and the family made the difficult decision to pull him out of the league and direct resources to her. The decision left the 12-year-old “upset and angry' but he accepted it because he was very close to his sister. But that heartache was nothing compared with what was to come. Soon after the decision,  his sister, then 16, had fainted and been rushed to hospital. She had actually suffered a brain aneurism and needed surgery. He arrived at the hospital after everybody else and was told that his sister had not made it through. “They tell you and your heart falls from your chest,” he told the Guardian. 'You hit the ground and you cry for hours. You cry until your head aches.' While the tragedy still hurts today, it allowed him to resume his football career and made him even more determined to succeed. Special occasions: The five siblings shared one meal between them at MacDonald's to save for Clint's training. His father, Aubrey, a carpenter, drove him to Dallas - six hours round-tip - to a local club team . Dempsey explained that he had earlier spoken to his sister about death and she had said that if she died “I will help you get the ball in the net.' 'And that's why I look up to the sky now when I score - to remember her,' he said. He played with even more intensity when he returned to Dallas and won a place at Furman University, a small private institution, in South Carolina, on a sports scholarship. Farshid Niroumand, his coach at Nacogdoches High School, said he was 'consumed’ by the game. 'He was playing two or three years above his age and yet it still was not enough. He always wanted to challenge himself. 'He was so hungry for success. I think he still is. There was a fire inside him.' At about this time, he became close friends with a Hispanic teenager named Victor Rivera Jr. 'They started out as rivals but became friends,' said Niroumand. 'They were good for each other. They pushed each other.' While Dempsey made the cut for university, Rivera just missed out and trained to be policeman. It was to lead to the second major tragedy in Dempsey’s life. Just days before he was to take up his post, Rivera accidentally shot himself in the head – his gun going off as he picked up an ear plug from the floor. Team USA: Dempsey hangs out with his sister Crystal Couch and baby . Once again, Dempsey was devastated, but once again he channeled the emotion to better himself at football. And in tribute to his old friend he also holds up a finger after scoring. 'People just see Clint’s passion, they don't see how compassionate and caring he is,' Niroumand said. 'They don't realize what he has gone through.' At Furman University, Dempsey thrived so much that the New England Revolution, based near Boston, signed him before he even graduated. From there he became one of the first American outfield players to move to the English Premier League, considered by many to be the best in the world. He started at Fulham, a small London based club, and had to overcome prejudice from sceptical English players and fans, who did not consider the USA a serious footballing nation. He thrived so much that bigger rivals Tottenham Hotspur poached him. But the tight, aggressive English game, did not always suit his maverick and flamboyant style. By now married and with three kids he decided to return to the USA and joined the Seattle Sounders, where he currently plays. Doug Allison, the English-born coach at Furman University, said: 'He was confident but he was also always working on his game. Bestie: Victor Rivera Jr. (No. 13 top left) started out as Clint's rival but they ended up as close friends on . their high school team (Clint is No. 11 top right). Rivera  was training to be policeman when he  accidentally shot himself in the head ¿ his gun going off as he picked up an ear plug from the floor . 'He was training, training, training. He was always challenging himself. He was always taking risks. II took him to London in his first year and we got tickets to see Fulham play Liverpool. 'Five years later he was playing in the same game and I watched as he scored the winner that kept Fulham in the Premier League. 'It was an amazing moment.' Along the way he became a permanent member of the US team, making his World Cup debut in 2006. But in the eyes of the American public he always played second fiddle to Donovan until now. Despite his towering ambition he has always kept his feet firmly on the ground and put his family first. When he won the Honda Player of the Year in 2006, he donated the truck to his father. And when his sister Crystal’s wedding took place just before a crucial match for the USA in 2011, he told the coach he was going “regardless” of the consequences. In the end, he flew back, the night before the match day and took part in the game. Now that Donovan has been left out of the squad, Dempsey, wearing the captain’s armband, has come to the fore. 'I don’t think he actually realizes what he has achieved,' said Allison. 'This is his time. He is one of the greatest players the US has ever had. It has been a truly amazing journey that he has undertaken.'","Team USA captain Clint Dempsey scored just 29 seconds after kick off and went on to beat long-time rival Ghana .
When he scores he raises his fingers to the sky in tribute to his sister Jennifer who died of a brain aneurism and best friend who accidently shot himself in the head .

"Allan Staughton put his then girlfriend's cat into a tumble dryer . A cruel yob is facing jail after shutting his girlfriend's terrified cat in a tumble dryer and put it through three spin cycles because he thought it was funny. Heartless Allan Staughton, 23, put the pet in the machine for 12 seconds and even filmed the animal's ordeal then posted a video of his vicious prank online. During the video he can be heard joking the cat, called Princess, was 'the new Mr Tumble' and asked viewers to rate the disturbing YouTube video on a forum. The RSPCA were alerted to the online . video entitled 'You must see this - it will crack you up' and launched a . man hunt for Staughton, who posted the sickening film under the alias . Nitroazza. They discovered Princess suffered a broken tooth and a tongue injury in the terrifying attack and has now been rehomed. Sick Staughton is now facing up to six months in jail after admitting animal cruelty at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court. The lout broke down in tears during the hearing on Tuesday after his internet anonymity was unmasked in the court. Magistrates . heard Staughton had been dumped by his lover of four-and-a-half years . and thrown out of their home following the cruel stunt. Robert Starr, prosecuting for the RSPCA, asked the bench to order a life-time ban on him keeping pets. Staughton laughed as the cat, called Princess, was shoved in the tumble dryer and injured in the terrifying ordeal . Staughton trapped his girlfriend's terrified cat in the tumble dryer and put it through three spin cycles, because he thought it was funny . Princess suffered a broken tooth and a tongue injury in the ordeal and has now been rehomed . Sick Staughton admitted animal cruelty at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court . He said: 'The cat would have been very terrified and would have suffered mental and physical effects caused by the cat having no method of escape. 'The reason why Princess didn't move when the door was opened is because the incident would have left the cat in sheer terror, unbalanced and disorientated. 'It left the cat without any of its senses that you would attribute to a cat. 'This would have been compounded by the fact that it had no means of escape.' Mr Starr said a vet examined the cat on July 6 and said it would have been disoriented and traumatised by its experience. The prosecutor added that when Staughton was interviewed he had thought the incident was 'funny.' He added: 'He accepted it was a disgusting thing to do.' Klare Kennett, spokeswoman for RSPCA Cambridgeshire, yesterday said: 'This is a horrible thing to do to a cat. 'The animal will have suffered great trauma and a great deal of panic in that situation. It is totally unacceptable.' The RSPCA were alerted to the online video entitled 'You must see this - it will crack you up' and launched a man hunt for Staughton . After the incident Staughton's relationship broke down with the mother of his child and the owner of Princess . Magistrates were shown the film of the cat, which has been removed from YouTube, being put into the machine as Staughton said it was going for 'a tumble'. The dryer was then turned on with the cat spinning inside for 12 seconds before Staughton opened the door. Even after the cat was on its back in the bottom of the machine with its legs in the door and meowing Staughton spun it twice more. The RSPCA tracked down Staughton outside a pub in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, following the incident on June 14. The court heard Princess the cat had belonged to Staughton's former partner of four-and -a-half-years who he has a two-and-a-half-year-old child with. Magistrates were told Staughton's relationship had broken down over the incident and he had moved out. Princess was taken to Wood Green Animal Shelter, in Godmanchester, where she was later re-homed. Staughton, of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the cat and sentence was adjourned for reports. Kevin Warboys, mitigating, asked for reports on Staughton who suffered ADHD and a conduct disorder. He said: 'Mr Staughton suffers from conduct disorder which he says means 'I just do things without thinking.' 'The idea arose from the cat often getting into the tumble dryer after it has been used, which my client believes is because it is warm. 'This case has had a devastating effect on him and he awaits with trepidation the sentencing of the court.' Staughton will be sentenced on November 13. He could be jailed for up to six months and fined up to £20,000 for animal cruelty under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.","Allan Staughton trapped a cat in the tumble dryer for 12 seconds .

"Killed: Sandor Horvath, 65, was chased and pulled off the scooter at a farm in Magyarszecsod . A Hungarian pensioner was dragged off his mobility scooter and mauled to death by a pair of killer donkeys. Sandor Horvath, 65, was bitten and trampled on so much that when his body was found it was believed had been torn apart by wolves. Mr Horvath, was chased and pulled off the scooter at a farm in Magyarszecsod where he was visiting his farmer friend. His mutilated remains were found by the farm owner who called the police, believing his friend had been attacked by wild dogs. But a postmortem revealed the bites and markings had come from the donkeys. Police who pieced together the evidence said it appeared that the donkeys had chased the man and dragged him off the scooter before killing him. The farmer’s daughter Csikos Darda said: 'I had noticed that the donkeys were becoming increasingly aggressive and I’d asked my father to do something about it, but he’d said they were fine.' A vet told local media: 'Donkeys aren't usually aggressive towards humans. 'They probably reacted like this as they thought the victim was intruding upon their territory.'

"A joke at the expense of the mentally ill, however it was intended, is probably not the most politically correct thing for a police officer to post on Twitter. The non-PC PC’s tweet included a photograph of an officer, said to be PC Nick Boyce, with ice cream splattered on his uniform. With the picture was the comment: ‘Warning do not get  to [sic] close to people with  mental health problems when they are eating ice cream.’ Offensive: The tweet which appeared to poke fun at mentally ill was sent out from an account run by he police liaison officers with Bristol University on Bank Holiday Monday . One said: ‘Wow, this is ill-judged at the very least! I can’t get over it. I’m quite angry in fact.’ Another commented: ‘That’s absolutely abhorrent. I’d do more than smash an ice cream into the tw*t’s chest.’ Another reacted: ‘I’m actually appalled. the more I read it, the more I can’t believe how ignorant they can be!’ And Phil Verney said: ‘Yeah, and of course Churchill, Stephen Fry are known for throwing ice cream at people.’ Yesterday Avon and Somerset Police would not confirm what had actually happened ahead of the officer been covered in ice cream and whether or not he had actually engaged with someone suffering from mental health issues. Appalling: Avon and Somerset police's chief constable apologised for the offensive tweet of PC Nick Boyce (pictured) But Chief Constable Nick Gargan responded to the original tweet posted on @BristolUniCops, saying: ‘It was very unwise indeed and will be deleted and apologised for as soon as the account holder responds to my [direct message].’ He added of the incident: ‘Removal, contrition & education are precisely right. ‘Just had a call from the Control room: we’re on it.” The @BristolUniCops account is run by Pc Nick Boyce & PCSO Dudley Rowe who are the police liaison officers with Bristol University. A tweet on the page later said: “Sorry everyone for that regrettable tweet earlier. ‘I take @MentalHealthCop advice. We’ve now had removal. Contrition & education next.’ Pc Boyce is a serving officer with over 25 years’ experience and a former merchant navy sailor. Yesterday other Twitter users urged Mr Gargan to punish the officer responsible. One said: ‘Wow @ngargan_police you really need to have a word with @BristolUniCops about their attitudes towards mental health. Very ill judged tweet.’ Saying sorry: The Twitter profile of Bristol University police liason officers PC Nick Boyce and PCSO Dudley Rowe later had several apologetic tweets posted . The tweet was yesterday removed from Twitter. The message on the @BristolUniCops page said: ‘Apologies this was not mean to offend sorry if it did it wasn’t meant too [sic].’ Yesterday a second added: ‘Dear all, I now realise that my tweet of yesterday was totally inappropriate. I apologies again if it caused any offence.’ Last month another officer from Avon and Somerset Police was sacked for a Twitter account criticising his force and comparing bosses to ‘slime’. Tony Ryan, 33, sent more than 800 tweets from @TheBritishCop - including labelling his officials ‘’scum’’. He always denied the Twitter site was his - but his seniors matched his tweets with his duties and ruled it must have been his. He was dismissed for gross misconduct after a disciplinary panel decided on the ‘balance of probability’ he was the anonymous officer. Investigators could not directly attribute the posts to him but decided they matched his ‘intimate knowledge’.","Tweet sent out by police liaison officers with Bristol University .

"'Mince flies' (pictured) contain mealworm beetle larvae and locusts as well as traditional ingredients . Dinner guests may raise their eyebrows – and run a mile – if you serve them mince pies made from locusts and beetle larvae this holiday season. But 'mince flies' are a more sustainable, protein-rich and healthy alternative to conventional recipes, according to their makers. The delicacies will be handed out at London’s famous foodie market in Borough to raise awareness of sustainable food. They are designed to inspire people to consider the environmental impact of the food they eat, especially at Christmas time. At a time of the year that sees most of us overindulge, the Big Bang UK Young Scientists & Engineers Fair challenged food scientist and TV personality Stefan Gates to rethink traditional Christmas treats and create a more sustainable seasonal snack. The result is ‘mince flies,’ which are made from mealworm beetle larvae and locusts, mixed with traditional dried fruit and spices to make them more palatable. ‘One of the simplest ways of tackling the sustainability of our food supply is by exploring alternative sources of protein,’ Mr Gates said. ‘If we want to be able to feed a growing population, even at Christmas people need to be open to new food adventures and look beyond traditional favourites such as turkey, goose or gammon. Scroll down for recipe . The ‘mince flies’ (pictured) are designed to inspire people to consider the environmental impact of the food we eat, especially at Christmas time . ‘With nearly 2,000 known edible insect species to try, supplementing our diet with insects is one solution to combat rising food prices and the environmental impacts of traditional livestock farming. 'Trust me, these “Mince Flies” really are delicious and we hope they will get people thinking about what their traditional Christmas dinner might look like in the future’. With the global population set to pass nine billion in 2050, scientists predict that the world’s agricultural output needs to increase by 70 per cent to feed everyone. Traditional meat production causes multiple sustainability issues, including large greenhouse gas emissions, while insects on the other hand, are very efficient consumers of resources. The crunchy locust on top of the bronzed pastry made for unconventional presentation, but the filling was spicy and moist - if a little slimy . The crunchy locust on top of the bronzed pastry made for unconventional presentation. I bit into the locust with trepidation. It gave way with a crunch and its wings had a papery, but not unpleasant texture. I couldn't quite bring myself to eat its heads because of its staring eyes. Inside, the filling was moist and tasted just like a traditional, spicy mince pie - with added crunch and a nutty aftertaste courtesy of the worms. Despite my fears, it tasted good. The crispy mealworms on top of the pastry tasted neutral but also nutty with a crispy texture, while those inside were plump and a touch slimy much like the  the sultanas, which were chewy. Despite liking the taste, seeing the slimy worms inside the pie diminished my culinary enjoyment. Without the decoration on top of the festive treat, the pie could fool the most informed of foodies into thinking it was a normal rich and flavoursome mince pie - which was surprisingly filling thanks to its high protein content. I'd eat another one - without looking inside. ‘One of the simplest ways of tackling the sustainability of our food supply is by exploring alternative sources of protein,’ food scientist and TV personality Stefan Gates said. Locusts and mealworms (shown on the pies) contain as much protein as beef, with around half the calories . One third of the global population, or two billion people, already eat insects as a regular part of their diet. Thailand, for example already has 20,000 small scale insect farms rearing over 7,500 tonnes of grasshoppers, crickets and other edible insects a year. Insects are nutritious because they are high in essential fatty acids, calcium, zinc, iron and B12. Gram for gram crickets have comparable levels of protein compared to beef half the calories and about 60 per cent less fat. Children from the Harris Academy Greenwich and Graveney School in Tooting, south east London, have tried the ‘mince flies’ and are dishing them out to Londoners at Borough Market. Jarvis, a year seven pupil from the Graveney School, said: ‘At first I was nervous about trying something new, but the mince flies tasted fantastic.’ Paul Jackson, Chief Executive of EngineeringUK said: 'The Big Bang UK Young Scientists & Engineers Fair is passionate about showing young people the exciting and rewarding opportunities there are for them in careers in the sciences and engineering. We hope that our “Mince Flies” will excite children to consider new ways of thinking to develop solutions to the way we live our lives in the future.’ Stefan Gates will be performing his ‘Supertasters’ show at The Big Bang Fair at the NEC, Birmingham from 11-14 March 2015. The crispy mealworms on top of the pastry tasted neutral but nutty with a crispy texture, while those inside were plump and a touch slimy much like the the sultanas, which were chewy . Decoration for the pies include buffalo worms and a dried locust (pictured) Pastry: 125g plain flour, a pinch of salt, 55g butter cut into cubes and 2-3tbsp of cold water . Filling: Nine tbsp of mincemeat,  eight tbsp of dried buffalo worms and one egg . Decoration: Extra buffalo worms and a dried locust for each pie . Method: . 1. Put the flour, salt and butter in a food mixer or processor (you can easily do it with your hands, too), then mix or pulse (or rub together if hand-making) to the consistency of breadcrumbs. 2. Add the cold water a splash at a time on a slow speed until the dough comes together, then wrap in cling-film and chill in the fridge for 15 mins before use. 3. Mix the mincemeat with the worms. Cut out circles of pastry large enough to sit in the hollows of a metal cake tray, then fill each with a heaped tablespoon of mincemeat, leaving 1cm of clear pastry around each edge . 4. Paint around this rim with the egg mixture, then add a pastry lid made from a slightly smaller pastry cutter and press around the edges to stick them together. 5. For decoration, make a slit in the top of each pie, then press a dried locust into it. Paint around it with more of the egg mixture and sprinkle the remaining worms on top. 6. Bake in the middle of a hot oven at 175C (fan)/200C (conventional oven)/gas mark 6 for about 20 minutes then cool on a wire rack.

"The number of chickens contaminated with a potentially lethal food poisoning bug could be far higher than originally feared, sources have claimed. A study published earlier this year by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) found that six in ten roasting birds were carrying the bug campylobacter. But industry sources believe that research due to be released today will show that levels were even worse in chickens purchased over the summer. One told the industry website FoodManufacture.co.uk that as many as nine in ten chickens in some samples tested positive for the bug. Campylobacter is associated with 280,000 food poisoning cases a year and as many as 100 deaths, making it Britain's biggest food poisoning threawt . Ministers, supermarkets and producers have known about the problem of campylobacter for more than a decade, but promises to reduce its levels in chicken have so far failed to deliver any improvement. The bug is associated with 280,000 food poisoning cases a year and as many as 100 deaths, making it Britain’s biggest food poisoning threat. The survey results published today will for the first time list contamination levels in chicken sold by Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, the Co-op, Waitrose and Marks & Spencer. Andrew Large, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said there are good reasons to believe that the latest study will reveal a rise in the number of contaminated birds. This is because the results will include chickens which were reared in large barns over the summer months when any infections or bugs in the flocks are likely to spread more rapidly. He said: ‘It would be fair to say that campylobacter has a seasonal effect. There is a historical trend of it peaking in the summer. There is no reason to believe this latest survey won’t reflect that trend.’ But Mr Large defended the industry’s failure to deliver a reduction in rates, saying producers have struggled to identify how the bug is being introduced to flocks. While it is found in the wider environment and countryside, most of the 800million chickens raised for food in the UK each year spend their entire lives inside. Producers have struggled to identify how the bug is introduced to flocks. While it is found in the  countryside, most of the 800million chickens raised for food in the UK each year spend their entire lives inside . Supermarkets and their trade body the British Retail Consortium (BRC) have been involved in a fierce lobbying campaign designed to prevent stores selling so-called ‘dirty chicken’ being named. It is believed that they asked the ministers in food and farming department DEFRA and the Prime Minister to keep today’s survey results secret. Initially, these attempts appeared to be successful – however the FSA decided to go public after the Daily Mail lifted the lid on the attempted cover-up this summer. Research published today by consumer group Which? has revealed that 55 per cent of shoppers think they have been kept in the dark about the problem. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘Our research clearly shows that the majority of people are concerned about high levels of this potentially deadly bug in their supermarket chicken. ‘By releasing information about which supermarkets are most affected, the FSA will at once put more public pressure on the poor performers to improve and give consumers better information about campylobacter levels.’ The BRC pointed out that some stores are helping by introducing ‘roast in the bag’ packs so people do not have to touch the raw chicken at all. However a spokesman for the trade body attempted to shift responsibility for tackling campylobacter to shoppers, saying they should protect themselves by handling chicken carefully and cooking it thoroughly. They added: ‘At the moment the only way to be sure it is safe to eat is by cooking it properly and observing good kitchen hygiene.’","Many birds sold for roasting found to be contaminated with campylobacter .

"Flash-fest: Parents give presents worth thousands of pounds as parents try to curry favour with the school . It sounds like a lottery winner’s wishlist – vintage wine, diamond necklaces and flights on a private jet. But these luxuries are in fact being enjoyed by teachers, thanks to an ‘aggressive and manipulative’ gift culture among parents at private schools. Families who believe they can curry favour with staff are showering them with £1,000 handbags and Savile Row suits as well as thousands of pounds in vouchers. Teachers are also being given cases of vintage wine and designer goods from Chanel, Prada, Mulberry and Tiffany as part of a ‘cut-throat flash-fest’. At one school teachers were reportedly offered the use of a family’s private jet. Tatler magazine said it had received ‘extensive first-hand accounts’ from readers that ‘some schools are accepting inappropriately extravagant gifts’ from parents. It has questioned whether a Hermes handbag or a diamond necklace should be considered as an acceptable end-of-term present or ‘simply bribery’. And it points out that such gifts could see a school fall foul of the Bribery Act 2010. Tatler has now launched a campaign, urging families to put pressure on their children’s private schools to clamp down on competitive gift giving, which is getting increasingly out of hand. An investigation found that some families viewed lavish presents as ‘just another way to get ahead’. Some even arrive at parents’ evenings with ‘bottles of champagne and trays of cupcakes’. The publication has contacted the heads . of all schools in the Tatler Schools Guide, requesting their policy on . presents and plans to publish responses on its website today. Lavish: Teachers have been given diamond necklaces and private jet rides as an end-of-term gift from parents . And it has urged parents to take a stand against those that ‘consider extravagant gifting an acceptable practice’. A report in the magazine’s June edition, entitled Classroom Corruption?, highlights how a £1,000 handbag is now considered an ‘acceptable token of thanks’ for teachers at some private schools. Chanel handbags, Savile Row suits, iPads, keys to the family villa and use of the family jet were among presents reported to Tatler. And the report warns that the trend shows no signs of abating. One headmaster of a prep school said he returns gifts once a fortnight on average. ‘It’s all year round: theatre tickets, hampers, silk ties, handkerchiefs, even gold cufflinks pinpricked with diamonds,’ he said. One mother said she was ‘miraculously’ offered a place at a full prep school with a large waiting list after . giving the headmistress of her child’s nursery a holiday for Christmas. A mother at an all-girls London prep was told that if she contributed less than £90 to the class festive gifts, another parent would ‘feel uncomfortable’ about signing the same Christmas card. ‘Needless to say, I had far less to give, but I was stung and humiliated into opening my wallet and forking out more than I would spend on a single member of my own family,’ she said. Teachers described feeling embarrassed by the lavish gestures, with some selling presents on eBay or giving them away as presents. Janette Wallis, of The Good Schools Guide, said that parents often feel ‘exceptional gratitude’ to teaching staff. Kate Reardon, editor of Tatler, yesterday appealed to parents and schools to take a stand. She said: ‘The charming tradition of giving your teacher a leaving card or gift, possibly something homemade, is one we’ve all grown up with. ‘But we have heard from worried parents and schools that in some cases the gifting culture is becoming increasingly aggressive and manipulative.’ Some schools have clamped down – Notting Hill prep in West London imposes a £40 cap on staff presents over the year and Stowe introduced a gift register and a cupboard for anything exceeding £50. Rugby and Harrow also guard against ‘overzealous gifters’.","Gifts include Savile Row suits, thousand-pound vouchers, private jet use .

"Writer Simon Kernick was taken ill with stomach pains which resulted in his appendix 'exploding' Thriller . writer Simon Kernick prided himself on being fit and healthy, so when . he developed stomach ache after eating cherries earlier this summer, he . assumed he'd just over-indulged. Yet rather than getting any better, over the next day the pain intensified. 'It . was all over my stomach,' recalls Simon, 48, a divorced father-of-two . from Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. 'I do a lot of Thai cookery so I . thought the king prawns I'd had earlier that day might be to blame. Google just scared me as it suggested bowel cancer, Crohn's disease, . irritable bowel syndrome or appendicitis. 'I ruled out appendicitis . as my brother Nick had appendicitis when he was six, and I knew his scar . was low down on the right side of his stomach. My pain was from under . my ribcage to below my navel.' In fact, he did have appendicitis - . and within five days of the first symptoms,  his appendix had burst and . he was undergoing emergency surgery. But in the meantime, oblivious . to this, he took some paracetamol. That night he slept fitfully and the . next day, he went to his GP. She felt the lower right part of his . abdomen to check for appendicitis. Yet because Simon didn't feel any . discomfort there, she concluded he had a stomach virus and prescribed . painkillers. Although the pain had gone by the next day, Simon still . felt unwell. 'I'd no energy at all, but assumed my strength was going . into fighting my stomach bug. I can walk 25 miles - I enjoy the odd long . trek - but that day I couldn't walk 25 yards,' he says. By day five, . the pain had returned, this time on the right side of his abdomen, and . was so intense Simon was  bent double. 'I couldn't sleep on my right . side, and when I got up that morning, I was on my knees in unbearable . pain. I rang my dad, John, who lives nearby, to take me to the hospital . seven miles away. Just getting into his car had me screaming in pain. When we arrived at the hospital I staggered in, holding on to the wall . for support.' An immediate scan revealed the cause of Simon's pain. 'One side of my appendix had literally been blown away because of the . extent of the infection,' he says. 'A doctor said my insides were like a . war zone. My appendix was behind my large bowel, which is why I didn't . feel any tenderness when my GP examined me initially.' Appendicitis . is common - around 7 per cent of people will experience it, typically . between the ages of ten to 20, although why it should be more common at . this age is not clear. But older people can develop it, too. The . appendix - a narrow, finger-like pouch between 5cm and 10cm long - is . attached to the beginning of the large intestine on the right side of . the abdomen. But because of its length, the tip can lie in different . positions, in the pelvis, in front of the bowel or, as Simon's was, . behind the bowel. He underwent keyhole surgery to remove the infection . So although people often think severe stomach ache . can only be appendicitis if it's on the right side of the abdomen, most . patients, like Simon, find the pain starts in the centre. And some . people won't have stomach ache at all. 'A young child with . appendicitis may have no pain, but might have a fever or be short of . breath and looking poorly,' explains Neil Pearce, a general surgery . consultant at Southampton General Hospital.Children under five are . often much more difficult to diagnose because of their limited . communication skills, adds Colin Elton, a colorectal and laparoscopic . surgeon at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and Spire Bushey . Hospital in Watford, Hertfordshire. 'A lot of appendicitis cases in . children are misdiagnosed as gastroenteritis or a virus,' says Mr Elton. 'Adults with appendicitis may have one or more other  symptoms, such as . nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhoea and a high temperature. 'As . symptoms can vary it can easily be confused with other conditions. In . up to 30 per cent of cases involving women, the diagnosis is wrong and a . normal appendix may be removed, when in fact the pain has been caused . by ovarian cysts, a pelvic infection or a urine infection.' Appendicitis . begins as a result of a blockage at its entrance most commonly caused . by a hard piece of stool (a faecolith), which can be between 5mm and . 10mm. With children or adolescents, it can occur a week or so after a . viral infection. As Mr Elton explains: 'This is because the appendix . is a lymphoid organ - a structure that drains infection from other . parts of the body. The lymph follicles in the appendix can swell up so . much during a virus infection that they block it.' Once the appendix . is blocked, bacteria inside it start multiplying and it becomes . inflamed. As well as pain this can lead to the other symptoms, including . diarrhoea and a high temperature. The best treatment for . appendicitis is to remove the appendix, suggests Mr Elton. 'Sometimes . people are given antibiotics if their pain settles down, but 20 per cent . of these will have a recurrence of the symptoms.' An appendicectomy - . removal of the appendix - is the most common emergency abdominal . surgery in the UK. Most are carried out by keyhole surgery. Yet if . diagnosis is delayed, the appendix can continue to swell, and in a fifth . of cases goes on to burst, releasing bacteria, which can spread to the . peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the . abdomen, causing inflammation, or peritonitis. This is potentially . fatal, as the infection can then spread to major organs, causing organ . failure. 'We never know how long we have from the start of . appendicitis to the appendix bursting - in some cases the pressure . builds up quickly, within a few hours, but in other cases a patient can . have appendicitis for several days,' explains Mr Elton. The problem is that if there is  no pain or if it comes and goes, diagnosis can be delayed. 'The . pain might settle down  and the patient will think they're getting . better,' says Mr Elton, 'but what's happening is the omentum, a large . apron of fat that acts as the guardian of the abdomen, wraps itself . around the appendix as the body tries to protect itself from infection.' They used about six litres of fluid to wash all the infection away . Appendicitis . can be diagnosed with blood tests. 'The white cell count may increase . with infection,' says Mr Elton. 'We can also use an ultrasound . examination or a CT scan to look at the appendix.' The diagnosis is . usually confirmed in hospital as GPs surgeries, adds Mr Elton, 'don't . have all the equipment in their surgeries that we have in hospital. We . usually have a diagnosis within 24 hours in hospital'. A laparoscopy - . where a tiny camera is inserted through a small incision near the navel . to get a look at the appendix - can be carried out under general . anaesthetic. If appendicitis is confirmed, an appendicectomy is carried . out at the same time. Simon Kernick's burst appendix was picked up . just in time. He underwent three-and-a-half hours of keyhole surgery . after arriving at A&E. 'When I came round they said they'd used . about six litres of fluid to wash all the infection away,' he says. His . mother, Pauline, father, and daughters, Amy, 15, and, Rachel, 11, were . waiting for him on his ward. 'My mum used to be a nurse and after I was . discharged from hospital she told me the first death she'd dealt with . was caused by a burst appendix - it had worried her while I was in . hospital.' But even after his surgery, Simon was not out of the woods . - two days later, while he was still in hospital, his temperature . started to climb. A scan revealed he'd developed an abscess in his . pelvis. These are more common in people who have had a burst appendix . and can appear up to five days after surgery, says Mr Elton, and . patients who've already been discharged can find themselves being . readmitted urgently for this reason. Symptoms include stomach pain, . flu-like symptoms and diarrhoea. A pelvic abscess is usually drained . by radiologists guided by ultrasound. Simon stayed in hospital for six . days, and left with antibiotics. He had lost five kilos (nearly 8lb) in . that time. However, seven weeks on, his appetite has returned and he . is as active as ever. 'I am running again, weight lifting and my . stamina feels as good as ever it was,' he says. 'I don't blame my GP for not diagnosing appendicitis. The experience has made me realise how lucky I am.'
