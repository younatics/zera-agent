"(CNN) -- Paris Hilton continued to do damage control Thursday, apologizing for saying gay men were ""disgusting"" and ""probably had AIDS."" ""I am so sorry and so upset that I caused pain to my gay friends, fans and their families,"" Hilton said in part of a lengthy apology she released to the the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD.) ""Gay people are the strongest and most inspiring people I know."" Hilton's apology comes the same day an audio recording of her speaking about gay people appeared on the Internet. The audio was recorded as Hilton was riding in a cab with ""an openly gay male model"" during New York Fashion Week in the early morning hours of Friday, September 7, RadarOnline reported. The gay friend was showing Hilton the iPhone app Grindr, which advertises itself as the ""most popular all-male location-based social network out there,"" offering ""quick, convenient, and discreet"" connections, RadarOnline reported. ""Say I log into Grindr, someone that's on Grindr can be in that building and it tells you all the locations of where they are and you can be like, 'Yo, you wanna f--k?' and he might be on like, the sixth floor,"" the male voice is heard saying. ""Ewww! Gay guys are the horniest people in the world,"" Hilton said. ""They're disgusting. Dude, most of them probably have AIDS. ... I would be so scared if I were a gay guy. You'll like, die of AIDS."" Shortly after the tape was posted Hilton's publicist said her comments were expressions of concern about the dangers of unprotected sex, not homophobic slurs. Hilton's publicist, in a statement sent to CNN Thursday, confirmed the recording was authentic, but said, ""It was not her intent to make any derogatory comments about all gays."" ""Paris Hilton is a huge supporter of the gay community and would never purposefully make any negative statements about anyone's sexual orientation,"" the statement said.

"(CNN) -- Late goals from Fernando Torres and Branislav Ivanovic gave European champions Chelsea a 4-2 win over promoted Reading at Stamford Bridge Wednesday. The hard-fought victory put Chelsea top of the early standings in the English Premier League with two wins from two games. But they were made to work hard by the battling visitors, who led 2-1 deep into the second half after Frank Lampard had put the home side ahead with an 18th-minute penalty. Chelsea's new signing Eden Hazard was again influential, winning a penalty after being pulled down by defender Chris Gunter. Veteran midfielder Lampard easily beat Adam Federici and last season's Champions League winners looked set for a comfortable victory. Are footballers on a par with bankers? But in a dramatic turnaround, Russia international Pavel Pogrebnyak -- who played for Fulham in the Premier League last season -- leveled with a firm header from a Garath McCleary cross before the visitors went ahead as Danny Guthrie's free kick found its way past Petr Cech. It was a soft goal to concede by the home goalkeeper, but midway through the second half Chelsea were level after an even worse blunder by Federici. He allowed a speculative long-range effort from defender Gary Cahill to go under his body, similar to his mistake in the 1-1 draw with Stoke in Reading's EPL opener on Saturday. Chelsea pushed forward in search of a winner, but there was an element of fortune when Torres struck from close range as replays appeared to indicate the Euro 2012 winner was offside as he received a pass from England defender Ashley Cole in the 81st minute. Federici's miserable evening was complete when the Australian came up for a corner in injury time, but it was cleared quickly and Torres then Hazard set up Ivanovic for the clinching fourth goal. The three points put Roberto Di Matteo's men top of the EPL table for the first time since November 2010 after a fixture brought forward due to Chelsea's involvement in the UEFA Super Cup, where they will play Spain's Europa League winners Atletico Madrid in Monaco on Friday. Meanwhile, troubled Spanish club Malaga took a step nearer their first appearance in the Champions League group stage with a 2-0 win over Panathinaikos of Greece in the first leg of their final qualifier. Malaga saw several top players depart in the close season but Jesualdo Ferreira's men were too good for their Greek visitors with first-half goals from Argentine defender Martin Demichelis and Portuguese winger Eliseu. Cypriot side AEL Limassol will take a 2-1 lead over Anderlecht of Belgium into the second leg, while Croatia's Dinamo Zagreb lead Maribor of Slovenia by the same score. Belarus side BATE Borisov were 2-0 winners against Hapoel Kiryat Shmona of Israel, while a superb goal from Ismaily earned a 1-1 home draw for Portugal's Braga against Italian visitors Udinese, who had led through Dusan Basta.","Chelsea beat Reading 4-2 at Stamford Bridge to go top of EPL .

"(CNN) -- The drama surrounding Olympus and cover-up of $1.7 billion in losses resulted in the first arrests Thursday. Three former executives -- ex-Chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, former Executive Vice President Hisashi Mori, and Hideo Yamada, a former auditor -- were arrested for filing fraudulent information on the company accounts in 2007 and 2008. Four other outside financial advisers were also arrested for assisting with the fraud. The furor that followed the firing of former Olympus CEO Michael Woodford in October and his subsequent turn as whistleblower on the decades-long cover-up, saw the stock value of the Japanese camera and medical instruments maker drop more than 75% at the height of the crisis. Besides the charges in Japan, officials in the U.S. and the UK are investigating possible criminal wrongdoing. The company appointed an independent commission, led by a former Japanese supreme court judge, who released a report in December saying, ""the management was rotten to the core, and infected those around it."" Who is Michael Woodford? A foreign ""salariman"" for Olympus, the Briton worked for 30 years at the company, starting as a sales assistant in its medical sales division and rising up the ranks to become executive managing director of its European operations in 2008. In April, he was tapped by outgoing President and CEO Kikukawa to become the Japanese company's first foreign president, a rarity among Japanese listed companies. Only Howard Stringer, Chairman of Sony, Carlos Ghosn, the head of Nissan, and Craig Naylor of Nippon Sheet Glass currently lead Japanese listed companies. According to Woodford, things began to go awry internally when a Japanese magazine, FACTA, published an expose in July questioning exorbitant fees Olympus paid consultants for a 2008 acquisition deal, and extravagant purchase prices of three small companies. Woodford said that when he began asking Kikukawa and Mori about the deal, he was stonewalled. Tensions escalated until October 14 when at a board meeting Woodford was fired by a unanimous vote. What was the cover-up? According to a December 6 report issued by the third party set up by the company to investigate Woodford's claims, the company had inflated fees for the 2008 purchase of Gyrus, a UK medical instruments firm. The fees paid to advisers totaled $687 million, nearly one-third of the company's purchase price. The panel also found the $773 million paid for three small Japanese companies -- a face cream maker, a plastic container maker and a recycling business, each with fewer than 50 employees -- were exorbitantly priced to cover-up the company's loses. The problems at Olympus date back to Japan's booming 1980s, according to the report. After the 1985 Plaza Accord on currency, Japan's yen steeply appreciate in value. To offset the losses Japanese corporations saw on the back of a rising yen, companies like Olympus began dealing highly speculative securities, such as derivatives trading, the report said. By 1990, the losses had mounted and a series of chief executives, ending with Kikukawa, kept the losses secret. The losses were hidden through an intricate scheme that diverted cash through a Cayman Islands account. Police in several countries are still investigating the transaction -- so far, no one has been arrested in the scheme. Was the Japanese mafia involved? There have been some published reports that the Japanese mafia may have been involved in helping to hide the assets. While criminal investigators may still examine that possibility, the independent committee report said it did not find any involvement of ""antisocial forces"" in its investigations. What's next? After his ouster, Woodford talked to investigators in three continents, Japanese legislators about improving corporate governance in the company, and campaigned to retake the helm of the company. Woodford sought the resignation of the entire Olympus board and new management for the company. The Olympus board said it plans to step down, but not until after a special shareholder meeting expected in April to chart the new management direction of the company. In January, citing lack of support from Japanese institutional investors, Woodford abandoned his drive to return to the company, but said he plans to file suit for wrongful termination.","NEW: Seven men arrested in connection with $1.7 billion Olympus Corp fraud .

"London (CNN) -- The Ecuadorian president said the United Kingdom would be ""suicidal"" to come into Ecuador's embassy in London, where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been holed up since June. ""I think it would be suicidal for Great Britain to enter Ecuador's embassy. Later on, they could have their own embassies violated in all corners of the globe, and they'd have nothing to say about it,"" President Rafael Correa told state TV. Assange fled to the Ecuadorian embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over sex crime allegations. The dispute between Britain and Ecuador exploded when the British Foreign Office, in a letter to Ecuadorian officials, cited a little known law that could temporarily suspend the embassy's diplomatic protection and allow authorities to enter and arrest Assange. Ecuador's Correa defends Assange asylum decision . Correa has slammed Britain's behavior toward Ecuador, describing it as ""intolerable"" and ""unacceptable."" ""Who do they think they're dealing with?"" Correa said during his weekly address Saturday. ""They don't realize Latin America is free and sovereign. We won't tolerate interference, colonialism of any kind."" Last week, Ecuador officially offered Assange asylum in the South American country, but the British say they will not give him safe passage out of the embassy. The Foreign Office says Britain has a legal obligation to hand him over to Sweden, after Assange's legal efforts to avoid extradition were rejected by British courts up to the Supreme Court. Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, said his client was willing to answer Swedish prosecutors' questions, but only if he is given certain guarantees. Assange, an Australian, and his supporters claim a U.S. grand jury has been empaneled to consider charges against him. Assange claims to fear Sweden will transfer him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty for the work of WikiLeaks. Sweden angrily rejected the allegation last week. ""Sweden does not extradite individuals who risk facing the death penalty,"" the Foreign Ministry said. On Sunday, Assange demanded the United States drop its ""witch hunt"" against WikiLeaks when he made his first public appearance in months. ""As WikiLeaks stands under threat, so does the freedom of expression and the health of all our societies,"" the founder of website said to cheers from supporters outside the Ecuadorian embassy. ""The U.S. war on whistle-blowers must end,"" he said, calling for the freedom of Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier suspected of giving hundreds of thousands of pages of secret American government documents to Assange for publication on WikiLeaks. Assange has been effectively confined for the past two months to the diplomatic mission -- a suite of rooms covering half of one floor of a townhouse in a posh London neighborhood south of Hyde Park. Two years ago, Swedish prosecutors first issued a warrant for his arrest over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. Assange and diplomatic asylum: A primer . Assange said the allegations in Sweden are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website, which facilitates the publication of secret documents. He has published hundreds of thousands of pages of American government diplomatic cables and assessments of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Correa has sought support on the issue from foreign ministers of the the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and the leftist Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA), who gathered in Guayaquil, Ecuador, over the weekend. UNASUR backed Ecuador's decision to grant Assange asylum and called for more dialogue between Britain and Ecuador on the issue. It condemned the ""threat of the use of force"" and expressed its hope that the countries could arrive at a ""mutually acceptable solution."" ALBA, whose membership includes Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, warned Britain on Saturday against raiding the embassy. ""We warn the government of the United Kingdom that it will face grave consequences around the world if it directly breaches the territorial integrity of the Embassy of the Republic of Ecuador in London,"" according to a statement read by Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro on behalf of ALBA nations.

"(CNN) -- Japanese prosecutors arrested seven men, including former Olympus Corp. Chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, for their alleged involvement in a massive $1.7 billion accounting fraud at the Japanese camera and medical equipment maker. Other former executives arrested Thursday include ex-Executive Vice President Hisashi Mori and former Auditor Hideo Yamada, according to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office. Four others arrested were financial advisers who allegedly assisted Olympus executives in the coverup. ""We are deeply concerned about the seriousness of this situation,"" the Olympus Corp said in a statement. ""In order to find the full facts, we will continue to fully cooperate with law enforcement authorities in the investigation."" Allegations at Olympus came to light after the October dismissal of former President Michael Woodford who was fired when he questioned Kikukawa, Mori and Yamada about dubious transactions at the center of the case. A special audit of Olympus in December, led by a former Japanese Supreme Court judge, detailed $1.7 billion of hidden losses from failed investments in the 1990s by the company. The report blasted the culture of the company that allowed the losses to be disguised in dubious fees and overvalued payments for companies, as well as the tight control of Kikukawa. ""The management was rotten to the core, and infected those around it,"" the panel's report said. The scandal has been an embarrassment to Japan Inc. and came at the end of a difficult year punctuated by a strong yen, which has eroded profits of Japanese multinational companies, and the March 11 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster. ""I actually see this as a turning point for corporate Japan. Up until now, this would have been glossed over or swept under the rug. People would have ignored this,"" said William Saito, a member of the Japan Prime Minister's special commission on National Strategy and Policy. ""That this is such a commotion now, I think a lot of businesses understand that in order to get global respect, one needs to address this issue,"" Saito said. ""They're on notice and will have to change because of that."" Kikukawa, Mori and Yamada resigned in the wake of the allegations. The allegations have sparked investigations in Tokyo, London and New York. The former Olympus executives were charged with allegedly filing false financial reports in 2007 and 2008. The Olympus saga started with a five-page expose in Japanese magazine FACTA -- a small circulation magazine that has only nine people on staff -- on July 20 that raised questions over advisory fees of $687 million paid in 2008 for the purchase of Gyrus, a UK medical instruments firm. The article also questioned the $773 million paid for three small Japanese companies -- a face cream maker, a plastic container maker and a recycling business, each with fewer than 50 employees. Others charged include banker Akio Nakagawa, who advised Olympus on the Gyrus transaction. Olympus lost more than 75% of its share value in the weeks following the October 14 firing of former CEO Woodford, the first foreigner to lead the company, after Woodford went public with his claims. Woodford, a British executive who spent 30 years with Olympus before he was named the first foreign president last April, led a public campaign to fire the existing Olympus board and return to company management. He gave up that fight in January, saying he didn't have the backing of Japanese institutional investors in the company. The current Olympus board, led by President Shuichi Takayama, are expected to step down at an extraordinary shareholders meeting on April 20, when the new company management is expected to be named. CNN's Kyung Lah, Yoko Wakatsuki and Junko Ogura contributed to this report .","NEW: Seven men arrested in connection with $1.7 billion Olympus Corp fraud .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Beautiful and intelligent, and balancing a modern outlook with a deep concern for her people, Jordan's Queen Rania seems in many ways to represent the optimistic face of the Middle East's future. Not just a pretty face: Queen Rania has used her position to fight for better education for Jordanian youth. Since she entered the spotlight after she married then Prince Abdullah in 1993, she has become known for her philanthropic work, pushing for better educational facilities for Jordan's school children and supporting efforts to empower women. Feted by the West (she has been interviewed countless times, including a half-hour appearance on Oprah), she was named the third most beautiful woman in the world by Harpers and Queen magazine in 2005. She has used her considerable status -- Forbes magazine ranks her 81 in the world's 100 most powerful women -- to correct what she sees as misconceptions in the West about the Arab world. A beacon of hope then in a troubled region? Not exactly. The reality behind the picture perfect image is more complex. To a large extent Queen Rania remains a paradox -- a symbol of the contradictions that still blight the region as it tries to come to terms with modernity. She is the business graduate who left her job at a multinational to marry into a monarchy that has ruled Jordan for the last 60 years, at times with an iron rod. She may talk passionately about freedom of speech and equal rights. Yet Jordan's own human rights record under the stewardship of her husband King Abdullah II has hardly been exemplary, and has included accusations of terrorist suspects being tortured, harsh laws to clamp down on public dissent and the arrest without trial of critics of the government. Jordan also has one of the highest incidences in the Middle East of honor killings -- the practice of women being killed by male family members if they engage in pre-martial sex. To her credit, Rania is not burying her head in the sand over the problems of Jordan. She acknowledges, for example, that unemployment rates among young people stand at 25 percent, double the global average, and that ""creating jobs is one of the most important priorities for us."" The daughter of Palestinian parents, she is also acutely aware of the severe social problems that conflict has created in the wider region. She talks about a ""hope-gap"" in trouble spots such as Iraq and Palestinian areas, where young people can be sucked into a vortex of violence and where there are few, if any opportunities to rescue them. ""It's all about providing that opportunity, a sense of hope for the future generation because I believe that if that future generation is growing without that sense of hope, then we are looking at a very dangerous situation."" Faced with so many complexities in the current political and social climate in the Middle East, it's perhaps not that surprising that Rania is focusing so much of her energy on young people. As well as efforts to improve education, she has initiated an online debate on the video sharing site YouTube. The queen is asking viewers to send in comments about their ideas of Islam and the Arab world. She then appears and discusses her reaction to the comments. The conversation is due to run until International Youth Day on August 12. ""When I'm in the West I'm asked why do the Arabs hate us? When I'm in the Arab world I hear very negative comments about the West,"" she told CNN. ""The rising tensions between both sides is a fact of life, I don't think that anyone can deny it."" She wanted to take the debate online and ask young people to participate in order to ""bring them into the conversation because they are the ones that can change the discourse."" She said the Internet is a force for free speech, and that greater communications are making it harder for authoritarian regimes to stifle dialogue. ""If you don't like the comments that are out there the best way to tackle it is to respond to them and to put your side of the story."" A mother-of-four, she believes that young people should be allowed to be involved in the political process, not only because she is concerned they're being denied a voice but also because she says she thinks they have a huge amount to offer. She said young people need to be seen as ""active agents as opposed to just persons in the making and to do that we really need to educate them, engage them and empower them in the decision-making process."" That her idealistic pronouncements can seem at odds with the reality on the ground is not surprising, given just how difficult that reality is. That she cares enough to try and make difference is only to her credit.","Queen Rania married in to the Jordanian royal family in 1993 .

"(EW.com) -- For Adam Sandler, movie comedy is rock & roll — not just a way to make people laugh, but a way to strike a pose of scruffy defiance. At 45, he's still playing overgrown boy-men, but his characters these days aren't just emotionally stunted basket cases. They're jerks and rubes and loutish vulgarians, the more hideously unpresentable the better. And since we've all grown used to seeing Sandler play these incorrigible idiots, in a sense he has to keep upping the ante. It's his equivalent of playing that power chord just a little bit louder. Watching Sandler in ""That's My Boy,"" his latest assault on subtlety, good taste, and other values that we critics like to trash the star for dumping on, I can't say that I laughed a lot (though when I did laugh, it was big and loud). But on some level I marveled at the conviction that Adam Sandler pours into playing a character like Donny Berger, a boneheaded, loud-mouthed alcoholic loser from Boston. Wearing his hair in a greasy '80s shag, Sandler doesn't phone it in. He delivers every single line with the unspeakably annoying rasp of a rusty nail scraping on your brainpan, and he gives Donny what is, in a sense, a full range of moods: angry, irritated, pushy, noodgy, grasping, wheedling, whining. A real charmer. Just to make sure we know what kind of role model Donny is, hardly a scene goes by in which he doesn't have a Budweiser in his hand, and the vulgarities, too, spew out of him like beery foam. A lot of actors, by now, have learned to do a Boston accent, but Sandler gets something else: the blinkered, bellowing high dudgeon of a certain kind of in-your-face leech whom you can still find hovering in Boston sports bars. He makes Donny the Joe Six-Pack from hell. Long ago, Donny enjoyed a moment of tabloid infamy. Back in 1984, when he was just a teenager in gold chains, he got seduced by his sexpot high-school teacher, and when it came out that they were sleeping together, the scandal of it all made national headlines. The teacher, sent to prison for statutory rape, even had Donny's baby, whom Donny named Han Solo and (once he turned 18) raised as a single parent. But he was such a dismal father that his son disowned him. He also renamed himself Todd. As an adult, Todd is played by Andy Samberg as a persnickety hedge-fund manager about to be married to a stuck-up American princess (Leighton Meester). And that, of course, is when Donny comes crashing back into his life. ""That's My Boy"" is one of those comedies about a walking irritant, like What About Bob?, in which the joke — ultimately spun off from Green Acres — is that the mild, ordinary guy at the center of everything keeps trying to distance himself from the pest who has arrived to ruin his life, but everyone around him...adores the pest! The more Donny disgraces himself, the more he makes the kind of cringe-worthy sexual jokes that Andrew Dice Clay would have turned up his nose at, the more everyone in Todd's circle thinks he's the life of the party. I only wish it were a fresher party. Donny wins everyone over, for instance, by reviving ''Wassup!'' as a catch phrase. Seriously? That's what Sandler now regards as a mischievous joke? Still, for a while, Andy Samberg makes a good squirmer. His Todd is so neurotically nice that he doesn't even experience his own exasperation, even as we see the steam coming out of his ears. Where Sandler compromises his whole comedy-as-rock-&-roll thing is that he's so into making Donny a big teddy bear inside, a guy who just wants to bond with his son, that the movie starts to lose its edge. It also stretches out far too long. (Did it really need to clock in at nearly two hours?) Donny takes Todd and his friends out for a bachelor party, and it's on this voyage into the night that Todd begins to lose his inhibitions and get won over to the ways of excess — to the Donny Way. Big mistake! Lots of jokes about strippers and happy endings follow, and Todd gets so unhinged that he barfs all over his fiancée's wedding dress. The movie was a lot funnier when Donny and Todd were foils. Of course, never underestimate the importance of guy-on-guy sentimentality in the Adam Sandler universe. It's his way of making his fans feel as if he's high-fiving them, or maybe giving them a group hug. But Sandler, bottom line, is too good at playing louts like Donny to spend this much energy getting us to like them. Grade: B- . See full story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Ferran Adria delights in doing things differently. He's credited with inventing over 1,800 recipes for his restaurant El Bulli -- consistently rated the world's best -- and elevating cooking to a new level, fusing gastronomy with art and science. ""One of the big reasons why El Bulli is where it is, is because we talk to other disciplines. We are seeing the revolution of communications in cooking,"" he says. Adria has become something of a culinary superstar who has given lectures across the world on his innovative approach to food and his face has been splashed on the cover of international publications. ""Everything that has happened is a gift,"" he says. ""When I was on the cover of The New York Times I couldn't believe it. What is a cook doing there? I have been invited to Harvard as a visiting professor! How could I have dreamed of this? I never expected this."" It's a long way from where he imagined he would be when he took his first job in a restaurant kitchen aged 17. That was more to do with a teenage need to fund a summer vacation rather than the makings of a life's vocation. Adria's interest in cooking began at home in Barcelona with his parents and younger brother Albert, but then becoming a footballer was of greater interest to the young Ferran. ""Neither Albert nor I studied cooking. Neither of us wanted to be cooks. So we have the same way of thinking. We ask why about things,"" Adria says. Yet by the time Adria was 24 he was the head chef at El Bulli on the Catalan coast in northeastern Spain, at that time a struggling restaurant in danger of losing its Michelin-star rating. Today El Bulli is the benchmark for the world's greatest culinary experience. Only 8,000 people are served there each year despite millions of requests for a table. Dining is less about enjoying a meal as indulging in an experience that can take a whole day. The average cost is $400, involving dishes prepared with almost molecular precision. ""You don't make money with avant garde cuisine. This is not a business. We could auction reservations on eBay. But that would be prostitution,"" says Adria. It seems fitting that the creations emanating from his kitchen should be less than 10 miles from the former home of artist, Salvador Dali. From ""pina colada pillow"" cocktails to extracting the unique flavor of prawn heads, his kitchen team provide the unexpected in a way the surrealist would likely have approved of. ""Every time I meet something I did not know existed I say, 'Nice to meet you,' because it extended my idea of what life is about and that is what Ferran is doing,"" says Vincente Todoli, former curator of London's Tate Modern. ""Art or not art? I don't care but certainly this is an experience that takes me into other realms."" Adria also has his attention fixed on venturing into new territory. Last year he announced that El Bulli would close its doors for good in the summer of 2011. In its place will come the El Bulli Foundation, a ""think tank of gastronomic creativity"" that Adria will continue to hone until it opens in 2014. ""This could become a vast creative network, thousands of people bringing in ideas. It is going to change the relationship between creativity and society,"" Adria says. ""This is a lot more than a cooking project. It's a social project. The objective of the foundation is to continue creating and to share everything via Internet."" Adria's interest in connecting with a larger world has already seen him partner with technology and communications company Telefonica in Spain to help develop El Bulli Foundation's IT. But he's also gone back to his roots, embarking on smaller projects including a tapas and cocktail bar in Barcelona with his brother. The tapas bar Tickets will open later this Spring, while 41 Degrees is bringing a range of cocktails to Barcelona's bar scene. ""We needed a place in Barcelona for friends. A place like this is much more relaxed than El Bulli,"" Adria says of 41 Degrees. ""There will be tapas for 5 or 6 euros ($6.7 to $8). It is not the same. The pressure is very different."" ""The easy option for me was to just stop. But when you see how people react (to El Bulli) you realize it's worth (pursuing a new venture).","Ferran Adria is the head chef of El Bulli, thought of as the world's best restaurant .

"(CNN) -- The offices of SPARK, a nationwide coalition of girls-only programs, were abuzz Monday as news spread about Augusta National's decision to allow female members for the first time in its 80-year history. ""Shock"" was a common sentiment, the organization's executive director said, not because the famed Augusta, Georgia, club finally decided to open its doors to another gender, but because they hadn't done so until now. ""The girls honestly were pretty surprised that Augusta had been discriminating against women like this,"" said Dana Edell, referring to the teenagers that comprise much of SPARK's staff. ""They are horrified that (the club) could legally and blatantly (exclude women)."" Augusta National Golf Club admits first female members . Most of these girls were in elementary school when women's rights activist Martha Burk first ratcheted up public pressure on what was then probably America's best known men's-only club. Yet the majority of those women's rights activists responding to Monday's news were well aware of Augusta National's history and that of the decade-long fight to force it to reverse its policy, not to mention the even longer campaign for gender equality. For them, hearing former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina businesswoman Darla Moore can now hang out in Augusta's clubhouse with corporate and other leaders from around the Southeast and nation was cause for celebration. Burk admitted that her first reaction, upon hearing of Augusta National chairman Billy Payne's statement, was ""we won -- and we did."" Augusta National admits one of the 'toughest' women in business . ""By we, I mean the women's movement and women in the United States, particularly those in business,"" she said. But Burk, the co-founder of the Center for Advancement of Public Policy, also admitted feeling personally vindicated. She recalled receiving death threats after she began challenging Augusta National's membership policies in 2002, hoping to give more female leaders an ""in"" in one of the most exclusive clubs. ""It wasn't a lack of worthy women"" that prevented women from being part of the club, said Gloria Feldt, an activist and author who calls herself a friend of Burk's. ""It was really about keeping an old, now outdated power structure in place."" Many women who had a rooting interest in the fight, albeit not on the frontlines like Burk, cheered Monday's announcement. They included Billie Jean King, the tennis player known by some as much for her Battle of the Sexes matches with Bobby Riggs as her 39 Grand Slam singles and doubles titles. Membership is latest honor for trailblazer Rice . ""Slowly but surely lots of crumbs (add) up to a cake,"" she said, on Twitter, of how the announcement was a milestone in women's quest for equality. Others used social media to add a dose of perspective, and humor. Sports Illustrated columnist Steve Rushin was one of a few who suggested that ""the ladies' club championship at Augusta"" -- featuring Rice, Moore and no one else -- ""should be a doozy."" Then there was satirist Andy Borowitz, who offered a reality check along with his characteristic sarcasm. ""Totally stoked about Augusta National's diversity now that it's .6% female,"" he wrote on Twitter. Women's rights advocates readily admitted the fact the club hosting the prestigious Masters golf tournament let two women in doesn't mean their effort to achieve gender equality is over, or that even a fraction of women will ever join Rice and Moore at Augusta. That's especially true when it comes to the makeup of corporate America's leadership, said Feldt, a former president of Planned Parenthood. ""It's a long road ahead because women remain in less than 20% of the top leadership positions across all sectors of business,"" she said. Still, Edell -- from SPARK, which bills itself as a ""girls-fueled activist movement"" -- said she feels more optimistic today about opportunities for her young team members and others girls like them than she did before Augusta National's announcement. ""This just gives them optimism and hope that the world is changing,"" Edell said. ""And hopefully, for the next generation, it will be totally unacceptable and intolerable and unprofitable for clubs like that to exclude girls.""

"London (CNN) -- Shafilea Ahmed's parents have long denied killing their pretty teenage daughter for shaming the family, but the ""honor murder"" case that has gripped Britain took an unexpected turn this week. Shafilea's mother, Farzana, abruptly changed her story in court and implicated her husband, Iftikhar, in the killing, CNN affiliate ITV reported Monday. Iftikhar and Farzana Ahmed are on trial in Chester, England, accused of killing Shafilea, 17, (pictured left) in September 2003. They have pleaded not guilty. Her dismembered body was found on a riverbank months after she disappeared. She had been stripped of anything that would identify her, prosecutor Andrew Edis told the jury in May, according to ITV. Newspapers, television and radio have all been reporting on the prosecution case that Shafilea's parents killed her because they felt her ""Western"" lifestyle brought shame on the family. Shafilea's sister Alesha testified last month that she saw her parents kill the teen by stuffing a plastic bag into her mouth. She said her parents were angry that Shafilea was wearing a short-sleeved, V-neck top, and no sweater, on the night she was killed. ""Just end it here,"" Farzana said to Iftikhar, according to their daughter. They pushed Shafilea down onto a sofa and suffocated her despite her struggles, Alesha testified. Prosecutor Edis called it ""an act of suffocation by both parents acting together."" Alesha Ahmed did not tell police she had seen the killing until 2010, after she was detained by police in connection with a robbery of the family's home, ITV reported. She has pleaded guilty to robbery. Prosecutors said she had not been offered any sort of deal in exchange for testifying against her parents. She has testified that both her parents physically abused Shafilea ""every day"" over the course of five years, and that her mother did it more ""because she was at home more."" On Monday, Farzana unexpectedly said she had seen her husband attack Shafilea. She said that she tried to intervene to protect the girl, but that her husband pushed her away and punched her, ITV reported. ""Extremely scared,"" she fled the room and stayed in a bedroom with other children until she heard a car leaving 20 minutes later. When her husband returned alone, she asked where their daughter was. ""If you care for your dear life and that of your children, don't ever ask me this question again,"" he told her, ITV reported. Indian police: Man chops off daughter's head, citing her 'indecent behavior' Farzana Ahmed testified Monday that only one of their children, Mevish, was present when she saw her husband attacking Shafilea. The jury was told that Shafilea had been taken to Pakistan for a hastily arranged marriage before her death, and drank bleach there when her parents suggested she was staying there when the rest of the family returned to England, ITV reported. She was hospitalized for three months after the family came home because of the bleach incident, Alesha testified. Alesha testified in May that her parents were very strict with their daughters, ITV reported. ""Our family was very restricted. It was very different. The Pakistani culture is more restrictive in terms of what you can wear or do,"" she said. The trial began in May and is expected to last several more weeks, prosecutors say. Reliable figures of the number of honor murders around the world are hard to come by, but the United Nations Population Fund has estimated there could be 5,000 per year. Family convicted in Canada 'honor murders' So-called honor murders are a significant enough problem in Britain that the country's Crown Prosecution Service has an expert specializing in cases where members of a family kill relatives because of behavior that they say shames the family. The CPS began keeping statistics on honor violence in April 2010 and prosecuted 234 cases in the following year, just over half of which were successful. The CPS expert, Nazir Afzal, told CNN earlier this year that convicting perpetrators can be difficult. ""There is a wall of silence around this, and people are not prepared to talk,"" he said. But Afzal insisted that it was ""absolutely important that you bring every single person to justice, because you want to deter other people from doing it."" There is a perception that the crime is particularly common among Muslims, but one vocal British campaigner says not all honor violence is perpetrated by Muslims. Disappearance, then discovery, leads to 'honor killing' outrage . Jasvinder Sanghera, who was the victim of a forced marriage, is not Muslim; she is Sikh. ""Significant cases are happening within South Asian communities, be it Pakistani, Indian, Sikh, Muslim, Kurdish, Iranian, Middle Eastern communities,"" she said. Afzal says ""no faith on Earth"" justifies killing. ""At the end of the day, murder is murder,"" he said. ""Abrahamic faiths say 'Thou shalt not kill.' At the end of the day, nobody should die for this."" The killings take place in many parts of the world, experts say. Indian father accused of killing baby 'for being a girl' ""It's definitely a problem that happens in many different places: the Middle East, Pakistan, Bangladesh and among immigrant communities in North America,"" said Nadya Khalife, a researcher on women's rights in the Arab world for Human Rights Watch. Several Arab countries and territories, including Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, Yemen and the Palestinian territories, have laws providing lesser sentences for honor murders than for other murders, Human Rights Watch says. Egypt and Jordan also have laws that have been interpreted to allow reduced sentences for honor crimes, the group says. CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this report.","Shafilea Ahmed's parents are accused of killing the 17-year-old in an ""honor murder""

"(CNN) -- Allyson Felix restored pride to American sprinting on Wednesday by claiming gold in the women's 200 meter and denying Jamaican rival Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce an Olympic double. Felix used her elegant stride to good effect down the finishing stretch to pull clear of Fraser-Pryce, who won Saturday's 100m race while the U.S. runner missed out on a medal. Carmelita Jeter joined her compatriot Felix on the podium by claiming third place ahead of Jamaica's two-time defending champion Veronica Campbell-Brown. Felix had been forced to settle for silvers in 2004 and 2008 behind Campbell-Brown, but this time made no mistake as she added to her three 200m world titles with a fast time of 21.88 seconds. ""Finally, it's been a long time coming , I've waited so long for this moment, I'm just overjoyed,"" she told UK broadcaster the BBC. However, Jamaica looks set to claim gold in the men's equivalent as defending champion Usain Bolt cantered into the final by winning his semifinal in 20.18 seconds. Bolt has already made a successful defense of his 100m title in London and again the main opposition to another 200m triumph looks to be in the form of his teammate and training partner Yohan Blake. Blake won the first semifinal in 20.01, jogging across the line, but Bolt is confident he will double up. ""No doubt about it,"" he told BBC Sport. ""This is my favorite event and I'm really looking forward to it."" In other final action Wednesday, Aries Merritt won the 110m men's hurdles for the United States in a fast personal best time of 12.92 seconds. His teammate Jason Richardson, the world champion from last year in Daegu, took silver in 13.04 second with Jamaican Hansle Parchment earning a surprise bronze in a new national record of 13.12 seconds. Defending champion Dayron Robles of Cuba made a good start but pulled out at halfway with a hamstring injury. The third track and field gold of the night for the U.S. went to Brittney Reese, who won the women's long jump with a leap of 7.12 meters. Russian Elena Sokolova took the silver with 7.07m, with American Janay Deloach in bronze with 6.89m.

"(CNN) -- Some of the world's top tennis stars will have the honor of carrying their countries' flags at Friday's opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympics, but one of the sport's biggest names is taking a back seat. Not due to injury, like Beijing 2008 singles champion Rafael Nadal -- who has had to relinquish his role as Spain's flag bearer -- but because one of the game's renowned gentlemen thinks it's time to share the prestigious job. While former world No. 1s Novak Djokovic and Maria Sharapova will lead the way for Serbia and Russia, Switzerland's team will be led into the Olympic stadium by a gold medalist, and one of the European nation's finest tennis players -- though he's not the one that you'd expect to see in the limelight. Stanislas Wawrinka has spent his career in the shadow of Roger Federer, but on Friday the eyes of the world will be on the man known as ""Stan"" -- and not his great friend. Russian Olympic first for Sharapova . World No. 1 Federer, the most successful men's tennis player of any era, declined the chance to carry the Swiss flag for the third time. ""I just felt it was important to give someone else a chance. In Switzerland we believe that,"" the 30-year-old said. ""I told the Swiss Olympic Committee that they should choose someone else and they chose my partner, Stan Wawrinka. It's a great, great honor for him. I couldn't have won the gold without him, everybody knows that. I think they chose the right guy."" A tale of two careers . Wawrinka has won three tournament titles to Federer's 75, and $5.5 million in prize money to the 16-time grand slam champion's $73 million, but they have one thing in common: an Olympic gold medal. Four years ago in Beijing, seeded only fourth, the Swiss duo overcame the odds to win the men's doubles competition -- cementing a partnership that began when they started practicing together in the late 1990s. Wawrinka, nearly four years Federer's junior, was just 16 at the time. ""He was already number six in the world -- after 10 minutes I was completely red!"" Wawrinka told CNN's Open Court of his first session with Federer. ""I was dead tired, and so nervous to play with him. ""He's the best, it's good for any player. We'll be practicing one week and then playing each other the next, but it's not the fact that we share nationalities that makes playing him hard, it's that he's the best in the world."" American idol . Wawrinka, like Federer, idolized seven-time Wimbledon winner Pete Sampras when he was growing up. ""I wasn't good until I was 17 -- I never even won the Swiss Championship,"" the 2003 French Open boys' champion said. ""Sampras was a great athlete and I was a big fan. That's why I focus on being an allrounder."" Federer matched Sampras' record tally at the All England Club when he beat Andy Murray in this month's final, and Wawrinka will face Britain's world No. 4 in the opening round of the Olympic singles competition. Despite slipping down the world rankings from a career high of ninth in 2009 to 25th ahead of London 2012, Wawrinka still holds hopes of success. ""I feel I'm playing the best tennis of my career right now -- the top 40 is just so strong, the strongest it's ever been, maybe. With this top 40 you have to fight for every match. To break back into it is more mental than physical, for sure. It's about confidence,"" he said . ""Sometimes I put too much pressure on myself. It's not good. I'm too tight, because I want to win. That's why I need to focus on what's going on on the court, not off of it."" Family ties . His drop in form coincided with the birth of his first child, daughter Alexia, in 2010, while last year he separated from his wife Ilham Vuilloud. ""Having a daughter and being a tennis pro changes everything. It's hard to train so much, but it's great to see she's interested in what I'm doing -- if I'm playing tennis, she wants to play tennis,"" he said. Wawrinka fondly recalls Beijing, where he and Federer beat top-ranked doubles duo Mike and Bob Bryan in the semifinals before winning gold. ""We played our best tennis against the Bryan brothers -- it was the toughest and most important win. Whilst we talked strategy for the finals afterwards, it was made easier knowing we were playing great tennis,"" he said. ""In the first game I wasn't playing well, but Roger really helped me to be comfortable. We've known each other for so long, but even we were surprised at how easy we found it on the court. It was so natural, and talking helped a lot -- we're very honest around the court."" Their close relationship translated well off the court too, particularly in the Olympic Village. ""At night all of the Swiss athletes would play cards. We played a lot against the soccer team -- we were the best though, you can ask them!"" Togther for life . If Federer's inclusion for China was a foregone conclusion, Wawrinka's presence was anything but guaranteed. ""Roger had a lot of great players to choose from (as a partner). It was a tough choice but in the end he chose me. We were having a great time and I think that's part of the reason we won -- I was happy for him and he was happy for me,"" he said. ""I was almost crying at the medal ceremony. We had to joke around to stop the tears and start laughing instead. We used our friendship to stop from crying in front of everybody! ""It was the best moment of my career because it wasn't just about tennis. It was about sport, it was about Switzerland, it's a dream for everyone and to share it with someone added to the enjoyment."" Federer will go into London 2012 seeking the one major title that eludes him -- Olympic gold in the singles. He begins his campaign against Colombia's Alejandro Falla, the man who took him to five sets at Wimbledon in 2010. Federer reached the semifinals as a teenager at Sydney 2000 but lost in the playoff for the bronze, then crashed out in the second round in Athens and the last eight in Beijing. ""The day before the (doubles) quarterfinals Roger lost to James Blake in the singles and I had to prove to him that he could trust me,"" Wawrinka said. ""Once we started playing well I could tell he got over the loss and said to himself, 'Okay, let's do something in the doubles now.' That was the moment, and now we have a gold medal -- together, for life.""","Stanislas Wawrinka will carry Switzerland's Olympic flag for London 2012 .

"(Oprah) -- Kick back — there's a reason they call them beach reads. ""Seating Arrangements"" by Maggie Shipstead . Winn Van Meter has everything an affluent person could hope for: a devoted wife of almost 30 years, two daughters, a privileged life in Connecticut, and a summer home on Waskeke — a fictional island resembling Nantucket. Despite his comforts, Winn suffers from a typical midlife dissatisfaction: ""He had almost everything he could think to want, and yet still ambivalence bleached his world to an anemic pallor."" Maggie Shipstead's ""Seating Arrangements"" is a whip-smart and engaging debut novel, set on Waskeke over the course of three days. Winn's oldest daughter, Daphne, is pregnant and getting married. His youngest daughter is lovelorn and mourning a recent abortion. Strong personalities clash as Winn struggles with his long-burning attraction to one of Daphne's gorgeous and wildly flirtatious bridesmaids, Agatha, as his marriage grows stale. ""He could not be sure that he had ever been in love with Biddy, or with anyone for that matter, but Biddy was the woman he had felt the most for.""

But when neither her husband nor her grown son notices anything out of the ordinary, Clover realizes she's become exactly what she often feels: overlooked. Jeanne Ray's newest novel, ""Calling Invisible Women,"" tells the humorous, touching story of how Clover reclaims her sense of self. Over the years, her once-thriving journalism career has shrunk to a weekly gardening column, and she's filled her days walking the dog, getting dinner on the table and being a pediatrician's dutiful wife. But after she ""disappears,"" she finds a support group of women all suffering from the same baffling disorder. Emboldened by this sisterhood and the freedom her condition gives her, Clover sees ""a whole world of beauty and injustice I had never dared to notice before."" Stripping off her clothes to go undetected, she becomes a sort of superhero: punishing bullies on the school bus, halting bank robberies, preventing her son from getting a tattoo — not to mention reigniting her career as an investigative journalist.

"(Wired) -- When the new iPad says it's 100% fully charged, it may actually not be -- at least that's been the word on the web the past few days. This has caused concern among iPad users hoping to get the most out of their device's battery life, and the normally tight-lipped Apple has responded in order to clarify the issue. Here's what's going on: . When the iPad is plugged in and reaches a full charge, it actually releases a small percentage of the charge, then charges back up, repeating this process until you unplug it. Once the iPad says it has reached ""100%,"" you are guaranteed at least 10 hours of battery life, which is what Apple promises of the tablet. This, according to Apple VP of product marketing Michael Tchao, is done so that devices can maintain optimum charge. ""That circuitry is designed so you can keep your device plugged in as long as you would like,"" Tchao told AllThingsD. ""It's a great feature that's always been in iOS."" Apple did not immediately respond to our request for further comment. DisplayMate's Raymond Soneira first noticed the issue in his testing of the new iPad, and published his findings online.""If the new iPad is fully charged overnight, then my tests show it will run 11.6 hours, which is 1.2 hours longer than if it just charged to 100%,"" Soneira wrote in an email. Whatever is going on inside the battery, there is no need for alarm -- nobody's actually having serious battery issues, like what happened when iOS 5 and the iPhone 4S debuted.

"(CNN) -- Over the course of more than 15 years, ""Resident Evil"" has established a rich history as one of the video game world's most storied franchises. Sadly, ""Resident Evil: Raccoon City"" fails to add to that rich history, serving up ordinary squad-based game play and limited threats from the franchise's iconic zombies. The latest venture into the zombie-filled world by Capcom is supposed to take place in time between between two other games in the series, ""Resident Evil 2"" and ""Resident Evil: Nemesis."" This time, you play as a member of the Wolfpack squad for the always dubious Umbrella Corporation. You're tasked with retrieving a virus that turns people into the undead creatures before the U.S. military can get it. Raccoon City is the location where the zombie phenomena first occurred and has been the setting in many of the ""Resident Evil"" games. Working for the bad guys in this title was supposed to be a refreshing change from others in the series. And it might have worked, if the squad-based third-person shooter game didn't feel more like a poorly lit ""Call of Duty"" than what we've come to expect from the ""Resident Evil"" franchise. Each member of your squad specializes in a different field (stealth, explosives, recon, etc.), and you play as one of four soldiers fighting their way through Raccoon City. Either your friends can fill in the roles of the other three squad members or the game will control the others. You get to choose your special abilities and weapons at the beginning of each mission, but these are all locked down once the game starts. The weapons are similar to those you'd find in a first-person shooter, and your character can carry one sidearm and one long-barreled weapon. Ammo and other weapons are sprinkled throughout the battleground and very rarely will you find yourself without bullets. There are a couple of high-powered, single-use weapons (grenade launchers, flamethrower) that can't be replenished with additional ammo. If you use one of these, make sure you can pick up another weapon as soon as you run out of fuel or grenades. One of the most frustrating aspects of combat is what I call ""magnetic cover."" If you're trying to use cover from your enemies while you're moving, you end up essentially plastered to a wall if you get even close to it. Forget about moving stealthily from one covered spot to another. If you want to progress, you have to stand up, exposing yourself to enemy fire, then move to the next safe spot. The artificial intelligence that runs the game is fair, but its decisions are sometimes hard to understand. Your squadmates will rush into a room with guns blazing at times when the team could have easily sneaked past. At other times, they will arbitrarily fling themselves to the ground for no apparent reason. At least they are good in a fight and and very effective at taking the heat off your character. Be sure to have a medic in your squad to help heal injured party members. Most of the opponents are not zombies. You'll spend a lot of time battling the U.S. military in firefights, not that the soldiers you face seem much smarter than the undead. Character models for the soldiers and the zombies are reused often. You'll see the same zombie police officer, zombie large guy and zombie girl in short-shorts over and over again. You will kill a lot of living and nonliving enemies in this game. The experience points you gain can be used at the beginning of each mission to upgrade weapons or personal abilities. But, even if you don't use any upgrades at all, you will still be able to succeed. The passive abilities that help you find items and enemies on your mini-map are probably the most useful. None of the weapon upgrades felt like they were necessary. ""Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City"" ultimately comes off as a mundane, average shooter that abandons its heritage in the zombie/horror genre. There aren't enough zombies and too many living-breathing enemies to truly feel like a worthy outing for this franchise. The ending flies in the face of ""Resident Evil's"" history and leaves more questions unanswered. It feels half-done with no real finale. Obviously, the ending leaves the door open for another shooter in this series. Unfortunately, it doesn't really deserve one. ""Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City"" is currently available in North America, Australia and Europe. It will be available in Japan on April 26. It is available for Windows PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is rated 'M for Mature' due to blood and gore, intense violence, and strong language.

"(CNN) -- It's not just anyone who gets honored by having a bloodsucker named after him. Bob Marley, the late reggae star known for messages of peace and understanding as well as a song about shooting a sheriff, is the latest cultural icon to have a species names after him, according to a news release from the National Science Foundation. The Gnathia marleyi is tiny crustacean that attaches itself to fish that inhabit coral reefs in the Caribbean. Paul Sikkel, an assistant professor of marine ecology and a field marine biologist at Arkansas State University, discovered the creature and decided to honor the musician. Bob Marley's music used to help famine victims in Africa . ""I named this species, which is truly a natural wonder, after Marley because of my respect and admiration for Marley's music. Plus, this species is as uniquely Caribbean as was Marley,"" he said. Sikkel describes his research in the June 6 edition of Zootaxia, a journal for animal taxonomists (folks who classify species). The Gnathia marleyi are sneaky little critters. They hide among coral rubble or algae and ambush unsuspecting fish, infesting them. The juveniles munch away, but adults apparently skip a meal or 21. ""We believe that adults subsist for two to three weeks on the last feedings they had as juveniles and then die, hopefully after they have reproduced,"" Sikkel said. Sikkel's team is studying the relationship between coral reef destruction and the parasites. The more degradation there is, the more launching pads for the bloodsuckers -- and the more fish are attacked. You may get a chance to see these Marley creatures yourself; Sikkel and his team have sent some to the American Museum of Natural History in New York. They are discussing housing an exhibit there. Other famous folk who have had a species named in honor of them include President Obama (a lichen), Comedian Stephen Colbert (a bug) and Elvis Presley (a wasp).

"(CNN) -- Tottenham was made to endure a frustrating night at White Hart Lane after being held to a goalless draw by Lazio. In front of watching UEFA President Michel Platini, Tottenham had three 'goals' disallowed by Romanian referee Ovidiu Hategen during an enthralling contest.

"El Cajon, California (CNN) -- Khalid Yohana was 7 years old when war reached his hometown of Mosul, Iraq. For years, even the simplest activities, like walking to school, were an ordeal. ""It was too scary to go outside much,"" Yohana, now 16, remembers. ""If you walk on the street ... you're nervous you'd get killed."" A group of men once tried to kidnap his father, a chef at a Baghdad restaurant that catered to Americans. The attempt failed, but a threatening letter arrived at his family's home that same night. ""They warned us to get out of the country or they would kill us. ... I was really scared,"" Yohana said. The family fled to a small village north, but when Yohana's school was bombed a year later, they left Iraq for good. They traveled to Beirut, Lebanon, and applied for refugee status so they could move to the United States legally. In 2010, Yohana and his family arrived in San Diego. The family appreciated the safety of their new home, but they also encountered new problems. Yohana's father struggled to find work, and the entire family found it challenging to navigate a new country and culture. ""It was really hard because we (didn't) speak the language,"" Yohana said. He was often so discouraged by his poor English that he wouldn't even try to do his homework. The social isolation was worse. ""It was really hard to find friends,"" Yohana said. ""I was just sitting at home."" While working as a refugee case manager for a nonprofit, Mark Kabban saw many families like Yohana's struggle to find their footing in the United States. ""You lose a lot of your dignity when you become a refugee,"" Kabban said. ""You have to flee your country, depend on others. You lose your self-esteem."" Kabban said the transition can be particularly challenging for children, who face educational and social barriers. The stress they endure often puts them at risk of getting on the wrong track. ""Their families have sacrificed everything for them to get here. So if (their kids) don't succeed, that's the biggest tragedy,"" said Kabban, 25. ""It's something that I'm not going to allow."" To help support young refugees, Kabban started the YALLA program in 2009. The name is an acronym for Youth And Leaders Living Actively, but in Arabic it simply means ""Let's go."" YALLA provides free tutoring and soccer training to 200 boys and girls in the San Diego area. While soccer is what mostly motivates the players, it's just a carrot to Kabban. Many of his players have missed years of formal schooling on their road to the United States, so the mandatory twice-a-week tutoring sessions are an integral part of the program. ""When they get here, they're years behind, and they're years behind in a different language,"" Kabban said. ""So the need is just immense. We're working to get them literate in English, getting them ... caught up."" The YALLA staff also makes sure the players are registered to receive 25 hours of one-on-one tutoring from a statewide program. When necessary, YALLA also provides additional tutoring to those who are struggling. The hope is to help everyone get up to grade level and on a path to college. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2012 CNN Heroes . According to the U.S. State Department, more than 10,000 refugees from around the world have moved to the San Diego area legally since 2007, making it one of the largest refugee resettlement areas in the country. Many of those newcomers, like Yohana, are Iraqis who are under 18. The vast majority live in El Cajon, a city in San Diego County where YALLA is based. Mark spreads the word about the group by visiting area schools. Most of the players in the program are Iraqi, but the group has players from across the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Sometimes ethnic and religious differences can lead to conflict, but Kabban says that as the soccer season progresses, the differences fall by the wayside. ""Their families have endured the same struggles,"" Kabban said. ""When they realize that ... they become like brothers and sisters."" Some children have lost more than their homeland. Some have witnessed one of their parents being killed, or they've been kidnapped and tortured themselves. Kabban, who helps run many of the practices, tries to keep the atmosphere serious but fun so that time on the field is a much-needed escape. ""Soccer is (the) best therapy,"" Kabban said. ""They have an hour or two to forget about everything and just be kids."" Kabban cares deeply because he faced many of the challenges the refugees are experiencing. He was never officially a refugee, but his family left Beirut during Lebanon's 15-year civil war, a conflict in which three members of his extended family were killed. Kabban's family lived in several places -- including the United States, where his father attended college -- before permanently immigrating to the San Diego area when Kabban was 9. For him, the social adjustment was particularly rough. ""I had all the wrong clothes on, and I got made fun of,"" he said. ""They called me 'poor kid.' My self-esteem was really, really low."" That changed when he discovered American football, scoring a touchdown the first time he got the ball. ""Sports was the way I got confident, made friends and felt I was like other kids,"" he said. He went on to earn a football scholarship at Baker University, a small private school in Kansas where he studied foreign relations. After graduating in 2008, Kabban planned to go to Egypt to get a graduate degree in refugee studies. But on a visit home that summer, he learned about the large influx of refugees that San Diego had experienced in recent years. ""I started thinking to myself, 'Why am I going halfway across the world to learn about refugees when they're all here in my own hometown?' "" he said. Instead of going to graduate school, Kabban got a job with Catholic Charities, helping refugees settle into their new lives. He was troubled to see so many children sitting at home, alienated, but he also noticed how they lit up when they saw a soccer ball. One day, he brought a ball with him while making a home visit. As he approached the apartment complex, he heard a boy yell the Arabic word for ball. Kabban began kicking it around with him, and within minutes, 20 kids had joined the game. That moment gave Kabban the inspiration for YALLA's approach. Although the organization is relatively new, YALLA has managed to get funding from local foundations and businesses. Everything -- tutoring, soccer and occasional field trips -- is provided at no cost, something the kids appreciate, as nearly all of them know that money is tight at home. Kabban has also made it a priority to reach out to those who aren't refugees. When refugees started arriving in the area, there was tension in schools between them, Latinos and African-Americans. To counteract this, Kabban started the Peacebuilders League, a soccer league open to everyone in the area. ""We wanted to bring them all together and start making a community,"" he said. ""Now it looks like the World Cup here every Sunday."" Ultimately, Kabban hopes to build a ""peace-building"" charter school for refugees, immigrants and marginalized youth that would use soccer in a formal college prep program. Kabban's commitment to the organization is so strong that for more than a year he has worked full-time without a salary, living off his savings. The kids at YALLA know he quit his job for them, and they're quick to acknowledge the huge difference he has made in their lives. ""I don't know the way (to) say thank you to Coach Mark,"" Yohana said. ""They helped me to find friends, and they (taught) me how to speak English. ... Now, with YALLA and Coach Mark, it's a fun life."" Stories like that are what push Kabban to keep going. ""This country gave my family the chance to succeed,"" he said. ""I want to help these kids do the same thing."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Liverpool have suffered their worst opening day defeat since 1937, losing 3-0 to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. Arsenal, in their first game since Robin Van Persie's departure, could only manage a goalless draw at home to Sunderland. Elsewhere, the Premier League began in explosive style, as Swansea recorded a 5-0 win over QPR, Fulham also beat Norwich by a five goal margin, West Ham celebrated their return to England's top division with a 1-0 victory over Aston Villa, while Reading and Stoke shared the points in a 1-1 draw. Liverpool and West Bromwich were both playing their first games under new management, with Brendan Rodgers having moved to Anfield from Swansea and Steve Clarke taking his first managerial post at Albion after being sacked from his assistant manager's role with Liverpool at the end of last season. ""I thought the scoreline was harsh, I've got to be honest,"" Rodgers told the Liverpool website. ""After the first couple of minutes of the game, we got good control and rhythm in our game. Up until they scored the first goal, it looked as though we were the team who were going to get it. Liverpool finished the game with ten men, after defender Daniel Agger was sent off for a foul on West Bromwich striker Shane Long, giving away a penalty in the process. ""Obviously then with 10 men and chasing the game, it becomes difficult,"" the former Swansea manager explained. ""We conceded a penalty and then the sending off kills you, really. Especially for a new team that is coming together in terms of the structure and ideas."" Liverpool have not had such a disastrous start since Chelsea beat them 6-1 on the opening day of the 1937 season. Boos rang around the Emirates as the final whistle blew on the first game of Arsenal's post-Van Persie era. Manager Arsene Wenger gave debuts to new signings Lukas Podolski and Santi Cazorla, and introduced Olivier Giroud in the second half for the Frenchman's first competitive showing in an Arsenal shirt. Despite controlling the majority of the play, Arsenal couldn't find the net to get their season off to a winning start. ""We played with a good spirit. We were serious, we put the effort in. Our basic fitness is alright but we lack sharpness and fluency at the moment to be dangerous in the final third."" Wenger told the Arsenal website. ""The few chances we had, we couldn't convert them. Sunderland always play the same way against us, in the final third and defensively, and if you're not sharp enough to make the difference early in the game it becomes difficult."" Sunderland put in a dogged display to take their first point of the season, and had a couple of opportunities to win the match from set pieces, despite their defensive set up. ""It was a terrific performance by the team, considering that after about 60 odd minutes we were out on our feet,"" manager Martin O'Neill told the club's website. ""It was a very warm day, we were away from home and we had to soak up pressure. I thought we were really excellent; it was a brilliant effort. ""We've got a point, we're off the mark and we've got a home game to look forward to."" In South-West London, Queens Park Rangers were hoping to fulfill some of their pre-season promise. After a number of high profile signings, such as Ji-Sung Park from Manchester United and Jose Bosingwa from Chelsea, hopes were high that the club could avoid the relegation struggle they faced last year. Swansea, widely tipped as relegation candidates this season, put in an incredible performance to sour the mood at Rangers' home ground, Loftus Road. ""It's always nice to win your first game of the season and to win away from home is always important because it can give you so much confidence going forward,"" explained Swansea manager Michael Laudrup to the club website. ""It gives us something to build on. But the players are the most important, and I'm delighted for them."" Two goals for new signing Michu got the Welsh side's season under way, and QPR never looked capable of a recovery. ""It was a wake up call. Maybe everybody was getting a little but excited about what's ahead of us but we, as a group, understand there's a lot of hard work needed,"" Rangers manager Mark Hughes told the club's website. ""Today wasn't the level I expect us to perform at. You can make all the excuses in the world that it was a hot day and the first game of the season, but that doesn't wash with me. We need to perform better. ""In the end we were ragged, made bad decisions, the accuracy of our passing was poor all day and as a consequence we got picked off very easily. ""All credit to Swansea, they played exceptionally well and they took their chances when they came."" The two promoted sides in action today, Reading and West Ham, both enjoyed a promising start to the season. West Ham ran out 1-0 winners over Aston Villa with a controversial goal from captain Kevin Nolan. Aston Villa believed play had stopped due to an offside flag, allowing Nolan to easily score. ""Some of the play, I was really happy with and some, like anything, you're not. But I can't fault the lads for effort. Their effort was excellent,"" explained Villa manager Paul Lambert to the club website. ""We tried, but there wasn't much in the game. I thought we looked bright but we've got to turn our possession into chances. If we can just get a finishing touch on that then we'll be okay."" Reading looked like they were going to mark their return to the Premier League with a 1-0 home defeat to Stoke City. However, a last minute penalty from Adam Le Fondre rescued a point for last season's Championship winners. ""I think it would have been unjust if we'd lost but injustices are no good to anyone, you have to get results and we've done that. We wanted to win it after we got to 1-1,"" Reading Manager Brian McDermott told Reading's website after the game. Stoke had been fortunate to take the lead when a speculative shot from new signing Michael Kightly slipped through Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici's hands and into the net. ""I am so pleased he scored today. We had wide players who didn't really score last season but Kights has come in and put pressure on them from the word go which is what we want,"" Stoke manager Tony Pulis told his club's website. ""We need forward to score goals and for us our wide players are forwards. The extra competition can only help us this season."" Fulham joined Swansea at the top of the table with a dominating 5-0 win over Norwich. The London side's preparations have been overshadowed by the transfer rumors swirling around star player Clint Dempsey, but it was the club's new signing that stole the headlines on the opening day of the season. Mladen Petric scored two goals on his full debut, with Damien Duff, Steve Sidwell and Alex Kacaniklic picking up a goal each. ""I am very happy. Not only because of my performance, but because we had an amazing start today which will be very important for us throughout the rest of the season,"" Petric told the Fulham website. ""All of us played a very good game; we defended very well -- I think they had just one or two chances to score -- and we scored five goals which means that we played very well today."" Norwich City were playing their first game under new manager Chris Hughton, but struggled to replicate some of their impressive form from last season. ""You have to remember that it's the first game of the season, we've all been there before,"" said Hughton. ""Whether it's at the start of the season the middle or at the end defeats are defeats and you have to be able to bounce back from them and learn from them."" In the late kick off, Newcastle needed a late penalty to overcome a spirited display from Andre Villas-Boas' Tottenham side. The Portuguese manager was taking charge of the London team for the first time in a competitive match, and looked to have secured a valuable point when Jermain Defoe equalized Demba Ba's early second half strike. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew could face Football Association charges after he was sent to the stands for shoving the assistant referee.","Liverpool lose 3-0 to WBA, Arsenal only draw with Sunderland .

"London (CNN) -- Standard Chartered, a British banking giant, has paid $340 million to settle allegations it was involved in money laundering for Iranian clients. The settlement was reached with the New York State Department of Financial Services Tuesday, before a hearing due Wednesday. The hearing has now been adjourned. Standard Chartered -- which faced the loss of its U.S. banking license alongside fines for alleged breaches -- had pre-tax earnings of $6.76 billion in 2011, and the fine is ""easily manageable,"" according to a note by analyst Michael Symonds of Daiwa Capital Markets. Banks: Too big to prosecute? ""Reaching an early settlement means that StanChart avoids the potentially awkward hearing with the NYDFS.... and, critically, eliminates the immediate risk that the bank could lose its New York banking licence,"" Symonds said. However, investigations into the bank by other authorities including the Department of Justice and the Office of Foreign Assets Control continue, and ""this lone settlement does not draw a line through the matter,"" Symonds said. A statement from Standard Chartered said, ""a formal agreement containing the detailed terms of the settlement is expected to be concluded shortly."" The group added that it ""continues to engage constructively with the other relevant U.S. authorities."" What was Standard Chartered accused of? Standard Chartered was accused of helping Iran avoid American sanctions by concealing $250 billion worth of transactions over nearly 10 years, according to banking regulators in New York. More: Culture shift needed in banking? The New York State Department of Financial Services accused the London-based banking group of concealing 60,000 transactions with Iranian clients, including the Central Bank of Iran, from 2001 to 2010. The department says there is also evidence of similar schemes to conduct business with other U.S.-sanctioned countries such as Libya, Myanmar and Sudan. Why are there sanctions in place? The U.S. and its allies have increased economic sanctions against Iran during the past few years in an effort to deter the Islamic Republic from developing its nuclear capabilities. Iran has argued that its goal is to produce energy and medical isotopes, but U.S. officials say the Iranians are developing weapons. More: Age of irresponsibility in banks? Standard Chartered allegedly falsified business and official records to mask transactions with Iranian customers that were subject to U.S. economic sanctions, the New York State Department of Financial Services said. In exchange, the global banking group reaped ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars in fees, according to an order issued by the New York authorities. The regulators said the bank's actions left ""the U.S. financial system vulnerable to terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt regimes, and deprived law enforcement investigators of crucial information used to track all manner of criminal activity."" How was Standard Chartered alleged to have violated the rules? The regulators said Standard Chartered had a well-established policy to ""repair"" documents in so-called U-Turn transactions, in which offshore money passes through the U.S. financial system on its way to other offshore accounts. Under federal law, banks are obligated to ensure that such transactions do not violate U.S. sanctions. But regulators say Standard Chartered's New York branch regularly manipulated wire transfers that would have identified Iranian customers in the U-Turn transactions. More: Banking ethics ""in question"" According to the order, an official in the bank's U.S. division warned top bank managers in London in 2006 that the bank could face ""serious criminal liability,"" according to internal emails. How was the warning received? The warning was allegedly rejected by the recipient, who regulators say responded by writing in an email: ""You f-ing Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we are not going to deal with Iranians. [sic] "" According to the regulators, Standard Chartered's most senior management, ""designed and implemented an elaborate scheme by which to use its New York branch as a front for prohibited dealings with Iran -- dealings that indisputably helped sustain a global threat to peace and stability."" The regulator had ordered executives of Standard Chartered -- which it says was operating as a ""rogue institution"" -- to appear in New York Wednesday to answer the charges. How did Standard Chartered respond to the allegations? Standard Chartered refuted the charges, saying ""well over 99.9%"" of the referenced transactions complied with U.S. regulations. It said it strongly rejected the position and portrayal of facts made by the U.S. regulator. The statement said the group had approached U.S. agencies in January 2010 and informed them they had initiated a review of historic U.S. dollar transactions and compliance with U.S. sanctions. It said the ""group does not believe the order issued by the DFS presents a full and accurate picture of the facts,"" and ""Standard Chartered ceased all new business with Iranian customers in any currency over five years ago."" How much will this damage Standard Chartered? The large fine was expected and, as Symonds pointed out, is unlikely to significantly dent the bank's balance sheet. However, pressure has come down on chief executive Peter Sands, who flew to New York City to deal with the allegations. Sands has been at the bank's helm since 2006 following four years as group finance director. David Marshall, senior bank analyst at CreditSights, said in a note the fine was a ""little underwhelming"" given the strength of the original charges. The bank has been ""tarred"" but immediate regulatory pressure will be ""relieved for now,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean corporates will withdraw their business, but they will likely ask more questions,"" he added. Standard Chartered shares rallied on news of the U.S. settlement.","Standard Chartered pays $340M to settle allegations of money laundering for Iran .

"(CNN) -- Since 2008, Richard St. Denis and his nonprofit, World Access Project, have provided hundreds of wheelchairs and mobility aids to people living with disabilities in rural Mexico. St. Denis and his group also teach recipients how to use their chairs and maximize their quality of life. CNN asked St. Denis for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. CNN: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero? Richard St. Denis: I was at home in Santiago Casandeje, Mexico. I was completely surprised. I am honored to be one of the Top 10. The door has been opened to show the world the huge need for wheelchairs in Mexico, the plight of those who are stuck in their house because they can't move, and all the lives we are changing. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to the World Access Project? St. Denis: I hope that many people and organizations will come alongside of World Access Project to help provide mobility and a better quality of life to the many disabled of Mexico. ... I hope that people will realize that poverty is poverty and (that) those who have so much (should) help those in desperate need, in whatever country. I hope new volunteers, individuals or organizations -- from schools, churches -- will come to Mexico to give away a wheelchair, to encourage, to inspire and to change a life. I started this organization because I saw the happiness, joy and ability of Leti, a 17-year-old girl who I gave her first wheelchair. When American volunteers participate in a wheelchair donation, they realize the huge difference they can make in another person's life and the unexplainable feeling of watching someone get up off the floor into their first wheelchair. The one who receives the wheelchair laughs, and the mother cries tears of joy. I hope that not a single used wheelchair in the U.S. will ever be thrown into a dump and that every wheelchair that is sitting in a garage or basement will now be given to someone who desperately needs it. I hope this award means we will be able to provide a new life and opportunities to all those in Mexico who deserve to be as independent and successful as people with disabilities in the U.S. CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero? St. Denis: Every penny will go to World Access Project to continue the work we're doing. In the past couple months, our financial levels have been dropping, and I was wondering if we would last another year. We have new cities we want to go to, and there are thousands of people in Mexico who need wheelchairs. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? St. Denis: In many rural, impoverished, uneducated areas of Mexico, people don't even know what a wheelchair is. They don't know what their disability is or why they can't walk. They have no hope, no expectation for the future, and no resources to change their situation. ... We host clinics and camps to teach them how to use their wheelchairs so they can get out of their house. We use able and disabled volunteers to encourage them and give them hope. The Mexican government is trying to help, but doesn't have the financial resources or connections in remote areas to contact or help everyone. Many people in tiny pueblos have no electricity, dirt floors and cook using a wood stove. For a person with a disability to have a wheelchair is an unthought-of luxury. I have seen the lives of many people changed after receiving a wheelchair. Kike, who fell out of a tree when he was 12, is now an artist and helps support his family. TomÃ¡s was in a car accident, is now married, works in Walmart and has been promoted from greeter to the electronics department. Leti is married and has two children. (With) a wheelchair, some motivation, a new perspective, love -- a new life is created. No degree, no training, no qualification is necessary. Just a willingness to provide mobility, motivate and encourage are all that is needed to help someone get to where they never imagined they could be.

"(CNN) -- Creating a viral ad isn't as easy as grilling spicy chicken, but restaurant chain Nando's seems to have found the recipe for success. The South African group, which has hundreds of branches in some 30 countries, hit the headlines again in late November with an advert portraying Zimbabwe's notorious president Robert Mugabe cavorting with five fellow dictators. The ""Last Standing Dictator"" ad uses look-alike actors to show Mugabe reminiscing merrier times with former iron-fist rulers that are now deceased, including Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Uganda's Idi Amin. To the nostalgic sounds of ""Those Were the Days"" by Mary Hopkin, Mugabe remembers enjoying a water-fight with Gadhafi -- in which the Libyan former leader holds a trademark golden machine gun -- as well as re-enacting with Amin the famous romantic scene of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio's from ""Titanic"" on the back of an army vehicle. The amusing advert captured the imagination of millions, says Quinton Cronje, managing director of Nando's. ""It was bigger than we ever anticipated,"" he says. ""The whole thing of dictators over the year of 2011 was a global concept so it went really big -- bigger than any other ad in Africa has ever done virally."" The advert might got a huge reaction but the response in Zimbabwe wasn't so funny -- the restaurant chain had to pull the ad after staff in the country were threatened by Mugabe loyalists. Zimbabwe open for business, says finance minister . Nando's, famous for its piri-piri chicken, has a long history of testing boundaries with its advertising campaigns, which are often inspired by recent news events. Its radical approach has become integral to the development of the brand, says Cronje. ""Chicken is a commodity and we sex chicken up by talking about the brand intrinsics and we have always been about having an advertising strategy that is cutting edge.

""We like to pick things that are -- people use the word controversy -- I don't say controversy, I'd say things that generate healthy debate,"" he adds. Other adverts by the brand that created a stir include its campaign for the South Africa-held football World Cup in 2010 -- the company's entire promotional activity for the landmark event dealt in a humorous way with misconceptions that foreigners might have of South Africa, such as overseas visitors believing that ""all South African men have more than one wife"" or that ""all African women walk around bare-breasted all the time."" Bin Laden bread a hit for Malawi bakers . ""We were having an influx of foreigners visiting South Africa and we needed comment on it and we did it in a way that demonstrates the ignorance and the misconceptions that people have about our country,"" says Ahmed Tilly, executive creative director at Nando's advertising agency. ""It touched South Africans because they've traveled and they've been asked the question, 'do you have electricity in Africa, are there animals roaming the streets in Africa.' And we took that insight and basically made a campaign that was relevant to the World Cup,"" adds Tilly. Ivory Coast seeks chocolate fairness for farmers . While the brand has not shied away from dealing with heated issues such as race and gender stereotypes in its campaigns, Tilly says that there are still some subjects that the company will not go anywhere near in its adverts. ""We try to stay away from religion as far as possible, only because it is so sensitive and it is not a defendable topic,"" he says. Religion may be out of bounds for Nando's but the recent death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il sparked an immediate branding opportunity for the company. ""When we heard that Kim in North Korea had died we generated a viral commercial that we got up in less than one hour and it was really to say, 'North Korea, it wasn't us. We are in to eradicating hunger rather than eradicating dictators,'"" says Cronje. This wasn't the first time the chain was quick enough to react in order to benefit from a major news event. And from the looks of it, it won't be the last. Tilly says that pushing boundaries is becoming more and more important in today's highly-competitive advertising environment. ""I think all brands need to go there otherwise they are getting lost,"" he says.","Restaurant chain Nando's is famous for testing boundaries with its advertising .
Its campaigns deal with politics, race and gender stereotypes in an amusing way .

"(CNN) -- For a woman whose country is on the brink of financial collapse, Greek teacher Julie Koukliati is surprisingly cheerful. ""You only hear bad things about Europe and Greece but people there still have hope,"" she said. ""They are still falling in love, going on vacation, they are getting on with their lives."" Koukliati is quick to add, however, that many of her friends and family are inquiring about South Africa, where three weeks ago she started a new job teaching Greek at a private school in the city of Pretoria. Koukliati is in South Africa as part of an initiative by the education ministry in her country to teach the Greek language to expats living abroad. However, the program has been drastically reduced as Greece tries to cut back on spending. Over 2,000 teachers were sent overseas in 2009, and last year the number was cut down to 1,430. The teachers pay for their own travel and relocation but continue to receive a salary from the Greek government. Teachers' salaries have recently been cut by the Greek government, and Koukliati says she now earns 200 euros less than she did two years ago. She's expecting another cut soon as her government explores more ways of saving money. Working in South Africa, however, will cushion that blow. ""The truth is I get two salaries now,"" she told CNN. ""One from Greece and one from here."" Apart from the primary school where she goes in the morning, Koukliati teaches older kids at a Greek community center. She told CNN: ""The community here asked the ministry of education back home to take care of this part of Greece which is in South Africa, and it's a strong part."" Up to 50,000 Greeks live in South Africa, according to the Consulate General of Greece in Johannesburg. Community organizations have told CNN that they are receiving more job applications from electricians and artists desperate to escape the tough economic conditions in Greece. When asked how she feels about the fact Greek teachers are losing their jobs back home while she is paid to teach foreigners, Koukliati insists she's still serving her country. She said of her students: ""Their roots are in Greece. Their parents and grandparents don't want them to lose their roots. In their hearts and their parents' hearts Greece is always there. So I'm still working for Greece, that's for sure."" The number of Greeks living in South Africa has dropped sharply in the past decade. A report by the General Secretariat of Greeks abroad estimated that 100,000 expats lived in South Africa in 2004 -- roughly twice the number living there today. South Africa has its own unemployment problems, but a deficit in specialized skills could see the once dwindling Greek community burgeon again.","Greek teachers are finding work teaching the Greek language in South Africa .

"(CNN) -- Alistair Brownlee claimed Britain's first ever medal in the men's Olympic triathlon, taking gold ahead of two-time world champion Javier Gomez and his brother Jonny, who won bronze despite incurring a 15 second penalty. It marked Team GB's 19th gold medal of the London Games, matching the number they landed in Beijing four years ago. The elder of the two brothers, Alistair, recovered from months out with injury to take his first Olympic gold medal in a grueling event that comprises a 1.5km swim, 43km bike ride and a 10km run. The 24-year-old clocked a time of one hour 45 minutes and 23 seconds to edge out Gomez and could afford to grab a Union Jack flag from the crowd and canter through the final 100 meters. Jonny, 22, had to receive medical treatment after the race but showed guts and determination to take third after being penalized for mounting his bike too soon after the swim. All the action from day eleven with our London 2012 live blog . Alistair's triumph was soon followed by another as Laura Bechtolsheimer, Carl Hester and Charlotte Dujardin helped Britain win the team dressage event in Greenwich Park. ""It feels a bit underwhelming in a way because Jonny has collapsed and he's not feeling too good,"" Alistair told the host broadcaster after the race. ""That race was just unbelievable. I felt in control right from the start. And the crowds, I don't think I've ever come across anything anywhere near like that and I doubt I ever will again. ""My ears are still ringing with the noise. It was absolutely amazing. I'm massively proud. It's been talked about so much that Great Britain haven't won a triathlon medal so the pressure was stacked up. ""To get two of us, two British brothers, on the podium -- you couldn't ask for any more."" Both brothers finished the end of the swimming leg in the leading pack but Jonny was handed a penalty for mounting his bike too early after leaving Hyde Park's Serpentine lake. At the end of the 43km bike stage both were at the front as British teammate Stuart Hayes played the role of pace setter. Alistair moved away from the field in the early stages of the 10km run, allowing Jonny to leave enough of a cushion to serve his 15 second penalty and rejoin the race clear in third. The elder brother ended with a time of 29 minutes and seven seconds in the 10km run -- just over a minute and a half slower than compatriot Mo Farah who won the 10,000 meters on Saturday. Alsatair said he had purposely ran a fast opening lap to give his brother the best chance to win a medal. He added: ""We knew he had a penalty early in the bike and I was telling him 'Calm down, you can still easily get on the podium with a 15 second penalty.' ""I took the first lap of the run out really hard to try and get Jonny as far away from the others as I could. Gomez was having a great race again today so there was not much we could do about that. ""Jonny is fine, triathlon is a tough sport and we've both been in that position. I think it was deceptively hard today, obviously it was fast but with this humid, muggy day, it dehydrates you and he was right on the edge at the finish.""","Alistair Brownlee wins gold in the men's triathlon at the London Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Every sports fan has daydreamed about what it would be like to own their hometown team. For the vast majority of enthusiasts it is a far-fetched, and unaffordable, fantasy. But if you are one of the world's wealthiest golf stars, it is an investment you can seriously consider. And it would seem four-time major winner Phil Mickelson is pondering such a purchase, after the California native revealed he is part of a group considering a bid for the San Diego Padres Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. ""I've had the opportunity to invest in other sports franchises, and I've turned it down in the past,"" the 41-year-old told the San Diego Union-Tribune website. Donald wins to return back to the top of the world rankings . ""This was a unique opportunity with families that had done this before and know how to do it right and want to get involved in the community."" Mickelson, who was born in San Diego, is the second-highest earner on the PGA Tour, having amassed winnings of $66 million since turning pro in 1992. According to the financial magazine Forbes, the three-time Masters champion pocketed $48 million in winnings, endorsement and other income between May 2011 and May 2012 -- making him the sixth highest earner in sport. Over the eight years Forbes has been compiling the list, it is estimated Mickelson has earned $378 million. Mickelson, who is part of a group of potential investors which includes four grandchildren of former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley, revealed he would be putting ""a lot"" of his own money into the deal. ""Given the price tag,"" said Mickelson, ""it's a significant amount."" The size of the offer is not known, but the Dodgers were sold for $2.1 billion last month to a group including former basketball superstar Magic Johnson. ""When we met with Phil we were inspired by his commitment to San Diego and his passion for the Padres,"" Kevin O'Malley, one of the other potential investors, said in a prepared statement released to the PGA Tour's website. ""He is a world-class person, athlete and businessman with a strong history of charitable leadership and he will be an ideal partner for many years in San Diego.""","Phil Mickelson is considering an investment in the San Diego Padres .

"(CNN) -- Golfers dream of winning their first major title -- it brings not only money, fame and a place in the history books, but also the confidence that more success will follow. David Duval, however, might disagree. Back in 2001, the American was celebrating his first major championship, delivering an unexpectedly emotional speech at Royal Lytham & St. Annes after his breakthrough win at the British Open. However, he's still waiting for his next top-level victory, having fallen from the summit of the world rankings to 750th this season after making the halfway cut in just two of 12 starts on the PGA Tour. His last win of any kind was on his 30th birthday at a Japan Tour event in November 2001. It's grim reading for a man who once shot the holy grail of 59, who has won 13 times on the U.S. circuit and is 40th in the PGA Tour's all-time standings with tournament earnings of almost $19 million. ""Well, a lot of it really comes from injury, when you're fighting a nagging back injury,"" he told CNN's Living Golf show ahead of this week's return to the English course where he entered his name alongside those of golfing greats. ""It's still a problem. It's been 12 years now, started before that year, started in 2000, I've had tendonitis in my shoulders, my wrists, had some knee problems. ""As a professional golfer you get used to playing with some aches and pains, but when you're playing with aches and pains that impede what you're trying to do it becomes that much more difficult and it can wreck form. ""And my form was wrecked -- you start hitting the ball crooked and your confidence gets wrecked."" Against all odds . Despite his long wait for another victory, Duval still holds out hope that he can again lift a trophy. He will make history if he does succeed at Royal Lytham -- the longest gap between British Open victories is 11 years, when Henry Cotton won his second title in 1937 and third in 48. For those not affected by World War II, when no tournaments were played, the mark is nine years -- most recently achieved by Gary Player (1959-1968). ""I still have it in me. It hasn't always lined up as often as it did 10 years ago, but that comes when you lose a bit of confidence -- you get hurt, and it's hard to stay on that path,"" Duval said. ""I've put in the time, I've put in the effort. I still have the desire, so I think it could be another great week for me."" Turning back time . Duval rolled back the years when he tied for second at the 2009 U.S. Open, but he has not made the cut at the British major since tying for 39th the previous year. ""I've been working very hard and I feel good about what I've been doing and I feel good about my chances at Lytham this year,"" the 40-year-old said. ""I'm really looking forward to getting there and playing, and there's no reason I can't start over where I got started."" Duval won by three shots in 2001, and stunned the gallery when he took off his trademark sunglasses and cap to make a heartfelt victory speech. ""It just came to me. I'd been playing (the British Open) since '95, and this year will be my 16th. My first experience over there at the Scottish Open at Carnoustie before the '95 Open at St. Andrews was a real eye-opener for me,"" he recalled. ""The galleries seemed to be that much more knowledgeable about the game, about the difficulty of shots you were facing, and I just kind of took it all in. ""Just because I wore a hat down low with sunglasses doesn't mean I can't be a nice person, you know I do it for a reason, and I just took them off, had an opportunity to and talked -- and it really did hit me just some of the experiences I'd had over the years there."" Future's so bright, gotta wear shades . No matter the gloomy British weather, expect to see Duval back in shades and hat for the July 19-22 tournament in Lancashire. ""For some reason my eyes seem very sensitive to the light, and I always felt that it's easier to play golf like this than with your eyes squinting, to have them open all the way,"" he said. ""I wear contacts when I play. In college I kept getting a lot of dust and pollen in my eyes -- it was an issue and I was the only one to wear contacts -- and that was the impetus to put on a pair of sunglasses."" Duval expects Lytham's bunker-filled fairways to again pose a major test for the world's top golfers. ""I don't think it has kind of the reputation or fame of some of the other venues they have -- I'm not quite sure why,"" he said. ""The year I won I shot 10 under par and won by three strokes, and we had pretty nice weather, and I think that goes to the strength, the difficulty and the challenge of the golf course. You really do have to place the golf ball around. ""You have to go around the golf course like that, knowing what you're trying to do, knowing why you're trying to do that, and stick to it.""","Former world No. 1 David Duval will return to the scene of his only major triumph .

"(CNN) -- Investing in climate change initiatives can be a business opportunity for companies, according to the deputy chief executive of Pan-African banking giant Standard Bank. ""It makes perfect commercial sense,"" Sim Tshabalala told CNN's Robyn Curnow on the sidelines of the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa. ""Sustainability is important in the long term."" Negotiators from 195 countries descended on Durban last week to discuss climate change and find ways to finance efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. Tshabalala said it's important that governments take the lead on policy issues and called business people to follow suit in partnership with other organs of the society. ""We, as bankers, will take direction from the authorities on what happens at COP 17, we stand ready to be supportive,"" he said. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: Why does it make sense for business to be leading the way perhaps when it comes to issues about climate change? Sim Tshabalala: I think even for business, sustainability is important in the long term, it's important because we all want to do something about environmental degradation, acting astute in financial institutions for example. We want to leave our businesses in better shape than we found them for future generations but, broader than that, it's also a business opportunity because of the various mechanisms that apply. CNN: So it need not be a drain on finance --investing in climate change initiatives can make money. ST: It makes perfect commercial sense. CNN: Why? Give me some examples. ST: So, here in South Africa, we've just been through a major program: the first part of a process in terms of which the government is allowing independent power producers to enter the grid. We have approved over 12 billion rands worth of these projects, we're participating in at least half of them. Now they may not be granted, they may not be approved by the authorities, but there's a large number of them where we're participating. We perceive this as a new asset class, consistent with sustainability. CNN: Sometimes there's a sense that if this is going to work, it's going to be very bottom up. The politicians can go on talking and trying to agree on targets but it's people on the ground, it's businesses, that are quietly doing their own thing, and you're helping perhaps to facilitate that. ST: Frankly, the legitimate democratically-elected government must take the lead on policy, and business as an organ of society, together with other organs of society, must follow and do what they need to do, having regard to what they do for a living. We, as bankers, will take direction from the authorities on what happens at COP 17, we stand ready to be supportive, we support the white paper on climate change in South Africa. So my argument to you is, yes it's important for the authorities to take the lead, business as organs of civil society must do what they need to do in buying and selling their products and they must act in consent and in partnership with society, but wanting to make money in the process -- we're not a charity, we're a business after all. CNN: This is the end of the year, looking back, what have been the biggest challenges for you? ST: The big challenges have been, as a banker, a difficulty in lending out money, because both corporate and consumers have been de-leveraging, they've been borrowing less than we would like them to. The result of that for a bank is that we don't make as much net interest income, we don't generate as much revenues as we would have liked to. People are buying and selling fewer goods, so transactions and fees and commissions as a consequence are less. And yet, we've got thousands of people that we employ -- we employ over 50,000 people throughout the world -- the bulk of which are on the African continent, they have to be paid regardless of whether you and I transact.","Sim Tshabalala is group deputy chief executive officer of Standard Bank .

"(CNN) -- Wacho Yayo and his wife Dawe are used to seeing the plants shrivel around them, the earth crack and their cattle die. Every time a drought has hit this elderly couple's village in northern Kenya they have had to rebuild their lives all over again. ""The last drought was bad,"" 69-year-old Wacho says. ""During the drought time there wasn't even any water to drink. There was no food. The animals had nothing to eat. And there was only dust blowing. I felt very bad and I was very bitter. I wanted to run away but there was nowhere to run."" The searing heat spread across the Horn of Africa last June, destroying livestock, ruining lives and decimating entire communities. When the heavy rain clouds eventually arrived in northern Kenya the people in the Darche village, near the town of Marsabit, came out of their homes and danced. 'We couldn't even eat the seeds': Drought affecting millions . By then Wacho and Dawe had lost 10 of their 15 cows, but they danced too. They knew they would struggle to support their nine children without these animals but this drought was different -- for the first time in their lives Wacho had taken insurance out on some of their cattle. Shortly before the first leaf wilted from the heat, an insurance promoter had come to their small village offering livestock insurance. It was a new initiative that has been trialed in this part of Kenya. Wacho was skeptical -- he'd never heard of insurance and he wasn't sure that he would ever see his money again. After talking it through with Dawe he eventually decided to sign up and pay a premium for a few of his cows -- he couldn't afford to cover them all. ""This insurance is good,"" he says, sitting on a stool outside his home, his surviving cattle listlessly tied up behind him. Once the rains came 650 herders eventually received compensation for the loss of thousands of animals. Wacho and Dawe did not get enough to buy new cows but they did manage to buy some goats. This initiative is run by the Nairobi-based organization, the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI). It is one of a growing number of micro-insurance schemes being rolled out in Africa. Backed by British and U.S. government development departments and the World Bank, there are plans to expand this project across northern Kenya and into southern Ethiopia. Some farmers chose not to join the insurance initiative. Others could not afford the premiums. Siko Hirdo lives just across the mud track from Wacho and Dawe. Like Wacho he relies on his cows to support his family but when the insurance man came to visit Siko decided to prioritize paying the school fees. He lost 11 of his cows and has struggled to support his 11 children ever since. ""We were faced with a severe drought and we had a lot of problems,"" he says. ""Now we know the importance and value of insurance. I am now ready to insure my livestock."" Elephants and livestock battle for water in East Africa . When drought hits such remote and vast areas it is impossible to count all the dead animals, so this initiative uses satellite images to quantify the loss of foliage in each area. This then determines who should be compensated and by how much. One of the biggest challenges of introducing insurance in remote rural villages is the lack of knowledge and understanding. This is where insurance promoters like Edin Ibrahim come in. As a farmer himself Ibrahim knows all about being ravaged by drought. ""Over 80%of our population are illiterates. Understanding this insurance issue was just too hard,"" he explains. ""But with the time and with the information in the language they understand and the values and importance, now they are getting it and catching up."" ""Micro-insurance for agriculture is something that farmers in the rest of the world have had access to for sometime,"" says Challiss McDonough from the World Food Programme. ""African farmers, the poorest and smallest scale farmers are only just beginning to have access to and their ability to do that can really help the agriculture sector to grow and become more productive."" WFP and Oxfam America have their own micro-insurance initiative for agriculture in Ethiopia and it's now being expanded into Senegal. McDonough warns that insurance by itself isn't a magic bullet so it's important to combine insurance with other forms of risk management, including access to credit and savings. Nearly 400 million people in Africa live below the poverty line, and most of them depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, so vulnerability to climate-related shocks is a constant threat to their food security and well-being, the WFP warns. Kenya's Turkana people facing climate catastrophe . Back in Darche, Fatuma Galgallo stands out with her small frame consumed by a large Christmas jumper. Unlike Wacho, Dawe and Siko, she has chosen not to restock her herd. ""I am very bitter about the drought,"" she says. ""I was about to die of hunger and I lost all of my livestock, I had no shelter and no husband. I had a lot of animals but I only bought insurance for two cows and I had to borrow money to afford it. Now all our animals are dead."" Her cattle were insured but she has had enough of drought and, from the look on her face it's clear she has had enough of struggling. She was compensated but she used the money to build herself a mud-walled, corrugated iron-roofed home instead. It's small but she is clearly proud of it and her neat little garden at the front. Across from Fatuma's new home someone else's animals feast on the lush green grass. The rains are here now but further down the hill the new foliage covers the bones of the animals who did not make it. Wache Yayo's memories of drought may fade but, like these bones, they will never disappear. If his years have taught him anything it's that insurance or not, drought will happen once again in this climate of extremes.","Vulnerable communities across the Horn of Africa have long been scarred by drought .
Insurance is becoming an important way of protecting and compensating those affected .
Nearly 400 million people in Africa live below the poverty line, and depend on agriculture .

"London (CNN) -- Julian Assange demanded that the United States drop its ""witch hunt"" against WikiLeaks on Sunday as he made his first public appearance after months effectively confined to the Embassy of Ecuador in London. ""As WikiLeaks stands under threat, so does the freedom of expression and the health of all our societies,"" the founder of website said to cheers from his supporters outside the embassy. ""The U.S. war on whistle-blowers must end,"" Assange said, calling for the freedom of Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier suspected of giving hundreds of thousands of pages of secret American government documents to Assange for publication on WikiLeaks. Assange also referred to The New York Times, the Bahraini activist Nabeel Rajab and the Russian feminist punk band Pussy Riot in his 10-minute appearance. The founder of WikiLeaks spoke from a balcony at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, where he has been holed up since June. Correa defends Assange asylum decision . His lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, called earlier for him to be given safe passage to Ecuador from Britain. ""Mr. Assange is going to continue fighting for his rights,"" Garzon declared, saying that Assange had instructed his legal team to take action. Garzon, an attorney from Spain who is best known from his years as a crusading judge, did not say what that legal action would be. Garzon was barred from the Spanish bench earlier this year for authorizing the wire-tapping of corruption suspects speaking to their lawyers. Assange fled to the embassy avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning about alleged sex crimes. Sunday marks two months since Assange fled to the embassy. Monday marks two years since Swedish prosecutors first issued a warrant for his arrest, alleging that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. Assange has been effectively confined for the past two months to the diplomatic mission -- a suite of rooms covering half of one floor of a townhouse in a posh London neighborhood south of Hyde Park. Ecuador raised the stakes in its diplomatic row with the United Kingdom on Thursday, officially offering Assange asylum in the South American country. The British say they will not give him safe passage out of the embassy. The Foreign Office says Britain has a legal obligation to hand him over to Sweden, after Assange's legal efforts to avoid extradition were rejected by British courts up to the Supreme Court. Garzon said that Assange was willing to answer Swedish prosecutors' questions, but only if he is given certain guarantees. Assange, an Australian, and his supporters claim a U.S. grand jury has been empaneled to consider charges against him. Assange claims to fear Sweden will transfer him in turn to the United States, where he could face the death penalty for the work of WikiLeaks. Sweden angrily rejected the allegation on Thursday. ""Sweden does not extradite individuals who risk facing the death penalty,"" the Foreign Ministry said after Ecuador granted Assange asylum. Assange and diplomatic asylum: A primer . Assange says the allegations in Sweden are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website, which facilitates the publication of secret documents. He has published hundreds of thousands of pages of American government diplomatic cables and assessments of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. His expected appearance came as foreign ministers from various South American countries gathered in Ecuador to discuss his fate. The dispute between Britain and Ecuador exploded when the British Foreign Office, in a letter to Ecuadorian officials, cited a little known law that could temporarily suspend the embassy's diplomatic protection and allow authorities to enter and arrest Assange. President Rafael Correa on Saturday slammed Britain's behavior toward Ecuador, describing it as ""intolerable"" and ""unacceptable."" ""Who do they think they're dealing with?"" Correa asked rhetorically during his weekly address. ""They don't realize Latin America is free and sovereign. We won't tolerate interference, colonialism of any kind."" The president said Ecuador had asked for, but did not receive, guarantees that Assange would not be extradited to a third country. Correa has sought support on the issue from foreign ministers of the the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and the leftist Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA), who gathered in Guayaquil, Ecuador, this weekend. UNASUR backed Ecuador's decision to grant Assange asylum and called for more dialogue between Britain and Ecuador on the issue. It condemned the ""threat of the use of force"" and expressed its hope that the countries could arrive at a ""mutually acceptable solution."" ALBA, whose membership includes Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, warned Britain on Saturday against raiding the embassy. ""We warn the government of the United Kingdom that it will face grave consequences around the world if it directly breaches the territorial integrity of the Embassy of the Republic of Ecuador in London,"" according to a statement read by Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro on behalf of ALBA nations.

""All of our previous engagements and bands we were in before this sort of took breaks or ended around the same time,"" explains Z Berg, the only female in the quintet. ""We all kind of magically were able to make this a real band, which is cool."" Berg first gained notice as the 15-year-old vocalist of the girl group The Like. In JJAMZ, she trades off on lead vocals with Phantom Planet front man Alex Greenwald and solo artist Michael Runion. Drummer Jason Boesel, whose credits include Rilo Kiley and Bright Eyes, rounds out the band with guitarist Valentine. The five say they've been best friends for more than a decade. ""There's a lot of history in this band, and you just have to wonder what it is,"" Berg teases. ""It would be a really good 'Behind the Music' if we got into how entangled all of our lives are,"" Valentine says. ""It would be the best 'Behind the Music' ever.""

"(CNN) -- When Se Ri Pak won the U.S. Women's Open in 1998, she could not have imagined the impact it would have on the golfing world. Then 20 years old, and the only South Korean on the LPGA Tour, Pak won a titanic 20-hole playoff to claim her second major title in her rookie season. She had won the LPGA Championship earlier that year, but it was her success at Blackwolf Run that triggered a phenomenal boom in female golfing talent in both her home country and Asia in general. Four of the last five U.S. Women's Open champions have been from Korea, most recently Na Yeon Choi -- who on Sunday clinched her first major title with a four-shot victory over compatriot Amy Yang at the same course in Kohler, Wisconsin where Pak inspired so many dreams. ""That was 14 years ago. I was only 10 years old and when I was watching TV, my goal was ... my dream was like I just want to be there,"" Choi said on the LPGA website. ""And 14 years later I'm here right now, and I made it. My dream's come true. I really appreciate what Se Ri did and all the Korean players, what they did. It's really no way I can be here without them. ""I really wish like 14 years later from now some junior golfer or some young Korean golfer says, 'I was watching on TV how Na Yeon was playing 14 years ago and that inspired me."" Feng aims to be 'the Li Na of golf' after historic LPGA win . Pak was there to congratulate Choi, having overcome shoulder problems to take her place in the starting field -- 29 of which were Korean. The five-time major winner wrapped up a round of one-under 71, which was good enough for a tie for ninth, as Choi was playing at the adjacent ninth hole. ""I'm trying to give her a little look back, but I don't want her to lose her focus, so I'm trying to not give her a look,"" Pak said. ""But you know, she's already been there many times. She won five times (on the LPGA Tour) already, and of course, this is a little different than a regular event, but she's good enough to be out there, she hung in there."" Choi needed to hold her nerve after a triple-bogey at the 10th cut her lead to two shots, and responded with an immediate birdie before a 20-foot par-saving putt at 12 and some lucky bounces off rocks to avoid the water hazard at 13. ""That moment (the triple-bogey) maybe I thought I might screw up today, but I thought I needed to fix that. I can do it,"" Choi said. ""So I tried to think what I have to do. So I started to talk with my caddie about just like what airplane tomorrow, or about the car or about the vacation. Not golf."" From military kid to major champion: Creamer's salute to U.S. soldiers . The top 10 featured just three American players, as 2010 winner Paula Creamer tied for seventh with Japan's Mika Miyazoto while 2007 champion Cristie Kerr and Nicole Castrale were alongside Pak on four over for the tournament. Germany's Sandra Gal claimed third ahead of South Korea's Ilhee Lee, LPGA Championship winner Shanshan Feng of China and Italy's Giulia Sergas in fourth equal. Defending champion So Yeon Ru of Korea was tied for 14th in a group including 17-year-old American Lexi Thompson, who was seeking to become the youngest winner of a major in either the men's or women's game. She had been tied for third after 54 holes, but closed with 78 -- a better closing round might have made her a winner 10 days younger than Tom Morris when he triumphed at the British Open in 1868. Former U.S. teen prodigy Michelle Wie faded from 13th going into the final round to a tie for 35th after carding 80. She was a shot ahead of a group including 15-year-old Korea-born New Zealander Lydia Ko, who was the top amateur in 39th equal. Ko became the youngest player to win a professional tournament in January when still 14.

"(CNN) -- The Army psychiatrist accused of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting told the military judge his Muslim faith requires him to wear a beard, marking the first time Maj. Nidal Hasan has made a statement in court. ""Your honor, in the name of almighty Allah, I am a Muslim,"" Hasan said. ""I believe that my religion requires me to wear a beard."" Hasan made the statement after the presiding judge, Col. Gregory Gross, asked why he was still in contempt of court -- in other words, why Hasan hadn't shaved his beard, which is against Army regulations. ""I am not trying to disrespect your authority as a military a judge. And I am not trying to disrupt the proceedings or the decorum of the court,"" he said. ""When I stand before God I am individually responsible for my actions."" Gross has threatened to have Hasan forcibly shaved, previously citing the regulations and the right to ensure ""that a military trial proceeds without a distracting and disruptive sideshow."" Hasan was found in contempt of court again Thursday, fined $1,000 and sent from the court to a trailer where Hasan watched the rest of the proceedings via closed circuit TV. A hearing has been scheduled for Thursday, September 6, to discuss whether Hasan's religious claims would prevent him from being shaved. Hasan's court martial was scheduled to start last week at Fort Hood, in Killeen, Texas, where he is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32. The trial was delayed when Hasan's legal team petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals to prevent Gross from ordering Hasan's facial hair shaved. The Court of Appeals found that Hasan's petition was ""premature"" because Gross had not yet issued a definitive order. If an official order was given, the appeals court said, Hasan could file another petition. The beard issue surfaced in June, when Hasan, who remains in the Army while awaiting trial, appeared at a hearing with the beard. Gross postponed that hearing, then found Hasan in contempt of court at a July hearing, fined him $1,000 and warned him he would be shaved by force unless he got rid of the beard. Hasan had been expected to enter a plea during a previous hearing, but the proceedings were halted by the appellate court. Hasan has previously expressed interest in pleading guilty, but military regulations bar a judge from accepting a guilty plea in a capital case. Hasan is accused of opening fire at the post's processing center, where soldiers were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan and Iraq, in November 2009. He faces a possible death sentence if convicted. He was paralyzed from the waist down in the shooting, when police officers exchanged fire with him. Hasan, a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997. He had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings, but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military. He is a Muslim who had told his family he had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Investigations that followed the killings found he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni-American radical cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011. An FBI report in July found that a Joint Terrorism Task Force in San Diego that was investigating al-Awlaki passed two of the messages to another task force in the Washington area, where Hasan was living at the time. The report found those e-mails should have been given to the Pentagon, but the FBI saw no evidence of terrorist activities in his case, and believed the information in the e-mails was too sensitive to share. It noted that visiting extremist websites is not grounds for taking action. FBI official: Hasan should have been interviewed on e-mails with radical cleric .","Maj.

"(CNN) -- Russian singer Evgeny Nikitin has pulled out of one of the world's best-known opera events, the Bayreuth Festival in Germany, because he has a Nazi tattoo, organizers said Sunday. Nikitin was in a heavy metal band as a young man, and got the swastika tattoo then, said festival spokesman Gunther Philipowski. ""That is a problem in Bayreuth,"" Philipowski said. ""Bayreuth has a bad history with the Nazis. It's clear that Bayreuth has to be careful about this terrible part of history and has to take a position against it."" The festival is dedicated to the works of Richard Wagner, one of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's favorite composers. Hitler attended the Bayreuth Festival regularly, according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia, which describes Wagner as ""an artist long associated with anti-Semitism"" and the racist-nationalist volkisch tradition ""from which the Nazis drew much of their ideology."" Nikitin, 38, a bass-baritone, has ""painted over"" his Nazi tattoo, and it would not have been visible during his performance in ""The Flying Dutchman,"" Philipowski said. But there are videos of him online where the tattoo is visible, he said. ""I had the tattoos made when I was young. It was a big mistake in my life and I wish I had never done it,"" Nikitin said in a statement released by the festival. Nikitin canceled his appearance after discussions with Bayreuth management, the spokesman said. He had already been in Germany rehearsing for his premiere on Wednesday, Philipowski said. Nikitin's agent did not immediately respond to CNN questions about the cancellation. His website still lists him as appearing in ""The Flying Dutchman"" at the festival this summer. The festival website does not list him in the cast.","Evgeny Nikitin was due to appear at the Bayreuth Festival this week .

"(CNN) -- Car giant BMW is shifting up a gear in its efforts to tap Africa's emerging middle class. Bodo Donauer, managing director of BMW South Africa, said the auto manufacturer sells one out of three premium cars in the country. He now wants the company to replicate the successful South African model in other parts of the continent. ""We clearly see that there is a growing middle class coming through in Africa and that there is a lot of interest in development and we assume that the middle class as we have seen it in South Africa is growing and there is purchasing power and there is a demand for our cars as well,"" he told CNN's Robyn Curnow. Last week, BMW unveiled plans to increase the production capacity at its Pretoria-based Rosslyn plant, the company's first production facility outside Germany, built in 1973. The move is expected to enable BMW to double its exports from the country -- Donauer says that 80% of the cars produced at the plant are exported to countries across the world. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: What is it about South Africa that you find good and what are the challenges of working in this country? Bodo Donauer: We are proud to have a plant here in South Africa which is a member of the BMW Group production network and we are proud that we are able to deliver the same quality. Certainly there are always challenges, there are challenges all around the whole world and if you talk in South Africa about challenges, it's a skills issue, it's the supplier base, it's education of the people, it's logistics and everything but so far we were able to deal with this and to overcome this and we have a successful future ahead as we are planning to double the production volume in this plant. CNN: Logistics -- getting the cars out -- how difficult is it, particularly with a port like Durban for example? See also: Long delays at Africa's busiest port . BD: It's a challenge, especially if you're talking about the Durban port, if you have the lowest efficiency and the highest prices for your port operation it's not a good position to be in. So, South Africa needs to change this and there have been measures taken at least to talk about and to bring it forward. We need efficient ports but we just do not need Durban alone -- I would say we need in sub-Saharan Africa sufficient ports, we need to have one in Mozambique, maybe in Angola and we need to have an infrastructure which links these ports to each other -- it's all about proper infrastructure in order to get production volumes which are increasing out of the country to our customers.

BD: It is at least a weakness which we definitely have but in favor of South Africa's weakness [is that it] has been mentioned... (that) certain improvements will be done and I trust that this will come through. CNN: From your point of view, has this been one of the things that has kept you awake at night, how to get the cars of this country? BD: Yes, we have fantastic cars, we produce them with the right quality and we should have a very smooth process in a combination between transit and the port operation to get them out as quickly as possible and this is what we're working for. CNN: How has the euro crisis impacted the BMW Group globally? BD: We have not been affected directly, it's more a financial crisis than an industrial crisis. It's very important that we have a successful euro and from a German point of view -- talking for a German-based company with a lot of international operations -- it's very important, as we are a big exporter, to have a common currency. Read also: Underwater cables bring faster internet to West Africa . CNN: The cars built in BMW's South African plant are exported across the world. BD: The majority of the cars, 80 per cent to be exact, is exported around the world -- main markets are the NAFTA states, Japan, Australia, Korea, Hong Kong, all these kind of countries. CNN: And Africa? BD: We sell through the whole African continent, I think 33,000 or 35,000 cars, the majority of this certainly in South Africa at the moment. In South Africa we are clearly the leader in the premium car segment, one out of three premium cars is a BMW. Yes, it's different if we go north in Africa because we are not selling so many cars over there -- we have a huge market in Egypt and we have importers who sell our cars through Africa, but what we do now (is) we try to use the model which we have used in South Africa to increase our footprint. CNN: Why are you taking this decision now? BD: It's that we clearly see that there is a growing middle class coming through in Africa and that there is a lot of interest in development and we assume that the middle class as we have seen it in South Africa is growing and there is purchasing power and there is a demand for our cars as well.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Former Chicago gang member Jose Padilla was found guilty Thursday of supporting Islamic terrorism overseas. Jose Padilla was originally accused of planning a ""dirty bomb"" attack in the United States. Co-defendants Adham Hassoun and Kifan Jayyousi were also found guilty of the three counts charged: conspiracy to murder, kidnap, and maim people in a foreign country; conspiracy to provide material support for terrorists; and providing material support for terrorists. Padilla was originally arrested on accusations that he planned to set off radioactive ""dirty bombs"" in the United States. Thursday's convictions are not related to those accusations, and prosecutors did not present the ""dirty bomb"" plot to the jury. A federal court jury in Miami deliberated for just under two days before handing down the verdict. Jurors declined to speak to the media. ""They've had enough,"" said court clerk Ivan Marchena.    Watch latest news of Padilla verdict from CNN's Susan Candiotti » . All three defendants face life in prison when they are sentenced on December 5. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales -- who is on vacation this week -- issued a statement saying, ""The conviction of Jose Padilla -- an American who provided material support to terrorists and trained for violent jihad -- is a significant victory in our efforts to fight the threat posed by terrorists and their supporters."" Padilla received a ""fair trial and a just verdict,"" the White House said in a statement. ""We commend the jury for its work in this trial and thank it for upholding a core American principle of impartial justice for all,"" the statement said. Defense attorneys argued at trial that Padilla went overseas only to study Islam. Padilla's mother, Estela Lebron, told CNN her son will appeal the verdict. ""I'm not surprised by anything in this place anymore,"" she said. ""This is a Republican city."" Lebron blamed President Bush for the outcome of the trial and said there was not enough evidence in the case to convict her son. Attorneys for the other defendants also vowed to appeal, saying they were ""stunned"" by the decision. ""An innocent man was wrongly convicted today and we're going to do what we can to clear his name,"" said William Swor, the attorney for Jayyousi. ""We're all stunned ... because Dr. Jayyousi is innocent, because there was no evidence presented except pieces of conversations spun from another language that have so many different meanings. ""We're going to fight to get him released,"" he added. Padilla attorney Anthony Natale declined to comment on the outcome. The verdict is a ""critical vindication"" for the U.S. Department of Justice and its post-9/11 strategy for prosecuting terrorism cases, said Kendall Coffey, former U.S. attorney in Miami who comments on legal matters for CNN. ""I think this is huge for DOJ,"" he said, ""given the case's background of controversy and the government's mixed results in other (terror) trials."" He said the verdict also raises questions about whether military tribunals are necessary. ""Critics of the post-9/11 war on terrorism can point to this and say you don't need military tribunals, you can get the job done with civilian trials,"" Coffey said. During the trial, prosecutors played more than 70 intercepted phone calls among the defendants for jurors, including seven that featured Padilla, 36. He is a Brooklyn-born convert to Islam. FBI agent John Kavanaugh testified that the calls were made in code, which Padilla used to discuss traveling overseas to fight with Islamic militants, along with side trips to Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. In closing arguments, Padilla's lawyers argued he never spoke in code. His voice is heard on only seven of 300,000 taped conversations. They also tried to rebut a key piece of prosecution evidence -- an al Qaeda terrorist training camp application or ""mujahedeen data form."" A covert CIA officer -- who testified in disguise at Padilla's trial -- said he was given the form in Afghanistan, and a fingerprint expert found Padilla's prints on the form, prosecutors said. ""The al Qaeda application virtually sealed his fate,"" said Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School. He compared the document's value as evidence to ""putting a duffle bag with severed heads on the table."" But Michael Caruso, Padilla's defense attorney, said the prints on the form were not consistent with someone who filled out the document. ""Jose at some point handled the document, but did not fill out the form,"" Caruso said. Just as prosecutors did not present the dirty bomb plot to the jury, neither were jurors told that Padilla was held in a Navy brig for 3½ years without charges before his indictment in the Miami case. Turley said the case was troubling because it appears Padilla was kept in the brig in violation of his rights, for no legitimate reason. ""The evidence changed very little in the 3½ years Padilla was held without charges or access to a lawyer as an 'enemy combatant,' "" he said. Before trial, his lawyers tried to argue that he was no longer mentally competent to stand trial after years of solitary confinement and abuse -- allegations the government strongly denied. Padilla was taken into custody in Chicago as he stepped off a flight from Pakistan in 2002, and Bush declared him an ""enemy combatant"" and had him transferred to military custody. He was never charged as an ""enemy combatant"" and was eventually transferred from military to civilian custody where he was finally charged. The Supreme Court ducked the chance to rule on the legality of Padilla's military detention in 2006, arguing that the issue was moot after his transfer to civilian custody for the Miami trial.

"LUANDA, Angola (Reuters)  -- Holden Roberto, a central figure in Angola's struggle for independence from Portugal, died on Thursday in the capital of Luanda, the state newspaper said on Friday. Holden Roberto, left,  a father of Angola's independence, shown in 1975. He died August 2, 2007, in Luanda. Roberto founded the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) in the early 1960s and presided over the party until his death at age 84, the Jornal de Angola said. It said he died of an illness but did not give details. Roberto was one of the leaders who signed accords that led to the country's independence in 1975. Angola then fell into a civil war spanning nearly three decades that killed around 1 million people and displaced millions more. Roberto, who moved to Paris at independence, came back to Angola to take part in elections in 1992 which were followed by political turmoil. The presidential poll was aborted after a disputed first round, prompting a return to the conflict between the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and government forces. The war ended in 2002. The FNLA is Angola's third-biggest opposition party after UNITA, with five members in parliament. Angola, which is enjoying an oil boom, high economic growth and widespread foreign investment, is expected to hold parliamentary and presidential elections in 2008 and 2009, the first national polls in some 15 years.

"Vladivostok, Russia (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signaled Saturday that Congress could move to repeal Cold War-era legislation governing trade relations with Russia as soon as this month. Clinton's comments regarding the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment came as she addressed business leaders in the Russian city of Vladivostok, where she is standing in for President Barack Obama at the head of the U.S. delegation to the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. ""To make sure our companies get to compete here in Russia, we are working closely with the United States Congress to terminate the application to Jackson-Vanik to Russia and grant Russian Permanent Normalized Trade Relations,"" she said. ""We hope that the Congress will pass on this important piece of legislation this month."" The Jackson-Vanik amendment was passed in 1974 as a way of pressuring Russia to allow Soviet Jews to emigrate. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, that was no longer an issue, but legislators kept the amendment on the books to pressure Russia on other issues. The United States has waived it every year since 1994, but it still violates World Trade Organization rules requiring members of the body to give one another permanent normal trade relations. Russia finally entered the WTO this summer, raising the stakes for the United States to end a measure that critics warn could end up costing it business. Clinton discussed the Jackson-Vanik amendment with her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov over a working breakfast, Nuland said. ""She said that the Congress was going to start voting and that we have strongly pushed and been supportive, and we think that it's time for Jackson-Vanik to be repealed,"" Nuland said of Clinton. The Secretary of State shares the concerns of many in Congress about the human rights situation in Russia ""and we're continuing to talk to them about those issues,"" Nuland added. Clinton and Lavrov also debated the ongoing situations in Syria and Iran, Nuland said. On Syria, the themes were similar to discussions held in St. Petersburg in June, Nuland said. ""We remain extremely concerned that if the UN Security Council doesn't take a stronger stand in support of peace and security, that it is abrogating its responsibility, that we need to do it in a way where there are consequences for noncompliance, which the Russians have not been supportive of in the past and which we really think are necessary if it's going to actually advance the ball,"" Nuland said. Clinton also made clear to Lavrov that U.S. concerns extended to the ""extremely negative effect"" of the ongoing conflict in Syria on stability in the wider region, Nuland said. Clinton labels Pakistan-based group as terrorists . Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin held one-on-one talks before dinner Saturday evening, when the question of Syria came up again. They also discussed Iran, missile defense and the need for increased bilateral trade and investment in the 15-minute meeting, before turning to wild life conservation and other matters over dinner. Clinton spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda too, on issues including a hotly disputed set of small islands in the East China Sea. The question of sovereignty over the islands has led to renewed diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Tokyo in recent weeks. In the course of their meeting Saturday morning, Clinton and Lavrov signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in the Antarctic and another on strengthening U.S.-Russian interregional cooperation. Clinton said the agreements would stimulate economic growth and deepen the two nations' scientific cooperation in Antarctica. ""Scientists from both our countries will work together to explore Antarctica's terrain, study the effects of climate change, and cooperate on a range of issues to better understand and protect our shared environment,"" she said. The Obama administration had previously indicated its desire to lift the Jackson-Vanik amendment as part of its ""reset"" of U.S. relations with Moscow. And in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal in June, Clinton argued that leaving the amendment in place could hurt U.S. interests. Clinton visits young nation of East Timor, misses husband's speech . Ending Jackson-Vanik is not ""a gift to Russia,"" Clinton wrote. ""It is a smart, strategic investment in one of the fastest growing markets for U.S. goods and services."" Clinton's visit to Russia is the last stop on a week-and-a-half-long trip to the Asia Pacific region. She became the first U.S. secretary of state Thursday to visit East Timor since the developing Southeast Asian nation gained full independence from Indonesia 10 years ago, meeting with President Taur Matan Ruak and Prime Minister Kay Rala Xanana Gusmao. She also stopped by Brunei. Earlier in the week, she held a series of meetings with senior Chinese officials, including Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, in Beijing. Her tour started in the Cook Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, followed by a visit to Indonesia, an increasingly important regional player.

"(CNN) -- At least four people, including three soldiers, were killed on Tuesday in a blast that struck a military truck as it traveled along a road in Turkey's southeastern Tunceli province, according to local officials and state media. Turkish state TV channel TRT reported the deaths and several injuries on its website, and blamed the attack on terrorists. One of those killed was a passerby. It was unclear if the attack caused more casualties. Many ambulances were sent to the scene in central Tunceli, the semiofficial Anatolia news agency reported. An official with the Tunceli governor's office, who was not identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN that the office was not yet able to confirm the number of dead or injured. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. However, suspicion within Turkey is likely to fall on Kurdish militants. Tunceli province is a predominantly Kurdish region where frequent clashes have occurred between the Turkish military and fighters from the militant Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. The International Crisis Group said in a report last week that Turkey's long-simmering war with the Kurdish insurgency had escalated, raising casualties to a level not seen in more than a decade. More than 700 people have been killed in the past 14 months, according to the conflict resolution organization that has extensively researched Turkey's war with the PKK. Turkey, the United States, and the European Union have formally labeled the PKK a terrorist organization. The Kurds, Turkey's largest ethnic minority, make up roughly 20 percent of the population.

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said Tuesday he does not trust Tehran's assertions that it is not pursuing a nuclear weapon, and he urged the international community to pressure Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to allow inspectors to verify his claims.

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- A plane caught fire and crashed soon after taking off from the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu, killing all 19 people on board, the Himalayan country's Civil Aviation Authority said Friday. There were 16 passengers and three crew members on the plane when it crashed near the Manohara River in Bhaktapur District, the Civil Aviation Authority said.

"(CNN) -- Forgive the pun: Want a slice of early Apple history? Three of the legal documents that detail the founding of the revolutionary computer company are going up for auction soon -- some two months after the death of co-founder Steve Jobs. Sotheby's, the auction house that's hosting the sale, expects the legal papers to sell for $100,000 to $150,000. ""The 1976 document, which once belonged to Ronald G. Wayne, one of Apple's founders along with Steven P. Jobs and Stephen G. Wozniak, is the first chapter in the story of one of America's most important companies,"" Sotheby's says in a press release. Here's a list of what's included in the auction: . -- Apple's original partnership agreement, signed on April 1, 1976, by Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Apple's ""forgotten founder,"" Ron Wayne. According to Walter Isaacson in his new ""Steve Jobs"" biography, Jobs signed the document in lower-case letters, ""Wozniak in careful cursive and Wayne in an illegible squiggle."" The trio signed the document in Wayne's apartment and split their stakes in the company unevenly: Jobs and Wozniak both got 45%; Wayne, who came to the confab late as a consultant of sorts, got a 10% share. -- A dissolution of contract, in which Wayne excused himself from the company for $800. He later received an additional $1,500 payment. Bad move, right? His stock options today would be worth more than $30 billion. But Wayne told CNN in 2010 that he doesn't regret the decision, which he based on the fact that another company he founded had gone poorly. ""What can I say? You make a decision based on your understanding of the circumstances and you live with it,"" he said. -- And a second founding agreement, in which Jobs, the marketing master, and Wozniak, the coding genius, outlined their plans for the company that would help bring about the personal computer revolution and create the iPod, iPhone and, most recently, the iPad. The documents originally belonged to Wayne and were given to Sotheby's through a university archives, the auction house's website says. A Sotheby's spokesman said the company could not provide more information but emphasized that Wayne had not sold the documents directly to the auction house. ""The consigner bought the documents in the mid-1990s from a manuscript dealer who had acquired them from Wayne,"" Bloomberg reports, citing Richard Austin, head of manuscripts at Sotheby's in New York. Austin told that news organization: ""It was right before Jobs rejoined Apple. At the time, everyone thought that Apple was pretty much finished."" The auction will be held on December 13 in New York. People can also bid on the documents simultaneously online. So far, Twitter chatter about the sale is mostly positive, with online pundits joking that they want to add the documents to their holiday shopping lists and pondering what will be the ultimate sticker price of these bits of history.","Original 1976 Apple contract is going up for auction on December 13 .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama and GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan on Friday traded sharp criticism over health care reforms and Medicare, with each telling a leading advocacy group for senior citizens that the other was being untruthful. ""Contrary to what you've heard and what you may hear from subsequent speakers, Obamacare actually strengthened Medicare,"" the president told the AARP Liffe@50+ event, using the nickname for the 2010 Affordable Care Act that passed with no Republican support. In particular, he called the claim by Ryan and other Republicans that $716 billion is being cut from Medicare to fund the health care bill ""simply not true."" Ryan spoke to the same event shortly afterward, saying that Obama's contention that the health care law strengthened Medicare was ""just not true,"" adding that the legislation ""turned Medicare into a piggy bank for Obamacare."" The debate over Medicare is a major issue in the November election campaign, especially in the vital battleground state of Florida with its large population of senior citizens. Ryan headed to Florida later Friday, while Obama campaigned in Virginia, Vice President Joe Biden spoke in New Hampshire and GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney headed to Las Vegas. All four states are considered up-for-grabs in the election less than seven weeks away. In a separate development, Romney released details of his 2011 income tax return that showed he made $13.7 million last year and paid $1.94 million in federal taxes, giving him an effective tax rate of 14.1%, his campaign said. The majority of the candidate's income last year came from his investments, Brad Malt, the trustee of Romney's blind trust, said in a blog post. The Romneys gave just over $4 million to charity. In addition, the Romney campaign said his tax filings from 1990 to 2009 show that he and his wife paid 100% of the federal and state income taxes they owed and that their overall average annual effective federal tax rate was 20.2%. Romney has been criticized by Democrats and even some Republicans for not releasing more than two years worth of taxes. His wealth and investment industry background, as well as his father's decision to release a dozen years of tax records during his presidential run four decades ago, have only raised interest in Romney's returns. Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter said in a statement the disclosure ""continues to mask Romney's true wealth"" and income from the private equity firm he once led, leaving the American people in the dark about critical details of his finances. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called the new tax information insufficient. ""What we don't know is why he refuses to be straight with the American people about the choices he's made in his financial life,"" according to a statement from Reid, who previously created a stir when he alleged Romney paid no taxes in some years but refused to divulge the source of his accusation. ""When will the American people see the returns he filed before he was running for president?"" Reid asked. Obama responds to health care attacks . In his appearance by satellite at the AARP event in New Orleans, Obama responded to specific attacks on the health care law by Ryan and other Republicans, declaring the 2010 measure cuts waste and fraud in Medicare, provides preventive care to keep people healthier and reduces prescription drug costs for seniors. Romney pivots after controversies distract campaign . Savings come from ""using the purchasing power of Medicare to say to doctors and hospitals and insurance companies: 'You guys need to work smarter,'"" Obama said to applause. ""Instead of having five different tests that each of you is charging for, do one test and email it to everybody."" Ryan, the conservative House Budget Committee chairman from Wisconsin, has proposed a partial privatization of the entitlement that would provide government subsidies to help senior citizens pay for coverage they would choose from a list of options. He defended the plan Friday in the face of a mixed reception. ""The first step to a stronger Medicare is to repeal Obamacare because it represents the worst of both worlds,"" Ryan said to loud booing. He added: ""I had a feeling there'd be mixed reaction so let me get into it ."" ""It weakens Medicare for today's seniors and puts it at risk for the next generation,"" Ryan said, repeating the factually challenged claim of $716 billion in Medicare cuts and also targeting a panel created under the health care law charged with recommending ways to reach targeted savings starting in 2014. Ryan also took a swipe at Obama's re-election slogan of ""Forward,"" saying it means ""Forward into a future where seniors are denied the care they earned because a bureaucrat decided it wasn't worth the money."" In his remarks, Obama argued that Medicare savings come from ""using the purchasing power of Medicare to say to doctors and hospitals and insurance companies: 'You guys need to work smarter."" ""Instead of having five different tests that each of you is charging for, do one test and email it to everybody,"" he said to applause. With polls showing Romney unable to overtake Obama with less than seven weeks to go until the November election, GOP infighting is showing a rising frustration over the candidate's campaign against a president saddled by high unemployment and a sluggish economy. New figures show Obama and his allies raised nearly $85 million in August, outpacing Romney's haul in the month that included both parties' national conventions. Obama defends record on immigration at Univision forum . In Wisconsin, conservative candidate Tommy Thompson put some of the blame for his slipping poll numbers on the Romney campaign and conservative commentators, including former GOP speechwriter Peggy Noonan, have depicted the Romney team as floundering. ""Stop it. This is hard. You want to try it? Get in the ring,"" Ann Romney said of her husband's critics in an interview on Thursday with Radio Iowa. Romney tweaked his campaign strategy twice this week in response to controversies that distracted from his main message challenging Obama's record as president. On Thursday, he kept up attacks on Obama over a 1998 comment regarding redistribution of wealth, and also claimed the president had given up on changing Washington. The Obama camp fired back that the criticism was off base. At the AARP event Friday, Obama said the Ryan proposal to reform Medicare would make it a voucher program that shifts health care costs to senior citizens. He noted that AARP supported the 2010 health care reform act and opposed Ryan's Medicare proposal. ""They know that a voucher program is not going to be a good deal,"" Obama said. Ryan, however, denied it was a voucher program and insisted that the idea originated in Democratic proposals of the past. ""This financial support system is designed to guarantee that seniors can always afford Medicare coverage -- no exceptions,"" he said to some applause. Members of AARP -- a nonprofit organization and a powerful lobbying group that boasts of having more than 37 million members -- submitted questions to the nominees on their website. Tough stretch for Romney . Romney is coming off a tough stretch in the weeks before the three presidential debates in October. Last week, the Romney campaign struggled in its initial response to anti-American violence in Libya and Egypt. Then a left-leaning magazine released secretly recorded clips of Romney speaking at a May fund-raiser in which he said 47% of Americans depended on government help, saw themselves as victims and won't support him. Under criticism for the comments at the fund-raiser, Romney stuck by them and rallied some conservative commentators to his side by emphasizing his message on his allegation that Obama's polices increased public dependency on government. Clinton on the '47 percent' comments and the debates . In particular, they accused Obama of favoring wealth redistribution -- code for socialism among conservatives -- based on the 1998 video of the president when he was a state senator in Illinois. ""I think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution -- because I actually believe in some redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody's got a shot,"" Obama says in the clip, posted Tuesday on the conservative Drudge Report website. The White House on Wednesday characterized the GOP attacks over the redistribution comment as an effort to divert attention from Romney's remarks at the May fundraiser. Romney also took aim at Obama's comment on Thursday at a Univision ""Meet the Candidates"" forum in which the president said he was unable to change Washington from within. House Speaker John Boehner continued the Romney attack line on Friday, saying Obama and congressional Democrats lacked the leadership qualities necessary to change the culture of partisan divide and legislative gridlock. ""It takes courage, it takes determination and it takes sincerity, and it's called leadership,"" Boehner told reporters. Asked about the inability to work out compromises with Republicans on deficit reduction and other major issues, Obama blamed GOP intransigence and said he was being a leader by rejecting what he called ""bad ideas."" He noted that his proposals, including the health care reform measure opposed by every Republican, included some ideas with GOP origins. ""Obamacare owes a debt to what was done in Massachusetts by my opponent, Mr. Romney, even though sometimes he denies it,"" the president said in a jab at his challenger, who passed a similar plan while governor of the state but now vows to repeal the federal version. ""The one thing I won't do though is go along with bad ideas that are not helping the middle class,"" Obama said to applause, adding: ""If I hear the only way Republicans in Congress are willing to move forward is to voucherize Medicare, I'll say no."" Polls: GOP Senate takeover might be tougher . CNN's Shawna Shepherd, Paul Steinhauser, Dana Davidsen, Peter Hamby and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.","NEW: Sen.

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- After intense diplomacy, the government of Mali and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have agreed that troops from the West African regional block can be based in the capital of Bamako, as a step toward ending conflict in the northern part of the country. According to the agreement between the Malian government and ECOWAS, authorities have given the green light for a logistics base on the outskirts of the city. ""There will be no foreign troops fighting in the capital. In return, ECOWAS requires operational headquarters and a base in Bamako together with a police force,"" said Nouhou Togo, communications Officer at Mali's Ministry of Defence. United Nations backing for the force will be sought this week by the Malian government and ECOWAS, and is likely to be followed by further negotiations. ""A crisis like this is not solved over night. It takes time and preparation. Though, when that day comes, the Malian army is ready to go in the north,"" said Togo. Following a military coup in the capital in March, Islamists seized control of two-thirds of the Texas-sized nation. Mali -- seen as a stable democracy and an example for other less stable countries in the region -- was thrown into chaos. Islamist groups -- some of them with links to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM -- swiftly seized key towns in the vast and scarcely populated north. Soon after taking the towns of Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu, they implemented a hardline form of sharia law including capital and corporal punishments for relatively minor offenses. Thieves had their hands and feet amputated while a couple accused of adultery were stoned to death. Plans for a large presence of ECOWAS troops has been fueling political tensions in Bamako for weeks. Over the last month, the West African regional block has had 3,300 regional troops on standby waiting for a go-ahead from Bamako. Meanwhile Interim President Dioncounda Traore has opposed a regional force based in Bamako. Capt. Amadou Haya Sanogo, who led a military junta that toppled the government in March, has made it clear that he does not want ECOWAS troops in the south of the country, which he argues is already secured by the Malian military. Resistance to an actual force in the Malian capital has also come from several groups, outspoken politicians and the Malian people worried about foreign troops flooding into the capital. The request for 3,000 troops to help defeat the Islamists and regain control of the north will be considered during a meeting chaired by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday. Before the deployment can go ahead, it will need a mandate from the Security Council, which earlier rejected an intervention plan because of a lack of detail. Following the agreement announced Sunday regarding ECOWAS troops, there are still uncertainties about the details of troop deployment. ""The question is if the Malian military is ready to go fight in the north. So far I have not seen any proof of this,"" says Gilles Yabi, a researcher with the International Crisis Group, a Brussel-based nongovernment organiztion seeking to end conflicts. ""The government is still very disorganized and has not been able to agree with the Malian military regarding troops deployment,"" said Yabi, from Dakar in neighboring Senegal. Given that most of the Islamist northern strongholds are in urbanized areas, a military intervention risks harming civilians and even more displacement. According to U.N. figures, over 450,000 Malians have already been displaced from their homes -- an ECOWAS intervention could well raise that number. ""In any scenario a military intervention will have serious humanitarian implications. To date, there has been very little fighting since government forces fled the north -- for the most part armed groups simply carved up the territory. But once the government in Bamako begins to act, conflict in the north will escalate,"" said Bertrand Soret at the European Union liazon office in Bamako. At some point, argues Yabi, the use of force will probably be necessary to neutralize transnational armed groups that indulge in terrorism, jihadism and drug and arms trafficking, and to restore Mali's territorial integrity. ""To stabilize Mali, the government will have to agree with the Algerian politicians to tackle the influx of arms and combatants between a Libya still struggling after the fall of (Moammar) Gaddafi and northern Mali through southern Algeria,"" said Yabi. ""Minimal and sustainable security in northern Mali cannot be re-established without the clear involvement of the Algerian political and military authorities. This is not something the Malian army and ECOWAS forces will be able to tackle themselves.""","After a military coup in March, Islamists seized two-thirds of Mali .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The author of the yet-to-be-published book ""No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden"" wrote it under the pseudonym Mark Owen. The book's publisher said the special operations forces team member did not want to reveal his name to protect himself and his family. But only a day after the New York Times first reported the book was coming out, Fox News reported the author's real name on its website and posted photos of him in combat gear. SEAL releasing book on bin Laden raid . Later Thursday, the Associated Press also revealed Owen's real name. When CNN asked Pentagon officials if they could confirm the author's identity, it was asked not to report his name out of concern for his former colleagues who could still be active. On Thursday, the New York Times said the book's publisher, Dutton, put out a statement after Owen's name was revealed. ""Mark Owen, like every SEAL he has served with, has put his life on the line time and again for his country for more than a decade. Sharing the true story of his personal experience in ""No Easy Day"" is a courageous act in the face of obvious risks to his personal security.

The AP said it was not asked by the Pentagon to withhold the name. The author and the book's publisher did not answer calls for comment. TV interviews with the author must be put in shadow, and similar interviews for print would not reveal his real identity in order to keep the protection he is seeking, according to news reports. News organizations have been asked to sign a non-disclosure document in order to do the interviews. Pentagon officials told CNN that Owen and the publishing company did not submit the manuscript through the proper Department of Defense channels to check if secret tactics, techniques and procedures were revealed about the 2011 bin Laden mission. ""Mark Owen"" spent more than a decade in the military and left the service last April, Pentagon officials said.

"(CNN) -- Police in Switzerland arrested Guatemala's former national police chief over allegations he was involved in extrajudicial killings while in office, the judicial authority in Geneva said. Erwin Sperisen, 42, who was detained Friday afternoon, holds dual Swiss and Guatemalan nationality and lives in Geneva, the judicial authority said in a statement. ""Details provided by the Guatemalan authorities at the end of 2011 and recent developments in the case raise important suspicions about the suspect's involvement in various extrajudicial executions committed while he was director of Guatemala's national police from July 2004 to March 2007,"" it said. Claims against Sperisen had also been filed by various associations in 2007 and 2008, it said. A coalition of non-governmental organizations has been working on the case against Sperisen, said Trial, a Swiss non-governmental organization that aims to combat impunity. An international arrest warrant was issued by Guatemala for Sperisen in 2010, Trial said in a statement. Trial and rights group Amnesty International had since urged the Swiss authorities to act, it said. Sperisen cannot be extradited to Guatemala because he holds Swiss nationality, the judicial authority said. Trial said the coalition of NGOs involved ""welcomes the steps taken by the Swiss prosecuting authorities."" The arrest ""represents a major advance in the case"" and demonstrates ""the credibility of the charges"" brought against Sperisen, it said.

"London (CNN) -- I was standing just a few meters from Prince Harry as he got to his feet. His older brother Prince William was there too. But this was Harry's show -- a charity mission to Maseru, the capital of the poverty-stricken African Kingdom of Lesotho where the prince had established a charity Sentebale, to aid the country's vulnerable children. It was a mission, back in June 2010, and one of which the younger prince is rightly proud. Within seconds of starting his speech, however, Harry couldn't resist a playful swipe at his older brother. Yet again, the third in line to the throne, who proudly boasts a healthy mop of red hair, mocked William's receding hairline. It is a running joke -- but this time William clearly thought it had been cracked once too often. He lent back against the wall, raised his eyes skywards in genuine frustration but said nothing. Prince Harry was once again playing for laughs. Predictably, at his brother's expense, he got them. William, not for the first time, simply suffered in silence. Naked Harry scandal a watershed moment for UK press . That incident sums the pair up perfectly. Harry is a showman, a natural performer in front of the camera and a microphone. He is warm, naughty, an extrovert and has a sense of fun. As a result people warm to him. Like his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, he is flawed and that makes him interesting. People love his madcap ways and seem able to forgive him when he gets it wrong. He has worn a Nazi uniform, been exposed for taking drugs and boozing and making racist comments. Yet we forgive him time after time. Now his naked romp in the sin capital of the world, Las Vegas, has heaped further embarrassment on the Royal Family. But the chances are it will blow over and we will fall in love with this princely rogue again. The reason for this maybe rooted in the fact that deep down the British public -- who after all fund his security and at least part of his lifestyle -- know unless there is a major disaster he won't actually get his hands of the Crown Jewels. He can have all the fame and wealth, but in truth very little of the responsibility. Nude Harry Photos - how the UK tabloids lost their sting . For Prince William, as second in line to the throne, his future is very different and he knows it. He cannot let his hair down in public -- if the future King was exposed doing what Harry was snapped doing, it would raise serious questions about his suitability to one day be Britain's Head of State, a position gifted to him by birthright. When they were boys Diana often confided to friends that she thought Harry would make a good King. He, she thought, had a better temperament for the top job. She even gave him the nickname GKH for ""Good King Harry."" William, always shy and less outgoing than Harry, was more introspective, weighed down perhaps by expectation. It was Harry who frustrated his protection officers by crashing royal cars into walls on the private estates and on one occasion wondering off into a public high street with a police radio for the hell of it. William was always more careful, conscious perhaps that it would be his head that would one day wear the Crown. How 'soldier prince' Harry tore up royal rule book . But as an adult William has grown into his role perfectly. He fits the bill as a future King perfectly. He speaks well, conducts himself with aplomb on and off duty. Since his marriage to his university sweetheart, Kate Middleton now HRH Duchess of Cambridge, if anything he has grown in confidence and composure. The pair look every inch a future King and Queen, and the modern monarchy safe in their hands. When they go to nightclubs -- which they do -- there is never a hint of louche behavior or scandal. They have a few drinks and go home. It may be a little dull, maybe even predictable, but it is what is expected of them. He is after all a senior royal not a celebrity. Since his marriage last year, William has been seen less and less on the clubbing scene, preferring instead to have a quiet night in or dinner at an Italian restaurant with his wife. This has led to Harry saying his brother has become boring. But nothing could be further from the truth. Prince William helps save girl from drowning . William, may not have served on the frontline like Apache pilot Harry, but he risks his personal safety every time he pilots his RAF Search and Rescue helicopter from RAF Valley in North Wales. He only recently was in charge of a daring rescue of a teenage girl. He combines these duties with official tours abroad and does so tirelessly, sometimes completing engagements at a hospital or charity venue after a 24 hour shift on duty. Harry is clearly a good soldier. He served with distinction as a Troop commander in Afghanistan before an internet leak that he was there forced him to return early from his tour of duty. He will no doubt soon be returning there as an Apache pilot and again, I have no doubt, serve his country well. Embarrassing pics could harm a soldier's career several way . Perhaps this latest naked controversy will focus his mind. Perhaps it will force this ""Peter Pan"" Prince to grow up and leave his schoolboy antics behind. The next time he goes to poke fun at his older, more cautious brother, he might just hold his tongue. For surely now is the time for him to wise up and follow Prince William's example. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Jobson .","Harry is a showman, a natural performer in front of the camera and a microphone .
Like his mother, Diana, he is flawed and that makes him interesting .
It's a very different story for brother Prince William, second in line to the throne .
Will perfectly fits bill as future King - he speaks well and conducts himself with aplomb ."
"(Mashable) -- There's a massive telescope on the drawing board that hasn't even started construction yet, but when it's finished in 2024, it'll generate more data in a single day than the entire Internet. For scientists to ensure they'll be able to handle all that raw information, they need to start working on new computing technologies now. Fortunately, IBM is on it. The computing giant is collaborating with ASTRON (the Netherlands Institute of Radio Astronomy) to develop the next-generation computer tech needed to handle the colossal amount of data captured by the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), a new radio telescope that will spread sensing equipment over a span 3,000 kilometers wide, or about the width of the continental U.S.A. ""One of the goals is to search what happened at the time of the Big Bang, 13 billion years ago,"" IBM researcher Ronanld Luijten told Mashable. ""We need to figure out what technology needs to be chosen in order to build this large antenna."" The project is called DOME, and it's challenged to find a way to capture and process approximately one exabyte every day, which works out to about twice the amount of data that's generated every day by the World Wide Web, IBM says. To do that in a way that doesn't consume a massive amount of energy, IBM will need to develop some entirely new processing architectures before construction on the telescope begins in 2017. ""We need to be very creative,"" says Luijten. ""If we were to use standard servers of today, we'd need millions of them. They would use so much space and use so much energy that we couldn't afford to build the machines let alone operate them."" While the project has only just been announced, IBM already has some ideas in the hopper. Specifically, it'll be looking at novel ways of stacking chips (today's chips are flat, though stacking or ""3D"" tech is around the corner) and using optical technology for interconnects, something the company has already had some success with. The promising new conductive material graphene, however, probably won't play a part. ""Graphene will not be available in time to build something we start in 2017,"" says Luijten. ""But it might be available for a later generation. The expectation is that we will go with the traditional CMOS process."" See also: IBM: Mind-reading machines will change our lives . Even though the new computing tech hasn't even been invented yet, it'll ironically still rely on one of the oldest storage technologies in existence: magnetic tape. Luijten says tape simply can't be matched by newer storage mediums since it's so cost-, space- and power-efficient. The project won't exclusively use tape for storage, though, also relying on phase-change media and solid-state drives. ""We're looking at new memory technologies,"" says Luijten, ""but at the end of the day most of the data likely will remain on tape because it's still the most cost-effective storage medium. Tape will be around for a long time."" The SKA isn't planned to be completed until 2024, but the technologies that IBM creates to service it will have the potential to change entire industries in the meantime, dealing with big-data problems that the world is just now encountering. It's possible the social networks and search engines of the future will be powered by IBM's coming tech or something like it, enabling them to process an entire Internet's worth of data for anyone and everyone.

"(CNN) -- Olympic fever gripped the host nation on Wednesday as Britain won its first gold medals of the 2012 Games, but in a quiet corner of England arguably the greatest sporting performance of the day was played out before a much smaller audience of just 13,000 people. Frankel, the world's top-ranked racehorse, defended his unbeaten record in typically emphatic style, thrashing his rivals to win the showpiece Sussex Stakes at the Glorious Goodwood meeting by sixth lengths from Farhh -- a valiant second under Frankie Dettori. He became the first horse to win the Group One race two years in a row. It was the 12th victory of Frankel's career, and the eighth at Group One level -- seven of those in a row, drawing him level with Rock of Gibraltar and Miss Terrible but two short of Zenyatta's leading elite mark. The margin of victory would have been greater had jockey Tom Queally not eased Frankel down in the final strides, but his success was widely expected. The Henry Cecil-trained four-year-old was sent off at odds of 20-1 on, meaning a bet of $20 would return just $1. Although there are few certainties in the field of athletic endeavor, the result of this race never looked in doubt. Led out, as usual, by his big brother and pace maker Bullet Train, Frankel destroyed the field with such insouciant ease that at times the race resembled a time trial. Even cycling champion Bradley Wiggins, however, is not capable of the sustained burst of speed that is Frankel's hallmark -- every one of his all-devouring strides opened up more and ground between him and the rest of the field. While Frankel is undoubtedly great news for racing -- he is the only equine athlete who regularly grabs the headlines from his human counterparts -- to some degree the hype around this superstar has turned him into a victim of his own success. These days he runs against ever-dwindling fields -- on this occasion just three rivals went to the start, and that included stable companion Bullet Train, whose sole purpose in life is to give Frankel a flying start in his races then humbly fade into obscurity in the final furlongs. If horses were capable of sibling rivalry, then Bullet Train would surely be a candidate for the psychiatrist's couch. Given the testing conditions at the West Sussex course (several horses had already come a cropper around the famously tight right-hand bend), this was never going to be a procession on the scale of the 11-length drubbing Frankel handed out at Royal Ascot back in June. But sixth lengths -- and an eased-down sixth lengths at that -- is still a huge margin in racing terms. Frankel's next challenge will be the Juddmonte Stakes at York later this month, which will see him step up from the mile distance for the first time in his career. If there was a cloud to Frankel's silver lining it was that Cecil, who has masterminded the horse's career to perfection, could not be at Goodwood to enjoy his colt's success. The 69-year-old is undergoing another bout of treatment for cancer. His jockey, however, was a picture of modesty when accepting the plaudits for the horse's latest performance: ""He does it all very easily and therefore I have a very easy job,"" Queally told reporters. ""All I have to do is steer."" Such is Frankel's dominance in his own sport that the comparisons tend to be made with athletes from outside of his own species, such as 0.49-furlong runner Usain Bolt, record-breaking swimmer Michael Phelps or the hitherto-peerless Mohammed Ali. If the successes keep coming in this fashion, Ali et al had better watch their backs, for, human or non-human, we could be witnessing the greatest of all time.","Frankel becomes first horse to defend Sussex Stakes title at Glorious Goodwood .

"(CNN) -- A South Korea court ruled that both Apple and Samsung violated each other's patents, in a case that mimics legal battles between the electronics giants around the world. The Seoul District Court ordered each side to pay the other damages. Apple must pay Samsung 40 million won ($35,300); Samsung is to pay Apple 25 million won ($22,000). The court banned sales in South Korea of Apple's iPhone 4 and iPad 2, Samsung's Galaxy SII and Galaxy Nexus smartphones and Galaxy Tab and Galaxy 10.1 tablet computers. Both Samsung and Apple may appeal the lower court decision. The decision comes as a jury in California decides a similar patent case in the U.S., with much higher stakes for the companies. Apple accuses Samsung of copying the design of the iPhone and iPad, and is suing Samsung for $2.5 billion. Samsung denies any wrongdoing and is counter suing Apple for $519 million, also for patent infringement. Similar patent cases between Apple and Samsung are being heard in Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia.

"Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian rebels and the government are in ""exploratory"" talks to end the country's nearly 50-year armed conflict, President Juan Manuel Santos said Monday. Speaking on national TV, the president said military operations would continue alongside any negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as the FARC. The FARC, which has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s, is Latin America's oldest insurgency. ""We have developed exploratory talks with the FARC to seek an end to the conflict,"" said Santos, whose popularity has suffered because of the widespread perception that security has worsened under his leadership. He vowed to avoid the mistakes of the past. ""Colombians can rest assured that the government is acting with prudence, seriousness and firmness -- always putting first the welfare and peace of all residents,"" the president said. Santos invited members of a second rebel group -- the National Liberation Army, or ELN -- to also join in the talks. Earlier, current and former government sources told CNN that the government and rebels met in Cuba to discuss the possibility of peace. Present at the discussions, the sources said, were members of the FARC and representatives of Santos. The sources asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with media. Previously on CNN.com: Indigenous groups clash with Colombian soldiers . The Venezuelan government was reportedly key to bringing the two sides together, the sources said. Peace talks between the rebels and the government have occurred sporadically since the 1980s. The last attempt fell apart in 2002. Then-President Andres Pastrana ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country, in an apparent bid to strengthen their position. Since then, the sides have reached a kind of ""hurting stalemate,"" said Adam Isacson, senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America. Though severely weakened in recent years, the FARC continues to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. ""Neither side thinks they're going to win anytime soon,"" said Isacson. ""What they're looking at is losing thousands more people, with nothing to show for it."" Of course, it remains unclear whether the two sides will reach an agreement at all, and if they do, what that deal might look like. It's also unclear how much of the FARC the group's leadership would be able to deliver, said Isacson. The FARC opened the door for talks this year. In a January statement, rebels said they would be interested in addressing certain issues at a ""hypothetical negotiating table,"" calling on the government to address such subjects as privatization, deregulation and environmental degradation. The statement was signed by the FARC's leader, known as Timoleon Jimenez. ""This conflict will have no solution until our voices are heard. Without lies, Santos, without lies,"" the statement read. This spring, the FARC freed the last of 10 government hostages after holding them for more than a decade. In February, the rebel group said it would also stop kidnapping civilians for money. It did not address the fate of its civilian captives, nor did the group renounce kidnapping for political purposes. Hundreds of civilians remain prisoners of the guerrilla group throughout Colombia, according to the nonprofit Free Country Foundation. The United States and European Union consider the FARC a terrorist organization. Boos greet Colombian president in FARC area .

"Islamabad (CNN) -- The spotlight on so-called ""honor"" murders in South Asia and across the world in recent days has raised awareness about the deaths of countless innocent victims, but condemning the act and its perpetrators does little to end the murders or address the root causes of the problem. I started my career as a gender specialist working in many countries where ""honor"" murders and other acts of violence against women often found considerable public support. As a naÃ¯ve and newbie rebellious activist, I never asked ""why?"" Instead I set out on my activism by loudly condemning the culture of violence against women in these regions as if it were an isolated phenomenon from other longstanding gender-racial-religious injustices I witnessed. British court convicts parents of murder in ""honor"" murder . Expressing my horror and repulsion of ""honor"" murders with like-minded colleagues made me feel righteous and involved. But the more I focused my outrage on the perpetrators, the more I sensed a growing divide between ""them down below"" and ""us up above."" Husband issued death sentence after I asked for divorce . Of course, I was part of the ""us"" -- the humane, the educated, the egalitarian. Today, I am an aid worker in Islamabad, Pakistan. It's a job that has exposed me to the dehumanizing effects of war, poverty, economic disasters, and natural calamities. I have seen dehumanizing living conditions breed dehumanized people. The outcome is a nation where tens of millions of people live without their most basic needs being met. Every day I see Pakistanis robbed of their dignity, their hope, and ultimately their sense of significance. I believe every human being instinctively yearns for a sense of significance -- a reason why their absence or presence matters. In a culture where systematic dehumanization through corruption-fueled poverty makes a sense of self virtually impossible, I have found that it's useless to merely condemn those seeking it by being an ""honor"" killer or a ""protector of the Holy Book"" or even a ""suicide bomber."" Instead, I blame the wealthy, powerful and educated elite for failing to humanize the masses. Not with charity and altruism -- which are acts that still preserve the ""us up here"" and ""them down there"" divide -- but by demanding true political, economic and institutional change. I am well aware of the stakes at hand. A large section of Pakistan's powerful elite is made up of landlords exploiting a deeply rooted feudal system. Today, the feudal elite is entrenched in Pakistan's political system. For the feudal elite to eradicate poverty and ignorance, they must conjure the political will to create equality by pushing for land reform. They must pay for education and social welfare programs by enacting new tax laws. And they must demand transparency in government to end corruption. These drastic policy shifts are likely counterintuitive to the power elite's longstanding views on governance, but a solution to ""honor"" murders and the many injustices and inequalities in Pakistani society starts here. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dania Gharaibeh.","Dania Gharaibeh: Condemning the act and its perpetrators does little to end the murders .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The corruption trial of former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ended Tuesday with a mixed verdict. Olmert was found guilty of breach of trust, but was acquitted on two corruption-related charges. The allegations stemmed from 2002 to 2006, when Olmert served a second term mayor of Jerusalem and held several cabinet posts under then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Prosecutors accused Olmert of double-billing government agencies for travel, taking cash from an American businessman in exchange for official favors and acting on behalf of his former law partner's clients. Israeli political heavyweights publicly spar over Iran policy . ""The court decided that I breached trust. I honor the decision of the court, and will learn the lessons from this,"" Olmert said outside the courtroom. ""I want to remind you that the court said that there were procedural problems -- not corruption, I never got anything. I acted in a way which was counter to procedure. I honor that, and take it to my heart."" He said nothing about his political future and thanked his lawyers for their work. But Olmert still faces legal trouble as one of 16 suspects charged in the ongoing Holyland corruption trial, which involves developers who allegedly paid bribes to senior Jerusalem municipal officials in exchange for expedited approval of permits for a construction project. Olmert became prime minister in 2006 after succeeding Sharon, who suffered a massive stroke. He announced his resignation in August 2008 after Israeli police recommended that he stand trial. Olmert: Right-wing U.S. cash killed my peace plan . He left office after a new government took power in March 2009. Earlier this year, Olmert told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that millions of dollars from the ""extreme right wing"" in the United States helped oust him from government and derailed a peace plan with the Palestinians. In 2008, Olmert sought a ""full comprehensive peace between us and the Palestinians"" -- a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders. But the plan was never realized, and Olmert was forced from office accused of corruption. He had denied the allegations. ""I had to fight against superior powers, including millions and millions of dollars that were transferred from this country (the United States) by figures which were from the extreme right wing that were aimed to topple me as prime minister of Israel. There is no question about it,"" Olmert told CNN. Pressed to name names, Olmert replied: ""Next time.""

Bonner, who is from California, is accused of taking payments for union activities and using it for himself in a scheme to ""defraud some 14,000 dues-paying union members,"" Duffy said. ""These false claims included periods of time when Bonner was actually visiting his mistress in Chicago or family members, as well as trips to attend non-Union activities, such as hockey games and other sporting events,"" the indictment says. Bonner is also accused of filing for reimbursement for travel expenses for personal trips, Duffy said. ""Siphoning hundreds of thousands of dollars from hard-working fellow Border Patrol agents, many of whom put their lives on the line every day to protect this country, is a particularly troubling form of corruption that must be addressed,"" Duffy said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The FBI lab has made strides in cutting down its backlog of forensic DNA cases, according to a report released Tuesday by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General. As of March 2012 the backlog stood at 403 cases compared to 3,211 cases two years prior. The report attributed the improvement to increased use of automation, more staff and a focus on using DNA analysis in situations in which it's most likely to yield useful results. The FBI lab tests biological evidence found at crime scenes and items like envelopes, drinking glasses and articles of clothing. The lab does the work for not just the FBI but also for local police departments that don't have forensic labs. FBI, Justice Department reviewing forensic evidence in thousands of cases . The report found the biggest reduction in cases came in the area of nuclear DNA, in which biological fluids like blood and semen are analyzed. There was not as large a drop in the backlog of cases involving mitochondrial DNA, which looks at such things as teeth, hair and highly degraded fragments of bones. According to the inspector general, the FBI decided not to examine samples in 300 of the backlogged mitochondrial DNA cases that came from the FBI's Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center. The report said it had been policy to submit all hairs found on improvised explosive devices. ""The FBI told us that there have been no documented instances for which probative results were generated from these mitochondrial DNA examinations,"" said the report. The FBI changed its policy on analyzing samples from all such cases. The inspector general said a previous report found the FBI lab doesn't have a system to electronically manage lab information and that was still the case as of June. The report said the FBI spent at least $14 million since 2003 on two failed attempts to come up with such a system. The inspector general said the FBI is trying to develop a new system.

"(CNN) -- A story this week by the Associated Press has caused quite a stir, especially among African-Americans, when multiple news outlets ran it with the attention-grabbing headline, ""Some black pastors are telling their flocks to stay home Election Day."" The New York Daily News ran the story, along with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Newsday, and a host of conservative websites such as HotAir and NewsMax. When I first saw the headline, I was stunned, especially knowing the blood that has been shed over the years by African-Americans and others to gain the precious right to vote. I read the more than 1,300-word story by Rachel Zoll, with a contribution from Bill Barrow. The first line was ""Some black clergy see no good presidential choice between a Mormon candidate and one who supports gay marriage, so they are telling their flocks to stay home on Election Day."" Nothing in the story legitimately backed up that first line. Anybody who had read the full article would know that. In reading the piece, Zoll and Barrow quote or mention pastors A.R. Bernard, Jamal Bryant, George Nelson Jr., Floyd James, and Howard-John Wesley, Lin Hill and Dwight McKissic. Politics: Is Obama taking black vote for granted? Not a single one of these pastors was quoted as saying they have or plan to tell their congregations not to vote in the presidential election. Not one. Several expressed misgivings about President Barack Obama's support for same-sex marriage, and others had negative thoughts about Mitt Romney being a Mormon or the effect of his policies on their congregants. One said he hasn't decided whom he will vote for, and McKissic said he'll go fishing on Election Day. But not a one said they were telling their members not to vote. The only time this assertion that pastors are telling their congregations to stay home comes from a quote, lifted from another newspaper. The story quotes Bryant as telling the Washington Informer, ""This is the first time in black church history that I'm aware of that black pastors have encouraged their parishioners not to vote."" The reporters couldn't reach him to ask him about it, but going ahead and using the quote is suspect. The writers provide no specifics, no context, or anything else. Bryant said he was aware of this, not that he knew anyone. This is third-hand reporting. Unless you as a reporter know of specific pastors telling their congregations not to vote, it's wrong to make the assumption. Bryant even tweeted the AP after the story ran: ""WHEN did you contact @jamalhbryant <https://twitter.com/jamalhbryant> in order to get his statement on voting? you need to revisit this & be accurate."" Pastors recommending that their followers stay home on Election Day would be jeopardizing their 501(c)(3) status with the IRS. A pastor can say whom he or she is personally supporting, but directing their congregations not to vote for a candidate would be a violation of federal law. So these news outlets that ran the story could not have read the piece. If they did, they need to explain to their readers why they ran it. When contacted about this story, the AP said it ""stands by the version of the story that we distributed, separate and apart from versions that deviated from our own text."" But I believe AP should thoroughly examine its internal controls because that story has other fundamental problems. It is clear that Zoll and Barrow chose to ignore compelling data that undercuts the article's general thesis. If you look at any polling data, it is clear that African-Americans overwhelmingly are going to vote for Obama. One recent poll says he will get 94% of the black vote. Surely, there are black Christians among that particular group. Can AP explain why this recent polling was missing from this story? Surely the facts could put their story in perspective. Second, the Obama campaign has an extensive faith-based outreach among African-American pastors, and the president has participated in conference calls with them, including one on the day he announced his support for same-sex marriage. Political ticker: Black pastors group launches anti-Obama campaign around gay marriage . Why didn't Zoll or Barrow make mention of that or try to reach out to them? That's Journalism 101. Last, it's nonsensical to quote several black pastors who have misgivings about positions taken by Obama and Romney and conclude that ""African-American Christians waver over vote,"" as the first headline provided by AP said. No, maybe those individuals are wavering, but the evidence is clear that a super-majority of African-Americans, including Christians, are clear as to which candidate they are voting for in November. There is no denying that Obama's same-sex marriage position caused tremendous discussion in the black community, and I have heard from a handful of folks who say that has changed their view of him and dampened their enthusiasm to support him for a second term. But I would never offer up a sweeping claim that it is as widespread as Zoll and Barrow suggest. Some would say this is internal journalism stuff. I disagree. This story has led to editorials blasting black pastors; caused some mentioned in the article to feel obliged to come out and state who they will endorse; and has led to consternation among the general public. Our job in the media is to inform and enlighten, not confuse. Running such a confusing, unsupported story lacking basic context and perspective does not serve the public at all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","AP article caused consternation by asserting black pastors urging flocks not to vote .

"(CNN) -- Virgin Atlantic's outgoing chief executive officer, Steve Ridgway, says the company is flourishing in the industry's ""squeezed middle,"" between low-cost and behemoth airlines. The 60-year-old, who took the helm in 2001 and announced his resignation this week, spoke to CNN about his time with Virgin, which he joined in 1989. Since then, Virgin has expanded from two 747s to 40 long-haul aircraft -- but competition in the industry has also intensified. ""We were completely squeezed at the beginning, and so maybe we've gone from being completely squeezed to being squeezed middle,"" Ridgway told CNN. ""But it's something that makes us flourish.""

"New York (CNN) -- Popular science-fiction author Harry Harrison, whose book ""Make Room! Make Room!"" was the basis for the 1973 film ""Soylent Green,"" about a futuristic society and its fictional food, has died, his publisher said Wednesday. He was 87. Born in 1925 in Stamford, Connecticut, Harrison was best known for his 12 novels about the futuristic character ""Slippery Jim"" DeGriz, also known as the Stainless Steel Rat. Harrison also was the main writer for the ""Flash Gordon"" comic strip during the 1950s and '60s, according to his publisher, Tor Books. Harrison started his career as an illustrator before switching to writing. He is a member of the Science Fiction Hall of Fame.

On learning of his death, fiction author Harlan Ellison said, ""It's a day without stars in it."" Ellison, who says he knew Harrison since 1952, said the author was one of the funniest guys who ever lived. ""Harry was one of those who you thought would go on forever like a wind-up toy,"" Ellison told CNN. Harrison's death comes after notable science fiction author Ray Bradbury passed away in June.

"(Financial Times) -- Three former Olympus executives pleaded guilty on Tuesday to filing false financial reports in connection with a $1.7bn accounting fraud at the Japanese camera company. In the first court proceedings arising from the case, Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, who ran Olympus for a decade as president and later chairman, said he was to blame for the long-running scheme to hide lossmaking investments. ""As the representative director and president, I bear full responsibility,"" he said. Two of Mr Kikukawa's top lieutenants, Hisashi Mori and Hideo Yamada, also pleaded guilty. Olympus has admitted that managers secretly moved more than Y100bn ($1.3bn) of securities-related investment losses off its books beginning in the 1990s, then used acquisitions as cover to square the hidden accounts. Including money that outside financiers kept in return for helping arrange the deception, roughly Y135bn was ""appropriated to maintain the scheme"", a civil investigation commissioned by the company concluded in December. Four financial advisers have also been charged with violating securities laws in the affair, and are to be tried separately from the Olympus executives.

"(CNN) -- Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish has defended his side's decision to wear t-shirts in support of teammate Luis Suarez, despite the striker being found guilty of using racist language by the English Football Association. Suarez was banned for eight matches this week after the FA deemed he had used insulting words to Manchester United defender Patrice Evra, which referenced the color of the Frenchman's skin. However, Suarez denies any wrongdoing and, prior to Wednesday's 0-0 draw at Wigan, his Liverpool teammates backed the Uruguayan international by wearing t-shirts bearing his name. Footballers are TV stars, and should act like it ... This action has prompted criticism on some social media sites, with Dalglish using Friday's press conference for Monday's match against his former club Blackburn to defend his players' actions. ""I don't think the players have caused any trouble with the FA by their t-shirts. If we are not in any trouble we will leave it at that before we do get in any trouble."" Dalglish added: ""Luis has been quite emotional and very grateful for the support. ""I don't think it is ever a disappointment when the people you work for give you their undivided support and I think that is the least he deserves."" The club are still to decide on a possible appeal against Suarez's ban, with Dalglish continuing: ""Most of the people have had their say, we've had our say but we will wait for the judgment and take it from there."" Meanwhile, former Manchester United and Aston Villa defender Paul McGrath has criticized Glen Johnson for wearing the t-shirt. Johnson is the only black player in Liverpool's first team squad and McGrath, speaking on radio station talkSPORT, said: ""If I was in Glen Johnson's situation, I'd have thrown the shirt to the floor. ""If that had been someone in my era, and I'd heard the comments, then I would not wear a t-shirt with his name on it, saying all is well and good here.""

"(EW.com) -- For the first time in Emmy history, not one program nominated for best drama series was from a major broadcast network. Yet Sunday night's 64th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards still managed to attract a slightly larger audience than last year. ABC's telecast delivered 13.2 million viewers, up 6 percent from the 2011 telecast on Fox. Among adults 18-49, however, the show declined 10 percent to a 3.8 rating â€” tying the all-time Emmys low from back in 2008. Though creatively hit-and-miss, producers kept the show on schedule, wrapping at three hours (even if that meant playing off the ""Modern Family"" team and ""Game Change"" winner Julianne Moore to keep things moving). Critics gave high marks to host Jimmy Kimmel's monologue (though not his Botox-punching cold open bathroom skit). Some of the pre-taped sketches, such as re-imagining AMC's ""Breaking Bad"" as ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" also drew laughs. A social media prank where Kimmel encouraged viewers to tweet that Tracy Morgan passed out onstage and tell people to switch on the show seemed to fall flat (looking at the half-hour ratings throughout the telecast, the gimmick didn't seem to spike viewership, either). On the awards front, many of the winners were very predictable, with ABC's ""Modern Family"" taking home the award for best comedy yet again (full winners list). But Showtime's freshman drama ""Homeland"" broke ""Mad Men's"" four-year winning streak for best drama series, while fellow newcomer, FX's ""American Horror Story,"" lost its bid to capture a top category win by aiming for best movie or miniseries.

""The bottom line is that the players from his generation and mine really don't want to have anything to do with him. He did what he did as a player and there are consequences."" Faldo, the record points scorer in Ryder Cup history, was renowned for his single-minded approach as a player -- which won him six major titles but few friends on the course. His first run-in with Azinger came in 1987. After winning his first British Open at Muirfield, Faldo reportedly commented ""Tough luck, old boy"" after the American bogeyed the last two holes on the final day to miss out on the title. They famously halved a Ryder Cup match six years later at The Belfry. ""He talked me into giving him a five-footer on the 16th,"" Azinger told the mail on Sunday. ""He said, 'It's over. You guys have won'. So I waived the putt. Then Davis Love ran over and told me the match was still tied. I can't tell you how irritating that was. ""Then, on the 18th, when America had already won, I needed a 10-footer to win the hole and halve the match. Who gave a rat's ass about our match because the result of the Ryder Cup was already decided? ""I went through the motions of preparing for the putt expecting any second for him to tell me to pick the ball up. It would have been the sporting thing to have done and I couldn't believe it when he said nothing. I holed it, and that gave me so much pleasure. ""I guess I've always felt a rivalry with him, probably more than he has with me. I've got to know him better now but it doesn't change what's happened and, come September at Valhalla, something will have to give."" Faldo and Montgomerie used to be Ryder Cup partners, but the Scot now seems likely to miss out after slipping down the world rankings. ""I hope he plays against us, but I'm worried he won't,"" Azinger told the Mail on Sunday. ""He and Faldo don't seem to get along and there's no way Faldo will award him one of his two wild-cards. I love that dude. We're all scared of him when he plays in the Ryder Cup. ""What he's done is amazing. Monty's become famous for it in the United States and he's never even won a major. Americans don't particularly like him but there's nothing wrong in being the villain. ""He's brought a lot of it on himself, of course. He probably won't ever win a major now, but I still want him in the European team because I want to show him what the taste of defeat is like. I've told him this. I also implored him to give me some stuff I shouldn't know about Faldo. ""Faldo will be a loner as a leader: very thorough, but a loner. I've got three assistants with me and, although people have suggested the players don't need them, they must understand that the assistants are for me, not the players."" Europe will be seeking a fourth successive victory in Louisville, with the U.S. having last won the biennial event on home soil at Brookline in 1999.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The FAA has not effectively implemented a program designed to keep birds and other animals from causing damage to airplanes, according to an audit from the Department of Transportation. The agency did not have robust inspection practices, inspectors did not have expertise in wildlife hazards, and they failed to keep adequate records of inspections, Jeffrey Guzzetti, the assistant inspector general for aviation and special program audits, wrote. Aircraft strike thousands of animals each year. In 2011, there were 9,840 strikes -- nearly 27 a day -- recorded by the FAA, according to the report. The number is five times the number of strikes that were reported in 1990, due in part to increasing bird populations. The results of a collision with wildlife often are minor but they can cause serious problems, including engine failures like those that forced US Airways Flight 1549, the so-called ""Miracle on the Hudson,"" to crash land in the river. Twenty-four people have died in the U.S. and 229 worldwide due to wildlife strikes since 1988, according to the report. About 600,000 hours of aircraft downtime and $625 million in damages are caused each year by the incidents. Next generation of supersonic flight . ""Inspectors we spoke with mostly relied on interviews with airport personnel to determine compliance with regulatory requirements, rather than reviewing strike and airport records,"" the report says. Auditors randomly selected 40 airports and found inspectors at 21 of them ""did not know whether the airports' assessments and plans had been FAA reviewed and approved or whether the airports were even required to conduct an assessment or develop a plan."" Of the 35 airports auditors looked at with FAA wildlife hazard assessment plans, 27 did not comply with at least one requirement despite FAA inspection documents showing they did. Inspectors did not initiate enforcement actions when airports didn't follow the rules 25 times at eight of the airports visited, according to the audit. BA Googles passengers . Many of the policies for reporting and preventing wildlife hazards are voluntary, which the inspector general concluded limits their effectiveness. Auditors found that one airport reported 90% of strikes while another reported only 11%. Overall, only about 21% of strikes in logs at the airports examined were reported to the FAA. ""Without full reporting and complete data on wildlife strikes, it is difficult to fully analyze the magnitude of safety issues, the nature of the problems, and the economic cost of wildlife strikes,"" the report found. The report suggested 10 changes to address the problems found, including mandatory and full reporting requirements as well as performing better inspections and reviews of plans. Airlines shrink legroom in coach . ""It is imperative that FAA improve its management processes by improving oversight and enforcement of program regulations, making strike reporting mandatory, establishing performance metrics, and strengthening coordination with other governmental agencies,"" the audit concluded. Responding to the audit, the FAA agreed with six of the recommendations, but only partially agreed with three, and disagreed with one. Flight returns after engine problem . ""FAA has devoted considerable effort to improving the outcomes from its work with airports and the aviation industry to reduce wildlife related hazards to aviation,"" Clayton Foushee, the FAA's director of audit and evaluation, wrote. The agency rejected the audit's calls for mandatory and full reporting and cited a 2009 report that concluded ""the current level of voluntary strike reporting is sufficient for determining national aircraft strike trends, determining the hazard level of wildlife species involved in aircraft strikes, and for providing a scientific foundation for FAA policies and guidance regarding the mitigation of risk from wildlife strikes."" Top officials among those killed in Sudan crash . The FAA is working to gather data, expand and improve regulations, use technology to track animals, and increase training, raise awareness, he said. ""While wildlife strikes have increased ... the percentage of significant strikes, in which multiple strikes occur simultaneously or in which an air carrier experiences a damaging collisions has decreased markedly, from 20% of total reported strikes in 1990, to 9% in 2010."" ""In our opinion, FAA is missing an opportunity to fully address one of its biggest challenges by not meeting the full intent of these recommendations,"" the audit said. ""Accordingly, we request that the agency reconsider its position.""","About 27 airplanes each day hit an animal .

"(CNN) -- Juventus coach Antonio Conte has failed to overturn a 10-month ban for his role in a match fixing scandal after the Italian Football Federation (FICG) rejected his appeal Wednesday. Conte led Juve to the Serie A title last season but was punished for failing to report alleged corruption in two Serie B matches when he was previously in charge of then second flight Siena. The 43-year-old was handed his suspension on August 10 and appeared in person this week before the disciplinary commission of the FICG at the Federal Court of Justice in Rome to argue his case. But his pleas have been rejected. ""The Federal Court of Justice can confirm the 10-month disqualification for Antonio Conte,"" said a statement on the FICG website. ""It was decided to acquit Conte for his role in the Novara-Siena game, but the 10-month disqualification stands as a disciplinary commission sanction concerning Albinoleffe-Siena."" Conte is the most prominent figure caught up in the so-called 'Calcioscommesse' illegal betting scandal -- largely confined to clubs in the second flight Serie B of Italian football. His suspension leaves Juventus without a coach for the start of their title defense against Parma in Turin Saturday although Conte is allowed to participate on the training ground. Gianni Merlo, the chief sports writer of Gazzetta Dello Sport, told CNN that Juventus would launch a further appeal to the Court of Arbitration of the Italian Olympic Committee next month. ""Juventus has defended him very strongly, the president of Juventus (Andrea Agnelli) has said this is a kind of witchhunt, but he is very inexperienced in these matters,"" he added. Agnelli appointed Conte before the start of last campaign and his first season in charge proved a triumph as the Turin giants swept to the Scudetto for a record 28th time. In their ruling, FICG has shown a measure of clemency to Conte's assistant Angelo Alessio, who saw his ban cut from eight months to six months after he was found guilty of the same offenses at Siena. Lecce's appeal against demotion from Serie B was rejected, but Grosseto were reinstated to the division. The affair has unhappy echoes of the previous match fixing scandal which swept Italian football six years ago and led to Juventus being stripped of two titles and demoted to Serie B. Meanwhile, ahead of the new season a major transfer switch was completed Wednesday with AC Milan and Inter agreeing to swap strikers Giampaolo Pazzini and Antonio Cassano. Milan, who will play in the Champions League this season, have also additionally paid â‚¬7m ($8.73m) to secure Pazzini. Cassano, who battled a heart condition before playing a key role for Italy in Euro 2012 campaign, has signed a two-year deal at Inter. ""Finally, after what seems like an eternity, I've signed for the club I've always supported,"" he told Inter's official website.","Antonio Conte's appeal against a 10-month ban rejected .

"(CNN) -- With its glassy touch screen, powerful graphics, crisp sound and tilt feature, the iPhone is more than a smart phone for some users -- it's a portable entertainment system. ""Trism"" developer Steve Demeter demonstrates his game via webcast to CNN.com's Nicole Lapin. It's also become a potential gold mine for entrepreneurs who create games for the device. Just ask Steve Demeter, developer of the popular puzzle game ""Trism."" A former ATM software designer for a large bank, Demeter created ""Trism"" in his spare time and pitched it to Apple last spring. The company made the game available for download with the July launch of its App Store, an online provider of applications for its iPods and iPhones. Priced at $5, ""Trism"" earned Demeter $250,000 in profits the first two months. ""It's done phenomenal business,"" said Demeter, 29, who lives in the California's San Francisco Bay area. ""I'm very honored that so many people would enjoy my game. I get e-mails from 50-year-old ladies who say, ""I don't play games, but I love Trism.' That's the coolest thing."" It can take dozens of professional developers and millions of dollars to create a video game for a traditional console such as a PlayStation or an Xbox. But the iPhone and the App Store have helped democratize game development by opening the field to any software coder with talent and a clever idea, industry observers say. ""A single one of these titles can be turned around for pennies by comparison in just weeks by a single hobbyist working in their off-hours,"" said Scott Steinberg, publisher of DigitalTrends.com and author of ""Get Rich Playing Games."" ""The overhead and barriers to entry are so low that virtually anyone can afford to take a crack, if not several, at hitting a home run."" Demeter took his crack after attending an iPhone conference in the summer of 2007. He spent months afterward brainstorming, by himself and with friends, about how to create an original game for the device. Once he got the idea for ""Trism"" in February he spent another four months coding the game on nights and weekends. The result is a puzzle game, like ""Bejeweled,"" in which players manipulate a colorful grid of triangles. Players score points by lining up three or more like-colored triangles in a row, with an iPhone twist: The triangles rearrange themselves depending on which way the player rotates the phone. ""I did the game myself, basically. I had a buddy of mine who actually came up with the name 'Trism.' I paid him a couple of grand. But other than that it [was] just me,"" Demeter told CNN. ""It's a very simple-to-learn, hard-to-master puzzle game. It wasn't as hard [to develop] as a 3-D, gun-and-battle kind of game. But for the one-man team that I was, it was definitely a challenge."" Demeter quit his bank job two months ago and has launched a company, Demiforce, to develop more electronic games. Now he has a salaried staff, five games in development and two coming out by Christmas, including a spinoff to ""Trism"" called ""Trismology."" ""Apple has made it so easy to put [game publishing] in the palms of developers,"" he said. ""You just make it and then you submit it to Apple. If you have a relevant, fun game or application, I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be approved."" Developers earn 70 percent of App Store proceeds from the sale of their games, with Apple taking 30 percent. The field is getting crowded, though. There now are more than 1,500 iPhone games available from the App Store, up from about 900 two months ago. ""It's a rich and promising vein that several independent game publishers have been able to successfully tap,"" said DigitalTrends' Steinberg in an e-mail interview. ""However, success stories remain the exception, not the norm -- as with any gold rush, what we're presently seeing is a massive number of prospectors looking to stake their claim. ""Many of the overnight successes we've witnessed enjoyed the benefits of timing and visibility, advantages quickly being eroded due to market oversaturation,"" Steinberg added. ""Let's put it this way: I wouldn't tell anyone to quit their day job just yet. As with any Cinderella story, chances of recreating this kind of success are few and far between.""","The iPhone has become a gold mine for those who create games for the device .

"(CNN) -- Hashim Amla became the first South African to score a triple century in Test cricket as his side dominated No.1 ranked England at The Oval Sunday. Amla was 311 not out as South Africa declared on a massive 637 for two wickets before taking four cheap England wickets by the close of the fourth day. It left England needing 150 runs to avoid a humiliating innings defeat with only six wickets left. Amla shared a record 377 unbroken stand for the third wicket with Jacques Kallis, who was 182 not out when captain Graeme Smith called his men in. The previous Test best for South Africa had come from current teammate AB de Villiers, who hit 278 not out against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in 2010-11. ""I am happy, surprised and really excited that I managed to do something that has never been done before by a South African, but the biggest pleasure is that the team is in a dominant position to win this Test match,"" Amla told gathered reports. ""I didn't dream about getting 300,"" he added. ""I've always been a person who never sets goals. In many ways that helps you because you can keep going without being limited."" Amla batted for just over 13 hours and hit 35 fours, including a boundary off Tim Bresnan when on 299, lofting it over the infield before taking a prolonged standing ovation from the crowd. They had seen England's much-vaunted bowling attack blunted on a docile pitch with Kallis reaching his 43rd Test ton in tandem. England took only one wicket in nearly two days of play, but South Africa's bowlers made significant inroads when the home side batted again. Alastair Cook, who hit a century in the first innings, was caught behind off Vernon Philander off the eighth ball of the innings without scoring. Dale Steyn then quickly removed Jonathan Trott, caught behind off a superb delivery. Kevin Pietersen hit three boundaries in his stay for 16 until being bowled by Morne Morkel. When England captain Andrew Strauss top-edged a sweep against leg-spinner Imran Tahir to go for 27 his side were in deep trouble. Their hopes of avoiding defeat and going one down in a three-Test series will rest with Ian Bell and Ravi Bopara when play resumes Monday.","Hashim Amla hits undefeated triple century in first Test against England .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to managing in the Premier League, time is a rare commodity. For a club like Newcastle, which has had eight different men lead the club over the past six-and-a-half years, the decision to give Alan Pardew an eight-year deal comes as something of a surprise. Pardew replaced Chris Hughton in December 2010 and signed a five-and-a-half year deal at the club, despite a number of supporters being critical of his appointment. Nearly two years later and he can do little wrong, even the sale of former hero Andy Carroll to Liverpool for $57 million failed to dent his popularity too much. Pardew replaces Hughton at Newcastle . The contract is the longest to be handed out in recent times to a manager, although Newcastle did give Kevin Keegan a 10-year deal back in 1994. Keegan lasted just three years on that occasion but the club are hopeful Pardew can continue his good work after being voted as both the Premier League and the League Manager Association's Manager of the Year. The 51-year-old, who led the his team to a fifth place finish in last season's Premier League, has impressed at the club following a number of shrewd signings. Yohan Cabaye, Demba Ba and Papiss Cisse have all made a huge impact after joining the Magpies with the club now aiming to continue challenging for a place in European competition. Owner Mike Ashley is not shy of hiring and firing with Sam Allardyce, Kevin Keegan, Joe Kinnear, Alan Shearer and Chris Hughton all given the boot since he took over the club in the summer of 2007. Now, with a degree of stability, it looks like Newcastle are ready to invest their time and trust in Pardew and his staff. Not only has the club given Pardew a long-term deal, but his entire coaching team have been given similar terms. The club's managing director, Derek Llambias, makes no secret of his desire to bring a carefully planned project to fruition and follow in the footsteps of some of England's most successful clubs. Sir Alex Ferguson remains the current longest-serving manger in the English game after taking over at Old Trafford back in November 1986. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger arrived in north London back in 1996, while David Moyes is into his 11th season at Everton. And Llambias is keen for Newcastle to follow the blueprint set out by the likes of Arsenal and Manchester United. Ba brace rescues point for Newcastle against Everton . He said: ""If you look at clubs like Manchester United and Arsenal, Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger have shown that stability gives you the best platform to achieve success and that is the model we wish to emulate here. ""We are looking to build on the success we had last season and these new contracts are aimed at keeping the club progressing on and off the pitch, as we have done since returning to the Premier League in 2010. ""Alan has done a fantastic job over the last couple of years and has proved what a great Premier League manager he is.

"(CNN) -- The latest chapter in British retail has grocery giant Tesco betting on e-books: it's buying Mobcast, a company that brings books to wireless devices. The deal, worth about $7.15 million (Â£4.5 million), is small for Tesco, which is one of the biggest food retailers in the world. But it's still significant: it marks the next page in Britain's digital transformation. When he co-founded Mobcast five years ago, Tony Lynch, the company's CEO, says books weren't represented on wireless devices beyond offerings from online retailer Amazon.com. ""It was a very valuable hole in the market,"" he says. Now, with Mobcast's more than 100,000 titles and counting, Tesco will allow consumers to buy and read books on an array of devices, from smartphones to e-readers. And it also marks another avenue for the retailer to find out more about its customers - information Tesco can use to fine tune its targeted ads and, ultimately, sell more products. ""Arguably, Tesco has the best data in the world on its customers,"" says Michael Comish, CEO of Tesco Digital Entertainment. He points to a robust retail loyalty program that helps the company keep track of customers' shopping habits. ""They (Tesco) have extensive data about purchase behavior and information about the customers."" Experts say that expanding its digital portfolio will allow Tesco to enhance that consumer data for years to come. ""Getting into the electronic purchase cycle of a family, whether it's for books or something else, gets you in much more regular touch with them than if they were just buying a physical product,"" says Sree Sreenivasan, Chief Digital Officer of Columbia University. ""This makes sense to have a whole digital portfolio."" Comish came to Tesco by way of Blinkbox, another digital player in the Tesco empire. The retailer bought the video-on-demand provider last year. ""Part of Tesco's strategy is to acquire talent,"" he says. Tesco also bought the Internet radio service radio service WE7 earlier this year.","UK grocery giant Tesco is buying Mobcast e-books company for $7.15 million .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri is under increasing pressure following his side's third consecutive Serie A defeat. Allegri, who has been forced to defend his side's wretched run of form, was left facing criticism once again after Udinese inflicted a 2-1 defeat on the Rossoneri. Milan, who also had Cristian Zapata and Kevin Price- Boateng dismissed, fell behind to a Mathias Ranegie goal just before the interval. Stephan El-Shaarawy fired home an equalizer from 25-yards before both Zapata and Prince-Boateng were dismissed. Antonio Di Natale converted a penalty to earn Udinese their first league win of the season and leave Allegri fearing for his job. Milan has won just one league game so far this season following defeats against Atalanta and Sampdoria. It was a bad day for AC's city rivals Inter after it slumped to an embarrassing 2-0 defeat against Siena at the San Siro. Siena, who arrived in Milan bottom of the table, took a 73rd minute lead through Simone Vergassola before Francesco Valiani sealed the win. Sampdoria dropped their first points of the season after being held to a 1-1 draw by Torino at the Stadio Luigi Ferarris. Rolando Bianchi put Torino ahead from the penalty spot before Nicola Pozzi also netted from 12-yards to secure a point. Gian Piero Gaseperini suffered defeat in his first game as manager of Palermo after Atalanta recorded a 1-0 win. The former Inter boss was unable to inspire Palermo to its first victory of the season as Cristian Raimondi's goal gave Atalanta all three points. The game between Cagliari and Roma was called off after the president of the Sardinian club rejected local authority orders to exclude fans from their new stadium.

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States is withholding some of its assistance to Malawi in the wake of claims its government used force against protesters during demonstrations over the government's handling of the economy and other issues, officials said Tuesday. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), a U.S. government agency that provides development assistance to countries that demonstrate a commitment to good governance, said it was halting all operations connected to a $350 million, five-year compact signed with the east African nation in 2007. ""MCC is deeply concerned by recent events in Malawi and is placing an immediate hold on all program operations in order to review its partnership with Malawi, including whether to recommend to its Board of Directors to suspend or terminate its assistance,"" the organization said in a written statement Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Despite all the talk about next-generation gaming consoles, PC gaming is still going strong, and with it, demands for more powerful machines to play those games continue to grow. Titles such as ""Diablo III"" and ""Guild Wars 2"" are drawing legions of players to their computers to play games, pushing the limits of towers and laptops. Razer, a high-performance gaming hardware manufacturer, wants to let gamers skip the tower entirely and go straight to its laptop, pushing its hardware to meet the needs of those players with the newly redesigned Razer Blade. The original Razer Blade was released in August 2011, and while CEO Min-Liang Tan said the laptops were selling so fast the firm couldn't keep them in stock, some gamers wanted more performance from the sleek 17-inch laptop. Tan said his team listened to what players said they liked, and what they didn't, when putting together a new design revealed last week at gaming convention PAX Prime. Externally, the new Blade won't look much different than its predecessor. Less than an inch thick and weighing less than seven pounds due to a lightweight aluminum chassis, the laptop is definitely portable. Inside, the Blade has been beefed up to meet gamers' demands. The performance starts with the third generation of the Intel QuadCore i7 processor, a brand new chip and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660M graphics chips. ""The new Razer Blade is about twice as fast as its predecessor a year ago and right up there with all the traditional gaming laptops,"" Tan said. But more power generates more heat, not a good feature for a laptop. Larger vents and heat pipes will channel more airflow into the unit to cool the components. Tan said the design allows for the top part of the chassis to get hot, but in an area where your hands don't touch. There is a new hybrid hard drive that delivers data three times faster and with double the storage space. The revamped Blade also has reduced fan noise, optimized external speakers and provides three USB 3.0 ports that can recharge your devices even when the system is turned off. The updated laptop will keep the Switchblade User Interface -- a LCD display/touch panel with adaptive keys -- from the earlier model. Several third-party vendors have signed up with Razer to design apps specifically for the Switchblade and gaming. For those gamers who already purchased the gaming laptop, Razer is offering a $500 ""thank you"" toward the purchase of the new Blade. Tan said he really wants people to get excited about what they play their PC games on again. The new Razer Blade lists for $2,499.99. It can be pre-ordered now and is scheduled to ship on September 30.","New Razer Blade laptop is designed with gaming in mind, maker says .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- South Africa's ruling African National Congress denied Tuesday the appeal of its youth leader, Julius Malema, expelling him. ""We have gotten the official word on the appeal, and they have expelled him,"" said Malema's lawyer, Dali Mpofu. ""We will meet with the clients tomorrow to discuss a plan going forward."" The ANC's National Disciplinary Committee of Appeal confirmed the 31-year-old politician's expulsion from the ANC Youth League. ""The NDCA confirms the NDC's finding that the appellant did not accept his finding of guilt and was not capable of rehabilitation,"" the committee said. Malema was banned from participating in party activities this month after he gave a speech critical of President Jacob Zuma. Though he had been suspended from the party in November, he was allowed to attend party meetings during his appeal of the disciplinary committee's ruling. The suspension followed a speech in which Malema suggested that Zuma was running the party in a dictatorial and intolerant way. ""It is under President Zuma that we have seen the youth of the ANC being traumatized, being expelled from their own home,"" Malema said, according to an ANC statement. ""It is under President Zuma we have seen a critical voice being suppressed. We have seen, under President Zuma, democracy being replaced with dictatorship."" The disciplinary panel said the youth leader's remarks represented ""a very serious violation"" of the party's constitution. Malema's suspension angered his supporters. He and the youth league helped propel Zuma to power in 2009. But in recent years, Malema has become one of Zuma's fiercest critics, accusing the administration of failing to improve the lives of the poor. Malema's supporters considered the disciplinary action an attempt to silence the anti-Zuma voice within the ruling party. In December, the ANC is due to elect a new leader who is expected to lead the party into national elections in 2014. Malema had been mentioned as a potential contender for the role. He was suspended for five years after the disciplinary hearing in November but was allowed to appeal. He faced a string of charges, including sowing party division by comparing Zuma to his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, and urging that the government of neighboring Botsawana be toppled. In July, Malema criticized South Africa's vote for a no-fly zone over Libya and accused the government of failing to prioritize the African agenda. ""In the past, we know President Mbeki used to represent that agenda very well,"" Malema was quoted as saying at the time. Malema has also been the subject of a criminal investigation by the national revenue service over allegations that he used his political position to influence the awarding of government tenders.","NEW: Julius Malema ""was not capable of rehabilitation,"" committee says .

""My gang mates were the most influential thing in my life,"" says Fajardo, who joined a gang when he was in sixth grade. ""We were pressured to join."" He's not alone. In the Philippines, teenage membership in urban gangs has surged to an estimated 130,000 in the past 10 years, according to the Preda Foundation, a local human rights charity. ""I thought I'd get stuck in that situation and that my life would never improve,"" recalls Fajardo. ""I would probably be in jail right now, most likely a drug addict -- if I hadn't met Efren."" Efren Peñaflorida, 28, also was bullied by gangs in high school. Today, he offers Filipino youth an alternative to gang membership through education. Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year . ""Gang members are groomed in the slums as early as 9 years old,"" says Peñaflorida. ""They are all victims of poverty."" For the past 12 years, Peñaflorida and his team of teen volunteers have taught basic reading and writing to children living on the streets. Their main tool: A pushcart classroom. Stocked with books, pens, tables and chairs, his Dynamic Teen Company recreates a school setting in unconventional locations such as the cemetery and municipal trash dump. Peñaflorida knows firsthand the adversity faced by these children. Born into a poor family, he lived in a shanty near the city dump site. But he says he refused to allow his circumstances to define his future. ""Instead of being discouraged, I promised myself that I would pursue education,"" he recalls. ""I will strive hard; I will do my best."" In high school, Peñaflorida faced a new set of challenges. Gang activity was rampant; they terrorized the student body, vandalized the school and inducted members by forcing them to rape young girls, he says. ""I felt the social discrimination. I was afraid to walk down the street."" Peñaflorida remembers standing up to a gang leader, refusing to join his gang. That confrontation proved fateful. At 16, he and his friends ""got the idea to divert teenagers like us to be productive,"" he says. He created the Dynamic Teen Company to offer his classmates an outlet to lift up themselves and their community. For Peñaflorida, that meant returning to the slums of his childhood to give kids the education he felt they deserved. ""They need education to be successful in life. It's just giving them what others gave to me,"" he says. Today, children ranging from ages 2 to 14 flock to the pushcart every Saturday to learn reading, writing, arithmetic and English from Peñaflorida and his trained teen volunteers.  Watch Peñaflorida and his group in action with their push cart classroom » . ""Our volunteers serve as an inspiration to other children,"" he says. The group also runs a hygiene clinic, where children can get a bath and learn how to brush their teeth. Since 1997, an estimated 10,000 members have helped teach more than 1,500 children living in the slums. The organization supports its efforts by making and selling crafts and collecting items to recycle.  Take a look at the slums where Peñaflorida and his group spend their Saturdays » . Through his group, Peñaflorida has successfully mentored former gang members, addicts and dropouts, seeing potential where others see problems. ""Before, I really didn't care for my life,"" says Michael Advincula, who started doing drugs when he was 7. ""But then Efren patiently dug me from where I was buried. It was Efren who pushed me to get my life together.""  Watch Advincula describe how he met Peñaflorida in the slums » . Today, Advincula is a senior in high school and one of the group's volunteers. Peñaflorida hopes to expand the pushcart to other areas, giving more children the chance to learn and stay out of gangs. ""I always tell my volunteers that you are the change that you dream and I am the change that I dream. And collectively we are the change that this world needs to be."" Want to get involved?

"(Financial Times) -- Facebook is working with a controversial data company called Datalogix that can track whether people who see ads on the social networking site end up buying those products in stores. Amid growing pressure for the social networking site to prove the value of its advertising, Facebook is gradually wading into new techniques for tracking and using data about users that raise concerns among privacy advocates. ""We kept hearing back [from marketers] that we needed to push further and help them do a better job,"" said Brad Smallwood, Facebook's head of measurement and insights. Datalogix has purchasing data from about 70m American households largely drawn from loyalty cards and programmes at more than 1,000 retailers, including grocers and drug stores. By matching email addresses or other identifying information associated with those cards against emails or information used to establish Facebook accounts, Datalogix can track whether people bought a product in a store after seeing an ad on Facebook. The emails and other identifying information are made anonymous and collected into groups of people who saw an ad and people who did not. Datalogix compiles a report for Facebook and its advertisers to measure which creative approaches and demographic targeting persuade people to buy specific products offline. Facebook said it is paying Datalogix for the data-matching. So far, the two companies have measured 45 campaigns and in 70 per cent of cases, for every dollar a marketer spent on Facebook it earned an additional $3 in incremental sales, Mr Smallwood said. Marketers are eager for more data to see how their Facebook ad campaigns perform, but some said they still are figuring out how to evaluate the new data. Ford said the information was promising, but a spokesman added that it was too early to give a formal opinion."" Some privacy advocates question whether the practice violates the $9.5m settlement Facebook struck with the US Federal Trade Commission over charges that it deceived consumers by not keeping privacy promises. Facebook users are automatically included in the advertising studies conducted with Datalogix, and cannot directly opt out through their Facebook account. Instead, they must go to the Datalogix website, for which Facebook has a link posted in its help centre. Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy group, said this practice does not provide Facebook users with sufficient control over their data or with transparency over how it is being used. ""We don't believe any of this online-offline data should be used without express consumer approval and an opt-in,"" he said. Facebook and Datalogix said individual-level purchasing data were not shared with Facebook or its advertisers. Individual Facebook user data are not shared with advertisers.

"Tehran (CNN) -- Faezeh Hashemi, daughter of former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, has arrived at Iran's notorious Evin prison to begin serving a six month sentence for making anti-government statements, semi-official Fars news agency reported. Hashemi, who was picked up by authorities late Saturday, was arrested last year for taking part in anti-government protests. She was sentenced in January, just before Iran held parliamentary elections. She will be carrying out her sentence in Evin's security unit, a relatively comfortable section of the prison. Her father is a powerful cleric and former parliament speaker. In the past, Rafsanjani has been one of the government's most vocal critics. He served two terms as president from 1989 to 1997, and is still widely believed to be one of the wealthiest and most politically powerful men in Iran. He had long been a staunch critic and bitter political rival of Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Weeks after the 2009 elections, Rafsanjani condemned the regime's violent crackdown against the opposition movement and spoke out for the people's right to peacefully protest in a speech delivered at Tehran's Friday prayers. He later toned down the attacks and made statements of apparent support of the regime and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In March 2011, Rafsanjani was replaced as head of Iran's Assembly of Experts, a powerful committee charged with electing and removing the leader of the Islamic Revolution and supervising his activities.","Faezeh Hashemi Rafsanjani was arrested last year for taking part in anti-government protests .

"(CNN) -- As one of the world's most successful golfers, Ernie Els has got it all. The three-time major winner is famous for his sporting achievements, but he is giving a lot back to the game he loves and the country he cherishes. Not only is his golf foundation now in its 13th year, but Els also contributes to the economy of the Cape region where he grew up, investing in a wine and restaurant business plus an award-winning golf resort that he helped design. And -- inspired by his son -- he has raised millions of dollars for research into autism. The 42-year-old will not be short of local support at this week's Volvo Golf Champions tournament at Fancourt in George. The Ernie Els and Fancourt Foundation was established to help under-privileged kids take up a sport that is unaffordable to most in his native South Africa. ""Having him back home means so much to us,"" says foundation member Kim Daniels. Her colleague Sylvia Masango says the experience and lessons learned from Els and the other coaches and mentors have transformed her life. ""Golf is who I am now. It has helped me to become the person I am,"" she told CNN. ""I don't know where I would be now without golf."" Family background . Els' own sporting ambitions were supported every step of the way by his father Neels, who owned a transport business, and mother Hettie. Known as the ""Big Easy"" for his languid style, he won the U.S. Open at the age of just 24 in 1994 and has been among the game's elite ever since. ""I had golf clubs, golf shoes -- all these things cost a lot of money. The equipment in golf is very expensive. There are a lot of kids in South Africa, and around the world, that have talent. I've seen these kids not make it because of their inability to pay for good equipment,"" he told CNN. ""So they go by the wayside, I've seen it happen. That's why we started the foundation, to get them to really hone their skills."" The foundation's star graduate is 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen, who spent three years on the program and now makes regular visits back to inspire its pupils. ""The gods were smiling on us to have a kid like Louis come to the foundation,"" said a proud Els. ""I feel like that was something I wanted to do because I am so fond of South Africa, so fond of the country and the people. I just felt it was my duty to give something back to the less fortunate."" Oosthuizen is grateful for his time with the foundation and the important lessons learned before bursting onto the golf scene. ""It's very special to have spent three years on the foundation, and it's great what Ernie is doing for the kids,"" he told CNN. Autism foundation . If the foundation is dear to Els' heart, the fund-raising charity he has set up to tackle autism is a real labor of love. His son Ben was diagnosed with the condition when he was four, and Els set himself the goal of establishing a center of excellence for autism that would be at the cutting edge of research and educational therapy, ""something the world has never seen before."" Since going public with his son's problem in 2008, Els has campaigned on behalf of Autism Speaks and used his sporting connections to raise millions of dollars for his Els for Autism Foundation. His dream is coming ever nearer to reality. ""Next year I expect to raise $5 million and almost be ready for breaking ground on the new center,"" he told CNN. Els uprooted his family -- wife Liezl, daughter Samantha and Ben -- from their main home on Wentworth Golf Course in southern England to Florida to get better treatment for his son, who is ""quite severely affected"" by the condition. With his worldwide fame and influence, Els knows that he is in a position to make a real difference in tackling autism. ""I've seen families where three kids have autism. Now that must be one of the hardest things in the world, because just to do your normal everyday stuff would be almost impossible if you don't have extra help,"" he said. ""We have the resources, we have the money to actually cope with it. There are people and families who don't have that, so we want to try to better their lives."" Commercial interests . Els spends the majority of his time based in Palm Beach, but every winter returns to South Africa to check personally on his private and commercial interests. They include a thriving golf course design business and the realization of a dream to build a signature layout in an area of the Cape where he used to hang out with friends and enjoy barbecues on the beach. Oubaai at Herold's Bay is now established, with the 18 holes taking in rugged surroundings near the Indian Ocean. It was voted ""Best Golf Resort in South Africa"" in a 2007 survey. Els has also designed courses on four continents, but his business empire does not end there. Having met his wife on a farm in Stellenbosch, which is famous for its vineyards, he developed a love of the grape and, at the turn of the century, set up Ernie Els Wines. He partnered expert Louis Strydom to develop a range of five red wines, and in 2011 added a white to the collection. Visitors to the area do not have to go far to sample the products, which are on sale at the ""Big Easy Restaurant"" on South Africa's second-oldest road in Stellenbosch. Golfing ambitions . With all these commitments, Els might be expected to slowly slide down the world rankings as he nears the latter stage of his career. But the former No. 1 is still desperate to add to his near 70 victories worldwide and to his majors tally. He failed to win on the U.S PGA Tour in 2011, meaning he missed the season-opening Tournament of Champions in Hawaii, but after playing in South Africa this week he will return to spend the bulk of his season in the United States. ""I want to really concentrate on America and get some wins early on and hopefully get some real confidence going ahead of the first major at Augusta,"" said Els, now ranked 71st. And how long can he continue to play at the top level? ""Well. I don't want it to end now,"" he smiled. ""I'm 42 and in pretty decent shape for a golfer. I want to continue to win tournaments, the desire still burns bright."" Els added: ""Fifty has always been kind of the mark. At 50 you go onto the Seniors Tour and so forth. My good friend Vijay Singh is 48 this year, he's also had a bit of a quiet year, so I feel there's many years left in me. ""There have been guys in their 40s who have won major championships. Mark O'Meara won two majors when he was 42, so there's a lot of hope for us.""","Three-time major champion Ernie Els keeps busy on and off the course .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- International auction houses Sotheby's and Christie's have a history that stretches back to the 18th Century. But a little-known Chinese rival could now pose a threat to their global dominance of the sale of fine art and antiques. China Guardian said last week that it would hold its first auction outside mainland China in Hong Kong on October 7. Although the sale will be conducted in Mandarin Chinese, Yannan Wang, China Guardian's president and director, said the company hoped to target overseas customers. Future auctions will be held in both English and Mandarin. ""We have a very strong base of Chinese collectors and some loyal Western buyers,"" she told CNN in an emailed response to questions. ""Hong Kong is an international city, we expect to see an increase of international collectors,"" she added. Deadbeat art buyers on the rise in China . China's art market has boomed in recent years as the country's newly affluent look to collect their own art and heritage. According to the website Artprice, Chinese painters Qi Baishi and Zhang Daqian now outsell Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso at auction. China Guardian has been holding sales in mainland China since 1994 and according to French auction body Conseil des Ventes now ranks as world's fourth largest. Another Chinese auctioneer, Beijing Poly, ranks third after Christie's and Sotheby's. The Hong Kong auction, which will feature ink paintings, calligraphy and classical Chinese furniture, marks the first time a Chinese auction house will compete with Sotheby's and Christie's on their home turf. Chinese law prohibits foreign auction houses from auctioning cultural relics in China but Sotheby's and Christie's hold regular auctions of Chinese art and artifacts in Hong Kong, London and New York.","Chinese auction house to hold first sale outside China .

"La Puente, California (CNN) -- Two of three California students who allege they were hazed and sexually assaulted as an initiation into a high school soccer team spoke this week in graphic detail about the harrowing ordeal they said they survived. ""They picked me up and put the stick up my butt,"" a 14-year-old boy, identified only as ""Billy,"" told HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky on Monday. The attackers were his teammates, the teen said. And the allegations the three alleged victims have made are being investigated by authorities and have shocked many around the Los Angeles-area high school. ""This is deeply disturbing to me and the entire community,"" said Barbara Nakaoka, superintendent of Hacienda La Puente Unified School District. ""We do not and will not turn a blind eye to reports of harassment or hazing."" Billy and another boy, 15-year-old ""John,"" told Pinsky that the alleged incidents occurred at the end of last school year at La Puente High School. In both cases, ""Billy"" and ""John"" are not the boys' real names. CNN agreed to use the assumed names to protect the boys' identities. Billy said he was cornered in a back room by a group of about 10 boys who asked him ""if I wanted it the easy way or the hard way. And in that moment my heart was, like, pounding, and, like, I kind of like blacked out."" He tried to run. He tried to fight. The attackers were still able to penetrate him with a pole, Billy said. ""I couldn't, like, get away from all of them. There was, like, 10 people,"" he said. John, another alleged victim, says the coach of the soccer team was aware of the abuse. The coach even winked at him when teammates tried to lure him into the room where the alleged abuse occurred. And when it happened, the coach had to know because his office was very close, John told Pinsky. ""I'm pretty sure he could hear us screaming and kicking in there. And he's just right next to it,"" John said. The soccer coach is under investigation for possible involvement, said Sgt. Dan Scott, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Special Victims Unit. He said authorities conducted interviews with more than 70 boys at the high school, but noted that the investigation is ongoing. Nakaoka said the coach, whom she declined to identify, has been placed on administrative leave. Attempts by CNN to reach the man listed as the team's coach for comment were unsuccessful. Sheriff's officials were notified of the accusations about two weeks ago, following a complaint from the mother of one of the alleged victims. ""We are looking at all sports because the allegations of assault occurred over a few years, and there are multiple allegations,"" Scott said. Four people were cited and could face charges, pending a review by the Los Angeles district attorney, Scott said. Three of the four are minors, and one has since turned 18, he added. He did not identify them. Parents arrived on campus Monday to vent their frustration and demand answers. They displayed signs and banners, calling for school officials to be held accountable if the allegations prove true. Manuel Maldonado, a father, questioned why parents weren't notified earlier about the alleged abuse. ""Where was the supervision?"" he demanded. Brian Claypool, the attorney for the alleged victims, said Monday he has not reviewed any medical records or other potential physical evidence, but insists their stories are credible and consistent. John said he was able to escape, to run away before he got the worst of what his attackers were planning for him. But still the effects linger, and he says he does not want to return to school. ""They're just making fun of me and everything,"" he said. Tennessee fraternity suspended after alcohol enemas incident .

"(CNNGo) -- This summer, London, understandably, is mostly concerned with heart and nerve and sinew. The fittest, leanest, most Lycra-becoming humans alive today are to compete in the London 2012 Olympics and millions of mortals will watch with awe, excitement and possibly a little envy. And Usain Bolt will earn more fame, fortune and adulation in 10 seconds than most of us earn in a lifetime. But there is culture of a different kind to be found too -- in the form of London's World Heritage Sites. These UNESCO-endorsed sites have been around for decades, even centuries, and this July and August could just be the perfect time to see them. Tea time in London: 3 modern teahouses . 1. Tower of London . Ever wondered what it would have been like to be strapped to the rack? See the dreaded machine in the Bloody Tower at the Tower of London and learn about various forms of torture used during the reigns of Henry VIII, Elizabeth I and Mary I. From St. Thomas' Tower, where the monarch's barge was moored, walk along the south wall for a view across the river to Tower Bridge. Down in the courtyard the resident ravens are kept in their enclosure. Legend has it that the Tower will fall if the six ravens ever leave, so seven are kept, providing one spare. Some exhibits are interactive -- visiting school children enjoy putting on the helmets in the White Tower's armory. But these are attached to chains, so there's no taking them home. This is where it all began, with William the Conqueror constructing a fortress here in the 11th century. The massive White Tower provided a haven in case the newly conquered English rebelled. Fortifications were added by successive English monarchs, who also used the Tower as a prison. The Crown Jewels are on display in the Jewel House, from diamonds to maces and crowns, the heaviest of which is the 2.23-kilo, solid gold St. Edward's crown made in 1661. To brush up for that trivia quiz, the biggest, brightest and best are listed online. www.hrp.org.uk . CNNGo.com: Ultimate guide to the Olympics . 2. Westminster Abbey . We've seen it on television for Princess Diana's funeral and the wedding of William and Kate, but no visitor to London should miss stepping inside Westminster Abbey. History tours are led by a verger, one of the laymen assisting in the church. King Edward, later St. Edward the Confessor, built a stone church here. Consecrated in 1065, it saw William the Conqueror crowned there a year later, as England's monarchs have been ever since. In the 13th century Henry III rebuilt the church in the Gothic style we see today. His burial here in 1272 established a royal tradition that lasted 500 years. Many famous people have been laid to rest in the Abbey, from Charles Darwin and Sir Isaac Newton to those in Poets' Corner like Geoffrey Chaucer, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Charles Dickens and Robert Burns. In the Nave we pay our respects at the grave of the Unknown Warrior. Other highlights include the 709-year-old wooden Coronation Chair and the marble pavement in front of the High Altar, decorated in 1268 by the Cosmati method of inlaying small pieces of colored marble into a plain background. At the shrine of St. Edward the Confessor, steps at the base have been worn away by the knees of visitors. Visitors can inspect the adjacent medieval St. Margaret's Church at their leisure. www.westminster-abbey.org . CNNGo.com: Asia's unseen UNESCO World Heritage sites . 3. Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew . While most people know Sir Joseph Banks as the botanist who accompanied Captain James Cook on his voyage to the South Seas, which also took in the continent of Australia, many might not be aware of Banks' accomplishments on returning to England. After he took over as head of the botanic garden at Kew in 1773 its international reputation grew, with researchers bringing botanic specimens from as far afield as India, Africa, China and Australia. That tradition continues today with a scientific program aimed at saving threatened species. Plants from all over the world are preserved in climate-controlled atmospheres and this history of botanical achievement is a prime reason for the World Heritage listing. The other reason is that its landscaped gardens and associated architecture represent developments that were to have an influence throughout the world. Two massive iron-framed glasshouses, the Palm House and Temperate House, dating from the 19th century, became impressive models for conservatories around the world. Also included among 44 listed buildings is Kew Palace, formerly home to King George III. For something modern there's the Rhizotron and Xstrata Treetop Walkway, opened in 2008. Designed by Marks Barfield Architects, renowned for the London Eye, this 18-meter-high, 200-meter-long walkway takes visitors around the crowns of lime, sweet chestnut and oak trees. www.kew.org . 4. Palace of Westminster . After passing through airport-style security, the tour of the Palace of Westminster, which houses the British Parliament, begins in the 11th-century Westminster Hall. This hall has the largest clear-span medieval roof in England. There's the Queen's Robing Room, where the monarch dons her official robes and crown for the annual Opening of Parliament. Paintings of King Arthur and his knights adorn the walls. Bill Gates, Michael Jackson and Michelle Obama have stood in the Royal Gallery, where in 1984 French president FranÃ§ois Mitterrand delivered a speech between frescoes of British victories at Trafalgar and Waterloo. In the House of Lords Chamber there's a spot where civil servants sit, writing answers for questions put to Ministers. Standing at the dispatch box in the House of Commons chamber visitors get to play the role of prime minister. On view in St. Stephen's Hall is the statue to which Emily Pankhurst chained herself during the suffragettes' protest movement. Back in Westminster Hall, the guide indicates the dreaded King's Chair, where Charles I, William Wallace (Braveheart) and Guy Fawkes were tried and condemned. Leaving the palace, statues of republican warrior Oliver Cromwell and crusader-king Richard the Lionhearted bring to mind the tortuous history Britain has endured to gain a democratic parliament that sits in a once-royal palace. www.parliament.uk .

Also at the Royal Observatory is the Prime Meridian, establishing the world's settings for longitude. Located by the Thames in southeast London, Maritime Greenwich boasts more than the observatory, however. ""The ensemble of buildings at Greenwich ... symbolize English artistic and scientific endeavour in the 17th and 18th centuries,"" the UNESCO listing reads. Architectural highlights include the Queen's House, the first true Renaissance building in Britain, and Sir Christopher Wren's beautiful baroque buildings, especially the twin domes of the Painted Hall and Chapel of Saints Peter and Paul, part of the Old Royal Naval College. The National Maritime Museum features a wave tank for experiments, toy boats illustrating maritime history and until September 30, a small exhibition focusing on personal stories of survivors of the Titanic. Something special is the Cutty Sark. Built in 1869 and ""re-launched"" last April following extensive repairs in the wake of a fire in 2007, she is said to be the ""last surviving tea clipper and the fastest and greatest of her time.""

"Sumatra, Indonesia (CNN) -- A loud crack echoes throughout the canopy as two young orangutans come tumbling down, grasping at branches along the way to break their fall. They recover and sheepishly scamper back up. This is lesson one of jungle school here in the forests of central Sumatra, one of the few places where orangutans are being successfully rehabilitated into the wild. ""They have to learn that their whole environment is completely different from the cage,"" says Peter Pratje of the Frankfurt Zoological Society. ""They have to learn that branches and small trees -- the size of bars in the cage -- don't carry them any longer. They bend and break."" ""During the first phase of this jungle training, they are very often falling out of the trees because they use rotten branches."" The two youngsters swing awkwardly between the trees. On the ground below, their trainers keep a watchful eye and try to coax them toward fruit trees. Learning to forage is another crucial lesson in survival. Back in the massive enclosure, the orangutans undergo enrichment exercises to keep their minds occupied and prolong their feeding time. Success here is critical. Scientists say the Sumatran orangutan will be the first great ape to go extinct. ""The orangutan is an extremely vulnerable species because they have a very slow breeding cycle. Usually an orangutan stays for around 7 to 9 years with its mother,"" Pratje says. ""Besides natural mortality, if there is only a little increase in mortality over a longer time already it drives an orangutan population to extinction."" The numbers of Sumatran orangutans have already dwindled to around  6,000. The main reason for that is habitat destruction. Sumatra has lost 85 percent of its natural forest, mainly due to palm oil and pulp and paper companies, scientists say. The sanctuary, a Frankfurt Zoological Project, is just outside the Bukit Tigapuluh National Park. The lowlands surrounding it are an ideal habitat for orangutans, and it's where those that have been released are choosing to build their habitats. According to the environmental group WWF, it's also home to the endangered Sumatran elephant and a quarter of the critically endangered Sumatran tigers left in the wild. But the area, which is not currently protected, is being threatened by pulp and paper companies that want to see the region turned into plantations. So far the government has rejected logging permits, but unless this is declared a conservation area, Pratje and other conservationists fear that could change. So far, more than 100 orangutans have been released here, with just over a dozen more in various stages of training. Pratje has lived here since he established the sanctuary seven years ago, dedicating his entire life to this project. ""It's like fighting for a member of my family,"" he says. ""I love them because they are smart, smarter than other great apes."" But he says the fight is not just about the extinction of a species. The orangutan has become the ambassador for the threatened rainforest. ""If we sacrifice these forests, we may sacrifice our chances for getting medicine for important diseases,"" he says. ""The problem is there is no second chance. If you shut down an ecosystem that is hundreds of years old, you can't regrow it any longer. ""So this is the last chance.""","Peter Pratje says orangutans in Sumatra are threatened by pulp and paper companies .

"(CNN) -- While many teenagers will be focusing on opening presents and eating turkey, this Christmas Day Jessica Watson will be poring over weather maps. After circumnavigating the globe by herself at the age of just 16, it would be easy to presume that a 628-nautical-mile race would not faze the sailor. But the Australian teen is not taking any chances when she enters the Rolex Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, beginning on December 26. Now aged 18, Watson will skipper the youngest-ever crew in the ocean race. ""We've ticked all the boxes"", says Watson. ""This last week is all about keeping your cool."" Watson became the youngest person ever to sail around the world non-stop and unassisted last year. Her 23,000-nautical-mile journey came to an end in Sydney Harbor amid much fanfare. Thousands of people lined the foreshore to greet her, leisure boats sailed through the heads alongside her and she was officially welcomed home by the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Sydney: Making the most of Australia's 'harbor city' It is in the same harbor where the celebrations took place that the Rolex Sydney to Hobart will start next week. Watson will skipper ""Another Challenge,"" one of 89 boats in the fleet this year. ""Round-the-world is all about slow and steady and keeping your head together for the 200-plus days,"" says Watson. This race provides a completely different challenge of leading a team, where the average age is only 19. With all competitors required to be aged 18 and over, Watson only just qualifies. ""We learned a lot in the practice run -- it's all about communicating. When the communication goes well, we sail really well,"" she says. The crew of 10 -- four women and six men -- comes from both sides of the globe, with its members a mix of the best young talent from Australia and Britain. Despite their age Watson insists they have the experience, with two already having competed in the event previously. Some of the crew come from racing backgrounds and the skipper says others have clocked up a huge amount of offshore miles in their relatively short lives. But Watson is under no illusion about how challenging the race can be. The course takes the fleet down the south-east coast of Australia and across the treacherous Tasman Sea. The conditions are notoriously demanding. In 1998 six crew lost their lives at sea when rough weather hit. ""Our number-one goal is to finish the race,"" Watson says. The sailor is well aware of the race's reputation of being tough. ""You train for these sorts of things,"" she adds. ""We've done endless amounts of overboard drills."" Volvo Ocean Race: Conquering the 'Everest of sailing' Watson and her crew have been in intensive training for the race since October. For six days a week they have combined fitness work with on-the-water training. Watson says sailing down to Hobart and back last month gave them the confidence they need going into the race. ""We had quite a lot of tough conditions, which we wanted, and everyone held up well."" All eyes will be on the record-holding supermaxi ""Wild Oates XI,"" vying for her sixth title, to take line honors. However, Watson's presence ensures ""Another Challenge"" will also be one of the yachts that will be closely monitored by the sporting world as she heads down the coast. The young crew will be competing in the Sydney 38 class, and while their main aim is to finish the event, they are well aware that it is a race. ""It's tough but we are hoping to be as competitive as possible, we've put the hard yards in,"" says Watson. The final touches of their preparations will be made on Sunday, Christmas Day, when Watson and her crew will join the competitors for the traditional barbeque lunch at the yacht club. It may not be a normal Christmas for the average teenager, but for someone who has spent most of her 18 years on the water, Watson gives the impression she wouldn't have it any other way.","Jessica Watson will skipper the youngest ever crew in this year's Rolex Sydney to Hobart .

"(CNN) -- Four months ago Raya Al Habsi didn't know how to swim and was a complete sailing novice. Yet Al Habsi is set to become one of the first professional women sailors in the sultanate of Oman. Al Habsi is one of 30 women being trained as part of a scheme to create a new generation of female sailors and boost the country's Olympic chances. The women were chosen in July to take part in the program --which started in October-- and will see them qualify as sailing instructors after an intensive six-month training course. For Al Habsi, it has been a life-changing event. ""I didn't know anything about sailing, just what I have watched on TV,"" she says. ""I was a complete beginner."" ""What I enjoy the most is how every single day we learn something new. It is a breath of fresh air... Oman is such a great place to sail. And I absolutely love racing with my colleagues."" An insight into the extreme series . Before winning a place on the programme, Al Habsi had recently graduated from a degree in business management. But she was looking for a change and for a career that was unique. She says she found that in the Oman Sail program for women. ""Life has changed a lot since I joined,"" says Al Habsi. ""We start the day laughing and singing and having lots of fun in the bus on our way to sailing school. ""Our daily work schedule differs on a weekly basis. (It) includes theory and practical lessons that help the development of our personal and professional skills."" It's a pioneering project in Oman, where women have only been able to work since the mid-1990s. Women are now being encouraged by the country's ruler, Sultan Qaboos bin Said, to engage in a range of areas, such as politics and now sailing. Since launching three years ago, Oman Sail has taken nearly 6,000 Omani children sailing, over half of whom have been girls. Young women were recruited into its sailing centers at Mussanah and Marina Bandar Al Rowdha in July, where they underwent training. Al Habsi says, ""We continue the day in developing our fitness levels by swimming, kayaking and, of course, sailing. Sometimes I feel like I'm on a trip with my colleagues. I do not feel tired or bored after a long day of work."" ""We have (been) allowed a golden opportunity for women to go into this field of sailing,"" she says. ""A new challenging field has been introduced for women to take upon the challenge of sailing and represent their country in international venues."" Double Olympic sailing gold medalist and CNN Mainsail host Shirley Robertson is a mentor on the program. ""When I first went to the marina in July some of these girls didn't know how to swim. ""Some had only seen the sea a few times in their lives. We saw girls sail before but it was hard to retain them in the sport as they grew older because there were no women instructors."" Considering that many of these women had little experience prior to starting the program, the experience has not been without trials. Robertson adds, ""The journey is amazing. They don't just have to learn to sail. Some have to learn to swim first. At the beginning their fitness levels were low and after the first few weeks they were wrecked... But these girls are thirsty for knowledge."" Robertson explains that is was an ambitious project that intrigued her from the beginning but she was unsure at first if the organizers would be able to pull it off. ""Oman Sail had to build a pathway and the building blocks had to be laid down right... But they got stuck in. The project has been blessed by the Sultan and Oman Sail has a good reputation in the country so family members feel more comfortable allowing girls to being involved."" The fact that the project has received a royal blessing is extremely important in the sultanate of Oman. Qaboos bin Said is widely recognized as a reformer in a region where women's rights have traditionally been overlooked. Since coming to power, he has pushed for gender equality in many sectors including politics and education. Al Habsi points out, ""His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said has always emphasized on giving opportunities for Omani women to work in all possible fields shoulder-to-shoulder with their male colleagues."" Robertson adds, ""Things in Oman are changing. The Sultan embraces women. There's equal education and an Omani Women's Day which was an initiative of the Sultan."" And while the government has been pushing for an integration of genders, families also need to agree with the project or it is doomed to fail. The family unit is an important institution of many nations like Oman. Robertson says, ""Families are brave to have the love, support and trust to let the women do this. If it's going to work, the whole family has to buy in, especially the men.

"(CNN) -- Sydney is known around the world for its spectacular beauty and relaxed cosmopolitan lifestyle. The Australian city's waterways are its premier attraction with stunning beaches and a magnificent harbor. Next week all eyes will turn to the sea for a grueling sporting event -- the 'Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race'. On Boxing Day, a fleet of 89 yachts will take part this year in the 628 nautical mile journey down the eastern Australian coast. As the competitors put in their final preparations, find out how to make the most of Sydney's lavish waterways. SEE.. .. the start of the Sydney to Hobart . Sydney Harbor is the focal point for many of the city's celebrations whether it is for New Year's Eve fireworks or Australia Day ferry races. But another that's not to be missed is the start of the 'Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race'. Tens of thousands of leisure boats of all sizes follow the fleet out of the harbor and through the headlands. But if you're not lucky enough to be on the water for the starting gun, you can still take part, by joining the hundreds of thousands of people who head to the foreshore in the city's eastern and northern suburbs. .. a show at the Sydney Theatre Company . With Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett and her director-husband Andrew Upton as its artistic directors, you're guaranteed to see a quality production here. Its location is equally as spectacular as the performances, with the company based at The Wharf on the harbor in Walsh Bay. .. animals with an impressive view . At Taronga Zoo, the inhabitants enjoy some of the best real estate in the city. Giraffes have uninterrupted views of the harbor bridge and birds look on to the Opera House. But it's not just for the animals to enjoy; Taronga Zoo is worth a visit for anyone wanting to get close to some wildlife without leaving the city. .. some free entertainment . Every January the Sydney Festival kicks off with a range of activities to entertain from music gigs to circus acts dotted around the city. On the first night in particular there are many free events for people of all ages. DO .. .. a tour of the Opera House . 'The Sydney Opera House', sitting on the harbor's edge, is the city's most iconic building. The best place to view this amazing feat of architecture is from the water, but it's just as impressive on the inside as it is out. 'The House' is home to operas, ballet, orchestral performances and even rock concerts. Backstage tours are available for those keen to see how they are all put together. .. the Harbor Bridge climb . 'The coathanger' as it is affectionately known is a major roadway connecting Sydney's east and north. However the bridge has become more than just a thoroughfare, it is a symbol of the city. You can climb over the bridge with experienced leaders guiding you the way. Most people recommend going at dusk or dawn to witness the most amazing skyline. .. the Bondi to Bronte walk . Ask any Sydneysider where they would take a visitor and this would be it. The coastal walk stretches for about four kilometers between the two beautiful white sandy beaches. It takes you along the cliff tops, darting in and out of smaller eastern suburb beaches. In the spring you can take in some art at the same time with the free exhibition 'Sculptures by the Sea'. .. take a dip in the Pacific . No visit to Sydney is complete without a swim in the ocean. Sydney is packed with beautiful beaches or swimming spots. Drop an anchor at Nielsen Park and dive off your boat in this charming harbor inlet or go for a surf at one of the city beaches such as Manly in the north or Tamarama in the east.

Known for its famous fish and chips, this century-old restaurant has been run by the same family for five generations. .. with the rich and famous . Woolloomooloo Wharf in the inner-city is the best place to spot a celeb in Sydney. The historic finger wharf has been turned into a luxury hotel and apartments, with some of the city's finest restaurants located within. Diners can enjoy opulent meals at one of the eateries, such as 'Otto Ristorante' or 'China Doll,' while taking in the city skyline and watching magnificent yachts moor at the wharf. .. where you can be seen . Tourists mingle among the glamor set at Australia's most famous beach, Bondi. 'North Bondi Italian' is a stylish restaurant located just meters from the sand.

This servicemen's social club is open to visitors and has the same stunning views as its more sophisticated neighbor. .. a picnic on the foreshore . There's no better way to appreciate Sydney's stunning harbor and beaches than making up a picnic and hitting the water. Take your boat to Sydney's Fish Markets and stock up on some fresh seafood before sailing along the harbor. If you want to get some sand in your toes at the same time, you can pick up some takeaway from 'The Bathers Pavilion' at Balmoral Beach and soak in the tranquil atmosphere with a few gourmet treats. DRINK . .. beer with the best view . Sydney's historic Rocks precinct is in the shadows of the Harbor Bridge. Located in the heart of it is 'The Glenmore Hotel'. This rustic pub is a true reflection of Australia's English colonial past. While the watering hole looks like many others in the area, it's the pub's rooftop, with views of the 'The Sydney Opera House' and bridge, which sets it apart. .. wine in a back alley . Sydney's newly relaxed licensing laws have seen sophisticated wine bars pop up all over the city. The small and inviting 'Love Tilly Devine' in the inner city suburb of Darlinghurst is tricky to find, even for locals.

"(Lonely Planet) -- The world's second-largest country has a massive Atlantic coastline, and the best way to tackle its awesomeness is by car or campervan. The landscape varies from sheltered coves of pine-covered offshore islands to high rock cliffs battered by waves and wind, and usually fronted by reams of grey-blue ocean. Head to the west coast of Nova Scotia and around to New Brunswick to visit the Bay of Fundy where the highest tides on the planet create sienna silt shorelines that change by the minute with the incoming or retreating waters. Wherever you go you'll find storybook lighthouses, bucolic villages of white-picket homesteads and extremely friendly folk. The region is tied together by well-maintained roads where you can choose to take scenic country routes for leisurely exploration, or straight highways to cut down travel times. Good, clean campgrounds with RV hook-ups are everywhere or shack up at ubiquitous B&Bs. Lonely Planet: British Columbia's capital charms . Where to go . The obvious starting point for a road trip on Canada's east coast is Halifax, Nova Scotia, a hub of live music pubs, summer festivals and historic architecture. Three days . Head west on HWY 3 stopping in at photo darling Peggy's Cove. The highlight here is a near-perfect lighthouse perched on a billow of bare granite boulders with crashing waves below. Take free tours on the local history and geology with the tourist office, or wander independently past fishermen's houses on stilts, cluttered by crab traps. From here the coast winds around inlets of evergreen islands until you reach historic Chester, which is known for the artists' studios along its minuscule main street. Soon after Chester is larger Mahone Bay, the sunniest town on the coast. Browse small craft shops in colorful 19th-century buildings or rent sea kayaks to trip around the 100 or so islands in the bay. Lastly, stop at Lunenburg, the province's only UNESCO World Heritage Site, know for its distinctive 18th- and 19th-century architecture. Take a sailing cruise, hire bikes to tour the beaches of the peninsula, hop in a horse carriage to tour the town or just wander around the antique streets to see what you'll find. Lonely Planet: Canada: 10 amazing adventures . One week . Follow the three-day itinerary then cross over to Wolfville and the Bay of Fundy via HWY 12. Spend a day crisscrossing the country roads and grassy hills of Cape Blomidon to catch some of the most dramatic views of the Fundy tides. The next day, drive east, stopping at wineries and shopping for unique jams, mustards and relishes at Tangled Garden (on HWY 1 near Grand Pre), where you can also cool down with a herb-flavored ice cream. Drive through mazes of rural roads and maybe get lost on the way to Maitland to sign up for a day of rafting the tidal bore in an inflatable dingy -- depending on the phase of the moon this can be relaxing or one of the most adrenalin-charged experiences of your life. On the last day head back to Halifax via east coast Martinique Beach, one of the longest beaches in Nova Scotia, a beautiful place for stretching legs and bird watching. Two weeks . With more time you can go directly up to Cape Breton, along the circuitous roads of the 'Cabot Trail', over high sea vista points, where whales breach offshore and you have to watch for moose on the road. Those with more time can get the overnight car ferry to Newfoundland and continue on the 'Viking Trail' that links the fjord-filled Gros Morne National Park with Leif Eriksson's historic Viking settlement, L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site. When to go . Outside of June to October the coast will be fiercely cold and most businesses will be shut. Where to stay . • Lennox Inn 1791 (Lunenburg): Canada's oldest continually operating inn. • The Olde Lantern Inn & Vineyard (Grand Pre): in the heart of winery and Fundy tide country.

"(CNN) -- The NBA is without a Chinese-born player for the first time in 12 years, after it was announced Yi Jianlian has signed a one-year deal in his homeland. Yi failed to earn a new contract with 2011 NBA champions Dallas Mavericks, and he has returned to China to join former team Guangdong Tigers. ""It's a huge pity to spend his prime years on the bench in the NBA without being trusted,"" Guangdong general manager Liu Hongjiang said of Yi in a statement. ""He wants to play and we can provide an ideal stage."" Yi carried the flag for China at the recent London 2012 Olympics, his third appearance at the Games. His departure is a blow the league, which is looking to take advantage of the potentially lucrative Asian market. Current NBA star Dwayne Wade, a champion with Miami Heat earlier this year, told CNN that basketball still trails football as the world's favorite sport. The popularity of the NBA in China skyrocketed when center Yao Ming joined the Houston Rockets in 2002. The first Chinese-born player to take to the court in the NBA was Wang Zhizhi, who made history by joining the Mavericks in 2001. The NBA's profile in Asia has been boosted by the emergence of Jeremy Lin, a Taiwanese American who shot to global fame with a string of standout performances for the New York Knicks during the 2011-12 season.

"(TIME.com) -- As the assistant chef and the senior policy adviser for healthy-food initiatives at the White House, Sam Kass knows how to fill a plate to the first lady's approval. Recently, we caught up with Kass at Google's annual Think Health summit, where he spoke to health care leaders and innovators about his work with Michelle Obama on her Let's Move initiative to curb childhood obesity. So far, Kass said, the campaign has overhauled school lunches, replaced the government's food pyramid with the more consumer-friendly MyPlate, and encouraged pediatricians to write prescriptions for more fruits and veggies. ""Yet we've only scratched the surface of what's possible,"" he said. We asked Kass about everything, from what the United States is doing right in terms of healthy eating to what he's growing in the White House garden this season. What do you think has been the greatest breakthrough for the Let's Move campaign so far? There isn't one magic bullet for what's having the greatest impact -- there are all kinds of things we are doing and will continue to do. But I think what's really important is that we have unified the country around health. You believe we will see the greatest changes to national health when young kids start making healthy eating decisions for themselves. Are we seeing this transition yet? I see this all the time. We recently had the first ever Kids' State Dinner. There was china, butler service, the President and first lady were there -- the whole nine yards. It was amazing. Now these kids have gone back to their schools and communities and they're heroes. Why? Because they cooked some vegetables in a creative way and they used whole grains to make healthy dishes. They've started owning this for themselves, and it's what makes them great. We start seeing this everywhere, and that's what gives me great hope that we are really going to turn this around. TIME.com: Can laws against junk food in schools rein in child obesity? What are some of the simplest changes American families can make to their diets? There are a lot of little things that can be done. It's the first lady's experience that little changes can have huge impact. If families just filled half their plate with fruits and vegetables at dinnertime, it would have a transformative impact on their health. If we drank more water and low-fat dairy and nonsugary drinks, that would also have a transformative impact. Really any of the seven MyPlate tips, if we did any of those, we would really have a great impact. Sometimes it feels overwhelming. It feels like these problems are just so big, but in the end, the solutions can be quite small, approachable and doable. I think it's important to remember that. We need to break through and make sure parents have that kind of information they need and we can deliver it to them in ways that are useful. You trained under chef Christian Domschitz in Vienna. What can we learn from the way people eat abroad? I think there's a tremendous amount that we can all learn from the world. People are learning from us. American chefs are some of the greatest chefs in the world now. But of course we always have more to learn. I think what I've seen (abroad) is a love and care for food and the quality of ingredients. There's care taken in making sure people have time to prepare them properly with good portion sizes. TIME.com: Disney's diet: No more junk-food ads on kids channels . What are you growing in the White House garden right now? We are just ending summer and moving into fall, so we are just picking our last watermelons. Our tomatoes are still doing great. We have a lot of peppers, our zucchinis and yellow squash are just finishing up. We have a bunch of beans right now. And of course, pumpkins. We have the best pumpkin harvest of our time here by quite a lot. We will have a fun Halloween. What are some of the favorite meals in the White House? That's top-secret information. We balance. The first lady practices what she preaches, which is moderation. When we put out the MyPlate guide, she came in and said, ""We're cooking the MyPlate."" That's what we're doing. What she's always said to her kids, and throughout the Let's Move campaign, is that if we're eating balanced all the time, then when we go to a party and have pizza or cake, it's no problem. We all love fries and burgers and all that stuff. But we just can't have it day in and day out. That's when we run into trouble. What did you have this morning for breakfast? Today the Google team provided a healthy breakfast. In line with MyPlate, I had granola with low-fat yogurt and fruit. I'm also a big oatmeal guy. Oatmeal and bananas are pretty standard for me.

"(CNN) -- Police on Friday arrested a former Massachusetts chemist accused of lying about drug evidence she handled while working at a state police lab, which has raised doubts about thousands of criminal cases. Annie Dookhan, 34, was picked up by state police at her home in Franklin, Massachusetts, and has been accused of obstruction of justice and pretending to hold master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts. She allegedly ""lied about the integrity of drug evidence that she analyzed,"" according to an attorney general statement Friday. Massachusetts authorities will review the sentences of 1,140 people who are in prison after being convicted with evidence at least partly provided by Dookhan, whose work with criminal evidence is under investigation. The former chemist has admitted to wrongdoing during her nine-year employment with the Department of Public Health. A preliminary investigation looked into every case Dookhan may have touched from 2003 until she left in March, and it is possible she touched 60,000 samples that were involved in 34,000 drug cases. ""There will be designated court sessions in each county to hear the cases,"" Chief Justice Robert Mulligan said in a statement. ""The Trial Court is fully cooperating with the prosecutors and defense counsel who are responding to these issues."" State police were tipped off in July by Dookhan's co-workers at the William A. Hinton State Laboratory in Jamaica Plain that her work might be unreliable. At the time, state police were taking over what had previously been a Department of Public Health drug laboratory, which certified random drug tests for the police departments in Norfolk, Suffolk, Middlesex and Bristol counties, as well as for Cape Cod and the nearby islands. ""When they were getting ready to take over the lab, they learned through conversations with other employees who were afraid to verify the work of their colleague,"" said Terrel Harris, communications director for the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security.

"London, England (CNN) -- Rowing across the North Pacific Ocean may hardly seem comparable to achieving success in the humdrum daily grind of an office desk job. For British adventure explorer Sarah Outen however, the gratification of completing a task of great importance to the self, is the same no matter the context or environment. ""It's so satisfying if you accomplish something that's a challenge to you,"" said the 26-year-old who last week set off on her quest to become the first woman to row the North Pacific solo. ""Whether you're in the water, or in an office, that's universal,"" she adds. Outen is undertaking the 4,500 nautical mile challenge from the east coast of Japan to the west coast of Canada, as part of a larger voyage that will see her circumnavigate the globe without the aid of any mechanical engines. She started in London in April 2011 and has so far made it 11,000 miles to Japan, biking and kayaking through Europe, Russia and China along the way. See also: Around the world on two boats and a bike . The epic journey will eventually see Outen return to London and after navigating the North Pacific, she plans to traverse North America by bike. A further solo ocean crossing -- this time the Atlantic Ocean -- will follow before she paddles back to her port of origin in the UK capital. ""I love the challenge,"" says Outen of the gargantuan adventure that will take her fully two and a half years to complete. ""I rowed across the Indian Ocean in 2009 and it was then that I thought up this journey (the London to London trip). I just wanted more time at sea and I wanted to experience that same human-powered pace across landscape,"" she adds. So far, Outen highlights some of the characters she has met along the way as inspiration in her darkest and most challenging moments. One man she met in a petrol station in eastern China was so inspired by her story that he bought a bike and joined her on the spot, accompanying her 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) across the country to Beijing and becoming a friend for life in the process. ""It was a special experience for both of us,"" Outen says of meeting her Chinese traveling companion, Gao, ""but really it was just wonderful to hear people's stories on the road and to learn a little bit about their lives and dreams."" See also: Naked rowers break Atlantic record . As she prepares for her latest adventure, Outen is well aware that this leg of the challenge is one that she will have no choice but to face on her own. A custom-made seven meter long row boat -- aptly named Gulliver -- will help her breach the vast ocean expanse between Choshi, Japan, and her next port of call Vancouver, Canada. Only a small solar cell on the vessel's exterior will provide power for a satellite radio and a camera that will keep Outen in touch with the outside world. ""There's no engines, no motors, no nothing on here. I'm the engine,"" she says excitedly of what will be her floating home for at least the next six months. Her friends and family have scrawled messages of support on the vessel's interior which will, no doubt, offer comfort during what is sure to be an emotionally and psychologically grueling journey. Outen has prepared methodically for these challenges, but she says the most difficult aspect has been getting ready for the physical demands of the trip. She has trained hard to build up her core strength and stamina as well as bracing herself for potential hazards along the way such as boat capsizes, shark attacks and extreme weather events like hurricanes. See also: Teenage round the world sailor takes on racing challenge . But the myriad dangers inherent in the task before her are not enough to dilute Outen's enduring sense of wanderlust and determination. ""I love that feeling of not quite knowing if you're going to make it through a certain scenario,"" she says. ""If the worst happens, at least I died trying. I think the worst thing in life is to end it with regrets or not having tried something,"" she adds. If all goes to plan, Outen aims to complete her Pacific crossing in a little over six months. She will then take a break for around six weeks before setting out across North America and onwards towards the finishing line on the banks of the River Thames in London. For now however, talk of returning to the UK and the completion of the full 20,000 mile odyssey seems a long way off. ""Its a year and a half more until I finish this journey at least so really there's still quite a way to go yet,"" she says.","Sarah Outen is aiming to become the first woman to row solo across the North Pacific Ocean .

Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Ralf Speth told CNN the F-Type -- footage of which was released exclusively on CNN's Quest Means Business -- carries the DNA of previous models. Speth said he expects the model, already creating extensive online chatter, to enjoy ""very special demand."" The previous E-Type, Speth added, ""was and still is a very, very iconic car and nobody can build such a car anymore."" Jaguar cars over the years . However the F-Type, is ""stuffed with DNA of all the Jaguar sports cars,"" Speth said. ""So the spirit, sportiness, design, quintessential Britishness is also in the F-Type."" Speth expects the car to sell well both in emerging markets and in Europe. China, in particular, is ""growing very strongly,"" he said. The company has seen sales increase, year-to-date, by more than 40%, he said. The car was engineered and designed in the UK by a team from the Royal College of Arts. Jaguar's director of design Ian Callum told CNN: ""We wanted the experience of sitting in the F-Type to be exciting. A sports car cockpit should be an intimate place and so we aimed to get a sense of the surfaces falling towards and then wrapping around the driver."" Jaguar pioneered the use of a touch screen for controlling the majority of its cars' functions but with the F-Type, the company focused on more physical interfaces for the driver. The F-Type also has a rigid aluminium structure intended to improve responses for the steering, throttle and brakes. The F-Type will go on sale in 2013.

"(CNN) -- Wildfires on Spain's Canary Islands have forced close to 5,000 people from their homes, the local government said Saturday. Weather conditions are complicating efforts to control the flames, which are burning on two of the islands -- La Gomera and Tenerife. ""The crews ... are having trouble stopping the spread of the fires,"" said Javier Gonzalez Ortiz, an area economy, security and housing minister. He cited winds, high temperatures and low humidity. Helicopters are helping to work both fires and shelters have been set up to assist those forced from their homes, the government said. The blazes have also forced some road closures. Approximately 2,500 people were evacuated on La Gomera, while the number on Tenerife was reported as slightly more than 2,220. The Spanish Canary Islands are located off the northwest coast of Africa.","Blazes are burning on the islands of La Gomera and Tenerife .

"(CNN) -- London's Wembley Stadium could host the climax of the 2020 European Championship Finals, CNN has learned. UEFA president Michel Platini is keen to revolutionize the tournament by holding matches across several European cities rather than just one or two countries. Platini is understood to have held talks with FA chairman David Bernstein last week about the semifinals and final being held in English capital. The Frenchman is keen for one city to host the final stages of the tournament with London a huge draw following its recent triumph in hosting the 2011 Champions League Final and more recently, the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The FA's chance of landing the showpiece event depends on whether Turkey, which is also keen to host the event, wins the right to host the Olympics in the same year. London successfully hosted the 2011 European Champions League final between Manchester United and Barcelona. That clash contributed to a record turnover of $532 million for UEFA and a profit after of tax of around $65 million, which was up from $14.5 million from the previous year. That game brought in $17.8 million for the FA and the governing body has already agreed a fixed rental price for next season's Champions League Final.","Wembley could host the final and semi-finals of Euro 2020 .

"(CNN) -- Lizzie Armitstead won the first medal of the London Games for the hosts but had to settle for silver behind Dutchwoman Marianne Vos in cycling's women's road race Sunday. Vos proved the stronger in the sprint for the line on The Mall to win her second Olympic gold medal after claiming the track points title in Beijing four years ago. Russia's Olga Zabelinskaya, the third member of a decisive breakaway, took the bronze. Defending Olympic champion Nicole Cook of Britain finished in the main bunch, just under 30 seconds behind the trio. With American Shelley Olds, the medalists took their chance after the second circuit of Box Hill and they quickly opened a good advantage. Olds dropped away after a puncture and with the peloton failing to eat into the lead of the breakaway, it all boiled down to a sprint finish after 140km racing in mostly wet conditions. The 25-year-old Vos, runner-up for the past five years in the world road race championships, finally went one better as she had too much strength for Armitstead. ""We gave everything in the breakaway. There were so many people. It was The Mall. It was like a wall of sound. I just sprinted to the line,"" Vos told gathered reports. ""After Beijing, that was the only thing that was on my mind for four years. Now that it's happened, it's incredible. Now the gold is mine."" Armitstead's performance was a welcome boost for home fans after the bitter disappointment of Mark Cavendish's failure to win the men's road race Saturday. The 23-year-old from northern England received superb support from teammate Emma Pooley on the testing two laps of Box Hill and took her chance when it emerged. ""I'm a bit shocked. I was so glad I committed to that break, but I should have jumped early, but never mind,"" she said. ""We discussed before what happened in the men's race that once a group is committed in front, it's hard to be in the back. ""It's the most special thing I've experienced in my life. It's crazy and so inspiring,"" she added. The cycling events continue Wednesday with time trial events for men and women.","Marianne Vos of the Netherlands wins women's road race .

"(CNN) -- Sitting in a meeting at NASA's Science Advisory Committee on Monday afternoon, I heard the news that Sally Ride had died. She was important to everyone in that room -- mostly space scientists and NASA officials. But for a handful of women like me, she was an irreplaceable leader. Sally Ride, first American woman in space, dies . Sally Ride wasn't the first woman to go into space, or to want to do so, much less the first woman qualified to do so. She would have been the first to tell you that. But as the first U.S. woman in space, on STS-7, the seventh flight of America's new space shuttle, she was the first woman astronaut most Americans knew about. And she used that fame for good. The first woman in space was Valentina Tereshkova, a Soviet cosmonaut whose pioneering flight took place only two years after her colleague Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space. At NASA, in contrast, there was a 20-year gap between human (male) space flight and Ride's historic flight. iReport: Sally's first launch confirmed 'women could achieve their dreams' Her giant step for womankind happened two decades later than it should have. That's why it was so important, especially for those of us women trying to succeed in male-dominated arenas. As STS-7 blasted off in 1983, I was finishing up my doctorate in physics -- astrophysics, to be more precise -- just as Ride had done a few years earlier. Most of my classmates were men, and I often felt out of place. Whether she shared that sense of being an outsider or not doesn't matter -- the important thing was that, thanks to her notoriety as a NASA astronaut, I found out about one more precious role model, someone in whose steps I could hope to follow. (OK, not the astronaut part -- I am far too chicken for that.) Ride made success seem attainable, even in the men-only world of physics. Born in 1951, Ride, like all women her age, grew up in a United States led by men, where it was major news if a woman became a pilot, ran for political office or headed a Fortune 500 company. She was part of a wave of accomplished women who broke through the barriers. Ride was one of the first six women accepted by NASA for astronaut training in a class of 35 selected in 1978. They were all pioneers, but after the STS-7 crew was announced, Ride's name became a household word. Share your tributes to Sally Ride . The press attention at the time was relentless, but she weathered it with evident calm. For a student like me, it was empowering to see such a talented, poised, accomplished woman take on this challenge -- one of the ""first woman this-or-that"" breakthroughs I had dreamed about as a child. One of Ride's astronaut classmates, Kathryn Sullivan, became the first American woman to walk in space. In 1984, Sullivan and Ride were crew mates on the STS-41-G flight, Ride's second time in space. Both flights were on the Challenger. Ride was training for her third shuttle flight when the Challenger exploded, on January 28, 1986. That led to a three-year moratorium on NASA human space flight. Ride served on the NASA board investigating the Challenger disaster, then left NASA in 1987. For her, the bloom must have been off the space shuttle rose. Sally Ride opens a new frontier for others . Ride could easily have rested on her laurels. Instead, she took on the great challenge of science literacy, especially for girls. She had gotten her doctorate in physics at a time when few women did so. She knew firsthand the joy of doing science and the satisfaction of helping advance knowledge. That must be one of the reasons she worked toward a world in which other women were encouraged to do science, not pushed away. iReport: Sally Ride inspired me to dream . In 2001 she started a company, Sally Ride Science, that runs science camps and daylong festivals for middle school girls as well as trains science teachers. Sally Ride Science is a partner in the GRAIL MoonKAM, a camera on NASA's Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory satellite now orbiting the moon, the first NASA flight project dedicated fully to education and public outreach. Her company is also involved with EarthKAM on the International Space Station. The ""KAM"" in both names stands for Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students -- that was Ride's grail. Light Years: Tributes pour in for Sally Ride . In the early 1960s, as NASA was selecting the Mercury 7 to be America's first astronauts, several dozen U.S. women underwent similar evaluation, in secret. A group of women later known as the Mercury 13, including some of the finest aviators of the day, passed the same grueling physical and psychological tests as the Mercury 7. According to Martha Ackmann, author of ""The Mercury 13: The Untold Story of 13 American Women and the Dream of Space Flight,"" some of the women scored better on the tests than their male counterparts of the Mercury 7. But none was ever accepted by NASA for training. Unlike Ride, the names of the women pilots and would-be astronauts are not widely known today: Jerrie Cobb, Bernice Steadman, Janey Hart, Jerri Truhill, Rhea Woltman, Sarah Ratley, Jan and Marion Dietrich, Myrtle Cagle, Irene Leverton, Gene Nora Jessen, Jean Hixson and Wally Funk. Some 40 years later, happily, they have been celebrated as pioneers and recognized with awards such as the Adler Planetarium's Women in Space Science award in 2005. I suspect these women appreciate the recognition but would rather have done what Ride did. They would rather have flown in space. News: Memories of my space flight with Sally Ride . Still, 343 hours in space wasn't all that Ride was about. Her true passion was opening doors for younger women, so they can follow their interests and talents without restrictions. Today, middle school students at Sally Ride Science learn the excitement and fun of science, the thrill and the challenge. Ride got to walk that walk in a big way. Her legacy is that other women do, too. Share your tributes to Sally Ride with us on CNN iReport.

"(CNN) -- Middle East tensions will remain high on the agenda at the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stepping up to the podium soon after Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. Here are five things to look out for during the third day of the session: . 1. The Palestinians are set to seek a new status at the United Nations, but Netanyahu is focused on Iran. A year after launching the Palestinian Authority's failed bid to win U.N. recognition as an independent state, Abbas is expected Thursday to formally announce a less ambitious initiative. This time, the Palestinian Authority will seek non-member observer status, one step up from its current position as a permanent observer. Last year's attempt to secure recognition of statehood stalled in the U.N. Security Council. The Palestinians say they are likely to submit the new resolution after the U.S. presidential election on November 6 in an effort to prevent the issue from becoming political fodder. They have already expressed concern about pessimistic comments by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney about the chances for peace in the region. Abbas is scheduled to make his speech toward the end of the morning session. Two slots after him comes Israel's Netanyahu, who is likely to focus more on the perceived threat from Iran than the lifeless peace process with the Palestinians. The issue of how to respond to Iran's controversial nuclear program has put a strain on relations between Netanyahu and President Barack Obama. Tehran insists its atomic program is for peaceful purposes, but Western leaders say they believe it is aimed at building a weapon. Netanyahu has been pushing the United States to establish a clear ""red line"" that Iran cannot cross if it wants to avoid war. Israel feels a sense of urgency, as negotiations aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions have failed to produce an agreement and the effectiveness of sanctions on Tehran remains unclear. 2. World powers will meet on the Iran issue a day after Ahmadinejad complains of double standards. The Iranian nuclear controversy is one of the recurring themes of this year's assembly. Netanyahu's speech and a ministerial meeting of global powers are likely to keep it in the spotlight Thursday. Obama said Tuesday that he remained committed to a diplomatic solution to the issue but that ""the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon."" Five things we learned on Day Two . Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has a history of controversial statements, gave onlookers little in the way of outrage in his eighth and final speech at the annual gathering on Wednesday. He said Iran was committed to peace, though he also accused world powers of double standards in pursuing an arms race. ""Continued threat by the uncivilized Zionists to resort to military action against our great nation is a clear example of this bitter reality,"" Ahmadinejad said. Ways to resolve the problem peacefully will be discussed by officials from France, Britain, Germany, China, Russia and the United States at a side meeting Thursday, and a minister-level meeting is expected to follow. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, overwhelmingly passed a resolution this month voicing concern about Iran's continued nuclear activity and urging Tehran to cooperate with international nuclear regulators. Ahmadinejad tells U.N. that Iran is threatened . 3. The president of Myanmar gets a chance to steal some of Suu Kyi's spotlight in the United States. A less gloomy storyline will be in evidence in the speech to the assembly Thursday by President Thein Sein of Myanmar, who has overseen a series of political reforms in the Southeast Asian nation that has spent decades under repressive military rule. While the United States and the Europe Union have been piling sanctions on Iran, they have also been steadily lifting them off Myanmar in response to the release of hundreds political prisoners, the pursuit of peace talks with ethnic rebels and the holding of freer elections. The latest softening of sanctions by Washington was announced Wednesday by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, following a meeting with Thein Sein. The United States will begin easing restrictions on the import of goods from Myanmar, Clinton said. Thein Sein, a former military official, will have a chance Thursday to grab some of the spotlight from Aung San Suu Kyi, the Myanmar opposition leader and Nobel laureate who received the Congressional Gold Medal last week during a 17-day visit to the United States. Diplomats and journalists are wondering if Suu Kyi, who spent the better part of two decades under house arrest in Myanmar for her pro-democracy campaigning, will be in the audience for Thein Sein's speech. She has expressed support for Thein Sein's efforts and even admitted to having a ""soft spot"" for some of the military leaders who kept her in detention. But she and others have also cautioned that Myanmar's reforms are still at a very early, fragile stage. 4. China isn't sending its A-Team, but it could still cause a stir. Most world leaders haven't passed up the opportunity to take their turn at the assembly's green marble podium this year, but China's top officials have other things on their minds running the the rising global power. President Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao appear to have skipped the trip to New York amid the political intrigue and jockeying in Beijing ahead of a once-in-a-decade leadership transition widely expected to kick off next month. This handover of power is especially sensitive in the wake of a dramatic political scandal involving murder and attempted defection that has played out in the international news media. As a result, Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi is leading the Chinese delegation at the assembly, and he will have plenty of subject matter at his disposal when he makes his speech during the afternoon session. Many observers will be waiting to see if he addresses China's myriad disputes with several of its neighbors over maritime territories. China's most heated dispute at the moment is with Japan over a set of islands in the East China Sea, a quarrel that has prompted violent anti-Japanese protests in China and soured economic ties between the two nations. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda of Japan referred indirectly to the situation in his speech to the assembly on Wednesday, underscoring Tokyo's commitment to using international law to resolve territorial disputes. The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing quickly dismissed Noda's comments as ""self-deceiving,"" the state-run news agency Xinhua reported Thursday. The question now is whether Yang will have more to say on the matter in the U.N.'s Great Hall. 5. Libyan leader speaks amid the fallout from the attack that killed U.S. ambassador and other Americans. The president of Libya's General National Congress, Mohamed al-Magariaf, is expected to address the assembly during the afternoon session. His nation's young government is dealing with the delicate aftermath of the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in the city of Benghazi this month that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. On Monday, Clinton praised the Libyan people for their efforts to rid the country of the rogue militias blamed for the killings. Al-Magariaf has said the militias would be disbanded. The episode has laid bare the challenges Libyan government officials face in imposing control on the country following the uprising that led to the fall of the dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was known for long, rambling orations at the United Nations. Obama said Tuesday that unrest was occurring in the throes of an unfinished regional revolution in the Middle East that brought an end to oppressive regimes in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia.

"(CNN) -- Sierra Leone's economy was tarnished by a decade-long civil war, but the resource-rich African nation is now ready to bounce back, according to the country's president. Ernest Bai Koroma said that a series of key financial reforms can help the west African country transform in the coming decades. ""I've challenged Sierra Leoneans -- and I'm sure they've accepted the challenge -- that in the next 50 years, we are not only going to transform ourselves from a low-income country, but we will get ourselves to the level of middle-income country,"" he says. ""By the next 50 years, Sierra Leone will be a donor nation rather than a recipient nation,"" Koroma adds. The ambitious declaration comes as Sierra Leone, whose tumultuous civil war ended in 2002, is stepping up efforts to improve its weak infrastructure -- the government is working with U.S. company Joule Africa to expand the Bumbuna Hydroelectric project in order to increase generation capacity in one of sub-Saharan Africa's least electrified countries. Koroma, who's been Sierra Leone's president since 2007, spoke to Marketplace Africa about the Bumbuna project and other development strategies aimed at bringing in more investors. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: As president, how do you rally a society past the trauma of war and help it keep the eye focused on the future? Ernest Bai Koroma: We have had our difficult past and we don't want to stick on the past. We want to focus on the future and that is why we are galvanizing the people to ensure that we learn from the mistakes of the past. We have opportunities, we have a great potential out there and Sierra Leone will transform itself. President: Sierra Leone's 'blood diamonds' in the past . I have made a pronouncement during our 50th anniversary celebrations that as a nation we have to look at our 50 years as a period of not only celebrating but reflecting on the issues of the past -- also using the mistakes of the past as lessons to ensure that our future and the next 50 years will be a future of a difference. And I've challenged Sierra Leoneans -- and I'm sure they've accepted the challenge -- that in the next 50 years, we are not only going to transform ourselves from a low-income country, but we will get ourselves to the level of middle-income country and by the next 50 years, Sierra Leone will be a donor nation rather than a recipient nation. CNN: It's been 10 years since the war, look ahead the next 10 years, where do you see Sierra Leone? EBK: Sierra Leone will have developed democratic values, to the point where it will no longer be considered as a fragile state. With all of the opportunities that avail themselves in the mineral sector, the agriculture sector, the tourism, we should be able to transform ourselves to a medium-level country. I believe with these gains we have made, we are not going to rest, we are going to continue to press on and Sierra Leone will be the place for investment opportunities. And with that, I'm sure within the next 10 years, Sierra Leone will be completely different. We will have basic infrastructures established, the road network will be up and about; communications, we'll be landing a fiber optic by next month and it will enhance our communication; educational sectors are now going through a reform process and we will continue to provide leadership and Sierra Leone will be completely different in the next 10 years. CNN: In many fragile post conflict states, the key challenge is infrastructure and making sure the infrastructure is able to manage the rebuilding of the whole country and the whole society. EBK: We quickly agreed on prioritizing our development agenda, and we call it in Sierra Leone, the Agenda for Change. And (in) that agenda we have energy, agriculture, infrastructure, health and education as the key sectors that should be given a priority and attention...We believe that because of our agriculture potential, if we enhance our agricultural productivity, we will not only be addressing the issues of food, self -sufficiency but we'll be addressing the issues of employment creation and also poverty reduction. CNN: Sierra Leone, right now, is one of the least electrified countries in sub-Sahara Africa but now you have this Bumbuna Hydroelectric project -- what are the immediate benefits for the economy and for the people of Sierra Leone? EBK: We inherited a very difficult situation in the energy sector. It was a sector that had less than 10 megawatts of energy provision for the whole country. That is why we, as a government, worked on the completion of the Bumbuna Hydroelectric Project, it is a project that has been well under construction for over 30 years...and people are realizing the benefits. Some of them have increased their domestic and economic activities because of a constant energy generation and they know that at the end of the day, ""if I pay my bills, I will continue to enjoy the supply and I enjoy the supply, I will be able to provide the services that will provide me an income,"" so I think it is a win-win situation.","Ernest Bai Koroma has been president of Sierra Leone since 2007 .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Thousands of people are expected to march Tuesday in South Africa to protest a portrait of President Jacob Zuma that shows his genitals. Zuma's supporters in the ruling African National Congress say the portrait is insulting and call it an attack on both the president and his party. About 15,000 people are expected to participate in the march to Johannesburg's Goodman Gallery, where the work was on display, according to the South African Broadcasting Corporation. The painting by artist Brett Murray, called ""The Spear,"" is reminiscent of Soviet-era propaganda posters. Red on one half and black on the other, the painting shows Zuma in a proud stance with his genitals prominently exposed. Attorney weeps as he argues for censoring painting . The painting was defaced last week after a storm of protests and condemnation, the SABC reported. ""We believe all these actions by the gallery are not only a violation of the right to dignity of ... President Jacob Zuma but are a clear and calculated attack on the ANC,"" the party said on its website. ""We therefore again call on all South Africans, members and (supporters) of the ANC and our alliance partners to come and register their outrage at this insult and attack on our president and the ANC,"" it said. The Sunday newspaper City Press removed the image of the portrait from its website after the ANC threatened a boycott, but it complained Monday the ANC still wants the paper to apologize for running it in the first place. Democratic Alliance, the ANC's official opposition, said The Spear ""was brilliant as a work of political satire, which is also why it became an instant icon."" Calls for the painting's censorship, the party said, indicate a dangerous move away from the right to free speech. If he felt insulted, Zuma should have sued the artist rather than calling for the painting's removal, the Democratic Alliance said.","The portrait shows President Jacob Zuma with his genitals exposed .

"(CNN) -- It's often proclaimed that ""behind a strong man there is a strong woman"" -- and in the case of Kenya's prime minister and his wife, the saying seems to be true. Ida Odinga, the wife of Kenyan leader Raila Odinga, has been a champion for female rights in Kenya for more than two decades now. A teacher by profession, Odinga established a women's voting league in 1991 and became known as the face of defiance during her country's one-party regime. She is also one of the first women to head a major corporation in the East African nation. ""It's good to be a wife, but it's good to be an educated wife. Being a wife, it's just not a position of subordination -- it's a position of strength,"" she says. ""And I make him [Raila Odinga] stronger by being strong."" Odinga opened up to CNN's Felicia Taylor about the role of women in Kenya and her life as the wife of the country's prime minister. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: What do you enjoy the most in your role as the wife of Kenya's prime minister? Ida Odinga: Meeting with the people, particularly meeting with the young women in schools and colleges, I enjoy being with them. The most rewarding thing that I find is that when I go out in schools and in colleges, and I mentor the girls and I see how they respond to mentorship. I don't only mentor the girls, I also mentor the girls, their parents and the community and I see the response. I find that really rewarding. CNN: What do you think is the changing role for women in Kenya now? IO: Women are taking up positions of responsibility, particularly in leadership -- political leadership, administrative leadership and all sorts of leadership. And that changing role is coming as a result of education. The other thing is that there is also a really large number of young bright women who are not able to pay school fees, who are not able to advance in education. And I look for means and ways to help them so that they can at least get the education. See also: Kenya PM: Sudan conflict threatens world oil prices . CNN: You were one of the first women to head a major corporation in East Africa, a liquefied gas cylinder manufacturing company. That doesn't sound like the easiest business. How did you do this? IO: The work is different because it is heavy duty work but I do enjoy it, like teaching. In teaching you start with young girls and you take them and in the end they become young women. And you see the development, in the end you see the work, the result of your work. Similarly, when you take raw materials and you cut it and you roll it and you weld it and you do this and in the end you see a beautiful cylinder standing on the other end, it is very rewarding. When you are satisfied with what you are doing and when you are in charge of what you are doing, you are powerful. And power is the nature of the game. The women must be powerful and they must remain strong. CNN: Your husband spent most of the 1980s jailed by president Moi's government. How hard was it on you? IO: It was very hard on me -- at that time I had three children, my eldest was nine years old then I had a five-year-old and a three-year-old. Now I was still a teacher in high school and I loved my job, I did it diligently and I enjoyed doing it. But then there were challenges because for all those years, I became like a political widow without a husband and my children had to go to school, they had to leave and so forth. I was not prepared to take care of the children alone and so this thing came to me as a surprise. But then I had to mature very quickly and know how to balance my life, how to be able to do my job and still bring up the children, single-handledly for those 10 years. See also: Queen of Kenyan radio: 'African women need a hand-up not a hand-out' But there's also something else that made it more difficult -- I was always being followed by the police, they were always following me and harassing me. It was never peaceful time. And in the process sometimes I would be arrested and thrown in the cell and remained there for a weekend. CNN: You've said, ""you must love yourself before someone else does."" What are you really trying to tell women? IO: When I say ""you must love yourself before someone else does,"" that's self esteem. Now if you love yourself, you want the best for yourself. You take care of your self and then others will see that and come and join you. Don't wait for someone to tell you how good you are, how strong, even how beautiful you are. You must know yourself that: ""I'm beautiful, I'm knowledgeable, I'm strong, I can do it! Join me to help me do it."" But don't wait for somebody to tell you because when you wait for people to tell you, then they'll take advantage of you because they'll think that they've made you. But make them understand that you make yourself. And after you've made yourself, then others can come to join you to make you stronger. CNN: That doesn't detract from being a fantastic wife, does it? You can be both. IO: It's good to be a wife, but it's good to be an educated wife. Being a wife, it's just not a position of subordination -- it's a position of strength. And I'd like to show them the best way to be a wife. You're a wife, I'm a wife of a prime minister and he loves me to death anyway. And I make him stronger by being strong.","CNN sits down with Ida Odinga wife of Kenya's prime minister, Raila Odinga .

"(CNN) -- In just over three weeks, Jason Dufner has won his first two PGA Tour titles and got married. As the new leader of the FedEx Cup series, the American has catapulted himself into the top-15 of the world rankings and is considered a real contender to win his first major at next month's U.S. Open. But what he really wants is a spot in Davis Love's Ryder Cup squad come September as the U.S. team seeks to avenge the 2010 defeat by Europe. ""I hope it gets Davis Love's attention. I think I will be No. 1 in the points, so I hope that gets his attention,"" Dufner told reporters after sinking a final-hole birdie to avoid a playoff at the Byron Nelson Championship on Sunday. ""Obviously being a Ryder Cup year, that would be special to have on your resume and play in, even if it's only for one time. That was one of my main goals. The FedEx Cup, being No. 1 is a great position to be in, but we're maybe a little more than halfway through, so we have a long haul on that."" Having been winless for 163 PGA Tour starts, Dufner finally broke his duck in New Orleans at the end of last month when he beat three-time major winner Ernie Els in a playoff to claim the $1.15 million first prize at the Zurich Classic. The 35-year-old then wed his partner Amanda, had his honeymoon at last week's Players Championship in Florida and took home another $1.17 million in Texas on Sunday as he denied fellow Alabama resident Dicky Pride the chance to claim his second title 18 years after his first -- which would have been a record gap. ""All these things that come with winning are great but I don't think much about 'em, other than the Ryder Cup and trying to win tournaments,"" Dufner said. ""You probably couldn't dream it any better than what's been going on here. The wedding has been in the works for close to a year so -- I guess I proposed in July -- but to win two events and get married in the span of 22 days, it's pretty remarkable. ""Amanda and I are lucky to be in the position we're in and to have each other and enjoy what's going on around us right now."" Last year Dufner was twice denied his maiden victory in playoffs, the latter coming in the PGA Championship as Keegan Bradley claimed his first major, but he insists he never lost faith that the breakthrough would come. ""People don't realize how fine the line is between winning. Sometimes that can be a hard pill to swallow, but when I've been on the other side of it, I always took encouragement from it, that I was playing great golf, and my time was going to come,"" he said.

"(EW.com) -- Disney's $250 million sci-fi epic ""John Carter"" earned an underwhelming $500,000 at midnight showings, the studio confirmed. According to Disney, that figure is in line with what 2010â€²s ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" earned. That movie, also a costly adventure flick, wound up debuting to $30.1 million -- and Disney would really like to see a ""3â€³ in front of John Carter's weekend gross. But it's still way too early to tell, as midnight figures cannot be entirely trusted. After all, just last Friday, ""Project X"" took in $1.2 million at midnight screenings en route to a $21.1 million weekend. Admittedly, ""Project X"" is a more midnight-friendly movie than ""John Carter,"" but then consider last year's action fantasy Immortals, which grossed $1.4 million at midnight showings and finished its first weekend with $32.2 million. However ""John Carter"" performs this weekend (we're predicting a $26 million debut), the movie will likely find a bit more love overseas.

"(CNN) -- The 2012 Olympic Games in London will see world-class competitors display their skills across 39 disciplines, with the British capital also taking the opportunity to showcase itself as a vibrant, modern, cultural center. A series of 12 Olympic and Paralympic posters were commissioned to promote the Games and show how art is firmly entrenched in London's plans for ""the greatest show on Earth."" Acclaimed British artist Tracey Emin was tasked with composing one of the posters; the 48-year-old is championing the involvement of art in the hosting of the Games. ""Culture runs alongside the Olympics,"" Emin told CNN. ""London, and Britain, has a lot more to offer than just sport."" Emin hoped her Paralympic poster, which bears the words ""You inspire me with your determination and I love you"" and pictures two birds, would be a complete contrast to the marketing material for previous Games. ""I want people to smile and feel kind of warm and feel that they're part of something and not excluded,"" she explained. ""The previous posters were a little bit on the macho fascist side. I wanted to do something which was the complete antithesis."" Art historian and exhibitions curator at London's Victoria and Albert Gallery, Ghislaine Wood concurs with Emin's views, explaining how Olympic posters provide an insight into the political mood of years gone by. ""Olympic posters provide a fantastic snapshot,"" said Wood. ""They really do provide a real insight into how posters communicate ideas at different points. Wood highlights the Munich Games of 1972 as an example of how Germany attempted to use the posters to change the way it was perceived globally following World War Two. ""There was a very conscious effort to change the look and feel of that Olympics. Fascist connotations of Berlin 1936 have been utterly changed to brand it as a modern, democratic event."" According to Wood, London's push to display itself as a forward-thinking city is not confined to its poster. The logo, the brainchild of designers Wolff Olins, and the spectacular Aquatics Centre also show how the city is attempting to stamp its identity on the Games. ""The Wolff Olins logo was a very powerful element in the whole branding of the London Olympics. If you look at (architect) Zaha Hadid's Aquatics Centre, a fantastic piece of modern, contemporary design, and the tower."" The tower Wood refers to is a 115-meter high steel sculpture designed by Britain's Anish Kapoor known as the Orbit, which has been erected at the Olympic Park. Kathryn Findlay works for Ushida Findlay Architects, a firm that was involved in the construction of the Orbit. She says the red twisting structure will provide a visual thrill for viewers both near and far. ""From afar, people in different parts of London will get glimpses of it,"" said Findlay. ""As you go there on the train you'll see this object appearing. As you go closer to it, the scale of the sculpture, and the color, are quite surprising. ""There are these mirrors on either side, which invert people and they'll see themselves reflected in the sculpture. ""It is eclectic, unexpected, it's inventive. Whether you like it or you hate it, you will always see it, like Big Ben or the London Eye, as one of these eccentric British creations.""","The 12 Olympic and Paralympic posters which will be used in 2012 have been unveiled .

"(CNN) -- South African ""blade runner"" Oscar Pistorius smashed a Paralympic record to win the men's 400m T44 in the final athletics event of the 2012 Games. Pistorius, who suffered a shock defeat in the 200m to Brazilian Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira, covered the 400m in the record time of 46.68 seconds. Oliveira missed out on a 400m medal after slipping from second place to fourth over the final 70 meters. American athletes Blake Leeper and David Prince took silver and bronze in 50.14 seconds and 50.61, respectively -- more than three seconds behind Pistorius, who bolted down the final stretch. The double-amputee later tweeted: ""What a special evening! The highlight of my Paralympic games was the crowd tonight! Gold in the final event of the London 2012 games!"" Opinion: Pistorius, an inspiration and a question . It was Pistorius' only individual gold medal win of the Paralympic Games. He took gold in the men's 4x100m relay, but failed to place in the individual 100m T44 and took silver in the 200m T44 individual event. Immediately after his 200m loss, the runner stirred up controversy by accusing the International Paralympic Committee of ignoring his concerns about the length of his rivals' prosthetics. From the side of the track, Pistorius described their blades as being ""unbelievably long."" ""You can't compete on stride length,"" he said. ""You saw how far (Alan) came back so, you know what, we're not racing a fair race here, but I gave my best on a great night."" Pistorius later apologized for the timing of his comments but said he believed ""there is an issue here."" The Paralympian made history in July by becoming the first double-amputee at able-bodied Summer Olympics when he competed at the 2012 Games in London. While the runner failed to win a medal, his presence on the track was lauded as an example of victory over adversity, and a lesson in dedication to a goal. After initially being refused permission to compete against able-bodied competitors, Pistorius hired a legal team to prove that his artificial limbs didn't give him an unfair advantage . Born with a congenital abnormality, Pistorius had both his legs amputated below the knee at 11 months of age and now runs on specially-adapted carbon-fiber limbs.","Oscar Pistorius beats U.S. rivals by more than three seconds .

"(CNN) -- From scavenging for food through garbage and sleeping in the streets, to becoming an international fashion model and a Hollywood A-lister, Djimon Hounsou's journey to stardom has been an astonishing one. The Benin-born actor, one of the most prominent film stars to come out of Africa, has appeared in blockbusters such as ""Gladiator,"" ""Amistad"" and ""Blood Diamond,"" and has worked with Hollywood royalty like Steven Spielberg and Leonardo DiCaprio. His role in the film ""In America"" made him the first black African man to be nominated for an Oscar, while his performance in ""Blood Diamond"" earned him a second nomination. See also: The best of African film . It's a long way from where the soft-spoken actor imagined he would be while growing up under difficult conditions in the West African country of Benin. ""I was just a very torn child, very wounded in so many areas, with no family support,"" recalls Hounsou, who grew up without his parents, who had moved to Ivory Coast. ""I happened to the be the fifth child of my family,"" he explains, ""so everybody was already grown and had left home already."" For Hounsou, who finally met his father for the first time around the age of 10, this was a ""very lonely"" period of his life. ""The dream was to escape that surrounding,"" he says. At the age of 13 he left Benin to move to Paris with his older brother -- but the hardship continued. ""The rocky time came right after I left school,"" remembers the acclaimed actor. ""I spent a lot of time at night navigating the streets of Paris trying to find something to eat,"" he says. ""I was not anymore legal because I'm no more a student and I could not work. So I was left out on the street, I couldn't walk around too much because obviously if you get caught, noticed or get stopped by the police you're deported immediately."" Hounsou's good looks, however, did get noticed by a Paris photographer, who invited him to audition as a fashion model. There, Hounsou met famous French designer Thierry Mugler and soon established himself as a successful high-fashion model. The collaboration with Mugler also took Hounsou to the United States for the first time, where he quickly started working toward realizing his dream of becoming an actor. See also: The evolution of African cinema . He made his foray into the industry by appearing in music videos and went on to feature in Roland Emmerich's 1994 film ""Stargate."" But the break-out moment in Hounsou's acting career came three years later with Steven Spielberg's ""Amistad,"" where he appeared alongside Hollywood legends Anthony Hopkins and Morgan Freeman. ""It was one of the most powerful stories about Africans that define African Americans' legacy and that a lot of people were shy about wanting to hear, wanting to see,"" says Hounsou of the film. Another defining moment for Hounsou was his performance in 2006's ""Blood Diamond,"" where he won rave reviews for portraying a fisherman forced to work in a diamond mine after being captured by rebels. The film was set in Sierra Leone in the 1990s -- a time of civil war and a period when more than 4% of all African diamonds were sold on the black market. ""My passion is more about bringing the stories out from the African continent mixed with the West,"" says Hounsou. Hounsou, who is married to former fashion model Kimora Lee Simmons, is also an outspoken activist and a prominent campaigner in the fight against climate change. His desire to make a difference has seen him working with charities such as Oxfam and SOS, while in 2009 he spoke at the United Nations' Summit on Climate Change in New York -- a far cry from his early days as a lonely child in Benin. But despite all he's achieved so far, Hounsou says his remarkable life journey is just starting. He says: ""It was a great journey, but I strongly feel like I'm still at the beginning of that journey"".","Djimon Hounsou is a critically acclaimed film star from Benin, West Africa .

"London (CNN) -- Yesterday brought the sad and perplexing news that Tony Scott, hugely successful British director of sleek, big-budget action films such as ""Crimson Tide"" and ""Enemy of the State"" had apparently taken his own life by jumping off Los Angeles' Vincent Thomas bridge. It was a tragic end to a trailblazing career that took Scott on an amazing journey from modest, working-class beginnings in the northeast of England to the Hollywood A-list. He may never have received the recognition the Academy has bestowed upon his elder brother Ridley, but Tony wasn't out to please the critics and he didn't have aspirations to make high-art. Instead he was a thrill-seeking adventurer who loved fast cars (he got into filmmaking upon his brother's assurance that he would be able to buy a Ferrari within a year) and embraced the American way of life and filmmaking. Scott unapologetically specialized in action movies and, within his chosen genre, he was an undeniably accomplished figure. Official: Director Scott left notes in car, office . Perhaps surprisingly for a director so associated with Hollywood blockbusters, it was the British Film Institute that launched both Tony and Ridley Scott's filmmaking careers in the 1960s, via its production fund supporting experimental filmmaking. The BFI provided a grant for Ridley Scott's debut short film ""Boy and Bicycle,"" which starred a beaming 16-year-old Tony in the titular role, and subsequently helped fund the younger Scott's first directorial forays: the short films ""One of the Missing"" and ""Loving Memory."" From these early successes, Tony went on to direct hundreds of TV commercials for his brother's production company, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA). Here he became a master craftsman, developing the heightened visual style and preoccupation with surface aesthetics that would later become the hallmark of his feature films. Despite the film business' historic disdain for the TV advertising industry, Tony and Ridley Scott were among the first to enter the world of filmmaking after directing commercials, forging a path that would later be followed by the likes of David Fincher and Duncan Jones. Since the mid-1980s, Tony Scott's name has been synonymous with action films; populist, high-octane adventures that found little favor with the critics but thrilled audiences and almost always delivered generous box-office returns. Working with producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson on films such as ""Top Gun,"" ""Beverley Hills Cop II,"" and ""Days of Thunder,"" Scott pioneered a new approach to the action film grounded in the glossy, heightened aesthetics and technical virtuosity of his TV commercials (a Saab advert had helped him secure the ""Top Gun"" job). Director Tony Scott: An appreciation . Bursting at the seams with the muscular ideology of the Reagan era, these films eschewed emotional and dramatic realism in favour of bravura style, bombastic characters and escapist narratives. The approach proved box-office gold with ""Top Gun,"" which became the highest grossing film of 1986, taking $176 million, and helping Jerry Bruckheimer become one of the most successful producers of all time. The 1990s saw Scott embrace darker territory with the Mexico-set tale of adultery and murder, ""Revenge,"" starring Kevin Costner, and the uncharacteristic road movie ""True Romance,"" written by Quentin Tarantino and starring Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette and Dennis Hopper. Scott returned to big, loud, action movies with the apocalyptic submarine thriller ""Crimson Tide,"" the first of five collaborations with actor Denzel Washington; the pair would team up again for ""Man on Fire,"" ""Deja Vu,"" ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" and ""Unstoppable."" The latter, a commercial and critical success, would prove to be Tony Scott's last film, although at the time of his death the endlessly busy director reportedly had numerous projects (including a rumored sequel to ""Top Gun"") in development. At 68, one felt he still had several blockbusters left in him. His profound influence is felt in the glossy action movies of contemporary directors such as Michael Bay (""Transformers"") and Joe Carnahan (""The A-Team""), whose success has followed in the wake of Scott's creation of a new era-defining style of mainstream cinema. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Blackford.","Blackford: Tony Scott was a thrill-seeking adventurer and master craftsman .

"Charlotte (CNN) -- Four years later, consider the role reversal: As he closes his convention, Barack Obama's greatest challenge is to make the case against change. Yet he can't ask the American people to simply stay the course. The challenge, both daunting and delicate, is to make the case that his first-term policies were correct but that the second-term results will be dramatically different. Veteran Democratic pollster Peter Hart says the president's challenge is to provide a clear and credible answer to this: ""Why will you be better off in the second term?"" And Hart argues that the stakes, already high, are higher still now because of the strong prime-time performances of first lady Michelle Obama and former President Bill Clinton. ""This convention is now a home run derby,"" Hart said. Four years ago in Denver, Sen. Barack Obama sold himself as the candidate of hope and change, presenting himself as a different brand of politician, someone who would change Washington -- and the economy -- for the better. Obama to speak after forceful Clinton endorsement . But if Washington has changed at all, it is for the worse. And while both sides can find statistics that support their arguments on the state of the economy, it is clear that many Americans at best feel they are treading water. So the tone is very different in Charlotte than in Denver. So is the targeting. Four years ago, the goal was to expand the map, and the Obama campaign ultimately succeeded. This year, the path to 270 Electoral College votes and victory is less certain, though the president does have more viable options than does GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Still, because of the changed climate, the Obama acceptance speech will close a Democratic convention that for the most part has been a giant get-out-the-vote rally, speakers chosen because of their appeal to specific constituencies (African-Americans, Latinos, suburban women, gays and lesbians) or major battleground states. The most sustained appeal to undecided or independent voters was Wednesday's prime-time dissertation by Clinton. Speaking to supporters Thursday morning, the president talked broadly about his test of convention success. ""Hopefully, at the end of this convention, people will say we accomplished what we needed to and delivered our vision for the country and offered a clear contrast to what people saw in Tampa,"" the president said. Obama readies two-term pitch . While Charlotte has had plenty of contrast with the GOP convention in Tampa, there has been virtually no specific talk of the president's policy goals for the next four years. Will he, like Romney, offer a specific jobs target? Will he offer a new deficit reduction goal? Venture into goals or timetables for immigration reform? How the president packages his pitch also could be defining. For Ronald Reagan, the second term was wrapped as ""Morning in America."" Clinton's 1996 bid for a second term was sold as his ""Bridge to the 21st Century."" Thursday night, Obama's challenge is to sell his road map. And beyond the need to lay out a second-term policy agenda, some other Obama challenges are obvious. Voters, albeit by a narrow margin, view Romney as better able to manage the economy. And while Obama leads when voters are asked which candidate best understands the middle class, the latest CNN/ORC International polling showed that Romney significantly narrowed that gap as a result of the Republican convention. The president's top political advisers see discouragement as their greatest potential enemy. Proof of this is in a look at recent national polling: The president's numbers among registered voters are stronger than his numbers among likely voters, meaning a fair share of potential Obama voters aren't as engaged or interested this time around. First lady seeks to reignite flame for president . Again, that is the strategy behind the convention agenda: careful targeting of the different pieces of the Obama 2008 coalition. But for all the help he is getting from his friends, it is up to Obama himself to close the deal. Now, the role of one speech should not be overstated. Just hours after the convention closes, the government will release August jobs data -- and that data could significantly shape morning-after reflections on the president's big moment. Plus, there are two months of campaigning and three presidential debates ahead, so this isn't his last chance. But it's a giant opportunity, his unfiltered chance to make the case against change.","Stakes for Obama's speech are higher after two prime-time performances .

"(CNN) -- The touchdown catch that wasn't. The first touchdown interception. The inaccurate reception. Whatever you call it, don't call the controversial call by replacement refs in the Green Bay Packers-Seattle Seahwaks game a catalyst for the tentative labor deal with National Football League referees, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Thursday. ""It may have pushed the parties farther along, but we were really in intensive negotiations for the last two weeks,"" Goodell told reporters in a conference call Thursday to discuss the agreement, reached late Wednesday. Goodell also said he was sorry the league felt it had to resort to the replacements, few of whom had any previous NFL officiating experience. Many were high school or low-level college officials who hold down myriad other jobs, from schoolteachers to attorneys. ""We worked as hard as we could and we did the best we could,"" said Henry Zaborniak, a fill-in line judge who lives in Ohio. ""None of us felt like we could replace the regular guys. You can't replace that sort of ability en masse."" Zaborniak, who spent 15 years as a Big Ten official, said he and his colleagues never imagined working this long. He thought they'd work one game and go home. While the officials were excoriated in the media, Zaborniak said the players were very professional. ""I can't think of one unkind thing I could say about them,"" he said. ""They were tremendous."" Goodell declined to criticize the replacements despite weeks of botched calls that raised the ire of fans nationwide. ""Everything they did, every call, was magnified,"" Goodell said. ""They kept the game going. They worked hard. They trained hard. They were incredibly focused and dedicated."" The eight-year deal -- the longest ever for officials, according to the NFL -- gives the union referees a pay raise and keeps their pension program in place for five years. It suspends a lockout that began before the league's preseason, leading to a series of gaffes that climaxed in a furor over a botched call that allowed the Seahawks to walk away with a victory in Monday night's nationally televised game. The league acknowledged Tuesday that the Packers should have won, but allowed the result of the game to stand. Fans and players rejoiced in the news that regular referees would return, beginning with Thursday night's game between the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Ravens. ""Never thought I would be excited for the refs to come back to work but it's about time,"" Cleveland Browns receiver Josh Cribbs tweeted Thursday. ""It was definitely necessary!"" Photos: Blown calls . In place of the replacement referees, most of whom had officiated no more than a handful of pro games, the league put together a veteran crew with a combined 70 seasons of NFL experience to handle Thursday night's game at Baltimore. Before the game, fans stood and clapped for the officials as the seven men tipped their caps. Goodell said it was challenging to figure out how to get regular referees back on the field less than 24 hours after striking the tentative deal, but not for lack of enthusiasm among the officials to get back to work. ""They wanted to do what they love doing and make a contribution to the game, and that's a tribute to them,"" Goodell said. While they have not called a game since last season, the league's veteran crews will be ready to go, said retired official Mason ""Red"" Cashion. ""These guys have been working every week, really since May, to get ready for the season, through conference calls, through video, through meetings of their own,"" Cashion said. ""And that's something that the officials have done simply because they have enough pride in what they do that they wanted to be ready. And they are ready."" SI: NFL's most embarrassing moments . The eight-year deal, which must be ratified by union members, includes details about officials' pensions and retirement benefits, and adds a pay bump from $149,000 a year in 2011 to $173,000 in 2013. The pay will rise to $205,000 by 2019. The agreement will also allow the NFL to hire some officials on a year-round basis and hire additional referees so they can be trained. ""This agreement supports long-term reforms that will make officiating better. The teams, players and fans want and deserve both consistency and quality in officiating,"" Goodell said. What the refs were negotiating . The return of the league's regular referees won't put an end to controversial calls, said retired NFL player Tiki Barber. But it will raise the respect level between coaches and players and officials, Barber said. ""There's still going to be arguing with referees,"" he said. ""They're still going to make bad calls. But now we're going to know that it's coming from a base of knowledge. These guys know what they're talking about and they're going to have an argument for why they do what they do on the field."" Fired up over NFL referees? Share your thoughts. The deal came almost exactly 48 hours after the controversial ending of the Monday night game, which the Seahawks won 14-12 after replacement officials gave possession of a disputed ball, and a touchdown, to Seattle receiver Golden Tate. In what became a widely mocked symbol of the quality of officiating by the replacements, a photo from that game shows two officials in the end zone displaying competing signals: one indicating a touchdown, the other an interception. The result generated intense and immediate criticism of the league -- even President Barack Obama weighed in Tuesday urging a quick resolution. On Thursday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama was ""very pleased"" with the resolution. Goodell said he was not surprised by the outcry. ""I've come to learn in the NFL, particularly with the popularity of the game and the influence it has in today's society, not much surprises me about what happens in the NFL,"" he said. Despite prodding by reporters, he declined to closely dissect the play that ended Monday night's game beyond the statement the NFL issued Tuesday. In that statement, the NFL said the replacement refs should have called an offensive pass interference penalty on Seattle that would have ended the game, but supported the referees' decision not to overturn the ruling on the catch. Goodell also declined to grade the replacements, saying that wasn't part of his duties. But he warned fans that mistakes will still happen, even with the return of the veterans. ""It's not realistic to think that officiating will be perfect,"" he said. Much as it was after the Monday game, Twitter was buzzing with discussion of the deal. For a while, in the early morning, the name of one of the NFL's more iconic officials, the heavily muscled Ed Hochuli, was one of the most-discussed topics among Twitter users in the United States. ""I've never been more excited to see another man's biceps than this Sunday to see Ed Hochuli back officiating,"" a Twitter user named Robby Donoho wrote. ""It's. About. Time.""

Bryan Cranston was favored to win this category for a fourth time, with many hoping ""Mad Men's"" Jon Hamm would dethrone the king. Lewis was a dark-horse favorite for his shifty performance as a turncoat Marine in the Showtime drama. ""I still get jokes going through the airport, do you have a vest on?""

"(CNN) -- France has been accused of passing the problems of its long-neglected suburbs off to others, after the country's Socialist president Francois Hollande agreed to a deal in which Qatar will invest millions of euros to help regenerate the disadvantaged ""banlieues"" of Paris. The plan, which has been met with widespread criticism from across the political spectrum, was first put forward in November last year under the tenure of former president Nicolas Sarkozy. Aneld, a group representing local elected officials who advocate for diversity in deprived areas met with Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar last November, to secure an investment of 50 million euros. The vice-president of Aneld, Leila Leghmara, told CNN she had regularly been approached by young people brimming with ambitious projects, but had no financial backing to see them through. The idea behind the fund is to inspire hope in the poor, troubled French suburbs with high immigrant populations. But the plans were put on hold by Sarkozy, for fear of jeopardizing his chances of re-election -- his infamous suggestion to ""clean the suburbs with a high pressure hose"" when acting as minister of the interior in 2005 had not been forgotten. The fund was given new life last week when members of Aneld met with the French industrial recovery minister, Arnaud Montebourg, who approved the plan and agreed to match Qatar's investment, bringing the fund's total to 100 million euros. With Qatar already having made large investments in French utility companies such as Veolia and Suez environment, as well as media group Lagardere, and more recently the purchase of French football club Paris Saint-Germain, this latest announcement of French-Qatari cooperation was met with heavy criticism by both the French left and right. Lionel Luca, the Member of Parliament for the center-right Union of Popular Movement (UMP), called for a parliamentary investigation into Qatar's ""interest"" in France in an open letter to the president of the National Assembly. ""It would not be troubling if Qatar were a secular democracy or even a non-proselytising religious state. However, this country practices fundamentalist Islam,"" Luca wrote. Nicolas Demorand, editor-in-chef of France's left wing newspaper Liberation, questioned the motives behind the investment in an editorial. ""To see Qatar land in the French suburbs as a stand-in for a cash-strapped French Republic deserves to be looked at twice,"" Demorand mused. Marine Le Pen, head of France's far right National Front party, whose presidential campaign played heavily on the fear of immigrants -- particularly those of Muslim origins, also weighed in with a communique titled ""French Islamic Trojan Horse,"" in which she accused Qatar of investing in the ""banlieues"" because of the high number of Muslims present there. ""These investments are in no way for humanitarian reasons, they are political and religious. It is a major political mistake to accept this and it will come at the price of our independence not only in our country but also in the context of our international policy,"" she wrote. CNN has sought comment from the Qatari government and from French government officials on the plan, but has not yet received a response. Leghmara is concerned that the fund is proving divisive as the details of how the money will be spent are yet to be decided. She argues the investment will be a huge help to all those who are out of work. With the number of unemployed in France reaching three million in August -- the highest figure since 1999 -- she believes job creation would be welcomed.","Qatar to invest millions of euros to help regenerate disadvantaged suburbs of Paris .

"Olympic Park, London (CNN) -- The Olympic ethos may be centered on the pursuit of athletic excellence, but performance-enhancing drugs offer a way for competitors to gain Games glory via unfair advantage. To the frustration of many, the use of illegal substances has marred all recent Olympic Games, and London 2012 has been no different. Two athletes, Albanian weightlifter Hysen Pulaku and Luiza Galiulina of Uzbekistan, have already been sent home from the British capital after testing positive for the steroid stanozolol and the diuretic furosemide respectively. So what is the process of screening for banned substances and why, despite all the risks involved, do athletes try so hard to get away with using them? The history of doping and the Olympic Games . According to UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) the practice of using ""substances and artificial ways of enhancing performance"" is as old as organized sport itself. In Ancient Greece, athletes used special diets and stimulants to improve their chances of winning the athletics competitions, while Roman Emperor Nero allegedly drank a potion of wild boar's manure to aid his performance in the Games. When Danish cyclist Knud Enemark Jensen died at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, his autopsy revealed traces of amphetamine, and the following outcry led to drug testing being adopted by the world cycling and football federations -- as well as the International Olympic Committee in time for Mexico '68. Screening for drug cheats has been a crucial process in each Olympic Games since this time, and led to the IOC creating a prohibited list of substances . The system has uncovered state-sponsored doping programs, such as those employed by East Germany in the 1970s and '80s and China in the 1990s, as well as individual cases, such as the infamous Canadian 100-meter runner Ben Johnson and American sprinter Marion Jones. Over the last five Olympics an average of 12 athletes per event have been found guilty of taking banned substances. Technology has played a crucial role too -- with each advance in the screening process used by organizers, there is an advance by dope cheats in the complexity of drugs used to avoid detection. World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) director general David Howman told CNN the list of banned substances runs to 10-15 pages, with hundreds of drugs currently prohibited. ""The fight continues and the sophistication continues on both sides,"" he said. ""You find that athletes and those that advise athletes are more sophisticated in what they do than they were 10 years ago."" What do the drugs do? ""Anabolic steroids provide muscle fiber and bulk, whereas a hormone like erythropoietin (EPO) brings more red blood cells to the system,"" says Dick Pound, former IOC vice president and former president of WADA. ""More red blood cells brings more oxygen to the muscles, so the athlete has more energy. That's why some athletes take blood transfusions before their races, to boost this count. ""Stimulants can increase heart rate, human growth hormone promotes muscle and bone growth and reduces body fat. It can help strength, power, stamina, improves recovery time so you can train harder and for longer. But archers may take drugs that have the opposite affects, to reduce the tremor in their hands,"" Pound told CNN. ""They say drugs can make 1% of a difference, but 1% over the distance of 100m is a tenth of a second, that's huge! You can imagine what it would do over a marathon.""Because all these drugs are under the radar and their use is covert we don't have test groups to know what damage this does to the human body. But you could expect liver damage, high blood pressure, androgynization of females. If you take EPO your blood becomes like sludge, your heart can't pump this stuff through the system."" What is new for London 2012? The London Games is the first to use a private company, in this case GlaxoSmithKline, to help provide logistics for drug screening. Professor David Cowan, director of King's College London's Drug Control Center and chief scientist for the Games, is in charge of the GSK lab. ""These laboratories are the most high-tech labs in the history of the Olympics, analyzing more samples than ever before,"" Cowan told CNN. ""Across the range of instruments in the lab, we reckon we can pick up things you haven't even thought of and we can test retrospectively if new drugs are developed."" ""I think we'll soon be away from the days where designer drugs beat the analyst. I'm hoping this will be the Games that actually prove that."" At London 2012, the athletes themselves seal the bottles and fill in the paperwork, in order to minimize the contamination risk, and only then are the samples opened by a specialist in the testing lab. Which athletes are screened? Screening operates in the following way: . -- Athletes are screened in the run-up to the Games and can face repeat tests after the competition period of July 27-August 12. -- The first five finishers in every event are chaperoned immediately to give mandatory tests, with samples of both blood and urine taken, and then from another two athletes at random. -- Samples are collected straight after the event at the relevant venue and split into two lots: ""A"" and ""B."" -- There are also unannounced spot tests conducted at random, both inside the Olympic Village and at other athlete accommodation. -- Test results are processed with the ""A ""sample (as depicted above) usually within 24 to 72 hours -- some substances, like the hormone EPO, can take longer to screen. -- The ""B"" sample is retained for any further backup testing that might be needed. -- IOC officials comment only when drug tests fail. -- Any refusal to provide a sample will lead to expulsion, as was the case with Hungarian discus thrower Zoltan Kovago ahead of the opening ceremony. What happens if an athlete tests positive? If the ""A"" sample shows positive, the IOC will start its investigation procedure. The athlete in question has the opportunity to ask for the ""B"" sample to also be tested, and can be present when the sample is opened to verify there has been no contamination. If this also returns a positive reading, the IOC and the involved sport's national association will hear the athlete's reasoning before deciding on whether a violation has been committed. For those found guilty, the IOC will recommend sanctions to the national body. Is enough being done? ""The equipment and technology is better in London, and the knowledge is more extensive,"" Pounds says. ""But if you're a sophisticated doper and you test positive, you fail two tests: a drugs test and an IQ test. You need programs that are randomly tested over long periods.""We know we're not catching all the drug users. We're catching maybe 20% of the sophisticated users, it's a big problem. What's going on now is that athletes are taking advantage of the fact you are allowed four times the amount of normal levels of testosterone if you're competing. ""So now they can inject a pellet into their butt which will slow-release small doses of testosterone but won't go over the threshold. We have tests to find artificial testosterone, but the games (of catching them) go on. We're getting better, but we need to keep getting better -- and the labs need to test for everything on the list. ""You'd be pretty ambitious to say London 2012 was a clean Games. There are drugs we don't know about yet so we need to keep finding them and hunting down the distribution networks.""","Artificial ways of enhancing performance is as old as organized sport itself .

"Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian police have arrested six gang members in connection with the May assassination attempt on a former minister, police said Tuesday. Fernando Londono, a former minister of the interior and justice, survived the May 15 bombing, which killed two of his security team and injured nearly 40 others. Ex-minister target of Colombian bomb . Security cameras in Bogota captured someone throwing a package at the vehicle Londono was riding in and then speeding away on a waiting motorcycle. The leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla group, commonly known as the FARC, was suspected immediately in the attack, but police did not make a connection to the group. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos called the suspects ""common criminals"" on his Twitter page. And while police said six arrests were made, Santos and the attorney general's office put the number at five. Four of the arrests were made in the city of Cali, and one, of a minor, was made in Bogota, the attorney general's office said in a statement. The minor is suspected of being the one who threw the bomb, the office said. Londono was minister of the interior and justice from 2002 to 2004 during the administration of President Alvaro Uribe. He was known for being outspoken against leftist rebel groups, including the FARC. Londono travels with a sizable security detail because of numerous threats against him.

"(CNN) -- The downfall of senior Communist Party ""princeling"" Bo Xilai has become one of the most closely watched political scandals in China. Culminating in a suspended death sentence for a murder charge against his wife, Gu Kailai, the veritable soap opera offers a glimpse into the workings of the highest echelons of the Chinese government, which is preparing for a once-in-a-decade leadership transition this fall. November 14, 2011 . Briton Neil Heywood is found dead in a hotel room in Chongqing, a municipality in southwestern China. Authorities later rule the cause of death was alcohol poisoning, and his body is cremated. Heywood had been working as a business consultant in China for more than a decade. His death did not receive widespread attention until rumors of Bo Xilai's alleged involvement arose in February. February 6, 2012 . Bo's right-hand man, Chongqing police chief and deputy mayor, Wang Lijun flees to the U.S. consulate in Chengdu. He stays one night before leaving ""of his own volition"" with Chinese security forces, according to the U.S. State Department. Wang has not been seen in public since. The Chongqing government releases a statement saying Wang has gone on medical leave for stress. March 9, 2012 . At the annual National People's Congress meeting, Bo speaks out at a press conference, dismissing the allegations against him and his family as ""sheer rubbish."" ""A few people have been pouring filth on Chongqing and me and my family,"" he said, rejecting Western media reports that his son drove a Ferrari. March 15, 2012 . The state-run Xinhua news service announces that Bo Xilai has been stripped of his post as party secretary of Chongqing. March 26, 2012 . The British Foreign Office confirms that in February it formally requested China to open a new inquiry in Heywood's death. In response to speculation that Heywood was working as a spy in China, British Foreign Secretary William Hague later announces that Heywood ""was not an employee of the British Government in any capacity."" April 10, 2012 . Xinhua announces that Gu Kailai and family employee Zhang Xiaojun have been ""transferred to judicial authorities on [the] suspected crime of intentional homicide."" The same day, Xinhua reports that Bo has been suspended of his membership in the party's Politburo and the Central Committee-- the nation's ruling bodies-- because of suspected ""serious breach of regulations."" April 24, 2012 . A graduate student at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, Bo Xilai's son, Bo Guagua, makes his first public statement in the university's newspaper. The 24-year-old denies rumors that he was living a playboy lifestyle while studying abroad but declines to comment on the ongoing investigation into his parents. June 13, 2012 . A French architect believed to be a close associate of Gu Kailai, Patrick Devillers, is arrested at his home by local police in Phnom Penh at China's request. Cambodian police later say that Devillers, 52, flew from Cambodia to China on July 17 of his own accord to assist Chinese authorities with their investigation into Gu. Devillers has denied any wrongdoing. July 26, 2012 . Gu Kailai and family employee Zhang Xiaojun are charged with ""intentional homicide"" and will be prosecuted in the Hefei municipal court in Anhui province, according to Xinhua. It's not clear whether Gu and Zhang have yet entered a plea because the legal proceedings have so far been behind closed doors. Meanwhile, Bo and the two suspects in the case have been kept out of the public eye since March and are unreachable for comment. August 20, 2012 . Following a one-day trial on August 9, the court delivered a guilty verdict for Gu Kailai in the murder in the death of Neil Heywood. It gave her a suspended death sentence, which is expected to be commuted to life in prison if Gu does not commit crimes during a two-year reprieve. Family aide Zhang Xiaojun was also found guilty in Heywood's death and sentenced to nine years in prison.","Court finds Gu Kailai guilty of murdering Neil Heywood and gives her suspended death sentence .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich maintained their perfect start to the Bundesliga season with a 2-0 win away to Werder Bremen on Saturday. Two late goals from Luiz Gustavo and Mario Mandzukic sealed a sixth straight win for Jupp Heynckes' side and stretch their lead over Frankfurt -- who play Freiburg on Sunday -- to five points. Gustavo's 81st minute effort gave Bayern the lead as the match looked to be heading for a draw with Mandzukic scoring three minutes later to seal all three points. ""We were too slow in the first half and my players tested my patience a bit. I had to find hard words for my halftime talk and in the end it was enough for a win against a tough Bremen side,"" Heynckes said. Reigning champions Borussia Dortmund routed Moenchengladbach 5-0 to rise to third in the table. Marco Reus scored a brace against his old club with defender Neven Subotic, Ilkay Guendogan and Jakub Blaszczykowski also getting on the score sheet. Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen are up to seventh in the table after beating Greuther Fuerth 2-0, while Stuttgart enjoyed their first win of the season, beating Nuremberg by the same scoreline. Hamburg also claimed a valuable three points with a 1-0 win over Hannover. Bottom-of-the-table Augsburg played out a goalless draw at Hoffenheim in a game overshadowed by concern for Boris Vukcevic. The 22-year-old Hoffenheim midfielder is in a critical condition after his car collided with a truck on Friday.

"(CNN) -- Are you clamoring for the real NFL officials yet? If not, just wait and then prepare to issue an apology to one of the most unjustly crucified groups in society this side of baseball umpires. For starters, the NFL's exhibition season was filled with gaffes, bloopers and worse than that involving its collection of replacement officials. Blown pass interference calls. Issues with spotting the football. Confusion over the clock. Plus, in a game between the home-team Atlanta Falcons and the Baltimore Ravens, the referee kept saying ""Arizona"" instead of ""Atlanta"" when addressing the crowd. So it was somewhat of a relief that during the NFL's season opener Wednesday night between the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants, the replacement officials were -- well, OK. There were no glaring blunders, and none of the new guys tripped over the 50-yard line. Still, as former NFL director of officials Mike Pereira told FoxSports.com, ""One game doesn't make a week, but it was definitely a good start. We'll all know more come Tuesday morning."" By then, the NFL's other 30 teams will have spent their opening game with these replacement officials who primarily work for Division II and Division III colleges. They were hired by the NFL courtesy of the league's ongoing lockout of the regular officials. The labor dispute is over money and other matters, and it has lasted for months. Will replacement refs mar NFL's first week? Not only that, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suggested during an open forum with fans at league headquarters in New York before the Cowboys-Giants game that he is willing to continue with the replacements to achieve a long-term solution. As for the short term, there is encouraging news for those who know replacement officials are just a ticking bomb waiting to explode with a slew of errors. And, no, the encouraging news isn't that both sides will punt away their labor squabbles anytime soon. The only silver (or shall we say black-and-white striped) lining is, the more the NFL uses replacement officials, the more folks will see the original ones were better than they thought. Union negotiator: NFL referees won't start season . I'm talking about MUCH better. This doesn't apply just to NFL officials, but to those of the NBA, the NHL and even baseball umpires, who have been known to have a few nose-to-nose chats with managers and players. For every time that an NBA referee goes blind when a Michael Jordan shoves away a Bryon Russell to sink a jumper to clinch a world championship, there are tens, hundreds and thousands of calls that are dead-on target. The same goes for baseball, where you've had the likes of umpire Jim Joyce ruining a perfect game for Armando Gallarraga by calling a base runner safe when he actually was out. Then in the NHL, there was Tony Sericolo's nonwhistle last season when the Philadelphia Flyers' Daniel Briere clearly was offside during a goal in a playoff game. The league issued a public apology to the losing Pittsburgh Penguins for the Sericolo gaffe, which was rare for NHL bosses to admit an officiating mistake. In fact, it is rare for those in charge of the other three major pro sports leagues in North America to do such a thing. There is no need to apologize when your regular officials give you no reason to do so more often than not. In contrast, history hasn't been kind to replacement officials. You can start with 1979, when baseball swapped its striking umpires with minor league umpires, who quickly felt the wrath of everybody in their new world for brutal calls. When the 45-day strike ended, baseball retained eight of the replacements, but they were shunned forever on and off the field by the returning umpires and derisively called ""scabs."" The NBA went the replacement route for 68 days during the 1995 season, and that was to the chagrin of those who disliked a massive increase in the amount of fouls called in games. At one point, the New York Knicks' Charles Oakley spoke boldly for his peers, telling reporters, ""They used five of these (replacements) to equal one of the regular refs. Terrible."" But back to the NFL, where I called Dan Reeves for some perspective on this officiating thing. He ranks among the league's all-time wise men, since he spent four decades in the NFL as an accomplished player, coach and administrator along the way to six Super Bowls. He also was associated with two of the NFL's most famous games -- as in the likely breeding grounds for officiating gaffes. There was the 1967 NFL championship game, which became known as the Ice Bowl. With the temperature in Green Bay, Wisconsin, at minus-15 below zero and a wind-child factor of minus 48, Reeves was a running back for a Dallas Cowboys team that eventually lost to the Packers during the frantic, famous and frigid last seconds. Then there was The Drive in 1987, when John Elway led a Denver Broncos team coached by Reeves 98 yards to victory inside the final minutes of the AFC Championship game in Cleveland. Any blown calls in either of those games? Reeves is still thinking. ""Golly, I don't remember anything that stuck out,"" said Reeves, still thinking from his home in Atlanta. Then Reeves recalled the NFC championship game in Minnesota after the 1998 regular season, when the Atlanta Falcons team he coached won an overtime thriller against the Vikings. He forced a chuckle, saying, ""No, I can't think of anything during that game, either."" You get the point. Oh, Reeves does remember his version of a phantom ""chop block"" called by an NFL official against offensive lineman Jumbo Elliott when Reeves coached the New York Giants in the early 1990s. He also remembers what he said was a shaky call after a kickoff during Super Bowl XXII in 1988, when his Denver Broncos lost to the Washington Redskins. Reeves laughed, saying, ""Yeah. You do have some bad calls that stick out, but I'll tell you what. When you've been involved in the NFL for 39 years, and when you can only think of maybe a handful of calls -- if that -- that you can say, 'Well, gosh. We lost that game because of a bad call or something,' I tell you right now: There aren't many of those. Those (regular) officials do a great job, no question about it."" That said, Reeves isn't totally against the replacements. As a traditionalist, he doesn't believe coaches or players should concentrate on the quality of officials, period. ""I know when I played for Coach (Tom) Landry (with the Cowboys during the 1960s), and when I coached, we didn't spent a whole lot of time on the officials,"" Reeves said. ""But as far as these new guys, there are a lot of them out there who just need an opportunity. You'll miss the experience, though, and they'll be taking more time making calls. The good thing is, the replay officials aren't on strike. They'll have them as a backup. ""But will they be as good as the guy who has been there doing for eight, nine, 10 years? I don't think so?"" Which is much of the point. Replacement refs bad business for NFL?","Terence Moore: NFL's exhibition season was filled with gaffes, bloopers .

"(CNN) -- Sony's PlayStation Vita, which hits stores in the U.S. and Europe next Wednesday, is much more than just another portable gaming device. With the Vita, Sony is trying to combine the power of its PlayStation home console with the interface, portability and social media features of a smartphone. With its innovative touch controls, OLED screen, motion sensors, social apps, GPS capability and dual cameras, it has most of the bells and whistles that today's gamers could want. Some industry observers question whether gamers will spring $250-$300 for another portable gaming device -- plus potential monthly fees for a 3G data plan -- when smartphones already handle many of the same gaming functions. But Sony is counting on the Vita's appeal to hard-core action- and first-person shooter gamers who want a designated mobile gaming system, not just another gadget on which to play ""Angry Birds."" CNN spent a week testing out the Vita on a handful of games. Our verdict: It's a powerful and promising device -- better suited to some games than to others -- whose ultimate success will depend on whether developers make enough worthy games for it. A social device . The successor to the Sony PSP hand-held console, PS Vita was started three years ago at the Sony Corporate Design Center by a team led by Takashi Sogabe, who designed the original Walkman. The goal was to bring richer and better gaming enjoyment than was available with the PSP. While members of the development team knew they'd be making upgrades to the hardware and gameplay, Shuhei Yoshida, president of SCE Worldwide Studios, said he knew social media capability was going to be just as important. ""It has Twitter. It has Flickr. Portable music applications. These are here to enhance your gameplay experience,"" Yoshida told CNN. ""What (Twitter) does as a player is, it lets you take a screen shot of a game you are playing. You beat the boss or you get the high score, (and) you can show the world what you've done with that screen shot."" Other social media applications, like Facebook, Foursquare and Skype, will also be available for download. The processing power in the Vita allows for eight different applications to run simultaneously. During our hands-on experience, we could download a new game while playing another and listening to music from the media player. There was no detectible slowing of the action or the music. PS Vita also raises the bar on mobile gaming by offering voice chat and text chat through the Party application. Party isn't tied into specific games, but allows players to communicate with their friends no matter what each person is doing. However, AT&T, the exclusive broadband provider for the Vita in the U.S., does impose some restrictions. Yoshida said voice chat will only work if one person is on a Wi-Fi connection and the other is on a 3G connection. As he reminded us, the Vita isn't a phone. Don't have many PlayStation friends online? Vita can help you find new connections with Near, a program that uses GPS to search your area for other nearby Vita devices. You can see what other people are playing, maybe join up for a multiplayer match or challenge a friend to top your high score. If you're concerned about privacy, there are ways to block your location, yet still see what's going on around you. Other features . All these additions to the gaming experience mean little if the core gameplay is lacking. And that's where the Vita really delivers. The seven-inch device is chock full of processing power, multiple controls and a 5-inch OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screen, all designed to make games look and play as well as they do on a PlayStation home console. The front of the Vita has two analog joysticks, a first for a portable gaming device, as well as a directional pad and four buttons. The front screen is also a touchscreen, allowing for direct control during a game. The back of the device is a touchpad, which can create some unintended gaming consequences when gripping the Vita. Because Sony wanted the back screen to have a one-to-one relationship with the game action, the rear touchpad takes up the same amount of room as the front screen. But it takes some creative holding of the device to play some games without accidentally tapping on the back. Yoshida said that while Vita does have a lot of input devices and functions, there were many others that didn't make it to the final design. He said the team focused on three things for the Vita: the size of the device, the price and its battery life. ""A certain group of us wanted a stylus,"" he said, laughing, about one feature that didn't make the cut. There are also two cameras, front and back, that are designed more for augmented reality (AR) gameplay than for taking quality pictures of your vacation spots. Three games that take advantage of augmented reality -- using a camera to overlay real-world objects onto a device's digital screen -- will be available at launch next week. Games . To consumers, all these features won't mean much if there aren't good games to play. Available at launch will be 25 titles, with many others scheduled for release shortly after. Sony is counting on some big franchises to help the Vita make a splash in the U.S. ""Assassin's Creed,"" ""Madden NFL,"" ""Uncharted,"" ""FIFA,"" ""Little Big Planet"" and ""BioShock"" are a few of the powerhouse series that are developing games for the Vita. Some are available now, and others are coming soon. Sony also is making some original games, mainly shooters and action-adventure titles, available at launch. At a recent demo in Washington, the new ""MLB 12: The Show"" showed how gamers can use the Vita's rear touchpad to throw the ball around a baseball diamond. Designer Ramone Russell said the PS3 version of the game will have 70 new enhancements and Vita will have 65 of those as well. He explained that the PS3 version and the Vita version of the game were designed with cross-play between the two consoles in mind. ""You dump 20, 30, 40 hours into a mode, and it's time to go on a business trip,"" Russell said. ""You save that file up into a Cloud. Pick up your PlayStation Vita. Take it on the road. Download it from the Cloud and you keep going. And it works vice versa."" After about a week of hands-on experience, the PS Vita feels less like a mobile gaming device and more like a new gaming console that is also portable. The social features and functionality are exciting, and their integration into games seems smooth. It takes a period of adjustment to avoid tapping the backside touchpad at the wrong time during a game. Even using the front touchscreen requires a bit of juggling, but it isn't anything that gets frustrating or awkward. Overall, the Vita's power, social integration and presentation make the device worth a look. But the lingering question is whether developers will create enough great Vita games to make it worth the money. The Wi-Fi version of the PS Vita will cost $249, while the AT&T 3G version will sell for $299 (plus a data plan). Two monthly data plans are available through AT&T: 250MB for $15 and 3GB for $30. There's also a first-edition bundle package that includes a PS Vita 3G/Wi-Fi model, 4GB memory card, ""Little Deviants"" game and a limited-edition case for $350. The deal expires at the end of March. Memory cards are needed for some Vita games, but not for all.","Sony's PlayStation Vita gaming device hits U.S. stores Wednesday .
Vita allows for eight different applications to run simultaneously .
The front has a touchscreen and two analog joysticks, a first for a portable gaming device .
Our verdict: Vita is a promising device whose success will depend on quality of its games ."

"(CNN) -- At least 330 people were reported dead Saturday in Syria, marking the highest single-day death toll since the start of the uprising, according to opposition activists. With one week left to go, August is already the deadliest month. Here are some of the other key developments on the crisis that is spiraling out of control: . On the ground: Deaths mount as assault intensifies . Saturday's death toll includes the bodies of more than 200 people that were found in and around Damascus, namely Daraya, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. It was unclear when those victims were killed. Saturday's death toll is the highest single-day figure since the start of the uprising, said a spokesman for the group. CNN is unable to independently verify reports of violence as Syria has severely limited access to international journalists. With one week left to go, August is already the deadliest month in Syria's 17-month crisis. Opposition activists report more than 3,700 people killed -- mostly civilians -- in just the past few weeks. Prior to Saturday, the single bloodiest day was reported on July 12. At least 287 people were killed then, including 220 in Hama province, according to the LCC. The Syrian military's frontal assault on the opposition appears to be ratcheting up, with indiscriminate bombings from jets and rockets fired into civilian areas. More than 10 missiles landed in Idlib province as planes opened fire with machine guns, the LCC said. Meanwhile, residents in Aleppo endured ""intense aerial shelling"" by a regime warplane Saturday, the group said. President Bashar al-Assad's government had a different take on the situation in Aleppo, the commercial and cultural heart of Syria. ""Armed forces continue pursuing terrorists in Aleppo and its countryside,"" state-run media proclaimed. ""Armed forces destroy seven cars equipped with machine guns, kill terrorists and seize their weapons in Aleppo city."" The region: Abducted Lebanese pilgrim freed . Hussein Ali Omar, one of 11 Lebanese Shiite pilgrims abducted in Syria, was in Turkey on Saturday after being released, according to a representative for Turkey's foreign minister. ""We are trying to get him to his country,"" the representative said. ""We think our efforts may have helped."" The Free Syrian Army has denied an allegation it was involved in the May abductions. The other 10 pilgrims are still being held. The development follows the kidnapping in Damascus of a Lebanese man, Hassan Salim Meqdad, by Syrian rebels who accused him of being a Hezbollah member. In response, Meqdad's brother, Hatem Meqdad, told Lebanon's state news agency that his family kidnapped 26 Syrians living in Lebanon. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, meanwhile, rejected claims that his country was shipping weapons to Syrian rebels in their quest to oust al-Assad, the Anadolu news agency reported. ""These are the arguments which authoritarian regimes had always used to conceal their internal problems,"" Davutoglu told the NTV news channel, according to Anadolu. Davutoglu added, ""No regime fighting its own people can survive long. (The al-Assad regime) has months, and maybe even weeks -- not years."" Diplomatic front: New envoy says Syrian people are 'our first masters' Lakhdar Brahimi is the new U.N. and Arab League envoy to Syria, but he said the Syrian people will be ""our first masters."" ""We will consider their interests above and before anyone else,"" the Algerian and longtime U.N. diplomat said Friday. Brahimi, who replaces Kofi Annan after months of fizzled attempts to broker peace in Syria, told U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon of his anxiety about the new post: . ""Secretary-general, when you called me, I told you that I was honored, flattered, humbled and scared, and still in that frame of mind. I will definitely give this my very, very best,"" Brahimi said. The Syrian crisis broke out in March 2011 after protesters, inspired by the success of popular uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, took to the streets demanding political reform and an end to four decades of al-Assad family rule. The movement devolved into an armed conflict after a brutal crackdown by al-Assad's forces. Opposition forces say more than 21,000 people have died. Syria 101: A crash course on the conflict .

"(CNN) -- For years, Kurt Sutter has told stories of criminal activity -- first as a writer for ""The Shield"" and then as the creator of FX's wildly popular ""Sons of Anarchy,"" a dramatized version of an outlaw biker gang in California. Now he's branching out and focusing his lens on real-life criminal organizations. The Discovery Channel recently premiered ""Kurt Sutter's Outlaw Empires,"" a six-part series that looks at the micro and macro reasons behind groups that have defined their existence outside the law. Episode one tackles famed Los Angeles gang the Crips, with subsequent shows exploring outlaw bikers, the Irish mob, the Italian mafia, the Nuestra Familia and the Aryan Brotherhood. ""On 'Sons,' we exposed a lot of people to a new world,"" Sutter told CNN from Los Angeles. ""It humanized what was a stereotype for a lot of people. Yes, our show is highly dramatic, and we take a lot of dramatic licenses. But the reality of it, and details of it are very true, very specific. For me, that's what I wanted to do with this series."" The show sprang from a different concept Sutter was pitching that looked at criminal activity from two points of view, the criminals and law enforcement. For the final act, the two sides would be brought together in the same room. ""The pitch was to have a high-level crime and get the point of view of the criminal party involved and law enforcement and hear their retelling of the same events,"" he said. ""People were intrigued by the concept, but ultimately it felt a little too old school. Discovery was interested in a variation, and they've wanted to do a high-end documentary series."" ""Outlaw Empires"" explores case studies of a few people involved in the criminal organization, using their stories and knowledge to make larger connections to the context of the outlaw group. Sutter pops up from time to time in cutaways to offer insights into the story he's trying to tell. He's not interested in getting law enforcement officials, psychologists or other talking heads to weigh in on why these people are ""bad."" Success, for Sutter, is telling a story that doesn't pass judgment. The approach that Sutter and his team took wasn't the typical ""let's pick a subject and tell their story"" usually associated with documentary storytelling. For him, they started small and worked outward. ""We tapped into people that had relationships; some of these guys have been cleaning up their acts -- there's networks to get to these people,"" Sutter said. ""We talked to people to see who had the most interesting story. It came out of character: who had the most interesting people with the most interesting stories. ""It wasn't so much like 'Let's go do the Crips. Let's go do the Aryan Brotherhood.' It was about let's cast a wide net and be led into the worlds by the characters."" Sutter is putting the finishing touches on the final episodes of ""Outlaw Empires"" while also in preproduction for the fifth season of ""Sons."" And like the way he portrays his fictional characters, he aims to give viewers a new look at a group of people who have been largely portrayed in a certain way. ""It's a challenging thing to do when you're dealing with guys covered in swastikas,"" Sutter said. ""You try to go in and give it some context, so people have some point of view to why people did what they did. It doesn't mean you're going to get behind it."" He added, ""The challenge is similar to writing 'Sons.' When you write an anti-hero, it's that balance between 'anti' and 'hero.' You can't make them too righteous and good so they don't feel dangerous or believable. But you can't write them so deplorable that the audience can't get behind them. It's similar with this series.""

"(CNN) -- Napoli joined Juventus at the top of Italy's Serie A after an Edinson Cavani hat-trick blew away Lazio in a 3-0 victory at the Stadio San Paolo. The hosts' fourth win in five league games takes them to 13 points, with only a missed penalty from Cavani denying Walter Mazzarri's side from taking top spot outright in the Italian championship. The Uruguayan became the league's top scorer with five goals after racing to his hat-trick in just over an hour but he blazed a 75th minute spot-kick over the bar. Napoli, who remain unbeaten, now share an identical record of eleven goals scored and two conceded with reigning champions Juventus, who drew 0-0 at Fiorentina on Tuesday. Lazio -- whose German striker Miroslav Klose earned praise after admitting to match officials that he had used his hand when bundling the ball home early on -- suffered their second loss in as many games after starting their campaign with three straight wins. Meanwhile, AC Milan relieved some of the pressure on embattled coach Massimiliano Allegri when beating ten-man Cagliari 2-0 at the San Siro to move tenth in the table. Allegri watched from the sidelines as he served a touchline ban issued after he made heated protests to officials during Sunday's defeat at Udinese but he would have been delighted to see striker Stephan El Shaarawy grab a double -- and was further boosted by the return of Brazil's Robinho after a month-long injury. Both Allegri and Milan went into the game knowing that a win was imperative after defeats in their opening games at the San Siro stadium -- against Sampdoria and Atalanta -- had led to the club's worst home start to a season in over 80 years. The win also meant that one of Milan and Inter, who share the San Siro, had finally won a game -- at the tenth time of asking -- after the installation of a new partially-synthetic pitch over the summer. Having suffered a shock home defeat against Siena on Sunday, Inter responded by moving up to fourth after winning 2-0 at Chievo, thanks to goals from Alvaro Pereira and Antonio Cassano. In the Italian capital, Sampdoria protected their unbeaten record as they recovered from going behind to a first half Francesco Totti goal to draw 1-1 at Roma and take third spot, three points behind the leaders. Elsewhere, Catania beat Atalanta 2-1, Geno drew 1-1 with Parma, Torino and Udinese played out a goalless draw while Pescara beat ten-man Palermo 1-0 thanks to a late strike from Wladimir Weiss. There was just one game in Spain where Atletico Madrid went second in La Liga, and six points clear of city rivals Real, after winning 4-2 at Real Betis. Colombian striker Radamel Falcao scored twice to overtake Lionel Messi at the top of La Liga's scoring charts, with Atletico's thirteen points now just two fewer than Barcelona. In Germany, Szabolcs Huszti and Didier Ya Konan kept Hanover among the league leaders, scoring or assisting in all four goals as the team beat Nuremberg 4-1 at home. Bayern Munich top the Bundesliga after winning their opening five games, but Hanover moved third as Konan's brace and one from the Hungarian Huszti took their points tally to ten for the season. Hamburg moved out of the bottom three after drawing 2-2 at Borussia Monchengladbach, with former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Rafael van der Vaart opening the scoring for the visitors.","Napoli beat visitors Lazio 3-0 to go joint top of Serie A with reigning champions Juventus .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- The United Nations condemned a suicide bombing in Somalia's capital that killed a number of people, including three journalists from state-run broadcasting services, as a ""cowardly attack."" The U.N. special representative to Somalia made the comments following the attack Thursday that saw a pair of suicide bombers blew themselves up inside a packed teahouse near Mogadishu's presidential palace. ""I strongly condemn this cowardly and senseless attack. These acts of terrorism cannot reverse the recent achievements that Somalia has witnessed,"" Augustine P. Mahiga said in a statement released Thursday. ""Such incidents can only reinforce the determination of the Somali people to reject violence and engage in peaceful resolution of conflict."" State-run Radio Mogadishu reported identified two of the dead as Liban Ali Nur, news director and anchor for Somalia's national television network, and Abdisatar Dahir Sabrieye, an anchor and producer who recently returned to war-torn Somalia after exile in neighboring Kenya. The head of another radio station, the Voice of Democracy, also died in the blast, and four other journalists were wounded, three critically, the network reported. A witness said the cafe was spattered with blood and pieces of bodies. Soldiers killed in blast targeting new Somali president . The National Union of Somali Journalists said the bombings took place just after sunset and that the al-Shabaab jihadist movement had claimed responsibility for the attack. ""We strongly condemn this attack on journalists. We are absolutely convinced that this was a targeted attack on journalists,"" said Omar Faruk Osman, the group's secretary-general. Somalia's shaky transitional government, backed by African Union peacekeepers, has been battling Islamic guerrillas for years. The country has lacked an effective central government since 1991, with portions of the Horn of Africa nation left lawless. More than 40 journalists have been killed in Somalia since 1992, making it one of the world's most dangerous places for reporters, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Osman said 12 have died so far this year -- ""the single deadliest year for journalists in the history of our country."" Somalia picks political newcomer as president in landmark vote .

"London (CNN) -- From movie stars and business moguls to politicians and pop stars, the British press has never shied away from picturing famous figures in compromising positions. Until now, that is. Once upon a time, grainy shots of celebrities flashing their birthday suits or falling out of skimpy outfits were the stock-in trade of titles like The Sun and The Daily Mail. And the royal family was by no means immune: Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, have all been caught up in tabloid scandals -- with or without embarrassing photos to accompany them -- in the past. But offered the chance to splash images of Prince Harry cavorting in the nude with a naked woman during a trip to Las Vegas across their front pages this week, the UK's papers have hesitated, apparently genuinely puzzled as to whether to ""publish and be damned."" So what has changed? The British media landscape has altered beyond recognition since the death of Harry's mother, Princess Diana, killed in a car crash as she fled a crowd of photographers in Paris 15 years ago. The shock of that accident provoked an immediate backlash against both the paparazzi, and the tabloids that bought their pictures. But its impact was not a lasting one: Within months, the papers were back to their old tricks, and the punters were happy to pay for them. Photos of naked Prince Harry published . The real watershed has come in the last 18 months, with the discovery of the full scale of the phone-hacking scandal (initially revealed by the hacking of Prince William and Prince Harry's mobile phones), which forced the closure of the News of the World, and prompted the Leveson Inquiry into press standards. Following months of evidence detailing the dirty tricks and devastation wrought by some members of the gutter press, Lord Leveson is currently deciding whether to recommend new rules and regulations, governing the conduct of the UK media. Until his report is ready, analysts believe, editors simply don't want to upset the applecart. Anonymous Fleet Street columnist Fleet Street Fox wrote in her blog that newspapers have been ""painted into a corner, with one eye on their budgets which mean they need to avoid unnecessary court costs, and another on the line they don't want to cross before that report is written, just in case they make things any worse."" Neil Wallis, former deputy editor of The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World, tweeted that the pictures were the ""perfect example of how #Leveson has cowed our media... Rest of world discussing pix no-one dares show you here."" In a blog for the Huffington Post, Wallis said the dilemma over whether to use the Prince Harry photographs was ""nothing to do with journalistic merit, nothing to do with the merits of the story, nothing to do with legal issues, nothing even to do with journalistic ethics... ""The decisions are being reached on the basis of: 'What will Lord Leveson think?' And that is shocking, it is outrageous, it is a disgraceful affront to free speech."" Political blogger Guido Fawkes -- whose site was one of the few in the UK to run the pictures in defiance of requests from the palace -- wrote that ""the old media have been scared into submission by the Leveson Inquiry."" Much of the debate over whether to run the pictures or not centers on the question of privacy: Despite his very public role, Prince Harry was on a private visit to the U.S., and the photographs were taken in his hotel suite. Pending any changes in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, British newspaper editors are bound by the Press Complaints Commission's Code of Practice, which insists that ""everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life,"" and that ""it is unacceptable to photograph individuals in private places without their consent."" There is a get-out clause, in the shape of exceptions for cases ""in the public interest."" In the past, the fact that the prince was supposed to be being watched over by a very large and very expensive security team at the time the pictures were taken would certainly have been enough to ensure their publication. Royal correspondent Robert Jobson said that team of minders had questions to answer: ""Why didn't royal bodyguards ask anyone going into Harry's suite to handover their phones for security,"" he tweeted. ""Would prevent all this."" But long-time royal expert Dickie Arbiter said both Prince Harry and his entourage should have known they could not expect what went on in Vegas to stay in Vegas. ""Privacy when you're Prince Harry and globe-trotting doesn't exist,"" he tweeted. ""It was a private trip but he's a loose canon [sic] and shouldn't be left alone."" Embarrassing pics could harm a soldier's career several ways . Some commentators also suggest part of the reason for the British media's hesitation is the fact that, in the wake of a series of good news stories including the Diamond Jubilee, the royals' stock is higher now than it has been in decades. Writing in the New Statesman, Steven Baxter claimed the papers were refusing to use the pictures not out of ""fear of regulators but fear of their own readers,"" adding that Prince Harry and his kin ""are celebrities, like others, but untouchable ones."" And Jules Stenson, former features editor of the News of the World, said Harry's popularity -- which endures largely because of his Jack-the-Lad image, not in spite of it -- means he is unlikely to suffer any lasting damage from the incident. ""Public love Harry & we shouldn't forget his bravery in serving,"" Stenson tweeted. ""But big gaffe.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea captain John Terry was charged by the English Football Association (FA) Friday over his verbal clash with Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during a Premier League match last year. Terry was cleared by a London court last month of racially abusing Ferdinand in the incident, but the FA has decided to take its own action after seeking independent legal advice. ""It is alleged that Terry used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behavior towards Queens Park Rangers' Anton Ferdinand, contrary to FA rules,"" read an FA statement. ""It is further alleged that this included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or color and/or race of Anton Ferdinand. ""This charge is the result of The FA's long-standing enquiries into this matter, which were placed on hold pending the outcome of the criminal trial, and relates to rules governing football only. "" Terry said Friday that he denied the charges and would be requesting a personal hearing. He was found not guilty after a five-day trial at Westminster Magistrates Court which went into precise detail about the circumstances of the disagreement between the two players during the televised match on October 23 last year. Terry was stripped of the England captaincy in February over the allegations, leading to the subsequent resignation of national team manager Fabio Capello, just months before Euro 2012. Terry played in the finals under new manager Roy Hodgson while awaiting his criminal trial. Meanwhile, Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri was given a three-match international ban by the French Football Federation over his behavior at Euro 2012. Nasri mouthed an obscenity to a television camera after scoring France's equalizer in the 1-1 draw against England in the group stages. He also insulted a journalist after France lost in the quarterfinals to Spain. He will miss World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Belarus in September, but will be available for a rematch against Spain in October. French teammate Jeremy Menez received a one-match ban for his clash with captain Hugo Lloris in the Spanish defeat.","English FA charge John Terry over his clash with Anton Ferdinand .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sixteen years is a long time, but ""it still feels just like yesterday"" to 39-year-old Penny Malphrus. Her father disappeared while flying home from Swainsboro, Georgia, to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, in February 1996. ""I honestly do not know where the time has gone,"" she said this week, as efforts continued to determine whether plane wreckage recently found 80 feet down in the Atlantic Ocean 20 miles off the coast of St. Augustine, Florida, will answer her family's uncertainty. ""I may or may not find my answers in my search, but I really feel like I am not alone searching,"" she said. Read more: Underwater wreckage could provide answer to missing-plane mystery . On February 17, 1996, Malphrus' father, Stewart Dunbar, was piloting his twin engine Piper Aerostar home after going to show the plane to a prospective buyer who failed to show up for the scheduled appointment. Shortly after he took off around 7:45 p.m., Dunbar, 58, reported feeling dizzy and said he was having trouble seeing. He radioed a distress call and advised the radio control tower in Jacksonville, Florida, of his coordinates. In what would be his last communication, he said he was placing the plane on autopilot and turning toward the ocean. Then, several weeks ago, diver Joe Kistel and another diver came across plane parts which Malphrus hopes will shed more light on where and how her father's plane disappeared. Kistel posted video and photos on his company's website, hoping it might draw attention from aviation buffs. See the photos and videos . Malphrus, who routinely checks the Internet for any news about missing aircraft, heard about the plane wreckage and decided she wanted to meet the 31-year-old Kistel before he made the dive to further investigate the wreckage. ""This could be it. This dive could be what ultimately answers 16 years of not knowing,"" Malphrus e-mailed to CNN prior to her face-to-face meeting with Kistel. ""If it is my Dad's plane, I want to (meet) the man before he goes to find that my Dad has actually touched the face of God. Somehow it seems comforting to me."" ""I guess I feel like if I can't be the person to go dive down there and find the answers myself, then what I really want is for that person to at least know me and more about my Dad and what an incredible person my Dad is,"" she said. ""Right now, to me, my Dad is still alive, so this for me could be my goodbye."" The weather looks favorable this weekend for Kistel and a volunteer search and recovery team from TISIRI (Think It Sink It Reef It), a marine conservation company based in Jacksonville, which has unexpectedly found itself in the middle of an underwater mystery, far from its main mission to help build artificial reefs. On Wednesday afternoon, Malphrus drove the three-and-a-half hours that separates her home from the man who might provide the closure she's looking for. Kistel and Malphrus both predicted their first meeting would be emotional. ""I was greeted by a man with a very sweet smile and what started as a handshake turned into a comforting hug,"" she reflected. ""I instantly felt comfortable like I had known him for years."" She said she could tell instantly Kistel takes a lot of pride in what he does. ""For me to see her kinda stepped things up a level,"" Kistel later said. ""Through our conversation ... you would see the hope and the sadness at the same time. Seeing her emotions was very motivating for us."" But he also didn't want to raise expectations. ""He was very careful to not give me false hopes,"" she said. But Malphrus said it was important that Kistel knows everything about her father. ""This isn't just anyone he is diving down there looking for. This could be my Dad. Joe could be diving down to find the last answer I may need. I want to know Joe."" Wishful thinking aside, the two principals in this drama were realistic about how it may turn out. The chances that this is the plane are hard to know because no one saw exactly where it went down. Not long after communications were lost with Dunbar, fighter jets were scrambled. A Falcon jet based in Charleston, South Carolina, went out as soon as the report came in while the plane was still over land, Malphrus recalls. Then two C-130's were scrambled including one off a Navy ship to relieve the Coast Guard's Falcon which was running low on fuel. ""The first jet did get a visual,"" said Malphrus, but since night had fallen, the pilot was unable to see inside the cockpit, lit only by the light from the instrument panel. ""From what I understood, the two C-130 jets never could find him again. This has always led me to believe his Aerostar may not have stayed on the course they predicted with his last known coordinates and estimated fuel expiration recorded in his flight plan."" One of the more emotional moments during their three-hour meeting occurred when Kistel pulled out of a bag a piece of the Lycoming engine retrieved during the initial dive last month. ""She held it in her hand knowing this could be a piece of her father's plane,"" said Kistel. ""I got a little tearful looking at this sand and shell encrusted piece of wreckage balanced in Joe's hand. That was a moment where the reality of there is really wreckage down there and it could be my Dad's kinda merged into my reality. Seeing that piece was at best indescribable,"" Malphrus said. Kistel said the plan is for a team of at least six divers to go down three times for up to 30 minutes each on Saturday and then again on Sunday. Kistel said they will use Saturday's dive to locate, mark and rig cables to the two engines which are 38 feet apart and 75% buried in the sand. Using lift bags that are like giant inflatable pillows provided free of charge by two companies, Prolift and Subsalve, Kistel will attempt to place the two engines on blocks on the level sea floor to get a better look at the motors, the propellers and any possible serial numbers. Each of the propellers on the two engines of Dunbar's plane had three blades. ""If that engine comes out and it's a two-bladed prop, we can pretty much conclude it was not Penny's father's plane,"" Kistel said. ""If it's three-bladed, it means more investigation."" Ironically, CNN coverage about the plane's disappearance and dive has resulted in more than a dozen other families contacting Kistel, wondering if perhaps the plane wreckage is related to their missing loved ones. Whether it turns out to be Dunbar's plane, Kistel said, ""The goal is to identify the plane. It won't change anything on our end."" ""If it is not his plane, then it is somebody else's answer, someone else's closure,"" Malphrus said. Kistel said his company and others are shouldering the costs of the search. ""Every dollar spent is a financial loss as it is not like we are recovering treasure or goods of fiscal value. The hope of providing someone or some family closure is keeping us motivated and moving forward regardless,"" he acknowledges. ""The reality will most likely be that we will be unable to pursue investigations (after this weekend) without support of fiscal sponsors."" Back at her home in Hilton Head Island, waiting to see what Kistel finds, Malphrus can only wonder. She said she's going to drive back to Jacksonville this weekend. ""You know I sit in my dad's old chair, I still have his hair brush, I even have an old undershirt sealed in a Ziplock bag that still has his smell, but I don't have him. I never got to say goodbye,"" she said. ""I have so many things that he touched and that were his, but so far none of these things has been enough to take away this pain of just not knowing.""","Pilot Stewart Dunbar disappeared off Florida coast in 1996 .

"(CNN) -- Dear Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, . As much as America is looking forward to 10 more weeks of soothing campaign rhetoric (fingernails on the blackboard of America's psyche), I write to urge you to offer the nation a compelling vision for a common-sense immigration process. Your respective parties' conventions would be a great place to start. First off, you should know that poll after poll shows a broad spectrum of Americans want a rational immigration process. In fact, a recent Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that immigration was one of only a few public policy issues where, as the Post put it, ""rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats are less divided."" A creative approach to immigration may not play to your parties' fringes, but a clear majority of Americans want a pragmatic federal immigration policy. Yet while the immigration solutions are simple, changing the conversation is not. Opinion: Is Ryan an immigration pragmatist? Let's start with what it means to be an American. The United States is a nation of values, founded on an idea: that all men and women are created equal. That all people have rights, no matter what they look like or where they came from. It's not about what religion you follow or where you were born that makes you American -- it's how you live your life and your dedication to American ideals. Americans believe families should stick together, we should look out for one another, and hard work deserves reward. These are the reasons America is destination No. 1 for the best, brightest and hardest working from around the world. How you treat new American immigrants reflects your commitment to these values that define us as Americans. As president, how will you ensure that no aspiring American lives in the shadows, and that there is a road map to citizenship for the undocumented? The same is true today as it has been throughout history: People move to make life better for themselves and their families. People come to America not only for the promise of freedom but also to put food on the table and to send their kids to a decent school. And to rebuild our economy, we need new Americans as customers, innovators, taxpayers and workers. According to a report out this month from the Partnership for a New American Economy, immigrants launched 28% of the country's new businesses in 2011 despite accounting for less than 13% of the U.S. population. The organization found that immigrant-owned firms now generate more than $775 billion in revenue, $125 billion in payroll and $100 billion in income. But immigrant entrepreneurs are just one part of a 21st-century economy. For example, a July economic analysis by the BBVA Bancomer Foundation and Mexico Economic Studies Department of BBVA Research found that Mexican immigrants are responsible for 18% of our gross domestic product in agriculture, forestry or fishing. In other words, ""nearly one fifth of the national value added of agriculture in the U.S. comes from the work of Mexican immigrants."" Rest assured that Americans of all stripes hunger for a new consensus on immigration. Earlier this summer, Focus on the Family's president, Jim Daly, told Christianity Today, ""In terms of immigration, our system, our process is not working well. It's broken. We need to find new answers to this."" Opinion: Today, America welcomes young immigrants . Meanwhile, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a June statement, ""We call on both parties to work with the president toward a legislative solution that will address the parents and families of these immigrant youth, and the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows."" All of us who believe so strongly in America's promise deserve from you an immigration process where all of us live our lives openly, participate fully in our communities and serve our country together. Gentlemen, to be specific, this process must enforce the rule of law so all Americans are treated justly, create legal immigration opportunities that serve the needs of our economy and create a line for the undocumented to become full-fledged Americans. The status quo fails to meet this standard. America will be a more vital nation when you engage in a debate that honors our common values and common history, and from which emerge pragmatic immigration solutions that lead us forward together. Sincerely, . Ali Noorani . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ali Noorani.","Ali Noorani: Nation needs a compelling vision for a common-sense immigration process .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A criminal court in Turkey brought the hammer down hard on hundreds of acting and retired senior military commanders, found guilty of plotting to overthrow the government, state media reported Friday. Three-hundred-thirty of the 365 suspects were sentenced to up to two decades behind bars, in a trial reflecting the relatively new reduction of military influence in the nation's political landscape. Former air force commander Ibrahim Firtina, former head of the navy Ozden Ornek and an ex-army commander named Cetin Dogan had their initial life sentences reduced to 20 years, according to state media. Analysts say the plot -- widely referred to as Balyoz, or ""Sledgehammer"" in English -- further reinforces the shift in a balance of power oriented toward more civilian authority. Six other generals and one former member of parliament were sentenced to 18 years in prison, while 34 others were acquitted and another defendant was separated from the case. Dozens of military commanders -- once considered untouchable in Turkish society -- have been in prison for more than two years as the controversial trial dragged on. ""The decision seems to be designed to set a precedent and give a strong signal to the armed forces that the days of meddling in politics are over,"" wrote Suat Kiniklioglu, a senior member of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, in an e-mail to CNN. ""Anyone attempting to discredit or overthrow a democratically-elected government in the future will think twice. ... I think it is clear the judiciary is intent on consolidating the gains it made over the deep state and its military wing in recent years."" From outside the remote prison on the outskirts of Istanbul where the trial was held, Turkish television broadcast live images of despondent relatives after the verdict was announced. Some wept, while a woman could be seen being carried out of the building after she apparently collapsed. If the sentences are upheld, some of the elderly former commanders are likely to live the rest of their lives behind bars. ""The murder of justice turned into a massacre of justice with the decision given today,"" a defense attorney named Huseyin Ersoz said, reading what he described as a joint statement from many of the defendants. ""We have never betrayed our country, nation, state and flag."" Related story: Will Turkey have soft landing or turbulence? The Sledgehammer investigation dates back to 2003 and marks a sizable setback for the once politically dominant Turkish armed forces, which have overthrown four governments in the last half-century. The widely-watched trial demonstrated a victory in the ongoing power struggle between the country's long-ruling secular elite and the Islamist-inspired elected government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan, who was jailed in the 1990s for reading a poem about Islam in public, sparred with military commanders during his first years in office. But after handily winning consecutive elections, he has succeed in cowing the military during nearly 10 years in office, arguably becoming the most powerful politician Turkey has seen in generations. In 2011, Erdogan enjoyed strong support in parliamentary elections, edging the nation away from its traditionally securalist leanings. In a statement to journalists on Friday, Erdogan appeared to suggest the sentences could be diminished through an appeals process. ""We have to watch and see the appeals process as well,"" Erdogan said. ""Our wish is for a just decision to come out of this. But it has not come to an end yet because there is an ongoing process."" Related story: Turkey's Kurdish conflict has turned more violent, says report . While the arrest of the generals was welcomed in some circles, other liberal voices in the Turkish media have criticized the conduct of the trial as well as the evidence presented. ""The sentence was too harsh and confirms the opinion of many people in Turkey who believe this was essentially an attempt to settle political scores with the ancien regime, as opposed to being a fair trial,"" said Asli Aydintasbas, a columnist with the newspaper Milliyet. ""This is not to whitewash the military role in Turkey's past. ... But some of the evidence presented in this case would not hold in a court of law in any other country."" Thought to be crucial to NATO interests given its geostrategic significance -- Turkey borders Iraq and Syria to the south and Russia to its northeast -- the stability of the country's democratic government has long remained a concern of foreign policy experts.

"(CNN) -- Day Two of the Republican National Convention brings another round of trivia and more you may not know about women candidates, keynote ambitions, and celebrity vote getters. Convention firsts . • New York Rep. Geraldine Ferraro's nomination for vice president at the 1984 Democratic convention marked the first time a woman was named to a major party ticket. In 2008, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin became the first woman named to a GOP ticket. • In 1964, Maine Sen. Margaret Chase Smith was officially placed in nomination for the presidency at the Republican convention. This marked the first time a woman's name was placed in nomination by a major political party. Smith won 27 votes. Sen. Barry Goldwater was the nominee. • Laura Clay received one delegate vote for president in 1920 at the Democratic convention in San Francisco -- the first time a woman ever received a vote for president at a major party convention. • In 1940, although Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt had not publicly indicated that he would seek reelection, he won the first ballot handily with only 13 delegates opposing him. He became the first president to be nominated for a third term. • Attempting to become the first woman to speak at a major party convention, Susan B. Anthony requested in 1868 that she be allowed to address the Democratic delegates on the cause of women's suffrage. It was denied. • Dorothy Bush was elected secretary of the Democratic National Committee in 1944 and at 27 was the youngest person and first woman to be elected an officer of either major political party. Bush served as party secretary until 1989 and called the roll at every Democratic convention for 40 years. My Faith: My Sikh prayer for the Republican National Convention (another first) Convention keynote speaker facts . • Sixteen keynote speakers have gone on to run for president but only two have won their party's nomination: Warren G. Harding (1916 GOP keynote speaker, 1920 presidential nominee) and Barack Obama (2004 Democratic keynote speaker; 2008 presidential nominee) Convention coverage milestones . • In 1844, the news of Henry Clay's presidential nomination by the Whigs was telegraphed from Maryland, where the convention was held, to the U.S. Capitol. • National political conventions were covered on radio for the first time in 1924. Christie: Romney will 'tell us the hard truths' • National political conventions were covered on television for the first time in 1948. Convention Timing . • 2012 marks the fifth time that the two major party conventions have been held on back-to-back weeks. This also happened in 1912, 1916, 1956 and 2008. Longest and shortest conventions . • The Democratic convention in New York in 1924 was the longest in history -- 17 days. • The Democratic convention in Baltimore in 1872 was the shortest in history -- six hours. By the numbers: Republican convention . • The 2012 Democratic convention is scheduled for three days. This would be the shortest for the party since 1948, which was also three days. The 1972 GOP convention lasted three days. The 2008 GOP convention was four days, but the first day's program was abbreviated due to a Gulf Coast storm, Hurricane Gustav. Weird convention moments . • In 2000, Vice President Al Gore gave his wife, Tipper, a long kiss before delivering his acceptance speech for the Democratic presidential nomination. • At the 1972 Republican convention, President Richard Nixon appeared before delegates in a live television hookup while speaking to a group of young Republicans. During the telecast, singer Sammy Davis Jr. gave Nixon a bear hug. • Because of a long roll call during the 1972 vice presidential balloting, Democratic Sen. George McGovern did not start his acceptance speech until 3 a.m. ET, long after the national television audience had gone to bed. • People who received unexpected votes for president or vice president at Democratic or Republican conventions include: Writer Hunter S. Thompson, football great Roger Staubach, Judge Robert Bork, newsmen David Brinkley and Roger Mudd, writer William F. Buckley, fictional TV character 'Archie Bunker,' pediatrician/author Dr. Benjamin Spock and novelist George Orwell.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When Meb Keflezighi visited the White House this week, shaking hands with President Obama and milling around with the rest of the U.S. Olympic Team, he had no medal to show off. And yet, he is undeniably a champion. Just over five and a half feet tall and less than 130 pounds, he is a running marvel who has shocked the Olympic community by putting American marathoners back in contention after many years of also-rans. And he's 37. ""I kind of fell into it by accident,"" Keflezighi says with the broad, infectious smile that he carries everywhere. ""And now look at me."" Keflezighi's journey to the running record books has been a long, amazing trip. When he was just a child growing up in the African nation of Eritrea, his family went on the run to escape wars at home. Landing first in Italy, they soon made their way to the United States where they found refuge, but Keflezighi also found himself a stranger in a strange land. He spoke virtually no English, his family had no money, and he was not a runner. He became one the day a gym teacher challenged his class to run a mile as hard as possible. Keflezighi took off chasing a good grade, and ended up clocking a dazzling 5:20. ""I just ran as hard as I could to get an A because that's what my parents expected of me,"" he says, laughing at his youthful exuberance. Through high school and college, he grew more serious about running and much faster, capturing repeated NCAA championships. By 2004, he was in the Olympics, winning silver in Athens, the first marathon medal for the United States since the legendary Frank Shorter in the 1970s. In 2008, Keflezighi broke his hip while running in the Olympic trials and failed to make the team, although he still finished eighth. The next year he won the New York Marathon, the first American to accomplish that feat in almost 30 years. This year he became the oldest marathoner ever to win the U.S. Olympic trials, leading the team into London. There, he went out to lead early in a hot race, developed side stitches and fell back in the middle miles while the vaunted Kenyans and the Ugandan runner who would eventually grab gold surged ahead. Keflezighi seemed, as the race announcers had predicted, doomed to a top 20 finish at best. But even back in the middle of the pack, he was far from done. As the cobblestones ripped at his feet causing excruciating blood blisters, he pushed on. The other two Americans dropped out with injuries, and Keflezighi considered it, too. ""I did think of dropping out at mile 15, but I said, 'That's not my best.' I said, 'We are going to represent our country best, and stopping was not our best.'"" Keflezighi started passing more and more runners. And shortly after the bronze medalist stepped over the line, unbelievably, here came Keflezighi, grinning, waving and streaking in for a fourth-place finish. He grabbed an American flag and held it high for the adoring crowd. His feet were so damaged he had to ride a wheelchair through the airport to board his flight home, but he'd once again proven that he belongs among the greatest marathoners on the planet, something that virtually no other American runner has been able to say for decades. Like the title of his book, ""Run to Overcome,"" suggests, Keflezighi has simply never learned to quit. ""I always say 'Run to win,' and that's the best I can do."" So while he brought no medal to the White House reception, at an age when many athletes have already retired, he brought something just as valuable: A fourth-place finish in a race that defied American mastery.","Olympic runner Meb Keflezighi escaped war-torn Eritrea as a child .

"(CNN) -- Two men were being questioned Thursday by Mexican authorities about a shooting that killed a U.S. Border Patrol agent and wounded another near the U.S.-Mexican border in Arizona, a source in the Mexican attorney general's office said. The Mexican army handed over to local authorities in Sonora two men they had detained near the American border, the source in the federal department said Thursday. The two were in possession of drugs and guns when they were detained, added the source. Local authorities are investigating if the pair had anything to do with Tuesday's shooting near Naco, Arizona, where Border Patrol agents came under fire after responding to a sensor that had gone off nearby. U.S. authorities have identified the agent killed as 30-year-old Nicholas Ivie. The Provo, Utah, native, who joined the Border Patrol in January 2008, is survived by his wife and two young children. Ivie is the 14th agent killed in the line of duty since 2008, including three this year. He was killed near a border station recently named for Brian Terry, whose 2010 death led to the public disclosure of the botched Fast and Furious gun-smuggling sting, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. What was 'Fast and Furious'? The agent who was wounded has not been identified. After the shooting, he was airlifted to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. He was released from the hospital Wednesday, said Jeremy Copeland, an agent with the Tucson Sector of U.S. Border Patrol. In addition to Mexican authorities, the FBI is conducting a joint investigation with the Cochise County Sheriff's Office. James Turgal, special agent in charge of the FBI's Phoenix division, has declined to say if the Border Patrol agents involved in the incident returned fire. As of Wednesday, investigators had not found the weapon used in the shooting, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Lanny Breuer, assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, said earlier this week that investigators were at the scene. ""Every time that a law enforcement person is either killed or shot or injured in the line of duty, we have to take a moment and think of our families and think of the heroes involved,"" Breuer said.

"(CNN) -- The two major parties in Georgia each claimed victory in the nation's historic parliamentary elections as officials worked through the night to count the ballots. The ruling United National Movement and the Georgian Dream Coalition both said it would win a majority of seats in the new 150-member body. Billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili, who leads the underdog ""Georgian Dream"" alliance, claimed exit polls showed his alliance would win 100 seats. President Mikheil Saakashvili conceded his rivals would win most of the seats apportioned by vote percentages but said he expected his group would gain most of 73 seats decided by majority vote. In Georgia, voters pick a candidate for their district and also vote for a party list. Polls closed at 8 p.m. (noon ET) and results were expected Tuesday. An official from the Georgian Central Election Commission said that 61% of eligible voters took part in the election. Both sides poured large amounts of money into the election. The government's Central Electoral Commission has been professional and independent, however, said Lorne Craner, president of the International Republican Institute, a U.S. congressionally funded democracy support organization. ""There's no question in my mind ... the election commission can be relied upon."" ""But the question is will everyone stay calm when the results come out,"" Craner, who is in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, added. Observers: Georgia opposition may be premature in declaring victory . The result will affect the structure of political power in the southwest Asian nation, and the role of the presidency -- almost nine years after the Rose Revolution brought Saakashvili to power. The new parliament will be elected as the country prepares to usher in constitutional changes that will go into effect once Saakashvili's term ends in 2013. The new system, according to Thomas de Waal, an expert on Georgia and senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, will shift power from the president to a prime minister. ""The prime minister will be chosen by parliament, which thus hands important powers to whichever political force obtains a majority in parliament in the October 1 elections,"" de Waal said. ""Parliament will be the main body running Georgia, so it will be a much more diluted power,"" Saakashvili said. ""There will no longer be a strong man or stakeholder of power and I think that is a fair system because in democracy there are checks and balances for different people."" Until recently, Saakashvili and the United National Movement have controlled much of political life in this country of 4.5 million people and has been praised by U.S. and European officials for making progress in the fight against corruption and continuing economic reform. The evidence can be seen in gleaming new skyscrapers. But critics, who have coalesced into the ""Georgian Dream"" alliance led by Ivanishvili, say reform is only skin-deep, charging that Saakashvili is pulling all the levers of Soviet-style ""administrative measures."" They have raised concerns about a level playing field for the opposition during this election, alleging harassment and limitations on their access to the media. High stakes in polarized election . For his part, Saakashvili refers to the opposition leader Ivanishvili as that ""big money guy."" The president accuses Ivanishvili of wanting to ""buy the whole system,"" and sees the hand of Russia behind him, with which Georgia fought a brief but bitter war four years ago. The president said he is concerned with the amount of wealth that Ivanishvili made in Russia, and that that money is being used to influence the elections. ""We know what Russian money is all about,"" he said. ""How it was made, what kind of methods were used, and certainly it is a source of concern,"" he said. Those charges are false stereotypes, Ivanishvili told CNN in a phone interview from the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. A self-made businessman who made his money in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union, Ivanishvili left Russia shortly after Vladimir Putin came to power. His staff confirms his status as Georgia's richest man, with a fortune estimated at approximately $6.4 billion, equal to almost half of Georgia's economic output. ""It's not money and wealth which is my capital,"" he said. ""It's trust from the people toward me. Money has nothing to do with this."" The billionaire said he has sold all his Russian assets, and defended his reputation. But the president insisted that not only the opposition leader but Putin himself is trying to undermine Georgia. ""Vladimir Putin said clearly that he is interested in the Georgian election outcome. He clearly said that he wanted the Georgian government out. He clearly said that he wanted me to be physically destroyed, he said it publicly,"" Saakashvili said. Georgia's electoral waters have been roiled by a shocking video that emerged last month showing abuse in a Georgian prison, including one male prisoner being sexually assaulted. The opposition claims the video is proof of a repressive system put in place by Saakashvili and his government. Former Georgian prison guard: I witnessed abuse for years . Saakashvili said his government acted quickly and decisively to the video, citing an investigation that has led to arrests. ""Not only were the immediate perpetrators arrested,"" he said, ""but two government ministers resigned because they shared political responsibility for allowing the system to fail."" Read more: Georgia interior minister quits over prisoner abuse videos . The torture shown on the video is no accident, but part of a system that is in shame, Ivanishvili said. De Waal said the video is significant, as the prison population quadrupled over the last eight or nine years. ""I do think it (the video) supports the opposition narrative that the government is arrogant and unaccountable, and this is obviously a war of two narratives over Georgia that we're seeing in this election,"" he said. Ivanishvili complained that opposition supporters have been arrested, beaten and had property seized, but nevertheless, ""we still hope we will be able to achieve something close to a democratic election...we hope that the process will be carried out at least close to the democratic fashion."" Still, incidents of violence are possible, he said. Read more: Country profile: Georgia . Georgia experts, too, point to the nation's political volatility because it is so polarized. If such polarization is institutionalized through a vote, it can be healthy, but when it's not it can create a dangerous and unpredictable environment, said Cory Welt, associate director of the Institute for European, Russian and Eurasian Studies at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs. ""We've seen the clash of the titans,"" said de Waal. ""We've seen the clash of two very big figures in Georgian politics, Saakashvili and Ivanishvili, who do not want to share power. They both are claiming total victory, and this, obviously, will have some impact in the U.S., because both sides will be looking to the U.S. and calling on the U.S. to be arbiter, which is rather an unrealistic thing to happen, but I think Washington's going to have to brace itself for those calls.""

"(CNN) -- Since its inception in 1992, the English Premier League has grown into one of football's most compelling and commercially successful domestic competitions. To celebrate two decades of top-level soccer, the finest players and managers to have graced the competition have been honored at this week's ""20 Seasons Awards."" The big winners were Manchester United, the team which dominated the era by collecting 12 championships. United's veteran Welsh midfielder Ryan Giggs was named top player, having featured in every Premier League season and scoring 107 goals. Did Manchester City win the league - or did United lose it? United's legendary Scottish manager Alex Ferguson was also honored, having like Giggs been part of all 12 title triumphs. ""Being named as the best player in the 20 seasons of the Premier League is a tremendous honor for me,"" Giggs, 38, told the league's official website, ""and very humbling when you consider some of the brilliant players who were nominated alongside me."" There was also an award for the Old Trafford team's star striker Wayne Rooney, who received the ""Goal of 20 Seasons"" gong for his stunning overhead kick against archrivals Manchester City in February 2011. United's 4-3 defeat of neighbors City in September 2009, which included a winning goal from striker Michael Owen in stoppage time, was voted the finest Premier League match. But despite United's dominance, Arsenal's championship-winning side of the 2003-04 season took home the Best Team prize. Known as ""The Invincibles,"" the London club is the only team to remain unbeaten throughout an entire Premier League campaign. The full list of award winners feature in the gallery above.

"(CNN) -- In the increasingly globalized world of professional hockey, a plane crash Wednesday in Russia caused loss and grief halfway around the world in North America. All members of the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl team of the Kontinental Hockey League -- including a Canadian coach and some players with extensive National Hockey League experience -- were believed to have been aboard the plane that went down after takeoff from Yaroslavl, about 250 kilometers (160 miles) northeast of Moscow. Authorities say 43 of the 45 people aboard were killed. There were two survivors: one Russian hockey player and a flight attendant. ""Though it occurred thousands of miles away from our home arenas, this tragedy represents a catastrophic loss to the hockey world -- including the NHL family, which lost so many fathers, sons, teammates and friends who at one time excelled in our league,"" NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. ""Our deepest condolences go to the families and loved ones of all who perished."" The news came as the NHL was reeling from the recent deaths of three current or former enforcers, players whose main contribution is to intimidate and fight. The oldest of the three, 35-year-old Wade Belak, was found dead last week in a Toronto apartment. Among those believed to have been on the plane that crashed Wednesday were Brad McCrimmon, a 52-year-old Canadian coach who played in the NHL for 18 years with Boston, Philadelphia, Calgary, Detroit, Hartford and Phoenix. According to the website of the Calgary Flames, former teammates were struggling to come to grips with the loss of McCrimmon, who was on the team when it won its Stanley Cup championship in 1989. ""These things hit you like a ton of bricks,"" former Flames captain Jim Peplinski told the website, referring to McCrimmon by his nickname as a player. ""You do your best to deal with them and move on. Right now, we're talking with our different teammates and trying to come to grips with the reality that 'The Beast' is no longer on this Earth."" Other players on the Lokomotiv roster included former NHL All-Star forward Pavol Demitra, a Slovakian who played 16 seasons for Ottawa, St. Louis, Minnesota, Los Angeles and Vancouver; longtime NHL defenseman Karel Rachunek of the Czech Republic, who played for Ottawa, the New York Rangers and New Jersey; Russian defenseman Ruslan Salei, who played 14 years in the NHL for Anaheim, Florida, Colorado and Detroit; Latvian defenseman Karlis Skrastins, who played 12 NHL seasons for Nashville, Colorado, Florida and Dallas; and Josef Vasicek from the Czech Republic, who played seven seasons for Carolina and the New York Islanders. Demitra scored more than 300 goals in his NHL career and won the Lady Byng Trophy for sportsmanship in 2000. He was the leading scorer at the 2010 Winter Olympics, narrowly missing an open net that would have tied the score in the final seconds of Slovakia's semifinal match against favored Canada, which went on to win the gold medal. Professional hockey has become much more international in the past three decades, with European and Russian players appearing on every NHL roster. The KHL is a major Russia-based professional league that has attracted some NHL players, particularly those of Russian or east European descent, with large salaries and top-flight competition. Though considered a step below the NHL, the KHL also has lured younger players from Europe and Canada who are unable to make NHL rosters right away. That kind of globalization has integrated the hockey world, players say. ""Hockey's such a small community,"" noted Jamie McLennan, a former NHL goalie who once played in Russia, on Canada's TSN Radio 1050. ""It's that six degrees of separation. You can't play with somebody who doesn't know somebody."" While noting that no official fatality list has been announced, McLennan said: ""The names that are being thrown around, you know of them, you played against them, you respect them, you know somebody who was close to them."" Sergei Gonchar, a veteran Russian defenseman for the Ottawa Senators, said he knew some of the players on Lokomotiv ""and it's very hard to hear,"" while longtime Senators forward and captain Daniel Alfredsson of Sweden said the tragedy of the crash was the loss of ""people you know and people you've been around."" McLennan remembered some flights he described as ""hairy"" while playing overseas, and he said different countries have different operating standards for airlines. ""What we're used to may not translate into what other people deem safe,"" he said, adding that ""you expect a certain criteria because that's what you've grown up with."" In Russia, he told TSN Radio 1050, the system seemed ""loose,"" with people sitting wherever they chose despite having assigned seats and baggage brought into the cabin. ""It was just different protocols that I wasn't used to,"" he said.","Several former NHL players are believed to have been killed in the crash .

"Maroua, Cameroon (CNN) -- Flooding in Cameroon's Far North Region has killed nearly 30 people and affected more than 26,000 others, officials said Monday. More than 4,000 people in the Logone and Shari division were displaced, and more than 22,000 people in the region of Maga, Mayo-Danay division, also have been affected. Communication Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary described the flooding as ""a calamity,"" and he called for urgent action to save lives, livestock and property. Dana FM, a local radio station, said the death toll will grow as bodies are collected and identified. For the past few weeks, there has been no sign of the flood easing. The floodwaters have submerged areas like Benoue, Faro, Louti and Mayo. Homes, crops and barns have been destroyed and herds of livestock killed. Heavy rainfall that has lasted nearly a month has fractured the Lagdo Dam, causing the Benoe River to flood nearby villages. Cameroon's government has dispatched a military contingent to the area to help and evacuate victims, and the government of Morocco sent food and other aid Saturday. Aid agencies like Plan International Cameroon and the United Nations Population Fund are concerned about the potential spread of infectious diseases such as cholera and malaria. About 3,000 people have been hospitalized, and tents have been erected to house victims. Demian Toh, a Red Cross official, told CNN that food supplies are running low and the tents are inadequate for the tens of thousands of displaced flood victims. Toh said there were serious concerns about malnutrition among women and children. In 2010, flooding in northern Cameroon triggered an outbreak of cholera that claimed nearly 6,000 lives, according to official estimates. In neighboring Nigeria, dozens of dead bodies have been found floating in remote areas of Adamawa state. Officials there are blaming Cameroon for not alerting them before excess water was released from the Lagdo Dam. The disaster is being called the worst flooding in Cameroon in more than 60 years. Opposition party member Paul Ayah Abine said the casualties and the insufficient aid given to the thousands of victims show clearly that the government has a fragile emergency unit that cannot predict and respond quickly to natural disasters.","Nearly a month of heavy rain has destroyed homes, crops and barns, killed livestock .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The Chinese manufacturer of many of Apple's products has denied allegations that it forced students to work on its assembly lines in a last-minute push to ready the iPhone 5, expected to be unveiled Wednesday. In a statement, Foxconn Technology Group denied it was forcing anyone to work and said the students -- who constitute 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers -- ""are free to leave the internship program at any time."" ""Foxconn has long had a short-term internship program that we carry out in cooperation with a number of vocational schools in China,"" the company said. The internship programs range in length from one to six months and students all are of legal age to work, the company added. An explainer on Foxconn . Foxconn's statement follows claims by a Chinese labor group that many of the students weren't given a choice by their schools whether to work on the assembly line. ""We think that this kind of internship is a sham and a kind of forced labor or involuntary work,"" said Debby Chan, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong-based Students & Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior (SACOM). ""The placement to work must be relevant to studies and the students must find it beneficial."" The group had interviewed students from a vocational school who were required to do internships at Foxconn's Zhengzhou plant even before the students started first year classes, Chan said. The allegations follow a report last week by state-run China Daily that claimed vocational schools in Huai'an in Jiangsu province were making students work at a Foxconn plant making USB data lines for the new iPhone 5. Education, English, food science and finance majors were among those required to do paid assembly line internships. ""I don't think we can improve our skills through that 'internship' the schools are requiring,"" one student told China Daily. Apple has scheduled an event for Wednesday, anticipated to be the release of its latest iPhone. Foxconn is part of Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., one of the world's largest suppliers of components for the electronics industry. Much of its manufacturing division is based in mainland China, where it assembles a range of products including Apple's iPhone and iPad, Amazon's Kindle and Microsoft's Xbox. ""A recent audit of three of our facilities in China carried out by the Fair Labor Association confirmed that there was no evidence to indicate that any of the interns were pressured to participate in or to continue to participate in any internship program,"" Foxconn said in a statement. ""A previous audit by the Fair Labor Association confirmed that students find their participation in this program valuable and that the positions offered by Foxconn were at compensation levels equivalent to entry-level full-time workers."" The Fair Labor Association released a report last month that Foxconn has moved to bring working hours -- including overtime -- down to below 60 hours per week ""with the goal of reaching full compliance with the Chinese legal limit of 40 hours per week, plus an average of 9 hours of overtime per week while protecting worker compensation."" ""Immediate health and safety measures"" had been made, such as enforcement of breaks, changing equipment design to reduce repetitive stress injuries and testing of emergency equipment like eyewashes and sprinklers, the August report said. Foxconn has been at the center of a storm of complaints about working conditions for its Chinese staff after a 2010 spate of worker suicides at its plants. Foxconn said it had increased workers pay, introduced counselors, started a 24-hour phone counseling service and opened a stress room where workers can take out frustration on mannequins with bats. An explosion last year at a Foxconn plant that makes Apple's iPad2 in Chengdu killed four people and injured 18 more. Chinese officials said the blast may have been caused by combustible dust in a polishing workshop. That incident followed a report by SACOM alleging that workers at the same plant do not have adequate training in the use of chemicals and do not have regular on the job health checks. ""While we provide vocational schools with our qualification requirements, it is the schools that recruit the students under the supervision of the relevant local government and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship program,"" Foxconn said on its use of interns. ""In addition to allowing the students to gain relevant industry experience while earning the same industry-competitive compensation as our full-time entry-level workers, this program gives Foxconn an opportunity to identify participants in the internship program who have the potential to be excellent full-time employees should they wish to join our company upon graduation from their vocational school.""

"Moscow (CNN) -- A day after a plane crash outside the Russian city of Yaroslavl killed dozens of Russian and international hockey players, hundreds of residents and supporters gathered Thursday at the arena where the Yaroslavl Lokomotiv hockey club played to commemorate those lost. Russian TV showed mountains of flowers, scarves, flags and other items bearing the team's insignia being laid in front of the stadium in Yaroslavl, a city 155 miles northeast of Moscow. Candles were lit and many people were crying. Churches across the city held memorial services, with many fans attending dressed in Lokomotiv jerseys. Fans put up a poster outside the stadium wishing a speedy recovery for one of the team's leading players, forward Alexander Galimov, who was one of the two survivors of the crash.  Doctors say he suffered burns over 80% of his body.  ""Sasha, keep fighting, the country is with you,"" the poster says, using the Russian nickname for Alexander. Galimov and crew member Alexander Sizov, the other survivor, were flown to Moscow for treatment in leading Moscow trauma clinics, state media reported. The Russian Health and Social Development Ministry earlier described their condition as ""serious."" The Yak-42 passenger airplane was carrying 45 people, including eight crew members, when it crashed just after takeoff outside Yaroslavl Wednesday afternoon. It was bound for Minsk, Belarus, where the team was to play Thursday. Many of those on Lokomotiv Yaroslavl's roster had ties to the National Hockey League -- which includes teams from the United States and Canada -- including Pavol Demitra, a former Minnesota Wild and Vancouver Canucks center from Slovakia, and Josef Vasicek from the Czech Republic, who had played with the New York Islanders and Carolina Hurricanes. Another Lokomotiv player, Ruslan Salei from Belarus, had skated for the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, Colorado Avalanche and the Red Wings. Lokomotiv head coach Brad McCrimmon, a Canadian who also died in the crash, was an NHL veteran as well, the league said on its website. Yaroslavl Gov. Sergei Vakhrukov has declared three days of mourning in the region, Friday through Sunday, for those killed, his website said. The regional authorities have also decided to pay 300,000 rubles (about $10,200) to each family that lost relatives in the incident. The Yaroslavl City Hall, for its part, will pay 150,000 rubles (about $5,100) to each family, and the air carrier will also pay 2 million rubles (about $67,700) to each family, Vakhrukov said at a press briefing in Yaroslavl. The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry reported Thursday that all 43 bodies have now been found at the accident scene, and divers have recovered both the flight data and voice recorders from the plane. ""Investigators are looking into all of the possible theories behind what happened. However, the most likely theories are a technical malfunction or pilot error,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said on its website. More than 50 investigators, criminologists and forensic experts are currently working at the scene, the committee said. Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin said all Yak-42 planes currently in operation would undergo extra checks in the next three days. Speaking from a crisis center set up in Yaroslavl to deal with the crash aftermath, he said that at the moment 16 Russian air carriers are using 57 aircraft of this type. President Dmitry Medvedev visited the crash site and laid flowers there Thursday. ""This was a shock for the whole country,"" he said. ""But there is a special aspect to this: the plane was carrying the lineup of a team loved not only in Yaroslavl but also all over Russia, and which was one of the most successful clubs in this country. ""This is a huge loss not only to all of their relatives and beloved ones but also to all fans and the entire state."" The government will have to take tough measures to upgrade the country's aircraft fleet, step up safety standards and radically cut the number of air companies, Medvedev said. Passengers' lives, not the interests of Russia's aircraft industry, should be the top priority in taking these steps, the president said, speaking at the crisis center in Yaroslavl. Medvedev then went on as planned to the third Yaroslavl political forum, a high-profile annual international event taking place in the city. The Russian president, who delivered a keynote political speech to representatives from 32 countries gathered there, began his address after a moment of silence was held to pay tribute to those killed. The Russian Kontinental Hockey League will now start its regular season Monday, following the commemorative events in Yaroslavl Saturday, the league announced on its website. The chairman of the league's board of directors and a hockey legend in the country, Vyacheslav Fetisov, said on national TV that many players from other hockey teams had said they want to support the club and volunteered to play for the Yaroslav team.  ""We will work on such a transfer mechanism in the near future,"" Fetisov said. And Alexander Medvedev, president of the league, said in a radio interview that ""all the KHL clubs without exception called the league and said they are willing to send their best players to Yaroslavl.""","Tributes are being paid to the members of Lokomotiv Yaroslavl hockey club who died .

"(EW.com) -- Right about now, some intern at Sony is probably carting a few crates of champagne into the boardroom. Or at the very least least a couple buckets of Halloween candy. The studio had a terrific weekend, breaking the September box office slump with the top two hits in the country. ""Hotel Transylvania"" led the way with a tremendous $43 million from 3,349 theaters — the highest September opening weekend of all time ahead of ""Sweet Home Alabama's"" $35.6 million bow a full decade ago. The monster hit, which earned an ""A-"" CinemaScore grade and a sizzling $12,840 per theater average, will continue to play to family audiences in the weeks leading up to the great pumpkin holiday, and will easily break the $100 million mark — a milestone that has evaded main voice actor Adam Sandler's last two films, ""That's My Boy"" ($36.9 million) and ""Jack and Jill"" ($74.2 million). For the still-young Sony Pictures Animation (the animation division entered the marketplace in 2006 with Open Season), ""Hotel Transylvania's"" strong debut is the studio's best opening weekend yet. SPA's former top dog was ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs,"" which started with $30.3 million on its way to $124.9 million total in 2009. ""Hotel Transylvania,"" which cost Sony $85 million, will almost certainly beat that total. DreamWorks and Fox have already proved that there's room in the animation game for studios other than Pixar — especially thanks to the lucrative international market — and it seems Sony is growing into a viable contender as well. ""Hotel Transylvania's"" debut trailed the openings of ""Brave"" ($66.3 million) and ""Madagascar 3"" ($60.3 million) substantially, but it was right in line with ""Ice Age: Continental Drift's"" start ($46.6 million). Still, the animated title wasn't the only reason for Sony to be happy this weekend. The time-bending sci-fi thriller ""Looper"" got off to a strong start as well with $21.2 million from 2,992 locations, immediately setting itself up as a winner for distributor TriStar, a subsidiary of Sony. The Bruce Willis/Joseph Gordon-Levitt vehicle rode a wave of positive reviews over the course of the weekend. After a $6.9 million Friday, the film ticked up an encouraging 28 percent to $8.8 million on Saturday — a sign of positive word-of-mouth, despite the film's mediocre ""B"" CinemaScore grade. For star Joseph Gordon-Levitt, ""Looper"" establishes box-office viability after the terrible performance of his bike messenger film ""Premium Rush,"" which earned only $19.8 million following its August's debut. The film was financed for a slim $35 million by Endgame Entertainment, who partnered with Chinese distributor DMG Entertainment. Working with the Chinese distributor paid off in a big way in China, where ""Looper"" (which portrays a futuristic, dominant China) is expected to earn about $24 million, making this the first time China has ever been the number one territory for a film at the global box office. Times certainly are a changin'. The next three spots on the chart are occupied by last weekend's top three films. ""End of Watch"" fell 39 percent to $8.0 million and has now grossed $26.2 million. ""Trouble with the Curve"" dipped 38 percent to $7.5 million and has now earned $23.7 million. And ""House at the End of the Street"" declined 41 percent to $7.2 million and has now found $22.2 million. 1. Hotel Transylvania -- $43.0 million . 2. Looper -- $21.2 million . 3. End of Watch -- $8.0 million . 4. Trouble with the Curve -- $7.5 million . 5. House at the End of the Street -- $7.2 million . Just outside the Top 5, Universal's buzzy $17 million a cappella comedy ""Pitch Perfect"" proved to be just that. Playing in only 335 theaters, the Glee-ful singing competition flick grossed a tremendous $5.2 million, giving ""Pitch Perfect"" a robust $15,560 per theater average — the strongest of all movies that reported box-office numbers today. Perhaps unsurprisingly, audiences were 74 percent female. Universal will launch the film, which earned an ""A"" CinemaScore, into about 2,800 theaters next weekend. Look for it to hit a box-office high note. Way back in 10th place was Fox's new wide release ""Won't Back Down,"" the teaching drama starring Maggie Gyllenhaal and Viola Davis. The film, which cost a reported $19 million to make, bombed with only $2.7 million from 2,515 theaters, yielding a wretched $1,074 per theater average. Someone please bring those ladies an apple. Two other notes. Summit's ""Perks of Being a Wallflower"" had another great week in limited release. The Logan Lerman/Emma Watson feature grossed $1.1 million from 102 theaters, giving Perks a terrific $11,150 theater average. Summit will continue to expand the film in the next few weeks. Meanwhile ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" set a box-office record overseas, where the film has now earned $693.9 million — the highest international total of all time for an animated film. Meanwhile, the film's $159.6 million domestic cume is a franchise-low for the ""Ice Age"" films. Like I said, times are a changin'.

"Tuvalu (CNN) -- ""Keep calm and carry on"" is a catchphrase that Britain first adopted during World War II -- and while the country may not be at war anymore, it's become a motto as we continue to fight our own personal battles. The Duchess of Cambridge redefined the spirit of the phrase in the past week -- her new motto could easily be: ""Keep calm and carry on with a smile."" You can only imagine what was going through her mind when she stepped out in front of a vast media presence in Kuala Lumpur last Friday, knowing everyone there had seen pictures of her topless, after photos of her on holiday were published overnight in a French magazine. A palace source said she was upset. The irony, of course, was that that day she was dressed as conservatively as she could be, because she was visiting a mosque. I've watched Kate up close for the past year and a half and seen how she conducts herself in public in the context of the frenzy around her; in fact, I am part of it. There is no way I could look that calm and collected knowing that everything I was doing was being scrutinized in such detail. She performs impeccably every time. She never stumbles and always makes it look easy. She copes by being in control. She prepares assiduously for everything she does in public and knows exactly what's expected of her and where her limits are. William and Kate greeted by topless dancers . Make no mistake, the Duchess of Cambridge is smart as a button and a natural public figure. But what I didn't realize was just how steely her character was. She has not just become a member of the royal family -- she's becoming its anchor. William was less able to hide his emotions. At the airport as he left Kuala Lumpur, he had a face like thunder. He was furious with Closer magazine for violating the couple's privacy and humiliating his wife. He had spent the day locked in discussions behind the scenes with a view to suing the magazine, commandeering the original photos and prosecuting the editor and photographer. This was something neither of them was going to take lying down. A red line had been crossed, the palace told me. By the time the couple reached Borneo they had relaxed a bit. Perhaps it was the isolation of the jungle, but William even had time to joke with an approved photographer who was dangling from a tree. William may work with the media, but he hates the paparazzi. This goes back to his childhood, where even at primary school he was overheard moaning about ""'tographers."" It was also the French paparazzi who pursued his mother and surrounded her car as she lay dying following a crash in Paris. Kate's strength is that she doesn't have William's background. She was brought up out of the public eye in the idyllic Berkshire countryside with a stable, happy family. She was only exposed to media intrusion as a grown up, when she was better armed to handle it. British privacy should start with British press . That doesn't mean it's been easy for her.

In Tuvalu, they weren't just coping -- they were separating their public and their private lives, and that's what they want the media to do. William will one day be king and is taking on more and more responsibilities from his grandmother. In Kate, he has found his ""strength and stay"" -- a phrase the Queen used to describe her own husband and rock Prince Philip.

"(CNN) -- The first day of China's autumn holiday came to a snarling halt for motorists. Chinese officials estimate more than 85 million travelers hit the road Sunday, the first day of an eight-day holiday week, according to China's state-run media. Many drivers were trying to take advantage of a new policy that waives the toll on expressways during holidays, according to Xinhua. This could've helped boost road traffic by 13% compared with last year's holiday, reported the news agency. Sunday was the official start of the Mid-Autumn Festival, an eight-day stretch of lunar festivities celebrated with family gatherings, meals and mooncakes, a traditional dessert. Chinese officials estimate there will be 740 million trips throughout the holiday. Fueled by an increase of cars, motorists encountered long delays, as well as traffic accidents, including a collision of a tour bus on the Beijing-Tianjin highway that killed five Germans and one Chinese person Monday morning, as reported by Xinhua. Photos showed stretches of parked cars dotting roadways and motorists standing outside their cars. Trails of cars extended as much as six miles to a toll gate, according to CCTV, the state-owned broadcaster. Motorists told the Chinese television station that they were only able to drive about 18 to 24 miles per hour in traffic. The topic ""held up on the highway"" on Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblogging site, generated over 77 million posts. While stuck in gridlock Sunday, some people got creative by walking their dogs, doing push-ups and playing impromptu games of roadside tennis, according to photos compiled by Tea Leaf Nation, a blog that focuses on China. Li Daokui, the director of the Center for China in the World Economy at the Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management, questioned the wisdom of no tolls on holidays. ""Highway toll free on holidays? We are making a world record of stupidity by launching this policy. To price is a social coordination mechanism and going free of charge is like a shout-out to the public: '1,2,3, let's go jam the road!'"" he posted on weibo. The traffic is not likely to ease around Beijing Monday, as almost all highway exits around the Chinese capital are expected to be jammed until midnight, according to the Beijing News. Congestion has become a common problem in China. In 2010, a traffic jam stretched more than 62 miles on the National Expressway 110, during construction work of another road that ran parallel. Drivers were forced to sit in what turned into a parking lot and fumed over price gouging by nearby food vendors. That traffic jam lasted over a week. But holiday traveling may not be easier on public transportation, reported Xinhua. Authorities are expecting over 75 million rail passengers over the holidays, with most routes already sold out. Photos showed crowded rail stations stuffed with passengers and suitcases lining the platforms.","Chinese roadways were jammed Sunday with 85 million travelers .

"(CNN) -- There isn't just one Republican national convention that started on Tuesday; there are four of them going on. There's the convention for the base, which is why Rick Santorum and Ted Cruz were up there, and why the day was suffused with religion. Then there's the convention for the undecided -- or as they are called now, the persuadables. Anne Romney and Chris Christie were the headliners for this bunch. Mrs. Romney's role was to be the humanizer-in-chief, and the governor's role was to bring his blunt charm to independents looking for a lack of posturing and pandering. As the week progresses, other speakers will be carefully chosen for their ability to get fence-sitters to climb in their direction. Of course, there's also the convention for the media, which in many ways might be the most important audience of all. There are 15,000 journalists in Tampa -- Jeff Jarvis accused them of squandering ""ego-dollars."" Since their coverage will influence a lot more people than actually saw the proceedings, their lens becomes the national lens. Lastly, there's the convention for everyone else. That's most of America, but most of the country doesn't really care that much, which is why ""America's Got Talent"" on NBC pulled in more than 4 million-plus viewers than their convention coverage managed to scrape together. Those are a lot of masters to serve, which is why the first night of the convention came across as such a fragmented affair. There were strands of a narrative -- end the culture of dependency, don't let us turn into Europe, Republican policies help immigrants succeed, you can trust Mitt -- but the strands were stranded, lacking a big cohering theme. What Peggy Noonan said about Anne Romney's speech actually describes the entire evening, that it was ""scattered, full of declarations...that weren't built upon but abandoned."" There were a few moments of strong Republican branding last night; I thought the best single line came from Chris Christie, when he said ""I believe we have become paralyzed by our desire to be loved."" In the era of counting Facebook friends and Twitter follows, that's a message that cuts across parties and that speaks to everyone who in their heart knows and understands the risks of striving for popularity. It's also a smart way to turn President Barack Obama's superior likeability numbers against him, although it's doubtful that Mitt Romney's lower numbers are based on his willingness to trade off short-term favorability ratings for unpopular stances. Chris Christie is building his own political brand around a persona of strident rejection of the seductions of being an object of political eroticism (he is the anti-Clinton in that regard.) But the trouble for the Republicans is that the counterpoint to the ""desire to be loved"" -- what Christie described as ""strengths greater than the passions and emotions of the times"" -- is exactly what many find lacking in his candidate. If political parties are essentially brands -- and they are -- then contemporary political conventions should be occasions when those brands are both strengthened and nuanced. But they rarely are -- the ""bump"" is notoriously ephemeral. There's a reason for that. Successful brands -- those that are both enduring and changing below the surface -- have a strong hand at the controls. Not dozens of self-interested brand managers which their own constituencies, which is the way politics operates. Great brands -- Apple, Nike, Starbucks, Virgin, you name it -- are not created and managed by committees. But that is exactly and literally what the parties are: The Republican National Committee; The Democratic National Committee. The flaws of ""design by committee"" are so well-known that they even have their own Wikipedia page. Parties out of office, by definition, find it harder to create and project a unified, focused brand identity. The lack of a leader, an ability to hand out plum jobs, bitter infighting and posturing for the next election, are all brand-destructive. The 2008 Democratic Party, despite a bitter primary battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, was an exception. Their titanic battle was one of personality more than a debate on the issues, so the core of the party wasn't riven by the fractiousness that comes from being out of power. Obama's singularity and aura of personal mission projected a massively powerful Democratic brand; in fact, it's the emotional investment in the Obama brand that the Republicans are now trying to turn against the president. It's a potent weapon; disillusionment stings. It wasn't the Democratic Party that won in 2008, it was Obama. The personal brand was more potent than the party's. Now we face the reverse. In 2012, the Republicans lack a commanding personal brand at the top of the ticket, and it remains to be seen if their political brand is strong enough to overcome that absence. There's nothing I've seen, from the brand theater of Tampa -- including an inability to cut to anything but older white faces in the crowd -- that looks all that encouraging. There are too many brand managers in the party, and at the party. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Adam Hanft.","Adam Hanft: These are four GOP conventions in one, playing to different groups .
He says the party is aiming at the base, undecideds, the media and everyone else .

"(CNN) -- Marlene Monteolivo was a Democrat for many years, then a Republican. Now she's registered as a nonpartisan voter in Nevada who wants to support a candidate who will make the economy better. The Colombia native, who works for a Las Vegas social services agency, says she's leaning toward GOP challenger Mitt Romney. She likes his business sensibilities. But there's a hiccup. And it's a big one called immigration. It's the 200-pound anchor on the Republican message, say experts in Nevada politics. Many Latino voters will tell you ""It's immigration, stupid,"" in the vein of the famously coined phrase on the economy during Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign. Monteolivo doesn't like that Republicans blocked passage of the Dream Act, which would have created a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. She bristled at Romney's comment that 47% of Americans feel entitled to government aid. She took it to mean that Latinos, many of whom are not well off, are considered freeloaders. Come November, Monteolivo says, her option might be to ""vote for none of the above."" Romney and President Barack Obama are vying for the attention of 268,000 eligible Latino voters in Nevada, a critical bloc in a battleground state that is still reeling from the Great Recession. Nevada leads the nation in the number of foreclosures and in the unemployment rate -- 12.6%. The rate among Hispanics is even worse -- a dismal 14.6%. Add that to Latino disillusion with Obama for failing to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and Romney ought to be able to grab a chunk of Latino voters, says Carlo Maffatt, who works on Latino outreach for the Republican Party. ""With the economy as bad as it is, you would think lot of people would blame Obama and say, 'Let me give Mitt Romney a shot,' "" Maffatt says. But that's not the case. In 2008, Nevada Latinos overwhelmingly voted for Obama, with whose help he handily defeated Arizona Sen. John McCain. Latinos were energized then by the promise of change in America's immigration policies. Four years later, the Dream Act -- designed to create a path to citizenship for some young undocumented immigrants -- is all but dead on Capitol Hill. Obama did sign an executive order that defers deportation for undocumented immigrants who were brought to America as children. But that does not change current immigration law. ""You hear Latino voices saying. 'Obama has not delivered,' "" says David Damore, a University of Las Vegas political scientist. But that disappointment is more likely to translate into a ""let's-just-stay-at-home"" attitude -- as is the case with Monteolivo -- instead of voting GOP, even though Romney has tried to hit home with his message in Nevada. ""I have walked in Nevada neighborhoods blighted by abandoned homes, where people wonder why Barack Obama failed them,"" Romney said in a speech in Las Vegas earlier this year. ""Well, Mr. President, Nevada has had enough of your kind of help."" Tough times might be the reason why Nevada has gone from a strong Obama state in 2008 to a real battleground this time around. But it may not be enough to sway Latinos. That's because many of them -- such as Monteolivo -- cannot get over a widely held perception that the Republican Party's immigration policy boils down to a debate on how high to build the fence along the border, Damore says. The thinking is, he says, is that maybe we should give Romney a chance to fatten our pocketbooks but we can't take the risk with immigration. That perception has not been eased any by Republican candidates in the state. In the nasty 2010 Senate race, Republican Sharron Angle claimed her opponent, veteran Sen. Harry Reid, was too soft on illegal immigration. Latino groups expressed outrage over Angle's ads that they said were racist. They featured ominous images of a border crossing and hostile-looking Latino men; one carried an assault rifle. She also drew ire for proclaiming to Hispanic school children: ""Some of you look a little more Asian to me."" Reid defied anti-incumbent fervor to win a fifth term in office. Post-election pundits agreed that Hispanics, 15% of Nevada's electorate, had stood unified behind Reid to save him. Since then, Nevada's Latino voters have grown in numbers. They have, after all, accounted for nearly half of the overall population growth in the state over the past 10 years. Their voting clout is sure to keep rising, and they form a voting bloc that will keep gaining national significance. That clout is even heavier in an extremely close election year in which the Silver State's six electoral votes are oh so precious. Obama can no longer count on the overwhelming support of Latinos, and Romney has yet to figure out a way to connect, says Eric Herzik of the University of Nevada at Reno. ""The Latino vote may not be wild about Obama, but Romney has not shown them what he can do,"" says Herzik, chairman of his university's political science department. Romney's argument, says Herzik, is that everyone will be better off with lower taxes and less government regulation. ""That's a very nonspecific message,"" Herzik says for Nevadans who are about to lose their home, lose everything. ""Many in Nevada are saying. 'I'm not having a problem paying my taxes. I'm having a problem paying my mortgage.' "" Ana Navarro: To woo Latinos, Romney needs specifics . If the Republicans were able to effectively lay out their economic message, they might have a chance in getting Latinos to overlook what they see as problems in GOP immigration policy, Herzik says. Omar Lopez voted for Obama in 2008 but this year, he is still undecided. Lopez's Las Vegas residential real estate business suffered a great deal in one of the hardest-hit housing markets in the country. He downsized his staff from 12 to 3. He says the president has a competitor worth listening to. In Romney, Lopez sees a successful businessman who can perhaps solve the nation's woes. The problem is he hasn't heard specifics. Last week, he went to hear Romney's son Craig speak at the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors in hopes of hearing a solid economic recovery plan. Part of that, Lopez says, has to be an emphasis on education. ""We are going to crash as a nation if we stop taking away money from education and the economy will be even worse than what it is,"" Lopez says. ""Our kids are not going to college."" Nevada has the highest dropout rate among the 50 states. Only about 60% of Hispanic students in Nevada graduate from high school, according to the state of Nevada. ""I haven't heard a specific plan for education,"" Lopez says. ""How are we going to raise our federal budget to support school programs? How are we going to motivate our teachers?"" Education and the economy are huge issues for Lopez, who is raising a 5-year-old son. But immigration policy is right up there. He achieved the American dream after arriving from Colombia when he was only 21 and understands why immigration is a roadblock between Latinos and the GOP. Maffatt, the GOP outreach worker, blames it partly on what he calls a lackluster effort by the Republicans. Hands down, he admits, the Democrats have done a better job connecting with Latinos. He pointed to Obama's Las Vegas campaign appearance Sunday at the predominantly Hispanic Desert Pines High School. Sharing the stage was Mexican band Mana. Obama might as well have had U2 by his side. Obama's sixth appearance in Nevada this year hit the jackpot with Latino voters, who showed up in droves if not to see him, then the hottest rock stars south of the border. Clever move, says Maffatt, who thinks the Mana concert will help re-energize Democratic Latino voters who might have become disappointed with the president's failure to pass immigration reform. ""Is it the right way to present a candidate? That's debatable,"" Maffatt says. ""But the point is they are doing something. I don't see any (GOP) resources going into Nevada."" Lopez, the real-estate businessman, did not go to hear Mana. He gave his four tickets away to one of his clients. She called him up the next day crying with excitement. ""Oh, God,"" she told him. ""I got to see the president."" It's those small things, Lopez says, that might help Obama with Latinos in Nevada. As for Lopez? He'll be waiting eagerly in front of his television set Wednesday night as Obama and Romney engage in their first debate. CNN iReport: What would you ask the candidates in the first debate? Lopez be tuning in for promises on education, the economy -- and immigration.","Some Latinos in hard-hit Nevada are considering voting for Mitt Romney .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney threw his campaign another curve ball when he revived the sensitive ""birther"" issue while campaigning in his native Michigan on Friday. Speaking before a friendly crowd in the Detroit suburb of Commerce, Romney noted that he and his wife, Ann, were born at nearby hospitals. ""No one's ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know that this is the place that we were born and raised."" he said. The crowd roared at the quip, which was seemingly directed at President Barack Obama, who has faced questions for years from some conservative Republican quarters about his birthplace. Only U.S.-born citizens can be president and Obama released his full birth certificate last year from Hawaii to quiet critics. Romney has said he believes Obama was born in the United States and that the issue was put to rest last year. Although the zinger once again cast Republican candidate away from their key message: that Obama has mismanaged the economy and Romney is the better of the two to get things back on track. Political analysts agree that Romney does much better when he sticks to economic issues and his experience in business, two themes Republicans will stress at next week's nominating convention in Tampa. But this week, Romney and Republicans nationally have been consumed by a political firestorm caused by Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin's explosive comments on rape and pregnancy. Romney spent a good amount of time since they were aired on Sunday in a St. Louis television interview denouncing Akin's remarks and fielding questions about abortion. And now, his campaign is responding to 'birther' questions. A Romney aide that he was only pointing out that Michigan is the state where he was ""born and raised."" Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, author of Leviathan on the Right: How Big-Government Conservatism Brought Down the Republican Revolution, believed it was just Romney being awkward in trying to make a point about his roots. Some found them puzzling. ""I'm somewhat surprised that he would make that joke because he's done a good job confirming that President Obama was the legitimate president of the United States,"" said Andra Gillespie an associate professor of political science at Emory University and author of ""The New Black Politician."" Romney has had a hard time appealing to the right wing of the Republican base, and the comment could, to some, have been a way getting a bump in support -- including financial support -- heading into the convention, said Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies professor at Duke University and the author of several books, including ""New Black Man: Rethinking Black Masculinity."" ""The best way to do that is to play to the crassest elements of the base,"" Neal said. Others felt the comments subtly signaled race. ""The 'birther' issues is only an issue that involves the country's first black president,"" said Fredrick C. Harris, a political science professor and director of Columbia University's Center on African-American Politics and Society. ""And so it raises questions still about the legitimacy about this administration."" And for others, it is a problem of message control when the campaign faces periods of stress. On his overseas trip last month, Romney offended Britons when he questioned the city's readiness to host the Olympics and Palestinians when he credited Israeli culture for its economic success. ""It does speak to a lack of discipline overall,"" Tanner said of Romney's birth certificate comment. ""Look, candidates are going to say dumb things, the president said there were 57 states in the country. God knows what Joe Biden will say on any given day. If you give 100 speeches, you're going to mess something up. But the Romney campaign doesn't seem to respond well to this.""","'No one has ever asked to see my birth certificate,' Romney said in his native Michigan .

"(CNN) -- A second St. Paul, Minnesota, police officer was on leave Friday in the wake of an arrest video that showed an officer kicking a suspect who was lying on the ground. The officer who kicked the suspect, identified by police as Jesse Zilge, had been put on leave earlier in the week. The name of the second officer was not released; police did not specify what role he played in the incident. An investigation continued into the Tuesday arrest of Eric Hightower, who police had been seeking for suspicion of making terroristic threats. The president of the St. Paul Police Federation, the union that represents Zilge, urged people not to rush to judgment. ""Once this process is complete, we believe the facts will show that a good cop was in a dangerous situation with a known dangerous individual,"" Dave Titus said in a statement. ""The video footage captured by an onlooker does not provide complete context of the incident and by no means demonstrates how the officer perceived the threat at hand."" Hightower is already on the ground when the video made by a bystander begins. He can be heard shouting, ""What are you arresting me for?"" In an apparent response to something Zilge said, Hightower then asked, ""Assault on who? Can you tell me what's going on?"" A male voice on the video can be heard saying Hightower had been shot with pepper spray. Several other voices heckle the officer. At one point, Hightower begins to cough and the officer kicks him in the chest once. Zilge then handcuffs Hightower and, with the assistance of another officer, slams the suspect against the hood of a waiting police car. The video, posted on YouTube, is shot from across the street of where the arrest took place was. It is grainy and can be difficult at times to hear what the officer and suspect are saying. At one point, the officer tells onlookers to calm down. ""He beat up a woman last night,"" Zilge said. Hightower responded: ""You lying, man! I ain't even been around here."" The video caught the attention of St. Paul Police Chief Tom Smith, who ""found that the video images raised questions about use of force and immediately ordered a thorough internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding all aspects of the arrest, from start to finish,"" according to police. The two officers are on leave pending the outcome of that investigation. It was not immediately clear whether Zilge had retained an attorney. A listed number for the officer was not in working order. For his part, Hightower is accused of threatening his ex-girlfriend on about August 24-28. Bail was set at $35,000 and, according to CNN affiliate KARE, Hightower bonded out of jail on Thursday. Specifically, he was charged with stalking, making terroristic threats and criminal damage of property. According to the complaint against him, which cites comments from his ex-girlfriend, Hightower strangled and threatened to kill her. KARE spoke to some of Hightower's family members, who gathered outside a courthouse where Hightower made his first appearance Friday. ""Regardless of what he was getting charged with, I don't think the actions were taken appropriately for somebody who's not resisting,"" Hightower's cousin, Antoine Hightower, told the affiliate. A call seeking comment from Hightower's attorney was not immediately returned Friday. CNN's Nigel Walwyn and Calandra Corder contributed to this report.","Amateur video shows Officer Jesse Zilge kicking Eric Hightower in his chest .

"(CNN) -- One week before a potential government shutdown, Senate Democrats for the first time reacted positively to an offer from House Republicans that would keep the government running for two more weeks while cutting $4 billion. ""The plan the Republicans are floating today sounds like a modified version of what Democrats were talking about"" in a proposal made to Republicans Thursday, said Jon Summers, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. However, the Democratic offer Thursday was slightly different in that it was related to a longer-term spending bill that would last until October 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year. For the short-term bill, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told reporters Friday the $4 billion in spending cuts would come from terminating eight programs that President Obama included in his proposed 2012 budget and the elimination of earmarks, the same two areas Senate Democrats said Thursday they were considering. Among other cuts, the Republican plan targets $650 million in highway funds, $200 million in housing funds and $250 million for a reading program at the Department of Education and eliminates a literacy program at that department which the administration labeled ""ineffective."" Republicans said the cuts they are offering are intended to find common ground with Democrats. ""These are things that people have agreed to already,"" stressed House GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy. Democrats have accused Republicans of wanting indiscriminate budget cuts that would hit a wide swath of government programs -- something that wouldn't happen in this latest short-term proposal from the GOP because it is more targeted. ""If they walk away from this offer they are actively engineering a government shutdown, "" House Deputy Whip Peter Roskam told reporters in a conference call Friday. ""We are encouraged to hear that Republicans are abandoning their demands for extreme measures like cuts to border security, cancer research and food safety inspectors and instead moving close to Democrat's position that we should cut government spending in a smart, responsible way,"" said Summers, the Reid's spokesman. The positive reaction from Democrats elicited an equally positive response from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell who said, ""There is now a clear path"" to avoid a government shutdown. House Republican leaders said they are pushing ahead on the short term measure which would allow more time for the House and Senate to negotiate a longer term spending bill for the rest of the year. House Speaker John Boehner said he expects the measure will pass the House early next week, effectively tossing the ball into the Senate's court. ""I'm hopeful Senator Reid will quickly hold a vote on our short-term proposal so we can ensure the government remains open and that we're addressing the need to cut spending,"" Boehner said.","Deal would keep government running for two more weeks while cutting $4 billion .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria's Christians are losing faith that the government will protect them from attacks by Islamic extremists and will ""respond appropriately"" to future killings, the country's leading church group warned Wednesday. In a public message to President Goodluck Jonathan, the Christian Association of Nigeria called the Christmas Day targeting of churches in several cities ""a declaration of war on Christians and Nigeria as an entity."" The group also criticized its Muslim counterparts for failing to condemn the Islamic militants blamed for Sunday's attacks, calling their responses ""unacceptable."" ""The Christian community is fast losing confidence in government's ability to protect our rights to religious liberties and life,"" its president, Pentecostal pastor Ayo Oritsejafor, said in the statement. ""The consensus is that the Christian community nationwide would be left with no other option than to respond appropriately if there are any further attacks on our members, churches and properties."" Nigerian official condemns attacks . Jonathan responded with a statement of condolences for the attacks, which the church group said killed more than 50 worshippers, and a call for Nigerians to unite behind the government's efforts to pursue those responsible. Nigerian authorities have blamed Boko Haram, a fundamentalist Islamic movement that mounted similar attacks the previous Christmas. ""The best thing is for all religious leaders, opinion and traditional leaders, youth leaders and women leaders to come together and assist government,"" Jonathan said. He pledged that his administration ""will surely do more,"" but added, ""The terrorists are human beings. They are not spirits."" ""They live with us. They dine with us,"" he said. ""We know them. People know them. As long as Nigerians are committed to expose them, we will get over this ugly situation."" Nigeria's 150 million people are divided almost evenly between predominantly southern Christians and northern Muslims. Clashes between the two groups have flared periodically for years, but Boko Haram -- which wants to establish a state based on Islamic law in the north -- has stepped up the violence with a series of high-profile attacks in the past two years. The group claimed responsibility for an August car bombing at the building that houses U.N. offices in Abuja, which killed 25 people, and an assault on the town of Damaturu in November that left more than 100 dead. The church group criticized Islamic leaders in the north for what it called their inaction in the face of the attacks, calling it ""unacceptable and an abdication of their responsibilities over their extremist members."" ""It is on record that most religious, traditional and political leaders in the North have not come out openly to condemn the extremist activities of Boko Haram,"" the group said. ""We hold them responsible for what is happening, because they have not taken concrete steps to check the excesses of their members."" There was no immediate response to the statement from Muslim groups. But Jonathan called on leaders of both faiths ""to work together, because terrorism is like a cancer to the body -- it starts from somewhere and spread to all the organs of the body."" Jonathan has led Nigeria since 2010, becoming acting president that May and winning a full term in April. He has deployed government troops across northern Nigeria in an effort to destroy Boko Haram, a step he told the Christian leaders was overdue. ""At the beginning, if the appropriate response was given then over this, they couldn't have developed to this level,"" he said.","Christian leaders say churches are ""fast losing confidence"" in the government .
They say Muslim leaders' responses to the Christmas attacks are ""unacceptable""

"(CNN) -- Cautious American travelers have long avoided travel to North Africa and the Middle East, and the recent attacks on U.S. consulates aren't likely to make the risk-averse reconsider. Yet seasoned travelers say a lack of familiarity with those regions creates generalization and confusion among travelers that could work against tourism to the United States, if the tables were turned. ""I was in Tunisia when ... people were killed at the theater in Colorado, and I was in Tunisia when there was a shootout at the Empire State Building. What people think over there when they hear this, you would think no one would ever come to the United States,"" said Jerry Sorkin, owner of TunisUSA, a tour operator that organizes trips to destinations including Tunisia and Algeria and had recently been weighing resuming tours of Libya, which the company suspended last year. Veterans of travel to tense or unstable areas aren't easily deterred, despite shocking acts of violence like the attack that killed U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. Still, acts of terrorism obviously give many travelers (and their parents) pause. One New York City-based father was trying Wednesday to touch base with his son, who is spending a junior semester abroad in Jordan. ""Jordan is of course much safer and more stable,"" said the father, who declined to be identified out of concern for his son's safety. ""But of course I am concerned and have tried to Skype him (left a message) and will talk to him later. The fact is that life goes on for the vast majority of people in these countries despite the 'big' events."" Pathik ""Tik"" Root won't let the recent attacks alter his plans to travel to Yemen in two weeks for a new job at a start-up news agency. Root was just starting a semester abroad in Damascus, Syria, last year when he stumbled onto what he thinks may have been an anti-government protest in the Old City. He was arrested and held for two weeks in a Syrian prison before being released. U.S. increases embassy security worldwide after Libya attack . ""Attacks like these are meant to change behavior, and if I were to drastically change my plans or my routine it could, in their eyes, justify their use of violence,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""The attacks were intended to be a provocation, but we shouldn't take the bait."" ""Yes I will likely be a bit more cautious about what I do and how I do it in Yemen as a result -- especially on potential flash-point days like 9/11 -- but I'm still going there,"" Root said. Despite the violence and cautions from the State Department and U.S. embassies to Americans living or traveling abroad, Root and other expatriates say they will carry on with their plans in politically volatile parts of the world, taking the precautions they would advise for any American.

The violence in Libya ""certainly will inhibit people from wanting to go to that part of the world and many of them are already inhibited rightly or wrongly, misunderstanding or not misunderstanding, they're already feeling that they should stay away from the region,"" said Sorkin, owner of TunisUSA. The company had been planning to launch a marketing campaign as part of its efforts to resume tours in Libya, but he said that any campaign ""would surely fall on deaf ears"" over the next couple of months. The U.S. State Department issued a travel warning Wednesday against all travel to Libya by U.S. citizens. ""We're constantly feeling the pulse (across the region), not only on a personal level, but constantly with our people on the ground,"" he said. ""Whether it's drivers, guides, lecturers -- we never want to put anyone in harm's way. But generally these regions are very safe."" Daily life not reflected in the news . Raven Smith lives in Mali with her husband and 15-month-old son and pays attention to the political unrest there. ""I can see that the information that is publicized is not reflective of the day-to-day life here,"" she wrote in an e-mail from the capital city of Bamako, where she works on a project strengthening agricultural systems in villages. The situation in Mali doesn't capture the whole picture, Smith said. ""Weddings are still going on, holidays are being celebrated, fields are being tended."" She's not naÃ¯ve, however. ""My plan with my family is that if Bamako seems that it is flaring up, that they will go and spend a few weeks visiting (my husband's) family in Guinea until we see where everything settles,"" she wrote. ""I truly hope it doesn't come to that, but it is never a bad idea to have a backup plan."" Pay attention to cultural mores . Whether you're visiting for a short time or booking an extended stay, pay attention to cultural norms. ""I do try and respect the general cultural norms,"" wrote Smith. ""No showing knees is a big one. Not drinking heavily in public, not inviting men into my house. I'm married now, but even before."" ""I will always stand out, and I have to realize that,"" she wrote. ""But I am also responsible for being a face of America. I am the one who can break stereotypes ... about Americans, and I take that pretty seriously, especially relating to the stereotypes about American women."" What do the locals say? Just as New Yorkers or Los Angelenos might warn you to stay away from particular parts of their beloved cities, residents in other countries might tell you areas to avoid at night or during some events. Pay attention. ""Common sense that is necessary in any foreign country is still enough to get by here,"" wrote Bradley Williams, an undergraduate at the American University in Beirut, via e-mail. ""Beirut is more or less safe despite the occasional burning tires (but) I would exercise caution when going to the Bekaa Valley or the South,"" he wrote. ""Due to the kidnapping, it's not a good idea to go by oneself, for fear of appearing a lone foreign spy, (and it's) not a good idea to travel there at night. However, I think this applies to all people in those areas, not just foreigners."" Get to know people . American-born Chadwick Van Vasa lives in Tunisia in North Africa and is fluent in Arabic, the result of his mother moving to Morocco when he was a child and marrying a Moroccan. Yet he still stands out as a blond-haired, blue-eyed American in the capital city of Tunis, where he lives with his wife and three children and works as a business consultant. His solution? The same notion that keeps people safe in their neighborhoods in Charlotte, Omaha and Seattle: ""I take interest in my neighbors,"" said Van Vasa, speaking on his cell phone from Tunis. ""Our social life and work is very much integrated here. We make meals together. Our kids play together. Because of that, I don't feel threatened. In my day-to-day life, I don't see hostility in my personal interactions with friends."" Look at a map . If you are determined to avoid any part of the world where violence has recently flared, there are still African, Middle Eastern and other countries to visit. Moroccan tourism often suffers when violence escalates in the region. Travel writer Zora O'Neill says she feels perfectly safe right now studying Arabic at a language school in Morocco for an upcoming book. ""Fortunately it's Morocco, which is generally known for being stable, secure and thousands of miles from Libya."" How do you feel about global travel amid anti-American protests?

"Tampa (CNN) -- On the night vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan made his debut on the national stage, the GOP turned its attention to America's influence abroad and what the party sees as President Barack Obama's failed economic policies. The roster of speakers at the Republican National Convention boasted two of the party's foreign policy heavy hitters and rhetoric designed to appeal to voters who are still undecided. Here are five things we learned from the convention's second night: . 1. Romney's enforcer comes to play . On Tuesday, the GOP convention was about love (Ann Romney) and respect (Chris Christie). But to the chagrin of head-scratching Republicans eager to take the fight to President Barack Obama, there wasn't much talk in the Tampa Bay Times Forum about the current administration in Washington. Paul Ryan put those anxieties to rest on Wednesday with a lengthy, aggressive and systematic attack on Obama's record in office, with one question as the thesis: ""Without a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?"" Ryan, criticized by Democrats as the architect of a budget plan that would gut Medicare, went on offense on the issue in the heart of retiree-heavy Florida. ""The greatest threat to Medicare is Obamacare, and we are going to stop it,"" he said. There were also flashes of biography as the Wisconsin congressman tried to introduce himself to a country still learning about Mitt Romney's running mate. But it was clear from his sharpened rhetoric that the Romney campaign sent Ryan onstage to make the case against Obama. He described Obamacare as a cold ""power play,"" condemned Solyndra as ""cronyism at its worst"" and said the president is ""forever shifting blame."" Then there was this line, sure to be remembered for its trenchant appeal to younger voters who had hoped for more from Obama: ""College graduates should not have to live out their 20's in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life."" Responding in a statement, Obama spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said Ryan ""offered Americans 40 minutes of vitriol and a half-dozen previously debunked attacks, but not one tangible idea to move this country forward."" Ryan: White House leadership missing . 2. On weak spots, let surrogates shine . Republicans' nearly singular focus on the economy took a back seat Wednesday when Sen. John McCain and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice took the stage to talk foreign policy, a topic Mitt Romney makes little mention of on the stump and that has been largely absent from the national political debate. Romney faces a solid foreign policy record from the current president, who voters consistently say in polls would better handle America's relationships with other countries if re-elected. In the latest CNN/ORC International survey released earlier this week, President Barack Obama had a 51%-44% advantage over Romney on foreign policy. Facing those facts, the Romney campaign chose Wednesday to use conservatives with well-established foreign policy credentials to make the case that Obama has failed a test of leadership in key international hot spots, including in Syria and Iran. ""Unfortunately, for four years, we've drifted away from our proudest traditions of global leadership, traditions that are truly bipartisan,"" McCain said. ""We've let the challenges we face, both at home and abroad, become harder to solve. We can't afford to stay on that course any longer."" Rice echoed many of the same themes. The former secretary of state said Romney and Ryan ""know that our friends and allies must again be able to trust us,"" what she said was Obama's weakness on the international stage. Yet even Rice turned back to the economy, saying when the world looks at the United States, ""they see an American government that cannot live within its means."" Rice and McCain's remarks were a brief side track to a convention overwhelmingly focused on blaming Obama for the weak economy and how Romney plans to fix it. As Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos noted, neither campaign thinks foreign policy will make a big difference to voters struggling with high unemployment and stagnant wages. ""It's not going to matter at the end,"" Castellanos said. ""Both campaigns, I think, but especially the [Romney] campaign, wants to move on to the economy. And Barack Obama now has the experience, four years as commander-in-chief. So I put that is a plus for the Democrats in the fall."" McCain: Can't have security threatened . 3. Faith does matter . Four years ago, as they were battling for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, Mike Huckabee questioned Romney's Mormon faith. Four years later, as he addressed the Republican convention in prime time, the former Arkansas governor had a very different message. ""I care far less as to where Mitt Romney takes his family to church than I do about where he takes this country,"" said Huckabee, who still wields influence among social conservatives. Some in that key component of the Republican base still harbor suspicions of Romney 's faith. While this convention is supposed to focus mostly on the economy, and while Huckabee did attack Obama over his handling of the issue, he did made the case for why social conservatives need to rally around their party's presidential nominee. ""Let me clear the air about whether guys like me would only support an evangelical. Of the four people on the two tickets, the only self-professed evangelical is Barack Obama, and he supports changing the definition of marriage, believes that human life is disposable and expendable at any time in the womb or even beyond the womb, and tells people of faith that they must bow their knees to the god of government and violate their faith and conscience in order to comply with what he calls health care,"" he said. Republican strategist John Branbender said that social conservatives are extremely committed to beating Obama. ""The important thing Mitt Romney needs to do is moving them from being voters in November to being activists."" ""And the difference is showing and voting and making phone calls, putting bumper stickers on their cars, and frankly that's where a Mike Huckabee, a Rick Santorum, and others, make it so vital, because they're out there on the front lines with social conservatives saying 'the war is now. This is the most important election in our lifetime. We have to win and we have to get active behind Mitt Romney.'"" How faith will matter at the RNC . 4. Condi Rice: A star Is born . Romney advisers gave Condoleezza Rice rave reviews earlier this summer after she addressed a room of Republican donors and GOP officials at a closed-door campaign confab in Park City, Utah. On Wednesday, the country got a glimpse of the political skills and stage presence that may have prompted Romneyland to float Rice as a potential running mate in a buzzed-about leak to the Drudge Report in July. The former secretary of state under George W. Bush and current Stanford professor showed off her foreign policy acumen with a fluent (if somewhat predictable) defense of America's role in the world. ""My fellow Americans, we do not have a choice,"" she said. ""We cannot be reluctant to lead, and one cannot lead from behind. But it was Rice's tribute the American dream, the second half of her speech was laced with nods to her personal story and difficult upbringing in segregated Alabama, that had the convention crowd and political watchers mesmerized. ""America has a way of making the impossible seem inevitable in retrospect,"" she said. ""But of course it has never been inevitable. It has taken leadership, courage and an unwavering faith in our values."" Her speech set Twitter alight. ""Lump in throat,"" said Florida GOP operative Ryan Duffy. ""The birth of a candidate,"" tweeted Roll Call editor David Drucker. ""A memorable speech,"" political analyst Stuart Rothenberg wrote. ""Wow."" Rice: America can't lead from behind . 5. Romney and Ryan don't see iPod to iPod . If you thought that Romney and his running mate are always on the same page, they're not. Ryan highlighted where the GOP ticket splits: on their playlists. The first member of Generation X on a presidential ticket pointed out one of the biggest differences in his vice presidential acceptance speech. ""We're a full generation apart, Gov. Romney and I,"" Ryan said. ""And, in some ways, we're a little different. There are the songs on his iPod, which I've heard on the campaign bus. And on many hotel elevators. He actually urged me to play some of these songs at campaign rallies. I said, I hope it's not a deal-breaker, Mitt, but my playlist starts with AC/DC and ends with Zeppelin,"" said Ryan. Ryan was obviously having some fun, but there's a serious side to his comments. By highlighting their differences over music, Ryan also emphasized his youth. It was accentuated by the 42-year-old congressman's wife and young children joining him on the stage following his speech. And that infusion of youth on a ticket headed by someone in his mid-60s could help. Ryan spoke the word ""generation"" a number of times in his address, at one point saying ""I accept the calling of my generation to give our children the America that was given to us, with opportunity for the young and security for the old, and I know that we are ready."" With national and state polling indicating that Obama holds a large advantage among younger voters over Romney, Ryan can only help. ""We've got our first rock 'n' roll Republican on a national ticket. And that's something Mitt Romney lacked,"" Castellanos said. ""Mitt Romney hadn't made the case yet about taking this campaign into the future. Obama's saying that Mitt Romney wants to go back. Paul Ryan is evidence that this party wants to move forward.""

"(CNN) -- It was a reunion more than four decades in the making. Almost 42 years after Robert Russell' s prized 1967 Austin-Healey sports car was stolen, he has it back, thanks largely to his own detective work. Off and on for years, Russell, who lives in Texas, trolled the Internet looking for his vehicle, which was stolen in 1970 from his home at the time in Philadelphia. He finally struck gold, finding what looked to be his car being sold on eBay and kept at a dealership in East Los Angeles. Viral vigilantism, Tony Hawk style . Russell spoke with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, enlisting its help. All those years later, he still had the car's title that listed its vehicle identification number (VIN), which matched the VIN on eBay. But there was one last catch. The car was not registered in the National Crime Information Center, an electronic clearinghouse of crime data. So over the next few weeks, Russell and Sheriff's Detective Carlos Ortega were in touch with the police in Philadelphia. As it turned out, the car's VIN was incorrectly recorded at the time of the theft. The error was corrected, and Ortgea was able to go to the dealership and confirm the car was, in fact, the one that was stolen. He took possession of the vehicle, which in its current condition is estimated to be worth around $23,000, according to the sheriff's department.

"(CNN) -- Former University of Tennessee women's basketball coach Pat Summitt got some unexpected news just before meeting with the media to discuss her retirement Thursday. President Barack Obama announced that she will be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award handed out by the government. ""I didn't see it coming, but that is a tremendous honor,"" Summitt said. Summitt -- who won more games than any other collegiate coach in any sport -- retired eight months after revealing her diagnosis with early-onset Alzheimer's. Her announcement marked the end of a storied career that began at the university 38 years ago, when she agreed to coach the team for just $250 a month. ""Coach Summitt is an inspiration -- both as the all-time winningest NCAA coach, and as someone who is willing to speak so openly and courageously about her battle with Alzheimer's,"" Obama said. ""Pat's gift has always been her ability to push those around her to new heights, and over the last 38 years, her unique approach has resulted in both unparalleled success on the court and unrivaled loyalty from those who know her and those whose lives she has touched."" Summitt, who led the Lady Vols to eight national championships and whose 1,098 wins are the most in major-college basketball history, will remain involved in mentoring players and recruiting as the team's head coach emeritus. Associate head coach Holly Warlick, an assistant on the team's staff for 27 seasons, has been named Summitt's successor. At Thursday's news conference, Summitt passed her whistle to Warlick. ""No one else has accomplished what Pat Summitt has accomplished in basketball,"" Athletic Director Dave Hart said. ""There will never be another Pat Summitt."" ""I just felt like it was the time to step down,"" Summitt said. ""It's never a good time, but you have to find a time you think is the right time."" She asked students to support the team and new coach Warlick. Under her leadership, Tennessee has been the only school to appear in all 32 NCAA Women's Basketball Tournaments since the tournament's inception in 1982, the university said. The Lady Vols have earned a No. 1 seed in the tournament 21 times. During the 2011-2012 season, Sports Illustrated named Summitt as Sportswoman of the Year, and the NCAA gave her the NCAA President's Gerald R. Ford Award for her leadership in intercollegiate athletics. Summit is ""a legend by any definition,"" said Jimmy G.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United have agreed a deal to sign Arsenal striker Robin Van Persie, the club announced on Wednesday night. ""Manchester United is pleased to announce it has reached agreement with Arsenal Football Club for the transfer of Robin Van Persie,"" said a statement on the club's website. ""The deal is subject to a medical and the agreement of personal terms. A further announcement will be made in due course."" Arsenal's website confirmed that the Dutch striker, who scored 30 goals in 38 games for the London side last season, ""will travel to Manchester on Thursday in order to agree personal terms and complete a medical ahead of a proposed move."" In July, Van Persie stunned Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger with a statement on his personal website that stated his ""goal has been to win trophies with the team"" and attempt to return the club to ""its glory days."" The Dutch striker explained that following a meeting with the Wenger and the Arsenal chairman, Ivan Gazidis, ""it has again become clear to me that we, in many aspects, disagree on the way Arsenal should move forward."" With a year left on his contract, after which Van Persie could move to another club for free, the statement was understood be a public declaration of the striker's intent to leave this summer.

"(CNN) -- The head of Homeland Security travels to Arizona Friday, a day after Mexican authorities questioned two men in a shooting that killed a U.S. Border Patrol agent and wounded another near the U.S.-Mexican border. The Mexican army handed the two over to local authorities in Sonora, having detained them near the American border, the Mexican attorney general's office said Thursday. The two were in possession of drugs and guns when they were detained, added the source. Local authorities are investigating if the pair had anything to do with Tuesday's shooting near Naco, Arizona, where Border Patrol agents came under fire after responding to a sensor that had gone off nearby. U.S. authorities have identified the agent killed as 30-year-old Nicholas Ivie. The Provo, Utah, native, who joined the Border Patrol in January 2008, is survived by his wife and two young children. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and other federal officials will meet with Ivie's family ""to express their condolences,"" said department spokesman Matt Chandler. Ivie is the 14th agent killed in the line of duty since 2008, including three this year. He was killed near a border station recently named for Brian Terry, whose 2010 death led to the public disclosure of the botched Fast and Furious gun-smuggling sting, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. What was 'Fast and Furious'? The agent who was wounded has not been identified. After the shooting, he was airlifted to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. He was released from the hospital Wednesday, said Jeremy Copeland, an agent with the Tucson Sector of U.S. Border Patrol. ""Napolitano (and the others) will also meet with federal, state and local law enforcement officials at the Brian A. Terry Border Patrol Station in Bisbee, Arizona, regarding the ongoing investigation,"" Chandler said in a statement. In addition to Mexican authorities, the FBI is conducting a joint investigation with the Cochise County Sheriff's Office. James Turgal, special agent in charge of the FBI's Phoenix division, has declined to say if the Border Patrol agents involved in the incident returned fire. As of Wednesday, investigators had not found the weapon used in the shooting, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Lanny Breuer, assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, said earlier this week that investigators were at the scene. ""Every time that a law enforcement person is either killed or shot or injured in the line of duty, we have to take a moment and think of our families and think of the heroes involved,"" Breuer said.

"(CNN) -- It is widely agreed that Wednesday night's presidential debate is crucial for Mitt Romney: This is almost assuredly his last chance to turn around the election. What is less obvious is that the stakes are sky-high for Barack Obama, too: This debate could have a powerful impact upon his ability to govern in a second term. Romney is dangerously close to blowing a campaign that many election models said he should easily win. Yes, three national polls published Monday -- including CNN -- showed the two candidates within three points of each other. But for Romney, the problem is that as the polls go up and down each week, there is one constant: As Real Clear Politics demonstrates in its averaging process, Obama stays ahead and has been for nearly a year. The news for the GOP from battleground states is even worse, especially in the Midwest. Unless he wants to depend on a wing and a prayer, Romney is thus in the unenviable position that he has to shake up the dynamics of the race on Wednesday night. Translated, that means he has to score a convincing victory in the eyes of voters. Simply being as good as Obama won't cut it -- a tie goes to the leader. How to watch, clip and share the debate . Can Romney pull off a debate victory? Of course -- umm, theoretically. As he proved in the GOP debates, he is quick on his feet, can throw a punch as well as counterpunch, and he looks presidential -- all assets on television. But his campaign has left him with so much ground to make up that it will be very hard: In the space of 90 minutes, he has to convince voters for the first time that he has a better plan for the economy, make the case that Obama doesn't and prove much more likable than ever before. And all the while, he will have to fend off jabs from Obama, who can draw from a rich trove of Romney mistakes in the past. So, yes, Romney can still win, but it will be darn hard. No wonder he has been practicing so much. It would appear, then, that Obama can simply go for caution, choosing a clinch in the center of the ring over hard punches, and walking away with a tie. But on closer examination, Obama ought to be pressing for a victory, too. Opinion: Debate coach -- Obama, Romney are top performers . In some polls over recent weeks, especially from key states, the president has now opened up a second possible path to re-election. For a long time, his campaign advisers have assumed that he would win but that his margin of victory would be narrow -- less than three points. Even now, his advisers -- even as they are quietly confident about the ultimate outcome -- are running scared, assuming the race will likely close significantly in the final weeks. But it is becoming apparent there is another possibility: Contrary to much conventional wisdom, Obama may actually be able to bust open this race, sweeping almost every state he won four years ago and rolling up a victory margin of perhaps five points or more. Opinion: Ten questions for Obama to answer . The difference between a big win and a small win for Obama is, to draw upon a famous Mark Twain phrase, almost the difference between lightning and a lightning bug. Looking beyond November, what really matters to Obama is whether he can effectively govern in a second term. If he wins big, he can persuasively argue that the American people have spoken loudly and clearly, choosing his path into the future over Romney's. At minimum, he will claim a mandate in favor of higher taxes on the affluent, a strong safety net for those in trouble and a cautious approach toward reducing Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security costs. Republicans will have a much harder time challenging his mandate if he wins big. Moreover, a big Obama victory would keep the Senate safely in Democratic hands and -- less likely -- might put a few House seats in play. Obama campaign advisers have been building a powerful ground game for months; they have far more offices in battleground states than Romney. Their hope is that if they turn out enough voters, a rising tide will lift lots of boats downstream. Especially in the Senate, they entertain hopes that a Democratic candidate can come within three points of Obama. If he were to break beyond 53% in key states, that could elect a lot of Democrats. Add together the possibility of a convincing mandate with congressional results that may be far better than expected a few months ago and what do you have: bingo, a resurgent Obama heading toward a second term. To some of his advisers, that would make it far more likely he could achieve a ""grand bargain"" on deficits, breaking open the deadlock now paralyzing Washington and holding back corporate investment. Opinion: The mistakes candidates make in debates . In short, Obama has a great deal riding on Wednesday's debate, too. Members of his team may talk as if they have less at stake than their opponent, but in their hearts, they know that if Obama can put Romney away in their first debate, he could well have some lightning at his command in a second term. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.","David Gergen: Debate may represent Romney's last big chance to turn around the race .

"London (CNN) -- Rupert Murdoch apologized to the British public with full-page advertisements in seven national newspapers Saturday, a day after two senior executives resigned over a phone hacking scandal that has engulfed his media empire. ""We are sorry,"" Murdoch says in Saturday's ad, which will also run in newspapers Sunday and Monday. ""The News of the World was in the business of holding others to account. It failed when it came to itself. We are sorry for the serious wrongdoing that occurred. We are deeply sorry for the hurt suffered by the individuals affected."" Murdoch's apology comes after his media empire lost two top executives Friday. Former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks resigned from her post as chief executive at News International, the British arm of Murdoch's News Corp., early Friday. Hours later, her predecessor, Les Hinton resigned. Murdoch also visited the family of Milly Dowler, a murdered British teenager whose voice mail was allegedly hacked by staff working for the News of the World. Police in the United Kingdom have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking in documents recovered from a private investigator working for the paper. There were also allegations that News Corp. reporters may have bribed police officers. Murdoch's campaign of contrition comes 12 days after the scandal first broke and barely a week after the News of the World, Britain's best-selling Sunday tabloid, was shut down by News International in the face of public outrage. The advertisement expresses regret for not acting more quickly ""to sort things out,"" but Murdoch acknowledges that apologizing is not enough. ""Our business was founded on the idea that a free and open press should be a positive force in society. We need to live up to this,"" he says. The media mogul pledged to take ""concrete steps"" to resolve issues and make amends. ""You will hear more from us,"" his message concludes. Murdoch, his son, James, and Brooks are to appear before British politicians Tuesday to answer questions over the phone hacking scandal. Some of the claims Brooks faces relate to the News of the World's alleged hacking, while she was editor, into Dowler's mobile phone account. She has warned that her answers may be limited by ongoing police and judicial inquiries. ""As chief executive of the company, I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt, and I want to reiterate how sorry I am for what we now know to have taken place,"" she said in a statement Friday. Hinton, who most recently served as chief executive of Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, wrote to Murdoch to say that although he had been unaware of alleged misconduct when he was executive chairman of News International, which operated the now-defunct News of the World, he had to take responsibility. ""The pain caused to innocent people is unimaginable,"" he said in a letter provided by Dow Jones. British Prime Minister David Cameron has been among those publicly decrying the hacking, blasting Murdoch's company Wednesday as he launched a high-powered judge-led investigation into the nation's press. Yet he has his own ties to the scandal, given his relationship with Andy Coulson. Coulson resigned as News of the World editor in 2007, after his former royal editor and a private detective were convicted of conspiracy to hack into royals' voice mails. But while offering his resignation, he insisted he had been unaware of the crimes and he was not charged at the time. After last year's election, Cameron became prime minister -- and appointed Coulson as his communications director. Coulson resigned as Cameron's spokesman in January when the scandal blew up afresh. Cameron hosted Coulson overnight in March at Chequers, the prime minister's country estate, a Downing Street source said Friday. The aim of the invite, added the source, was to thank his former communications director for his work on Cameron's behalf. Earlier this month, Coulson was arrested in connection with claims of phone hacking and corruption dating to his days as the News of the World editor. After the arrest, the prime minister took full responsibility for hiring Coulson. But while not denying this personal connection, Cameron has maintained public pressure against News Corp. Meanwhile, the FBI is also investigating News Corp. after a report that employees or associates may have tried to hack into phone conversations and voice mail of September 11 survivors, victims and their families. Murdoch's News Corp. encompasses Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers in the United States. News International -- a British subsidiary of News Corp. -- owns the Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain.","Murdoch's full-page ad, run in every national newspaper, says: ""We are sorry""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- America faces an economic calamity. Trouble brews in faraway lands. Superman #14, cover art. Artist: Fred Ray. (c) 1941 DC Comics. All rights reserved. Sound familiar? More than 70 years ago, the very first superheroes debuted in the dire times of the Great Depression and the early years of World War II. Their names became legend -- Superman, Batman (or, as he was then known, the Bat-Man), Wonder Woman, Captain America -- and they're still with us today. A new exhibit at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles celebrates these icons from the Golden Age of Comic Books. Through a collection of rare original artwork and comics, the exhibit explores how a group of mostly Jewish artists created the costumed heroes who came to symbolize the hopes of a beleaguered nation. ""In the 1930s, the American Dream had become a nightmare, and I think comic books and superheroes in particular provided an escapist form of entertainment that allowed the American public to go into a fantasy world where all the ills of the world were righted by these larger-than-life heroes,"" says Erin Clancy, a curator at the Skirball.  Watch a tour of the exhibit » . Guest curator Jerry Robinson not only organized the exhibit, he's a part of it. The comic book pioneer created Batman's arch-enemy, The Joker, and named the caped crusader's sidekick Robin. (Success has many fathers, of course: Bob Kane, credited with creating Batman, has long disputed elements of Robinson's creation stories.) ""We were just emerging from the Depression,"" Robinson recalls. ""Superman started in 1938. Batman started in 1939. So, we were just recovering."" Robinson says the villains changed with the times. ""The first villains in the comic books were hijackers, embezzlers, bank robbers. It was the era of Pretty Boy Floyd and so forth. Once the war came along, we felt a need for more patriotic heroes to fight Hitler. ""In fact,"" he adds, ""Hitler banned American comics, at least Superman and superheroes. He said they were Jewish. Little did he know that the creators were actually Jewish. ... Hitler banned American comics, except one: Mickey Mouse, which was his favorite."" One of the highlights of the collection is Robinson's original sketch for The Joker. ""My first thought was that a villain who had a sense of humor would be different and memorable,"" he says. ""So, I'm thinking of a name for a villain that has a sense of humor. I thought of 'The Joker' as a name, and as soon as I thought that, I associate it with the playing card, as my family had a tradition of champion playing; my brother was a contract champion bridge player. There were always cards around the house. ""So I searched, and luckily it had the typical image of the joker, which came out of a tradition in Europe. This was an important element. Throughout history, we had court jesters, clowns, and so this was an iconic image that was also very useful."" In our own times, the public is turning to costumed heroes again in record numbers. Movies based on comic books are box office leaders; comic books themselves remain a strong and growing industry. ""I think the comic book superhero came out of a context in which the political, social and economic realties were a little tough,"" Clancy says, ""and we can certainly relate to those realities now in our own day. I think the resurgence of popularity of superheroes can be attributed to that."" Last year, audiences made ""The Dark Knight"" the second-highest grossing film of all time. The late Heath Ledger, who won a best supporting actor Oscar for his performance as The Joker in that film, spoke with Robinson before he died. ""I was flattered to hear from him that he based the whole concept of The Joker's persona and rationale on our first concept of The Joker,"" Robinson says. With the box office success of ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Iron Man"" -- plus comic book-inspired films like ""The First Avenger: Captain America,"" ""The Avengers"" and ""Thor"" in development -- it looks like superheroes will continue to inspire. ""I think heroes are back,"" Robinson says. ""I think you can almost chart it. The times are not so good -- we're looking for heroes."" All images and characters copyright DC Comics.

"(CNN) -- The best/worst (take your pick) part of any Olympic Games is the way millions of us end up watching a sport that millions of us wouldn't be caught dead watching under any normal circumstances. I love this stuff. Why, just a little while ago, I found myself reading a story that began: ""Slovenia judoka Urska Zolnir won gold in women's 63 kilogram over China's Xu Lili."" I thought to myself, ""hmmm .... I don't know what a judoka is, I don't know what a kilogram is, and, come to think of it, I can't even tell you where Slovenia is."" And then I think: ""Wait a minute. Didn't you GO to Olympic women's judo once?"" Yes, indeed I did. Barcelona, 1992. I was there when Yael Arad, 25, a 136-pound (not sure how many kilograms that is) aspiring dietitian from Tel Aviv took second place to become the first Israeli athlete (man or woman) to win a medal (gold, silver or bronze) in an Olympic competition (summer or winter). Israel and judo, who knew? They go together like the United States and rugby, like Iraq and ice hockey. I wrote about judo that day, even though I don't know judo from jiu-jitsu from karate from taekwondo. I only know that you sign up your grandson for lessons, and he goes to a class at a mall. The women in Barcelona came out in what looked like white bathrobes. I saw one's belt come loose. Was that a point for her opponent? I saw one go down. ""That's an ippon,'' I was told by the guy next to me. I saw a point go on the scoreboard under the word ""koka."" It was my first time seeing an ippon go up on a koka. I was enjoying my first judo. I wasn't yet ready for the National Judo League to put Monday Night Judo on TV, but I was having a good time. The women grunted and groaned on the mat and appeared to be having a really bad-ass game of Twister. It got pretty physical out there. Not quite Batman vs. Bane, but definitely tough stuff. I got a kick out of watching them fight. I looked up that day's judo results later on a computer and found the following: 19 ippons, 13 waza-aris, 22 yukos, 35 kokas, 13 shidos, three chuis, two keikokus and no hansoku-makes. Don't you hate it when you watch judo all day without seeing a single hansoku-make? Sports of all sorts, that's the Olympics in a nutshell. I think they've had every kind of sport so far -- SO FAR -- except bungee jumping, elephant hunting and ""Celebrity Apprentice."" The 1896 Athens Games began with King George I of Greece declaring them open. He did not jump out of a helicopter first with James Bond. He did not need to listen to the ""Chariots of Fire"" theme. He did not sit at home watching Bob Costas on TV, although Zeus knows that he probably did know a whole lot of guys named Costas. Swimming was part of those 1896 Games. I doubt if any Speedo suits were involved. Do you know where the 1896 swim events were held? In the bay. I ain't kidding. They swam in the Bay of Zea, not in some cool pool. I bet the bronze medalist would be really angry if he lost a few seconds on the clock while attempting to swim for his life from a shark. The 1900 Paris Games included cricket and croquet. It also had golf, which is being brought back for 2016. I am extremely excited about this, because whenever I think of an Olympic athlete, I think of a lean, hard, buff, rock-abbed, Adonis-like individual like Phil Mickelson. Paris also had a sport called Basque Pelota. I personally love pelota, but not that Basque kind. In the first place, I believe it uses a designated hitter. In the second place, Basque Pelota is notorious for its MVPs being on steroids. I am glad Basque Pelota is gone now. Otherwise, NBC would probably ask Savannah Guthrie to get out there and try to play it. The 1904 St. Louis Games had sports I could comprehend. Like tug of war, for one. Nobody needs to explain tug of war to me. One team tugs. The other team tugs. Whichever team tugs harder wins. I do not know if the losing team fell face first into Missouri mud, but I'd like to think so. (By the way, although Boston and New York usually get most of the publicity, St. Louis fans are considered by many to be the greatest tug-of-war fans in the world.) Those 1904 Olympics also had a sport called roque, which is a form of croquet. It hasn't returned since, so maybe there was a scandal. Maybe the winner got caught corking his mallet. I wish croquet would make a comeback in the Olympics, particularly so the top croquet stars could end up with at least 500,000 followers on Twitter. I can see Canada becoming very good at this. The croquet fights alone would go over big in Toronto. Nowadays, we have things such as archery, badminton, beach volleyball, canoe slalom, equestrian, handball, modern pentathlon and water polo that you don't usually see on TV. I mean, let's face it, there aren't a lot of archery highlights shown at 11 o'clock. Not a lot of ""Top 10 Shuttlecock Shots of the Day."" Not much canoe coverage for all you whitewater fantasy-league geeks. I have been to 11 Olympics in person, yet I still have no clue what modern pentathlon is, or if there was ever old-fashioned pentathlon. The only archery I have witnessed between 2008 and 2012 was in ""The Hunger Games."" I am one of those old dudes who can't take synchronized swimming (or diving) seriously because all I can see is Harry Shearer doing it with Martin Short. I just watched equestrian events on TV. I pull for the horses. I want a horse to get up on a pedestal and get a gold medal. I think the horse does the hard part and deserves the perks. I see some poor gelding about to leap over an obstacle, and I bet he's thinking to himself: ""I could jump even higher if I could get this fool off my back."" Greco-Roman wrestling is another sport you can go four years without watching once on TV. I know there are networks that could use a hit, so they really should consider Greco-Roman wrestling with masks and costumes and 250-pound men jumping off the top rope. It is so cool seeing some of these obscure Olympic sports come back to life. I believe the popularity of some of these sports could rise dramatically if shown more frequently on TV. Bikini beach volleyball should be shown 23 hours a day. If I worked for NBC, for example, I would be absolutely begging the International Olympic Committee to give serious consideration to bikini judo. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Downey.","Mike Downey: Olympics compel us to watch sports we'd never follow .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez will appeal to voters Sunday with his track record on education, housing, health and living standards the past 13 years -- with an admission he needs to do more on bureaucracy and crime. His opponent, Henrique Capriles Radonski, also is advancing social programs, but as the candidate of an opposition coalition, he is urging a new path that he says would promote government efficiency and fix problems in the country's infrastructure. The two men are offering competing visions for the oil-rich country in this weekend's presidential election. Venezuela is the fourth-largest exporter of oil to the United States, though the two countries have often been at odds under Chavez' presidency. Chavez is a charismatic standard-bearer of the Latin American left, but the ebullient leader is 58 years old and has been visibly weakened by two surgeries for cancer. He has kept secret his kind of cancer and prognosis. Capriles is a fast-rising conservative who was a mayor, a parliament member and governor of Miranda, which adjoins the nation's capital. The 40-year-old attorney-turned-politician is so active on the campaign trial that he's nicknamed the ""roadrunner."" His skinny stature is yet another contrast to Chavez, who's of beefy build. Capriles is posturing as a moderate who favors some of Chavez's programs, such as his social ""missions"" -- which could prove problematic with the coalition of conservative parties backing his candidacy, analysts say. ""This is the most united that the opposition has been"" against Chavez, said Miguel Tinker Salas, a Latin American history professor at Pomona College in California and author of ""The Enduring Legacy: Oil, Culture and Citizenship in Venezuela."" Capriles' Justice First party has adhered to a conservative, neo-liberal economic policy, but his ""First 100 Days of Progress"" plan emphasizes ""political reconciliation"" in which he would help workers in state enterprises and missions and maintain unions as ""a force."" Capriles is facing ""a Venezuela that has now been transformed in the last 14 years, and he faces a significant challenge to reinvent himself and not sound like a chameleon,"" Tinker Salas said. ""He hopes that the people of Venezuela have a certain degree of amnesia"" about his conservatism, Tinker Salas added. Capriles said he would root out corruption in the Chavez administration, and he says that that Venezuela's crime rate has made people fearful of leaving their homes. His plan for progress would improve public safety, maternal care, housing, education, and health programs. Like Chavez, he is appealing to struggling families. Almost one in fourth births in Venezuela is by mothers who are under age 19, Capriles says. At the same time, Capriles would decentralize and reform government and make public service delivery more efficient. ""He's not saying that Chavez is bad, but because of his very authoritarian style of government, programs have not been creating results, and that's why people are frustrated and he's tapping into that,"" said Michael Shifter, president of Inter-American Dialogue. Capriles would continue Chavez's social agenda -- but with more results, Shifter said. Government hiring would be based on expertise, not political loyalties, for example. ""To his credit, he's showing a sense of realism in the campaign, and he's not promising dramatic changes from one day to the next, and he know it's going to take time,"" Shifter said. For his part, Chavez has pledged he would keep the economy growing, said Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Despite a recession a few years ago, the Venezuelan economy has expanded the past two and a half years, Weisbrot said. Unemployment has been halved since Chavez took office 1999, down to the 7% range, he added. Chavez would continue to reduce extreme poverty -- which now stands at 7% -- through payments to households with children and boosting living standards. His administration has recently built 250,000 homes for families -- which, based on national population, would be equivalent to 2.5 million new homes in the United States, Weisbrot said. ""Since the Chavez government got control over the national oil industry, poverty has been cut by half and extreme poverty by 70 percent. College enrollment has more than doubled, millions of people have access to health care for the first time, and the number of people eligible for public pensions has quadrupled,"" Weisbrot wrote in a recent analysis. Added Shifter about Chavez: ""He's running on what he has accomplished, much like Barack Obama."" ""But there is still a gap between the rich and the poor, and those are contradictions that Chavez has to address,"" Shifter said. There's other room for improvement, Chavez has indicated. ""His big promises are where he recognizes that the government has failed, and it needs more efficiency in public works, infrastructure and governing,"" Weisbrot said. One apparent sign of infrastructure woes occurred in August when an oil refinery explosion killed 42 people. That plant suffered mismanagement, delays in major maintenance and underinvestment, according to analysts and an engineering firm's recent report. The state-run oil company that operates the refinery was found to have been hampered by how Chavez uses the refineries as ""a cash cow"" to fund social programs such as building homes for low-income voters, the report said. The fires at the Amuay refinery also were described as ""the most lethal industry accident in Venezuela to date"" by analysts. The government's refinery manager also said the explosion wasn't due to a lack of maintenance, according to government television. Chavez said that such accusations were ""irresponsible"" because investigators were still trying to determine the cause of the accident. What gives Venezuela global importance is its 500 billion barrels in oil reserves. That compares to its total production and exports of 1 billion barrels a year, Weisbrot said. That means Venezuela is going to be around for a long time -- with Chavez possibly at the helm, experts say. ""The United States is just going to have to get used to it,"" Weisbrot said. ""They've been wrong about this guy just like they've been wrong about Cuba for the past 50 years. ""Look at all of the leftist governments that have been elected: Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Ecuador, Bolivia and all of them have been re-elected and some of them twice. ""That's what happens when you deliver on your promises,"" Weisbrot said.","Hugo Chavez is running on his 13-year record as Venezuela's president .
But Chavez is acknowledging that there's room for improvement, analysts say .
Henrique Capriles is the opposition candidate who also favors a social agenda .
Capriles is also seeking government efficiencies and infrastructure improvements ."
"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A Pennsylvania judge ruled Tuesday that state officials cannot enforce a new voter identification law in next month's presidential election. The ruling by Commonwealth Court Judge Robert Simpson is expected to be appealed, but amounted to good news for Democrats who contend the voter ID law is motivated by Republican efforts to suppress the traditionally Democratic minority vote. ""It's a huge victory in that the photo ID requirement for the November election has been blocked and people without ID will be able to vote on regular ballots,"" said Witold ""Vic"" Walczak, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union in Pennsylvania. Read the documents (.PDF) Supporters argue that the law signed in March by Republican Gov. Tom Corbett will prevent voter fraud and is upheld by the Constitution. ""Today's ruling is a temporary setback,"" said Horace Cooper, director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Voter Identification Task Force. ""Notably, the court's ruling accepts the principle that the voter ID rules are legal. Unfortunately, the timing of the change meant that Pennsylvanians will have to wait one more election cycle before they can be sure their elections are fraud-free,"" Cooper said. In his ruling, Simpson granted a preliminary injunction that temporarily halts enforcement of the law until after the November 6 election. He cited likely disqualification of eligible voters as the reason. ""Consequently, I am not still convinced in my predictive judgment that there will be no voter disenfranchisement arising out of the commonwealth's implementation of a voter identification requirement for purposes of the upcoming election,"" Simpson wrote. ""Under these circumstances, I am obliged to enter a preliminary injunction."" Sisters navigate new Pennsylvania voter ID law . However, Simpson's ruling allows other provisions of the law to stand, including voter education efforts that a photo ID is required to cast a ballot. Election officials also can ask for photo identification, but cannot prevent people from voting if they don't have it. The judge wrote that state legislators intended for election officials to request a photo ID during the transition period for the new law ""even though the vote will be counted regardless of compliance with the request."" ""The concern is that the Commonwealth's education efforts all tell people that they need ID and if that kind of misleading message goes out, it will promote confusion on Election Day and discourage folks without ID from voting,"" said Walczak. Simpson's ruling means the full voter ID law could be enforced starting next year. His ruling said he will schedule a further hearing on whether to issue a permanent injunction. Prior to the new law, first-time voters in Pennsylvania were allowed to present documents like bank statements and utility bills in lieu of photo identification. Under the new law, all voters would have to present a valid photo ID -- one that is sanctioned by the state -- before they cast their ballots. To get a photo ID, residents must have a valid Social Security card; an official birth certificate or U.S. citizenship documents; and two proofs of residency, such as a utility bill or tax records. New voting measures could deter Latinos, civil rights group says . Polls show President Barack Obama leading Republican challenger Mitt Romney in Pennsylvania, which has 20 electoral votes. Critics say the new law is an attempt by Republicans -- who overwhelmingly support the measure -- to gain the advantage in a close election. Corbett said the law ""sets a simple and clear standard to protect the integrity of our elections."" However, lawyers on both sides admit there are no known cases of in-person voter fraud. Civil rights organizations and attorneys filed a lawsuit in May to overturn the new law. The case made its way to the state Supreme Court, which sent the dispute back to Simpson in the Commonwealth Court. Justice Department OKs New Hampshire voter ID law . Pennsylvania is one of 31 states with some form of voter ID measure in place. Most have provisional voting mechanisms for people lacking the proper identification at the polling place. Four of the states -- Georgia, Kansas, Tennessee and Indiana -- require a photo ID to cast a regular ballot. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Indiana's law in 2008. Five other states, including Pennsylvania, have passed photo identification laws that now are under review or legal challenge, while seven states have less restrictive photo ID laws. CNN's Tom Cohen, Bill Mears, David Ariosto, Sarah Hoye and Deb Feyerick contributed to this report .","NEW: Several states have laws requiring photo IDs to vote .

"Washington (CNN) -- More than a dozen Justice Department and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives officials faced punishment Wednesday after a long-awaited report on the botched gun probe known as ""Operation Fast and Furious."" That probe and a previous investigation were marked by ""a series of misguided strategies, tactics, errors in judgment and management failures"" that allowed hundreds of weapons to reach Mexican drug cartels, the Justice Department's independent inspector general concluded. Within minutes of the report's release, Justice announced rthat former acting ATF chief Kenneth Melson was retiring and another official, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein, had resigned. Read excerpts from the report . Weinstein and Melson were among 14 people who ""bore a share of responsibility for ATF's knowing failure in both these operations to interdict firearms illegally destined for Mexico, and for doing so without adequately taking into account the danger to public safety that flowed from this risky strategy,"" the report states. Weinstein failed to pass along key information about the flawed tactics being used in Fast and Furious, while Melson and other ATF officials didn't properly supervise the probe, the report states. The report referred them and another 12 officials in Washington and the ATF and U.S. attorney's offices in Phoenix to Justice officials to determine ""whether discipline or other administrative action"" was required. Holder reacts to report . ""Fast and Furious"" became public after guns traced to the probe turned up at the scene of a Border Patrol agent's December 2010 killing. The resulting investigations discovered similar tactics in a 2006-2007 operation dubbed ""Wide Receiver,"" also run out of Phoenix. Revelations that ATF agents watched suspected gun traffickers cross into Mexico with weapons purchased at U.S. gun shops outraged lawmakers. Larry Alt, one of the ATF agents who blew the whistle on the operation, told CNN that it was ""egregious"" that agents were watching people transfer guns to people who were handing them over to the cartels, ""and we were not taking an enforcement action."" ""I would say that the persons responsible for this case ... at the field level, the division level, and the headquarters level and as far as it went into the Department of Justice, should be held accountable for any decision that they made that allowed these guns to go out on the street unmonitored,"" Alt said. Making matters worse, the Justice Department initially denied guns were being allowed to ""walk"" across the border, only to have to formally retract that statement in December 2011. The controversy forced Melson out at ATF, but he remained in another post at Justice until Wednesday. Acting ATF Director B. Todd Jones, meanwhile, said his agency ""accepts full responsibility"" for failing to oversee the Arizona probes. What was 'Fast and Furious,' and what went wrong? ""This hurts. This hurts people here,"" Jones told reporters. But he added that the ATF has been tightening up its procedures and won't shy away from tough operations. ""All we can do is get off the mat again and keep swinging,"" he said. The controversy fueled Republican accusations of a cover-up by the Obama administration and led to an unprecedented vote to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress. The report found that Holder was not informed of the controversial ATF operation until 2011, after Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed. In a written statement on the findings, Holder said the inspector-general's report upholds ""what I, and other Justice Department officials, have said for many months now"" -- that the tactics used pre-dated the Obama administration and that Justice Department leaders didn't try to hide the facts from lawmakers. ""It is unfortunate that some were so quick to make baseless accusations before they possessed the facts about these operations -- accusations that turned out to be without foundation and that have caused a great deal of unnecessary harm and confusion,"" Holder said. ""I hope today's report acts as a reminder of the dangers of adopting as fact unsubstantiated conclusions before an investigation of the circumstances is completed."" The truth about the Fast and Furious scandal . But Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who brought ATF whistleblower complaints to the department's attention in early 2011, said the report ""reaffirms virtually everything"" that congressional investigators turned up. ""It's clear that both the ATF and the Justice Department failed to provide meaningful oversight of Operation Fast and Furious,"" Grassley said in a written statement. Those agencies ""ignored warnings from employees"" and refused to acknowledge how bad the problem was until after months of congressional pressure, he said. And Grassley said the report inaccurately lets Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer ""off the hook"" regarding a February 2011 letter to Congress that denied guns were being allowed to cross the border. Along with the statement, Grassley released e-mails he said contradict the report. Breuer acknowledged last November he had learned that guns were allowed to ""walk"" to Mexico, and apologized for not informing other senior Justice Department officials. The February 2011 letter to Grassley was later retracted by Justice officials. Wednesday's report criticized Breuer and another top official, Gary Grindler, who was acting deputy attorney general when the events took place, for failing to pass along information to the attorney general and other top officials. But they remain with the department. A standoff over internal Justice documents erupted after the Obama administration said it was asserting executive privilege in the Fast and Furious case to shield documents that include internal deliberations traditionally protected from outside eyes. That prompted the House of Representatives to vote a civil contempt charge against Holder -- the first time a Justice Department chief has been held in contempt by Congress. Democrats protested the vote vehemently as being purely political, and the citation passed along party lines. The House took the issue to court, where it is expected to linger until well beyond November's presidential election. By the numbers: Fast and Furious . Some of the documents the White House withheld under the privilege claim were included in the report. Grassley said that inclusion ""proves that this subset of documents could have been released earlier,"" and the president ""was merely thumbing his nose at Congress"" before the contempt vote. Rep. Darrell Issa, who pushed for the contempt vote against Holder as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee, the report shows ""widespread failures"" and ""a near-total disregard for public safety."" ""Attorney General Holder has clearly known about these unacceptable failures, yet has failed to take appropriate action for over a year and a half,"" added Issa, R-California. Holder had said he was awaiting the report to determine what actions to take against individuals involved in the case. But he has promised Congress that such ""gun walking"" of weapons into Mexico would never again be allowed. Issa called on President Barack Obama to ""step up and provide accountability"" for the program. And Inspector General Michael Horowitz, whose office produced the report, is scheduled to appear before Issa's committee on Thursday. Tell us what you think: Share you reactions to the report.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Abu Laith al-Libi, a wanted al Qaeda terrorist, was killed in Pakistan by a CIA airstrike, three U.S. officials told CNN Thursday. Abu Laith al-Libi in April 2007 during a videotaped interview by al Qaeda's media wing. Al-Libi was described as a senior al Qaeda leader believed to have plotted and executed attacks against U.S. and coalition forces, including a February 2007 bombing at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan during a visit by Vice President Dick Cheney. He was on a ""most wanted"" list of 12 accused terrorists which was issued in October by the Combined Joint Task Force-82 -- an anti-terror unit in Afghanistan. Earlier, a knowledgeable Western official and a military source confirmed al-Libi's death to CNN. The same official said al-Libi is ""not far below the importance of the top two al Qaeda leaders"" -- Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. The officials said al-Libi was killed by a missile from an airplane. Radical Islamist Web sites announced al-Libi's death. ""May God have mercy on Sheikh Abu Laith al-Libi and accept him with his brothers, with the martyrs,"" said a eulogy posted on a main Islamist site, Al-Ekhlaas. Al-Libi, 41, was of Libyan descent and was believed to have been in the Afghanistan/Pakistan border region, according to the U.S. military. A U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN he was a significant, senior al Qaeda figure who had taken on a more prominent role in the organization in recent years. This official also confirmed that al-Libi was responsible for plotting attacks targeting U.S. and coalition forces as well as Afghan officials.  Watch senior Arab affairs editor Octavia Nasr detail al-Libi's significance » . In an earlier role, he was a leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which eventually merged with al Qaeda, the counterterrorism official said, and was responsible for planning attacks throughout North Africa and the Middle East. The official described al-Libi as part of al Qaeda's inner circle, who helped fill the void created by the capture or death of other senior people in the organization. A U.S. military official with Combined Joint Task Force-82 said they have no information on al-Libi's death. But he added that CJTF-82 does not collect information from outside of Afghanistan, and would be informed of targeted operations only ""if the Pakistani military share(s) that with us."" The Pakistani military said an explosion occurred in North Waziristan on Tuesday, and 12 people were killed. However, it was unclear whether this was the incident in which al-Libi was killed. Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN it was not clear who attacked whom and that he could not comment on the identities of the dead since local al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates removed the bodies and buried them. The U.S. military placed al-Libi on its most wanted list in 2006, behind bin Laden, al-Zawahiri and Taliban leader Mullah Omar. In October, they announced rewards ranging from $20,000 to $200,000 for al-Libi and 11 other mid-level Taliban and al Qaeda leaders. At that time, the military distributed posters and billboards with pictures and names of the insurgents around eastern Afghanistan. Al-Libi and the others were described at the time by CJTF-82 spokesman Maj. Chris Belcher as ""mid-level bad guys."" He appeared in a 2002 audio recording posted on an Islamist Web site, saying al Qaeda had regrouped and intended to expand its war to include assassinations and attacks against infrastructure. He also appeared in a 2004 video that showed him participating in an attack on an Afghan army base. Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, the top Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a statement saying al-Libi's reported death would be ""a positive development"" in efforts against terrorism. ""Intelligence points to, and his [al-Libi's] increasing role in al Qaeda propaganda suggests, that he would have been a top field commander and planner for al Qaeda,"" Hoekstra said. ""His death, if confirmed, clearly will have an impact on the radical jihadist movement."" He said that through the committee, he would monitor the effects on al Qaeda operations.

"(CNN) -- Lance Armstrong, seven-time winner of the Tour de France, on Thursday announced he would no longer contest charges that he doped his way to victory. The 40-year-old legendary cyclist still maintains he's innocent. Here are five key questions and answers to help you better understand the complicated development in a longstanding controversy involving one of the most achieving endurance athletes of all time: . 1. What has Armstrong been accused of and what does he say? The United States Anti-Doping Agency charged Armstrong with doping and trafficking of performance-enhancing drugs. Several members of Armstrong's former team also were charged. Armstrong vehemently maintains that he has never doped and that he has never failed a drug test. He accused the USADA of pursuing an ""unconstitutional witch hunt"" against him and he maintained the USADA does not have the right to prosecute him. On Monday, a U.S. Federal Court ruled against the cyclist. The cyclist explained Thursday that he would no longer fight the charges, saying that the ongoing battle had taken a toll on him personally and on his family. Read Armstrong's statement in full on his site. 2. What does Armstrong's decision not to contest USADA's charges mean? The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency is the body responsible for monitoring drug testing for U.S. Olympic and Paralympic sports for athletes in and out of active competition. USADA says Armstrong's decision not to contest the charges means there will be no hearing on the actual charges and as a result he will receive ""a lifetime period of ineligibility and disqualification of all competitive results from August 1, 1998, through the present."" What's behind the Armstrong headlines? 3. What about Armstrong's record seven Tour de France titles? Right now it's unclear what this will mean for the seven wins. USADA says that Armstrong will be ""disqualified from any and all competitive results obtained"" since August 1, 1998. USADA says that Armstrong will be stripped of seven Tour titles, all of his other titles and the bronze medal he won at the 2000 Olympics. Travis Tygart, USADA's CEO, told the New York Times that it also means that Armstrong cannot coach or have any ""official role"" with any Olympic sport or other sport that adheres to the World Anti-Doping Code. However, the International Cycling Union, based in Switzerland, the world governing body for cycling, said Friday that it will not act until it hears directly from USADA, suggesting it wants to see more details on the case. It's unclear if USADA has the power to ""strip"" Armstrong of his Tour de France titles or if that jurisdiction lies with the UCI. Officials with the Tour de France are waiting before they comment on Armstrong's case, the Washington Post reports. On his site, Armstrong wrote: USADA cannot assert control of a professional international sport and attempt to strip my seven Tour de France titles. I know who won those seven Tours, my teammates know who won those seven Tours, and everyone I competed against knows who won those seven Tours. Cyclists say 'good riddance' to Armstrong . 4. Where does this leave the sport of cycling? There have been numerous other allegations of doping against cyclists. The Internet magazine Slate recently examined how many cyclists dope compared with other athletes. Tour de France winners Floyd Landis and Alberto Contador were involved in doping cases and had their Tour titles taken. Landis accused Armstrong of doping, prompting Armstrong to fire back that Landis was a liar and had no credibility. Just last month, a French Tour de France cyclist was suspended while an investigation into doping could take place. In Armstrong's case, USADA said it had numerous witnesses ready to testify at a hearing that Armstrong had indeed doped. Those witnesses include some of his teammates, such as Tyler Hamilton and George Hincapie, legends in cycling. Hamilton told CBS's ""60 Minutes"" in May that he helped Armstrong dope. Hamilton's credibility has been questioned because he himself doped, and has been stripped of a 2004 Olympic time trial gold medal. 5. What does this mean for Armstrong's legacy? Armstrong is famous for his work on behalf of cancer research under his Livestrong Foundation which he says has raised $500 million. The foundation will turn 15 in October. An online petition has popped up to rally for Armstrong. Nike, which has a contract with Armstrong, announced Friday that it will stand behind the athlete. Anheuser-Busch also said it's supporting the pitchman of its Michelob-Ultra brew. Though many others feel that fans who believe he did dope shouldn't forgive him. Armstrong's cancer foundation still strong . Only time will tell whether Armstrong will remembered for all the good he has done or whether, as some believe, he cheated his way to victory. ESPN's Darren Rovell contemplated how tough it will be for many to decide what they think of Armstrong. Rovell retweeted a picture of one angry fan's take on Livestrong's iconic yellow bracelet.","In question is whether USADA can strip Armstrong of his 7 Tour de France titles .

"Lahore, Pakistan (CNN) -- Police officer Muhammad Azad spends an hour a day running laps because he is running out of time. If he doesn't trim two inches off his 42-inch waist soon, the police department in the northern Pakistani state of Punjab could demote or even fire him. That's something Azad can't afford because his $210 monthly salary is the only way he provides for his wife and two children. ""I'm trying to lose as much weight as possible,"" a sweaty Azad said right after finishing a set of jumping jacks. ""This is our order, and I'm going to follow it."" The Punjab police department ordered Azad and tens of thousands of his fellow officers to shape up because police officials said they couldn't find enough fit officers to fill jobs at 40 new state-of-the-art police stations that are scheduled to open by the end of the year. ""We saw many of our officers were getting a little big around the waist, so they are bound to do this,"" said Deputy Police Chief Sheikh Iftikhar. The directive calls for the department's 175,000 officers to shrink their waists to a maximum of 40 inches. The police chief will be doing unannounced fitness tests throughout the month, officials said. The stakes are high. Pakistan's police officers are often on the front line in the fight against violent extremist groups that have increasingly moved to urban areas and major cities. ""They are responsible police officers. They can do it,"" Iftikhar said, when asked if the police force will shape up. The police department is helping. At police headquarters in Lahore, officials have hired a brawny champion ex-wrestler to take fitness trainees through two-hour workouts that start in the weight room and finish in an outdoor exercise yard where officers do aerobics and other fat-burning workouts. The last time Azad exercised was in 1991. His form is far from perfect, and the exercise equipment is old and rusty, but he is determined to shrink his waist and keep his job. ""Our hearts are made of stone,"" he said. ""No matter what we're asked, we'll do it.""","Punjab police department has ordered tens of thousands of officers to shape up .

"(CNN) -- Arnold Schwarzenegger said he blames no one but himself for the breakup of his 25-year marriage to Maria Shriver, whom he described as the only true love of his life. ""It's my fault. There's no one else to blame,"" the former California governor told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" in an interview that aired Tuesday. ""I ... screwed up badly and I take the full blame for it."" Shriver filed for divorce last year shortly after Schwarzenegger acknowledged that he fathered a child outside marriage with the family's longtime housekeeper. He said he still hopes to win Shriver back. ""I love my kids dearly, and I love Maria ... She has been truly the only love that I've ever had and that's what is so pitiful about it,"" he said, describing her as extraordinary and ""the most perfect wife."" Schwarzenegger admits habit of keeping secrets, including multiple affairs . Schwarzenegger and Shriver have four children together. He characterized the affair as ""just about the stupidest thing that any human being can do."" ""All of a sudden, from one day to the next, the personal life totally crashed and I wiped out everything, you know, that I had. I mean the thing that I cherished the most was my personal life, was my marriage and was my family. I always thought that it was one of my greatest accomplishments,"" Schwarzenegger said. The actor and former world-class bodybuilder touted his recent autobiography, ""Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story,"" which he said delves into both the good and the bad in his life. The native Austrian became an international celebrity in the 1970s as a bodybuilder, capturing four Mr. Universe titles before turning his attention to movies and becoming one of Hollywood's most bankable stars. He went on to become governor of California, a position he held until his term ended in January 2011. Since then, he has remained in the public eye and returned to the silver screen. His success, he said, came in part from his ability to visualize what he wanted as a child. ""I always ... had a vision, and the vision was so real that I really felt that I can accomplish and turn those visions into reality,"" he said. It took a ""hell of a lot of work,"" Schwarzenegger said, but he was willing to put in the time. Speaking a day before President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney will face off in their first debate, he was asked if he had any advice for the candidates. ""The most important thing is to be real, he said. ""To be as honest as possible, and not to drop a lot of numbers and facts and statistics, because people don't remember that. You've got to be able to look right into the screen and to communicate with the people."" Schwarzenegger: 'I inflicted tremendous pain on Maria' Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- A top human rights advocacy group on Friday denounced what it claimed were the overnight executions of nine prisoners in Gambia, calling President Yahya Jammeh's stated intent to clear death row after a decades-long moratorium ""a step back."" The reports of the executions were the first since the Gambian president announced several days ago that he wanted all inmates sentenced to death to be executed by mid-September. The tiny West African nation had last executed a prisoner about 30 years ago. Citing what it deemed ""reliable sources,"" Amnesty International reported in a statement that eight men and one woman were taken from their prison cells on Thursday and killed. Three of those allegedly executed had been sentenced for treason, and two of the nine were Senegalese, said the group. ""We strongly denounce the executions of the nine and see this as a step back for the country,"" Amnesty spokesman Alex Edwards told CNN on Friday. ""The president should issue a moratorium and cease all executions."" By the end of last year, Gambia had at least 42 people on death row, including two women, according to human rights activists. Three men have since received a death sentence this year, Amnesty said. Jammeh announced the new policy -- though it wasn't unclear what prompted him to change the stance -- in a speech on state media Sunday that was rebroadcast Monday. ""All punishments prescribed by law will be maintained in the country to ensure that criminals get what they deserve: that is, that those who kill are killed,"" he said. ""By the middle of next month, all the death sentences would have been carried out to the letter."" The nation imposes capital punishment for various crimes, including murder and treason, the latter commonly used to stifle dissent in some African nations. In 2010, British human rights group Reprieve said Gambia introduced the death penalty for those found with more than 250 grams of cocaine or heroin. It's unclear whether that law still stands. In 2009, Jammeh made a similar threat to resume executions, but did not act on it, Amnesty said. Jammeh took power in a military coup in 1994 and was elected president two years later. Gambia's human rights record has drawn steady criticism since his election, but the president has won supporters by building new hospitals, schools and other infrastructure. CNN's Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","Gambian authorities take 9 inmates from their cells and execute them, Amnesty says .

"(CNN) -- A shooter who fired at vehicles and individuals Sunday from woods in northern Washington state remains at large, as law enforcement ordered residents to stay in their homes and others to stay away as they hunted for the suspect. Authorities got a call shortly after 1:30 p.m. PT (4:30 p.m. ET) Sunday from a man who said he'd been shot in the leg near his home in Arlington, a community of about 18,000 people roughly 50 miles north of Seattle. The wounded man told law enforcement, who arrived within about 10 minutes, that he had been hearing gunshots for about 10 minutes in the ""wooded, largely rural area,"" according to Lt. Steve Dittoe of the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office. ""Immediately the officers ... recognized that there was someone in the woods shooting at either vehicles or people,"" said Dittoe. Gunman kills 2, himself at supermarket . A SWAT team was dispatched to the area and soon came under fire, according to the lieutenant. He said that he did not know how many rounds had been fired, beyond saying an armored personnel vehicle was hit in what he described as ""a lot of shooting this afternoon -- at us."" Parts of Jim Creek Road, where the shootings took place, have been closed off to traffic. Meanwhile, those who live in the immediate vicinity are being urged to not leave their homes, Dittoe said. The lone person shot suffered a non-life-threatening injury and has been transported from the scene. No suspect has been identified, with the sheriff's spokesman saying there's no reason yet to ""tie the shooter to any residence along this road."" ""I have no information as to why someone would be doing this, at this point,"" Dittoe added when asked about the shooter's motive. Lawyer: Aurora suspect called college before shooting . Law enforcement officers from multiple jurisdictions converged on the area, searching the woods and combing the neighborhood in an effort to ""make sure that we get this neighborhood safe before we leave,"" the sheriff's lieutenant said. By late Sunday afternoon, Dittoe said that ""we believe we have the area contained"" where the threat exists, though they have yet to track down the suspect. ""We are going to stay out here until we are sure that this community is safe and that we have dealt with anyone out here who has a firearm and was shooting at people,"" he said.","A man tells police he was shot in the leg in a town north of Seattle .

"(CNN) -- ""No poo"" sounds like a swimming pool rule, but to some it also means washing hair with baking soda and vinegar instead of shampoo. Tiffany Burke, 31, says she might try it soon, with a goal of becoming as natural and organic as possible. ""I'm, like, 60% there,"" she says about her use of organic products. ""I would say I'm in the middle, because there are still lots of moms who just don't care."" Burke is pregnant and due in November. But the twins she is carrying aren't her biological or legal children. As a surrogate mother, she's carrying fetuses formed by her brother's sperm and her sister-in-law's egg. CNN's ""Sanjay Gupta, MD"" is profiling the legal and emotional issues surrounding Burke's surogate pregnancy. Burke's interest in natural and organic products began when she was expecting her first child and read the best-selling pregnancy book ""What To Expect When You're Expecting."" Some passages suggest that chemicals and pesticides in our food and cosmetics, although legal, may nonetheless be causing harm. Burke wanted to know more. ""I would just Google and hope for the best. I'd just keep going and going until I saw enough evidence that to me said, just avoid it. Just don't put that in your body,"" she says. Eight years later, how she chooses what to buy is a far cry from how she was raised, Burke says. When sister-in-law Natalie Lucich had to have her uterus removed because a complication with her last pregnancy led to uncontrolled bleeding, Burke offered to carry her next child. Lucich was overjoyed. Surrogate sisters: The ultimate gift . Now, Lucich relies on Burke to make all the right choices for her baby. ""She is organic, and she does know everything that's going into her body. She reads labels,"" says Lucich. ""You never know when you're hiring some surrogate to do it, what they're doing to their bodies."" The FDA says common chemicals like BPA, phthalates and pesticides are safe, but research shows they pass from mother to child, and may be neurotoxins in the womb. So Burke is like her own regulatory agency, learning as much as possible about the safety of every product on the shelf. She says she doesn't want to take any risks. Artificial food colorings linked to ADHD in children have been banned from Burke's home. She stores food in glass containers, not plastic. Even though she might experiment with making her own shampoo, she's passionate about the natural products already on store shelves. Burke brushes with Tom's of Maine toothpaste, she does laundry with Seventh Generation detergent and she loves ""Organic wear"" makeup by Physicians Formula. FDA says it will deny request to ban BPA . Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, says Burke is smart to be proactive. ""We've come to understand that if you take some reasonable steps you can dramatically reduce your exposure to a lot of different chemicals,"" says Cook. ""If you're going to wait for the government to take action, you could be in store for a lot of exposure."" With the joy of surrogacy comes the burden of responsibility for Burke. If anything goes wrong with her pregnancy, she says she couldn't help asking herself, ""What did I do?"" Still, even careful shoppers like Burke get caught off guard. She felt good about buying BPA-free sippy cups for her toddler until she came across an article explaining that manufacturers can replace the BPA in plastic with similar chemicals like Bisphenol-S, and still label their product ""BPA-free"". ""I never knew that. I had no clue. So last week I spent two hours online looking for sippy cups that were not plastic,"" says Burke. When asked whether she avoids canned goods because research shows many cans' interior linings leach BPA into the food inside, Burke says, ""I didn't know that. I'm super cranky about that."" She immediately sought information online and found the website for Annie's Homegrown, which makes her favorite soups. She found a statement saying, ""We continue to work diligently with our vendors and supply partners to find a can lining without BPA. We are also exploring other package solutions."" ""Boooo,"" Burke says. ""It never crossed my mind. Why would there be BPA in cans?"" To Cook, it's a familiar story. ""Eating less canned food, which comes as a surprise to a lot of people, is an important first step,"" he says. ""People are beginning to understand that the environment is not something that's just external to us; it's not polar bears and wilderness and ice floes in the Arctic or forests. It's something we metabolize day in and day out.""","Tiffany Burke is carrying twins for her brother and sister-in-law .

"(CNN) -- It is a momentous day for Georgian democracy -- but a painful one for the man who has led the former Soviet republic for nearly a decade. For the first time in the strategically important former Soviet state, power is set to be transferred by free and fair elections instead of revolution. As the results became clear, President Mikheil Saakashvili, a larger-than-life figure who was swept to power in 2003, appeared on national television to accept defeat. After summing up the preliminary election results it is evident that the Georgian Dream coalition has achieved the advantage, he said, pledging not to hold up the process. But it must be a painful political blow to a man swept to power nine years ago in the popular Rose Revolution. Bogged down and damaged by accusations of authoritarianism and human rights abuse, including appalling images that emerged last month of prison inmates being physically and sexually abused in a Georgian jail, his once popular support appears to have slid away. Georgia's ruling party concedes defeat in parliamentary elections . Ambitions of Georgian membership into the European Union and the NATO military alliance tormented Russia with whom Georgia fought a brief war in 2008. They may be less of a priority for the new government now. The prime minister-elect, who will take the reigns of power from Saakashvili next year, is Bidzina Ivanishvili, a controversial 56-year-old billionaire who made his fortune in Russia during the 1990s. With interests in iron ore, banks, pharmaceuticals and real estate, Ivanishvili grew up in Georgia's rural west. He is now estimated by Forbes magazine to be the 153rd richest man in the world, with assets worth more than half of tiny GeorgiaÂ¹s GDP. His eccentric tastes include a number of pet penguins he keeps in a private zoo, along with a zebra and other exotic beasts. A multi-million dollar art collection, including works by Picasso, Gilbert & George and Roy Lichtenstein, is mainly housed in secure vaults in London, while he displays exact reproductions in his towering, James Bond-style glass palace in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital. During a bitter election campaign, government officials accused him of wanting to turn his back on Europe, NATO and the United States, to return Georgia to Russia's sphere of influence. More darkly, critics accused him of being part of a Kremlin conspiracy to topple Georgia's pro-Western leadership. But that is an accusation he adamantly denies, telling CNN he merely wants to repair shattered links with Moscow and has no intention of turning his back on the West. ""Restoring relations with the Kremlin is one of our main tasks, and we will strive in every way to do this,"" he said. ""First, we have to convince the Kremlin that our strategy towards NATO and Europe is not harmful to and does not contradict Russian interests,"" he added. For its part, the Kremlin -- whose tanks still occupy two breakaway regions of Georgia that Moscow recognizes as independent countries -- remained tight-lipped throughout the Georgian campaign. Only now has there been comment from Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. ""If these results will become a reality, then [the] Georgian political landscape will be more diverse,"" he told Russian media. ""It should be welcome because it probably means that more responsible and constructive forces are coming to the parliament,"" he said. If that means Russia and Georgia can rebuild ties without sacrificing the achievements of the past decade, this may be a momentous day in Georgian democracy indeed.","For the first time, power is set to be transferred by free and fair elections instead of revolution .

"Detroit, Michigan (CNN) -- Six men appeared in federal court Thursday, a day after they were arrested in raids targeting an African-American Muslim group that the FBI said sought to establish an Islamic state in the United States. Luqman Ameen Abdullah, the alleged leader of the African-American Muslim converts, was fatally shot during one of Wednesday's raids in the Detroit area after he fired at law enforcement agents who were trying to arrest him and four other suspects. An FBI dog was also killed. Authorities say Abdullah was the imam at a Detroit mosque where he preached offensive jihad, including violence against the U.S. government and law enforcement. A criminal complaint states that he repeatedly told three confidential informants he would never be taken alive, saying ""If they're coming to get me, I'll just strap a bomb on and blow up everybody."" Abdullah was one of 11 men charged Tuesday with conspiracy to commit federal crimes, including theft from interstate shipments, mail fraud to obtain the proceeds of arson, illegal possession and sale of firearms, and tampering with motor vehicle identification numbers, the FBI said in a news release. Eight suspects were in custody, including one man already in prison on an unrelated charge and another man who was arrested on Wednesday and added to the charging sheet, U.S. Attorney spokeswoman Susan Plochinski said Thursday. An additional suspect was taken into custody in Canada on Thursday, an FBI statement said. Two men remain at large. Mujahid Carswell, aka Mujahid Abdullah, was taken into custody in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, by Canadian authorities Thursday afternoon, the FBI said. According to the federal criminal complaint, Carswell, 30, is the eldest son of Abdullah, who was killed in the raid Wednesday. Canadian Border Patrol is holding him on immigration violations, the FBI said. Of the six suspects who appeared Thursday afternoon in court, Abdullah Beard was ordered held without bail; and Muhammad Abdul Salaam's bail decision was delayed, as was that for Gary Laverne Porter, a 38-year teacher who was arrested at an area school. Ali Abdul Raqib was given a $10,000 unsecured bond; Abdul Saboor was given a $100,000 bond, despite a prosecution request that he be held without bond. Another man, Acie Pusha, who was arrested Wednesday, was described by the prosecutor as ""minimally involved"" and given a $10,000 bond. The FBI criminal complaint says the group held target practice in a mosque basement, blowing holes in concrete walls. It includes references to possible attacks on the government, including Detroit's federal building and the FBI. There is also discussion about causing trouble at the 2006 Super Bowl in Detroit. But the men were not arrested for any of that. Two law enforcement sources said the information about possible attacks was included in the charging document to add ""context for the crimes they're charged with, the purpose of the group."" ""They had to earn money for their mosque and the Ummah,"" one of the sources said. ""And the purpose of Ummah was to set up a separatist state."" Ummah refers to the nationwide group to which the suspects belonged, according to the complaint. It's a group made up of mostly African-American members, including some who converted to Islam while in prison. Ummah is led by Jamil Abdullah al-Amin -- formerly known as H. Rap Brown -- a 1960s radical and former member of the Black Panthers who once said ""violence was as American as cherry pie."" He is serving a life sentence in Colorado's Supermax prison for killing two Georgia police officers. Andrew Arena, the FBI special agent in charge of the investigation, contacted local imams and civil rights leaders in Detroit during Wednesday's operation ""to bridge any gaps that could possible come over this,"" FBI spokeswoman Sandra Berchtold said. ""He'd rather they hear it from him,"" she added. ""We have a good relationship with the community and we want to keep it that way."" In the 43-page criminal complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Michigan and unsealed Wednesday, authorities said the arrests were made based on information gleaned from confidential sources identified only as S-1, S-2 and S-3. ""S-1 heard Abdullah encourage his followers to 'pick up guns and do something' rather than try to achieve their goals through peaceful means,"" the complaint said. S-2 recorded a conversation on December 12, 2007, in which Abdullah said, ""I got some soldiers with me, so it's not like I, I don't have, you know, nothing. Brothers that I know would, you know, if I say 'Let's go, we going to go and do something,' they would do it,"" the complaint said. S-3 said that, on March 21, 2008, Luqman Abdullah told him ""that the FBI is the enemy of Islam,"" the complaint said. The other men charged were identified as: . • Mohammad Abdul Bassir, aka Franklin D. Roosevelt Williams. He is serving a prison term at Ojibway Correctional Facility in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. • Mujahid Carswell. • Mohammad Philistine. • Yassir Ali Khan. • Adam Hussain Ibraheem. Acie Pusha was arrested on Wednesday and added to the charging sheet, Plochinski said Thursday. She would not provide details about the charges against Pusha. The two charged but still at large are Philistine, also known as Mohammad Alsahi, a 33-year-old resident of Ontario; and Khan, 30, who is believed to be a resident of Ontario and Warren, Michigan. All of the defendants ""are members of a group that is alleged to have engaged in violent activity over a period of many years, and known to be armed,"" the FBI said. The complaint was filed by the FBI's counter-terrorism squad in the Eastern District of Michigan. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Carol Cratty and Ross Levitt contributed to this story.","NEW: Six appear in federal court Thursday, a day after they were arrested in raids .

"Denver (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney face off on Wednesday in the first of three presidential debates. While Obama holds a lead in several key battleground states, the race nationally has been locked in a dead heat for months. The debate offers an opportunity for Obama or Romney to gain some momentum and break the logjam. Here are five things to watch for on Wednesday: . 1. Who's presidential? The first and most important test for the president and Romney in this opening debate is to act like they belong in the job. We've heard a lot of bickering on the campaign trail, and there's plenty of talk that zingers could decide who wins or loses the showdown in Denver. But to most Americans, this debate is really about which candidate has the composure and stature to serve in the Oval Office. What they stand for: Candidates at a glance . ""If either the president or Romney can't pass this test, the rest really don't matter. Big ideas from a small person won't make you president of the United States,"" says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. ""When the moment comes, this is like proposing to your wife. This is a big moment."" Thanks to already serving nearly four years in the White House, Obama starts with the advantage, but he can't afford to play it safe at the debate. John King: The debates are all about trust . ""Playing it safe allows Romney to dominate the agenda and put Obama on defense. Either you're on offense or defense, and defense loses,"" adds Castellanos, who was a senior adviser to Romney in 2008 election. By comparison, Romney has to do double duty: Stay on offense but also look presidential. What does Obama have to do? ""Keep cool -- which comes naturally to him,"" says Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala. ""Make it about the middle class, not himself or Romney."" 2. Can Romney get Libya into the discussion? The first debate is officially devoted to domestic policy. The listed topics, according to the Commission on Presidential Debates, are the economy, health care, the role of government and governing -- whatever that means. Matters of national security and foreign policy are being left to later debates, but Romney may not be content to wait that long with the drip-drip-drip of conflicting news continuing to emerge from Libya, where four Americans -- including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens -- were killed in an apparent terrorist attack last month. Serious questions have been raised for the Obama administration in the wake of the Libya attack: Was the American compound in Benghazi secure before the attack? Did U.S. officials fail to heed warnings or concerns about possible violence? Why has the president been so hesitant to describe the incident as a ""terrorist attack""? Why is the scene still not secure, more than two weeks after the attack? House GOP wants State Dept. to answer for Libya security . ""We've seen a confused, slow, inconsistent response to what is now very clearly known as a terrorist act,"" Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan said on Monday. ""It's really indicative of a broader failure of this administration's foreign policy and the crisis that is taking place across the Middle East."" Polls indicate that the economy remains the top issue for voters, and Romney advisers in Boston believe the same. And when it comes to foreign policy, more voters trust Obama than Romney, polls show. But there are hints of vulnerability for the president on Libya crisis. In a recent Fox News poll, 43% of voters said they disapproved of Obama's performance on Libya, while 39% approved. With his campaign scrambling for traction and looking for any opportunity to shrink the trust gap between himself and the president, it won't be a shocker if Romney brings up the Middle East turmoil on Wednesday night and ties it to a broader critique of the president's leadership. Obama, Romney only met a few times . 3. Who makes the case on the economy? In a debate focusing on domestic concerns, the economy is the issue that should dominate the debate. The economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters and according to a new CNN/ORC International poll, likely voters are split on whether the president or the Republican nominee would do a better job fixing the economy over the next four years. Expect to hear two very different narratives on Wednesday night. The president will continue to argue that the country's making progress and that now is not the time to go back to the policies of the George W. Bush years that got us into the current mess. And he'll say that now's not the time to go back to helping the millionaires and Wall Street. Expect a very different narrative from Romney. In his year and a half long bid for the White House, one of the former Massachusetts governor's main arguments is that thanks to his business background, he can do a better job creating jobs than Obama has done over the past four years. The debate in Denver gives Romney a well-watched platform to make his case. Romney: Debates aren't about a win . Romney ""has to explain a rationale that he's offering change that would make things better over the next four years,"" says Castellanos. ""This is his opportunity to present his counternarrative, that Obama's growing the wrong economy. He need say that Washington's economy is doing just fine, and ask how your economy's doing."" Whichever candidate better presents and sells his economic narrative will go a long way toward determining who wins the debate, and more importantly, who wins the minds of undecided voters. 4. Can Obama get women and Latinos into the discussion? Romney carved out positions during the Republican primaries that have landed him in a deep hole with Hispanic and female voters. Remember the so-called ""war on women""? In the course of trying to out-conservative his GOP rivals, Romney vowed to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood, came out against a law that mandates insurance companies cover contraception services and did not take a stand on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act that Obama signed in 2009. He has also said he wants the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Romney also rankled Hispanics by calling elements of Arizona's tough immigration law a ""model"" for the nation, floating the notion of ""self-deportation"" and promising to veto the DREAM Act, which would offer a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants. Latino vote in Nevada up for grabs . The Obama campaign has exploited these positions to great effect, pushing them to women and Hispanics in swing state campaign appearances, targeted e-mails and niche media efforts. (Don't know who Cristina Saralegui is? Google her.) Republicans have criticized those tactics as a cynical distraction from the sagging economy, but they're working. A Quinnipiac poll of Ohio likely voters released last week, for instance, showed Romney losing women to Obama by a staggering 25-point margin. Internal Romney polling, meanwhile, has him badly trailing Obama among Hispanics -- and it's been that way all year. With more than 50 million people expected to tune in Wednesday evening, don't expect the president to pass up a golden opportunity to keep female and Hispanic-oriented issues in the national spotlight. In debates, presidential candidates' tics and tells matter . 5. Taking the zing out of zingers . It was just one line in a New York Times story last weekend about each candidate's debate cram sessions, but it grabbed a lot of attention. ""Mr. Romney's team has concluded that debates are about creating moments and has equipped him with a series of zingers that he has memorized and has been practicing on aides since August,"" reporters Ashley Parker and Peter Baker wrote in the paper. Obama: 'They're making me do my homework' Romney advisers are correct that voters are likely to walk away from the debate talking about distinctive moments -- audible sighs, body language, repeated use of phrases such as ""lock box"" -- rather than factoids about Medicare Advantage or sequestration. But zingers? The Obama team predictably pounced on that one. iReporters square off before the debate . ""We also saw in reports that Mitt Romney and his team have been working on zingers and special lines for months,"" Obama spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki told reporters over the weekend. ""That's not what the president's focus is on. So if you're expecting that, that's probably not what he's going to deliver on."" Romney delivered his lines with precision during the Republican primary debates and probably will again on Wednesday. But if it comes to pass that Romney jabs at Obama with a sharp attack or humorous quip, you can be sure the president's allies will be ready to mock Romney's reliance on prepared ""zingers"" to diminish his stature and performance.

"New York (CNN) -- A 25-year-old man was charged with trespassing for jumping out of a monorail car into the Bronx Zoo's tiger den because he wanted ""to be one"" with the animal, police said Saturday. David Villalobos, who is hospitalized in stable condition, said ""his leap was definitely not a suicide attempt, but a desire to be one with the tiger,"" according to Paul Browne, the NYPD's chief spokesman. Villalobos was riding on the zoo's Wild Asia monorail around 3 p.m. Friday when he jumped out of the rail car, ""clearing the exhibit's perimeter fence"" and landing in the den, according to Bronx Zoo Director Jim Breheny. Villalobos suffered a broken right shoulder, broken rib, collapsed lung, broken ankle, broken pelvis and puncture wounds, according to police spokesman Brian Sessa. He later claimed to have pet one of the tigers before it backed off, Sessa added. The spokesman said Villalobos was charged with trespassing and criminal trespassing. An arraignment has not yet been set. Zoo officials said rescuers used a fire extinguisher to separate the man and the animal. Heeding instructions, Villalobos rolled ""under a hot wire to safety,"" and the tiger backed off, Breheny said. The zoo uses so-called hot wires -- or electrically charged cables -- as training tools to keep animals away from such areas as plant beds. If the animal comes into contact with the wire, it feels a small electric shock. Villalobos' decision to follow instructions and roll under the wire ""probably saved his life,"" Breheny told reporters Friday. He was ""conscious and talking"" as he was taken by ambulance to Jacobi Medical Center in Bronx, New York. ""I think it's safe to say that if the tiger really wanted to do harm to this individual he certainly had the time to do it,"" Breheny said. ""This is just an extraordinary occurrence that happened because ... somebody was deliberately trying to endanger themselves."" The exhibit is called Tiger Mountain and houses Siberian tigers as well as Malayan tigers, according to the Bronx Zoo's website. The Bronx Zoo is the city's flagship park run by the Wildlife Conservation Society.","NEW: The man faces trespassing charges .

"(CNN) -- A man who posted a video online showing deplorable conditions in his son's barracks at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, said Tuesday that ""good things are happening"" regarding repairs. A soldier battles overflowing sewage in the Fort Bragg barracks shortly after coming home from Afghanistan. ""I had been in those barracks three times in the last four years,"" Edward Frawley told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""I saw the condition and chose to ignore it, but two weeks ago I couldn't. ... I knew I couldn't walk away from it. Somebody had to do something."" Frawley's son, Sgt. Jeff Frawley, is living in the barracks after returning from a 15-month deployment to Afghanistan. Edward Frawley's 10-minute video shows still photos from throughout the barracks, which include shots of mold and rust in several areas. The video is posted on the popular file-sharing site YouTube and Frawley's business Web site. Paint, which Frawley says is lead-based, is chipping off. Ceiling tiles are missing. A broken drain pipe allows sewer gas into the building, while another one has tissues stuffed into it in an apparent effort to stop the gas from coming in. Photos from the communal bathroom show some of the most disturbing images. In one, a soldier stands in a sink to avoid what Frawley says is 3 inches of sewage that covered the floor when toilets overflowed.  Watch the run-down conditions that soldiers have been living in » . At times, ""sewage water backs up into the sinks in the lower floors of these barracks,"" Frawley says in his narration. Also, ""The soldiers have to tell one another who's taking a shower when they turn the sinks on, or the person taking the shower gets scalded with hot water,"" he says . Edward Frawley said Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Dick Cody called him on Monday to say that he shared his anger and that there was no excuse for soldiers living in such conditions. ""He talked to me for 30 minutes, and I believe what he said,"" Frawley told ""American Morning."" ""He said he wouldn't want his sons coming back and going into these kinds of living conditions, and he just said somebody dropped the ball and they're going to fix it."" Frawley said the Army had promised to have new barracks ready when his son's unit, part of the 82nd Airborne Division, returned from Afghanistan. ""The conditions depicted in Mr. Frawley's video are appalling and unacceptable, and we are addressing the concerns he expressed,"" Maj. Tom Earnhardt, spokesman for the 82nd Airborne, said in a written statement. ""Our paratroopers are our most valuable resource, and our commitment is to their well-being. Our actions now must represent the best we can do for our soldiers."" He added, ""Fundamentally, we acknowledge these conditions are not adequate by today's standards. The images in Mr. Frawley's video are alarming, and our soldiers deserve the best conditions we can provide as an institution."" U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina is among government officials who have responded to the video. In a written statement, she called living conditions in the barracks ""unacceptable"" and said the situation ""must be immediately corrected."" A group of congressional staffers toured Fort Bragg on Tuesday. Earnhardt told CNN the building had been mostly unused during the 15 months Sgt. Frawley and his unit were away. Fort Bragg has a massive construction project under way to create new housing, but it is behind schedule, Earnhardt said.  Watch what the Army is building for soldiers » . He told CNN on Tuesday that there were 40 work orders on the barracks before the video was made, and only seven of them were incomplete when the pictures were taken. Most repairs have since been made, Earnhardt said, and soldiers are housed in the barracks. Edward Frawley told CNN on Tuesday that the Army has ""done a lot in the last two weeks"" to fix up the barracks. ""My son is in a tough situation because he wants to make the military his career,"" he said. ""Gen. Cody and the colonels ... guaranteed me this wouldn't come back on him. He had nothing to do with it. ""[Cody] agrees that the pictures are accurate. He doesn't want his men living in conditions like that. ... Who wants their sons living in that?"" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Jose Maria Olazabal has confirmed he will not continue in his role as Europe's Ryder Cup captain after the weekend's memorable win over the United States. Europe retained the prestigious trophy by beating Davis Love III's team 14½ - 13½ at the Medinah Country Club, despite having trailed by four points heading into Sunday's singles matches. But after helping Europe keep hold of the cup it won in 2010, Spain's Olazabal believes it is time to for another captain to take charge. ""First of all it is a lot of work,"" the two-time major winner told a news conference. ""It takes a lot from you you during the stretch of time from when you are named captain to the actual playing of the Ryder Cup. U.S. stunned by European fightback . ""On top of that there are a lot of players who should have the opportunity to be in my spot ... clearly I won't do it again."" Olazabal would be happy to offer advice to his successor, although he says he will also not force himself on the next incumbent -- with Irishman Paul McGinley, a vice-captain in Illinois, the early favorite to replace the Spaniard. ""The captain has to decide what he wants,"" added the 46-year-old Olazabal. ""If he wants to reach out to me, fine. But I'm not going to be in there, I'm going to be just on the side. ""I think this is a one-time chance. I had my chance and now I will step back, try to concentrate on my game and leave the next captain to do his job."" Did the U.S. throw away the Ryder Cup? Olazabal also revealed how Europe's triumph -- dubbed the ""Miracle of Medinah"" -- has prompted congratulatory messages from Spanish royalty and the nation's top sports stars. ""The King of Spain called me a few minutes ago and was pretty much over the moon, like me,"" he said. ""There have been messages from sports guys like [tennis player Rafael] Nadal and lots from friends and family."" Europe's challenge could have been derailed before it got off the ground when world No. 1 Rory McIlroy arrived at the golf course late on Sunday. The two-time major winner was confused over which time zone he was in. Luckily for Olazabal, the Northern Irishman was driven to Medinah by a state trooper and was able to win his match with U.S. rookie Keegan Bradley. ""Obviously, we were a little concerned but we knew at 11:05 he was going to make it to the tee with no problems. That's why I was not all that tense,"" said Olazabal. ""Luckily enough a police car was there and he made it on time. It was no surprise at all he managed to win his point."" Olazabal was also asked to select his highlight of the weekend, opting for Ian Poulter's fifth consecutive birdie on the 18th hole of Saturday's fourballs to give Europe a vital point. ""It's hard to just pick one but I think the putt Poulter made on 18 on Saturday afternoon was huge. We all knew how important that was. If that didn't happen I don't think we'd have had a chance to win. It was crucial.""","Jose Maria Olazabal will not continue as Europe's Ryder Cup captain .

"(CNN) -- The Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, office of a Lebanese television station was shut down after the station aired an interview with a Saudi man who bragged about his sex life, authorities said. Saudi authorities closed the office of the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., or LBC for two reasons, Abdul-Rahman Al-Hazza, spokesman for Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Culture and Information, told CNN: ""No valid operating license and a violation of media policy in Saudi Arabia."" LBC is mainly owned by Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal. Al-Hazza said LBC violated the media policy by filming and subsequently airing an episode of its popular show, ""A Thick Red Line,"" featuring Mazen Abdul Jawad, a 32-year-old airline employee and divorced father of four who spoke openly about his sexual escapades, his love of sex and losing his virginity at age 14. Abdul Jawad also is shown in his bedroom, where he holds sexual aids up to the camera. The episode ends with him cruising the streets of Jeddah in his car looking for women. The episode caused an uproar in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia, where Shariah, or strict Islamic law, is practiced. Premarital sex is illegal, and unrelated men and women are not permitted to mingle. The segment in question has been posted on the video-sharing site YouTube since its initial broadcast last month and has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Local media reported Abdul Jawad was arrested a few days after the program aired and has been detained since last week. Some reports have suggested he could face punishments as severe as flogging or even the death penalty for the alleged crime of publicizing vice. Suleiman Al-Mutawae, acting spokesman for Jeddah police, told Arab News, an English-language daily newspaper in Saudi Arabia, that speaking about promiscuous acts ""is a violation of the Shariah regulations on the one hand and against Saudi customs on the other."" All newspapers require government permission to publish in Saudi Arabia. Before Abdul Jawad's detention, Arab News reported he initiated a damage-control campaign, apologized for his comments and was considering filing a complaint against the show's producers for presenting him ""in the worst possible manner by taking two hours of footage and condensing it down to a minute-long segment."" CNN has been unable to reach Abdul Jawad or his lawyer for comment. LBC has not commented on the situation. Asked how long LBC's Jeddah offices will be closed, Al-Hazza said it was ""too early to ask that question"" but noted that only the Jeddah offices of the channel had been shut down. LBC's Riyadh office remains open, he said.","Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. office in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, shut down .

"(CNN) -- A member of Somalia's newly formed parliament was gunned down Saturday in front of his house, later succumbing to his injuries at a nearby hospital, according to government and U.N. reports. Unidentified armed men shot Mustafa Haji Maalim in Mogadishu, and he later died at a hospital, the U.N. special representative for Somalia said in statement condemning his killing. The attack comes amid a wave of violence in the east African nation in recent weeks that has left dozens dead. It has also been a time of significant transition, with Somalia adopting a provisional constitution, selecting members of parliament, appointing that legislative body's speaker and naming a new president. ""These cowardly acts of targeted assassinations and indiscriminate bombings cannot deter the remarkable courage of the Somali people, whose tenacity and determination has overcome formidable obstacles and brought us to where we are now,"" said Augustine P. Mahiga, the special U.N. representative. Maalim was the father-in-law of former Somali President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, according to the United Nations. Ahmed was in power from 2009 until he was recently succeeded by Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, a political newcomer who has worked for the United Nations and several international organizations. The Somalian government reported on its website that Maalim had been shot dead. Various witnesses told private Somali news outlets, including Shabelle Media Network and Garowe News, that at least two masked men shot Maalim in the southern district of Waberi in the Somali capital. The gunmen escaped before security forces arrived at the scene, according to the witnesses. Somalia's shaky transitional government, backed by African Union peacekeepers, has been battling Islamic guerrillas for years. The country has lacked an effective central government since 1991, with portions of the Horn of Africa nation left lawless. Just after sunset on Thursday, a suicide bombing in Mogadishu killed several people, the National Union of Somali Journalists said. The dead included two anchors for state-run Radio Mogadishu and the head of another official radio station, the Voice of Democracy, the two stations reported.","Parliamentarian Mustafa Haji Maalim dies after being shot, the government says .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Zimbabwe Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai was in stable condition and recovering from head injuries Friday night after a car wreck that killed his wife, Susan, medical sources told CNN. Tsvangirai and his wife, Susan, were en route to the prime minister's hometown of Buhera. The crash, on a busy two-lane highway between Tsvangirai's hometown of Buhera and the capital city of Harare, comes just weeks after the start of a power-sharing agreement between Tsvangirai and his political rival, President Robert Mugabe. Analysts say the crash is bound to raise suspicion of foul play, with one former U.S. diplomat calling for an outside investigation, saying it is not the first time that a political foe of Mugabe has been killed or injured in a car crash. Members of Tsvangirai's political party, the Movement for Democratic Change, said Friday that it was too early to tell whether the crash is anything other than an accident. Tsvangirai's aide and driver also were injured in the head-on collision with a large truck, according to his spokesman, James Maridadi. Movement for Democratic Change spokesman Nelson Chamisa said he spoke to Tsvangirai at the hospital, and the party leader was in ""relatively stable"" condition.  An MDC spokesman describes 'critical' accident » . Sources at The Avenues Clinic in Harare said that Tsvangirai was in stable condition with minor head injuries and that the prime minister was alert and talking. One source said the attending doctor had told him of his wife's death. Another said that doctors were planning to keep Tsvangirai overnight for observation and that specialists were checking his condition. Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe's main opposition leader, took office last month under a power-sharing deal with Mugabe after a contentious election. Tsvangirai's MDC reached the power-sharing agreement with Mugabe in September after months of angry dispute that included violence. More than 200 deaths, mainly those of opposition supporters, were reported leading up to and in the aftermath of the election. ""I'm skeptical about any motor vehicle accident in Zimbabwe involving an opposition figure,"" said Tom McDonald, the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe from 1997 to 2001. ""President Mugabe has a history of strange car accidents when someone lo and behold dies -- it's sort of his M.O. of how they get rid of people they don't like.""  Watch more on the fatal crash » . McDonald cited the 2001 death of Defense Minister Moven Mahachi, Employment Minister Border Gezi's death in 1999 and the death last year of Elliot Manyika, a government minister and former regional governor. All three died in car crashes. ""This is several,"" McDonald said. ""So, when I hear that Tsvangirai was in an accident, it gives me pause."" McDonald, now an attorney with the Washington law firm Baker Hostetler, urged a full investigation by outside authorities. One analyst who studies the region said the collision could ""exacerbate"" the fragile unity government. ""There will undoubtedly be suspicions about the cause of the crash and whether there was foul play involved,"" said Jennifer Cooke, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""At a time when there needs to be confidence-building measures, this incident potentially raises suspicions and undermines the potential for greater cohesion of the government. [There is] huge potential for the agreement to be manipulated by Mugabe."" McDonald, however, was quick to say that traffic accidents are common in Zimbabwe. The highway on which Tsvangirai was traveling is a two-lane road where tractor-trailers are common, vehicles in the country are often in bad shape and drivers often are inexperienced, he said. ""It's certainly plausible that this was just one of those tragic things,"" he said. The collision occurred on the Harare-Masvingo Road as Tsvangirai and his wife headed to his hometown of Buhera, south of the capital, Harare, his spokesman said. The couple, who were married in 1978, have six children, according to the British Broadcasting Corporation. Last month, Susan Tsvangirai told a BBC affiliate that the past decade had been an ""endurance test"" for her husband and his MDC colleagues. ""People went through hell, but they stuck to their ideals to seek change through democratic means,"" she said. ""This was a struggle that we endured with MDC cadres, activists, supporters and peace-loving Zimbabweans. ""To them I say thank you so much for the support they gave the MDC to reach this momentous period."" A former miner and union organizer, Morgan Tsvangirai first ran for president in 2002 against Mugabe, who has been the country's leader since it gained independence from Great Britain in 1980. Since then, Tsvangirai has been charged with treason twice and accused of plotting to assassinate Mugabe. Tsvangirai was arrested and allegedly beaten in 2007. The criminal charges against him were dropped. CNN's Nkepile Mabuse, Alan Silverleib and Doug Gross contributed to this report.","NEW: Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai in stable condition, sources say .

"Sharples, West Virginia (CNN) -- Charles Bella is a retired coal miner who now opposes the type of mining he used to do: mountaintop removal. ""I believe that if they stop mountaintop removal now, it might be too late, but it would help. So much of southern West Virginia is already destroyed,"" Bella said. A new poll shows Bella is not alone in his opinion. Fifty-seven percent of respondents in a CNN/ORC survey released Thursday say they oppose the controversial mining process, in which a mountain is blasted apart and the debris deposited in nearby valleys. The coal is then dug out, and miners work to rebuild the slopes. About one-third of West Virginia's coal is mined this way. ""They are probably not miners,"" Diann Kish said of the poll respondents. A neighbor of Bella's and the wife of a retired miner, she supports the process. Thirty-six percent agree with Kish, according to the poll. Seven percent didn't have an opinion. ""Coal -- let me tell you, this fed our families,"" she said holding a baseball-sized chunk of the black mineral in her hand. ""Doesn't bother me what other people think,"" Kish said. ""It's not their livelihood."" While the work has provided for families, it's not without its drawbacks. Recent studies by West Virginia University associate professor Michael Hendryx find ""multiple illnesses"" in mining areas. ""Higher rates of cancer is one of them. Higher forms of chronic heart disease, heart attacks, and lung disease like (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), kidney disease,"" Hendryx said. ""We have found evidence for all of those."" ""I think it really is the biggest public health problem that West Virginia faces,"" he added. Bill Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal Association and a lobbyist for the coal industry, takes issue with Hendryx's findings. ""I think what you find is there is a correlation as opposed to a causation and it's got to be analyzed,"" he said. He believes Hendryx's studies raise more questions than answers. Raney questions the validity of the CNN/ORC poll, too. ""I think you have to spend some time explaining that mountaintop mining is authorized by federal law, has been for years,"" he said. The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International from July 18 to 20, with 1,009 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The poll's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.","In a CNN/ORC survey, 57% said they oppose mountaintop removal mining.

"Denver (CNN) -- To the political world, October 3 is a high-stakes night in the presidential election. But for first lady Michelle Obama, it's the date night that wasn't. ""I told Barack, 'This, you know, attending a presidential debate on my 20th anniversary is probably the worst way for me to spend (it).' ... I get so nervous at these debates,"" she said in a recent interview alongside her brother, Craig Robinson. 10 debate moments that mattered . Twenty years ago, Michelle Robinson wed Barack Obama in a Chicago ceremony. She never would have predicted spending her 20th wedding anniversary on a double date with the Romneys. ""I would not have chosen this, but I'm excited about it,"" she said. Although the first lady will be in the audience in Denver to watch President Obama debate Wednesday night, she did not offer a critique of her husband, even when pressed. ""I really would probably be the worst person to assess his style or his techniques,"" she said. In fact, she suggested that she worries about her own performance, with all eyes judging her every reaction. 5 things to watch in tonight's debate . ""There are the rules, and you don't want to clap. ... So I'm just trying to make sure I'm following the rules,"" Obama said. She may have jitters on debate day, but she was not nervous when she wed young Barack Obama in 1992. Instead, she was focused on the next step: their honeymoon. ""It was just sort of, 'OK, now we're going to do this, and we'll get it done, and then we'll go on our honeymoon,' "" she remembered. ""So I was really excited about the honeymoon, actually."" As for the groom, he had a cold. ""We were teasing him about 'OK, whatever you do, don't sneeze while you're saying your vows,"" said Robinson, who served as a groomsman. ""I remember we had a big laugh about that."" But the first lady said the future president's congestion vanished at the altar. ""My sister has that affect on people,"" Robinson said with a laugh. Michelle Obama: I can make the president mad . Robinson, the older of the siblings, who coaches the Oregon State University basketball team and has hit the court with his brother-in-law, insisted that the president's playing style is that of a team player. ""One of the first things I saw on the basketball court was his lack of ego,"" Robinson said. ""The game wasn't about him. It was about the game and about his teammates."" Some observers have suggested that it is the first lady who grounds the president and keeps his ego in check, but Obama was adamant that this president is grounded on his own. ""Barack doesn't have a big ego,"" she said. ""That would kind of be the last thing that I would think of when I talk about my husband is big ego, because he doesn't have that. So it's not much to check."" Before the debate, iReporters square off . Their similar values, she said, were part of the reason their union made sense and are something she references on the campaign trail. She has visited all of the battleground states during the 2012 election cycle on behalf of the Democratic ticket, enough stops to have her own stump speech. In her addresses, she describes the values she and her husband hold and how she believes his policies will positively affect voters across the country, particularly those in the middle class. She often says they were both taught the value of hard work. ""We learned that the truth matters, so you don't take shortcuts or game the system or play by your own set of rules,"" she said at a recent campaign stop in Richmond, Virginia, a line oft repeated in her speeches. First lady seeks to reignite flame for president . She declined to discuss Mitt Romney's values in contrast with her husband's, but she did offer a contrast between herself and Ann Romney. The GOP nominee's wife recently told her husband's critics that running for president is hard. But Obama did not echo that sentiment. Ann Romney: 'Dad' is always with Mitt at the debates . ""The campaign experience is unique for everyone. ... For me, I really enjoyed campaigning,"" she said. ""I get energy from it, and I always have. And I've always said that. That it's, I never thought a few years ago that I would enjoy it this much, but I really do."" Despite the first couple's campaign schedule, they make a point to be home for dinner at 6:30 p.m. The president admitted that might contribute to his difficulty cultivating relationships in the nation's capital. But the first lady was quick to defend their schedule, saying there is never a downside to family time and suggesting that the 44th president is setting a good example for other fathers across the country. Family, she said, is ""at the core of this country."" ""I mean, in the end, this is what we're here for,"" she added. ""We're here to make sure that we're giving every family an opportunity to have the kind of stability and opportunities for the future, for themselves and for their kids. And I think the best thing we can do is to model that in our own homes."" She said that the Obamas are trying to provide as normal a life as possible for their two daughters, Malia and Sasha, but that neither she nor the president ""plays the heavy."" ""This is the thing I like about Barack. ... He is very good at reinforcing the rules and boundaries that we set. We never get into that 'but Dad said.' We're very good at not letting the kids play off of us,"" she said. Michelle Obama convention speech dress dazzles, scores . Michelle Obama said the threat of withholding television on the weekends helps keep the girls out of trouble. ""They already have limited TV time,"" she said. ""Trust me, if you only get two hours on Saturday and to lose those two hours, you don't."" Although a childhood in the White House is by no means normal, Robinson claimed they still seem like the girls he knew in Chicago. ""What's amazing for me is to watch, when I come to the White House, it's the White House. ... But inside, in the living quarters, watching my sister and the president operate with their family, it's refreshing, because the only thing that's different is they're in the White House,"" Robinson said. ""It doesn't seem normal, because we're from the South Side of Chicago, but the behavior's all normal."" The first lady said she is too focused on the November election to offer specifics on what her potential second-term agenda would look like but said she would continue work on issues she's championed in the president's first term. She has advocated on behalf of veterans returning home from service and healthy living practices among young people through her Let's Move campaign. She often speaks to women on the campaign trail; the number of them in poverty has grown during President Obama's term to a 17-year high. She said this presidential election ""couldn't be more important for women"" when it comes to equal pay, health care and making decisions about ""our bodies."" ""As a woman and as a mother with two girls, I want to make sure that my daughters make those decisions for themselves,"" Obama said. ""So many issues will impact the quality of our lives as women for decades to come. ... I'm spending a lot of time out there talking to women to make sure that they understand all that's on the line."" Ann Romney touts her husband's softer side .","Obamas will spend 20th wedding anniversary with the Romneys ... at debate .

"(CNN) -- The Vatican expressed rare public anger Wednesday in blasting the leaking of private papers from the pope's apartment, a scandal that observers say lifts the lid on a secret power struggle going on behind the closed doors of the Catholic Church. A top Roman Catholic Church official called the theft of the documents ""an immoral act of unprecedented gravity"" and ""despicable abuse of the relationship of trust that exists between Benedict XVI and those who turn to him."" Archbishop Angelo Becciu made the remarks to the Vatican's official newspaper six days after the pope's butler was arrested for leaking the papers. Paolo Gabriele, 46, was arrested Wednesday on accusations of illegal possession of confidential documents, the Vatican said in a statement issued three days after the arrest. With the leaks, the pope's very ministry ""has come under attack,"" Becciu said. The pope himself referred briefly to the scandal at the end of his regular Wednesday audience, his first public remarks on the matter. He criticized reports about the affair as ""entirely gratuitous"" and presenting ""a completely unrealistic image of the Holy See."" But experts say that exactly the opposite may be the truth, and that the arrest, alongside the firing of the head of the Vatican Bank a day later, may reveal the battle going on behind the scenes at the Vatican. The two events are bad PR for the top hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, but they may be more than that, experts say. They could affect who becomes the next pope. The effect of each one is the same: to weaken the authority of Pope Benedict XVI's second in command. Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, is involved in a power struggle with his predecessor, experts say. ""The reason for this fight is that the secretary of state will have a strong influence over the next conclave which will choose the next pope,"" said Giacomo Galeazzi, a journalist at the Italian daily La Stampa. The late John Paul II's secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, is trying to sideline Bertone and put one of his own proeteges in place before Benedict dies, Galeazzi said. ""The leaks will end when Bertone is out as secretary of state,"" he predicted. He said he expects that Bertone, who will be 78 in December, would be replaced at the end of the year, but not by the cardinal Sodano wants. Sodano, who is now the dean of the College of Cardinals, isn't the only one who doesn't like Bertone, said the Rev. Thomas Reese, author of ""Inside the Vatican."" When he became Vatican Secretary of State, Bertone ""did what normally happens. He brought in his team, the people he likes, the people he trusts, and he put them in key positions in the Vatican,"" Reese said. ""There are people who had hitched their star to the previous secretary of state who thought by now they would become an archbishop or a cardinal, and they didn't,"" Reese said. ""These people are unhappy and don't like Bertone."" Part of the reason for the butler and bank scandals is that the Vatican hasn't been run well in decades, Reese said. ""Clerics don't go to Harvard Business School. Bertone is a theologian. He doesn't have an MBA,"" he said. And Benedict is no better, he said. ""He is a German professor. He's a person who is into ideas, not a manager, and yet he is running a 1.2-billion member organization,"" Reese said. There's a faction within the Vatican that wants the next pope to be ""a better manger who can get the shop in order,"" Reese said. ""A lot of people think that would be an Italian, of course,"" after two popes from outside of Italy, John Paul II from Poland and Benedict from Germany, he said. But the undermining of Bertone may work against that faction, he said. ""Bertone is from the Vatican and is Italian,"" Reese pointed out. ""People may say we need somebody from outside who can come in and knock heads together and make it work."" Reese isn't taking a position on where the next pope should be from, but he has strong views on what Benedict's successor should do: ""The place really needs to be restructured and reorganized. It still operates in many ways like a 19th century European court."" CNN's Hada Messia and journalist Livia Borghese contributed to this report.","The leak of private papers is ""immoral"" and ""despicable,"" a top archbishop says .

"(CNN) -- This week India staged another phony protest. Political parties forced shops to shutter nationwide to object to a government policy allowing international retail giants greater participation in the world's second most populous country. They were outraged on behalf of small shopkeepers. Indian shopkeepers protest government plan for retail . However, for many mom-and-pop shops run in pokey back alleys and on street corners it was a case of ""more business than usual."" India's small neighbourhood stores beavered away as always -- delivering much needed groceries home for free - even as the rest of the nation put up a brave fight anticipating the demise of these shops. India's army of small-retailers, it seems, sensed no such threat. The shopping culture they share with millions of Indian shoppers is a hard one for big retailers to replicate. Most of the country's small shops start life as rough makeshift spaces that grow into permanent outposts keeping pace with the demands of the community. They mushroom everywhere - in pockets rich and poor, urban and rural, uptown and downtown - stocking goods entirely to reflect the needs of the community they serve. The locals, who shop in equal measure for gossip and goods, often drop by for small purchases that can be as obscure as a bar of soap or a box of matchsticks. The friendly neighbourhood storekeeper, for those unwilling to bear the trip or the gossip, will also readily deliver such small purchases home, at no extra fee, as many times a day as he is called upon to -- perhaps the biggest reason why Indian households remember their grocery needs only from one day to another. For a majority of small shopkeepers, no order is too small and no house too far. In India, consumers who shop at these stores aren't looking for the usual supermarket experience. Customers flocking to corner-shops typically buy goods they need for a limited period and for a limited value. Groceries are felt, smelt and recommended before any actual purchase is made. It's among few markets in the world where most groceries are still available unlabeled and un-packaged and can be bought in any quantity, however small or large. Oftentimes, goods are bought on credit with the only one collateral -- trust. And many a time, goods are returned -- without any proof of a bill. Try that at Walmart or Tesco. The biggest challenge for big retail, hoping to dent the business of small shopkeepers though, is familiarity. Not only do most small shopkeepers know their customers by name, they can also be relied upon for remembering individual grocery-buying patterns; brand by brand, category by category. It's a given that, even during the busiest periods, the local shopkeeper will remind the customer of things they haven't bought in a while. In short, the one-man retailer uses grocery records stored in his memory, far more interactively that a smart phone or the supermarket till ever will. To the neighborhood shopper then, the small shopkeeper is an extension of their household. To be fair, the entry of organized retail in the last few years has led to a different shopping experience for India's middle class. It's opened up an aspirational type of shopping, in sanitized environments with well-stocked shelves and everything from clothes to candy under one roof. Still, according to various industry estimates, such retail accounts for only some 7 percent of India's $450 billion retail market. So far, no large Indian supermarket chain has managed to replicate the convenience-store format successfully, because it's tough to offer goods on credit, personalize the service and stay profitable. Small retailers, who employ workers from the unorganized labour force, are estimated to extract three times the productivity of a uniformed employee at a supermarket. It's even tougher for big-ticket retailers to squeeze margins on small quantities of goods to serve the whimsical needs of each neighborhood. It's then hard to imagine how the world's biggest retailers will wipe out the small mom-and-pop stores, which work to an organized chaos that few inventory-keeping systems can mimic. India's small-retailers, unlike its deluded political class, realize that there is room for everyone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anjana Menon.","It was ""more business than usual"" for India's shopkeepers this week, says Anjana Menon .

"(CNN) -- Gay rights activists are planning to hold on Friday a ""national same-sex kiss day at Chick-fil-A,"" the restaurant chain whose president's opposition to same-sex marriage sparked a media frenzy. ""Let's show Chick-fil-A thanks for their support of Love, Equality, and the Real Definition of Marriage!"" organizers posted on their Facebook page.

The controversy started after an interview with Cathy appeared in The Baptist Press on July 16. He weighed in with his views on family. ""We are very much supportive of the family -- the biblical definition of the family unit,"" Cathy said. ""We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that.""

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick as Real Madrid took control of the Champions League ""Group of Death"" with a 4-1 rout of Ajax in Amsterdam Wednesday. It was their second successive win in Group D to lead the way from Borussia Dortmund, who have four points after they drew 1-1 at Manchester City. Ronaldo warmed up for the Clasico clash with Barcelona at the weekend by with some expert finishing, converting Karim Benzema's cross for the opener just before the break. Benzema added a second in the 48th minute with a superb overhead kick before Dutch champions Ajax cut the lead on 56 minutes when Niklas Moisander headed home. But Ronaldo curled home a third in the 79th minute and then completed his first hat-trick in the competition -- his second in a week -- with an impudent chip. English champions Manchester City looked set for their second straight defeat in the competition when they trailed 1-0 to Dortmund late in the game at the Etihad Stadium. But Sergio Aguero's hooked shot hit Neven Subotic's outstretched arm and a hotly disputed penalty was given. Mario Balotelli scored in his customary casual style from the spot to salvage a point for Roberto Mancini's men. They had trailed to a fine goal by Marco Reus on the hour mark and it took a string of incredible saves from England goalkeeper Joe Hart and a glaring miss from Robert Lewandowski to deny the German champions a deserved win. ""I think that Joe saved us. He did very, very well,"" Mancini told Sky Sports after the match. ""Today we deserved to concede three or four goals. We didn't play well. We didn't play well because Borussia Dortmund played better than us. Real's Spanish counterparts Malaga also continued their impressive introduction to the Champions League by winning 3-0 at Anderlecht to top Group C. Eliseu scored twice and Joaquin converted a first half penalty as they dominated in Belgium for a second straight victory in the group. Earlier, AC Milan won a dramatic five-goal encounter in St Petersburg against Zenit. An own goal by Tomas Hubocan gave the Italian giants victory after they had been pegged back, having taken a two-goal lead. Urby Emanuelson with a deflected free kick and Stephan El Shaarawy scored for the visitors in the space of three minutes. But the home side hit back and after a string of superb saves by Milan goalkeeper Christian Abbiati, Brazilian Hulk reduced the deficit just before halftime. Roman Shirokov headed home Hulk's corner to level just after the break but Hubocan helped home a weak effort by Giampaolo Pazzini to leave his team pointless after two games. While Manchester City struggled, their EPL rivals Arsenal made it two wins from two in Group B with a 3-1 home victory over Olympiakos of Greece. Gervinho continued his recent scoring run with the opener for the Gunners, but Kostas Mitroglou glanced home an equalizer before halftime. Lukas Podolski put Arsenal back ahead in the 56th minute before Aaron Ramsey rounded off the victory in injury time. Schalke were denied their second win in the group as 10-man Montpellier scored a 90th-minute equalizer. Striker Souleymane Camara stuck in the 90th minute to earn a 2-2 draw for the French visitors. Karim Ait-Fana had put them ahead early on before the Royal Blues hit back through teenager Julia Draxler. Schalke looked headed for victory as Garry Bocaly fouled Draxler in the penalty area and was shown a red card in conceding the spot kick. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar converted the penalty before Montpellier leveled through Camara's curling shot. In Group A, an 83rd-minute goal by James Rodriguez gave  Porto a 1-0 home win over big spending Paris Saint-Germain. The result leaves Porto three points clear of PSG, who are tied on three points with Dynamo Kiev after the Ukrainians beat Dinamo Zagreb 2-0.","Real Madrid top ""Group of Death"" after 4-1 win at Ajax .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea continued to set the pace in the English Premier League with a comfortable 4-1 win over Norwich City at Stamford Bridge Saturday. Norwich took an unlikely 11th minute lead through their star striker Grant Holt, but it was to prove short lived once the west London side got into their stride. Goals from Fernando Torres, his 99th in English football, Frank Lampard and Eden Hazard put them 3-1 ahead by half time. Branislav Ivanovic rounded off the scoring with an emphatic fourth in the 78th minute. Both John Terry and Ashley Cole played and were given a warm reception by the home crowd. Cole was forced to apologize Friday for a controversial Twitter comment as he reacted to the findings of an FA commission into the racial slur case brought against Terry. The commission found Terry's evidence at the hearing ""improbable, implausible and contrived"" as they gave the reasons for his four-match ban and large fine for remarks aimed at QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in an EPL game last season. He has until October 18 to appeal the decision or accept a ban which would rule him out of crucial games. Manager Roberto Di Matteo confirmed after the game that Cole was likely to face action from the club over his tweet. ""We've got a social media policy at the club and there's going to be a disciplinary process against the tweet and that's how I'll leave it,"" Di Matteo said. Chelsea have opened up a four-point lead over defendiing champions Manchester City, while Norwich are winless in the league this season. Earlier Saturday, City accounted for Sunderland 3-0 at the Etihad Stadium, set on their way by a first half strike from Aleksandar Kolarov. But with the visitors showing signs of getting back into the match, manager Roberto Mancini substituted Mario Balotelli, who looked disgruntled, with Sergio Aguero. The hero of City's last-gasp title success did not take long to make his mark, connecting with a cross to make it 2-0. James Milner added a late goal for City, who were held 1-1 in midweek in the Champions League by Borussia Dortmund and were winning for just the second time in seven games in all competitions. In the late kickoff, Arsenal stepped up their challenge with a 3-1 win at West Ham. Mohamed Diame gave West Ham the first half lead but French striker Olivier Giroud scored to level just before halftime for the Gunners. Theo Walcott came on to put Arsenal ahead in the second half before Santi Cazorla completed the win late on to lift his side into fifth place.","Chelsea beat Norwich 4-1 at Stamford Bridge .

"(CNN) -- Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos was at home Saturday after leaving a hospital where he underwent surgery for prostate cancer this week. ""A million thanks to everyone for their support and solidarity,"" the president wrote on his official Twitter page. On Monday, Santos announced that he had prostate cancer, but described the tumor as ""small"" and ""not aggressive."" He underwent surgery Wednesday at a hospital in Bogota, Colombia's capital. Upon leaving the hospital, Santos spoke to reporters, according to CNN affiliate Caracol. The 61-year-old president said the tumor had not metastasized. ""In other words, I'm totally cured,"" Santos said. The news comes about one week before the government is expected to start peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as the FARC.

"New York (CNN) -- A 15-year-old girl goes to the clinic in her New York high school -- perhaps confused, perhaps unprepared, perhaps scared that she may become pregnant. There she might get not only answers but the ""morning-after,"" or Plan B, pill -- and not necessarily with her parent's direct consent. That can happen thanks to the city's pregnancy-prevention program dubbed Connecting Adolescents To Comprehensive Healthcare, best known by its acronym CATCH. Its aim is to do something about the more than 7,000 girls 17 or younger who get pregnant in New York City annually, with 90% of those pregnancies unplanned, according to the city's health department. ""We are committed to trying new approaches ... to improve a situation that can have negative consequences that last a lifetime,"" the health department said in a statement. Study: Teen access to Plan B uneven . The program, which also allows for the distribution of condoms and birth control pills, began in January 2011. But it has gotten more attention of late, with most of it about the Plan B pill. The FDA says the pill can be taken after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy, either by stopping the release of a female's egg, stopping sperm from fertilizing an egg or preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the womb. Its purpose is to prevent a pregnancy, not to end one. Some city dwellers have praised the program, calling it a helpful tool to curb teen pregnancy. Others, though, feel that it is a misguided and possibly dangerous intrusion into the lives of families and the authority of parents. Mona Davids, the president of the recently formed New York City Parents Union, is firmly in the latter camp. She believes the city's department of education and Mayor Michael Bloomberg ""have completely overstepped their bounds"" by potentially affecting a child's health without their parents' direct knowledge. ""What you're doing is you're giving a young child, between the age of 14 and 17, a chemical drug and hormonal cocktail without the knowledge of the parent, not knowing the medical history or if that child has any kind of drug allergies,"" Davids told HLN's ""Evening Express,"" noting teens can't get an aspirin in school ""without informed consent"" but could get the morning-after pill. In New York, a person must be 18 or older to buy the pill over the counter. Those younger than 18 must have a prescription. The program, which began in five schools and recently expanded to 13, is not mandatory. Parents can ""opt out"" by signing and returning a form to the school. The health department said recently, though, that only 1% to 2% of parents have done so. Yet Davids, who has a teenage girl and a young boy, said, ""Most parents I've spoken to"" in schools involved in the program never got a letter from the city's health or education departments, thus never opted out of the program. She's not surprised, claiming that the city school system has long had ""very poor outreach to parents."" Still, some city residents -- parents and nonparents alike -- disagree with Davids. At a time when half of teen mothers never graduate high school and 47% of U.S. high schoolers say they are sexually active, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, they say that the more options teens have, the better. ""Kids are having kids, and that's the end of their education,"" said Frances Mejias, who said she wishes her daughter's high school had the program. ""Once you have a kid, that's the end of it, let's be honest."" Another woman, Holly Macke, said the program was ""not good, but it's OK"" -- especially if the alternative is a teenager having an illegal and possibly dangerous abortion after getting pregnant. ""I think kids are going to get into trouble, so the least the school can (do is) help them out some,"" Macke said. One New Yorker who strongly supports the program -- which, so far, has led to more than 1,100 students receiving birth control pills, including Plan B, according to the health department -- is its mayor. Asked about the program that went on quietly for an entire school year before receiving media attention, Bloomberg told reporters that the program is ""nothing new"" and noted it was a pilot program. He pointed to progress in the city in lowering teen pregnancy rates, which he claims are down 25% in the past decade. But the mayor said lowering those rates even further is important, given the personal and academic costs of teen pregnancy. ""There (are) still an awful lot of girls who get pregnant at a very early age, when history shows its very difficult to raise a child and give the child the care it needs when the parent just is very young and hasn't had the experience of adulthood,"" Bloomberg said. Beyond that, the mayor said he was surprised that a program that's been running quietly for nearly two full years was all of a sudden a source of controversy. ""We've been doing this for a long time,"" he said. ""There just isn't any big news story.""","Fresh attention is focused on New York program aimed at preventing teen pregnancy .
