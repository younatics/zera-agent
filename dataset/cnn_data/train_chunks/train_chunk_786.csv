"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . At a time of national wage stagnation and economic uncertainty outside the beltway, a Virginia Democratic congressman wants a raise – arguing that a $174,000 salary isn't enough for a federal legislator to live comfortably in or around Washington, D.C. 'I think the American people should know that the members of Congress are underpaid,' Moran told Roll Call. 'I understand that it’s widely felt that they underperform, but the fact is that this is the board of directors for the largest economic entity in the world.' Congress' approval rating among voters typically hovers under 20 per cent. Rep. Jim Moran, a 23-year incumbent, is set to retire next year but wants to leave congressional salaries on the upswing when he departs . Frugal: House Speaker John Boehner shares a basement apartment near Capitol Hill with a roommate, stretching his big-enough salary so he can support his household in Ohio . As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Moran participated in a subcommittee's legislative 'markup' session Thursday that will affect how much money the Treasury sets aside for congressional salaries. Overall, the House aims to set aside a whopping $3.3 billion to run its operations, including expenses for Member and staff salaries, constituent support services and operating office buildings near the Capitol. Republicans on the committee want Moran's pay – and their own – to remain at the level where they've been held since a austerity freeze took effect in 2010. Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, insisted that there would be no salary bump in the House of Representatives. 'The House will continue to lead by example and hold the line on spending,' he said Thursday. A Republican aide to an appropriations Committee member told MailOnline that Moran's request is out of line with reality. 'This is how the Democrats work,' he said. 'They come to town and all of a sudden feel entitled to spend more and more taxpayer dollars, even on themselves. If anything, members should be cutting their salaries until the unemployment picture in the rest of America improves. Don't you think?' Moran whined to Roll Call that 'our pay has been frozen for three years and we’re planning on freezing it a fourth year. … A lot of members can’t even afford to live decently in Washington.' He said his proposal for bigger paychecks probably won't gain any traction in committee – 'this is wholly quixotic,' he admitted – but added that he might raise the issue on the House floor in order to start a broader discussion. Shutdown couture: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (L) wore a pricey Hermes scarf on television in October, while arguing against a looking partial government shutdown . Moran is retiring next year after 12 terms in Washington, a job he won after serving as the mayor of Alexandria, Virginia. He describes himself as the poorest member of Congress. A 2010 divorce left Moran virtually penniless after several previous years' financial disclosures showed he had millions banked – $12.7 million, in fact, as recently as 2007, according to a Washington Post database.. Some of his colleagues, however, have managed to squeak by on their modest $174,000 salaries. House Speaker John Boehner shares a basement apartment with a roommate when he's not in his southern Ohio district, for example. Others, though, haev managed to become wealthy while listing public services as their official careers. Nancy Pelosi, the one-time House speaker who is now Democrats' minority leader, is part of America's financial '1 per cent.' Her financial disclosure form filed last year shows assets worth at least $38 million. Due to the form's vague categories, those assets could be worth as much as $178 million. In 1995 when she filed her first congressional disclosure, she listed assets worth about half as much. Pelosi's 'shutdown couture' raised national eyebrows in October when she sported a designer Hermes scarf worth nearly $1,000 while arguing that the federal government couldn't afford to close down while Congress debated the 2014 federal budget. Originally, serving in Congress was a part-time avocation for farmers, ranchers, lawyers and homesteaders who spent most of their time at home and collected $6 per day for their service. Today the suburbs around the nation's capital are home to America's wealthiest ZIP codes and hold the distinction of being one of the few places where unemployment rates are declining.","Congressman Jim Moran, a Virginia Democrat, thinks federal legislators are underpaid .
Zip codes around Washington, D.C. have the nation's highest average household incomes, and housing prices have tracks along with salaries .
With many Americans struggling to make ends meet and U.S. employment participation rate at a 20-year low, a pay raise request sounds callous .
Republicans are insisting on continuing a pay freeze for members of Congress that dates back to 2010 ."
"By . Jessica Jerreat . A San Diego couple's dream to sail around the world with their two young daughters got off to a stormy start just two weeks into the voyage. The Coast Guard had to come to the aid of Eric and Charlotte Kaufman after their daughter fell seriously sick just as their sailboat became stranded. The couple and their children Lyra, 1, and Dora, 3, were rescued about 900 nautical miles off the Mexican coast a fortnight after they set sail from California in their 36ft yacht, Rebel Heart. Rough seas: Eric and Charlotte Kaufman with their daughters Lyra, left, and Cora, before they set sail . Adventure: The lure of South Pacific islands encouraged Eric to set sail with his wife and two young daughters . For years the couple, who are experienced sailors, had dreamed of sailing to remote islands in the South Pacific on the boat they bought in 2005. On their blog - The Rebel Heart - they wrote of excitedly waiting on March 20 for the right conditions before setting sail on the well-stocked boat. With a toddler just learning to walk, and a curious three-year-old on board, the couple knew their voyage wouldn't all be plain sailing, but they could never have predicted that they would be calling for help so quickly. In her early blog posts about the voyage Mrs Kaufman, a teacher and owner of an Etsy baby boutique, wrote about trying to keep a constant watch on their girls, as she coped with seasickness. As well as needing space to keep their children entertained, the couple have filled the boat with supplies of cans, dried good, diapers and fresh food. Off course: The family set sail from San Diego on March 20 but had to call for help on April 3, 900 nautical miles of Mexico . Home from home: The family planned to sail around the world on Rebel Heart, a 36ft boat . Sick bay: Charlotte and Lyra, who suffered a fever and sickness while out to sea . But despite choppy conditions, the family were relishing their adventure, singing and laughing in the cabin, and showering on deck as their boat glided through the Pacific. Day One  I can see the magic of being out to sea, but I can’t really taste it. Our children keep us too grounded to enjoy the esoterics of salty breezes, gigantic swells undulating around your boat like an erotic hula dancer, and a night sky dancing with laser beams of brilliance. Day Two Our foresail, stay sail, and main sail, hold fast, all strong and white, like our painted wooden mast, and I can feel their excitement to be used like this again; they were made for blue-water sailing, and apparently, so were we. Day Four Today started out sh**** too. It is so hard to keep a positive outlook at sea when you feel awful. Day Six I can’t possibly describe the range of emotions I have felt so far: anger, joy, sickness, exhaustion, exhilaration, wonder, awe, contentment, peace . Day Eight I think this may be the stupidest thing we have ever done ... [but] not everyone gets to realize their dreams in life. Day Eleven When I woke up this morning my back muscles were tight from the constant rocking you can’t escape at night. Day Thirteen Thirteen days at sea ... We are in good spirits, as good as you can be, considering. Three days later the family contacted the Coast Guard for help . On the second day of their voyage, Mrs Kaufman wrote: 'It is simple things that excite a crew when out to sea ... like the turtle calmly paddling in the opposite direction as us.' She also described how she and her husband, who works for a financial services company, gave each other fist bumps when they first realized they could no longer see land in any direction. But the exotic and remote South Pacific islands where they were headed must have seemed like a distant dream when their youngest daughter fell sick. The romance of life at sea was replaced with a longing for modern appliances like washing machines that other families rely so heavily on. In one blog post, Mrs Kaufman wrote: 'I think this may be the stupidest thing we have ever done,' as she described the difficulty of trying to hand wash poopy diapers. The biggest trial came when Lyra suffered illness for several days, resulting in the family calling for help from the Coast Guard. On Thursday night a four-member team . from the California Air National Guard parachuted into the sea and got . Lyra the medical treatment she needed, the UT San Diego reported. The . boat, which had been stranded in dead water, has also been repaired and . is heading back to shore at Cabo San Lucas to give the family time to . regroup. It is not the . first time the couple have had to rechart their planned course across . the South Pacific. They have been slowly circumnavigating the world since buying their boat in 2005 and attempted a different section of the voyage when Mrs Kaufman was pregnant with their second . child. Dream voyage: The family have had to cut short their planned trip across the South Pacific . Back on dry land: The family are heading back to shore after suffering sickness and boat problems . However, a combination of morning sickness, sea sickness and a toddler in tow meant Mrs Kaufman returned to shore. As she wrote about the experiences in San Diego Magazine, she mused on how pleased she was to have returned to dry land, after suffering a couple of pregnancy complications which would have been difficult to handle out to sea. It is not clear if the family will try to embark on their South Pacific adventure again, but the lure of far-flung islands is bound to have them longing for the open ocean before long.","Couple were headed to the South Pacific with their children, aged 1 and 3 .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Vogue magazine has sparked international outrage after publishing a photograph of a 'beaten-up' model. The image, in this month's edition of Vogue Italia, was an attempt at making a political statement against domestic violence, the publication claimed. But critics have blasted the fashion shoot for 'glamourising' violence against women. Outrage: This image of a woman bleeding and strewn across the floor in Vogue Italia has enraged readers . The photograph shows a model in a Prada dress sprawled upside down at the bottom of a flight of stairs, blood streaming into her hair, as a blood-splattered man looks on from an armchair. Other images in the violence-themed edition show a girl in a Prada dress screaming as a man approaches her with blood on his hands. Another girl hides in a cupboard, with a man leaning over brandishing shears. And in one, the model looks petrified crouching under the stairs as a man descends. Outraged Twitter users attacked the 'poor taste' shoot. One user wrote: 'Vogue Italia is repulsively glamourising domestic violence. It makes me very angry.' Twitter users blasted the use of couture in the photo shoot where girls scream as a man approaches . Critics advised Vogue editors to meet victims of violence before publishing a violence-themed edition . Another said: 'God. Terrible. I can't quite believe we're seeing it.' One said: 'There is nothing glamorous about domestic violence. Anyone who thinks there is need to speak to victims simple.' One simply wrote: 'Unacceptable'. Anticipating the outrage, editor-in-chief Franca Sozzani, wrote: 'It doesn't matter if we run the risk of causing a general uproar with the media or arousing criticism; or if we are accused of exploiting pressing issues just to push our way in newsstands. 'What is important for us is that at least one of the dozens of women suffering violence every day can feel our nearness. Political statement: In a forward, editor-in-chief Franca Sozzani, pictured with Courtney Love, defended the edition as a political statement in support of women who have been subjected to domestic abuse . 'And that those who follow us may feel stimulated to take action, condemn, and support women in trouble. 'And that they all see that all of us at ""Vogue Italia"" are on their side: by utterly and radically condemning all types of violence. This awareness urges us to make some noise. In our own way.' It is not the first time Ms Sozzani has courted controversy in her tenure as Vogue Italia editor. She was the first magazine editor to produce an edition featuring only black models, and later sparked outrage by labelling large gold hoops 'slave earrings'.","Images show models covered in blood and screaming as man advances .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . An array of colours, from pinks to blues and oranges, fill the night sky to create an amazing collection of interstellar patterns. Captured up to 20 million light-years away, this is stargazing at its best. But these incredible images weren't taken by a deep-space probe, they were snapped by sales manager Terry Hancock, 60, from the comfort of his back garden. Stunning: Terry Hancock's incredible images, including the Rosette Nebula seen here, were captured in his back garden in Michigan, US . Galaxies like Messier 81, also known as Bode's Galaxy, are revealed in stunning detail by Hancock's photos . He was able to capture the astounding images from his back garden in Michigan, US with the help of two CCD cameras, a QHY9M and a QHY11S. 'My astronomy photographs all show deep sky objects, many of them thousands or millions of light years away from Earth,' says Terry, originally from Burnley, Lancashire. 'The wonders of our universe are infinite. Hancock used his own camera, telescope, mount and laptop to capture cosmic marvels such as the Pleiades cluster 460 light-years away . 'The idea of gazing up into the night sky and being able to capture these beautiful clusters, nebulae and galaxies thousands to many millions of light years away really fascinates me. 'The night sky is a virtual time machine that existed way before mankind existed, which I just find amazing.' Capturing scenes from 5,000 to 20 million light years away, Terry only needs a digital camera, a telescope, a German equatorial mount (an object used to follow the rotation of the sky) and a laptop. It took Hancock up to an hour to process each image, including the Orion and Horsehead nebulas, approximately 1,500 light-years from Earth, seen here . Hancock's image of the Bubble Nebula, up to 11,000 light-years away, shows the fascinating 'bubble' emission originating from a young central star in the nebula . Despite being 2.5 million light-years away, Hancock's photograph brings the Andromeda Galaxy to life . The Whirlpool Galaxy (left) and The Eagle Nebula (right) are both revealed in stunning detail in Hancock's images . Located 7000 light-years away, towards the constellation of Serpens .

The . powerful light and strong winds from these new arrivals are . shaping light-year long pillars, seen in images partly silhouetted . against the bright background of the nebula. The nebula itself has a . shape vaguely reminiscent of an eagle, with the central pillars representing the talons of the bird. The 'Pillars of Creation' are . in the middle of the nebula, with a cluster of young stars called NGC 6611 lying nearby. Finger-like . features protrude from the vast cloud wall of cold gas . and dust, not unlike stalagmites rising from the floor of a cave. Inside . the pillars, the gas is dense enough to collapse under its own . weight, forming young stars. Terry explains: 'The majority of my images consist of 10 minute to hour-long exposures and combined exposures of between 10 and 40 hours long. 'A DSLR camera is hooked up to a telescope which is essentially a giant telephoto lens. 'This telescope along with other equipment is connected to an equatorial mount, instead of a tripod, and it follows the target across the sky as the earth rotates. 'At the end of a project each exposure is combined to equal the total exposure time and then stacked together to create one single image. 'I get a lot of brilliant reactions from the public, from sheer amazement to non-belief.

Michael Mandell says that his best friend Tyler Hadley's murderous actions ruined his life . Mandell grew up one block away from Tyler Hadley and they became instant friends. 'I was just walking around, looking for friends, and I met Tyler … He slowly became my best friend, Mandell said. Tyler Hadley's aunt Cindy hadley also spoke with ABC and said that by the time Tyler had turned 15, they started seeing a change in him. 'He started skipping school, hanging out with the wrong crowd, getting on drugs,' Tyler Hadley’s aunt, Cindy Hadley, told “20/20.” 'We knew marijuana.' When Tyler Hadley turned 17, his parents did everything they could try try to help him including getting him a psychiatrist, antidepressants, and a substance abuse program. One week before the party, Mandell says Tyler came home drunk so his parents took away his cell phone as a punishment. Mandell took this selfie with his friend Tyler after seeing his parents bodies because he knew it would be the last time he ever saw his friend again .

Mandell said even though his friend said he'd kill his parents he didn't actually believe he would do it. 'It sounded like he was mad he was getting punished,' he said. During the party Mandell said his friend made a confession that at first he didn't believe was true. 'He says, ""Mike, I killed my parents."" And I said, ""No you didn't, Tyler. Shut up. What are you talking about?""' Mandell said. 'And, he said, ""Mike ... look at the driveway, all the cars are there. My parents aren’t in Orlando. I killed my parents.""' Mandell saw blood by the door of the parents' master bedroom and on the computer desk but he thought his friend was playing a prank on him. 'I took Tyler into the garage, and I said, ""What's going on here? I want to see them dead, if you really did it. I don't believe you,""' Mandell said. Hadley wanted to wait until the party died down to show his friend the proof but Mandell refused to wait. 'I come up to the [master bedroom] door. The party's going on over here, and I turn the door knob,' Mandell said. 'I looked down, and I [saw] his father's leg against the door … My eyes popped up, and I said, ""Oh my, he's telling the truth. He did it. This is real.""' Mandell told reporters that he stayed at the party for a few more hours after his friend told him that he killed his parents in order to support his troubled friend. 'If you were in my shoes, and that guy was your best friend, you wouldn't want [to] leave right away,' Mandell said. 'I know how heinous and sick this is, you know, what he did. But, you ... wouldn't have ran away, because you're comfortable with this guy. You don't see him as a killer.' Sentenced: Tyler Hadley, who murdered his parents, walks from the courtroom after being sentenced to life in prison without parole at the St. Lucie County Courthouse in Florida on Thursday March 20 . Mandell took a selfie with Hadley, . which received a lot of criticism from people saying he didn't take the crime seriously, but he said he took the photo because he knew it was . the last time he'd ever see his friend. 'I knew it was going to . be the last time I ever [saw] him,' said Mandell who left the party . hours later and called Crime Stoppers to report his friend's murder. 'You . know, I didn't have any hesitation whatsoever for calling the cops,' Mandell said. 'The … worst feeling had to have been realizing ...that . his parents are gone.' Hadley, who was just 17 when he brutally . beat his parents to death before throwing a party with their bodies . still inside the house has been sentenced to life without parole on March 20, 2014. Tyler Hadley beat his . parents, Mary Jo and Blake Hadley, to death with a hammer at their St . Lucie, Florida home in 2011, then spent three hours clearing up their . blood so he could have a party. In . February, Hadley pleaded no contest in February to two counts of . first-degree murder and on Friday Judge Robert R. Makemson handed Hadley . two life sentences. He branded the crime brutal, heinous and premeditated. Hadley's attorney had argued for two 30-year sentences, to be served concurrently, with a review after 20 years. Hadley couldn't receive a death sentence because he was 17 at the time of the killings. A fellow inmate has said Hadley signs autographs and refers to himself as 'hammer boy' behind bars. After the shocking crime, a friend of Hadely's, Markey Philips, recounted that two weeks before the horrific murders, the teen had seemed withdrawn when they hung out at his home. In court: Circuit Judge Robert Makemson called the crime brutal, heinous and premeditated . Stress: Ryan Hadley, who'd previously called his brother a 'pathological liar', listens to the verdict . Emotional: Family members exit the court after Hadley was given two life sentences . Hadley, who had been in trouble with the law in the past for arson and was a known drug taker and underage drinker, told mandell that he 'wanted to kill his parents and have a big party after' - because nobody had ever done that before. As Mandell told, ABC, he didn't take Hadley seriously. On the morning of the killings, Hadley was asked by a friend if the party he had been bragging about all week was still on and if he was going to kill his parents, to which he reponded: 'no but im gonna.' He took three ecstasy pills and used a claw hammer to murder his parents, authorities said. That night, about 60 people gathered for a party at the family's Fort Pierce home, playing beer pong, smoking cigars and drinking while the victims' bodies were locked in their bedroom. Friends described Hadley as being in a . good mood and hospitable during the party. One friend said Hadley had . planned to hold a second bash the following night. Victims: Mary Jo and Blake Hadley were beaten to death and locked in their room as their son partied . Plan: Hadley locked his parents' bodies in their bedroom then threw a party for 60 people downstairs . Word of the killings eventually made its way around the party, police said. Mandell's call to police lead to Hadley's arrest early the next morning. Hadley told a friend interviewed by police that his father had punched him in the face several times, according to investigative files previously released by prosecutors. But a fellow inmate said Hadley told him . he'd never been beaten or molested, the files stated, and the man's . brother, Ryan Hadley, called his parents 'awesome' and said his brother . was a 'pathological liar.' Scene: Hadley told a friend about the killing and word spread around the party before the police were called . Stains: Hadley told an inmate that he knew his parents loved him because they didn't try to stop him . Evidence seized from the home hinted at some mental problems for the defendant, including a receipt for a mental health center and a bottle of an antidepressant medication, authorities said. An inmate, Justin Toney, said that Hadley was famous throughout the prison and had signed autographs. He said Hadley knew he had 'shocked the world' and realised something about his parents as he allegedly attacked them with a hammer. 'I said, ""Did they try to stop you?""' Toney asked about the attack. 'And he was like, ""No, that's how I knew that they really loved me.""'","'It ruined my life. It ruined Tyler's life. It ended his parents' life,'  the best friend of Tyler Hadley, Michael Mandell, 20, said .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press . The White House has voiced their disapproval after Samsung promoted a selfie with the president taken by a Boston Red Sox star while using a Samsung phone. Designated hitter David 'Big Papi' Ortiz snapped the photo during an April 1 visit to the White House with his teammates as President Obama congratulated them for winning the 2013 World Series and posted it to Twitter. 'What an honor, thanks for the selfie,' Ortiz wrote with the picture. It was soon retweeted by Samsung with the added comment 'Big Papi, Big Selfie' in a move that drew the ire of White House officials. Scroll down for video . 'Big Papi, Big Selfie': The Red Sox slugger's picture with the president . drew the ire of administration officials after Samsung retweeted it in . what appeared to be a promotion . 'I can say that as a rule, the White House objects to attempts to use the president's likeness for commercial purposes,' Spokesman Jay Carney said during a Thursday media briefing. 'And we certainly object in this case.' Carney didn't say whether the White House has asked Samsung to stop using the image. Ortiz tweeted the picture of him with President Barack Obama to followers Tuesday after appearing to have been cajoled into the photo op after Obama said 'alright come on, let's get a good picture here,' according to CNN Money. It has been retweeted by almost 42,000 people and favorited by another 48,000 in the days since. Samsung retweeted the photo in an ad that has garnered fairly paltry numbers of engagement - only 510 retweets and 639 favorites. The company also tweeted that the photo was taken with a Samsung phone.# . The phone maker's caption was a play on a well-known promotional video for an MLB-sponsored children's charity a few years ago. Major League Baseball shared the presidential pic and saw double the retweets and favorites Samsung has. Selfie: Boston Red Sox designated hitter David 'Big Papi' Ortiz takes a selfie with his Galaxy Note 3 with President Barack Obama, holding a Boston Red Sox jersey presented to him . Ortiz claimed to the Boston Globe that the moment was spontaneous. 'That was one of those things that just happened,' said the slugger. 'I gave him the jersey, and the photographers were going to take their pictures and I thought, really at the last second, maybe I should snap a shot with my phone while I have the chance.' Despite the three-time World Series champion signing an endorsement deal with Samsung a few months ago, he was adamant, 'it had nothing to do with no deals.' A Samsung spokesperson told the Globe . that it was 'thrilled to see the special, historic moment David Ortiz . captured with his Galaxy Note 3 during his White House visit.' The South Korean electronics giant also said that it 'worked with David and the team on how to share images with fans' upon learning of the White House visit. Carney insisted that Obama 'had no idea' the pic would be used in a promotion by Samsung. The company has a history of innovative promotions with selfies, including one with Ellen during the Oscars that is the most retweeted tweet of all-time. Officials have objected to use of the president's image in prior advertisements, but have no legal basis to do so.","Designated hitter David Ortiz appeared to spontaneously snap the picture with president Obama during a White House visit .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated  Press Reporter . Police officers performing a welfare check Monday discovered a legless corpse in a bathtub, a bloody chain saw in the kitchen and a plastic-wrapped human body inside a Las Vegas home where a man is accused of killing and dismembering his mother and sister, according to newly released court documents. Severed legs were later found in a freezer, and a store receipt for a chain saw and ear plugs turned up in a vehicle where suspect Darius Sorrells, 30, was arrested Saturday, the police report said. A North Las Vegas judge on Wednesday ordered Sorrells held without bail and gave prosecutors until April 9 to file criminal charges in the slayings of his mother, Janice Burden, 53, and sister Natasha Sorrells, 33. Grisly crime: Darius Davon Sorrells, 30, has been accused of killing both his mother and sister and dismembering one of the bodies with a chain saw in his sister's Las Vegas home . Victims: Natasha Sorrells, 33 (left), and her mother, Janice Burden, 53 (right), were found dead in their Las Vegas home Monday morning . The women were last heard from last week, and police visited the home twice — on Friday and Sunday — before finally entering through a broken back door and finding the house of horrors before dawn on Monday, North Las Vegas police Sgt. Chrissie Coon said. 'Multiple conversations we had with family and friends led us to put two and two together,' Coon said. A friend told police that Natasha Sorrells had recently awoken to find her brother standing over her holding a crow bar. He warned her to be careful around him, but the 33-year-old woman replied that she loved Darius and wanted to help him, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Neighbors and relatives told investigators that Darius Sorrells was mentally unstable. Sorrells declined to speak with investigators following his arrest, Coon said. He was expected to be appointed a public defender at his next court appearance. The police report said he showed no reaction when he was told he was under arrest in the deaths of his mother and sister. Police believe he killed the two women before beginning to dismember his sister's corpse in the bathtub. The Clark County coroner announced Thursday that Natasha Sorrells, whose body was found with severed legs, died from a head injury. The coroner hasn't said what killed the mother. Burden's body was found wrapped so tightly in layers of clear plastic and blue painter's tape that police who entered the modest two-story stucco home described it as a 'mummy.' Officers also found black vinyl gloves at the foot of the stairs, trash bags, an empty bottle of bleach and patches of ripped-out carpet. A bloody handprint was found on a bathtub wall, and decomposing flesh on the tile floor, the police report said. A trash can was in the middle of the living room; a green wheelbarrow next to the fireplace. One officer noted what appeared to be blood spray on couch cushions. House of horrors: Police who responded to Natasha Sorrells' home on the 6100 block of Stibor Street in North Las Vegas . walked in on a gruesome crime scene, with blood on the floor and a stench of decomposition mixed with incense smell hanging in the air . The chain saw was found disassembled on the kitchen counter, along with knives, screwdrivers and a drain plunger. Human blood was found on the saw blade and throughout the house, which was permeated with the smell of incense mingled with overwhelming stench. Police said home improvement store video showed Mr Sorrells buying the machine Friday morning. Coon said they last had contact with family members and friends last Wednesday or Thursday. She said police were informed Friday that the women were missing and hadn't been seen at work. Before police responded to the house early Monday morning, a family friend stopped by to check on Burden and Sorrells on behalf of their relatives, who haven’t heard from either woman for several days, according to Las Vegas Sun. After getting permission from Burden's other son, the friend kicked in the back door and entered the residence, where chaos reigned. Initially, the friend thought that a sewer pipe had burst, filling the home with stench and leaving the floors covered in a dark, sticky fluid. It later turned out to be blood. Sorrells is the only suspect in the slayings, Coon said. His arrest came after he was found about 3am Saturday driving a 2004 GMC Envoy erratically a couple of miles from the home. The vehicle sped away from a shopping center parking lot and at one point drove into oncoming traffic lanes before crashing into a light pole, police said. Coon said Sorrells fled on foot toward nearby railroad tracks before he was caught. The man told detectives that he had a memory loss of 'every event before his arrest.'","Darius Davon Sorrells, 30, is accused of killing both his mother and sister and dismembering one of the bodies .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Mother-of-four Tracey Askham, 47, was run over and crushed to death outside a supermarket after a fellow shopper had a violent coughing fit at the wheel of his car, an inquest heard today. The teacher was packing her groceries into her Mini Cooper at Morrisons in the village of Idle, near Bradford, West Yorkshire, when she was struck by a runaway 4x4 Suzuki Vitara. The car came to rest on top of her and she died of her injuries a week later in hospital. Tragic: Schoolteacher Tracey Askham, 47, was packing her groceries into her Mini Cooper at Morrisons in Idle, near Bradford, West Yorkshire, when she was hit by a runaway 4x4 Suzuki Vitara . The investigation into Mrs Askham’s death showed that the Suzuki driver Frank Sellers, 70, who suffers from a number of lung problems had momentarily lost control of his vehicle after suffering a sudden coughing fit as he drove through the car park at 9mph. His vehicle mounted a kerb before hitting Mrs Askham and her car – pushing the Mini back into the next parking space. Mrs Askham had taught business studies at the 1,200 pupil Church of England Immanuel College secondary school in Thackley since 2001 and was described by pupils and staff and friends as ‘inspirational’ and ‘a ‘beautiful woman inside and out’. After being freed Tracey Askham suffered a cardiac arrest on the way to Leeds General Infirmary. She went into a coma and died without regaining consciousness. Tests showed she died from bronco pneumonia . She was raising money to help build a school in Gambia and had also run a half marathon in memory of a former pupil who died of a heart ailment aged 21. She completed that challenge despite breaking both elbows during training. The inquest in Bradford, West Yorkshire, heard the tragedy occurred at 7pm on August 21 last year when Mrs Askham, who had been visiting friends, stopped at Morrisons to buy tea for her boyfriend Iain and son Jack. Eyewitness Steven Cunningham, a fork lift driver who was also shopping at the store, said: ‘I was walking back to the trolley park then I heard a bang and saw the four wheel drive car bouncing over the kerb area. ‘It just carried on travelling forward into the front of the Mini and I could see the lady standing there. When the four wheel drive hit the Mini, she just went down. ‘I ran over straightaway to see… the Mini still moving slightly and the four wheel drive was shoving the Mini back and the lady with it. Mrs Askham had taught business studies at the 1,200 pupil Church of England Immanuel College secondary school in Thackley since 2001 . ‘She was underneath the car and just her head stuck out the back. She was just calling for somebody to get the car off her. She was conscious at first. ‘I put my hands against the car to try and shove it and release some of the weight but there was nobody there to help. I ran back to where the trolley park was. I was like a headless chicken. ‘As I was at the back of the car the driver eventually appeared. I started saying ‘What have you done? You have run somebody over!’ There was nothing we could do.’ Mrs Askham was freed but suffered a cardiac arrest on the way to Leeds General Infirmary. She went into a coma and died without regaining consciousness. Tests showed she died from bronco pneumonia. The hearing was told Mr Sellers who passed a breath test at the scene had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His driving licence has been suspended since the crash. Sgt Carl Quinn of West Yorkshire Police said: ‘Mr Sellers had got a cough but it had not caused him any significant issues. ‘He started coughing violently. The next thing he remembered is being parked with his vehicle in collision with the mini. He suggests he had a loss of consciousness which was regained at the time when the collision took place. ‘He had never had an incident or loss of consciousness before due to coughing. He lost consciousness and travelled in a straight line. Mr Sellers said he had a cough for about three weeks. He has a history of smoking and alcohol consumption.’ Giving evidence to the hearing Mr Sellers said he was on anti- depressants and an inhaler for his COPD. He said he had been driving for 41 years but had only been driving the Suzuki for nine days.He said: ‘I do not normally have this cough generally. I have never fainted in my entire life.’ Asked what did on day of accident he said: ‘On way back from the cash and carry I had dropped into the Royal Oak for a pint of Carling.’ He was asked by the coroner Roger Whittaker if he knew that he should not drink on anti-depressants: ‘I am aware you should probably not drink in excess on anti-depressants but I did not know it could not at all.’ Frank Sellers had a coughing fit and was unable to control his vehicle as it hit schoolteacher Tracey Askham in Morrisons car park in Idle, West Yorkshire . Mr Whittaker asked: ‘Do you think there was anything you could or should have done to avoid the incident?’ Mr Sellers answered: ‘No.’ Delivering a narrative verdict Mr Whittaker said: ‘I have to say it is difficult to visualise the scene of what has happened, the way in which a simple shopping expedition turned into such a tragedy. ‘I am satisfied that Frank Sellers did have a coughing fit that did cause him to blackout. I am satisfied from that evidence he could have done nothing about this situation from that point on.’ ‘I do not believe a simple verdict of accidental death is appropriate for such an incident. I believe that this narrative verdict fulfils my obligation.’ His narrative verdict was: ‘Tracy Ashkam died from bronco pneumonia as a result of a crushing chest injury. She was in Morrisons car park putting her shopping in her Mini motorcar which was then struck by a Suzuki motor car. The driver of which had lost control over it as a result of an involuntary coughing fit. The verdict does not blame anyone.’","Tracey Askham, 47, went to Morrisons in Idle, near Bradford, for family tea .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . She was spotted in London on Thursday with a pram that cost a staggering £1,450. But, within 24 hours, Tamara Ecclestone has ventured out into the capital with her baby daughter Sophia pushing a second pram, a Bugaboo Cameleon3, £819, in as many days. Just like her cars, it seems just one ride isn't enough. Here we go again: Tamara Ecclestone seen pushing her other pram, a . Bugaboo Cameleon3, £819, on a stroll with pampered princess Sophia . Wearing a pair of leggings and a blue . fleeced top, the new mother looked healthy and happy as she walked . through Kensington Palace Gardens . The heiress - who is married to Jay . Rutland - made her public debut with their little girl on Wednesday but . obviously doesn't want her pride and joy to be seen in anything but the best. Bugaboo is the popular choice for new parents, but while it may be significantly cheaper than her blingtastic Silver Cross, it is still a premium choice, with the cheaper models starting from over £400. Wearing a pair of leggings and a blue fleeced top, the new mother looked healthy and happy as she walked through Kensington Palace Gardens. Matching her look with a pair of blue and white trainers, she has clearly snapped back into shape after giving birth less than one month ago. But onlookers will question Tamara's need for a secondary pram given how indulgent her other one iswith Swarovski . crystals. The daughter of Bernie Ecclestone displayed a more modest baby stroller when she was spotted out on Friday . Mother's nature: The brunette beauty has clearly taken to motherhood well . While it is not clear just how much . pram's customisation cost, just the Silver Cross - the iconic Balmoral . pram - itself costs a staggering £1,450. And . while there are several companies in the UK who offer the . customisation, it wouldn't have come cheaply for the heiress to get the . pram changed to her liking. However, Tamara didn't actually pay for her pram herself as it was a gift - from her sister Petra. Only the best! Tamara Ecclestone and Jay Rutland stepped out with daughter Sophia in a customised, crystal-encrusted pink Silver Cross pram in London on Wednesday . Doting: Tamara and Jay looked like the picture of parental bliss as they strolled along with Sophia in the sunshine . Personalised: . The pram also had the name 'Sophia' in a name plate on the front - in . case there is any doubt over who it belongs to . Bling: The pram itself, the Balmoral, costs £1,450 - while the customisation would have been more - including the baby's 'Sophia' nameplate would have been more . Fit for an Ecclestone princess: Sophia is riding in style in her blingtastic baby carriage . The Balmoral pram has been popular among celebrities for years, with stars including Lily Allen splashing out on the designs for their children. It not only looks good but boasts a hand-sprung chassis, is cushioned with leather suspension straps and features handspoked wheels. The transport also includes a lever operated brake system, a soft foam mattress for maximum comfort and an extremely large chrome shopping basket. While the pink hood and apron come as standard on the pram, it is the crystallised pink and silver detailing on the body of the pram that Tamara would have had to pay extra for. The pram also features a silver nameplate which read 'Sophia' on the front - just in case there is any doubt as to who is belongs to. Despite only giving birth to Sophia on 17th March, Tamara already appeared to have snapped back into shape. Are you ok in there? Tamara and Jay couldn't help but coo over their little charge mid-stroll . In 1877, inventor William Wilson created Silver Cross because of a lack of suitable buggies for his own children. He opened a small workshop in Silver Cross Street, Leeds, where he grew the business with the help of his three sons. In 1913, it became the official royal pram, and a special edition was created and sent to George VI for Princess Elizabeth, who is now Queen. After moving to larger premises, an old silk factory in Guiseley, it has grown to a worldwide brand, with more than 10million parents having bought one in more than 50 countries. Tamara's Balmoral pram from the Vintage Collection costs £1,450. The Kensington style starts at £950. The 29-year-old socialite showed off her post-baby body in a striped black and grey jumper with a pair of three-quarter length black leggings and pink Nike trainers for the outing on Tuesday. With her make-up and hair completely flawless, it's hard to believe that Tamara is a first time mother. Speaking to Hello! magazine recently about parenthood, Tamara said: 'Motherhood is the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I'm enjoying every minute of it. 'I knew I would love it - I just didn't know how much. I feel born to be a mother. 'Although I've always wanted children, . I've never felt that intensely before.

Tamara already appears to have snapped back into shape, less than three weeks after the birth of her daughter . Proud family: Tamara looked flawless in Sophia's first picture just minutes after her daughter's birth .

"By . Bianca London . and Deni Kirkova . When MailOnline launched a competition for one lucky mother to meet Enrique Iglesias, unsurprisingly, the entries came in thick and fast. But one entry, sent in by Josephine Haydney's son Myron, really stood out so FEMAIL granted them the opportunity of a lifetime to meet the global superstar. Myron, 16, explained what a huge fan his mother was in his entry: 'She has absolutely adored Enrique for the best part of 15 years (since I can remember). Best day ever! Josephine Haydney and son Myron were granted the opportunity of a lifetime to meet global superstar Enrique Iglesias . 'Literally, every single day mum listens to his albums for at least an hour, if not...2 or 3 hours.' Myron went on to explain how his 7-year-old sister is severely disabled and relies on his parents for all of her personal care and needs. She suffers from a rare condition called Cask Gene Mutation, and when she received her diagnosis, she was only the seventh person diagnosed in the world. Tragically for the family, last August, mum Josephine was diagnosed with breast cancer. 'Because of this, my family's whole world has turned upside down,' Myron told us. 'Mum hasn't been able to care for my sister like she used to because she hasn't had the strength to. She has had chemotherapy and she has been really sick and I feel helpless as there is nothing I can do to help her. Hero: Josephine had breast surgery a few days before the meet and greet, so, explained Myron, to meet Enrique a few days later (on Mother's Day) would be 'out of this world' for her - and it really was . 'All I want is to see her smile again like she did on her last chemo session and if she met Enrique, I am sure it would give her the extra strength to carry on.' Josephine had breast surgery a few days before the meet and greet, so, explained Myron, to meet Enrique a few days later (on Mother's Day) would be 'out of this world' for her. He added: 'It's not fair because my mum always puts other people before herself and she is just a complete inspiration to me. 'It's easy for me to say because she's my mum but I have never known anyone who is so caring and warm -hearted. Great son: Myron says his mother (pictured, right, at her last chemo session) is a complete inspiration to him . 'I just think mum deserves this so much because Enrique is what gives mum strength at the moment, let alone if she actually met him.' Myron and Josephine were whisked down to London from Cornwall for a luxurious night away and met the superstar. Speaking after the event, Myron said: 'I wanted to give my mum something to smile about again. 'We had a fantastic time meeting Enrique. It's given my mum the inspiration to fight cancer and stay positive.' A thrilled Josephine said: 'Winning the competition made me think that anything is possible. 'I never thought I would make a 6 hours journey from Cornwall to London just four days after my breast cancer surgery. It was the best Mother's Day present I could've ever wished for.' AND JOSEPHINE AND MYRON WEREN'T THE ONLY TWO TO MEET ENRIQUE...FEMAIL WRITER DENI KIRKOVA MET THE SPANISH HEARTTHROB . His fortieth isn't too far off but Enrique Iglesias looks hotter than ever. In an exclusive interview with FEMAIL the sexy Spaniard reveals the inspiration behind his new album, his top chat-up lines and his grooming secrets. Enrique, 38, reveals he doesn't like too much hair and he personally depilates everywhere. Scroll down for video . Enrique chats to FEMAIL about Sex & Love, his grooming routine and top chat up lines . When asked about his top grooming tips for men, Enrique reveals he keeps his routine simple but thorough. 'If you have a hairy back, shave it; brush your teeth; fake tan I'm not so much into. Not too much hair I guess - I shave everywhere. I'm kidding, I don't shave everywhere... But most places you do try to trim.' Enrique likes to keep things fragrant as well as tidy: he reveals he is coming out with a new fragrance for men called . Adrenaline - a completely new venture for him. 'I never thought I would say this but I was pretty involved in it, I wear it myself and I like it. 'It . has a woody kind of smell to it. I just went with my other favourites . that I would wear in the past and combined them and said ""This is the . direction I want to take it in"". It's going to come out towards the end . of the year.' Looking - and smelling - good is a priority for the star, who claims that since he's turned 30 keeping in shape hasn't been as easy. Enrique Iglesias, pictured earlier this month, says he prefers performing to burn calories rather than the gym . 'One of the things I've noticed, when . you turn 30 and up, you've gotta watch a little bit more what you eat. But in my case going on tour, two hours on stage, you actually lose a . lot of calories which is good. I notice when I'm not on tour I'm not in . as good shape. It helps me like a workout. 'When it comes down to the gym or . anything that's cardio, like running on the treadmill, I'm very lazy. What I like to do more is sports.

"By . Martin Robinson . A bullied schoolboy left a heartbreaking goodbye letter to his mother telling her: 'I can't cope any more' just before he died of a suspected overdose. Simon Brooks, 15, died in hospital four days after writing the note, which also blamed bullies for making his life a misery. His bereft mother Julie Brooks, 48, today said Simon had been picked on for 18 months and dreaded going to school in Pontyclun, South Wales. Heartbroken: Simon's mother Julie has paid tribute to her son and says he was mercilessly bullied at school . Tragedy: Schoolboy Simon Brooks admitted 'I can't cope any more' in the days before his death . She said: 'He wrote a goodbye letter in the notes of his mobile phone and it said: ""I can't cope any more"". 'He was being pushed about, having his bag grabbed and subjected to verbal abuse. 'He loved the lessons and had a lovely group of friends, but he wasn't being left alone at break times and lunchtimes.' Simon was found collapsed eight days ago at his family home in the village of Tonyrefail, near Pontypridd, South Wales. Police are investigating the family's claims that Simon was being bullied at Y Pant Comprehensive School. His mother said: 'He told the ambulance man who had took him to hospital: ""I'm being bullied"". 'Every Sunday night he would beg me not to send him to school. 'During the school holidays he would count the days and hours until he had to go back. 'He was so brave he used to go every day and try to stick up for himself. 'In the goodbye note he wrote for me he didn't name a name or blame anyone. 'If he was here he wouldn't want blood and revenge - he's just want peace.' Much-loved: Mrs Brooks said her son would beg not to go to school after bullying in the playground . Organic food supplier Mrs Brooks said Simon had 'clearly planned' his apparent suicide. The mother-of-five was at his bedside at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff where he died on Tuesday four days after taking tablets. Hard time: Simon had left his last school after being picked on and had tried to start again only to be targeted by bullies in his new school . She said: 'It was the worst four days of my life watching my darling child suffer and die. 'You can't imagine the searing pain of losing a child unless you have lost one. 'Simon was a sunshine child. He was so delightful, deep, sensitive and analytical. 'A part of me is gone forever and my life will never ever be the same without him in it. 'The love we shared will help warm the dark days ahead for us without him.' Mrs Brooks said Simon had been bullied at his previous school in Treorchy, South Wales, where he was allegedly assaulted on a train on the way to school. However Simon did not want to press charges. His mother said Simon had been punished for taking wine into school nine months ago to 'numb the pain of the bullies'. She said Simon didn't want to complain to the school authorities because he felt it . would only make things worse. Mrs Brooks and husband David wants lessons to be learned from Simon's death and has met with the school's headteacher Mark Powell since her son died. She said Mr Powell and his staff had been 'trying very hard' but schools were under pressure from government and were 'under the microscope'. Pupils staged a demonstration at the school in support of Simon and his family on Thursday afternoon - chanting his name in the playground. Police were told of the protest but a spokesman said it was dealt with by the school. A spokeswoman for Rhondda Cynon Taff Council said: 'Pupils wore purple on Wednesday as a mark of respect for Simon. 'Counsellors and educational psychologists have been at the school advising pupils, and parents were also being given support and grief guidance.' Headteacher Mr Powell said: 'We are all shocked and saddened by the death of Simon Brooks and our thoughts and sincere condolences are with his family and friends at this tragic time. 'We at the school and its wider community are struggling to come to terms with his sudden death and our main focuses at this time are to respect the wishes of his family and to support those pupils who have been affected.' The school's website says: 'We take every allegation of bullying very seriously at Y Pant and have a zero tolerance approach where we find bullying has occurred.' A South Wales Police spokesman said: 'We are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident which at this stage is not thought to be suspicious.'

"By . Ben Spencer . The spread of large solar farms should be controlled so they do not become as unpopular as wind turbines, the Energy Minister said yesterday. Greg Barker pledged that he would not allow solar power to ‘become the new onshore wind’. He said he wanted a shift away from huge solar farms that blight the landscape, in favour of small panels on the roofs of homes, offices and schools. Unsightly: The number of solar panel farms in Britain has risen in two years from 46 to 184 . Mr Barker said Britain’s rooftops should become mini power stations, as he announced a new solar strategy. The plans include turning Government offices, factories, supermarkets and car parks into ‘solar hubs’. His intervention comes after it emerged this week that the Prime Minister is planning to make a stand against onshore wind turbines before the next election. A Conservative source said that Mr Cameron is ‘of one mind’ with the loudest opponents of onshore windfarms and is considering a cap on the number of new turbines. Mr Barker said yesterday: ‘I do not want solar farms to become the new onshore wind. Energy Minister Greg Barker: 'I do not want solar farms to become the new onshore wind' ‘Solar power enjoys huge popularity, so we have to be careful. I do not want to see unrestricted growth of solar farms in the British countryside.’ He added: ‘We have put ourselves among the world leaders on solar and this ambitious strategy will place us right at the cutting edge. ‘There is massive potential to turn our large buildings into power stations and we must seize the opportunity this offers to boost our economy as part of our long-term economic plan. ‘Solar not only benefits the environment, it will see British job creation and deliver the clean and reliable energy supplies the country needs at the lowest possible cost to consumers.’ There has been a huge expansion in the number of large solar projects. Two years ago there were 46 large-scale farms in Britain, but by the end of February this year there were 184 projects. An additional 194 projects have planning permission and are awaiting construction. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘We want to move the emphasis for growth away from large solar farms and instead focus on opening up the solar market for the UK’s estimated 250,000 hectares [600,000 acres] of south-facing commercial rooftops.’ The Solar Trade Association welcomed the announcement, saying it would strengthen the UK’s position in the ‘booming’ global solar market. Chief executive Paul Barwell said: ‘Greg Barker has championed solar power specifically because he knows it has the greatest potential to empower millions of people across the UK with low-cost green energy. Solar will also provide thousands of good-quality local jobs.’ Tory plans to make a stand against onshore wind have been opposed by Lib Dems, including Mr Barker’s boss, Energy Secretary Ed Davey. Mr Davey told Parliament on Thursday: ‘Onshore wind is ... the cheapest large-scale renewable technology, and I would not want to do anything to reduce its deployment.’","Greg Barker said unsightly panels should go on roofs instead of in farms .

"By . Sara Malm . Pet owners in Thailand are being told to keep a close eye on their four-legged friends after hundreds of dog remains were found near the border of Laos. It is thought the dog remains, made up of hundreds of skins and bones which had been abandoned in a forest in Sakon Nakhon, northeastern Thailand, were destined for Vietnam and China. There, dog meat is considered a delicacy, but is also used to make leather products – in particular golf gloves made from canine testicles. In danger: Smugglers kidnap pet dogs as they are easier to catch than strays, and sell the skin to leather manufacturers in China and Vietnam . The find was made last month by Thai police, who revealed the purpose of the practice, which is illegal in Thailand. ‘The skins would be bleached - some are then sent (by smugglers) to other countries to be made into gloves for playing golf,’ Lamai Sakolpitak, from a special police unit to suppress smuggling and the trade in animal parts, told AFP. 'Extra soft': The skin from dogs' testicles are used to make golfing gloves . 'Experts say that dog skins are also used for instruments such as drums.’ Mr . Lamai said the find is linked to the March raids on two makeshift . factories in the area where smugglers would strip skin from dogs and . preserve the meat. Dog skin is highly sought after by manufacturers of golf gloves, predominantly the skin from the testicles as it is particularly soft, John Dalley, co-founder and vice-president of Thai dog welfare organisation Soi Dog Foundation, told Businessweek.com. Although there are thousands of stray dogs in Thailand’s many large cities, smugglers prefer domestic pets as they are easier to catch, Mr Dalley says. ‘Stray dogs are extremely difficult to catch. It’s far easier to catch pet dogs or unwanted service dogs,’ he says, adding that the illegal dog trade is extremely cruel. Mr Dalley, who has lived in Thailand for over a decade, says dogs are often packed into cages before being dragged out and skinned alive. Local campaign group Watchdog Thailand confirmed that dog skin is used for golf gloves, hats and wallets and that smugglers will offer to pay around $10 for a live dog, including pets and strays.

"By . Sara Malm . Ferry services between England and France are suffering severe disruption due to a 24-hour industrial action in northern France. The Port of Calais is closed after local staff went on a wild-cat strike, blocking roads leading to the port and making it impossible to unload ferries. An estimated 70 to 80 dock workers and crane drivers are on strike since midnight Thursday, following an industrial dispute between port authorities and the union. Industrial action block: An estimated 70 to 80 dock workers and crane drivers are on a wildcat strike in the Port of Calais, north France, since midnight Thursday (stock image) Ferry services are being disrupted in both directions and passengers are being advised to contact their operator before travelling. The industrial dispute between the CGT union and regional authorities springs from the decision to bring in contracted workers to unload ferries at Calais. ‘There is not much work for dockers and crane operators anyway and in a region where there is 18 per cent unemployment this is unacceptable,' a union spokesperson told The Local. Roads leading into the Port of Calais are blocked, leading to long traffic jams where reportedly several school buses heading to the UK are stuck. Local firefighters had to come to the rescue to a bus of British schoolchildren where several had taken ill or were in need of a bathroom. Jammed up: Roads in leading to both Calais port and Dove, pictured, are clogged with freight traffic and buses (stock image) P&O ferries warned that they will be running a limited service until further notice and urge passengers to consider other travel dates . French fireservices were able to escort the bus out of the jam towards the Channel Tunnel rail link, a local newspaper reported. Freight traffic is also starting to clog the roads leading to the port in Dover, Kent a spokesman for the Port of Dover said. As a result, Operation Stack could be implemented ‘imminently’ to hold freight on the coastbound carriageway of the M20 and alleviate the build-up of traffic. A Port of Dover spokesman said: ‘We will continue to monitor the situation closely in liaison with our ferry partners and the Port of Calais in order to resume normal operations as soon as possible. ‘Please note that there may be delays to services when the Port of Calais reopens. We apologise for any delays or inconvenience as a result of the industrial action in France.’ P&O ferries warned that they will be running a limited service until further notice. ‘We strongly recommend that if your travel is not essential that you rebook for an alternate date,’ the company said in a statement. The company said much of traffic from the UK to France has been directed to the Eurotunnel, and that the most severe disruptions regard the way from the continent to Dover. The Port of Dunkirk remains open.","Dockworkers on 24-hour industrial action in Port of Calais .

There are conflicting reports as to whether the bomb exploded before or after the convoy carrying the former leader, who is on trial for treason, had passed the bridge. Pakistani policemen inspect the site of a bomb explosion in Islamabad. Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, who is on trial for treason, escaped the bomb blast in the early hours, police said . The bomb exploded as the general was being moved late Wednesday night from the military hospital in Rawalpindi where he has been staying to his home in the capital Islamabad . Musharraf's spokeswoman, Aasia Ishaq, said the retired general (pictured) was fine and reached his home safely but that it was up to the authorities to make sure nothing happens to him . Senior police official Liaqat Niazi told AFP four kilograms of explosives, planted in a pipeline under a bridge, exploded roughly 20 minutes before Musharraf was due to cross.

Timelapse photography was used to capture the sticks movement, while a 'Matrix style' camera rig was set up around the drummer Ben Mead to capture his in 260 degrees. Scroll down to see the video . The team created a special 'time slice' camera rig which encircled the drummer to produce this stunning matrix-like effect of the drummer in mid flow . 'Rhythm is the root of everything, I'm always looking for new ways to explore it,' said Brighton-born Mead. 'I've always wanted to see what rhythm might look like, to see the shape of sound,' he explained. The video is part of an ad for whisky firm Ballantine's. It developed special software to process the images captured and make the trails glow. Drummer Ben Mead used special sticks with lights fitted to create the amazing effects. The timelapse images were created for a commercial, along with a 'matrix' style scene which sees the camera moving around the drummer as he plays. 'In order to capture the stunning light trails, a bespoke application was developed C++ using the Cinder creative coding framework, taking a HD video feed from the main shoot camera and pulls out the LED-tipped drumsticks,' the firm explained. 'The trails are not computer generated, but come directly from the images from the camera, creating light trails of the desired length and intensity. 'In addition, a 360 degree â€˜time slice rigâ€™ was used by Ben and the team to capture the light trails in 3D.'

"By . John Stevens . Huge legal bill: Dr Kathleen Baker, 72, who has spent 50 years fighting with another pensioner over the ownership of a £2million property in Cornwall . She has spent 50 years locked in a battle over her late father’s estate after it was left to his alleged mistress. Now, Kathleen Baker has argued that the woman could not have been his lover as he was impotent. The retired academic, 72, has gone to the High Court to try to force Audrey Line, the owner of Harrogate House in Falmouth, to hand over a share of the spectacular beachfront property. It is the latest twist in the battle over the £2million home on the Cornish Riviera that has cost Dr Baker hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal fees. Her father Albert ran and owned a hotel in the town with Miss Line’s mother Norah Duff, with whom he was said to be having an affair in the 1950s. Since his death in 1961, the pair’s respective daughters have been at loggerheads over who was due what share of the property. The court heard the row has led to a series of alleged incidents including Miss Line being arrested for unfounded fraud allegations, and Dr Baker ‘rampaging’ through the hotel. Dr Baker’s father and Norah had set up a company together to run the Palm Beach Hotel in Falmouth. But a year after his death, his share of the hotel was transferred to her, making her the owner. She later transferred the ownership to her daughter Audrey, who sold the Palm Beach and bought Harrogate House, a 1920s property that was designed by renowned Cornish architect Alfred Cornelius and overlooks Gyllyngvase Beach. Dr Baker denies that her father was having an affair and has said that the transfer of his share of the hotel was invalid. Her barrister, Graham Sinclair, told the High Court in London  she was entitled to ‘trace and follow the value of such shares into the hands of Miss Line’, ultimately, to Harrogate House. Miss Line, 71, said Dr Baker was ‘in denial’ and was trying to make her homeless. Her lawyer, Guy Adams, told the court the battle stemmed from Dr Baker’s ‘unsubstantiated suspicions’ about the administration of her father’s estate in the early 1960s. Speaking after the hearing, Dr Baker, who lives in a £350,000 house in Colchester, Essex, said: ‘My father did not have an affair with that woman. He was actually impotent as he had been struck down with tuberculosis. ‘I will not have his reputation sullied.’ Beach view: Harrogate House, home of Audrey Line in Falmouth, Cornwall, which is worth £2million . Dr Baker said her father, who amassed his wealth through timber and construction firms, remained faithful to her mother, Phyllis. She claimed he regarded Norah as an employee and was planning on ‘asking her to go’. Dr Baker, who is married, said he once poured slops into a shoe belonging to Norah, and asked: ‘Do you think I’d want to sleep with a woman like that?’ She claims that a second will that left her a quarter of his estate went missing. 'I will not have his reputation sullied': Dr Baker's father with her mother in the 1950s. Dr Baker believes her father was left impotent by tuberculosis and was thus incapable of having a mistress . Dr Baker denies claims in court that she had to be forcibly removed from the Palm Beach in 1997 after she and her sister ‘rampaged around the hotel, pointing out things they said belonged to them’. Miss Line said last night: ‘She’s in denial that my mother and her father lived together. She is trying to take my house from me.’ Judge Kevin Prosser QC has reserved judgment and will give his ruling at a later date.","Retired academic Kathleen Baker is fighting for share of beachfront home .

"By . Damien Gayle . Blood on his shoe: Liam Chisholm was jailed for two years for a vicious unprovoked attack on a disabled man who was left with boot prints on his face . An attacker who viciously beat a learning disabled man for no reason has been sent to prison for two years. Liam Chisholm, 24, was one of three thugs who pounced on Andrew Thornton from behind as he played with his dog Darcy on parkland in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear. The trio punched and kicked their victim in his face and head until he was concussed and bleeding heavily. They left the cerebral palsy sufferer unconscious in the grass, his face marked with boot prints, with just loyal Darcy, a mongrel terrier, by his side. After the beating, 'placid' 25-year-old Mr Thornton, who had been a keen runner, was left scared to go out alone. In an effort to track down the attackers, his father Michael circulated a picture of his son's injuries. Outraged wellwishers quickly spread it across social media. As a result of the social media and press appeal Chisholm, of Hebburn, who has previous convictions, was arrested and admitted assault. Today, at Newcastle Crown Court, a judge sentenced him to two years in prison for the 'appalling' unprovoked beating in March last year. Passing sentence, Recorder Ben Nolan QC told Chisholm: 'Your victim was a 25-year-old man who is described in a victim impact statement as mild mannered young man. 'He suffered from cerebral palsy and learning difficulties and threrefore was an extremely vulnerable young man . 'You and two others, for no reason, set about upon him in a park and gave him a very bad beating. 'I have seen the pictures. He has footprints on his face. 'This was an appalling offence of its type. 'Fortunately, the press issued an appeal and members of the public came forward with information that led to your arrest. 'The message must go out that offences of this type will be met with significant prison sentences.' 'Placid': Cerebral Palsy sufferer Andrew Thornton, 25, who was left with horrific facial injuries and a boot print on his face after being attacked by mindless thugs while out walking his dog in Campbell Park, Hebburn . Prosecutor Richard Herrmann told the court that Mr Thornton was attacked while he was out enjoying a teatime walk with his dog. 'Mr Thornton, who was walking his dog, minding his own business, throwing a stick for his dog, was approached from behind,' said Mr Herrmann. 'He recalls nothing after being punched to the back of the head and remembers then waking up on hospital.' The injured Mr Thornton was helped by passers by who found him injured. He was taken to hospital where he had to undergo x-rays and a brain scan but had suffered no permanent or lasting damage. When Chisholm was arrested he had Mr Thornton’s blood on his shoe. Mr Herrmann said the effect of the violence on Mr Thornton left him afraid to go out alone and caused a marked change in his behaviour. Katherine Dunn, defending, said in mitigation that Chisholm had a 'troubled childhood' and struggled with a serious alcohol problem. 'An appalling offence': Jailing Chisholm for two years at Newcastle Crown Court, Recorder Ben Nolan QC told him that the message must go out that offences of this type will be met with significant prison sentences . Mr Thornton snr, a 49-year-old spray painter, released the shocking picture after his son’s assault in the hope his attackers would be brought to justice. He said shortly after the incident: 'Andrew had been out for about an hour with his dog when he was set upon from behind. 'He can’t remember much of the attack apart from having seen a group of three lads aged about 19 to 22 hanging around on Monkton Lane shortly beforehand, and then being aware of someone approaching him quickly from the behind and to the side. 'He was knocked down and concussed. There are boot prints on his face. 'A young lad found him afterwards, called paramedics and stayed with him till they arrived, as did a woman who was passing by. 'It just goes to show there are still some good people left in the world.'","Liam Chisholm, 24, had blood on his shoe when he was arrested .

"By . Steve Doughty . Previous UN visitor: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith called Raquel Rolnik a 'loopy Brazilian lefty' United Nations human rights chiefs have launched an investigation into violence against women in Britain. A UN 'special rapporteur' will spend two weeks inquiring into 'the main manifestations of violence perpetrated in the family and in the community' and whether the British Government condones it. The visit by South African academic and equality campaigner Rashida Manjoo provoked anger among ministers, who fear it will produce a fresh set of UN demands for radical new laws. One Government source said the inquiry would produce 'a fiesta of politically correct nonsense about a serious issue'. Last . autumn the UN's special rapporteur on adequate housing, Brazilian . Raquel Rolnik, invited herself to Britain and delivered a report . demanding the abolition of what she called, to the fury of Tory . politicians, 'the bedroom tax'. Mrs . Rolnik spoke to left-wing activists, called for rent controls, and . recommended a massive programme of public housing construction. Work and . Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith called her a 'loopy Brazilian . lefty', described her report as 'outrageous', and said she had . compromised the impartiality of the UN. The . new inquiry by Professor Manjoo is the latest in a number of visits to . different countries to examine the plight of women she has made since . her appointment in 2009. In the United States she said government policies were 'inadequate', called for more gun control, for a sheaf of new anti-discrimination laws, for fewer women to be imprisoned, and for the re-introduction of tribal law in Native American communities. In Algeria, however, Professor Manjoo found the country had 'distinguished itself in the promotion of gender equality' and praised the government's family code as 'aimed at gradually effecting social change with the participation of the community.' This put her at odds with Amnesty International, which has said the code 'imposed many serious limitations on women's rights' and that women suffer 'considerable discrimination in law and practice.' Professor Manjoo, who arrived in Britain on Monday, said: 'Violence against women continues to be one of the most pervasive human rights violations globally, affecting every country in the world. 'During my mission I will meet with individuals and organisations involved in fighting all aspects related to violence against women, its causes and consequences with a view to assessing the phenomenon in the country,' she added. The United Nations headquarters building in New York . The UN said she will 'also look at violence that is perpetrated or condoned by State authorities, and violence encountered by women facing new vulnerabilities due to the increased influx of immigrant women, asylum seekers and refugees.' Professor Manjoo said: 'Importantly, I will visit shelters to obtain first-hand information from individual survivors of gender-based violence.' Interventions by UN representatives in British domestic politics have become increasingly controversial since 2011, when a UN adviser on forced eviction, Professor Yves Cabannes, visited an illegal traveller site in Essex in advance of an eviction. He declared that 'a study which I led on forced eviction found that at Dale Farm, and the UK in general, the government is violating international human rights law on three points - the right to adequate housing, the right to be defended from forced eviction and discrimination.' Last year's visit by the housing rapporteur Mrs Rolnik was said by the UN to be at the invitation of the British government. However, ministers said the visit was conducted on her own initiative, and that the 'invitation' was no more than formal protocol extended at the insistence of the Foreign Office. The UN said yesterday that Professor Manjoo 'visits the country at the invitation of the Government'. A Whitehall source involved in Government policy on domestic violence said: 'Going on previous experience, this is going to be another fiesta of politically correct nonsense about a serious issue, that bears no relation to the reality of the challenges real people face in the real world.'","Visit by equality campaigner provoked anger among ministers .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . A pair of robbers who kidnapped a 62-year-old man by locking him in the boot of his own car before leaving the victim inside, nine miles from his home, have been jailed for 19 years. The crooks then demanded £50,000 from the man because they wrongly believed he was a drug dealer. When he could not give them the money, the pair tied him up with a dressing gown cord, a court heart. Alexander Blake, 22, and Ryan Blakeney, 23, barged into the unsuspecting victim's home in Dorridge, West Midlands on April 10 last year. Alexander Blake and Ryan Blakeney attempted to extort £50,000 out of a man they wrongly believed to be a drug dealer. When he could not pay, the pair kidnapped the man in his own car and left him stranded in its boot . They then used a plastic cable and a . dressing gown cord to tie the victim up before threatening him with a . knife and boiling water. After searching the man's home, the robbers that realised it was a case of mistaken identity and that they had targeted the wrong person so reduced their demands to £20,000 and then £10,000. They proceeded to steal a fake Rolex watch and £150 from the victim's pocket before bundling him into the boot of his car and driving east towards Birmingham. A court heart that Blake had then boasted about the watch saying in text messages that he had acquired a 'Rolly'. Forensic examination of his phone also showed that he had sent photos of the . fake watch to contacts. The duo then left the man stranded in the Tyseley area, south east of the city centre, but the victim managed to wriggle free and call police on his mobile. Officers found the victim in the early hours of April 11. In the days after the kidnapping, he received 13 calls and three text messages from the robbers demanding cash. Police intelligence led detectives to identify Blake, who lived in Tyseley, Birmingham as a key suspect and he was arrested on April 17 by officers outside a Job Centre after he had signed on. Blakeney, from Lee Bank in north east Birmingham, was arrested on May 1 by officers who spotted him bolting from a rear door during a search of a property. The pair denied charges of robbery, kidnap and blackmail but were found guilty at Birmingham Crown Court. Alexander Blake's mother Joyce Blake tried to give her son an alibi, claiming that he had been with her on the night of the robbery, a court heart . Blake was ordered to serve 11 years behind bars, with his accomplice Blakeney jailed for eight years. The jury failed to reach a decision on a third suspect, Hanif Tuitt-Sinclair, 23, of Sheldon, Birmingham. After a second hung jury yesterday, prosecutors chose not to pursue a third trial and reporting restrictions on Blake and Blakeney were lifted. The court heard CCTV footage showed Blakeney performing a recce of the victim's home and the hire car used to drive the pair to the property on the night of the robbery was even booked in his mother's name. Blake was joined behind bars by his mother Joyce Blake, 53, and girlfriend Anesha Masikane-Cummins, 23, who tried to give him an alibi. The court heard the pair approached police on October 7 last year claiming he spent the night at home with them in Tyseley at the time of the kidnap. But phone analysis showed Masikane-Cummins was in Erdington, Birmingham, that night and even sent a message to Blake at 1am on April 11 saying 'wat u duin'. Joyce Blake, of Tyseley, and Masikane-Cummins, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, were both jailed for two years and 18 months after they pleaded guilty to attempting to pervert the course of justice. Blake's girlfriend Anesha Maiskane-Cummins was also handed two years and 18 months for attempting to pervert the courts of justice . After the hearing, Detective Superintendent Simon Wallis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'These are extremely serious crimes. 'It . was a case of mistaken identity and, unfortunately for all involved, . they targeted a completely innocent man who has no connections to drug . dealing. 'Blake's mother and girlfriend plotted to invent a false alibi in an attempt to put him in the clear. 'But we were quickly able to expose their lies and they too are now paying a heavy price for trying to pervert the course of justice. 'Lying to police or the courts is very serious. Anyone attempted to do so must be aware that their actions could cost them their liberty.'","Pair broke into man's house near Birmingham demanding £50,000 .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A gang of Eastern European Roma gipsies who have been terrorising residents, tourists and shopkeepers near Marble Arch were moved along by immigration officials in the early hours of this morning – but had already returned to the area by the afternoon. Police, council officials and Home Office immigration staff successfully raided the area outside a plush Park Lane apartment block at around 2am, resulting in 14 of the gang agreeing to return home. The group of rough sleepers have been congregating in the area for around two years and businesses in Park Lane - one of the richest areas of Mayfair - and Marble Arch have complained the gang constantly harass customers and staff and cause sanitation problems. The group of rough sleepers have been congregating in the area for around two years and businesses in Park Lane, one of the richest areas of Mayfair, and Marble Arch have complained the gang constantly harass customers . Police, council officials and Home Office immigration staff raided the area at around 2am, resulting in 14 of the gang agreeing to return home. However, by 2pm many of the group had returned . Locals claim many in the group are armed with walking sticks or crutches with knives on the bottom to slash open rubbish bags to check for anything of value before leaving the contents strewn all over the floor for the council to clean up. Makeshift camps have been set up next to Marble Arch itself and the area is used as an outside toilet. The gang have been sleeping outside the newsagents for around two years and arrive every night at 9pm before leaving at about 6am. Despite today’s early morning raid, at least one person could be seen back begging at the spot less than 12 hours later – although nine people in the gang were issued with immigration papers which means they have 30 days to leave the area. Local residents claim they are too scared to use their own front door due to the intimidating group of gipsies. One 87-year-old resident got so fed up with having to clamber over bodies to get to her front door that she wrote to the Duke of Westminster to complain about it. The gang have been sleeping outside the newsagents outside Marble Arch Station for around two years and they arrive every night at 9pm before leaving at about 6am . Police handed out a notice, left, to businesses on Park Lane today informing them of their plans to reduce the number of rough sleepers currently in the area. Despite 14 gipsies agreeing to leave the area in the early morning raid, at least one beggar, right, had returned by the afternoon to continue to harass passers-by . The prestigious address is home to Saudi Royalty as well as a prime minister's family, with the penthouse in the apartment block costing an estimated £25,000 a week to rent. Chauffeur Patrick O'Toole, 54, said he has seen police move on the group about 12 times within the last two years. He said: ‘We have to phone the council all the time about them. ‘As soon as people put their rubbish bags out they are tearing all the bags open, chucking rubbish everywhere. ‘In the evening residents are too frightened to use the front door if they see them outside.’ He says that men in the group have repeatedly tried the gold ring scam on him, in which you are approached by someone saying that you have dropped a gold ring on the floor. They then produce a cheap brass ring with hallmarks on and say you should give them money because they have 'helped you find the ring'. ‘It's just gone berserk over the last two years,’ Mr O'Toole said. ‘It's happened to me four times in one week. It just really annoys me. Nine people in the gang were issued with immigration papers in this morning's raid which means they have 30 days to leave the area . Police say they are working to build a case against some members of the gang so they can be issued with Anti-Social Behaviour Orders . ‘I see them doing it to American tourists and I get out the car to warn them then they turn round looking like they are going to stab me. It's just not on.’ Police say they are working to build a case against some members of the gang so they can be issued with ASBOs. Arif Islam, 30, who has been working in the newsagent near where the gang sleep, says the problem is made worse by Arab tourists who give them large amounts of money. ‘The Arab people help them a lot. Only yesterday one of them bought drinks and food for all of them. They give the whole group £5 or £10 each. These people know what they are doing,’ Mr Islam said. ‘They pretend to have a problem with their leg but you see them later walking completely normally. ‘One of my neighbours told them to move and they urinated all over his shop. I'm too frightened to tell them anything.’ One street cleaner for Westminster Council, who did not want to be named, said his job had become almost impossible over the past two years since the group arrived. The group were the target of a police and Home Office coordinated night-time raid with 14 of them arrested and a further nine told to leave within 30 days . Arif Islam, 30, who has been working in the newsagent near where the gang sleep, says the problem is made worse by tourists who give the beggars, pictured, large amounts of money . ‘They've made my job so much harder. I get complaints all the time that I haven't done my job but as soon as I clean it, they're back,’ he said. ‘I just can't keep up with them. They have walking sticks and crutches with knives on the end of them to cut open the bags and they just turn the stuff out onto the floor. ‘They are looking for things they can get money for, clothes and stuff. When I come round in the morning all the bags are open in the roads around here, everywhere you go there are open bags.’ The group were the target of a police and Home Office coordinated night-time raid with 14 of them arrested and a further nine told to leave within 30 days. Local residents claim they are too scared to use their own front door due to the intimidating group of gipsies who constantly beg for money in the area . A Met Police spokesperson said: ‘Neighbourhood policing teams in Westminster, in partnership with Westminster City Council and other agencies, have this morning broken up encampments of eastern European rough sleepers in Park Lane. ‘There are a number of individuals believed to be rough sleeping at Marble Arch that police are building evidence against for anti-social behaviours orders (ASBOs). ‘Home Office Immigration Enforcement, rough sleeping outreach workers and street cleansing teams have also been involved in today's operation, which has seen 14 rough sleepers agree to return home, while a further nine will be issued with immigration papers requiring them to leave within 30 days. ‘Immigration officers established whether they were exercising their treaty rights and Westminster City Council will clean up and deal will any detritus and sanitation issues. ‘This is in response to local complaints received from residents and the business community. ‘This is an ongoing issue. Whilst some very good progress is being made, this issue persists and all agencies are committed to dealing with this matter in a robust and proportionate fashion.’ From 1 January any illegal European immigrant removed or who voluntarily leaves the UK having been found to be staying illegally will be unable to re-enter the UK for 12 months if there's a chance of ‘abuse’ of the system.","Police and immigration officials raided Marble Arch area in the early hours .

The TfL Overground said it is ‘looking into the circumstances’ surrounding the message which was sent to frustrated customer @dan_down. The Twitter spat started when @dan_down posted a message saying: ‘Sort it out @LDNOverground. If I’m late once more this month I lose 25 per cent of my salary.

It prompted TfL to apologise for the brash message with the @LDNOverground account posting: ‘Apologies for the response you received earlier. I don't think it was meant to come across like that. I'll get this looked into.’ Vernon Everitt, TfL’s managing director for customer experience, marketing and communications, said: ‘We apologise to Dan for sending him this extremely unhelpful message. ‘Dan is absolutely right to complain and we are looking into the circumstances of how it came about.’ However, @dan_down said he wasn’t ‘accepting apologies’ and took to his Twitter page to inform his 450 followers he had emailed customers services ‘in the hope it’s taken seriously’.

"By . Harriet Arkell . Coronation Street star Barbara Knox, 80, has been with drink driving in Cheshire, police said today . Coronation Street actress Barbara Knox has been charged with drink-driving, police said this afternoon. The 80-year-old, who plays Rita Tanner in the ITV soap, was charged by Cheshire police today after attending a police station to answer bail. She was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence last month at Knutsford Police Station after going to visit her daughter, Maxine Ashcroft, 56, who had just been arrested for the same offence. A Cheshire Police spokesman said: 'Police have charged an 80-year-old woman with drink driving following an incident in Knutsford on 10 March 2014. 'The woman turned up at Knutsford Police Station in relation to a separate matter and was arrested.' He said Knox, of Knutsford, Cheshire, is due to appear before Macclesfield Magistrates' Court on 24 April. Earlier this week, Knox's daughter, of Lechlade, Gloucestershire, was fined and banned from driving for two years after pleading guilty to drink-driving. Magistrates in Macclesfield heard that Ashcroft was arrested after being stopped by police while driving home a relative, believed to be her actress mother, from a family gathering in Alderley Edge, Cheshire. Ashcroft's lawyer Nick 'Mr Loophole' Freeman said she had made a 'terrible error of judgement' in what was a 'classic case of alcohol anaesthetising good sense'. He said the divorcee had recently moved from Cheshire to a more rural location in Gloucestershire where the nearest shop was six miles away. Ashcroft was banned from driving for fined £960 and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a £96 victim surcharge.

"By . Paul Newman . Alastair Cook has broken his silence on the reasons behind the sacking of Kevin Pietersen and insists the England dressing room will be better off without him. The England captain, frustrated by the ECB’s insistence that he still cannot give his full side of the story for legal reasons, was at least able yesterday to back the decision to part with the gifted maverick in an attempt to restore team unity. Cook was careful in what he said at the Essex media day but he realised it would be foolhardy if he ducked the opportunity to have his say on Pietersen with feelings running high in English cricket after a winter of utter discontent. That did not stop Pietersen's wife, former pop star Jessica Taylor, responding on Twitter to Cook's assertion that the decision took 'guts'. Fighting his corner: England captain Alastair Cook insists sacking Kevin Pietersen during the Ashes tour of Australia was the 'right decision' Fractured: Cook is still unable to tell the full story of Pietersen's dismissal because of legal wranglings . Outburst: Pietersen's wife Jessica Taylor took to Twitter after Cook's words . ‘I know it was the right decision,’ insisted Cook at Chelmsford when asked about the Pietersen sacking. ‘It was a brave call and it took a lot of guts to make it but people have been talking about it as if it just happened overnight. It didn’t. ‘The last thing that was intended was making Kevin a scapegoat for what happened in Australia. That’s not how it was at all. 'There comes a time when you do have to say ‘right, this is what we want moving forward’ and that was the decision taken. To say it was almost a call made by the toss of a coin is very wrong and disrespectful to the guys who made it. ‘A lot of effort went into getting him back in the side in the first place in 2012 and a lot of effort and thought went into the decision that has been made now.’ End game: Pietersen walks off after being dismissed during the fourth Ashes Tests in Melbourne. England lost the series 5-0 . Centre stage: Cook lines up with his Essex teammates during the county's official photo call in Chelmsford ahead of the forthcoming County Championship season . The mention of 2012 was, of course, extremely relevant as that was when Cook, along with Andy Flower, decided to give Pietersen one final chance despite the hurt and outrage caused by the text messages he sent to South African players criticising and insulting the then England captain Andrew Strauss. Pietersen, who was suspended before returning to the England team in India, was given a final written warning and Sportsmail understands his behaviour deteriorated so much towards the end of the disastrous Ashes winter that the ECB now have a four-page dossier full of his various misdemeanours. The presence of that document meant that Paul Downton, the new England managing director, was faced with a ‘no brainer’ of a decision to jettison Pietersen but it is the ECB’s questionable public relations policy since then that has seen flak thrown at the likes of Cook and Flower without the public knowing the full story. The captain insists that they will find out very soon. Defeated: Pietersen and Cook walk off in dismay after England are defeated by Australia on the fourth day of the fourth Test at the MCG . Explanation: Cook insisted that the full version of events surrounding Pietersen's sacking will emerge in due course . ‘I can’t answer questions about Kevin fully at the moment which is incredibly frustrating for me but there are a number of reasons why he went which will become clear,’ said Cook. ‘I know people will keep asking me about it but I hope everyone will understand the situation I’m in until we can give the answers. At the moment I just can’t. ‘If anyone thinks the decision was taken lightly without a lot of consideration and thought they’re wrong. A lot went into it and it was a tough decision. It will become clearer.’ Cook understands the need for the full story to come out sooner rather than later because, like Banquo’s ghost at the feast, Pietersen will always be in the background this summer haunting England while a legal gagging order prevails. Happier times: Cook is applauded by Pietersen and raises his bat after scoring a century against Bangladesh in Dhaka in March 2010 . The confidentiality agreement signed by the ECB and Pietersen to cover the terms of his severance package expires at the end of September but for the good of all involved England need to find a way of fronting up fully before then. The captain, who now has a chance to build a team in his own image and prove his strength as a leader, is adamant that the dressing room will be better now without Pietersen as England attempt to rebuild from the desperate depths they have plumbed, culminating in the final indignity of defeat by Holland. ‘Yes, moving forward that will be the way,’ said Cook when asked if the dressing room will now be a better place. ‘We all know how important team culture and unity are. We are in a results driven business but sometimes you have to get the basics in place first. I understand why the ECB have taken the stance they have but I just hope people can be patient with our explanation.’ Contrast: Cook and Ian Bell stand dejected as they watch Australia collect the Ashes Urn in Sydney back in January following a 5-0 whitewash . Success: Three years earlier, Andrew Strauss and Cook celebrate after England's 3-1 series win over australia in the 2010-2011 series . When Cook returned from Australia after the successful Ashes tour in 2011, with the small matter of 766 Test runs to his name, he was a hero. Now things could not be more different and the captain has the biggest challenge of his career to put right the wrongs of a disastrous six months. ‘When you lose 5-0 it’s almost as if people can’t bear to look at you and you feel embarrassed about it,’ Cook admitted. ‘But it can happen when you play sport at the highest level and, even though I don’t want to use the word cyclical, sometimes that’s what it is. 'When you don’t do yourself justice as a player it’s hugely frustrating. Sometimes the harder you try the worse it gets but that’s sport and it’s how you bounce back from those moments that defines you. ‘There have been times when I’ve struggled for runs and other times when I’ve found batting quite easy and I’ve been working very hard on my game in the last month and hopefully I’ll see the rewards of that.’ At home: Cook in front of the Essex County Ground sign in Chelmsford during the club's media open day on Tuesday . Make it snappy: Cook and Monty Panesar turn the camera on the photographers . Cook will begin his own quest for form for Essex against Cambridge University at Fenner’s next week, providing all is well with the imminent arrival of his first child. He knows both him and England face a long journey back. ‘It is a new start, it has to be, and we have an opportunity now to begin again,’ said Cook. ‘That doesn’t mean we’re going to guarantee lots of good results because that’s not how sport works. 'We have to earn the right to get back where we were and we might have to do that with a totally different side. ‘Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss started out from a similar position to where we are now after we were bowled out for 51 in Jamaica and things take time. 'We played our best cricket as a side against India in 2011 and it took two-and-a-half years to build that momentum, learning how to win and with people feeling happy in the side. That’s how long it took to get that side playing to its peak so you can’t put a time frame on it. 'What I do know is that it won’t happen overnight and it will take a lot of work.’ He may have had the toughest of times and he may be frustrated at not being able to give his side of the Pietersen story but Alastair Cook remains a cricketer and a man of substance. Most importantly, he dearly wants what is best for English cricket and he remains the best man, along with whichever new coach England choose, to put things right this summer.","KP's wife responds on Twitter to latest Cook revelations .

"By . Rebecca English . and Martin Robinson . The birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child - a future heir to the throne - will be announced in exactly the same way as Prince William's to retain 'the theatre' of a genuine royal occasion. As soon as the baby is born, a proclamation signed by doctors who delivered the boy or girl will be rushed from the ward and displayed at the gates of Buckingham Palace within minutes. Like the late Princess Diana before her, Kate, 31, has chosen the Lindo . Wing at St Mary’s where a natural birth, staying in a private suite, is . likely to cost up to £10,000. Same again: On June 22 1982 a sign on an easel was placed at the gates of Buckingham Palace announcing the birth, the previous day, of Prince William. The same will happen this year with his child . Historic: The same easel will be used when the . royal baby is born in around a month's time (left), and will use the . same kind of  written announcement when William Wales came into the world (right) William, 30, became the first future . monarch in history to be born in a hospital when he was delivered there . on June 21, 1982, followed by his brother, Harry, two years later. Although both Buckingham Palace and Clarence House have their own . Twitter accounts on which details of royal events are frequently now . broken, it will most definitely not be the . preferred medium to announce the new royal baby. Instead a formal notice on a piece of creamy A4 size Buckingham . Palace-headed paper, signed by the medical staff who have assisted the . Duchess, will be brought out of the Lindo’s front entrance by a press . officer. It will then be handed to a waiting driver and driven through the . streets of London – escorted by police outriders - to the Privy Purse . Door at the front of Buckingham Palace. Loving mother: Diana, the Princess of Wales with her son, Prince William, on her lap at Kensington Palace. Her son and his wife will also hold a similar official shoot after the baby is born . There it will then be placed on an easel, last used to announce Prince . William’s birth, by the main gates in the palace forecourt. This will signify to an eager public that a new royal baby has been born. 31 years ago: A newborn Prince William with Diana Princess of Wales and Prince Charles outside St. Mary's hospital on June 22, 1982 . ‘We wanted to retain some of the theatre of the notice. It . is quite important to us that this is done properly and with the degree . of dignity that the event demands. This is the birth of a child who will . be in line to the throne. It is a rare occasion and it is nice to be . able to do it with some historical precedence,' a Palace spokesman said. ‘It is very important [to us] that it . will not be announced first on Twitter, although it will be announced on . Twitter in due course.’ At the same time, however, Kensington . Palace does plan to send out an 'electronic press release' containing a . little more detail, such as the baby’s weight. When Prince William was . born, for example, it was revealed by press officers that he had blue . eyes and had ‘cried lustily’ as he was handed to his parents. However, if the baby is born between 10.30pm and 8am, the news will be sent out via press release with the easel being erected later that morning, at around 9am. ‘If the baby is born late at night, it would be unreasonable not to tell anyone [and] we wouldn’t run around with a police escort at 3am. We would be slightly disappointed not to announce it on the easel first, but would still put the notice up the next morning,’ an aide explained. Palace sources have also made clear the birth will not be made public until the Queen and senior members of the royal family have been informed  - and, of course, the Middletons, in the unlikely scenario that they are not at the hospital. MailOnline understands that William himself is likely to phone the Queen before anyone else, even his own father, depending on what time of day the baby is born. ‘Clearly if they are together the Middleton family will be informed pretty quickly….efforts will be made to contact the Queen soon after and members of the royal family will be told as soon as is practically possible. Whether they are woken depends on what time of day it was,’ the source added. Happy moment: When William was born, details were released almost immediately, including that he had blue eyes and had 'cried lustily' as he was handed to his parents . It is also hoped that William will make a short statement on the steps of the hospital after the good news has been dispersed – as will the Middletons, although the mechanics of this have yet to be discussed. ‘While it is a deeply personal and private event, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge realise this is a time of national celebration and that there will be vast interest in the baby. They realise many people will want to share in their happiness,’ a spokesman said. Unusually, palace officials will also . make public the fact that the Duchess has gone into labour within . minutes of her being admitted to hospital and being seen by a doctor. While palace aides are keen to retain . Kate’s ‘dignity’ as a woman in labour, they acknowledge the fact that . social media such as Twitter will make it almost impossible to keep her . admittance a secret unless she is smuggled in. The Royal Household’s official Surgeon-gynaecologist, Alan Farthing, the former fiancée of murdered television presenter Jill Dando, is by happy co-incidence a consultant gynaecologist at St Mary’s and will be assisting with the labour. He will be led by the Queen’s own Surgeon-Gynaecologist, Marcus Setchell. It is understood that contingency plans have been put in place with other hospitals, such as the Royal Berkshire in Reading, in case the Duchess goes into labour when visiting her parents.","Birth to be announced on historic easel at gates of Buckingham Palace .

"By . Laurie Kamens . A Massachusetts police dog got a official send off as over a dozen officers saluted the hound on his way to be put down. Kaiser, a two and a half year old German Shepard, was a member of the Plymouth, Massachusetts police department. The dog was laid to rest after a brief battle with kidney disease by handler Ptl. Jamie Lebretton, who lead the K-9 through a gauntlet of officers paying tribute to the crime fighting canine. Fellow Massachusetts police officers pay tribute to Kaiser, a German Shepard in the K-9 unit suffering from kidney disease, as he is walks into the pet hospital to be put down . In a heart-breaking Facebook post on the Plymouth Police Working Dog Foundation's page Officer Lebretton wrote, 'It . is with deep regret and sorrow that I announce the retirement of my . partner K-9 Kaiser.  Kaiser was recently diagnosed with severe kidney disease/failure ... [He] battled . this disease with vigor and toughness like I have never seen before.' Lebretton . explained that after the diagnosis, Kaiser's health suffered from rapid . decline, forcing his handler to make the 'heart wrenching' decision to . put him down. News of the touching send off soon went viral after a photo . of a sad-looking Kaiser being led into the animal hospital flanked by over a dozen police . officers was posted to Reddit. Kaiser, a German Shepard, was taken in to the Plymouth, Massachusetts K-9 unit at five-months old. He was put to sleep only two years later following a battle with kidney disease . Kaiser joined the Plymouth police force in March 2011 after a local family volunteered to donate the five month old pup to the department. 'I ventured to their house and was greeted by a . 5 month old German Sheperd who was more concerned with standing his . ground and protecting their beautiful 2 children then allowing us ... to greet him,' a fellow K-9 handler recounted on the social media site. Once he was adopted into the police department, Kaiser immediately formed a connection with Officer Lebretton, who at the time was still in K-9 Patrol Academy. Kaiser and his K-9 handler Officer Jamie LeBretton pose for the camera. LeBretton gave an emotional eulogy about his fallen partner on Facebook, after he was forced to put the suffering dog down . The dog went on to have an accomplished career, leaving behind tales of his 'legendary finds and the countless ass . kicking of bad guys,' the unnamed handler wrote. After the funeral Lebretton thanked the officers for their expressions of sympathy. 'Never in my career have i ever been so proud,' he said, 'You out did . yourselves today. I could not have asked for a better send off.' Seen here with his K-9 unit handlers, Kaiser, the Massachusetts police dog who recently died of kidney failure, trains to attack a criminal . Despite the dog's short time on the force Lebretton testified to the pup's love for the job. Praising the K-9 he wrote, 'Kaiser taught me more . about myself and my profession than I could have ever taught him. I . feel privileged to have had a front row seat to witness his bravery and . heroic actions.' Dozens of officers line up outside of the pet cemetery to pay tribute to Kaiser, a police dog who was put down following his battle with kidney failure . In a final eulogy on the social media site Lebretton spoke directly to his fallen furry partner writing, 'RIP my boy. I could not have asked for a . better partner or friend ... You made me a better person, a better handler, and a better cop. Till we meet again kai. I love you and will miss you daily.'","Kaiser, a German Shepard serving in the Massachusetts Police Department K-9 unit, was put down after a battle with kidney disease .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It’s cricket mating season in Oklahoma and unusually massive swarms of the frisky bugs are terrorizing the state’s residents. Not only does the field cricket have a noxious odor and shrieking chirp, it has a tendency toward cannibalism so killing them only makes things worse. Residents say the insects tend to congregate and feed on carcasses of their dead brethren, but they’re covering every street, sidewalk, and building so there’s no way to avoid the occasional crunch. Scroll down for video... They're everywhere: Unusually large swarms of crickets are invading Oklahoma, covering streets, sidewalks, and businesses like this McDonalds . Pile-up: The crickets are difficult to control, noisy, smelly and are pouring into towns across the Sooner State. Instagram user furiousd caught this particularly nasty pile of cricket carcasses . The more they’re stomped, worse infestations around homes and businesses become. ‘I think we are going to see a little more before it gets any better,’ Oklahoma State University’s Brian Jervis told KTUL. Experts say weather could be the cause of the usually large swarm. ‘These outbreaks seem to occur after periods of prolonged dry weather in spring and early summer followed by rainfall in July and August,’ said Rick Grantham, director of the Plant Disease and Insect Diagnostic Lab in Oklahoma State University. ‘Extensive soil cracking may be an important factor.’ Bad year: The crickets come out every year, but the weather allowed an unusually large number to emerge from their burrows to mate this season. Here, the critters congregate at a gas station. Unavoidable: A thick carpet of the field crickets can be found all across Oklahoma on streets, sidewalks, and buildings and stepping on them only attracts more . Cannibals: Experts say the crickets are attracted to the bodies of their dead relatives, so crushing the bugs only makes the problem worse. Here, a pile up can be seen near a shady set of stairs. 'A plague has arrived': According to Rick Grantham of Oklahoma State University's Entymology department. adult crickets can be very difficult to control . Field crickets are found throughout the Southern, Eastern, and Plains states, but Oklahoma has a special relationship with the chirping creature. At the end of every summer, the the inch-long crickets come out en masse to mate in the Sooner State. July and August rains likely trigger this emergence, but experts are saying this year's population explosion is the result of a particularly nasty drought followed by an unusually moist wet season. When residents try to squash the bugs, things can get even worse. According to Oklahoma State University's Brian Jervis, other crickets swarm the bodies of the fallen comrades for a cannibalistic feast. The current brood will eventually die off once they've all mated. But not before they've laid eggs into the ground, thus planting the seed for next year's generation. Unfortunately for Oklahoma residents, that won't happen for a while yet. Experts say this year's onslaught will likely last longer than usual and the state must still endure around 8 more weeks of the chirping plague. The crickets lay their eggs and crawl out en masse once it’s time for mating. And though the creatures can be tough to get rid of, experts suggest a few tricks that might ease the problem somewhat. ‘Crickets commonly spend the daylight hours hiding in dark, damp areas. Eliminating piles of bricks, stones, wood or other debris around the home will help reduce numbers,’ said Grantham. ‘aerosols applied to baseboards, door thresholds and cracks and crevices where crickets hide will normally control them.’ In addition to incessant chirping that can last deep into the night and early morning, some residents say the crickets even stink. 'After a while they all start dying and it gets to get this rotted meat smell,' one resident told KFOR. 'I will not be sleeping tonight': The crickets stick to walls, crunch underfoot wherever residents walk, and hang from walls and window screens, making just looking outside a little bit creepy . Invasion of crickets! 'These outbreaks seem to occur after periods of prolonged dry weather in spring and early summer followed by rainfall in July and August,' said Grantham . Thick as thieves: The crickets like to congregate in damp, cool places and experts say to remove debris that could offer such environs from around your home. 'Large amounts of crickets are gross!' says Instagram user xnebulousxz . They eventually die back, but that won’t be for another eight weeks or so. ‘I think we are going to see a little more before it gets any better,’ Jervis said. In the meantime, all residents are left to do is complain and post nauseating photos to their social media streams. Takeover: 'Crickets have taken over weatherford!!!' writes Instagram user rscarbrough13 . Creepy crawly! The bugs are teeming in Oklahoma and the problem could continue for the next eight weeks . 'Just a small glimpse': Oklahomans are accustomed to the bugs coming out once a year, but most can't remember a time when the problem was this bad . Along with up close and personal photos of their cricket experiences, Instagram users had plenty to say about the '#invasion.' 'When . I look out my window, this is what I see. Needless to say I will not be . sleeping tonight,' writes c_daaber721 with a photo of her . cricket-covered window screen. 'A plague has arrived in OKC,' writes colleendamager. Gypsyroseb asked, 'Crickets, anyone?' User xnebulousx may have siad it best: 'Large amounts of crickets are gross!' When crickets attack: The creepy crawlies blanket this Oklahoma parking lot as Instagram user rstucker185 pauses to take a pic . 'This is not okay!' The crickets aren't shy about clinging to people's homes. Experts warn homeowners to spray insect killer around doors and windows to prevent a domestic invasion . 'Crickets, anyone?'

"By . Emma Innes . A mother has defied the odds to have a baby after refusing to let doctors remove her last ovary. Sarah Muukua was told she had a cyst the size of an orange on the ovary but refused to let doctors remove it because she wanted a baby. The cafe owner was even warned by medics that the cyst could rupture, causing her to die of blood poisoning. Sarah Muukua, 31, risked her life to have baby Michael who was born in March 2013 . Despite the dangers, she refused to go ahead with the operation. As she had already had her right ovary removed three years earlier, she did not want to give up her last chance of having a baby. The life-risking decision paid off as Mrs Muukua became pregnant with son Michael weeks later while she was received counselling to help persuade her to go through with the operation. Mrs Muukua, 31, said: ‘I never thought I would conceive, let alone experience childbirth. Michael is our little miracle. ‘He is amazing. He is such a good little baby, unbelievably good and happy. ‘At the time, all the odds were against him being here but he still he made into the world. Mrs Muukua had an ovarian cyst the size of an orange but she refused to have it removed as surgeons warned her they might have to remove her only remaining ovary - meaning she couldn't have had baby Michael . Surgeons warned Mrs Muukua (pictured with Michael and husband Clemens) that the cyst could rupture putting her at risk of potentially life-threatening blood poisoning . ‘When they removed my left ovary in November 2010 it damaged my nerves in my stomach and left me with chronic pain. ‘Two years ago the pain got even worse and the doctor sent me for a scan - it showed a cyst on my left side the size of a small orange. ‘They told me they needed to remove it straight away and they gave me a consent form to sign. ‘One of the possibilities on the consent form was to remove my left ovary if they couldn’t save it. ‘I just couldn’t bring myself to sign it as it was giving up my last hope of children. Surgeons tried to persuade Mrs Muukua to have the surgery but just weeks later she discovered she was pregnant with baby Michael (pictured shortly after his birth) Mrs Muukua was so convinced she wouldn't be able to have a baby that she started looking into adoption . ‘I was in floods of tears as three different consultants and the head of gynaecology all tried to talk to me about the consequences. ‘They said if cysts rupture it can give you blood poisoning and that I was in danger of it exploding.’ Mrs Muukua and her husband Clemens, 33, had been trying for a baby for 10 years but struggled to conceive after she was plagued with ovarian cysts, fluid filled sacs which develop in a woman’s ovary. Mrs Muukua, who is a trained counsellor, talked to her family about the idea of adopting and fostering and had come to terms with never having children of her own. She added: ‘I had just got my head around it and then all of a sudden it was all turned upside down. Mrs Muukua said: 'I never thought I would conceive let alone experience childbirth. Michael is our little miracle. He is amazing. He is such a good little baby, unbelievably good and happy' ‘I started going off coffee, which I absolutely love, so I took a pregnancy test and realised I was pregnant. ‘When it showed positive I was absolutely shocked, me and Clemens were so surprised, it was on July 2. ‘I had next to zero hormones, one ovary, internal scar tissue, damage to my bowel and bladder and still managed to somehow fall pregnant. It was against all the odds. ‘The cyst had also dispersed so I no longer needed the operation.’ Mrs Muukua, from Cheltenham, had five scans during her pregnancy and numerous tests to make sure both she and her baby were fine, as well as having to have drugs to maintain her hormone levels. Michael was born on March 8 2013 weighing 7lb 10oz at Gloucester Royal Hospital.","Sarah Muukua was told she had an ovarian cyst the size of an orange .

Horrific: Robbers shot through the car windscreen when the terrified family locked themselves in . Nightmare: A friend of Berry said he had spoken to him on Sunday and was told they were having a great time . In an interview in Venezuelan magazine Panorama, she said they had remained close despite the divorce and agreed to they would still spend time together with their five-year-old daughter Maya. She said: 'It was a spectacularly civilised divorce. My friends ask me if I have suffered and are amazed because I say no. 'I married a very civilised person and when we decided to separate we decided that we would continue seeing each other with our child. 'I want him to have a good life and and he wants the same for me. I assure you there are no problems.' Armed men came up the car as the couple waited . for a repair truck, and the terrified couple locked themselves in their . Toyota Corolla. But the robbers opened fire through the windows.

Her ex-husband, an . independent travel consultant, lived in the capital . Caracas, reports El Universal. He moved to Florida for a short time after he was shot 15 years ago in a robbery that killed his friend. 'He had already been shot once by robbers trying to steal his car,' close friend Luis Dominguez told The Telegraph. 'His . friend died in the incident and although doctors saved his life, they . couldn't extract the bullet and he still had it in his stomach.' ['Mr Berry] moved to the States to get . away from things here for a while but missed Venezuela and came back,' Mr Dominguez added. He said the family had spent New Year's in the mountains of the western state of Merida then traveled to the plains.

A still from a short film showing the actress riding before she blew a kiss to the camera on the day she died . According to Telemundo, the car was already on the back of a tow truck at the time of the attack. Two tow truck drivers who had arrived to help the couple are said to be under 'intense interrogation' by police. All . the tires on the couple's car had been punctured after it hit 'a sharp . object that had been placed on the highway', director of investigative . police, Jose Gregorio Sierralta, said. Police believe the couple may have been targeted by bandits who put obstacles in the road to force victims to stop. The ploy is commonly used on the country's highways after dark. Venezuela is one the most violent places in Latin America and armed robberies, carjackings and kidnappings are rife. The annual murder rate in Caracas alone is an average of 80 murders per 100,000 people, the third highest in the world. Most . murders occur in the slums where police presence is minimal. Eastern . Caracas is home to South Americaâ€™s largest slum, named Petare with more . than two million residents, where the police to public ratio is 1 . officer to every 3,000 people.

Gun ownership is also high, with an estimated 15 million unlicensed weapons in circulation. At . least six shots are believed to have been fired, hitting Mr Berry in . the chest, his ex-wife in several places and their daughter in the leg.

'I need someone to make me feel positive, regardless of whether the relationship lasts a lifetime or not. 'It is also imperative to have a sense of humor, I love a man who makes me laugh. 'I'm super romantic and I'd like him to sing to me, to cuddle me and love me in all ways. 'That's what I live for - a fine, beautiful love.' Ms Spear's parents were flown from Florida to Venezuela by private jet, provided by Venezuela's president, so they could be with their granddaughter. 'It is the deepest pain, the deepest pain. It is unbelievable,' her father, Rafael, told the Orlando Sentinel. 'She was very charismatic, a very good daughter, a very good mother, and she loved Venezuela.' He recalled how his daughter had come to him for advice when she wanted to change from her chemical engineering course to study acting instead. 'I told her she had to decide what she wanted to do to be happy for the rest of her life,' he said. 'When my children were young, I wouldn't let them watch telenovelas, and then she began acting in soap operas, and I began watching all of hers.' Mr Dominguez, who ran an adventure tour company with the actress's ex-husband, told NBC he last spoke to Mr Berry on Sunday. 'They were having the greatest time. He said, I'll see you soon,' Mr Dominguez said. A friend of the family, Carlos Drakkar, 38, a Colombian graphic designer who lives in Caracas, said: 'This is a very difficult moment for all of us to deal with. We are doing all we can to help out friends in this difficult moment. These things happen all too often in this country. Something has to change.' Mr Berry, with his daughter Maya, 5.

"By . Jane Fryer . Hermione Norris admits that if she had the money she would go to an American plastic surgeon and get 'the lot' Hermione Norris is looking down at her chest in faux disgust. 'I want my boobs done,' she says, cupping them. 'But I just want them lifted a bit, not implants, and I don't think they do that. And I'd have my thighs tightened because all the muscle and skin tone's gone. 'And I'd have the cellulite shlooshed out of my tummy. And I'd have that wattle thing done, under my neck. 'Oh yes, and hair implants – maybe a hair transplant. If I had the money, I'd go to the best plastic surgeon in America and have the lot. I look all right in my clothes, but underneath I'm a melted candle. You wouldn't want to go there...' It's fair to say that Hermione isn't quite as I'd expected. She looks just like the cool, composed, very middle-class Karen Marsden from Cold Feet, or Spooks' tough Ros Myers, or even DCI Carol Jordan from Wire In The Blood – all sleek, beautifully fitting clothes, discreet jewellery and immaculate skin. But actually she's warm, funny, surprisingly open and brilliantly messy. 'Do you want to see the inside of my bag?' she says, grabbing an enormous soft leather tote. 'Look! There's sand, sweets, salt sachets, pens, drinks, packets of crisps, Lego, plasters. I like to be prepared and I know most things I need for all eventualities are there.' Which is all very interesting, but we're actually here to talk about The Crimson Field – a new BBC1 drama series set in a field hospital in France in the First World War, but filmed in the Cotswolds. Hermione, who's long been fascinated by the war and in her 20s made pilgrimages to the French battlefields, plays stern but compassionate Matron Grace Carter. 'It was very emotional. That level of loss – what must it have done to those poor men? To be a good nurse you'd have to have a level of  detachment. I'd just want to take them home with me. My mother's a nurse, but I couldn't do it.' The cast of Cold Feet- back row, from left, John Thomson, James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale. Front row- Hermione, Robert Bathurst, Fay Ripley . Her mother sounds more capable than most, single-handedly raising four children after her husband walked out when Hermione was just four. 'I don't know why he left – but I would imagine there was someone else involved, knowing my dad. There were four of us under six. It was really hard for my mum.' And her dad – what was he like? 'Great fun, naughty, charismatic, twinkly... trouble. He made me laugh. I saw him every Sunday. He was good at gifts and going out for nice meals but not the sort of man you should marry.' He died when Hermione was 21. 'It had a profound impact. It was really, really difficult. It was like the removal of a limb.' So Hermione immersed herself in work. 'Suddenly I was at Colchester Theatre, sharing a dressing room with a woman who drank gin out of the bottle and went on and on about her cats.' 'If I had the money, I'd go to the best . plastic surgeon in America and have the lot. I look all right in my . clothes, but underneath I'm a melted candle. You wouldn't want to go . there...' For years she alternated between theatre and anything that paid the bills – walking around shopping centres in a moose outfit and selling double glazing. Until,  in 1997, she was cast in Cold Feet, the cult ITV drama co-starring James Nesbitt, John Thomson, Fay Ripley, Robert Bathurst and Helen Baxendale. The show ran for five series and served as a launch pad for its stars, who at one stage were reputed to be being paid £70,000 each an episode. (She looks a bit blank when I mention the money today, as well she might after saying last month she now shops at Asda because British TV pays such meagre wages.) Much has been made of the differences between the cast over the years – so did they get on at all? 'We were a very eclectic group,' is her careful answer. 'A really different bunch of people. But it worked.' Are any of them still friends? 'I'm . godmother to John Thomson's little girl. And I worked with Robert . recently. And Jimmy's been away in New Zealand doing The Hobbit... With . Jimmy you always knew. I remember a helicopter arriving on set to pick . him up, and John saying, ""Oh look, there's Jimmy's career taking off,"" as the rest of us got into a minibus.' Which brings us neatly back to hair transplants and, in passing, Jimmy Nesbitt's very natural-looking new thatch. Hermione as Ros and Richard Armitage as Lucas North in Spooks . 'Jimmy's is amazing. You've got to have the cash to do it really, really well. I'm so pleased for him. As an actor it makes a difference to your castability as well.' So what about Botox? 'I would...' And has she? 'I'm not telling you! If you have surgery, don't speak about it. But I'm not against it, obviously.' It's ironic that while she played the wife with children in Cold Feet, Hermione was the last of the cast to settle down. For years, she found herself attracted to charming but unsuitable men – not unlike her father. Then in 2002, at the age of 35, she met Simon Wheeler, a writer and TV producer, when she was filming Wire In The Blood with Robson Green. They married the same year and now have a son, Wilf, nine, and daughter, Hero, six. 'I just thought, ""Oh **** it's you!"" It was very straightforward. He's kind, bright, my best friend.' At 40, he's also seven years younger than her. Is she conscious of the age gap? 'I'm sure as I get older I will be. I need that work done!' The family live in Dorset and, between filming commitments, spend their time watching mostly American DVD box sets. 'I'd absolutely love to be in an American drama, but I couldn't go over there and peddle my wares,' she says. 'I'd want them to come to me and just offer me an amazing part. I'd never have to work again and I'd be able to get my plastic surgery done then. I reckon I'd need about a quarter of a million.' Hermione is brilliant. She may have a tendency to play dauntingly capable women but she's great company. And you never know, one day, if Hollywood does finally come calling she might end up looking rather different. 'I'd see you in a few months and my boobs would be up here and I'd look amazing!' Let's just hope she leaves the hair transplants to James Nesbitt. The Crimson Field starts tomorrow at 9pm on BBC1.","Hermione Norris opens up about how she's unhappy about her body .

"By . Emma Innes . A mother nearly lost her unborn son when she underwent an invasive fertility procedure without knowing she was pregnant. Natalie Birkett, 35, had her womb and fallopian tubes flushed with dye by doctors investigating why she and her husband Chris, 43, had not been able to conceive after three years of trying. The receptionist, from Goodmayes, north east London, discovered three weeks later she had been four weeks pregnant at the time of the test. Natalie and Chris Birkett nearly lost their son, Ethan, when Mrs Birkett had an invasive fertility procedure . Doctors, who before going ahead with the fertility test had ordered a pregnancy test which returned a negative result, told Mrs Birkett they would have expected the dye to have flushed the foetus from her body. Against the odds, Mrs Birkett’s son Ethan developed to full term and next month he will be two years old. Mrs Birkett said: ‘I often think of how close we came to losing Ethan. Part of me still can’t believe he survived and how lucky we are.’ Mrs Birkett and her husband, a television presenter and actor, began trying for a child a year after they married in 2007. She said: ‘For the first year of trying we weren’t in any particular rush - we were too busy enjoying our relationship. But when another year went by and we still didn’t have any luck, I started to think things were seriously wrong. ‘When I was 21 I’d been told I probably had polycystic ovary syndrome but I hadn’t thought much of it. Now I wondered whether it was going to be an impossible barrier to overcome.’ Mr and Mrs Birkett had been trying for a baby for three years without success so decided to have a procedure in which Mrs Birkett's womb and fallopian tubes were flushed to remove any blockages . Mrs Birkett took a pregnancy test before she underwent the procedure but it came back negative. As a result, she didn't know she was pregnant with Ethan when she had the surgery . In August 2011 Mrs Birkett was offered a fertility test through a gynaecological laparoscopy under general anaesthetic at Whipps Cross University Hospital in London. Before undergoing the test, during which dye would be sent through her womb and fallopian tubes to detect and dislodged any blockages, she was given a pregnancy test. She said: ‘I didn’t think there was a lot of point in taking a test - we’d been trying to conceive for years with no luck. So when the test said I was negative I wasn’t surprised.’ She was told to rest in bed for two weeks, after which she developed some familiar symptoms. She said: ‘I felt nauseous and had been fainting. My mum wondered whether I was pregnant and although I laughed her words off at first, it must have had an effect because I took another test. Doctors were amazed that Ethan survived the procedure unharmed as they thought he would have been washed out of his mother's womb by the dye that was flushed through it . Mrs Birkett only realised she was pregnant when she started feeling sick and faint and her mother suggested that she should take a pregnancy test . ‘When the result came back as positive, I was overcome with joy. I screamed with happiness so loudly that my husband thought I’d fallen down the stairs.’ But the joy was short-lived when a prenatal doctor warned her the dye procedure could have damaged her unborn son. Mrs Birkett said: ‘I had to wait another five weeks until my 12 week scan, when we would find out if my baby was alright. ‘We knew the baby had survived, but we didn’t know whether there would be complications. No-one knew whether the dye had affected the foetus. Mrs Birkett said: 'I often think of how close we came to losing Ethan. Part of me still can't believe he survived and how lucky we are' Mrs Birkett said: 'When the [pregnancy test] came back as positive, I was overcome with joy. I screamed with happiness so loudly that my husband thought I'd fallen down the stairs' ‘At first I wondered whether there had been a mix-up with the pregnancy test which was ordered before the dye flushing, but that possibility was discounted. My only thought was that my hormones weren’t at the right levels at the previous test.’ Such fertility tests, performed with keyhole surgery, are quite common and often result in increased fertility among patients because blockages are removed from the reproductive system as the dye makes its way through the body. Before the tests medics are careful to order pregnancy tests to protect undetected foetuses from being flushed away. Ethan is about to celebrate his second birthday and his parents say they 'love him to bits' Mrs Birkett (pictured with her husband on the day they met) said: 'Me and Chris are both loud, upbeat people, and Ethan is like both of us combined. He's always on the go' Amazingly, the 12-week scan was fine and little Ethan was born on April 19, 2012. Mrs Birkett said: ‘Me and Chris are both loud, upbeat people, and Ethan is like both of us combined. He’s always on the go and we love him to bits. ‘Getting to Mother’s Day this year was joyous. ‘Behind everything we do as a family is the knowledge of the struggles we went through to have a baby.’","Natalie and Chris Birkett had tried for a baby for three years .

"By . Ted Thornhill . An obsessive bodybuilder who suffered two heart attacks and three strokes because of his massive intake of anabolic steroids died aged just 20 after ignoring repeated warnings to stop working out, an inquest heard. Fitness fanatic Oli Cooney had been told by doctors when he was 18 that he was putting his life at risk if he did not limit his weightlifting but he refused to listen - and told family he was ‘invincible’. Oli was openly taking anabolic steroids because he wanted to change his body image and had been working out since he was 16, his grandmother Janet Brook told a hearing in Bradford, West Yorkshire. Boast: Mr Cooney told his family that he was 'invincible' Treatment: Mr Cooney at Bradford Royal infirmary in 2013 . Tragic: Mr Cooney had been working out since he was 16 and took an ultimately lethal quantity of steroids . Mr Cooney, of Baildon, West Yorkshire, who was also taking physique enhancing supplements including milk thistle, had been diagnosed with chronic heart damage after attending hospital with chest pains. He had stopped taking the anabolic steroids but the irreversible and long-term damage to his heart had already been done. Despite having two heart attacks and three strokes, which left him with weakness down one side and without speech for a time, he responded well to physiotherapy. But he returned to working out at the gym three or four times a week, despite the warnings by doctors. Warning: Mr Cooney suffered two heart attacks and three strokes, one of which left him with speech problems . Bodybuilder: Oli Cooney pictured relaxing during Christmas celebrations with his family in 2012 . Teenage years: Mr Cooney at work aged 16 (left) and aged 14 while on holiday in Tunisia in 2006 . Younger days: Oli aged 16 with his sisters Lucy, 11, and Ashlee, four. The photograph was taken in 2008 . As well as potentially lethal conditions such as heart attacks and strokes, taking steroids regularly can lead to a range of physical side effects in men and women, according to the NHS website. In men they include:Reduced sperm countInfertility Shrunken testiclesBaldness Breast developmentIncreased risk of developing prostate cancerSplayed teeth and overgrowth of the forehead (giving an 'Incredible Hulk' appearance)Severe acneWomenFacial hair growth and body hairLoss of breastsSwelling of the clitoris A deepened voiceAn increased sex driveProblems with periodsHair lossSevere acne . Source: NHS . He told a nurse he would rather have another heart attack than another stroke because of the effect a stroke would have on his body. Recording a verdict that Mr Cooney's death was from substance abuse of anabolic steroids, Assistant Bradford Coroner Dr Dominic Bell told Mr Cooney's family they were not to blame themselves. He said: ‘He had this weakness that he was driven to alter his body image to become more confident in society. ‘For most people what had already happened to him would have been a wake-up call but he was not willing to listen to or learn from the heart professionals. ‘If he would not listen to them, he would not listen to you - it does not reflect any shortfall on you.’ The hearing was told by health professionals how Mr Cooney had seemed to be in some denial about his serious heart condition and its consequences. He had also insisted on continuing to take bulking-up supplements, although he would always get them checked out first with medics. On September 22 last year Mr Cooney, who worked at a convenience store in Baildon, had been on his way home in a taxi after a night out when he stopped off at a friend's house in Bradford. He was running back to the taxi a few minutes later when he collapsed. He was pronounced dead shortly after he was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary. After the inquest, Mr Cooney's parents, Simon and Sarah Cooney, said they wanted their son's death to drive home the message that steroids can kill. Mrs Cooney said: ‘Oli was driven by a passion for bodybuilding and unfortunately it was that passion that took his life. We would not want anyone to go through the hell we have been through. We will never move on from this.’ Most body builders inject anabolic steroids directly into the muscle, but they can also be swallowed in tablet form or absorbed into the body through the skin via a cream or gel, according to the NHS.

"By . Emma Innes . A mother has credited her baby daughter with saving her life after doctors discovered a deadly heart condition when she went into hospital to give birth. Samantha McRoberts, 29, arrived at hospital for a scheduled Caesarean delivery of her third child, Marley. But she struggled to stay conscious in the aftermath of the delivery and emergency tests confirmed she had a seriously weakened heart valve which could have failed at any time. Samantha McRoberts believes baby Marley saved her life because she discovered after the birth that she had a potentially deadly heart condition that needed immediate teratment . When she was pregnant with Marley, Miss McRoberts was very breathless and ill but she was told it was normal . She said: ‘If I hadn’t been in hospital at that time, and under those circumstances, then my heart condition might never have been discovered. ‘I thank Marley for saving my life - if it wasn’t for her, I don’t know if I would be here today.’ Miss McRoberts, a supermarket worker from Bracknell, discovered she was pregnant with Marley in the summer of 2012. She said: ‘My partner Chris and I were delighted when we found out. We couldn’t wait to have another child together. ‘I suffered with very bad sickness from an early stage of the pregnancy. I spent entire days in the bathroom, near the toilet. ‘But more worrying than that was the fact I was also quite out of breath, so I decided to ask my doctor about it.’ Marley was delivered by C-section but after the delivery Miss McRoberts started drifting in and out of consciousness. Her heart then stopped numerous times and a crash team had to battle to save her life . Concerned, Miss McRoberts visited her GP who reassured her that her breathlessness and sickness were the results of an infection and the fact she was asthmatic. She said: ‘It was a struggle but the C-section was booked for the following February, so I had something to focus on. I battled through my discomfort.’ Miss McRoberts had a severely damaged mitral valve. This valve separates the upper left heart chamber from the lower left heart chamber and helps control blood flow through the heart. Problems with the valve can make the heart less efficient at pumping blood around the body. Severe problems with the valve can lead to heart failure. To prevent this, surgery is required to replace or repair the valve. This operation usually involves cutting down the middle of the breastbone to access the heart. Surgeons can then repair the valve or replace it with one made from animal tissue. Source: NHS Choices . But there were troubling signs from the . moment Miss McRoberts was given a spinal block after arriving at . hospital for the delivery. She said: ‘As the anaesthetic began to work I felt deathly ill. My memory is patchy, but I have a clear image of Chris standing over me, urging me to keep calm. 'My heart rate was fluctuating but the doctors and midwives managed to stabilise me.’ She was able to enjoy a moment of happiness as Marley was placed on her chest following the delivery, but the calm was abruptly shattered when her vital signs suddenly crashed. She said: ‘The doctors rushed around me and I was aware of voices asking me to stay awake as I dipped in and out of consciousness.’ Waking up three hours later, doctors gave a shocking assessment - her heart had stopped several times and at some points she had been just seconds from death. It was only the quick thinking of the crash team which had saved her life. A detailed scan revealed one of her heart valves had been practically destroyed. A bout of rheumatic fever she suffered as a child was identified as the probable cause. It was thought that the strain of the pregnancy with her daughter had been too much for her heart. She said: ‘I already had a son, Harvey, who’s now four, with Chris, and I had a daughter Summer, now eight, from a previous relationship, so it was a mystery why I hadn’t suffered through those previous pregnancies. ‘The only certainty was that I was lucky I was in hospital when it happened - if it hadn’t have been for Marley, I would have died.’ Tests revealed Miss McRoberts had a severely damaged heart valve which could fail at any time . Misss McRoberts (pictured with Marley and partner, Chris) had to have open heart surgery to replace the valve . Shaken, Miss McRoberts was confronted with the news that she needed open heart surgery to repair her damaged valve. She said: ‘The thought of leaving my children without a mother was enough to motivate me. Although the heart surgery would be risky, I needed to make sure I would be around for them in the future, and surgery was the only way.’ Thankfully, the operation to replace the valve in July 2013 was a success and she was able to return home to her family. Miss McRoberts is now back at home and celebrating Marley's first birthday (pictured) She said: ‘For the first few months of Marley’s life I was ordered to have lots of bed rest. I was so weak I couldn’t even pick her up, so there were moments when I wondered whether it would affect me bonding with her. ‘Chris was absolutely amazing, and took over all the duties for night feeds and changing nappies.’ Marley turned one last month and Miss McRoberts is now fully recovered from surgery. She said: ‘I needn’t have worried about not bonding with her - we’re as close as we could be. I feel so proud of my whole family for coping with what I’ve been through. ‘I’m particularly proud of Marley, because without her I wouldn’t be here.’","Samantha McRoberts was very breathless and ill during her pregnancy .

Jayne Saunders, 48, is alleged to have ‘failed to deal appropriately’ with the teenage girl’s wish to mark her birthday with a sleepover at the hospice for terminally-ill children. The parents of the 14-year-old girl said Mrs Saunders ‘rolled her eyes’ when discussing the request. Jayne Saunders, director of Ty Hafan Children's Hospice, in South Wales, is accused of rolling her eyes at a teenage girls' dying wish to mark her birthday with a sleepover . Her plea to have a sleepover at the hospice with her school friends turned out to be her final birthday wish. It is alleged Mrs Saunders gave insufficient consideration to the feelings of the young girl - who was bedridden and dying of leukaemia. Presenting officer Barnaby Hone said: ‘She had broken her leg and was limited in where she could go. ‘The only place suitable for care was Ty Hafan hospice. She was dying and it was clear that she was a terminal patient.’ The teenage girl spent her last days at the hospice between February and April 2008 to receive end-of-life care for leukaemia. The girl’s parents claim Mrs Saunders said she ‘couldn’t have 14-year-old girls running up and down the corridor’ in the hospice. Mrs Saunders is accused of 'failing to deal appropriately' with the patient's request (image shows the hospice) The young girl was eventually given her birthday sleepover after a risk assessment by the hospice staff. A Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing in Cardiff was told Mrs Saunders was director of care at Ty Hafan Children’s Hospice at Sully, South Wales, whose patron is Prince Charles. It is also alleged Mrs Saunders gave the dying teenage girl a ‘blank ultimatum’ to allow regular sensitive examinations by hospice staff or face being kicked out. Mr Hone said: ‘She was left with the decision that if she did not have those checks she had to leave. The 14-year-old was eventually allowed to have a sleepover and she died of leukaemia shortly afterwards . ‘The management of Ty Hafan knew she had no other place to go.’ Mrs Saunders joined Ty Hafan Children’s Hospice in 1998 as clinical team leader and became director of care in 2006. She denies all allegations of professional misconduct. The hearing continues.","Jayne Saunders is accused of 'failing to deal appropriately' with request .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A doctor who was the the first to climb the highest mountains on every continent has survived a  brain hemorrhage because of his hobby. Dr Alistair Sutcliffe is only alive because his body had become used to being starved of oxygen at heights of up to 30,000ft. Being at such high altitudes had forced open an artery that normally closes down at birth. Had it not been open, he would have died. Dr Alistair Sutcliffe is only alive today because his body had become used to being starved of oxygen at heights of up to 30,000ft . Dr Sutcliffe at the summit of Mount Vinson - the highest mountain in Antarctic. Being at such high altitudes had forced open an artery that normally closes down at birth. Had it not been open, he would have died . After successfully summiting the seven highest mountains of the world, he was suddenly struck by the subarachnoid brain haemorrhage, and his family was told he would not survive. But despite going into a coma as his body began to shut down, Dr Sutcliffe saved his own life in an extraordinary twist of fate. The 49-year-old said: 'I suddenly felt an odd fast-creeping spasm over my lower neck. 'The neck pain moved swiftly to head pain and I began to fear I was having a brain haemorrhage. 'My vision was affected, most things appeared hazy, and I thought I was going to die.' Dr Sutcliffe’s interest in mountain climbing began aged 11, when he met Chris Bonington - the first British person to successfully summit Mount Everest. Dr Sutcliffe on the Khumbu Icefall on Mount Everest - the most dangerous part of the climb.  After successfully summiting the seven highest mountains of the world, he was suddenly struck by the subarachnoid brain haemorrhage, and his family was told he would not survive . Within seven years, he made it to the top of Mont Blanc, Aconcagua, Vinson, Denali, Everest, Kilimanjaro, Elbrus and the Carstensz Pyramid, before facing his hardest climb to date - fighting for survival. 'From the minute I met Chris Bonington I was hooked,' he said. 'It made me want to know what it felt like to stand on top of the world and how people can get so high without being in a plane. 'I thought to myself, one day I want to answer those questions. 'I climbed Mont Blanc in France in 2002 and went on to climb the highest mountains in the world over the next five years.' Dr Sutcliffe with his wife Claire. He said: 'I suddenly felt an odd fast-creeping spasm over my lower neck' During his explorations around the world, Dr Sutcliffe, from Whitby, North Yorkshire, endured sub-zero temperatures, watched climbers fall to their death coming and was even held at gunpoint. He said: 'It was now or never for Everest, but we picked the worst year for fatalities. Seventeen people died, and three of those were on a trek an hour ahead of us. 'It was actually the morning that we left an hour late or we would have been caught up with them. 'On another climb, we were taken hostage for 13 hours on a bus floor as raiders tried to extract as much money from us as possible. At the summit of Elbrus in Russia. Dr Sutcliffe's interest in mountain climbing began aged 11, when he met Chris Bonington - the first British person to successfully summit Mount Everest . 'They would have shot us if we had tried to move, but we did what they said until they let us go.' But his toughest challenge was yet to come, and it was thanks to his gruelling crusades to date that saved him from death. 'I had a brain haemorrhage which should have killed me, but a blood vessel opened which ultimately saved my life,' said Dr. Sutcliffe. 'Had it not been open, it would have just burst. Most people would have died within 20 minutes, but my brain had become used to coping with as little as 40 per cent oxygen. “My brain had been stressed and the blood vessel reopened. Rather than the brain being cut off, it was directed to the areas that needed the blood and most of the functions regained. Dr Sutcliffe climbing Everest. He said: 'If I had not been climbing, my brain would not have developed an extra vessel, so I would have died' 'Altitude does odd things to the body. Oxygen deprivation occurs noticeably above six thousand feet, producing an aching in the muscle tissues and a streaming cold similar to a mild influenza. “Exercising and breathing feels constrained, as if you have a plastic bag over your head, but in the long run these are the things that saved my life. 'If I had not been climbing, my brain would not have developed an extra vessel so I would have died.' With a medical background, Dr Sutcliffe realised he was having a brain hamorrhage and called his surgeon wife Clare, 41. After arriving at hospital, he called his parents to say goodbye before drifting into a coma. Earlier this year awarded the British Empire Medal by the Queen for his bravery and skill . Dr Sutcliffe said: 'I could hear the consultant and I could hear what was going on around me - they were telling my family I was going to die and discussing organ donation with Clare. 'They found out it was a tumour which usually ends in death, and when I awoke from the coma I lost my sight, which they said was likely never to return. 'Luckily after about six hours it did, but as I was recovering I was so worried about losing my memory and forgetting about my amazing experiences so I decided to write them down.' Dr Sutcliffe has since written a book about his mountain climbing and the medical miracle that saved his life - titled The Hardest Climb. Dr Sutcliffe (pictured right at At the summit of the Carstensz Pyramid, Indonesia) said: 'I have no idea how I got my medal, but I am incredibly honoured. Someone must have nominated me' And, earlier this year awarded the British Empire Medal by the Queen for his bravery and skill.

"By . Binky Felstead . Honestly! You'd think I'd have grown out of celebrity crushes by now, wouldn't you? OK, I no longer stick posters of boy band hunks on my bedroom wall, but my fascination for famous faces remains. Despite the fact that I now get targeted by paparazzi photographers and even sign the occasional autograph, I still love celebrity gossip and I'm obsessed with Hollywood fashion and beauty. My latest superstar style crush is Mila Kunis, the gorgeous actress and girlfriend of Ashton Kutcher. Famed for her glossy brunette locks and sultry beauty, I think she's incredible, so for this week's blog I decided to recreate her signature smoky-eyed glamour. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This week Binky shows you how to achieve Mila's signature smokey eye . GET THE MILA LOOK . DO YOUR PREP . Prep your face with foundation and powder for that flawless Hollywood complexion, followed by a light coverage of Too Faced Shadow Insurance Eyeshadow Primer on the eyelids. This creates a perfect even canvas for colours, as well as fixing eye make-up in place and preventing eyeshadow creases. POWER BROWS . Mila has fabulously strong, dark brows so use the dark brown eyeshadow shade from the Daniel Sandler Eyeshadow Quad in Beyond Sunset to emphasise your own. Simply follow the natural line of your brows, applying colour with a small, angled brush. Binky recommends using a primer to fully prep your face in order to prevent makeup from slipping . LUXE LIDS . Next, using a larger brush, blend the nude/brown shade from the Daniel Sandler palette across your lids, creating a subtle base of pretty colour and adding depth to the eyes. Going back to the darker brown shade, add a stronger wash of colour at the corners of your lids, winging it out towards your brows, along the lower lash line and around the eye. Next up, apply the sparkly grey-brown shade from the same palette along your upper and lower lash lines, using a small, angled brush. Finally, apply the glistening golden shade from the Daniel Sandler palette to the centre of your lid. This look calls for quite a lot of colour on your eyes, so the key is to blend carefully so each shade merges subtly into the next. Binky says it's important to blend your eyeshadow so that one shade merges into the next . FINE LINES . Now draw a dark eyeliner along your upper and lower lash lines, and inside the water line - I used Clarins Crayon Kohl Long-Lasting Eye Pencil in Intense Black. This will emphasise your eyes and really strengthen that dark, smoky-eyed effect. Finish up with lashings of Too Faced Lash Injection mascara to really finesse your eye make-up. LA GLOW . A Binky look has to include bronzer - even if it's a Mila Kunis-influenced Binky look! Take a large fluffy brush and swish it across both shades in the Daniel Sandler Sculpt & Slim Contour Kit, then apply the colour anywhere the sun would hit your face. Next brush a soft, shimmery blusher across the apples of your cheeks - I used Guerlain Blush Duo in Peach Boy - to add a healthy Californian glow to your complexion. A PERFECT POUT . The focus of this look is the sultry eyes, so I've taken a tip from Mila's book and stuck to a nude lip colour. Apply Guerlain Rouge Automatique Lipstick straight from the tube and smudge your lips together to achieve a soft, neutral finish. I reckon this a gorgeous result, one Mila Kunis herself would be proud of! If there's a Hollywood star whose hair or make-up look you'd like to recreate, just drop me a line and I'll try to help out. You'll find all the products I've used today at online beauty boutique escentual.com. The focus of this look is sultry eyes so Binky recommends keeping to subtle colours for your lips . On another note, I’m currently testing my willpower by taking part in the Decafflon launched by Emmi . CAFFÈ LATTE . Decaff – it’s a challenge encouraging the nation to give up caffeine for 10 days. So far, so good…I’ve replaced my usual coffee with the tasty new Emmi CAFFÈ LATTE Decaff and have been exercising first thing in the morning to kick-start my metabolism. If you fancy attempting the Decafflon yourself (which I highly recommend!) you can find out more info here: www.facebook.com/emmicaffelatteuk . Until next time, stay gorgeous! Love Binky xxx . PS. Huge thanks to the gorgeous Marie Selby who helped me recreate Mila Kunis' look. She's an amazing make-up artist and also does eyelashes, hair extensions & teeth whitening! Check her site out here girls: www.hairmakeupbeauty.co.uk .","This week Binky is channeling the smoky-eyes of Mila Kunis .

"By . Patrick Collins . Sam Allardyce lingered by the touchline, his hand theatrically cupped to his ear as the boos and jeers came tumbling from the main stand at Upton Park. He attempted a mocking smile but he could not disguise his confusion. It was a curiously compelling image. A few moments earlier, West Ham had completed a fortuitous win over a Hull City side which had played for more than an hour with 10 men. But a win is a win, three points are three points. As the perplexed manager put it: ‘I’ve never been in a place where we have won and got booed. I couldn’t believe it.’ It was a pity that he wasn’t around to hear the call which a gentleman named Simon made to Radio 5 Live shortly afterwards. Simon, it seems, has been a West Ham season-ticket holder for more than 30 years. He sounded informed, reasonable and thoroughly exasperated. Can't hear you: Sam Allardyce was booed despite West Ham beating Hull on Wednesday . On the up: Mark Noble scored the opening goal against Hull as they pulled clear of the relegation zone . He acknowledged that, as a West Ham fan, he didn’t expect to win titles or trophies. But he did expect something better than this. ‘It’s just the turgidness of the performance,’ he said. ‘It’s £42 to get into each game, sometimes more, depending on the opposition, and it’s just  boring. This is the most turgid, boring side. If I wasn’t a West Ham supporter and you gave me a ticket, I wouldn’t watch it. It’s so one-dimensional. It’s just awful  to watch.’ He appreciated that there are only so many good players to go around the English game. But he explained: ‘If you can’t get your head up and buy yourself a little bit of time, if you haven’t got the quality to do that and play simple 10-yard passes, if the only thing you’ve got is a smash-up ball to Andy Carroll, well...! And you want me to pay £42 to watch it!’ There is a patronising assumption that football fans are unconcerned with frivolous qualities such as touch, technique and  imagination. They want grafters, scrappers, uncomplicated battlers. And certainly it is much easier to hire muscular journeymen than to develop  creative artists. And yet, when they are offered something more adventurous, more demanding, they may react with enthusiastic approval.  Consider the work done by Brendan Rodgers at Swansea and now Liverpool. Or the way in which Roberto Martinez operated at Swansea and now Everton. Or the influence of Mauricio Pochettino at Southampton. Not one of these men could have  tolerated the kind of scowling, intimidating sides which Allardyce churned out at Bolton, briefly at Newcastle, at Blackburn and now at West Ham. Flair: Mauricio Pochettino (left) at Southampton and Roberto Martinez (right) at Everton are more adventurous . Exciting: Everton have passed their way into fifth place and a possible spot in the Champions League . In truth, at each place he found a degree of approval, especially in the early days. But as time went on, his joyless pragmatism provoked precisely the same kind of reaction which Simon articulated the other evening. Yet  disapproval will scarcely dent Allardyce’s self-esteem. This, after all, is the man who criticised the influence of foreign managers on the English scene and famously declared that he would have been offered the England job if his name had been ‘Allardici’. Equally celebrated was his  contention that he wasn’t much suited to the likes of Bolton or Blackburn. ‘I would be more suited to Inter Milan or Real Madrid,’ he mused. ‘It wouldn’t be a problem for me to manage those clubs because I would win the Double or the league every time. Give me Manchester United or Chelsea and I would do the same. It wouldn’t be a problem.’ And even as we mocked his shameless self- delusion, we marvelled at his ability to persuade people to offer him lucrative employment, equip him with a handsome transfer budget and entrust him with the future of their football club. Not pretty: Allardyce spent £15million on Andy Carroll . Which is why we find the man who paid £15million for Andy Carroll pacing the dugout at Upton Park, watching the ball being battered high and hopeful, occasionally stepping on a sign which proclaims the place: ‘The Academy of Football’. The boos and jeers are growing louder as the prevailing ugliness is emphatically rejected but Allardyce cannot comprehend, much less sympathise with, the disapproval. For in his world, ends justify means. Or, as he has frequently observed: ‘We are in a results business.’ It is an unthinking cliché. It is also quite mistaken. The National Lottery is a ‘results business’, likewise the Stock Exchange. Football is something quite different. Its appeal was defined most beautifully by a dreamer named Danny Blanchflower. ‘The game is about glory,’ he said. ‘It is about doing things in style, with a flourish, about going out and beating the other lot, not waiting for them to die of boredom.’ In a couple of sentences, Danny distilled all the charm, the wonder, the timeless appeal of the game he loved so well. I can imagine Sam Allardyce listening to those words with his hand cupped to his ear; smiling his mocking smile, and failing to conceal his abject confusion. R&A pompous and blinkered to the bitter end . On Thursday, September 18, the members of the Royal & Ancient Golf Club of  St Andrews may decide to admit women to their ranks. In the year of grace 2014, that opening sentence seems a ludicrous anachronism. But when Peter Dawson, the chief executive of the R&A, can commend the move by reflecting that ‘society is changing, sport is changing’, then truly we are living in revolutionary times. If club ties and brass-buttoned blazers could speak, then  they would sound just  like Dawson. For year after year he has defended the exclusion of women by mumbling the same, fatuous mantra: ‘There’s no particular pressure from inside golf about this but the media clearly have it on their agenda. It’s not an issue people talk to me about  very much.’  In short, it is  just a conspiracy of ‘the chattering classes’. Progress: Peter Dawson has commended the move to allow women into the R&A . So the R&A continued their 260-year-old custom of denying membership to more than half the population of the planet, while awarding the Open Championship to clubs — Muirfield, Royal Troon, Royal St George’s — who operate the same indefensible policy. So what has brought about this tectonic shift? We may discount considerations such as conscience, morality and an awareness of their own absurdity. No, they have been pushed by commercial and political pressures, as well as the powerful Olympic movement, which recently adopted golf as an Olympic sport and now requires it to behave in a civilised manner. Regrettably, neither the  R&A nor its chief executive are quite ready to embrace the 21st century. Dawson refuses to give an assurance that men-only clubs will never again stage an Open. And, astonishingly, he is allowing the members’ vote to clash with the Scottish independence referendum. He explains: ‘It is enshrined in our constitution that the business meeting takes place the day before the last day  of Autumn Medal week.’ It is unwittingly hilarious,  a classic case of blinkered pomposity. Quite frankly, the women can’t get there soon enough. P.S. Dean Ryan coaches Worcester Rugby Union club. On Sunday they visit Newcastle for an Aviva Premiership match. Worcester have had a difficult season but is their coach downhearted? Not at all. ‘Despite being 12 points adrift at the foot of the table, I feel we’re in  a good place,’ he declares. Worcester may yet survive but, even if the worst happens, then Mr Ryan should not worry. Instead, he should look beyond the oval-ball game. A coach capable of delivering a line like that would stroll into any job the Premier League has to offer.","Disgruntled West Ham fans will not affect Sam Allardyce .

"By . Monty Don . PUBLISHED: . 16:30 EST, 4 April 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:30 EST, 4 April 2014 . April is when rocket is at its very best. Most of the rocket that is sold in supermarkets or dished up in a restaurant is the perennial wild rocket, Diplotaxis, with its slender, finely indented leaves. It’s good - I grow it with enthusiasm - but nothing compared to well-grown sweet rocket, Eruca sativa, eaten fresh from the garden. I harvest rocket almost daily for nine months of the year, between the beginning of September and the end of June and at any one time will have two or even three crops on the go. In practice the plants are perennial and a friend of mine in London has some in a container that she has kept for the past five years. Monty says that April is the month when Rocket is at its very best . But I treat them as annuals and if you taste rocket in spring at its best you will always be searching for that melting, spicy succulence that no other season can provide. Q. My Pyracantha 'Mohave Silver' has never flowered or  had berries. Where  am I going wrong? Pam Wightman, Birmingham . A. Pyracantha flowers on wood grown the previous year, so are you pruning it too drastically? Shade reduces flowering too. Q. My garden is overrun with Allium triquetrum. How can I eradicate it? Mrs Pamela Reynolds, Portland, Dorset . A. Allium triquetrum is known as wild garlic (as is the more common Allium ursinum), and every part of the plant is delicious to eat – it makes excellent pesto. It can be very invasive, though, especially in damp shade. Eat as much as possible and cut the  top growth to weaken next year's bulbs. Q. I have two large blue agapanthus, grown from seed many years ago.  Should I cut the leaves back each year or let them die back naturally? Mrs Sheila King, Bexleyheath, Kent . A. You should never cut back agapanthus. The foliage of herbaceous agapanthus will die back each autumn, whereas evergreen types will retain their leaves. It is important to water well after flowering and feed weekly to ensure good flowering the following year. As a rule all agapanthus flower best when their roots are restrained, so repotting will often stop flowering for a  few years until the roots have grown. It is very happy growing in an unheated greenhouse and although the taste of the winter leaves is welcome enough when there are few other fresh salad leaves, they are only half as good as their spring cousins. After radish - to which it is related, both being members of the Brassica family - it is the easiest of all seeds to germinate. I suggest sowing it any time between January and May or July and September. Chuck the seeds out onto any old soil or compost and they will grow. But the crucial thing is to thin boldly and transplant them early. Rocket seeds are biggish and reasonably easy to handle so I now sprinkle two or three per plug, wait until at least two germinate successfully and then ruthlessly thin down to one healthy seedling. These can then be grown on and hardened off until they are about two or three inches tall before planting out at 15cm (6in) spacing. You can easily sow them direct but they will still need fierce thinning. This will seem ridiculously generous with space but closer spacing does not result in any greater harvest of the leaves and as the widely spaced plants have lots of nutrition and water, they are much healthier and last longer. I start picking leaves as soon as they are large enough to handle and expect to make three or four pickings from each plant over as many months. The leaves can vary hugely in size and shape with some having no indentation other than an odd crinkle and others scooped back to the stem. In my experience taste is not affected. Rocket does not like very hot weather and needs rich soil with plenty of water to be at its best. A damp spring and cool summer suits it admirably. But usually by the middle of May the plants are starting to bolt and flower, growing a thick, hairy stem with fewer and hotter leaves. The flowers are perfectly edible and the summer seeds provide all of next year’s crop. Slugs will nibble at very young seedlings but tend to leave them alone once they start growing vigorously. A much greater problem is the flea beetle, which will pinprick each leaf with innumerable small holes, each of which will create a scarring, toughening reaction. As a consequence, taste and all-round plant health suffers. But the life cycle of the flea beetle coincides with the plant’s most urgent desire to reproduce and set seed, so around the middle of June I leave a few plants to set seed and pull up the rest and have a rocketless season over high summer. But that only serves to whet my appetite and new seeds are sown in early August ready for harvest from early September, and another sowing at the end of the month provides plants to grow under glass for our winter supply.","Monty says that April is when Rocket is at its best .

But, as a new TV series and book reveal, it owes much to a formidable woman - his mother, Daisy. The most provocative and influential garden of recent times, Great Dixter has anticipated many of the gardening trends of the past 50 years - wildflower meadows, tropical-style gardens and successional planting, where flowers appear in a continuous wave from spring until autumn. Associated today with Christopher Lloyd, the enfant terrible of British horticulture, the garden was originally created by his parents, with the help of the great Edwardian architect Edwin Lutyens. The Long Border at Great Dixter, Northiam during the early Summer months . Nathaniel and Daisy Lloyd bought Great Dixter in 1910 and Christo, as he was always known, was born there in 1921. When Nathaniel died in 1933, Daisy took control of the garden and for the next four decades presided over it with an iron trowel. Although Christo would later be credited with popularising the meadow style, it was Daisy who first introduced it to Dixter, transforming the rough grass in front  of the house into a tapestry of wild flowers. Dixter's famous Long Border was also Daisy's creation. Daisy was known to her family as 'the management' and she cultivated her six children with the same obsessive zeal as she cultivated her six-acre garden. Great Dixter, Daisy with a young Christo . She taught them the Latin names of plants and tested them ruthlessly on plant identification, sending the five boys weekly bundles of fresh flowers when they were at boarding school. Christo was the most biddable of her children, and also painfully shy. Even as a grown man he was happy to spend almost all his time with his mother. After a spell as a lecturer in horticulture, Christo returned to Dixter, and to Daisy, in 1954. Now with only three gardeners - originally there had been nine - he and Daisy opened a plant nursery to supplement their income. Daisy died in 1972, aged 91; deprived of his main companion, Christo blossomed socially and Dixter became famous for its jolly weekend parties, full of enthusiastic horticulturists. Relieved of the constraints of fashion and taste after his mother's death, Christo could experiment in the garden at will. His most famous and  controversial alteration after Daisy's death was to dig up the 80-year-old Rose Garden and transform it into an Exotic Garden. Here, lush foliage like hardy bananas and the huge elephant's ear, Colocasia esculenta, were mixed with brightly coloured late-summer plants including dahlias, cannas, salvias and begonias. This caused outrage and, like a naughty child, he delighted in the furore, describing the sound of the rose roots being ripped from the earth as 'music to my ears'. The vibrant colours and textured leaves in the Exotic Garden at Great Dixter, Northiam, Sussex during the late Summer into Autumn . Predictably, despite the controversy, Christo's Exotic Garden began a trend for exotic planting that continues to this day. Shortly before his death in 2006, Christo set up a charitable trust that has ensured Great Dixter is still open to the public. The garden continues to evolve, but the spirit of Daisy and Christo lives on there. It is still a place full of surprises.

"By . Simon Jones . Inter Milan watched Patrice Evra on Wednesday night as they consider an offer for the Manchester United left-back. Inter's technical director Piero Ausilio was in attendance at The Emirates Stadium for the 0-0 draw with Arsenal in the knowledge that France international Evra is out of contract in the summer. He has interest from Monaco and Paris St Germain, however, the Italians are rebuilding their squad and also see the 32-year-old as a good free signing. Eye on the ball: Patrice Evra in action for United against Arsenal . Evra has the same agent as United winger Luis Nani, who Inter tried to sign in January, and they have been alerted to the fact the defender is considering a fresh challenge. Inter have already made a proposal to Evra's teammate Nemanja Vidic as they look to take the United captain on a two year contract with the option for a third year at the end of the season and the combative Serbian is believed to be close to an agreement. Inter have Nani as a possibility in mind for the summer still but remain keen on Tottenham's Erik Lamela too if Daniel Levy will countenance a sale or loan. United are continuing to evaluate new left-backs of their own. Southampton's Luke Shaw and Atletico Madrid's Filipe Luis remain targets. United were rebuffed in enquiries for both last month although talks will be resumed in the summer. Monaco also have an interest in Filipe. He has been out with an adductor rupture but is expected to return for the Madrid derby on March 2. Manchester City will offload Javi Garcia in the summer as they look to recruit a new defensive midfielder. The Premier League title contenders have agreed a deal for 20-year-old Argentine Bruno Zuculini from Racing Club but also want a player with more experience. Garcia has failed to establish himself at Eastlands and his departure was discussed as part of negotiations over the proposed deal for Porto's Fernando and Eliaquim Mangala last month. Fernando has since agreed a new contract at Porto but is one of City's options as they re-evaluate players for that position with Blaise Matuidi of Paris St Germain and Southampton's Victor Wanyama among the names being studied. What's going on? Javi Garcia's future is under threat at Manchester City . Next in: City are close to sealing a deal for Porto midfielder Fernando . On the radar: Victor Wanyama (left) and Blaise Matuidi are being monitored by Manchester City . Garcia, 27, joined City in 2012 from Benfica for £15.8m and scored on his debut against Stoke but he has struggled to progress since alongside more illustrious performers. Napoli wanted to take him on loan last month and may come back into the market depending on City's asking price with Garcia still having three years left on contract. Porto midfielder Fernando's agent, Antonio Araujo, told Portuguese radio yesterday that his client will move to the Premier League. Although City are considered favourites for his signature, Everton and Liverpool have shown an interest in the 26-year-old, with Everton having gone to the lengths of securing a work permit for him ahead of a failed bid last summer. Manchester United were also offered Fernando but had reservations about his level. France international Matuidi had agreed a new contract in principle with PSG but is understood to be holding off signing it as City and Arsenal  show interest. Wanyama was considered by City last year while at Celtic and his statistics make good reading at Southampton this season. They have conceded only 11 goals while he has been on the pitch and, since his return from injury, they have kept two clean sheets. Zuculini, meanwhile, will join City in the summer after confirmation from Racing Club president Victor Blanco. Talking to Argentine newspaper El Dia, Blanco said: 'We wanted to keep the side and reinforce it, but we have several highly coveted gems from the outside, such as Luciano Vietto, Rodrigo De Paul and Bruno Zuculini - who has already signed an agreement to leave in June to join Manchester City.' Chelsea have agreed a £3million deal with Hajduk Split for midfield prospect Mario Pasalic. MailOnline revealed talks were ongoing at the end of last month and the 19-year-old Croatia U19 international has confirmed he is moving in the summer. Pasalic made the announcement at Hajduk Split's 103-year anniversary celebrations saying: 'The Hajduk jersey is sacred and I will miss it in the summer when I go to Chelsea.' Chelsea will give a trial to 14-year-old Swedish prospect Almin Masic later this month. Masic from Orebro SK is a quick, wide midfielder with an eye for goal who impressed Chelsea scouts during a tournament at his hometown club last summer. He has been invited to train for a week with Chelsea's U15 side from February 24. Masic said: 'It feels great and I'm looking forward to going there and training. It will be a good experience.' Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa is Jose Mourinho's No 1 striker target for the summer. Chelsea will look at various ways to bring in the 25-year-old who has scored 24 goals in 26 games this season. Atletico would want the £32million buy-out clause figure as they need to bring in as much cash as possible to appease fans in any such sale. Eye catching: Diego Costa has emerged as one of the most fearsome strikers . Atletico may ask for Fernando Torres while Demba Ba could also be offered in negotiations. Chelsea have considered Edinson Cavani but Manchester United are favourites at this stage for his signature so long as they improve their form and finish the season with a flourish. On the move? Papiss Cisse . Papiss Cisse is a target for affluent clubs in China as they scour Europe for big name strikers ahead of their transfer window closing on February 28. Alan Pardew can ill afford to lose another player given their current results but Cisse has struggled to rediscover his old form. China though has proved an unhappy hunting ground for the likes of Nicolas Anelka and Didier Drogba, the likelihood is Cisse and Newcastle will wait until the summer. Reports in France say Newcastle received £20m for Yohan Cabaye but are due another £3.23m in bonuses over the next 18 months for the 28 year old central midfielder. Spartak Moscow and Dinamo Kiev are showing interest in signing Jermaine Pennant over the next few weeks. The former Arsenal and Liverpool winger is a free agent after his contract ended with Stoke City in January. The much-travelled 31-year-old made 11 appearances for Stoke this season and scored the winner in the Premier League game at West Ham in August. Tottenham are in discussions over a deal for Nigerian teenager Musa Yahaya. The midfielder has been linked with Manchester City recently but is due in London on Saturday to undergo medical test at Spurs Lodge and formalise a move to Tottenham. Yahaya, likened to Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta, was part of Nigeria's U17 World Cup winning team. The 16-year-old will be accompanied by his father, one of his agents Mohammed Babawo and Auwal Yusuf who is part of the Mutunchy Academy. Barcelona may retain an interest in Chelsea's David Luiz but Pep Guardiola remains keen on the Brazilian and will have the greater financial muscle at his disposal. Bayern have received a cash injection of £90million after selling off an 8.33 percent stake in their stock company which will allow them to pay off their stadium debts. Insurance company Allianz, which already holds naming rights to the team’s stadium, now shares a 25 per cent stake in the Bayern Munich Aktiengesellschaft (AG) along with other Bavaria-based brands Adidas and Audi. Munich-bound? David Luiz is a target for all-conquering Bayern . The remaining 75 per cent belongs to the club and its members. None of the £90m will go into the day-to-day business but does allow other monies to be focused on a burgeoning player budget. On Wednesday, the German sports weekly Sport Bild published a list of the Bayern payroll, claiming France international Franck Ribery and Germany star Mario Goetze are the top earners at the club, with an annual salary of £9.8m. Philipp Lahm and Bastian Schweinsteiger are reported to be on £8.2m, while Toni Kroos, who has yet to renew his contract having failed to agree terms with the club, currently only earns £3.7m. Leed will rival Sheffield Wednesday for the loan signing of Connor Wickham. The England U21 international was recalled by Gus Poyet in the last week of January from a spell at Hillsborough where he had enjoyed a productive spell with eight goals in 11 games including one in the 6-0 thrashing of Leeds. Brian McDermott has also considered Matty Fryatt at Hull City as he looks to kick-on on the playing front while talks continue over a proposed takeover. Coveted Hamburg defender Jonathan Tah asked not to be considered for last weekend's clash with Hertha Berlin. MailOnline reported the 17-year-old centre-back is caught in a contract dispute with his father, agent and Hamburg and Manchester United, City and Arsenal are showing interest. HSV sporting director Oliver Kreuzer said: 'Jonathan is not terribly difficult, but he did not play. It was simply because the boy has endured an awful lot during the week.'","Inter Milan watched Evra in the Arsenal v United clash .

"By . Neil Ashton . The Premier League’s top clubs claim they are clean after Barcelona were banned from two transfer windows for breaching rules relating to signing Under 18 players. Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal insist they all acted within FIFA guidelines over the transfer of young players into English football. Barcelona have been stopped from signing players in the next two transfer windows for breaching Article 19 of the FIFA statutes. FIFA raided Barcelona’s La Masia academy over the signings of Dutch-Nigerian Under 14 Bobby Adekanye; three Korean Under 15s (Lee Seung Woo, Paik Seung-Ho and Jang Gyeolhee), France Under 16 Theo Chendri, and Cameroon Under 14 Patrice Sousia.

FIFA’s . statement relating to Barcelona’s conduct said: ‘The disciplinary . committee emphasised the protection of minors in the context of . international transfers is an important social and legal issue that . concerns all stakeholders in football. ‘The . committee highlighted that while international transfers might, in . specific cases, be favourable to a young player’s sporting career, they . are very likely to be contrary to the best interests of the player as a . minor.

Problem: Valdes suffered a serious knee injury last week and is due to leave the club in the summer . Deep pockets: Barca have made at least one big-money buy in recent summers, including Fabregas in 2011 . The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the Real Federacion Espanola de Futbol (RFEF) and Spanish club FC Barcelona for breaches relating to the international transfer and registration of players under the age of 18. The sanctions follow investigations initially conducted by FIFA Transfer Matching System GmbH (FIFA TMS) over the course of last year and subsequently by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee as part of disciplinary proceedings. The RFEF and FC Barcelona were found to have violated several provisions concerning the international transfer and first registration of non-Spanish minors with the club, as well as other relevant regulations with regard to the registration and participation of certain players in national competitions. The investigations concerned several minor players who were registered and participated in competitions with the club over various periods between 2009 and 2013. Currently, the main provision relating to the protection of minors in the context of international transfers is art. 19 of the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (the 'Regulations'). According to art. 19, international transfers of players are only permitted if the player is over the age of 18. However, the same article stipulates that international transfers of minor players are permitted under three limited circumstances, and such exceptions may only be granted after evaluation by the sub-committee of the Players’ Status Committee. In this respect, the Disciplinary Committee emphasised that the protection of minors in the context of international transfers is an important social and legal issue that concerns all stakeholders in football. Above all, the committee highlighted that while international transfers might, in specific cases, be favourable to a young player’s sporting career, they are very likely to be contrary to the best interests of the player as a minor. On the basis of this analysis, the committee concluded that 'the interest in protecting the appropriate and healthy development of a minor as a whole must prevail over purely sporting interests.' The Disciplinary Committee underlined that FIFA takes the protection of minors in football very seriously. The protection of minors is one of the key principles included in the agreement concluded between FIFA, UEFA and the European Commission in 2001. The Disciplinary Committee acknowledged that young football players are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse in a foreign country without the proper controls. This particular fact makes the protection of minors in football by the sport’s governing bodies, especially by FIFA, even more important. With regard to the case in question, FC Barcelona has been found to be in breach of art. 19 of the Regulations in the case of ten minor players and to have committed several other concurrent infringements in the context of other players, including under Annexe 2 of the Regulations. The Disciplinary Committee regarded the infringements as serious and decided to sanction the club with a transfer ban at both national and international level for two complete and consecutive transfer periods, together with a fine of CHF 450,000. Additionally, the club was granted a period of 90 days in which to regularise the situation of all minor players concerned. With regard to the RFEF, the Disciplinary Committee determined that the association had also violated art. 19 of the Regulations and other provisions in the context of the transfer and first registration of certain minor players. In this respect, the RFEF was sanctioned with a fine of CHF 500,000 and granted a period of one year in which to regularise their regulatory framework and existing system concerning the international transfer of minors in football. In addition, the RFEF and the club were issued with a reprimand in accordance with art. 14 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code. The web-based Transfer Matching System (TMS) became mandatory for all international transfers of professional male players within the scope of eleven-a-side football in October 2010. As early as 2009, the use of TMS was obligatory in all applications for a first registration of a minor or an international transfer involving a minor in accordance with art. 19 of the Regulations. FIFA TMS, founded as a FIFA subsidiary in 2007, established a compliance programme in 2010 to ensure that all international transfers of professional football players are conducted through TMS in accordance with the Regulations, and to control the integrity of club and association behaviour and data in TMS. Cases involving violations of the Regulations, in particular Annexes 2 and 3, are identified and investigated and, where applicable, are then forwarded to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee for evaluation and decision. FIFA TMS monitors transfer activity using internally-developed market intelligence, external sources and information received from the FIFA Players’ Status & Governance and Disciplinary & Governance departments.","Barcelona's plans are thrown into chaos by transfer ban imposed by FIFA .

"By . Ray Massey . Motorists are to benefit from a £200 million fund to end the curse of potholes which has worsened in the wake of the severe winter’s torrential rain and floods. Councils will be able to apply for cash to fund road repairs and fill in the holes. But while motoring groups and councils welcomed the extra cash, they said it wouldn’t go far enough and was itself likely to disappear just as quickly down a hole. Motorists are set to benefit from a £200million fund announced by the Chancellor George Osborne in yesterday's budget. The money has been set aside to fix potholes that have resulted from the torrential rain and heavy floods this winter . But the RAC said the announcement does not go far enough. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC foundation, said the drip, drip funding does not address the £10billion road maintenance backlog that councils themselves have identified . Chancellor George Osborne told . Parliament that the flooding had persuaded him to make an additional . £140million to repair and maintain damaged flood defences. But . he stressed: ‘Our roads too have taken a battering.’ He singled out the . MP for Northampton North who ad been ‘a persistent campaigner for . resources to repair the pot-holes in his constituency and across the . country.’ And he added:’His persistence has paid off and I’m making £200 million available which local authorities can bid for.’ Mr Osborne also announced a guarantee of up to £270 million to support the raising of debt finance for the Mersey Gateway Bridge. The Government is offering to extend the feasibility study on possible improvements to the A1 north of Newcastle upon Tyne into Scotland, if funding is matched by the Scottish Government. The Welsh Government can use existing powers to begin investing in improvements to the M4. And UK Government is also financially supporting the Greater Cambridge enterprise partnership’s transport plans in a deal worth up to £500million over 15 to 20 years. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation said: ‘A succession of bad weather, including the recent floods, has wrought havoc on our roads and any money to fill the potholes is welcome. But he added: 'The drip, drip of funding does not address the £10billion road maintenance backlog that councils themselves have identified. ‘It is also disappointing that this money has to be bid for. This creates a bureaucratic burden and means not all councils and drivers will see the benefits.’ Tony Ball, vice chairman of the Local Government Association’s economy and transport board, said: ‘We are pleased that the Government has responded to our calls for extra funding to tackle potholes.’ But he added; ‘This announcement does not go anywhere near far enough. 'We urge the Government to provide a full and comprehensive package, including the resurfacing of roads, rather than funding in dribs and drabs.’ Mr Ball said: ‘We are facing a 42per cent increase in traffic on local roads by 2040 and there is a £10.5billion backlog of road repairs. The situation is getting worse every year because of a £500 million shortfall.’ There was relief that the planned 3p per litre September fuel duty rise was frozen and will not take place. But the Chancellor resisted calls to actually cut duty. The AA said the freeze on duty, for a fourth year, was ‘very welcome relief for UK drivers’. But AA president Edmund King said: ‘The freeze still leaves the squeeze on families and businesses that rely on four wheels to function and prosper. A move to freeze the planned 3p rise in fuel duty was welcomed by the AA . ‘Now that we know, from official figures, that inflation-hit earnings are effectively at 2002 levels and car use is struggling to revive, perhaps a short-term cut in fuel duty would have got the UK properly mobile again.’ RAC director Professor Glaister said: ‘The good news is that fuel duty has now been frozen since March 2011. 'The bad news is that the UK’s 37 million drivers still pay the highest proportion of petrol and diesel tax in Europe. 'Yet the stubbornly high pump prices mean transport costs remain a real concern for the record 18 million people who rely on a car to get to work.’","Chancellor George Osborne announced £140million for flood defences .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . In a drive to find homes for pets in its care, the RSPCA has launched a campaign pairing its animals up with some unlikely companions - characters from the television series Game of Thrones. Officials at the animal charity have taken shots of some of their lonely pets who they say are doppelgangers for stars of the hit television show and not just when it comes to their looks. They say a whole host of homeless pets, including dogs, horses and even pigs look like and are similar in nature to Game of Thrones characters. Three-year-old Barry, a green-eyed bull mastiff has been paired with character The Hound played by Rory McCann . 12-year-old Sheba the cat, found herself matched with the 'Mother of Dragons' ,actress Emilia Clarke, thanks to her beautiful blonde locks . Three-year-old Barry, a bull mastiff, is one of the animal look-a-likes, who has been paired with character Sandor Clegane, also known as The Hound, played by Rory McCann. The Hound is also a bodyguard for King Robert in the series and is known for his brutal, but also compassionate character. Similarly 12-year-old Sheba the cat, found herself matched with Daenerys Targaryen, known as the 'Mother of Dragons' played by Emilia Clarke - thanks to her beautiful blonde locks. Two-year-old cocker spaniel Buster was paired with character Jon Snow because of his personality. Buster is described as 'dogged' and  'loyal' and has 'puppy-dog eyes to die for'. Jon Snow is played by actor Kit Harington and known for his fighting skills and moral character. Two-year-old cocker spaniel Buster was paired with character Jon Snow as 'he is dogged, loyal and has puppy-dog eyes to die for . One-year-old spaniel Coco found herself coupled with ladylike Sansa as a result of her personality - 'happy, lively and has a love of company' One-year-old spaniel Coco found herself coupled with ladylike Sansa Stark as a result of her personality - 'happy, lively and has a love of company'. Milo, the two-year-old pig, is said to be the twin of King Robert, as the pair are 'sociable, outgoing and can have voracious appetites'. A spokesman for the RSPCA said it is hoped the latest campaign will see many of their pets rehomed. The spokesman said: 'They may not have . much in common on paper but the characters of the hit TV show Game of . Thrones have some unlikely animal doppelgangers. 'Like . the diverse cast of GOT, the RSPCA wants to showcase its wide variety . of animals up for rehoming - from dogs and cats to pigs and horses.

Beatrix, the cat who is homeless at 16, has been paired with Game of Thrones character Joffrey - but carers insist they are not alike in nature . The latest figures released by the charity show it takes an average of 42 days for a dog to find a new home, higher than ever before. Clipper the horse, one of the latest to find themselves homeless, as a result of the floods, was paired up with Khal Drogo who leads a nomadic life as a powerful Horse-Lord. Beatrix, 16, found herself unfortunately paired with teenage Joffrey, the current ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, known by many as a 'vicious idiot'. Carers were quick to add that the cat did not share Joffrey's unfortunate personality and was merely a sweet-natured look-a-like. The much anticipated fourth season of HBO's Game of Thrones launches on Sunday in the U.S. and hits UK screens the following day.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Alexandra Klausner . and Sophie Jane Evans . Philip Seymour Hoffman's $10,000-a-month Manhattan apartment was littered with empty bags of a deadly type of heroin, it has been claimed. Investigators found 49 bags - branded 'Ace of Spades' and 'Ace of Hearts' - inside the fourth-floor apartment, according to officials. They usually contain a lethal mixture of heroin laced with fentanyl - an opiate used to soothe the pain of cancer patients. Philip Seymour Hoffman was discovered dead from a drug overdose that may have been caused by a lethal heroin fentanyl mix responsible for overdoses around the United Sates . The unusual brand names are among hundreds of stamps used by drug distribution crews to mark products, according to CNN. However, they haven't been seen in New York since 2008. The heroin - variously labelled as 'Bud . ice', 'Income tax' and 'Theraflu' - has been linked to more than 100 . deaths from coast to coast. The hardest hit states in . the epidemic are Maryland, with more than three dozen deaths since . September, and Pennsylvania, with almost two dozen this month alone, . according to reports. And a further 22 people died of . heroin-fentanyl overdoses in Rhode Island during the first two weeks of . this year, officials told the Providence Journal. Deadly: Investigators found 49 empty bags stamped with 'Ace of Spades' and 'Ace of Hearts' inside the actor's Manhattan apartment, according to officials. They usually contain a lethal mix of heroin and fentanyl - also known as 'Bud Ice' (above) Risk: The lethal concoction - also referred to as 'Theraflu' - has been linked to more than 100 deaths in the US . Yesterday, Fox reported that police were 'looking at if (Hoffman) had the bad batch going around.' Hoffman, 46, who won the Academy Award . for best actor for the 2005 film, Capote, was found dead in his . apartment on Sunday morning following an apparent drug overdose. Officials said the American actor and father of three was found on . the bathroom floor of the $11,000 a month West Village . apartment. He was wearing only shorts and a t-shirt - and had a hypodermic needle sticking out of his left arm, according to officials. A neighbor who saw the actor on Saturday told Fox that he looked, 'Gray, not good.' Heroin . overdose deaths across the country are spiking as the deadly new variant . of the drug mixed with fenatanyl is spreading from New . Hampshire to Washington State. Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane is so concerned about the deaths she announced a task force comprised of state, county and local police departments dedicated solely to eradicating it from Western Pennsylvania. Though Pennsylvania’s cases have so far . been the highest profile, Maryland’s medical examiner says 37 people in . the state have died in the last five months from injecting the poisonous . potion, CBS DC reported. The deaths were spread throughout the whole state, with 10 occurring in drug-ravaged Baltimore. 'People believe that they’re shooting heroin but the substance does not look like heroin and they’re shooting it and they’re dying,' a rehabilitation expert told the Providence Journal. Deadly: Fentanyl is up to 100 times more potent than morphine, and is being blamed for the rash of recent deaths . Police in Portsmouth, NH, responded . to three overdoses in a single 24-hour period one day last week alone, . one of those people died, an official told Portsmouth Patch. Meanwhile, authorities in Nassau County, a Long Island suburb of New York, say the deadly dope has recently killed at least five people, Newsday reported. Other deaths linked to fentanyl-laced heroin have also been reported in Louisiana and Washington State. People . are overdosing because the combination of fentanyl and heroin is recent . trend, and results in a much more powerful high than users have seen . before. Fentanyl is an . opiate up to 100 times more powerful than morphine, Dr Karl Williams, . the Allegheny County (PA) Medical Examiner told CBS News. The people who died from overdose were all discovered to have taken the lethal combination. Not like normal heroin: The killer heroin has a white color (pictured), far from the yellow tinted heroin most often found on the street . ‘They . found almost exactly the same substance in those stamped bags, a fifty – . fifty mixture of heroin with Fentanyl,’ he said, adding the opiate . provides a higher high than heroin by itself. A Pittsburgh addict who declined to be identified told CBS News of his close brush with death after taking ‘bud ice.’ His dealer told him to ‘be careful,’ which he said is the first time he’d ever been warned. ‘I . go home, lock myself in my bathroom and I do [the drugs], and within 20 . seconds I was out,’ he recalled, saying his mother broke down the door . to revive him. Maryland’s chief medical examiner told CBS Baltimore the heroin variant kills people by shutting down their respiratory system. ‘Both substances slow down your breathing and can eventually slow it down to the point of death.'Officials . in Louisiana, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Washington State have . also blamed the drug for overdoses in their regions, according to CBS. First major bust: Tywon Newby is the first suspected dealer arrested for slinging the tainted dope . Fentanyl-heroin . combinations have reared their ugly heads in the past, most notably . during the spring of 2006 in Chicago and Detroit – almost 300 people . died from February to June while using the drug between the two cities, . according to the Washington Post. Authorities say that the easiest way to spot the more lethal heroin cocktail is because it is white. Heroin usually has a yellow tint to it. Even more scary, one expert told CBS News, is that dope slingers appear willing to let the drug kill some addicts because it will attract more business from junkies chasing a more potent high. ‘They're willing to lose four or five people to a drug overdose death to maybe attract 30 or 40 new customers and that's just the cost of doing business,’ said Dr. Neil Capretto of Gateway Rehab. Sobering reality: The arrest of Tywon Newby (left) took a significant amount of the tainted dope of the streets, but also showed investigators dealers may have already started re-branding it to evade targeted enforcement . Pennsylvania authorities may have finally started making progress in their fight against the deadly blend. A slate of arrests has been announced over the past 24 hours of people charged with distribution.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A New Hampshire man has lost his life savings on a carnival game, and he walked away with a massive stuffed banana with dreadlocks to show for it. Henry Gribbohm bet a total of $2,600 on the game, called Tubs of Fun, during a day out at the Manchester carnival on Saturday. The touring carnival is run by New Hampshire-based Fiesta Shows.

"By . Scarlett Russell . Three to five years into a marriage is the most common time for the man or woman to have an affair, a new survey has claimed. According to research by AshleyMadison.com, the most commonly-used extra-marital dating website in the world, the ‘seven-year itch’ is a thing of the past. Not only does infidelity start much sooner than this, the site also concluded that a couple’s first pregnancy is likely to prompt an affair. We won't tell: AshleyMadison.com is the biggest extra-marital dating website in the world, with over 25million users from 35 countries, including the U.S. Interestingly, the research showed that it is equally both men and women who are likely to cheat at this time. AshleyMadison has 25 million members in 35 countries around the world. Expert quote: Noel Biderman, founder and CEO of extra-marital dating website AshleyMadison, pictured here, says the most common time for the site's members to cheat is after three to five years of marriage . It's founder, Noel Biderman, says the . time when a couple first have a child is so difficult, it can prompt one . of the spouses to cheat. ‘Sexual desires and attractiveness may decrease during and after the birth of a first child and trigger affairs,’ he says. ‘Often women no longer feel attractive, or are physically impaired by their pregnancy, whilst men can find sex in close proximity to their child problematic. ‘Therefore people find themselves searching for someone outside the marriage to help them meet needs that aren’t being met at home.' The average age of AshleyMadison members is 30-40, with an equal amount of men and women seeking affairs. AshleyMadison also recently surveyed 74, 6000 of its members from 26 countries - 33,500 from the U.S. - asking about how often they have sex with their spouses.

And Caine is grateful to his Indian-born wife of 40 years Shakira for introducing him to its health benefits. Speaking to Hollywood chat show host  Larry King backstage after a fundraising event for Alzheimer’s research, Caine said: ‘I am married to an Indian lady and have learned about Indian culture. ‘I looked into what they got and didn’t get.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A staggering 800 police officers across England and Wales are currently off sick with stress-related illnesses, it was reported today. A survey of the 43 police forces found that smaller, largely rural forces have some of the highest proportions of officers off work with stress. In total 787 officers were listed as currently signed off for stress, but as only 35 forces responded to the Freedom of Information request the real figure could be much higher. The latest allegations about the finances of the Federation - described by one source as just the tip of the iceberg (stock picture) It means the taxpayer is footing the bill which is estimated to be just under £29 million a year. However, it is not known how long each officer has been signed off. Experienced police constables earn . £36,500 a year while senior officers earn much more, The Sunday Telegraph reported. The pay scale for a superintendent rises to £72,585 a year. The highest sick rate was in Derbyshire Constabulary, which reported 30 officers were signed off with stress, amounting to 1.64 per cent of their total number. In comparison, the Metropolitan Police - . by far the biggest force in England and Wales - reported 101 officers . were off with stress, amounting to just 0.33 per cent of their total . numbers. The second highest proportion of officers off sick was West Midlands, with 1.58 per cent. The Metropolitan Police - by far the biggest force in England and Wales - reported 101 officers were off with stress, amounting to just 0.33 per cent of their total numbers . And the third was in Bedfordshire - the fourth smallest force in the country - which reported 1.56 per cent, or 17 of its 1,092 officers. Greater Manchester Police, the second largest force in England and Wales, had 71 officers off with stress, or 0.99 per cent of their 7,200 total. Workers will be referred for health assessments if they are sick for more than four weeks under a new scheme to be launched by the Department for Work and Pensions. Under the Health and Work Service scheme, assessments will carried out by occupational specialists to draw up a plan and timetable to get the patient back to work quickly. Employees will be referred by a GP or their employer but the assessments are not compulsory. Up to 960,000 workers in Britain were on sick leave for more than a month each year between October 2010 and September 2013, according to new figures released by the DWP. Employers face a yearly bill of around £9 billion for sick pay and associated costs, with individuals missing out on £4 billion a year in lost earnings. The DWP believes the scheme, to be launched in England, Scotland and Wales, will save employers £70 million a year and cut the time people spend off work by 20 per cent to 40 per cent. Across England and Wales there were 128,350 officers at the end of September 2013, a drop of nearly 3,500 in 12 months and the lowest number since September 2002. The figures come on the back of savage budget cuts being enforced. When the Coalition came to power it said it would reduce government police grants by 20 per cent over the four years to 2015. As a result the number of officers in England and Wales will fall by 16,000 from 140,000 and pay and pensions are being shaken up. A spokesman for the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'Our members are being asked to do more and more with fewer resources and while they have risen admirably to the challenge it is inevitable that the increased pressures they’re facing will have an impact on their health and wellbeing.' Phil Mason, Derbyshire's head of human resources, said: 'We are surprised that our stress-related absences are higher than other police forces as we do benchmark overall absence with other forces and there has been no indication that our absence levels are significantly higher.' 'Derbyshire Constabulary offers all staff a full confidential care employee assistance programme which includes counselling and emotional support. We offer referrals to our Occupational Support Unit to assist officers with stress-related conditions, recovery and a return to work plan.'","Taxpayer foots the bill estimated to be just under £29 million a year .

"By . James Rush . Angry Michael Schumacher fans have criticised a German magazine after they published a picture of the star smiling together with his wife Corinna above the headline 'awake'. Fans who bought the women's magazine Die Aktuelle discovered it was simply full of stories about people who had awoken after a coma. German news portal News.de said they had asked the publisher if it had been a deliberate attempt to trick people into buying the publication, or simply careless subbing. But the German publisher of the magazine, the Gong-Verlag, has so far declined to comment on the outrage over the allegations it was simply trying to cash in on the tragedy. Michael Schumacher fans have complained after a German magazine published a picture of the star smiling together with his wife Corinna above the headline 'awake' (left). Mrs Schumacher is pictured (right) arriving at the hospital where her husband is being cared for in January . Schumacher's family have been told by doctors the F1 racing star is unlikely to wake up from his medically induced coma, which he was put in three months ago to reduce brain swelling following a skiing accident in the Alps where he hit his head on a boulder (file picture taken in 2000) Reader Dr Gerd Hartmann wrote in the . comments section of News.de: 'Such magazines are simply terrible, especially given that the . chances of survival with this type of therapy are abysmal. Out of 10 . patients 5 would never recover, 3 will be severely disabled and only 2 . might recover.' Another . user posting as SchumiFan posted: 'I can't believe they are cashing in . on this tragedy, there should be a law against this type of shoddy, . sensationalist and downright insulting journalism.' On Twitter, one Schumacher fan said: 'The magazine should be sued. It is just terrible. Tasteless.' Another wrote: 'It was just a blatant attempt to sell more copies of their mag through sensational stories.' German . media ethics expert Christian Schicha said: 'This is a clear attempt to . deceive the readers. It is an obvious attempt to make money out of a . sick man. It is completely tasteless. It is ethically completely out of . the question. 'Die . Aktuelle blatantly makes the impression through the headline that they . know something new about the case. It is completely irresponsible. Schumacher’s family have suffered enough without this kind of story circulating.' The family currently make a 150-mile round trip from their Swiss home every day to visit 45-year-old Schumacher in the Grenoble University Hospital in France where he is receiving treatment . The anger at the magazine's front page follows reports that wife Corinna, 45, is installing a £10m medical suite in their family home near Lake Geneva in Switzerland, so her husband can be cared for at home instead of the hospital. They spend up to ten hours by his bedside, offering up prayers for his recovery, before returning home in the evening.

They have been told by doctors that the F1 racing star is unlikely to wake up from his medically induced coma, which he was put in three months ago to reduce brain swelling following a skiing accident in the Alps where he hit his head on a boulder. Since then, there have been few encouraging signs of recovery and the racing ace has been wasting away in his hospital bed, losing 25 per cent of his body mass to now only weigh 8st 7lbs. Last month it was reported Schumacher was airlifted to the 'wrong' hospital after his ski crash, losing vital hours to save him. The outrage at the magazine's front page follows reports that wife Corinna, 45, is installing a £10m medical suite in their family home near Lake Geneva in Switzerland . It was claimed he was rushed to a local clinic instead of being taken to brain specialists. Gary Hartstein, the former chief doctor of Formula One say he believes this decision could have majorly affected his chances of recovery. He told The Sun: 'You do not take patients with a suspected head injury to hospitals that do not have neuro-surgical capability.' After being initially airlifted to Moutiers Schumacher was taken to Grenoble University Hospital, about 50 miles away where he has remained since.","Front page featured photo of Schumacher smiling with his wife Corinna .

"Judge said they saw elderly as 'easy meat' and left victims traumatised . By . Richard Spillett . This is the moment rogue traders ransacked a pensioner's roof before charging him ten times what they first quoted for damage following last year's winter storms. The 68-year-old was originally told he would have to pay £25 after a few tiles slipped off his roof in high winds in February 2013. But conmen John and Michael O'Brien, who were jailed this week for targeting the elderly in a series of building scams, later told him it would cost £248 after they removed even more of his roof. The gang took advantage of storm damage to get on to the man's roof, then demanded ten times the amount of money after removing more tiles themselves . Luckily, the quick-thinking pensioner took photographs of the men and alerted police to their activities. The shocking case was just one of a number of scams carried out by the pair, Cardiff Crown Court heard this week. The first victim targeted was a 70-year-old man living alone in Bridgend, south Wales, who was told a £410 garage door he had ordered was being delivered. Prosecutor Matthew Cobbe told the court: 'He hadn't ordered anything and told him to go away but his door was knocked for the next hour.' Cardiff's John O'Brien (left) was jailed for 38 months and Michael O'Brien (right) was given 30 months for the scams . One woman was left facing a huge repair bill after her entire ceiling was removed by the men . Despite the victim turning out his lights in the hope the men would leave, they eventually persuaded him to pay £446, the court heard. Mr Cobbe said: 'Over the next week there were repeated requests for money and several visits to his HSBC bank. 'Two men phoned him, keeping up the pressure. On Monday he withdrew £200 then £300 on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. 'By now he had handed over £1,550 but bank staff called police, concerned about the withdrawals and the male (Michael O'Brien) who was with the pensioner. 'The old door of his garage had been removed by the defendant, work an expert later valued at £50.' The victim was left angry, upset and embarrassed by what happened, the court heard. CCTV footage showed how the conmen even went to their victims' banks in a bid to get more money from them . In the following weeks, a 58-year-old woman was told she needed new uPVC on the front of her house, which could be done for £350. Despite telling John O'Brien she couldn't afford it, he began dismantling the exterior of her home, 'stripping it to the asbestos', the court heard. She was later convinced to hand over another £700 before she was told there was a problem in her loft which would cost £1,800. After she alerted her ex-husband to what was going on, the workmen disappeared, the court heard. The rogue traders left their victims' homes in disarray, but also left their fingerprints on a paint tin . Mr Cobbe said: 'They never came back but she had to . call in builders to put right the guttering and fascia. She was left . feeling so vulnerable that she took the overdose.' Days later, a 67-year-old who walks with a stick was followed to her Cardiff home by two men who offered to paint it for £40. She agreed, but was later asked for a further £1,200. Mr Cobbe told the judge: 'It is clear she did not know what she was paying for and having taken £1,200 from her, they then turned their attention to the house itself. 'She described John O'Brien as being determined to take down her kitchen ceiling, telling her she had a water leak, then saying there would be a lot of rubbish to take away and charging her another £2,400. 'When she said she didn't have it, on his suggestion she took out a loan from her bank but having then paid £3,600 he said he needed £3,000 more, which the bank refused to give her because her only income was a small pension.' The woman's home was left with no ceiling and debris all over her kitchen, the court heard. Michael O'Brien, 21, who had no previous convictions, admitted defrauding four victims and John O'Brien, 34, who had a list of 46 previous offences, accepted he had cheated three. John O'Brien, of Whitaker Road, Splott, Cardiff, was jailed for 38 months and Michael O'Brien, of Seagar Drive, Cardiff Bay, was given 30 months. Judge Philip Richards told them: 'In your language they were easy meat but serious psychological harm was done.' Peter Harding-Roberts, for father-of-four John O'Brien, said he disputed being part of a big organised gang but accepted he had taken up the offer to make some money. Mr Harding-Roberts told the court that O'Brien's guilty pleas showed he was remorseful. But the judge said: 'You would think that the first time he saw the distress on a victim's face, that would have produced remorse... but he just went on and on.'","Conmen told 68-year-old the work would cost £25 - before demanding £248 .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Thousands of people around the world armed themselves with fluffy pillows as they revisited a childhood tradition and battled it out for International Pillow Fight Day. For the sixth year in a row, Trafalgar Square was invaded for an hour this afternoon as Londoners let their inhibitions go and attacked strangers with gusto. Some people got so enthusiastic about the event that their pillows ripped and feathers flew into the air. Others opted to observe the action from the sidelines, instead choosing to capture the unique occasion on film. London was just one of more than 100 cities around the world to take part in the event - with similar sights spotted in Paris, New York, Zurich, Rome and Madrid. Participants . to the annual event, organised by Urban Playground Movement, were not . allowed to hit anyone with a camera, or anyone not armed with a pillow.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 7-year-old girl crowned Little Miss Hispanic Delaware in an August 31 pageant was stripped of her crown last week by pageant sponsors who said she wasn't Latina enough. Jakiyah McKoy took the top prize in the pageant also known as Miss Chiquita Delaware, stirring immediate outcries from some attendees because McKoy ‘was not the best representative of a Latin beauty.’ Why? Because her skin was of a darker color than the other contestants, though sponsor Nuestras Raíces Delaware claims it was the girl’s family’s inability to prove the requisite ’25 percent latina heritage’ that motivated them to strip her of the title. Scroll down for video... Unfair? Jakiyah's pretty face graced the cover of this Spanish language paper, but a couple of weeks after she was crowned, she was stripped of her title of Little Miss Hispanic Delaware . Decrowned: Jakiyah McKoy won the Little Miss Hispanic Delaware pageant August 31, but was stripped of her crown when her parents couldn't prove her '25 percent Latin heritage' as per contest rules . According to the McKoys, one of Jakiyah’s grandparents was a native of La Vega, Dominican Republic. El Tiempo Hispano reports that president of Nuestras Raíces Delaware Maria Parez claims the family just couldn’t prove it. ‘Her parents were asked to bring in documentation. Of all of the documentation brought in there was nothing that confirmed Dominican heritage,’ Perez said. A Change.org petition, which as of Thursday evening had just under 500 supporters, contends that it was the color of Jakiyah’s skin and not her lack of provable Latina heritage that lost her the crown. ‘Nuestras Raices Delaware has blocked her win after an outcry from people claiming that, because she is Black, she is ‘not the best representative of Latin beauty,’ writes Daniel José Older, who started the petition. ‘The title is now pending while the committee ‘investigates’ Jakiyah’s heritage. Meanwhile, none of the other competitors were subject to such an investigation.’ Consolation? Jakiyah became a mere runner-up once her crown was stripped, an consolation given to all the also-rans . Racism? The pageant sponsors say there was no documentation proving Jakiyah's grandmother was Dominican, as her family claimed. But the family and other supporters say she was treated unfairly for her black skin . Perez, meanwhile, claims the issue has arisen before. She told Latino Rebels that when questions arise over a contestant’s authentic Hispanic roots, her organization asks for proof. ‘We can’t have her be the queen if she doesn’t have the proper documentation,’ she said. ‘It’s not the first time that we’ve been confronted with the [burden of proof]. It’s happened in the past and they’ve brought in the proof and we were satisfied with it.’ Perez believes it was Jakiyah's family that started rumors that she was stripped of the title for being black and maintains her organization’s decision was not racially motivated. ‘Color has nothing to do with it,’ she told Latino Rebels. ‘We’re all Latinos. That’s why we’re so beautiful because we come in all different colors.’ Petition support Martina Ayala agreed, but wrote that she signed the petition because she sees hypocrisy in Jakiyah’s treatment. ‘If her ethnicity is being “investigated,” you need to do the same to all other contestants. Latinos come in all colors – we are “mestizos” and Jakiyah represents our African roots — she is a beautiful representative of “Nuestras Raices.” Nuestras Raices Delaware – stop the self-hate and educate yourselves on what it means to give honor to “Nuestras Raices.”’ In the end, it could boil down to a simple lack of documentation, and not a lack of Latina heritage, that has caused this controversy. Jakiyah’s Dominican grandmother is deceased. ‘Nothing came up,’ Perez explained. ‘There is no information on this deceased woman.'

"By . Snejana Farberov . Employees at a Georgia restaurant owned by celebrity chef Paula Deen's brother came to work this morning, only to discover that Uncle Bubba's Seafood & Oyster House has been abruptly - and permanently- shut down. The Savannah eatery, owned by Earl 'Bubba' Hiers Jr, announced its sudden closure on its website and Facebook page: 'Thank you for 10 great years. Uncle Bubba's is now closed.' The staff at Uncle Bubba's reportedly received no advance notice of the move and only learned of the closure this morning when they showed up to find the sign gone and kitchen equipment being carted away. Not in business: Uncle Bubba's Seafood & Oyster House in Savannah, Georgia, abruptly closed its doors today without giving their employees an advance notice . Fall from grace: Earl 'Bubba' Hiers Jr (left) and his sister the TV chef Paula Deen were unsuccessfully sued last year by Uncle Bubba's former general manager, who accused them of racial and sexual discrimination . Outraged people took to Facebook, riling against the management of the eatery for failing to come clean with the workers ahead of time that the establishment was going out of business. Jaime Linn Puckett wrote that her mother had spent the past eight years working at Bubba's, and no one bothered to give her a call. 'My fiance also worked there no one call him, in fact a UB manager called him LAST NIGHT to get his availability for next week!' she fumed. Puckett, who is six months pregnant, added that with her husband-to-be out of a job, she now has to work double shifts just to make ends meet. 'I hope Paula [Deen] enjoys that 75 million she just signed on while all employees of UB are left frantically searching for a job,' Miss Puckett wrote, referring to the former Food Network star's new multimillion-dollar restaurant that is expected to open in Tennessee. Jolted: Workers showed up at the restaurant this morning, only to discover the Uncle Bubba's sign gone . New venture: A PR firm representing Hiers stated . that he has decided to shutter his eatery to redevelop the waterfront . property on which the restaurant stands . Another commenter Jerry Calhoun piled on: 'It doesn't matter what may have happened, the fact that they had NO thought what so ever for the employees is absurd! They could have had called everyone in and announce, instead they post a sign. Cowards!' The move was so sudden that just two days earlier, Uncle Bubba's took to Twitter to promote their $16.99 crab special, and later inquired of their 2,400 followers which was their favorite stew. It has been reported that there was police presence outside Uncle Bubba’s Thursday morning, and that some cars were turned away from the restaurant parking lot. Savannah-Chatham Police Department spokesman Julian Miller clarified to MailOnline that the restaurant hired a single off-duty officer to provide security. The New York-based public relations firm the Key Group shed light on the hasty closure Thursday afternoon, saying in a statement to Savannah Morning News that Mr Hiers has decided to shutter his eatery ‘in order to explore development options for the waterfront property on which the restaurant is located.’ Exit strategy: The Savannah eatery announced the sudden closure on its website: 'Thank you for 10 great years. Uncle Bubba's is now closed' Just two days earlier, Uncle Bubba's took to Twitter to promote their $16.99 crab special (left), and later inquired of their 2,400 followers which was their favorite stew (right) According to the press release, employees will be provided with severance pay based on position and tenure, and efforts will be made to help find them comparable jobs. Earl ‘Bubbe’ Hiers found himself embroiled in a controversy last year over allegations of racism, which ultimately contributed to his sister's dismissal from the Food Network. Last year, Lisa Jackson, a former general manager at the restaurant, sued Hiers and Deen, accusing them of discrimination and sexual harassment. However, the suit was dismissed in August. The restaurant closure also comes less than two months after Uncle Bubba's was cited for significant health code violations, which earned it a ‘B‘ rating.","Uncle Bubba's Seafood & Oyster House in Savannah, Georgia, announced its closure effective April 3 on its website and Facebook page .

"By . Mark Prigg . A mobile phone charger that can be powered by either a cold beer or a hot coffee has been unveiled. The Epiphany One Puck, which doubles as a drinks coaster, connects to a phone with a USB cable. It has two sides, one red, one blue. Scroll down for video . The charger uses a Stirling engine to convert heat into energy, and it is hoped the gadget will go on sale next year for around £60 . Invented by Robert Stirling in 1816, the Stirling engine uses heat to produce energy. The engine is designed so that the working gas is compressed . in the colder portion of the engine and expanded in the hotter portion . to convert heat into energy. Owners use the red side as a drinks coaster to place a hot drink on it, and the blue side as  for a cooling drink such as a beer. It uses something called a Stirling engine to turn heat into energy.US company Epiphany Labs, based in New Castle, Pennsylvania, has built a working prototype and hopes to have it on the market early in 2014. The company is still vague on just how long it takes for the device to charge up a phone because there are a lot of variables at play, including how hot or cold the source is. Any source of heat that can fit on the Puck will work. It works best with something that's very warm like a steaming cup of tea or coffee or very cold like a well chilled beer or soft drink. Epiphany is aiming to raise £63,000 on fund raising website Kickstarter to turn the prototype into a gadget that can be mass-manufactured. By Feb 8, more than £25,000 (pounds) had been raised, and early birds can still get in for a £62  pledge price. The regular pledge for a Puck will be £73. Tim Joseph of Epiphany said: 'We called it Puck because of its shape. The blue side can be used as a coaster for a cooling drink such as a beer . 'We added ""onE"" Puck not only to imply that it is the one solution to this problem, but also to go with our ongoing theme that Epiphany has onE vision for onE world that we all share. 'The onE Puck is a neat gizmo for cell phone users, but the implications of this project are much farther reaching than just cell phones. 'Once we have this project off the ground, we'll get to work on larger scale versions of the onE Puck that will provide inexpensive power to households and villages using nothing but waste heat as the energy input. 'There's nothing new about the idea of using Stirling engines to do that, but no one has ever successfully brought them to market in an affordable package.' Any source of heat that can fit on the Puck will work, although the firm says it works best with something that's very warm like a steaming cup of tea or coffee . The gadget is simply flipped over to use the 'cold' side to create energy when needed .","Uses a Stirling engine to turn heat into energy .

"By . Meghan Keneally . The ex-wife of the Chobani yogurt founder has filed a lawsuit claiming that he paid 30,000 euros to a disgruntled former Fage employee so that he could have his competitor’s top secret recipe. Hamdi Ulukaya, the founder of the billion-dollar Chobani empire, is being sued by his ex-wife Ayse Giray because she claims he is trying to sell of parts of the company so that she loses her 53 per cent stake, even though her holdings are backed up by questionable proof to begin with. The latest court filing made numerous claims about how Ulukaya allegedly stole checks from his brother and threatened friends to help him first get the company off the ground, but one of the most explosive assertions is about his supposed deal to get Fage’s signature recipe. Man behind the brand: Hamdi Ulukaya (pictured in 2011) is fighting claims made by his ex wife, who says that he stole the recipe for his famed Chobani brand from his chief rival, Fage . On Friday, a New York court rejected . Ms Giray's claims and denied her a temporary restraining order to stop . her ex from pursuing any sale of the company. 'We’re . pleased with the Court’s decision to deny a temporary restraining order . and the plaintiff’s decision to withdraw the request for a preliminary . injunction as the allegations are completely baseless and without merit,' the company spokesman told MailOnline. Giray claimed  that her ex told her on numerous occasions about how he ‘boasted’ about flying to Europe to meet a former Fage employee and exchange the secret recipe and cooking process for 30,000 euros. The identity of the supposed corporate traitor has not been revealed, nor has any further information about the covert meeting. Mr Ulukaya has not publicly commented on the claims but a Chobani spokesman told The New York Post that they were ‘baseless and without merits’. Classic Greek yogurt has very simple ingredients, but there is a distinctive taste that differentiates the two brands. On its website, Fage boasts of how their product is ‘made with a family recipe that dates back to 1926, it contains no added sweeteners, thickeners, preservatives, powdered milk, powdered cream or powdered protein. Just milk, cream and live active cultures to create all natural FAGE yogurt.’ By comparison, Chobani’s website . explains how they worked for two years ‘discovering the perfect blend of . stevia, monk fruit and evaporated cane juice’. Fage uses cow’s milk and live yogurt cultures which are blended together and then strained. Chobani does the same procedure before adding fruit and sweeteners. ‘It's a thoughtful process that, unlike some of the other guys, ensures we never use preservatives,’ their website reads.

Chobani’s website explains how they worked for two years . ‘discovering the perfect blend of stevia, monk fruit and evaporated cane . juice’. They use . regional milk from cows near the company's Fulton County, New York . headquarters that is then turned into yogurt after a straining process . 'that's been around for generations'. 'This . special process makes our yogurt extra thick and gives it twice as much . protein than regular, unstrained yogurts,' their website states. They then add the combination of natural sweeteners and fruit, depending on the flavor. ‘It's a thoughtful process that, unlike some of the other guys, ensures we never use preservatives,’ the website reads. FAGE .

'Just milk, cream and live active cultures to create all natural . FAGE yogurt.’ Fage uses cow’s milk and live yogurt cultures which are blended together and then strained. 'Our . straining technique removes all of the watery whey from the pasteurized . cows’ milk, leaving you with only the thick, velvety texture of creamy . FAGE yogurt,' the website reads. The alleged instance of corporate thievery is not the only damning claim made by Giray in the filing, which was reported by The New York Post. She also alleged that her former husband was not against stealing from relatives and friends when he was first trying to get the company off the ground. He tried funding Euphrates, the original company that later evolved into what is now known as Chobani, by stealing checks from his brother’s account and forging his brother’s signature. The New York Post also reported that Ms Giray claimed that he stole and forged checks from his brother embezzled a check from his family and threatened that he wouldn’t return it unless he was given $750,000. Chobani has become a favorite among New York politicians because their headquarters is helping to bring jobs and boost the economy of the upstate farming communities. Senator Chuck Schumer blasted Russian officials from stopping American athletes from bringing the brand with them to Sochi during the Winter Games and Governor Andrew Cuomo has repeatedly used it as an example of ways that businesses can flourish in the state. Political issue: Chobani, which is valued at more than $1billion, has become a favorite success story of politicians including New York Lt Governor Bob Duffy (seen with Ulukaya in 2012) but the new court filing claims that Ulukaya paid a district attorney $1million to settle a case . One of Ms Giray's final claims may hurt that chummy relationship, however, as the lawsuit also alleged that her ex paid $1million to the Fulton County district attorney to settle a case about improper yogurt disposal. Ms Giray has listed off these claims as part of a court filing to try to get a judge to rule that Mr Ulukaya is not legally allowed to pursue any deals with private equity firm TPG, which Chobani is in talks with over a possible 15 per cent sale. This comes as the latest shot in an ongoing battle over Ms Giray’s claims to the majority ownership. She has a handwritten note written by Mr Ulukaya in 2003 that said that she was promised a 53 per cent stake in Eyphrates, the original company that came after she reportedly paid $500,000 as an initial investment in the company during their very early stages. Aside from the note, she has no other proof- such as stock certificates or legal deeds of ownership- to back up her case.","Founder Hamdi Ulukaya's ex wife tried to halt the sale of a portion of Chobani by trying to get a restraining order .

"By . Sara Malm . The Hong Kong billionaire playboy who offered nearly £40million to any man who could turn his homosexual daughter straight, has now doubled the 'dowry'. Cecil Chao raised the reward to HK$1billion (£80million) after thousands of eligible bachelors failed to convince his daughter Gigi to marry any of them.

Money talks: Cecil Chao has doubled the reward for any man who manages to convince his lesbian daughter Gigi to marry him, to HK$1billion (£80million), despite the fact that she already has a wife . Mr Chao told a Malaysian newspaper that despite offering HK$500million, approximately £40million, and 20,000 men registering their interest in taking up the quest, Gigi is still not in a straight marriage. He said that he did not want to interfere with his daughter’s private life, but that he wanted her to have 'a good marriage and children'. In response, Ms Chao said that although her wife had been left 'distraught' by her father's interview, she found it easier to ignore - even offering to comply with the terms, as long as the man in question donated a large part of the money to charity, and did not mind that she is already married. 'I don’t think my dad’s offering of any amount of money would be able to attract a man I would find attractive,' she told South China Morning Post.

Loving daughter: Ms Chao says she does not think her father is offering the bounty out of evil or spite, but rather that he does not understand that homosexuality cannot be changed as he is 'from another time' 'Alternatively, I would be happy to . befriend any man willing to donate huge amounts of money to my charity . Faith in Love, provided they don’t mind that I already have a wife. 'Third and lastly, thank you Daddy, I love you too.' ‘I'm not saying that she's not okay to be gay,’ Cecil Chao told ABC News 20/20 in October 2012. ‘I mean it's her own choice and her . own tendency, but she should make sure she knows what she wants.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Eating a Mediterranean diet is good for the mind, research has concluded. Scientists say people who eat large quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, fish and olive oil have a lower risk of age-related diseases such as dementia. The research, by the University of Exeter’s Medical School, is the first systematic review of previous studies into the diet’s benefits to the brain. Eat like the Greeks: Mediterranean food is both delicious and nutritious . It comes after research last month showed the same diet could help counteract a genetic risk of strokes. The team, supported by the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care in the South West Peninsula, analysed 12 eligible pieces of research, 11 observational studies and one randomised control trial. In nine of the 12 studies, a higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with better cognitive function, lower rates of cognitive decline and a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease. However, results for mild cognitive impairment - the stage before Alzheimer’s or dementia, when someone could be experiencing some cognitive difficulties - were inconsistent. Lead researcher Iliana Lourida said: 'Mediterranean food is both delicious and nutritious, and our systematic review shows it may help to protect the ageing brain by reducing the risk of dementia. 'While the link between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and dementia risk is not new, ours is the first study to systematically analyse all existing evidence.' People who eat large quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, fish and olive oil have a lower risk of age-related diseases such as dementia . She added: 'Our review also . highlights inconsistencies in the literature and the need for further . research.

"By . Becky Barrow . and Sarah Harris . Small firms were yesterday given a £2.5billion tax break on business rates in a desperate bid to stop empty shops blighting ailing High Streets. The Chancellor put the tax at the centre of his Autumn Statement as part of a six-pronged attempt to ease the financial burden on smaller enterprises. George Osborne said business rates ‘impose a heavy burden on businesses of all sizes’, but he was determined to fill the vacant shops. Small firms were yesterday given a £2.5billion tax break on business rates in a desperate bid to stop empty shops blighting ailing High Streets . More than 22,000 of the nation’s shops are lying empty, a wasteland equivalent to 23 city centres the size of Sheffield. Under the changes: . A discount of up to £1,000 a year for small retail businesses, such as pubs, cafes, restaurants, hairdressers, and charity shops, on their business rates bills. Not all shops will be eligible, with exclusions such as high-street betting shops and payday lenders. The discount will be available for the next two years. Firms will be allowed to spread their business rate payments over 12 months, rather than ten months, to spread the financial burden to help their cashflow. Simon Tivey, of Pricewaterhouse Coopers, said the Chancellor must beware that the changes do not just trigger ‘a merry-go-round of rate relief relocations’. A shop could, in theory, move from one empty premises to another to benefit from the discount. He also said it could lead to ‘a proliferation of charity shops’ because of the huge discounts of 80 per cent that they already get, with the prospect of a further £1,000 on top. More than 22,000 of the nation's shops are lying empty, a wasteland equivalent to 23 city centres the size of Sheffield . John Longworth, of the British Chambers of Commerce, said relentless increases in business rates have ‘sucked the life out of businesses in all parts of the UK.’ He said: ‘The Chancellor should have been bolder, freezing business rates entirely until this pernicious tax can be properly reformed.’ Liz Peace, of the British Property Federation, said: ‘The business rates regime remains one of the greatest barriers to investment in the built environment, and is fundamentally unfit for the 21st century.’ Funding will now come from the companies themselves, rather than from training providers. Steve Radley, director of policy at the EEF manufacturers’ organisation, said: 'Businesses have long been calling for a revolution in how apprenticeships are funded, and today their calls have been heard.’ Olivia Knight at her Business Premises in Brockley South East London - where she runs Patchwork Present . Business owner Olivia Knight could save hundreds of pounds a year in the long term when employers’ National Insurance contributions for workers under 21 are scrapped. She also believes new incentives for businesses to take over empty shops could help revitalise Britain’s ailing high streets. The 35-year-old has two full-time members of staff and is hoping to expand her present-buying company by taking on more. She will now seriously consider hiring younger workers to take advantage of the new incentive. Miss Knight’s company, Patchwork Present, is an online business with a shop in Brockley, South East London. If she takes on someone under 21 on a salary of £12,000, under the new rules she could save £500 a year in NI contributions. She said: ‘This could certainly help us in the future as we grow as I would certainly like to employ more young people. But she says she could only take them on if they have the right abilities. ‘If you’re a start-up company, our few workers need to have a range of skills and quite a lot of experience in order to cope with the stresses,’ she said. Patchwork Present was set up three months ago. It works by one person asking for a big present and friends and family donating small or large amounts of money to reach the total cost. Miss Knight also praised Mr Osborne’s plan to offer businesses who take over an empty shop a 50 per cent relief from business rates. She said: ‘I have just taken over an empty shop which was going to waste and the council said I wouldn’t have to pay any rates at all. The fact something like this is being introduced nationally is a great idea. Up and down the country, tragically, the High Street is changing and there are tons of empty shops where we live in South East London. ‘This is great for the community as if businesses can take over then the high streets can thrive.’ Expensive council houses will be sold off to pay for new, affordable homes. Local authorities will be urged to get rid of high-value, vacant properties. The proceeds will go to giving councils an extra £300million to borrow to build 10,000 new, affordable homes and regenerate rundown estates. Council tenants who want to move home so they can be closer to work will also get help. George Osborne said: ‘We want to regenerate some of our most rundown urban housing estates. Councils will sell off the most expensive social housing, so they can house many more families for the same money.’ He added: ‘We are going to give working people in social housing a priority right to move if they need to for a job.’ Local Government Association chairman Sir Merrick Cockell said councils had lobbied for the removal of the borrowing cap. ‘The easing of restrictions on housing investment does not go as far as we would like, but it does show that our call for more local flexibility to drive economic growth has been recognised.’ The Chancellor also announced £1billion worth of loans to developers ‘to unblock large housing developments on sites in Manchester and Leeds and across the country’. Universities in England will be allowed to recruit as many students as they want from 2015, the Chancellor announced yesterday. The Government is axing the limit on places, which means institutions will be able to expand without incurring fines. The overhaul will be funded through the sale of more student debt to private companies, amounting to £5.5billion over five years. This will fund students’ maintenance and tuition fee loans. George Osborne said the move was necessary as around 60,000 young people with the grades to study for a degree miss out on places every year due to an ‘arbitrary cap’. He added: ‘That makes no sense when we have a far lower proportion of people going to university than even the United States, let alone countries like South Korea.’ Universities Minister David Willetts said: ‘Removing the student numbers cap will free universities to recruit the students they want and give people far more choice over where to study.’ But Universities UK chief executive Nicola Dandridge said: ‘We will need to understand how this is sustainable in the long term, given that this policy is being funded in coming years by the asset sales.’ Professor Michael Gunn, chairman of the million+ think tank, said universities and students will want to know that the plans really do ‘add up’.","More than 22,000 of the nation’s shop units are lying empty .

Osborne 'business rates ""impose heavy burden on businesses of all sizes""’
A business which moves into the premises of an empty retail shop, which has been vacant for more than a year, will be eligible for a 50 per cent rates discount for 18 months. To get the discount, businesses have to move in between April 1, 2014, and March 31, 2016.
A discount of up to £1,000 a year for small retail businesses, such as pubs, cafes, restaurants, hairdressers, and charity shops, on their business rates bills. Not all shops will be eligible, with exclusions such as high-street betting shops and payday lenders. The discount will be available for the next two years.
Small business rates relief, which was .
due to end next spring, will be extended for a further 12 months until .
April 2015, benefiting 540,000 small firms. This allows small firms with .
a rateable value of up to £6,000 to pay no business rates, and cuts .
bills for larger firms with a rateable value of up to £12,000.
Beneficiaries of this relief will be able to keep it for one year, even .
if they expand into an additional property, which would have previously .
meant they lost the crucial relief.
Firms will be allowed to spread their business rate payments over 12 months, rather than ten months, to spread the financial burden to help their cashflow.
An extra 20,000 higher apprenticeships will be offered in England next year and the one after."
"By . Mark Duell . Charles Saatchi had the means to prevent his ex-wife Nigella Lawson entering the US, her friends suggested in extraordinary claims revealed today. The TV chef was stopped from boarding a flight at London Heathrow Airport on Sunday, apparently as a result of comments she made about taking drugs in evidence during an unrelated court case. But now, astonishingly, it has been alleged that Mr Saatchi could have had the connections to deny her entry to the US - even if he did not use them - thanks to his family links to the Obama campaign. Claim: Charles Saatchi (left) allegedly had the means to prevent ex-wife Nigella Lawson (right) entering the US . Mr Saatchi, 70, has a connection to Matthew Barzun, who was appointed US Ambassador in London by President Barack Obama last year, reported Emily Smith of the New York Post’s Page Six. Mr Barzun has been a Democratic party activist for many years - and the 43-year-old was an important fundraiser for the campaign to get Mr Obama elected in 2008, organising huge events. Also involved in the Obama campaign as a manager was 29-year-old Edward Saatchi - Mr Saatchi’s Oxford-educated nephew, who founded the private social network NationalField. A source told the New York Post: ‘We don’t know that Saatchi was behind this, but he certainly has the means and the contacts to do it. Links: Mr Saatchi reportedly has a connection to Matthew Barzun (pictured), 43, who was appointed US Ambassador in London by President Barack Obama last year . ‘Nigella’s friends cannot understand why she was specifically targeted, unless somebody, like her ex-husband, had tipped off the US authorities.’ 'We don’t know that Saatchi was behind this, but he certainly has the means and the contacts to do it' Source . At the trial of her and Mr Saatchi's personal assistants last year, the self-styled ‘domestic goddess’ admitted taking cocaine, and said her former husband was on a campaign to 'ruin me in any way'. There is no evidence that Mr Saatchi in fact used his contacts to prevent Miss Lawson’s entry to the US, or that any of the named contacts would have been willing to help him with this. The . US embassy in London said yesterday that following Miss Lawson being . prevented from flying to Los Angeles, she had now been invited to apply . for a visa and promised the matter could be ‘handled routinely and . expeditiously’. Relative: Edward Saatchi (pictured), 29, Mr Saatchi's Oxford-educated nephew, was involved in the 2008 Obama campaign as a manager and founded the private social network company NationalField . Admission: At the trial of Miss Lawson and Mr Saatchi's personal assistants Francesca Grillo (left) and Elisabetta Grillo (right) last year, the self-styled 'domestic goddess' admitted taking cocaine . During the . trial last December, the mother-of-two told jurors she took the class A . drug twice - once with her late husband John Diamond when he found out . he had terminal cancer and again in 2010 when she claimed she was being . ‘subjected to intimate terrorism’ by Mr Saatchi. BEFORE THE TRIAL . SAATCHI'I feel that I have clearly been a disappointment to Nigella during the last year or so' (2013) NIGELLA'I’ll go quiet when he explodes and then I am a nest of horrible festeringness' (2007) DURING THE TRIAL . SAATCHI . 'I was not gripping, strangling or throttling her. I was holding her head by the neck to make her focus, can we be clear?' ‘I adore Nigella now. I absolutely adore Nigella and I’m broken-hearted to have lost her’ NIGELLA'He said to me if I didn't go back and clear his name he would destroy me... I felt his way of getting things out was to use this case' 'It comes after a long summer of bullying and abuse and I find it another chapter in that' AFTER THE TRIAL . SAATCHI'The truth is that she was taking illegal drugs secretly throughout the last few years of our marriage, often with her own child when she was far too young to even smoke or drink' NIGELLA'To have not only your private life, but distortions of your private life, put on display is mortifying' 'There are people going through an awful lot worse and to dwell on any of it would be self-pity' But she told the court: ‘I have never been a drug addict. I've never been a habitual user.’ Miss . Lawson, 54, had also said during the trial that she had endured . bullying and abuse within her marriage, and believed Mr Saatchi was . using the case to air grievances. An eyewitness told the Mail . that Miss Lawson attempted to board a British Airways flight from London . on Sunday morning but was turned away. ‘She . didn't seem to say much but she did not look happy,’ the onlooker said. ‘She could not get on the flight so she had to turn around and leave.’ Legal experts said Miss Lawson . could have been unfortunate because her fame had drawn attention to what she said about drugs. However, Miss Lawson has visited America since the sensational court appearance. She appeared on US TV show Good Morning America to promote her show The Taste but also spoke at length about the trial of Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo. The Grillos had been accused of fraudulently using company credit cards, spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on designer goods for themselves while working as personal assistants to the celebrity couple. But the Italian sisters claimed every purchase had been approved by their then-bosses and they were found not guilty after jurors deliberated for nine hours. Miss Lawson told ABC's Good Morning America that having details of her acrimonious split from millionaire art dealer Mr Saatchi discussed in court under the glare of the world's media was ‘mortifying’. Comment requests were left today with Mr Saatchi’s spokesman and the US State Department. Passage blocked: Nigella Lawson could have been unlucky because her fame had drawn attention to the comments in court about drugs . Lawyer Susan McFadden, who specialises in US immigration law, said Nigella Lawson could have been unlucky because her fame had drawn attention to the comments in court about drugs. She explained: ‘In order to travel to the States without a visa on the visa waiver programme one has to obtain Esta (electronic system for travel authorisation) authorisation. ‘As part of that one has to answer questions about whether one has been arrested or convicted for an offence involving moral turpitude or in relation to a controlled substance. Someone in Ms Lawson's circumstances could tick no. ‘But the problem comes when one also has to answer a question as to whether you are a drug abuser or addict. The question of who is a drug user is a difficult one and is supposed to be directed by regulations set out by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ‘Typically any person who has used drugs within the last year can be considered a drug abuser or addict. It could be because she is unlucky enough to be famous and her admission of drug use made the newspapers. ‘It could be that someone said “hey, if she has used illegal drugs in the past year she could be classed as a drug abuser”.’ Ms McFadden explained that if this was the case, there were a series of steps which must be taken before Miss Lawson would be allowed back into the States. She would first be advised to visit a doctor who holds a contract with the US embassy in London who would carry out an assessment to see whether or not she could be classed under these terms. If the doctor says she should be free to travel she could obtain a visa in a number of weeks, Ms McFadden said. Police reviewed the allegations of drug use which emerged during the trial but Scotland Yard said no further action would be taken. So while Miss Lawson has not been convicted for any drug offence, it appears that US officials still decided to deny her entrance to the country. The US Department of Homeland Security told the Mail that foreigners who had admitted drug taking could be deemed ‘inadmissible’.","Nigella Lawson was stopped from boarding flight at Heathrow on Sunday .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A protection officer guarding Prince George and his mother as they flew out to Mustique for the baby's first foreign holiday left a confidential file behind when they got off the plane. Two Metropolitan Police officers accompanied the Duchess of Cambridge and some of her family - minus Prince William, who stayed behind to study in Cambridge - on a scheduled British Airways flight from Gatwick to St Lucia last month. When they got off to board a private jet for the island of Mustique, where the Middleton family have rented a £5million villa, one of the officers left the dossier behind. A royal protection officer accompanying Kate and Prince George, pictured on their way to Mustique, left secret documents on the BA jet they took from Gatwick to St Lucia, it emerged today . The private villa where Prince George spent his first overseas holiday is staffed with its own butler and chef . BA cabin crew handed it to management who made sure it was returned to the Royal Protection Officer. A Scotland Yard spokesman told MailOnline this morning: 'On 25 January a Metropolitan Police Service officer left some documents on a plane. 'The documents were returned to the officer by airline staff. 'The papers didn't contain any classified documents and the circumstances of the loss are currently being looked into.' Six-month-old George travelled to the Caribbean with his mother, uncle James Middleton, and royal bodyguards on a 747 jumbo jet, and was said to have behaved impeccably during the 8,500-mile . flight. Pictured on arrival at St Lucia, the baby was dressed in a summery blue and white romper suit with matching sun-hat. The party, including Kate’s parents, Michael and Carole, sister Pippa and brother James, stayed at a four-bedroom villa staffed by a . butler, chef, housekeeper and gardener, with an outdoor dining area . overlooking the sea, as well as a lush tropical garden. Space: The villa, one of a cluster of private dwellings, has upper and lower decks, a gazebo and four bathrooms . Mustique has become a favourite destination for the Middleton family who were celebrating Carole's birthday . Smartly decorated in crisp whites and tasteful tropical prints, the villa was filled with flowers, candles and every electronic device for the convenience of the royal mother and son. Designer built in the 1970s and refurbished a few years ago,  it has four bathrooms, upper and lower decks and a gazebo for extra hot days. It is believed the Duchess' parents and sister, Pippa, were already waiting on Mustique at the villa which normally rents for £8,500 a week. The holiday was in part organised to celebrate Mrs Middleton’s 59th birthday last week, but the future king remained behind in England where he is halfway through a 10-week agricultural course being taught at Cambridge University. Mustique has become a favourite holiday destination of the millionaire Middleton family, who made their fortune selling party good on the internet. It boasts one small hotel and just 74 villas - one of which once belonged to the Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, a gift from her former suitor, Colin Tennant, who bought the entire island in the mid-20th century for just £45,000.

"By . Tom Gardner . NHS chiefs at one of Britain’s worst hospitals have come up with a bizarre strategy for improving patient care - allowing staff to use Twitter and Facebook on the wards. Bosses at . United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust (ULHNT) decided to unblock social networks for doctors and nurses on all computers just days after Sir Bruce Keogh named and shamed it for having unacceptably high mortality rates. Patient safety campaigner Julie Bailey, who helped expose the horrific neglect at Stafford Hospital . which cost up to 1,400 lives - including her own mother - blasted the decision. Critical: Julie Bailey, left, blasted the . decision to allow doctors and nurses to access social networking sites . while on the wards - especially in hospitals criticised in a damning . report by Sir Bruce Keogh, right . The founder of Cure the NHS . pressure group said: ‘This raises serious concerns. I just can’t see the . point of it. They should be spending time with patients. 'Patients . should be the priority. And while they’re spending time on Twitter and . Facebook that doesn’t indicate that’s what they going to be doing. ‘It’s particularly disappointing to hear this NHS trust is doing this given their history of treating patients.’ ULHNT was recently put in special measures after it emerged as one of 11 failing NHS Trusts. It is also the same trust which paid £500,000 to gag a whistleblower from revealing details about patient safety concerns. Yet now staff in Lincoln are encouraged to use Twitter and Facebook from hospital computers 'for their own communications'. An email, which was sent from the . Trust’s Communications Team on July 29, highlighted a scheme of ‘quick . wins’ to improve performance across its ailing hospitals. It told staff: 'We have taken the . step to open up all social media websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, . for use by Trust staff. 'From now on, you will be able to access these websites from all Trust computers.' Changes: Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire, pictured, is one of the sites where nurses will be able to access Facebook and twitter while on the wards . The policy was one of the first repsonses to the announcement that the Trust was named as one of the worst in Britain in the damning Keogh review. The move means doctors and nurses can post on sites such as Facebook and Twitter during work hours, sparking fears they could be distracted from treating patients. Before the Keogh review was published, ULNHT staff could not access social networks on hospital networks. A hospital worker, who did not want to be named, said: 'Managers say it’s to help staff communicate between hospitals but that’s rubbish. We already have an internal email and computer system funded at great expense by the taxpayer which we can use for that. 'The last thing this hospital and its patients need is staff getting distracted by Facebook and Twitter whilst at work. 'It's hard to see how staff can focus on change at the same time as being allowed to fritter away time on social media.These computers are all over the wards. 'Previously Twitter and Facebook were blocked but now they’re unblocked, it doesn’t make any sense. But a Trust spokesman defended the move, saying it was intended to promoted 'openness and transparency' within the organisation. A spokeswoman said: 'It is not unusual for NHS Trusts to make social networking sites available for their staff. 'We made the decision to open up access to social networking sites as a result of staff feedback that we needed to explore new ways of ensuring effective communication with our employees across four hospital sites. 'This is one of many actions taken to improve communication with staff and to encourage a culture of trust, openness and transparency within the organisation.' ULHNT was rated among the worst of 11 Trusts placed under ‘close watch’ after Sir Bruce Keogh’s review into hospital death rates was published in July this year. Inspectors found there had been 12 ‘never’ events - potentially life-threatening but avoidable mistakes - within the trust. ULHNT announced this week it was to hire dozens of foreign nurses after staffing levels were criticised. A former NHS hospital chief turned whistleblower was paid £500,000 in a ‘supergag’ deal to prevent him discussing his concerns about patient safety. Gary Walker, pictured right, said he was asked to ‘compromise the safety of patients in order to achieve Government targets’ at the United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust where he worked. Tory MP Stephen Phillips compared the situation to the scandal at Mid Staffordshire Trust where up to 1,200 patients died ‘unnecessarily’ because of the focus on targets. He said he suspected there has been a scandal of ‘similar proportions’ at United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust. Mr Walker, 42, was sacked from his £140,000-a-year post in February 2010 after allegations that he swore in meetings, but his supporters claimed it was a trumped-up charge. They said that prior to his dismissal, the chief executive – who rescued the Trust from £24.5million debts – had a serious disagreement with his superiors over the direction of health policies. He took his employers to a tribunal to claim unfair dismissal, but signed a deal with the Trust before the hearing was due to begin in April last year. The tribunal judge had already found evidence Mr Walker had made disclosures about patient safety, which were protected under whistleblowing laws. The patient mortality rate at the Trust, including the rate for emergency admissions, was above the expected rate for the last three years, according to an independent analysis. Mr Walker’s supporters told the Daily Mail the Trust paid him ‘hush money’ to prevent the public discovering that senior clinicians had raised concerns about risks to patients. David Bowles, a former chairman of the same Trust who resigned in 2009 over NHS targets, said he had also received a gagging letter after being called as a tribunal witness. He said: ‘The real question is if you sack somebody and you don’t pay them off, why do you spend £500,000 trying to cover up what they have to say?’","Staff at United Lincolnshire Hospital Trust urged to access sites while on wards .

"By . Sara Malm . Princess Anne has said that the focus of the opening celebrations of Olympic Games has moved away from the athletes and onto ‘excess’.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Across the globe, text slang is the bane of any teacher's life. But this Chinese college claims to have found a simple solution. Using makeshift canvas 'phone lockers', teachers now order pupils to deposit their mobiles before class starts, in a desperate bid to stamp new 'modern' words out of exam papers. Confiscated: Pupils are now phoneless in class at Luoyang Institute as they must deposit mobiles in these holders . Incredibly, pupils have taken to the system with glee - teachers claim. It may be a move worth considering by heads of schools in Britain, as hundreds of teachers continue to complain about students' diminishing language skills. Last month, a poll of 500 teachers in England and Wales found that many youngsters used colloquialisms in formal written work, with phrases such as 'Macbeth was pure mental' and 'Romeo was a numpty wasn't he?'. According to Zhao Jianli, dean of the Luoyang Institute, the simple fabric hangers have made all the difference. The lockers were introduced at the Luoyang Institute of Science and Technology, in Henan, China, after teachers said 'most pupils' were on Weibo (Chinese Facebook) 'most of the time' during lessons. Zhao Jianli, dean of the institute, said the 'visible reminder' encourages a 'studying atmosphere'. Zhou Jianli, dean of the college, said pupils are delighted with the system aimed at correcting their language . The school brought in the 'lockers' as they claimed phones were a danger to pupils' health and intelligence . She added: 'One only needs to look at the . new words that are coming up to describe the distractions the kids are . having, for example Phone Freak for someone who is obsessed with the . phone or Phubbing, which is snubbing the teacher by messing around on . the phone. 'We feel that this is damaging the kids development and also causes health problems. 'By having a very visible reminder as they walk into each class that when they start their studies they leave their phones behind, it has really helped improve the studying atmosphere within the school. Despite initial complaints, pupils now 'love' the system, which stops them messaging during lessons . 'The teacher has clear sight of the . phones as well and watches when the phones are taken and collected at . the beginning and end of each lesson to avoid any problems.' She added: 'I am not even convinced that having a class filled with 30 people and 30 phones and all giving off electro smog is particularly safe, I am sure it affects the ability to concentrate. 'The reaction has been great from the students, and although at the start there were some instances where people seemed to forget to switch off their phones everyone now seems to have it correct - and it's routine.'","Canvas phone holders hung at front of class in Luoyang Institute .

"By . James Rush . Created: . 07:50 EST, 14 June 2013 . Fathers4Justice campaigner Tim Haries has appeared in court accused of defacing a portrait of the Queen in Westminster Abbey . A Fathers4Justice campaigner appeared in court today accused of defacing a portrait of the Queen in Westminster Abbey. Tim Haries, 41, is alleged to have smuggled a can of spray paint into the abbey yesterday before defacing the picture. He appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged with criminal damage of more than £5,000. Asked by the court to enter a plea, Haries, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, said he was 'not in a position' to at that moment. He was released on conditional bail until the next hearing, at Southwark Crown Court on June 28, but banned from London in the meantime. The painting, by Ralph Heimans, which was put on public display last month, was damaged with paint yesterday lunchtime. The work, valued at around £160,000 and called The Coronation Theatre, Westminster Abbey: A Portrait Of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, has been removed from public display for repairs. Immediately after the damage was done, a picture was taken and the image was uploaded to the internet. Haries allegedly shouted ‘Fathers4Justice!’ when he was arrested. Chief magistrate Howard Riddle released Haries on conditional bail at the end of the 12-minute hearing, but said he must stay outside the M25 after police raised concerns that he would join an apparent Father’s Day protest in the capital planned for Sunday. Haries was supported by at least one Fathers4Justice activist in the public gallery, although the group said the act at Westminster Abbey was not an official protest. The portrait was designed to commemorate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and had only been on display in the Chapter House for a few weeks before it was vandalised. Appearing in court wearing blue jeans, a black T-shirt with a yellow motif and a leather jacket, Haries looked relaxed as he stood in the dock. He flashed a smile to a fellow Fathers4Justice campaigner who was sat in the public gallery with a sign which read 'No bail, hunger strike'. Malachy Pakenham, prosecuting, told the court: 'The police have concerns that it is Father’s Day this Sunday and he seems to belong to an organisation called Fathers4Justice and they are having a demonstration in London on Sunday. 'The police have concerns, bearing in mind the nature of this attack and the demonstration this Sunday.' Haries is separated from his wife, Jenny, and is in the midst of an access battle over his two daughters, aged 13 and ten. Protest: A portrait of the . Queen, left - commissioned by the Palace to mark the Diamond Jubilee - was . defaced at Westminster Abbey yesterday; the damage is pictured right . The oil painting, by Australian-born Ralph Heimans, had been on show in the Chapter House for only a few weeks. The portrait of the Queen pictures . her in a moment of quiet reflection as she stands on the spot in . Westminster Abbey where she was crowned 60 years ago. Fathers4Justice was founded in the UK by Matt O'Connor, a marketing consultant. Following separation from his wife in 2000, Mr O'Connor became a prominent critic of UK family law after a court barred him from seeing his young sons outside of a contact centre. F4J's stated aim is to champion the cause of equal parenting, family law reform and equal contact for divorced parents with children. It is well known for its campaigning techniques of dramatic protest stunts, usually dressed as comic book superheroes and frequently scaling public buildings, bridges and monuments. Stunts have included supporters storming courts dressed in Father Christmas outfits, clapping the Children’s Minister in handcuffs, and group member Jason Hatch climbing onto Buckingham Palace dressed as Batman. Source: Fathers4Justice . Artist Ralph Heimans said he sought . to capture 'her humanity' in the 9ft by 11ft portrait, commissioned by . the Palace to mark the Diamond Jubilee. Her majesty posed for an hour-long sitting in the Yellow Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace in March. Mr Heimans then imagined the dramatic backdrop – the Sacrarium at Westminster Abbey, also known as the Coronation Theatre. She stands on the Cosmati pavement – a . spot where every English monarch has been crowned since it was . commissioned by Henry III in the 13th century. Mr Heimans, said: 'I hope there is a degree of humanity uncommon in traditional Royal portraits. 'I wanted her expression to be open . to interpretation so that people could imagine what she was thinking at . that moment, but I think there is a sense of tenderness and soulfulness, . as well as nostalgia and contemplation. 'But there is also a suggestion of her inner strength. She has an extraordinary aura and a real energy and presence.' The painting is entitled The Coronation Theatre, Westminster Abbey: A Portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. A statement from the artist Mr Heimans was read out to the court in which he confirmed that the 11ft by 9ft painting was produced in 2012 during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year .

'This is the first case in India in which the death penalty has been given to convicts while the victim is alive,' he said. The . three men were found guilty last month of raping a call-center operator . at the same abandoned mill in July 2013, a month before the attack on . the photojournalist.

"By . Meghan Keneally . Anderson Cooper has revealed that he will not be inheriting any money from his wealthy mother, Gloria Vanderbilt. The heiress-turned-jeans designer and perfume developer is the great-great-great-granddaughter of the railroad tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt. Gloria, who is now 90-years-old, has an estimated personal wealth of about $200million but her youngest son Anderson is not expecting to get any of that when she dies. Cool mom: Anderson Cooper said that his mother Gloria is 'the coolest person I know' and he is totally accepting of her plans not to leave him any of her fortune as an inheritance (seen together in 2010) 'My mom's made clear to me that there's no trust fund. There's none of that,' the CNN anchor told Howard Stern on his radio show. 'I don't believe in inheriting money... I think it's an initiative sucker. I think it's a curse. 'Who's inherited a lot of money that has gone on to do things in their own life? From the time I was growing up, if I felt that there was some pot of gold waiting for me, I don't know that I would've been so motivated.' The 46-year-old journalist makes a reported $11million per year as a result of his CNN contract. He lives in a multi-million dollar converted firehouse in New York City's Greenwich Village and also has two neighboring Hamptons homes. Moving away from wealth: Gloria inherited money from her family's railroad fortune but Anderson (seen right with his mother, now-deceased brother Carter and father Wyatt in 1972) said that he chose to pay more attention to his father's humble beginnings . 'I'm doing fine on my own, I don't need any,' he said. During the radio interview with Stern, cooper maintained that he was totally accepting of the deal with his mother, telling the incredulous host that he has no idea what she will do with her money. Gloria has struggled with her finances in the past, and sued her lawyer for $1.5million after he swindled money from her in 1993. She had to sell her seven-bedroom mansion in the wealthy resort town of Southampton as well as her five-story Manhattan townhouse in 1995 in order to pay off backtaxes. She moved in with Anderson at that point, when he was living in a two-bedroom apartment. Her fortune quickly returned in 2002 when she formally sold her company, Gloria Vanderbilt Apparel Corp, to Jones Apparel Group for $138million in 2002. She has also written three books since the mid-1990s and continues to run gallery openings and create her own artwork. In the Howard Stern interview, Anderson went on to say that he does not know how much is in his own personal savings account, but he tried to stay humble growing up by focusing more on his father's family than his mother's. Money earner: Cooper, 46, said that he makes enough money on his own that he is not concerned about an inheritance . 'I've never paid attention to it honestly like my dad grew up really poor in Mississippi- I paid attention to that because i thought thats a healthier thing to pay attention to than like some statute of a great great great grandfather who has no connection to my life,' he said. Anderson's father, Wyatt Emory Cooper, was Gloria's fourth husband and he died in 1978 from a heart attack when Anderson was just 9-years-old. Wyatt was 50 at the time of his death, and Anderson said that the looming big birthday is a fear of his, prompting him to start eating better. 'Yeah I think I have like three years left,' the 46-year-old said. Stern went on to bring up the controversy surrounding Alec Baldwin and his use of homophobic language last year which prompted a reprimand from Cooper via Twitter. In subsequent interviews, Baldwin blamed part of the backlash on Cooper saying that the openly gay journalist was ‘the self-appointed Jack Valenti of gay media culture’ but Cooper used the radio interview as a chance to both stand by his earlier assertions and support the scandal-trodden actor. ‘I like Alec Baldwin, I think he’s incredibly talented, I think he’s incredibly smart,’ Cooper said while clearly taking a nervous term. ‘When he called the person a cocksucker, and then said he didn't know “c*******er” was an anti-gay — I mean, what adult does not know calling a guy a “c*******er” (is an insult). ‘The worst thing you can possibly think of to say, which is what this situation was, to talk about a sexual act between two guys as being the worst thing you can possibly think of. That seems to indicate— but I never said he was homophobic. I have no idea what's in his head.’","The CNN host's mother Gloria Vanderbilt inherited millions from her relative's development of the American railroad system .

"By . Rachel Reilly . Despite its reputation, stress can cause us to lead a healthier lifestyle, according to a new research. Five experiments showed that while stress can cause some people to overeat or indulge in a spending spree, it can cause just as many people to do more exercise or eat healthily, too. Scientists found that people tend to rely on the habits they have already formed rather than automatically turning to destructive behaviour when put under pressure. The findings suggest that we do not have . finite resources for self-discipline and that in fact we can control . ourselves just as much when stressed as when relaxed. Scientists found that people rely on the habits they have already formed rather than automatically turning to destructive behaviour when put under pressure. Gym goers turn to exercise to get them through tough times . 'When we try to change our behaviour, we . strategise about our motivation and self-control,' said Wendy Wood, Provost Professor of Psychology and Business at University of Southern California. 'But what we should be . thinking about instead is how to set up new habits. Habits persist even . when we're tired and don't have the energy to exert self-control.' Wood is a leading expert on . habit, the automatic behaviours that make it possible for us to function each day. Learned habits also play a big role in . our health -  research has shown that exercise, overeating and smoking are . significant risk factors for major diseases. But while most disease prevention . efforts focus on self-control, the latest research from Wood shows that . the best way to prevent disease might be knowing how to let go: 'Everybody gets stressed. 'The focus on controlling your behaviour . may not actually be the best way to get people to meet goals. If you are somebody who doesn't have a lot of willpower, our study . showed that habits are even more important.' In one experiment Professor Wood and colleagues followed students for a term, including during . exams. Stress is traditionally associated with increased smoking and drinking but just as many people engage in healthy behaviour to get through stress. Research has shown that learned habits play a large role in our present and future health . They found that during exams, when students were . stressed and sleep-deprived, they were even more likely to stick to old . habits. It was as if they didn't have the energy to do something new, Professor . Wood explained. Students who ate unhealthy breakfasts . during the term â€“ such as pastries or doughnuts â€“ ate even more of . the junk food during exams. But the same was true of healthy eaters: . those in the habit of eating a healthy breakfast were also more likely . to stick to their routine and ate especially well in the morning when under . pressure.# . Similarly, students who had a habit of . reading the newspaper everyday during the term were more likely to perform this habit during exams â€“ even when . they were limited in time. And regular gym-goers were even more likely . to go to the gym when stressed. 'You might expect that, when students . were stressed and had little time, they wouldn't read the paper at all, . but instead they fell back on their reading habits,' said Wood. 'Habits . don't require much willpower and thought and deliberation.' Wood concluded: 'So, the central . question for behaviour change efforts should be, how can you form . healthy, productive habits? 'What we know about habit formation is that . you want to make the behaviour easy to perform, so that people repeat it . often and it becomes part of their daily routine.' All five experiments appeared in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.","Studies published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, found existing lifestyle determined what people do to cope under pressure .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A Cornell University student has made a series of painful conclusions in his research into stings by letting honey bees attack his own body. Michael Smith subjected himself to several stings a day to his face, arms and genitals to map out what section of the body was most sensitive to the barbs. After weeks of research Smith found that although stings to his penis and testicles were uncomfortable, the worst place for a bee to attack was the nostril. Science of stings: Cornell student Michael Smith researched the most painful places for a bee to attack . His usual idea for the study came about when the bee enthusiast was discussing the problems of working with hives with his academic adviser. 'We speculated it probably really would . hurt to get stung in the testicles. Two days later, by . chance, I did get stung there. It didn't hurt as much as I expected it . to,' he told the Independent. Smith measured the stings with a pain rating of 1 for mild and 10 for extremely painful: . 1) Nostril  - 9.0             6) Cheek - 7.0 . 2) Upper lip - 8.7          7) Armpit - 6.7 . 3) Penis - 7.3               8) Nipple - 6.7 . 4) Scrotum - 7.0              9) Middle finger tip - 6.7 . 5) Palm - 7.0               10) Abdomen - 6.7 . Intrigued by his 'eureka' moment, Smith chose 25 locations on his body to measure the level of pain. He then held a bee to those areas and allowed it to sting him. Like all scientific studies he needed to repeat his experiment several times so, over the course of 38 days, he administered five stings a day. Each body part was stung three times during the experiment, and the pain level was given a mark out of 10. Because the experiment needed a control, he also had to let a bee sting his forearm at the start and end of each day's research. His research raised some unusual problems, including being able to maneuver a bee to the more hard-to-reach body parts. 'Some locations required the use of a . mirror and an erect posture during stinging (e.g., buttocks),' he wrote . in his study, which has been published in PeerJ. The . results were surprising, with Smith finding that although stings to the . genitals were painful, there were worst places to be stung. 'There’s . definitely no crossing of wires of pleasure and pain down there. But if . you’re stung in the nose and penis, you’re going to want more stings to . the penis over the nose, if you’re forced to choose,' he told National . Geographic. Experiment: Smith held bees to his body so he could research the most painful sites for stings . Pain map: To be sure of his results, Smith administered three bee stings to 25 locations on his body . 'I really don't want to get sting in the . nose again – that's not fun. Your body really reacts. You're sneezing, . wheezing. Your eyes are streaming,' he added. Smith admitted that there were times when he regretted embarking on his experiment, and said he was glad his supervisor, Tom Seeley, had talked him out of testing stings to the eyes. 'He was concerned that I might go blind. I wanted to keep my eyes,' Smith said. The graduate's fascination with bees . has formed the basis of his research at Cornell's Department of . Neurobiology and Behavior, where he is studying honeybee colonies. While . studying molecular biology at Princeton in 2009 he founded the . Princeton University Bee Team, which has led to the creation of two . hives on the university campus. He also runs the College Beekeeper group, which advises students on how to get hives up and running. Dedication: Smith, a graduate student researching hive colonies, also promotes beekeeping at universities . While measuring pain is subjective, and the study used only one person's measure of pain, Smith has no plans to further his research into bee stings. 'I didn’t see a lot of merit in repeating this with more subjects,' he said. And for those wanting to avoid accidentally repeating his experiment, Smith advised: 'If you have a bee buzzing around you and . you think it's peeved, if you calm down, don't breathe a lot – they are . attracted to carbon dioxide – and slowly walk away, you will be fine. Most stings are probably wasps.'","Each body part was stung 3 times to measure level of pain .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A Miami woman faces up to 40 years in jail after being charged with an unthinkable crime – killing animals while performing sex acts for fetish videos. Sara Zamora, 28, decapitated chickens, beat rabbits to death and more for sexual gratification, Miami-Dade Police claimed. The sickening videos were filmed at the Homestead home of Adam Redford, 54, of Homestead, said cops. He declined comment when reached by MailOnline. Partners in crime?: Sara Zamora's (left) video is said by police to have been shot on the property of Adam Renford (right), he has yet to be charged but has a prior animal cruelty conviction . An arrest report cited by the Miami Herald details the horrors carried out by Zamora and others in a video called ‘SOS Barn.’ Zamora and other women were shown in the the video ‘torturing and killing a wide variety of animals, including chickens, rabbits and more for the sexual gratification of its viewers,’ said the report. The mortifying video is part of a genre of pornography called ‘crush,’ according to the paper. Fetish model: Zamora's stage name Gloria Shynez is listed on many websites saying she is available for fetish, nude or custom modeling . Zamora is said by police to have been groping a man’s genitals with her left hand while ‘repeatedly cutting a chicken’s neck using hedge clippers with her right’ in one video. Other videos had her scantily clad while ‘hacking off the head of another screaming bird, or [beating] chickens to death with a wooden stick.’ She is also shown karate-chopping the necks of rabbits while they howled in pain, police said, adding that she admitted to killing them. ’I’m glad I didn’t have breakfast because I would have puked all over the place,’ the woman’s defense attorney told the paper after he viewed portions of the video in court. ‘It was disgusting.’ Redford was already on parole for a similar animal cruelty violation last year, he has yet to be charged in the heinous crimes. The ship captain’s website boasts that he has ‘been a part of many video productions related to South Florida fishing.’ Zamora’s Model mayhem profile, in which she goes by Gloria Shynez, talks up her ‘Middle-Eastern look,’ which she says ‘distinguishes from many models. ‘I am so excited to see what fun, beautiful shots we create together!’ Other Florida listings for a Gloria Shynez appear on Tampa Foot Party, tickle fetish sites and on another site that claims she ‘is a hot model available for nude and fetish custom videos.’ Her rates are flexible and she is ‘extremely easy to work with,’ according to her Model Mayhem profile. Zamora was was hit with eight felony counts of animal cruelty, each carries a maximum five year prison sentence if convicted. She was already on parole for a litany of criminal charges including grant theft with a firearm, multiple counts of credit card fraud, holding a fake driver’s license and multiple drug possession counts, records showed. The repeat offender had been in jail for the past month after violating the terms of her parole by failing a drug test, according to the paper. She was due to be set free and was arrested only hours before her scheduled release.","Police say Sara Zamora mutilated and beat to death chickens while performing sex acts on camera .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Two South Carolina sisters have had their illegal in-home day cares shut down within months of each other after a baby died while being cared for by one of them. Tracey Garrett was busted this week for running an unlicensed day care with 10 children. Sister Pamela Wood’s day care was shut down earlier this year after police responding to the death of a baby found nearly two dozen more children stashed in and around her home. Cops were shocked to find 14 children hiding in the basement, two more near a loaded gun and a toddler left alone outside, according to reports. Tragedy: Kelly Rynn Martin died while being cared for by pamela Wood, her death led to a series of shocking discoveries in the woman's home . Garrett’s husband had no clue she was watching the children illegally, and told WYFF his wife had been watching children for years. It is not clear what charges Garrett may face, but her sister was accused last month of multiple crimes after deputies rushed to her home after she reported an unresponsive baby and made a series of startling discoveries. Accused: Police say Pamela Wood neglected the children in her care, and had four times the amount her day care permit allowed . Wood, 49, called 911 Feb 21 after one of 23 children she was watching over was found unresponsive in a basinet, police said. She told police there were only six children in the home – likely because she was only licensed to supervise that many – but 14 were found stashed in the basement with her 16-year-old daughter, sources told Fox Carolina. An additional two children were discovered alone in a room in reach of a loaded gun, arrest warrants cited by the station said. A toddler was found alone in the backyard as well, cops said. Cleaning fluids, alcohol and a working toaster were found on the floor, a counter or in cabinets in reach of even a crawling baby that had no childproof locks, police said. The woman is also accused by officials of lying about the baby’s death and making other statement s aimed at hindering any investigative efforts made by authorities. Police said that stuffed animals and blankets found in the bassinet with Kelly Rynn Martin after she died have spurred them to look into whether it was sleeping in unsafe conditions. They charged her with obstructing justice, violation of day care licensing and unlawful neglect of a child. House of horrors: Nearly two dozen children were found in dangerous conditions both inside and outside Wood's home, police said . Only five miles away: Sister Tracey Garrett was also running an illegal day care . The incident has sparked a fire in residents concerned about the quality of care their children receive. ‘When Kellie Rynn passed away, we never really knew the difference between a licensed and registered day care, and we want parents to know,’ Kathryn Martin told WYFF. ‘There are too many dangers out there that can happen to any family.’ Another woman who trusted Wood to watch her baby is also angered. ‘We loved them, we considered them our family,’ Katie Gresham added. ‘It makes you feel like a horrible parent when you think you have done everything possible to make sure that your kids are safe, and then to find out everything that you thought they were in is not what it seemed.’","Tracey Garrett's illegal day care out of her home was shut down this week .

Princeton Harlan, 18, who has garnered interest from six colleges across the southeast to play football, was charged with two other team-mates for child rape in Mount Pleasant, Tennessee on Wednesday. Harlan, who was released on $100,000 bail, stands accused of having sex with a 12-year-old girl who fell pregnant in July and terminated the pregnancy, authorities said. Yet while the alleged sex was consensual, the trio has been charged with child rape as the state rules anyone under the age of 13 cannot consent to sex. If convicted, . they face 25 years in prison. Arrest: Princeton Harlan, a star quarterback at his Tennessee high school, has been charged with child rape after he allegedly had sex with a 12-year-old girl who fell pregnant . The rural town, home to 4,561 residents, has been left shocked by the charges. 'Itâ€™s really devastating,' Wendall Holder, a 1989 Mt.

He had a lot ahead of him, and he had set some passing records here at Mt. Pleasant.' Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Auburn, . Kentucky, Mississippi State and Cincinnati have shown interest in the . 6-foot-4, 188-pound senior quarterback, the paper reported. Holder, who knows Harlan and the . family of the 12-year-old, added: 'It's traumatic for what's happened for . her. For both parties involved it's pretty hard.' Destroyed future: Harlan's football skills have garnered interest from six colleges across the southeast . Accused: Police began investigating Harlan and two of his teammates after the girl told her mother she was pregnant. They allegedly had consensual sex with her on separate occasions . Another local, Wayne McWright, called the news 'alarming'. 'It's a tragedy more so for the young girl,' he said. 'Then also my heart goes out to the young fellow, too, because somehow he got off track. Young people sometimes do foolish things.' Ed Brennan, who owns a building on Main Street that houses the Helping Hands Mission in Mt. Pleasant, said the charges had shaken the small town. 'If you hear about (something like this) in Nashville, it's kind of, ""Well, that kind of stuff goes on up there"",' he said. 'If you hear it down here, these are supposed to be good Christian people. 'We're a tight-knit little family. Everybody knows each other. We're missing the kids in church and maybe . this will drive them back into the church where they belong. I hope it . does.' Harlan was released from jail on Wednesday after posting $100,00 bail. He will be arraigned November 5. Changed future: The community on Mt Pleasant has been left shocked by the charges against the sports star . School: He was arrested without incident outside his high school, pictured, and released on bail . Authorities began investigating Harlan and two other suspects, a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old, last month after the girl told her mother she thought she was pregnant, WKRN reported. She was four-and-a-half weeks pregnant when the pregnancy was terminated, authorities said. They have not given any indication on who fathered the child. The teenagers allegedly had sex with the girl on separate occasions in July but police would not reveal how they met the child. Harlan was arrested without incident outside the high school.

Megan McKeon, 24, has been charged with child abuse resulting in death after leaving her son, Austin Davis, home alone in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, for 20 years and then returning to find him dead . Investigators say McKeon's home, described as a cabin at a local campground, was in chaos, with human waste and partially eaten food tossed around . McKeon, 24, tried to plead guilty to three misdemeanor counts in court on Thursday, but District Attorney dropped those and instead charged her with child abuse resulting in death, a felony who carries a much longer sentence. According to police, McKeon left to go to work at a local supermarket on Wednesday, March 26 and didn’t return until Thursday morning, March 27. McKeon told detectives she had left . food, juice and a movie playing for her son. She also told detectives she had . left him home alone on a regular basis, about 20 times before. After her shift, McKeon reportedly spent the night at the home of an unnamed boyfriend before heading home the next morning, reports Denver Westworld. When the prosecutors dropped the original charges against McKeon, Charity O'Konski, the dead boy’s grandmother shouted, ‘She killed a baby' The boy's father, Tyler Davis, 22, was in prison at the time of Austin's death after he was arrested for not registering as a sex offender . When the prosecutors dropped the original charges against McKeon, Charity O'Konski, the dead boy’s grandmother shouted, ‘She killed a baby,' reports CBS4. Outside court O’Konski said she would have been happy to care for Austin if she had known the circumstances. 'All she had to do was call me. There’s no if, ands or buts to what happened, it’s her fault no matter what happened. She is accountable for that baby,' said O’Konski. 'Nothing is ever going to be enough, because he will never come back to us but she took his life away and the only way to take her life away is to let her sit behind those bars and let her think about what she did.' A doctor who tried to save Austin’s life was concerned the boy possibly had ingested prescription medication or other substances . A guilty plea to the original charges would have only carried a maximum sentence of 42 months. The . district attorney said that would not be sufficient punishment for the . crime so he dropped the charges. He hopes to file felony child abuse . resulting in death charges against McKeon. The district attorney is waiting for an official cause of death for Austin. The coroner and investigators are waiting for toxicology reports to come back which will take at least two weeks.

KOMO News . reports that court documents detail how Powell allegedly engaged in sex . with a then 17-year-old student in her class after he asked her about . raising his math grade. The new victim confessed to his mother after she noticed a change in his behavior and saw the story about Powell on the news. Detectives interviewed the unidentified victim last week. The district is devising a support plan for each student and their family, including counseling. 'These are very difficult circumstances for the victims and their . families, so we design a custom plan for each student based on their . particular needs,' Dan Voelpel with the Tacoma School District.

"By . Alex Greig . A Michigan couple have managed to smuggle their newly adopted daughter out of Crimea just after Russia officially annexed the state. Kristine Proctor was waiting for the final pieces of paperwork to be filed for her and husband James's adoption of a 16-year-old orphan called Yana when Russian troops flooded the streets and a referendum decided that Crimea would become a part of Russia. Although the official unification wasn't immediate, bureaucrats stopped issuing the documents the Proctors needed to remove Yana, who has since renamed herself Melissa, from her orphanage and the region. Reunited: Kristine and James Proctor with their newly adopted daughter Melissa . With James Proctor returned to work in the United States, Kristine Proctor enlisted the help of Inna, a Ukrainian woman, to help her and Melissa escape the area. 'It was terrifying,' Kristine Proctor told ABC News on Friday, just hours before flying home to Michigan. 'We've had a lot of miracles.' As pro-Russian crowds marched, denouncing the Ukraine's Western supporters, Kristine Proctor became increasingly frantic. Inna finally managed to procure a tax identification number for Melissa, after one refusal after another from bureaucrats unwilling to issue a passport for the orphan. Uncertain future: The Proctors met Melissa when she was almost 16 - the age at which she would have aged out of the Ukrainian orphanage system and been left to fend for herself . Adoptive parents: James and Kristine Proctor have adopted children from the Ukraine before . The document enabled them to buy a . rail ticket to Kiev and the three boarded the train just hours before . Russia completed its annexation of Crimea. As they approached the border, armed soldiers boarded the car, asking the conductor if there were any foreigners aboard. He indicated Melissa and Kristine were Americans. The soldiers, miraculously, asked no further questions and the train continued on its way to Kiev. 'When . the train came into the station [in Kiev], Inna and I looked at each . other and started crying,' Proctor said. 'We were in survival mode and . it all hits you.' The . Proctors, who have adopted several other children from the area in the . past, met Melissa in December, when she was just short of her 16th . birthday - the age at which she would age out of Ukraine's orphanage . system and be left to fend for herself. New daughter: The Proctors say Melissa is bright and confident and believe she will thrive in the United States . The connection was instant and the couple felt sure the 'smart, fun' teen would thrive in their family. However, their battle wasn't over once Kristine and Melissa reached Kiev, as officials demanded she be returned to Crimea and refused to issue a passport. Finally, after days of bureaucratic back and forth, Melissa was granted a passport and flew to her new home with her new mother on Saturday. ABC News reports that other adoptions that were in progress in Crimea have been halted. According to advocates, it's unlikely Russia will allow any adoptions by Americans to proceed.","Kristine and James Proctor went to Crimea to adopt a 16-year-old orphan, Melissa .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . Two Detroit teenagers . were arrested Saturday in an attack on a suburban man who was brutally . beaten by a mob after accidentally striking a boy with his pickup truck. Investigators . believe the 17-year-old and 16-year-old males had a direct role in the . beating of Steve Utash, said Sgt. Mike Woody, a Detroit police . spokesman. Utash remained in critical condition Saturday, three days after the attack on the city's east side. Loving husband: Steve Utash, pictured with wife Starr Utash, was beaten into a life-threatening coma after he accidentally ran over a young boy . He's going to survive: David Harris, 10, suffered only a broken leg after running into traffic . Group of friends: Four individuals are shown . standing by the side of the road at left and Harris can be seen darting . head on into traffic at right . Woody . said no charges would be immediately filed against the teens while . investigators continue their work. Police believe at least six people . may have been involved. 'We still have a long . way to go. I've been reminding people we're still at the very beginning . stage of this investigation,' the sergeant said. The case has outraged the public, clergy and elected officials. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan called the attack 'senseless.' Utash, . 54, of Clinton Township accidentally struck a 10-year-old boy with his . pickup Wednesday. A mob swarmed him as he checked the boy, whose . injuries were not life-threatening. A . prominent black pastor, the Rev. Horace Sheffield III, called on the . public to go block by block to find the 'heartless perpetrators.' It's . important for community members 'to prove that we equally deplore . justice and unbridled brutality no matter what color the victim is or of . the one committing it,' Sheffield said in a statement. Utash is white; Detroit is more than 80 percent black. Utash's family said more than $50,000 has been raised for his medical bills. The tree trimmer has no medical insurance. Family man: Utash is a married father of two children - the relatives pictured are not identified . Moment of impact: Utash hits David Harris just after the boy ran into the street . On the ground: The young boy is crumpled in heap on the ground just after being hit . Released from the hospital: Harris suffered only a broken leg, he has already been sent home . 'I . never expected this. ... The whole nation is rooting for him to wake up . and be OK,' his daughter, Mandi Emerick, told The Detroit News. The gang also stole his wallet before leaving him for dead. 'If it went on any longer, my dad wouldn’t be in the hospital right now, he would be in the morgue,' son Joseph Utash told CBS Detroit. Security . footage from a gas station Harris and friends were standing in front of . shows him inexplicably running into oncoming traffic before being mowed . down by Utash's vehicle. Utash . immediately stops to check on the boy, but several black males from . their late teens to their early 20s quickly descend on the scene. Police quickly ruled the incident an accident. 'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any chance of stopping,' Moreno explained. But what happened next is considered by Utash's family to be an act of retaliation. Police . tell MailOnline that about a dozen young males attacked the married . father of three, beating him into a coma that he still hasn't woken from. 'It’s not like he hit the kid on purpose and they were trying to get revenge,' daughter Felicia Utash told WXYZ. 'He literally just tried to stop and help the kid and people came out of nowhere and tried to kill him.' Mob rule: The angry mob that would soon mercilessly beat Utash begins gathering where the boy was struck . Devastated: Daughter Felicia Utash (pictured) insists her father was doing the right thing, that he did not deserve his fate . His son Joseph Utash hinted it might have been a setup to rob his father, perhaps even a hate crime. 'I . think it was all a setup from the gate,' he told CBS Detroit. 'My dad’s . been driving up and down Morang for 15, 16 years working for the same . company... they know he has money and they robbed him. 'As far as a hate crime, it might be,' he continued. 'You go in Detroit and you’re white, you don’t belong.' Police immediately dismissed the notion. 'We have no evidence to suggest it's a hate crime,' Moreno told MailOnline. The . boy's father was arrested after a background check revealed he has an . active warrant, according to the Detroit Free-Press, but police declined to say if he would be charged in . connection with the beating. Witnesses said Utash immediately pulled over to check on Harris after hitting him. ‘David was laying right in front of the . driveway and he had blood coming out of his mouth,’ James Duston Jr., . the boy’s godfather told WXYZ.  He couldn’t move his body.’ The crowd ran towards the boy's screams and mercilessly beat Utash. ‘This little boy was screaming,’ a woman told the Free Press. ‘There was a lot of people that came out. It was crazy.’ All hell broke loose. ‘I think it lasted about one minute and . then they let him go,’ a bystander told WXYZ. ‘And then they jumped back . on him again and they did it about three times and finally someone was . trying to help the guy that got beat up.’ ‘He had the biggest gash on his head I . ever seen – he was bleeding from the mouth and he was unconscious when I . first got there,’ Debra Hughes told WWJ. Harris suffered a broken leg, he has since been released from a local hospital, Moreno said. A message left with the family seeking further comment has not yet been returned. Brutal beatdown: The unidentified driver was savagely beaten after stopping to check on the young boy he accidentally hit with while driving this pickup truck . ‘It was sad because I knew the guy was getting out of his car to try and see what damage he did,’ the witness added. ‘He got his,’ another witness to the beating told the Free Press. ‘He got beat up real bad.’Both the driver and the boy were taken to a local hospital. The boy’s family condemned the beating. ‘We don’t condone that at all,’ said Duston. ‘I told his mom and she just was like, no, we wouldn’t want that to happen.’ Doctors are still trying to determine if Utash will need surgery to save his life.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Search crews have found the bodies of a central Indiana woman and her five-year-old son, who were swept away after their vehicle became submerged in flood waters. Conservation officers recovered the bodies of 24-year-old Jana Payton and Bronson Liggett in a flooded field Saturday afternoon along the White River in Owen County. Conservation Officer Angela Goldman says the Paragon residents vanished in the early hours of Saturday morning after a friend who had been driving Payton's car left the pair, who could not swim, on the flooded car's rooftop and swam away to find help. Loving mother: Jana Payton and her son Bronson Liggett drowned after their car became stranded on a flooded road . Goldman says that the woman called 911 at a nearby home, but when she returned about 15 minutes later at 1:45am, Payton and her son were no longer with the car. Their bodies were found near the town of Gosport about 40 miles southwest of Indianapolis shortly after 4pm Saturday. The victims' family say they believe they became lost on the dark, flooded road. 'I think they just had minutes to decide what to do, and it wasn't the right decision,' Payton's cousin, Mary Finney, told ABC 6. Payton was a single mother of two children who held down two jobs, at a pizza parlor and a grocery store, to support her family. Rising tide: The pair climbed onto the roof of the car when the water began to rise, but had disappeared by the time help arrived . The tiny town of Paragon, home to just 659 residents, is shaken by the deaths. 'It will be a huge thing here,' Finney  said. 'Everybody knew her. And everybody loved her.' Finney described her cousin as affectionate, hardworking, positive and dedicated to her two sons, Bronson and his older brother, aged seven. 'They were inseparable,' she said of Payton and Bronson.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . The father of one of the victims of the horrific Fort Hood shooting has spoken of the tense hours between when his son was shot and when they finally learned he was still alive. Sgt. Jonathan Westbrook’s father Theodis Westbrook drove nearly halfway across the country after learning his son was one of 16 wounded during Specialist Ivan Lopez’s shooting spree. Three people also died during the rampage. He told ABC News of the emotional roller coaster he and his wife went on while waiting to hear the married father of three was still alive. His wife also spoke to the traumatic hours until hearing from the father of their three children. Injured: Sgt. Jonathan Westbrook was shot during the Fort Hood rampage . ‘I can’t tell you how happy I am as a dad, as the parent, that I am here to celebrate with my son… and not here to go the other way,’ the relieved father said. His son was shot four times – twice each in the arm and chest, he said. The worried father admitted thinking ‘how different it could have been’ during his 10 hour drive from Mississippi to the Texas Army base. ‘How much worst it could have been, how much worse the news could have been and how our lives would have been changed had it gone the other way,’ all crossed his mind, he said. Theodis Westbrook told of how he felt helpless as the shooting raged on. ‘Ever since my kids were very, very small, I was afraid that something [would] cause pain and hurt to them and I did everything in my power to prevent that…  for this to happen, it is the realization of the worst nightmare.’ Cocnerned: Theodis Westbrook, father of the injured soldier, said the wait to hear about his son was agonizing . Happy couple: Renee and Jonathan Westbrook have three children together . His soldier son served last year in Afghanistan, but the pain caused by the Fort Hood shooting is more than had anything happened during combat, the father said. ‘Bombs, missiles and all sorts of weapons used against him and he survived all of that and he came back here to a U.S. military installation that is secure and almost lost his life and got wounded. ‘It is just unbelievable.’ The injured soldier's wife, Renee Westbrook, said her husband did mainly administrative work after being blown several feet by a bomb while in Afghanistan. He suffered minor nerve damage and received treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder but was otherwise okay, she explained. Seven hours passed before Jonathan was able to contact his parents. ‘We walked the floor, we cried, we prayed,’ said Theodis Westbrook. ‘We had no information … we allowed ourselves to think the very worst.’ In memorial: Flowers hang at the East Gate of the army base Friday at Fort Hood . The Sergeant’s parents admitted that the longer time went by, the more they were convinced something very bad had happened. ‘We have just been to hell and back,’ he lamented. Jonathan finally was able to call his parents, he told them of the terrifying ordeal. ‘The very first person that was hit died,’ Theodis Westbrook said his son told him. ‘And, then the gun was turned on my son. People scrambled for cover, turning over desks and tables for protection, he was told. The shooter soon left and started randomly shooting people he encountered.

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated  Press Reporter . What started out as a birthday celebration Friday night ended in a tragedy when a car heading down a dark, dead-end street in a desolate industrial area of Queens, New York, flipped over a wooden curb into a creek, killing four passengers. The driver was somehow able to escape the sinking vehicle and told officers at the scene in the Astoria section of Queens that his four friends were trapped in the submerged car. Police said the 2009 Honda Accord tumbled into Steinway Creek, a trash-strewn inlet off the East River, just after 10.30pm Friday. One birthday, four funerals: Crystal Gravely (left) was out celebrating her 20th birthday with her friends, among them Jaleel Furtado (right), 20, when their car jumped the curb and landed in a dirty creek in Queens, NY .

The 20-year-old driver, Andrew Gramm, was listed in stable condition at Elmhurst General Hospital. A blood test showed that he had no alcohol in his system by the time he emerged from the creek and went for help. Police towed the mangled silver Honda from the creek this morning and deposited it on the pavement upside-down, just a few feet from the water's edge. They then flipped it back on its wheels and carted it away on a flatbed truck.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A new study finds restaurant reviews may be affected by the forecast on the day they were written. The study, conducted by researchers Saeideh Bakhshi, Partha Kanuparthy and Eric Gilbert looked at 840,000 restaurants and 1.1 million linked reviews between 2002 to 2011. 'Weather conditions are significantly associated with ratings,' the authors write. 'Reviews written on warm or cool days are more likely to be rated high than those written in cold or hot days. Reviews written on rainy or snowy days tend to have lower ratings than those written on days without rain or snow.' Will this restaurant get a good review? A new study says that reviewers tend to give higher marks on sunny days between 70 and 100 degrees . 'The best reviews are written on sunny days between 70 and 100 degrees,' Bakshi said in a press release. 'Science has shown that weather impacts our mood, so a nice day can . lead to a nice review. A rainy day can mean a miserable one.' Diners also tend to give lower ratings to restaurants in July and August. 'People love to describe themselves as foodies. But in the end, it looks like weâ€™re all weather people, whether we realize it or not,' Bakshi said in the release. The authors also cited a previous study, which said that weather can influence the tips patrons leave at a restaurant, as well as the self-reported mood of waitresses. They even said neighborhood diversity, education levels and population density may impact reviews. Areas where more than 50 percent of the population have college degrees have on average nearly three times as may reviews than places where less than 10 percent graduated, they said. Ice-cold reviews! The study found that reviews written on rainy or snowy days tend to have lower ratings than those written on days without rain or snow . In busier cities, patrons are reportedly more patient with wait times and expect delivery options. In smaller cities, carryout service was viewed more positively than delivery -- but the authors say reviewers were harsher on service. Even region seems to play a role in the number of reviews. 'We also found that restaurants in the Northeast and Pacific get more reviews than places in the South and Midwest,' Bakshi said. 'I think the difference between the South and Pacific comes mostly from the differences in education, diversity and liberal versus conservative. Blue states such as California, Washington and Oregon have a higher number of reviews per restaurant.' Restaurant owners may end up taking the reviews with a grain of salt. 'You can plan the best wedding or birthday party. Restaurants can serve great food and provide spectacular service,' Kanuparthy said in the release. 'But no one can control the weather. In the end, you canâ€™t beat Mother Nature.'","Study looked at 840,000 restaurants and 1.1 million linked reviews over 9-year period .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Two young children were accidentally shot to death by similarly-aged relatives this weekend in Georgia, authorities said. Police say Montrez Burroughs, 11, of Jacksonville, was shot by a 12-year-old relative Friday night while visiting relatives in Savannah. Taylor Jowers, 10, of Waycross, Georgia, was reportedly shot dead at home by her brother. Both victims were shot in the chest. No adults were around in either instance, according to reports, but charges have been filed only in the Savannah shooting. Both gunned down: Montrez Burroughs (left) was shot dead by a young relative playing with a gun, police said. Taylor Jowers (right) died after her brother accidentally fired a shotgun into her chest, according to reports . Burroughs was shot around 9.00 p.m. Friday night across the street from the home he was staying at in West Savannah. He and his mother had just moved from the coastal Georgia town to Jacksonville, but were in town for the weekend visiting family, relatives told WTOC. He and his suspected shooter often played together. The playmates were playing with a fake gun prior to finding a real one, cousin Denisha Coppock said, adding she had seen him shortly before his killing. ‘Your life is precious like that, it can be taken away just like that, because I just seen him 15 minutes before that, and it happened so fast,’ she said. Video Source WTOC . Inconsolable: Burroughs' relatives cried uncontrollably while police scoured the scene Friday night for evidence . Where it happened: The Savannah home where Burroughs was shot dead . The tragically killed boy loved to play sports. His Facebook profile is filled with pictures of him playing football. Family are upset the gun’s owner has not come forward to at the very least apologize to them for the boy’s death, and believe he should also be charged. ‘I think the parent and the child need to be charged,’ aunt Shaleena Hamilton told WTEV. ‘Because you have to take charge of your household and you have to be responsible for what goes on in your house.’ The accused shooter was charged with involuntary manslaughter, reckless conduct and possession of a firearm by a person under the age of 18, records showed. Reports have said the shooter was either a cousin or nephew. Also not clear is if the boy’s father will face any charges. A message the Savannah Police Department seeking further information has yet to be returned. 'It happened so fast': Burroughs' death happened only minutes after he was seen by relatives . Jowers’ death is equally negligent and tragic. Investigators have determined that she was asked by her 15-year-old brother to hold a 12-gauge shotgun while he made sure it wasn’t loaded, the Florida Times-Union reported. The gun accidentally discharged. The brother panicked and ran to a neighbor’s house for help. Scene of the tragedy: Jowers was shot dead in this Waycross home, police said . ‘He just said that his sister was shot,’ the neighbor told WJXT. ‘I called the ambulance and all the responders and everything got out here as fast as they could and tried to help her as much as they could.’ She was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. Jowers' parents were both working at the time she was shot, according to reports. A Ware County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson  declined to confirm or deny her brother was the suspected shooter, saying only that it is 'an older relative.' When asked whether an involuntary manslaughter or similar charge is being considered against the relative is being considered, the spokesperson said only that the incident is still under investigation.","Montrez Burroughs, 11, was shot dead by a 12-year-old relative .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . LPGA Tour Commissioner Mike Whan weighed in Friday on Golf Digest's provocative cover featuring Paulina Gretzky. 'Obviously, we're disappointed and frustrated by the editorial direction (and timing) Golf Digest has chosen with the announcement of its most recent magazine cover,' Whan said in a statement at the Kraft Nabisco Championship, the tour's first major tournament of the year. 'If a magazine called Golf Digest is interested in showcasing females in the game, yet consistently steers away from the true superstars who've made history over the last few years, something is clearly wrong... 'Growing the game' means a need for more role models and in these exciting times for women's golf, the LPGA is overflowing with them.'

Former LPGA Tour star Lorena Ochoa in 2008 was the last female pro to appear on the magazine's cover. Golf Digest featured Golf Channel's Holly Sonders in May 2013 and model Kate Upton posed with Arnold Palmer for the December issue. 'It's frustrating for female golfers,' third-ranked Stacy Lewis said. 'It's kind of the state of where we've always been. We don't get respect for being the golfers that we are. Obviously, Golf Digest is trying to sell magazines. But at the same time you'd like to see a little respect for the women's game.' Jerry Tarde, Golf Digest's editor in chief, released a statement about the cover. 'Sports figures, celebrities and models have appeared on Golf Digest covers since the magazine's beginning,' Tarde said. 'Paulina ranks at the high end of the golf celebrity scene today, and she has a compelling story to tell. She also might get some new people interested in the game.'

"By . Associated Press . Hundreds of Tetris fans had a little fun Saturday with a big version of the classic video game. The Philadelphia skyscraper-sized version created a spectacle against the night sky that organizers hoped inspired onlookers and players to think about the possibilities of technology. The 29-story Cira Centre, which has hundreds of LED lights embedded in its glass facade, normally displays colorful geometric patterns at night. On Saturday, images of supersized shapes 'fell' on two sides of the mirrored tower as competitors used joysticks to maneuver them into place. Building blocks: The classic video game Tetris is played on the 29-story Cira Centre in Philadelphia, Saturday April 5 . It wasn't the first time Tetris has been played on a building. But the 100,000-square-foot 'screen' - which includes the north and south faces of the structure - could be a record. City resident Sam Robinson, 30, said he signed up on a whim for the lottery to play because he figured 'it would be cool to play the world's largest game of Tetris.' 'It has been probably 15 years since I played Tetris last on a Game Boy, and it's much different playing on the side of building that's a half-mile away,' he said. 'Everything's happening so quick.'

"By . Snejana Farberov . When Jodi Gholson Oliver's 19-year-old told her that he was going to live as a transgender male, the Las Vegas mom took to Facebook to let her family and friends know how proud and accepting she was of her child. 'For about 18 1/2 years we thought he was a girl, who just happened to like bugs, tattoos, flames, skulls, snakes, lizards, etc, etc,' Mrs Gholson Oliver wrote on her Facebook wall March 27. Last September, Jesse Oliver, born 'Jessica' but known to everyone as 'Jes,' came to his parents and revealed that he's never felt like he was supposed to be a girl and always identified as a male. Proud mom: Jodi Gholson Oliver (left) wasted no time embracing her son Jes' (right) decision to live as a transgender male . Inspiring message: The Las Vegas mother of two wrote a smart and touching Facebook post letting her family and friends know that  her 19-year-old son is transgender . 'This is something that we have all seen over the years and I am so happy that he can finally feel like the person he was born to be!' Oliver's mother added. To drive the point home, the mother of two supplemented her post with a picture of a cartoon stork wearing an 'It's a Boy' cap. While the witty and heart-warming Facebook post was meant to simply keep Gholson Oliver’s family in the loop about a major development in her son's life, it quickly became much more than that, as Daily Dot first reported. The message has gone viral, drawing more than 150 ‘likes’ from loved ones and supportive strangers alike, who praised the Las Vegas hairdresser for embracing her child's life-altering decision. The mother, who has since joined the Gender Justice Nevada group, was surprised by the public’s reaction to her Facebook statement. ‘I had no idea this was going to affect so many people like it has,’ Gholson Oliver wrote in a follow-up post. ‘My hope is that in a short time this topic can just be small talk over coffee.’ Then and now: The Las Vegas teen was born Jessica Oliver (left) 19 years ago, but he has always known that his real gender was male . Transformation: Jes enjoys when people use male pronounces to address him, including his mother (right) and his girlfriend . Jes Oliver then shared his mother's message on his Tumblr page, adding, 'Heck yeah, mom,' at the bottom. The post quickly exploded online, and Oliver’s page has been overwhelmed with more than 150,000 comments from other Tumblr users. Over the past week-and-half, Oliver has been responding to questions from curious Internet users about what it means to be FtM transgender - female to male. Photos on Jes Oliver's Facebook and Tumblr account depict a masculine-looking teenager with piercing blue eyes, short dark hair and oval face with a cleft chin. He has an 18-year-old girlfriend, Hailey, who calls herself ‘Jesse’s girl’ on her social media account. Real identity: Jes Oliver got a new birth certificate late last year and has since begun going to gender therapy sessions . Although he was born with female reproductive organs, Jes Oliver has always known that it was the wrong gender for him. The 19-year-old also has a younger sister, Juliana. An old photo from their childhood, which Oliver shared online, shows the two sisters smiling into the camera, with Jes on the right rocking a black Harley-Davidson baseball cap turned backwards. In response to a question from a Tumblr user, the 19-year-old explained that when he was in the sixth grade in Missouri, where the family are originally from, he was pretending to be a boy on a drawing website and chatting with girls online. 'My mom found out and questioned it, but the conversation only went like “if you’re gay that’s okay me and dad still love you,”' Oliver wrote, adding that despite his parents’ positive attitude, he denied being gay 'to the end of time.' Then last September, the Las Vegas teen finally came out to his parents and friends as a transgender male. The family quickly set the wheels in motion, applying for an official name change. Last December, the former Jessica Oliver got a new birth certificate with the correct gender - male. The outspoken and inspiring young man, who describes himself as a ‘pretty decent dude,' has been blogging about the process of his transformation. Supportive: Miss Gholson Oliver has joined the Gender Justice Nevada group to raise awareness of transgender people like her son . A few months ago, Oliver began attending gender therapy sessions. The goal is for him to eventually obtain what is called a T letter - a letter of recommendation for hormone replacement therapy. One of the things he enjoys the most is when people use male pronounces when addressing him. Oliver was especially overjoyed when his mother took to referring to the teen as a ‘he.’ ‘The other day my mom told me she’s gonna start trying harder to use male pronouns and I’ve even heard her use ‘em when she’s around me,’ Jes Oliver gushed.  ‘Hot diggity dog, that’s cool.’","Jes Oliver, 19, was born Jessica, but says he's never felt like he was supposed to be a girl .

"By . Tara Brady . Mexican police have gone to extreme lengths to prove that one of the two remaining top leaders of the Knights Templar drug cartel has been killed by circulating a before and after picture. Monte Alejandro Rubido, the top official of the federal police, said suspected drug lord Enrique Plancarte died on Monday after marines spotted him walking down a street in the central state of Queretaro. Rubido said the marines called for him to stop but instead he tried to hide. Scroll down for video . Mexican police have circulated this before and after shot to prove that a boss of the Knights Templar cartel has been killed . When marines pursued him, he fired at them with a gun. After shooting Plancarte, the marines administered first aid, but he died soon after, Rubido said. His identity was proved by fingerprints and comparisons of photographs. Plancarte was considered one of four leaders of the Knights Templar cartel, which is based in Michoacan state. The gang has been chased out of many Michoacan towns by vigilante groups who have demanded authorities go after the gang's leaders. In recent weeks, Mexican security forces killed the gang's top capo, Nazario Moreno, and arrested Plancarte's uncle and Templars leader Dionisio Plancarte. Another leader Servando Gomez, known as 'La Tuta,' remains at large. Plancarte's identity was proved by fingerprints and comparisons of photographs . Mexican authorities had offered a reward of 10 million pesos ($767,000) for information leading to the arrest of Plancarte, 43. It was unclear what Plancarte was doing in Queretaro, a fairly quiet state neighbouring Michoacan. However, it confirmed fears that Knights Templar leaders and gunmen may have fled to nearby states following an offensive by federal forces and armed vigilantes to evict the cartel from Michoacan. On Monday, authorities announced they had arrested another leader of a vigilante 'self-defence' force in Michoacan and accused him of participating in the killing of a rival. Proof: Plancarte was considered one of four leaders of the Knights Templar cartel . It was the second such arrest in less than a month. The arrests come amid a broadening government crackdown on the vigilantes, who took up arms a year ago to fight the Knights Templar. The groups became popular in many towns because they were able to kick out the cartel, whose gunmen had demanded extortion payments from local residents, farmers and businesses. The vigilantes have demanded that authorities arrest the top leaders of the Knights Templar as a condition of laying down their weapons. The self-defence groups brought their own form of lawlessness to largely agricultural Michoacan, with rivalries, alleged thefts and possible links to a rival drug gang based in the neighbouring state of Jalisco.","Suspected drug lord Enrique Plancarte died on Monday .

The Prince, who started a desk job in London in January arranging ceremonial events,  remains qualified as an Apache pilot, having flown sorties against the Taliban in 2012-2013. He would need only to attend a brief refresher course before being sent back to Camp Bastion for a 12-week stint. Meanwhile, other shortages in the Armed Forces have triggered a rise in ‘Golden Hello’ one-off payments for personnel to stay in service. On top of their salaries, military nurses are being offered £20,000 and weapons engineers aboard submarines £50,000 to sign-on for an extra five years. This rise comes as a report by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body found that some privates in the Army fighting in Afghanistan are earning less than the National Minimum Wage (NMW). Troops’ pay starts at £17,767 a year and long working hours means they may earn less than the £6.31 an hour NMW for those over 21 and £5.03 an hour for those over 18. The report says: ‘It is possible for those on the lowest pay level to be earning below NMW levels if they work over 55 hours per week, for those aged 21 or over, or more than 68 hours per week if they are aged between 18 and 20. 'As the average number of hours worked is much higher for those personnel on overseas operations or at sea, the more time someone spends in these locations the greater the chance of breaching NMW thresholds.’ Crucial tool: An Apache helicopter on a rescue mission in Afghanistan. Harry remains qualified as an Apache pilot. He would need only a brief refresher course before being sent back to Camp Bastion for a 12-week stint . An MoD spokesman said: ‘We have worked hard to ensure that the sacrifices and dedication of our personnel is recognised, which is why they have continued to receive pay rises and also qualify for other benefits including subsidised accommodation, generous non-contributory pensions and substantial periods of paid leave. 'It is therefore entirely misleading to suggest that personnel earn less than the minimum wage. On the Golden Hello payments, he added: ‘As is common practice among commercial organisations, we use financial retention incentives to ensure we retain essential skills and experience within the Armed Forces.’","Prince's helicopter regiment is embarking on final tour of Afghanistan .

Some of the biggest names in shopping – Asda, Morrisons and department store Selfridges – are backing a Parliamentary offensive to extend Sunday trading hours. The retailers and some MPs want to relax laws in England and Wales which prevent large stores opening for more than six hours on Sundays. Asda is one of the big players calling for changes to be implemented in the regulations governing opening times . Conservative MP Philip Davies, vice-chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Retail Group, said:  ‘I would like to scrap the Sunday trading restrictions altogether. The sky has not fallen in Scotland where there are no such rules. Philip Davies MP: 'The sky has not fallen in Scotland where there are no such rules' ‘We are living with a ridiculous anomaly. If people want to keep Sunday special that is fine, they can do so. It is about freedom of choice.’ Under the Sunday Trading Act 1994 shops of over 300,000 sq ft can only open for a maximum of six hours on a Sunday and not before 10am. But Mr Davies believes that with the growth of online shopping, the time is right for a change. He intends this week to table a series of amendments to the Deregulation Bill going through Parliament, with MPs being given a chance for a free vote before the summer. These will include options to abolish restrictions altogether, to allow extra hours for stores to open on Sundays, or to give local authorities the power to decide. An amendment allowing large garden centres to open for eight hours on Sundays is also expected. Two years ago, the Government suspended the Sunday trading laws during the Olympic Games and allowed stores to open for eight hours. Asda, Morrisons and Selfridges have now told Ministers they would like the extra opening hours to be permanent. Should shops be allowed to open for longer on Sundays? DIY store B&Q supports the principle but is not campaigning. However, the Home Retail Group – which includes Homebase, Argos and Habitat – Sainsbury’s and Waitrose are against any change. John Lewis, Next and Lidl had nothing to say on the issue when approached. The Keep Sunday Special Campaign said extended Sunday opening in 2012 was a flop. The Department for Business said there were no current plans for a relaxation of the regulations.","Top retailers are calling for regulations on Sunday opening hours to change .

"By . Mark Duell . His remains have come to symbolise the nation's million dead from the First World War. But exactly how the Unknown Warrior - who rests in Westminster Abbey - was chosen has remained something of a mystery since the unidentified body was brought home from France in 1920. Now, an astonishing document that explains how the body was selected has been revealed by the grandson of Army chaplain George Kendall, who helped organise the bringing home of the corpse. Famous: The Grave of the Unknown Warrior is pictured (left) after the Armistice Day service at Westminster Abbey on November 11, 2009, and (right) at the funeral procession in London in 1920 . Almost a century ago: The funeral of the Unknown Warrior in 1920. The gun carriage bearing the Unknown Warrior's coffin is halted beside the Cenotaph for the unveiling ceremony . Tim Kendall said: 'My grandfather selected six corpses without identification marks. He made sure all the coffins looked exactly the same and that there was no evidence of where the bodies came from.' The 46-year-old charity adviser told the Sunday People that when he found the story in a box left by his grandfather, he realised: ‘This is a very significant part of British history.’ George Kendall OBE typewrote a document about the selection process, which he did not want revealed until after his death, and it will feature tonight on the BBC programme Antiques Roadshow. According to the Sunday People, it says: ‘Six bodies were taken to the headquarters at St Pol, near Arras. Those who awaited the bodies did not know from where they had come. Over the years: The scene at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior after the silence with the Dean of Westminster conducting the service, in 1939 . Paying his respects: US President Barack Obama lays a wreath at the tomb of the Unknown Warrior in 2011 . ‘The six coffins were placed in a hut and each was covered with a Union Jack. All night they rested on trestles, with nothing to distinguish one from the other. The Unknown Warrior's body was brought from France and buried on November 11, 1920. The idea is believed to have come from Reverend David Railton, who had been a chaplain on the Western Front. Some 1.2million people visited the Abbey during the week after the burial, and the site is one of the world’s most visited war graves. In 2011, the Duchess of Cambridge followed the poignant royal tradition of having her wedding bouquet left at the grave. The late Queen Mother began this when her posy was left at the grave in 1923 after her wedding to the Duke of York, later George VI. She laid the bouquet in tribute to her older brother Fergus Bowes-Lyon who was killed at the Battle of Loos in 1915 aged 26. His burial place was only found after her death in 2002. The biblical text on the tomb is taken from 2 Chronicles 24:16, which says: 'They buried him among the kings, because he had done good toward God and toward his house'. 'The door of the hut was locked and sentries posted outside. 'In the morning a general entered the hut, placed his hand on one of the flag-shrouded coffins and the body therein became the Unknown Warrior.’ Another chaplain, Reverend David Railton, is said to have got the idea for the Unknown Warrior after noticing a grave in France in 1916 with a cross and the words ‘An Unknown British Soldier’. Four years later in 1920 he wrote to the Dean of Westminster, Herbert Ryle, with his idea, and the body was chosen from servicemen exhumed from four battle areas - Arras, Ypres, the Aisne and the Somme. It is said that Brigadier General L.J. Wyatt chose the body at random, before the other bodies were reburied. Confirmed accounts state there were only four bodies, according to Westminster Abbey's website, but George Kendall’s claim of there being six puts that figure in some doubt.

"By . Mark Nicol . Senior Army officers, including generals, will be court-martialled and jailed if they send troops into battle with inadequate equipment, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Rules introduced last week mean that – for the first time in Army  history – commanders will be held legally responsible for deaths in a war zone caused by faulty kit. Last night, as troops’ families  welcomed the move, top brass warned that combat operations could grind to a halt as officers fear being singled out for blame. New rules: Royal Marines from Fire Support Troop, Charlie Company, 40 Commando, fire a Javelin missile as they attack a Taliban position on the frontline near Kajaki in Afghanistan's Helmand province . The Duty Holder Concept (DHC) regulations will cover all remaining British military operations in Afghanistan, which are scheduled to end in December, and any future conflicts involving UK Forces. Their introduction follows huge public outcry over the hundreds of deaths linked to the use of shoddy equipment in Iraq and Afghanistan, including faulty radios and vehicles lacking armoured protection. The move also comes after the  UK Supreme Court ruled that the Government owes a duty of care to soldiers and that their families can sue the Ministry of Defence if equipment failures lead to deaths. Under DHC, senior officers will face charges if safety warnings are ignored – without an operational imperative to do so. The rules may also cover high-tech pieces of equipment, such as computers intended to protect helicopters from surface-to-air missiles, or if officers are found to have dismissed concerns raised by an armoured vehicle crew that – due to a mechanical fault – it was likely to tip over, trapping personnel inside. The rules are being introduced to prevent senior officers escaping justice if they are considered to be responsible for soldiers’ deaths. New era of accountability: Rules introduced last week mean that - for the first time in Army  history - commanders will be held legally responsible for deaths in a war zone caused by faulty kit . It follows a review into the 2006 RAF Nimrod spy plane crash, in which 14 UK personnel were killed after a leaking fuel pipe caused  a huge mid-air explosion over  Afghanistan. A Government-backed inquiry subsequently criticised two RAF officers for failing to highlight the risks caused by a refit of the aircraft’s engines and fuselage. The investigation, led by Charles Haddon-Cave QC, accused Air Commodore George Baber of a ‘fundamental failure of leadership’ and singled out Wing Commander Michael Eagles for allegedly ‘failing to make safety his first priority’. However, despite a probe by military police, neither man was brought before a court martial – a decision met with fury by the victims’ families. The relatives served a writ accusing the MoD of negligence, failing to minimise risk and a breach of the right to life. The MoD settled out of court. Last night, Graham Knight, 62, whose 25-year-old son Ben was killed in the crash, said: ‘This is  a good idea because it should be absolutely clear at every level of the chain of command who is responsible for addressing safety concerns and ensuring that risk is reduced to the lowest level, within the context of an operation. ‘In corporate life you can be held accountable, and I think that a system like this is long overdue across the Services. ‘We should also bear in mind, however, that this is coming into practice as our troops are coming home from Afghanistan. The system isn’t going to be backdated. ‘In the case of my son’s death, we needed a system like this eight years ago. Back then it was easier for officers to swerve accountability. ‘The Nimrod was unsafe to fly due to the design modifications. These issues should have been highlighted as part of the safety review.’ The new rules come after an probe by Charles Haddon-Cave QC singled out RAF officers for failing to highlight risks before a 2006 RAF Nimrod spy plane crash. Colonel Richard Kemp warned it would 'burden' commanders . But Colonel Richard Kemp, a former commander of British Forces, warned that the DHC system would plague battlefield operations and hang officers out to dry. ‘Commanders making life or death decisions in combat are already under more pressure than most human beings could bear,’ he said. ‘They should not be subjected to increasing burdens of this sort which can only make their jobs harder and put lives at risk. ‘If every battlefield decision  which results in loss of life is potentially dissected in the court room then commanders’ jobs will become impossible. And there will also be an effect on recruiting. How many people want to sign up to become scapegoats when things go wrong?’ Last night, a spokesman for the MoD said: ‘Defence is inherently a dangerous business and we are very clear that battlefield commanders must always be able to take calculated risks to achieve operational and mission success. ‘The MoD is like any other large organisation with a responsibility to its personnel and employees. We want to actively reduce preventable risks to life and injury, which is why procedures are in place covering military activity or the operation  of military equipment wherever that takes place.’ An RAF Nimrod MR2 spy plane, like the one which crashed in Afghanistan in 2006, killing 14 British servicemen. A report ruled that officers had failed to assess the risks and that 'key dangers' went unnoticed . The historic ruling has come about as a result of the Nimrod air crash, which cost the lives of 14 personnel on a secret mission to intercept Taliban radio transmissions in Afghanistan. Defence sources say that, had the Duty Holder Concept (DHC) been in place then, senior officers allegedly to blame for the tragedy would have been brought before  a court martial. The 2006 crash – caused when leaking fuel made contact with  a hot air pipe after air-to-air refuelling – saw the plane break up in mid-air as the crew tried to make it back to Kandahar Airport. There were no survivors. The tragedy was the biggest single loss of life suffered by British Forces since the Falklands. A report later ruled that senior officers had failed to assess the risks . posed by the lay-out of pipes . inside the Nimrod, that ‘key dangers’ had gone unnoticed and that the . Ministry of Defence’s internal safety review, conducted before the tragedy happened was 'lamentable' Grieving relatives were also told that senior officers . refused to answer questions put by military police and could not be . held to account due to their seniority. The DHC, introduced by the . Army last week, would come into effect in scenarios such as commanders . ignoring safety warnings set down for the use of the powerful Javelin . missile. In Afghanistan the heat-seeking rocket has been known to . veer off course, endangering troops. Safety experts have tightened the guidelines over its use.","Duty Holder Concept rules now cover all conflicts involving British forces .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A ‘tortured’ corpse washed up on a beach in Spain has been identified as that of missing Briton Francis Brennan. The body of Liverpudlian Francis Brennan who went on the run rather than going to prison for stabbing someone has been found on a Spanish beach . Brennan, 25, from Anfield, Liverpool, was last seen in the Costa del Sol town of Javea on January 24 when he was taken away in handcuffs by men posing as Guardia Civil police. His remains were found last weekend wrapped in a bin bag and duct tape washed up on Orihuela Costa beach in Alicante. It was formally identified by Spanish authorities yesterday. They said the man's hands were tied and that he had a severe head wound while his body was said to be in an ‘advanced state of decomposition’. A waiter who found the body told Spanish newspaper El Mundo: ‘As it was covered we did not know if it was an animal or a person, so we called the police.’ Police believe he may have been tortured and killed. Officers said that the dead man had been in the water for several days, and he was about 10 metres from the water when he was found. Reports from Spain suggested a concrete block had been placed inside the sack to make the body sink, but that this had been dislodged. Brennan fled the UK last October before he could be sent to jail for stabbing someone at a Swedish House Mafia concert in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, in July last year. Two months later, Sophie Staunton, his girlfriend, travelled to Javea, Alicante, to persuade him to come home. He refused and went missing a month later as he left a gym with a friend. When he was 18, Brennan was was convicted of affray after a gang of youths caused trouble outside the Liverpool home of grandfather Jim Barrett who died of a heart attack. Brennan was sent to a young offenders' institute but returned to a life of crime when he lost his job at 21. Scroll down for video . Francis Brennan's remains were found last weekend wrapped in a bin bag and duct tape washed up here on Orihuela Costa beach in Alicante . In February his parents, Carl and Janet, made an appeal for any information and talked about him absconding. 'Running away was a very, very silly decision,' said his mother. 'We tried to to talk him out of it but Francis is very headstrong. He wouldn't listen to us. 'His life was coming together and he didn't want to lose that. He knew he was going to get a bit of time and he wasn't quite ready to do that. You can only advise people so much.' Karl and Janet Brennan, the parents of Francis Brennan, 25, from Liverpool, who went missing while living in Alicante. His dead body was washed ashore in Spain last weekend . A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: ‘We can confirm that a body found on a beach in the La Zenia area of Alicante on Saturday was last night formally identified by the Spanish authorities as Francis Brennan. ‘His parents have been informed of his death and a family liaison officer from Merseyside Police is providing them with support and advice at this difficult time. ‘A live police investigation carried out by the authorities in Spain remains ongoing.’","Francis Brennan, 25, fled the UK after stabbing a man at a pop concert .

"By . Luke Garratt . A couple were left shocked when workmen accidentally threw away their bespoke 'kitchen for life' worth almost £10,000 - and binmen mistook it for rubbish. Julie Martin, 51, and partner Kevin McKeith, 53, were having some new electrical wire installed in their house in South Shields, Newcastle, when they realised their kitchen fittings had been taken away to the tip, leaving their expensive kitchen a gutted husk. The contractors had taken down all of the kitchen units, cupboards and surfaces in order to fit the wiring in the walls, and placed them at the back of the house - only for binmen to take them away. Julie Martin, 52, in the husk of her now-gutted kitchen after workmen inadvertently threw the £9,500 fittings out . The mistake cost the couple £9,500, and now they are left searching for a new kitchen. Ms Martin and Mr McKeith were in the midst of having their kitchen repaired by contractors who were working on behalf of South Tyneside Homes, who were carrying out the work as a part of their 'Decent Homes' programme. Because the couple loved their bespoke kitchen, they declined the offer of a new one, but still needed some rewiring and a new bathroom. Ms Martin, said: 'We got our own kitchen put in about five years ago and we spent £9,500 on it. 'I . love cooking and baking so I spend a lot of time in, and we wanted . something that was going to last - that was meant to be our kitchen for . life. 'They have accepted blame, but what I don't understand is if they put the cupboards outside, they . must have known they had to bring them back in when they were done, and . if the cupboards were missing then why didn't they say anything? The workmen had left the fittings outside next to the bins while they had carried out the electrical wire renovations, where the binmen mistook the expensive cabinets for rubbish . Julie Martin was having renovations to her South Shields house as a part of the Decent Homes programme - but had declined a kitchen renovation because she was happy with her £9,500 kitchen . 'We told the council that we didn't want a new kitchen off them and were happy to keep the one we had. 'The workers needed to take the top cupboards off the walls to do the re-wiring. 'The story is that to make more room for themselves, they put the cupboards out in the back yard then a binman, who was going around collecting rubbish, came and took them away. 'It wasn't until the next day that I started sorting through boxes and things in the kitchen and noticed they weren't anywhere in the house.' Julie, a support worker for people with brain injuries, said she contacted housing bosses, who held their hands up and admitted fault straight away. Ms Martin has been offered a new kitchen by the housing authority, which has admitted they were in error, but she feels she hasn't been offered one of the same standard . The couple have been told they can choose a replacement kitchen as means of compensation, but they say they have yet to be offered one they feel is of the same quality or value to the units they lost. A spokesman for South Tyneside Homes said: 'This was a genuine mistake on behalf of the contractor, which has accepted responsibility and apologised for the error. 'The contractor has assured us they are working very hard to resolve the issue and have offered the tenant a range of options to try to progress this as quickly as possible.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Joshua Gardner . The animal believed by some to be the legendary 'goat sucker' beast el chupacabra was likely a diseased raccoon, but no necropsy will be performed to confirm. The hairless, snarling creature was discovered Sunday by a Texas couple eating corn outside their Ratcliffe home, they since have had it euthanized because it appeared to be suffering. A local game official told TMZ he believes it was a raccoon with mange, but that no necropsy will be performed on the bizarre creature. Scroll down for video . Is this El Chupacabra? A Texas couple found this mysterious creature in their yard on Sunday and believe it is a legendary chupacabra . 'He called me to come and look, and I said ""Bubba that looks like a baby chupacabra,¿' said Jackie Stock after her husband first happened on the creature . 'The warden did contact the person who trapped the animal and told him that since it did appear to be a raccoon, he would have to release it back into the wild or euthanize it,' Mike Cox, Texas parks and Wildlife Department spokesperson, told NBC News. 'The land owner left a message on the warden's voice mail this morning that the animal had been euthanized.' When asked by NBC why no further investigation would be done, Cox quipped 'our agency does not believe chupacabras exist anywhere but in the imaginations of some.' Some of those people include Jackie Stock and her husband, the couple who discovered the bizarre beast and began calling it Chupie. She told TMZ of her sadness at having it put down. 'It went to sleep peacefully,' she told TMZ. 'I had gotten attached.  I was calling him Chupie.  He will be missed.' 'We've never seen anything like it before': The couple has kept the animal around in order to show it around in hopes someone can ID it . Officials at the DeWitt County Sheriff's Office referred inquiries about the animal to local game warden Mike Hoffman, who has yet to respond to interview requests from MailOnline. The woman also told the gossip site that she had received several complaints over the unusual animal being kept in a cage and not receiving proper care. The couple was in disbelief after first discovering the creature, which she said is likely only a raccoon with mange. 'He called me to come and look, and I said 'Bubba that looks like a baby chupacabra,' Stock said. The animal was not very large, perhaps the size of a house cat. They kept it in a cage, fed it and made sure it had water. PETA began leaving her voice mail complaints over how they cared for the supposed chupacabra, according to reports. They also gave friends and neighbors the opportunity to come take a peek. Neighbor Arlen Parma spoke from experience, and insisted it was likely the blood-sucking chupacabra. 'I hunted coons for 20 years with dogs and I ain’t ever seen anything that looks like that right there,' Parma told KAVU. Jackie Stock shows where she first happened on the animal she thinks is a chupacabra . 'I hunted coons for 20 years with dogs and I ain’t ever seen anything that looks like that right there,' said the Stocks' neighbor Arlen Parma . And his identification wasn't just based on looks: . 'A coon doesn’t make that noise, or a possum. What makes that noise? I guess a chupacabra does,' Parma said. Stock and her husband say they kept the animal in a cage, not to harm it, but out of curiosity. 'We were just trying to figure out what it is because we've never seen anything like it before,' Stock said. No chupacabra has ever been positively identified, of course, and if the Stock's find is ever ID'd, it will likely be as a mammal, possibly with a parasitic infestation that has caused its hair to fall out. The Stocks are feeding the animal and making sure it has plenty of water . Mangy? Many believe chupacabra sightings are nothing more than mammals like foxes or raccoons with hair loss caused by mange . LEGEND OF EL CHUPACABRA . The word comes from two Spanish words - 'chupar', to suck, and 'cabra', goat. The first reported sighting was In 1995, when eight sheep were found dead in Puerto Rico with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood. Thus, the legend of the livestock killing, vampire-like chupacabra was born. Since then, the legendary beast has been spotted across the Americas and even the world. A Mexican incident where 35 sheep were found mysteriously dead was blamed on El Chupacabra in 2012. Earlier this year, yet another Mississippi sighting came when a Leake County man actually shot and killed what he claimed was El Chupacabra. Even a Belarusian town had a Chupacabra sighting this past July . SCIENCE ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN . Scientists often speculate that hairless creatures believed to be El Chupacabra are actually wildlife like coyotes, foxes, and stray dogs infested with parasites. Most commonly pointed to is the parasite Sarcoptes scabiei, which causes mange. Mange is a painful, potentially life threatening condition which can cause complete hair loss in mammals and can also cause their skin to shrivel, making for an even more ghoulish looking beast. In humans, Sarcoptes scabiei causes scabies and a consequent itchy, painful rash as the parasites burrow around, leaving their feces under the skin.

Military chiefs have also held top-level meetings with National Health Service executives in an attempt to get more medical staff to join the part-time force. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond wants to double the number of reservists while axing full-time troops. Under controversial plans outlined in the 2010 defence review, the size of the regular Army is being slashed from 102,000 to 82,000 while doubling the reserve from 15,000 to 30,000. Thousands of troops have been laid off. It has been billed as the biggest change to the military reservists since the Second World War. But Mr Hammond is facing growing criticism that the plans are badly thought through amid concerns commanders will fail to meet the deadline to hit manning targets. Embarrassingly, the number of Army reservists actually fell by 50 – to 19,150 – in the year to January, according to the latest Ministry of Defence personnel figures. The recruitment crisis has been exacerbated by a bungled IT project to handle paperwork at recruiting offices. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond wants to double the number of reservists while axing full-time troops . Now Major General Ranald Munro, the head of the Territorial Army, is under growing pressure to hit targets. The £10,000 – up from £5,000 - will be paid over three years. The scheme, for troops up to the rank of Captain, started this week. So far this financial year, 790 full-time soldiers have transferred to the Army Reserve. Attracting more regular soldiers into the part-time force saves money because a former full-time soldier does not need basic training. Civilians who join with no experience will get £300. The money will cover the cost of petrol for driving to recruitment centres and help to maintain an applicant’s interest while waiting for medical and other pre-training checks to be completed. In what is seen as a crisis move, top brass have met with NHS chiefs to try to free up more health staff to sign up to the reserves. But health chiefs say the NHS - which already provides 2,000 people to the Army Reserve - cannot release staff unless the Government pays for more costly agency nurses and doctors to replace those on military duty. As part of the MoD’s ‘Reserves In The Future’ plan, 29 per cent of the Army will be made up of part-time soldiers. They will be responsible for delivering capabilities including linguists, computer technicians and cyber-warfare teams. They will also be required to bolster infantry battalions, providing specialist medical skills such neurosurgeons and anaesthetists. But senior officers are concerned that young men and women no longer see the Army Reserve as an attractive option. He said: ‘We have tried everything and it is not working. People simply are not interested and we are now in a situation in which we are desperate to pull people into uniform to meet the manning targets. ‘We have lots and lots of officers but not enough soldiers. The situation is very bad.’ Under the shake-up, Mr Hammond has vowed to spend £1.8billion ensuring the reserves have better equipment, new uniforms and are more professional by making them train overseas and alongside regular troops. Overhauling the image of the TA by rebranding it the ‘Army Reserve’ is an attempt to help shed its ‘Dad’s Army’ reputation. Reservists would be expected to take on more front line duties, but critics fear the changes will undermine Britain’s military prowess on the world stage. Mr Hammond said recently he wanted to develop a culture where regular soldiers often wanted to become reservists after leaving full-time service. He said: ‘Ex-regulars deliver a robustness because most of them will be experienced. Many of them will have seen combat operations. They give a backbone to the Reserve.’ An Army spokesperson said: 'Having already had over 1,400 ex-regulars join the Army Reserve over the last two years, we want to build on this by recognising their immense value and unique professional contribution by doubling the financial incentive for ex-regulars joining the Army Reserve. 'Ex-regulars bring exceptional practical and operational experience to the Reserves. We are reforming and revitalising our Reserve Forces, investing £1.8bn in better training and equipment and fully integrating them with the rest of the Army.'","£300 will be paid to any civilian who wants to enlist in the Army Reserve .

"By . James Mulholland . A young couple who violently attempted to extort money from an amateur glamour photographer have been jailed for a total of nine years. Garry Faulds, 21, and his fiancée Laura Colquhoun, 17, hatched a plot to force their middle-aged victim to give them hundreds of pounds or they would expose his allegedly sleazy lifestyle. The High Court in Edinburgh heard how the man, who is in his 50s and cannot be named for legal reasons, took photographs of aspiring model Colquhoun at his home over the course of a year. Garry Faulds and his girlfriend Laura Colquhoun, who were sentenced for a total of nine years for extorting a man in his 50s . It was claimed that she had repeatedly performed a sex act on him and was receiving £150 per photo session. But just before one sitting, the teenager allowed her boyfriend – dressed in a balaclava and boiler suit – to enter the local government employee’s Edinburgh house. Once inside, Faulds bound the man’s arms, legs and mouth with tape before threatening him with a gas canister, repeatedly striking him and threatening him by claiming to be a member of an Ulster loyalist terror group who could do him serious harm. Faulds also said he would tell the man’s employer that he was taking illegal photographs of underage girls. The pair had plotted to force their middle-aged victim to give them hundreds of pounds or they would expose his allegedly sleazy lifestyle . Garry Faulds scared his middle aged captor by tying him up, beating him and claiming to be a member of an Ulster loyalist terror group who could cause him serious harm . Yesterday, temporary judge Paul . Arthurson, QC, sentenced Faulds to six years in prison. His girlfriend . wept as she was handed three years’ detention. Judge Arthurson said: ‘Given the extremely serious nature of the offence, which must have been truly terrifying for the complainer who was in own home, custodial sentences are inevitable.’ Laura Colquhoun at Edinburgh High Court where she was sentenced to three years in jail . Last month, Faulds and Colquhoun, of Paisley, Renfrewshire, were convicted of robbing, assaulting and threatening to extort cash from the man on August 23 last year. Sentence was deferred until yesterday for reports. The man, who works in a senior capacity for a local authority, has never been charged or prosecuted in connection with the allegations made by Faulds. During the trial, the victim told how he had met Colquhoun in 2012 and had conducted a number of photo shoots with her. Recalling the day of the attack, he said: ‘When I walked into the hall, there was a guy dressed in a balaclava with the eyes cut out. He was wearing a blue jump suit. 'He came towards me and he tried to overpower me. I fell backwards. I was screaming “help”. 'I was shouting as loudly as I could. ‘He sat there for a period of time presumably just to frighten me and I must say it was quite effective.’ The court heard that the intruder tried to access the photographer’s online bank account but failed. The couple stole £800 and tried to extort another £500 from him. Yesterday, Faulds’s advocate John McElroy said: ‘Mr Faulds regrets his actions. To paraphrase the words to a popular pop song, if he could turn back time, he would.’ Colquhoun’s solicitor advocate Liam O’Donnell said: ‘Social workers describe her as somebody who is naive. 'She made a seriously poor decision. She was very much the minor actor in the flat. 'The report describes her as being a vulnerable young woman who is keen to do well but is easily led.’","Garry Faulds, 21, and Laura Colquhoun, 17, from Edinburgh jailed .

"By . Richard Spillett . A murderer who has spent nearly half a century behind bars and is now free thinks people living in modern Britain aren't as nice as used to be. Alan Houchin, 75, was jailed for life for strangling teenage waitress Shona Berry in 1965 and was sent back to prison in 1979 for raping a 19-year-old shop assistant while out on licence. But after emerging from one of the longest prison stretches in British history, he says the country has changed for the worse since he was first locked up. Free man: Alan Houchin, who was released after nearly half a century in jail, says people are not as nice as they used to be and that people lack respect for each other . Alan Houchin visiting a graveyard in Swanley, Kent, where he is living with former partner Mary Griggs . He told The Sun: 'The biggest change I've found since I've been in jail is in people. Everyone is me, me, me. 'There are no manners anymore. People are so rude, they bang into and push past you. The sense of community has gone.' The killer, who admits the murder but has always denied the rape, told the paper he opened to door for a woman at the supermarket after his release, but she was offended and said she could do it for herself. He claimed today's Britain is all about 'instant gratification' and people have lost respect for each other. Asked whether he felt lost in the modern world, he insisted he had kept up with developments on the outside and was fine. Houchin has spent 46 of the last 49 . years behind bars and was released last month from Leyhill open prison in Gloucestershire. He is now planning to . get married to his former partner Mary Griggs, 54. Alan Houchin, following his escape from custody in 1993, and the Daily . Mail's headline from a report of the murder of Shona Berry in 1965 . A Daily Mail report of the hunt for Houchin, who escaped from guards when he visited his dying father in 1993 . Houchin spent the last part of his marathon stretch at Leyhill open prison in Gloucestershire . The . couple are now living in a council house in Swanley, Kent, . but local residents have said they do not want him in the area. Neighbours say Houchin has been a . regular visitor to the house over the last couple of years as he was . allowed out of prison on day release. One said: 'He's always out there . tinkering with his car. Mary told me he used to be in prison and she . used to go and visit him and he would come and see her on day release . too. 'Of course I've heard rumours about what he did. I've heard he killed a young girl and raped another girl. 'I've never asked him about it though - you just wouldn't. Mary keeps to herself, most of the time, which is something we all do around here. 'If he is a convicted murderer and rapist I definitely don't want him living round here.' Houchin's . victim Shona Berry was found dead in a park in the seaside resort of . Margate in August 1965 after staying in the town with friends. A photo of Houchin released by police after he went on the run in 1993 . Houchin narrowly avoided a death sentence for the murder, because he was sentenced just seven days after capital punishment was abolished. Following his release from his first prison stretch on licence, his life sentence was reimposed in 1979 for the rape. His sentence was increased after he went on the run . in 1993, when he escaped from guards while visiting his sickly father in a south London hospice. Houchin convinced officers to leave him alone and remove his handcuffs so he could have one last 'intimate moment' with his father, before disappearing. During his two weeks at large police warned Houchin was 'charming but dangerous' and 'should not be approached'. On his recapture he was sent to Belmarsh Prison, where he was beaten by three prisoners with a battery in a sock after they discovered he was a sex offender. In April 2006, he was transferred to open conditions at HMP North Sea Camp in Lincolnshire after the risk he posed to the public was assessed as 'medium'. In 2010 he won a controversial High Court battle to be switched to a more comfortable prison with less security. But a senior officer later decided he remained 'high risk' and he was moved back to a more secure jail. Houchin then sought damages from Lincolnshire probation service, claiming he became 'stressed and anxious' after being taken back into stricter conditions. He claimed his liberty was restricted, he was forced to share a cell with a smoker and lost his appetite. He spent the last part of his marathon stretch at Leyhill open prison in Gloucestershire and was finally released on licence in March. Victim's . charity Support After Murder and Manslaughter have expressed concerns that he may still . be dangerous because of his history of crime. Chief Executive Rose Dixon said: 'I cannot believe they are letting this guy out with the history of violence he has. 'I understand prison staff had concerns about him in the past and I cannot understand why he has been released.' Among Britain's longest-serving prisoners are Moors murderer Ian Brady, 76, who is still serving the three life sentences he was given in 1966, and Harry Roberts, 77, who was also locked up in 1966 for the murder of three policemen in London.","Alan Houchin was locked up for killing one teenager and raping another .

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . Councils are to get new powers to stop betting shops blighting high streets. Measures being drawn up by ministers will mean local authorities effectively being able to cap the number of bookmakers opening up, according to well-placed sources. The reforms are expected to be unveiled before Easter following mounting pressure on the Government to curb the explosion of shops containing high stakes gambling machines. Measures being drawn up by ministers will mean local authorities effectively being able to cap the number of bookmakers opening up, according to well-placed sources . The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents more than 370 councils in England and Wales, has called for sweeping changes to the licensing system to limit the growth of betting premises. Ralph Topping, chief executive of William Hill, has also backed calls for councils to be handed greater powers to block new betting shops where there are existing clusters. Changes to planning rules last year made it easier for bookmakers to convert empty shops on the high street without needing permission. Over the last decade, the number of betting shops in some areas has doubled. Campaigners against fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs), dubbed the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling, accused firms of opening more shops to get round limits on the number of machines in each. William Hill's chief executive Ralph Topping said that he backed calls for councils to be handed greater powers to block new betting shops where there are existing clusters . Critics of the machines, which allow people to wager up to £100 a spin every 20 seconds, say they are highly addictive and have made casino-style gambling accessible on the high street. Britain’s 33,000 FOBTs, also dubbed the . ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling, have been under increasing scrutiny in . recent months. The terminals are increasingly key to the bookmaking . industry, now raking in more than £1bn a year in profit. In January, David Cameron . admitted that there is a ‘problem’ that needs to be addressed and . offered to work with Labour to tackle the rising number of betting shops . and fixed-odds betting machines. Labour has suggested putting . betting shops in a separate use class so that councils can use planning . powers to control the number opening in their area. Another proposal being considered . is to allow councils to consider the ‘cumulative’ impact when making . licensing decisions which would force betting companies to prove that . new shops would not have a negative effect on the local economy or . existing businesses.Tony Page, the LGA’s licensing . spokesman, said: ‘Councils aren’t anti-bookies but need powers to tackle . the damage that can be caused to high streets and town centres by the . clustering of betting shops. ‘Planning and licensing controls are supposed to ensure new shops or business will benefit an area but the current system is preventing councils from acting on community concerns. The result is many of our high streets becoming saturated with betting shops and councils left powerless to act to limit the number opening up in their area. ‘Licensing laws must be updated to allow councils to consider the impact a new betting shop would have on their local economy and existing businesses. This would protect the power of local communities and democratically-elected councillors to shape their area.’ A Government source said: ‘We have said that we will look again at the issue of betting shops and fixed odds betting terminals. For now, we would urge local authorities to use the range of powers and tools they already have under gambling and planning legislation where particular problems arise.’ Campaigners against fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs), dubbed the 'crack cocaine' of gambling, accused firms of opening more shops to get round limits on the number of machines in each .","Measures will mean local authorities can cap number of bookmakers opening .

"By . Wills Robinson . A little girl who would tell her soldier father jokes to try and cheer him up in Afghanistan has published a book of the one-liners they shared. Seven-year-old Grace Franklin from Billingham, County Durham, would speak to her Army officer father, Glen, on the phone or via Skype every day of his six-month tour in Helmand Province. Each time they would tell each other jokes, and after coming up with so many, Grace decided to sell the collection to raise money for the Royal British Legion. Comedian: Grace Franklin, seven, from Billingham in County Durham has published the jokes she shared with her father while he was on a tour of duty in Helmand Province, Afghanistan . Father and daughter: Grace and Glen, 44, would speak every day via Skype or on the phone and would share the one-liners each time . Grace and her father, who serves in the Royal Engineers, have raised £630 so far and the fundraiser has been awarded a special Young Person’s Award by the mayor of Billingham. Grace explained that her mother, Jenny, and big sister, Elizabeth, would tell her jokes when her father was away that she would repeat on the phone. Jenifer said: 'It was her idea to write the book which took more than six months and sold over 600 copies. 'I really hope my book helps anybody who is feeling a bit sad.' The book is being sold to raise money for the Royal British Legion. Grace has already received £630 and hopes to sell thousands more copies. Q: Why did the picture go to jail?A: Because it was framed. Q. Why did the traffic light turn red?A. You would too if you had to change in the middle of the street! Q. What did one elevator say to the other elevator?A. I think I’m coming down with something! Q. What did the stamp say to the envelope?A. Stick with me and we will go places! Q. Why did the banana go to the Doctor?A. Because it was not peeling well. And her favourite joke? ‘What do you get if a giant monster sat on Batman and Robin? A flatman and ribbon!' 'When she said she would like to help other children with mums and dads in the forces. The joke book seemed the best way.' Her mother, Jenny, a community fundraiser, said special mention should go to Grace’s school and all its parents and children who bought and sold many of the books. A second book is already being planned. 'Grace worked very hard for a long time to make that book,' she said. Her big sister, Elizabeth, 16, said: 'I’m so proud to have Grace as my little sister.

"By . Sami Mokbel . Sportsmail understands Manchester City's director of football Txiki Begiristain was in Porto on Thursday to watch French centre half Eliaquim Mangala in action. Read the full story on the £20m-rated centre back HERE . Manchester City want to buy British this  summer as they struggle to keep hold of their homegrown stars. The club are identifying summer targets to satisfy Premier League rules on homegrown players, with Southampton full back Luke Shaw, Everton midfielder Ross Barkley and Nottingham Forest defender Jamaal Lascelles in their sights. City nominated nine homegrown players in their squad at the start of the season but face losing several of them this summer. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez on Ross Barkley's ability . Midfielder: Ross Barkley . Full-back: Luke Shaw . Defender: Jamaal Lascelles . Wonderkid: Ross Barkley (L) has been earning rave reviews for Everton, including this goal against Newcastle . Luke who's talking: Southampton defender Shaw has also been linked with Manchester United and Chelsea . Best defence: Nottingham Forest's Jamaal Lascelles could be needed to replace departing homegrown players . And, although the 2012 Premier League . champions are closing in on £20m-rated Porto centre back Eliaquim . Mangala, don't expect too many more exports in the summer. Central defender Joleon Lescott will leave when his contract expires. Likewise, Micah Richards is not prepared to sign a new, five-year deal. Richards has struggled for games under Manuel Pellegrini, yet the club are keen to keep him and Sportsmail understands the right back has been offered an increase on his £80,000-a-week deal to stay. Feeling unwanted: City defender Joleon Lescott (R) is expected to leave at the end of the season . Not about the money: Micah Richards has been offered an increase to stay but wants more playing time . What shall we do? Youngsters Jack Rodwell and Deryck Boyota are also considering their futures . Premier League clubs must include no more than 17 non-homegrown players over the age of 21 in their squads of 25. Homegrown players are defined as players trained by their club, or another in the same country, for at least three years between 15 and 21. There is no obligation to put a certain number of them in a match-day squad.Why were the rules brought in?There was concern that the richest clubs would stockpile the best players to the detriment of developing their own youngsters. The 25-year-old’s contract does not expire until the end of next  season, but City may look to sell him in a cut-price deal this summer to avoid losing him for nothing in 2015. Liverpool, Arsenal and AC Milan are monitoring the situation. Dedryck Boyata, who qualifies as homegrown even though he is  Belgian, has also been offered a new deal despite playing only one  league game this season. However, the defender is understood to be hugely reluctant to  re-sign given his lack of playing time and is also likely to leave.  City chiefs will open talks with James Milner — whose contract expires next season — before the World Cup, but the England  forward wants assurances over his playing time before agreeing to an extension. Play me! James Milner wants assurances before he commits to a new contract at the Etihad . Stunted growth: Rodwell has struggled to displace stars like Vincent Kompany since moving from Everton . Pecking order: Alex Nimely may be tempted to move with the likes of Sergio Aguero ahead of him . The future of striker Alex Nimely, 22, is also unclear given that his contract expires this summer, while Jack Rodwell is known to be considering his future at the Etihad Stadium. Midfielder Gareth Barry, on loan at Everton, will definitely be leaving while Serbia defender Matija  Nastasic will be counted as an overseas player next season, having turned 21 last month. Behind the scenes, the potential lack of homegrown talent is a  concern and buying British is likely to be a necessity for City. Sporting director Txiki Begiristain is well aware of the problem and City’s network of scouts are  working hard to identify targets. One of ours: Matija Nastasic will be considered a homegrown player next season having turned 21 last month . Sticking with Toffees? Gareth Barry is certain to leave after spending the season on loan with Everton . Warning signs! Scott Sinclair (L) was offloaded after barely featuring during his short spell at City . However, persuading the likes of Shaw, 18, Barkley, 20, and Lascelles, 20, that they can fulfil their  footballing potential at City might prove a further stumbling block. You only need look at how some City buys have fared to understand why they might be cautious. Scott Sinclair and Rodwell arrived from Swansea and Everton respectively in 2012 but have struggled to make an impact. Sinclair has been shipped out on loan to West Bromwich Albion while Rodwell has found first-team  football hard to come by, partly due to injury, and has made only seven Premier League starts. Head to head: Jose Mourinho (L) and Manuel Pellegrini could be competing for the same players next season . Old guard: John Terry (top), Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole (R) are some of Chelsea's hew homegrown stars . Chelsea are also keeping abreast of the homegrown market. Manager Jose Mourinho could name only a 22-man squad in September after reaching his full quota of 17 overseas players. At the time, John Terry, Gary Cahill, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard and Ryan Bertrand were the only homegrown players at his disposal — meaning he had to forego three squad places. Chelsea, like City, will be in the market for all the best English talent this summer, including Shaw and Barkley. And that means only one thing: sky-high prices.","Manchester City are targetting young English players for next season .

"By . Sophie Freeman . There can be few things more annoying for the keen gardener than greenflies munching away on your prized roses. But for those not keen on using chemical pesticides, one gardening expert has come up with a solution – delivering live ladybirds to your door. Sarah Raven, a guest presenter on Gardener’s World, has started selling the insects through her website, sarahraven.com . Tackling the problem: A ladybird feeds on greenfly, pests which feed at plants . The ladybirds are put into tubes where they live happily on a diet of popcorn or cereal while being delivered by first class post. Mrs Raven said: ‘Ladybirds are brilliant in the garden because they feed off green and black fly, as well as other insect pests who would otherwise be munching on your home-grown flowers and produce. ‘They are a chemical-free alternative to pesticides, so are great for the organic gardener. ‘They will get rid of pests without affecting your crops or being harmful to other wildlife. ‘They are sent by first class post in their own little box which contains a packed lunch of popcorn or cereal to keep them happy. Transport: The ladybirds are put into tubes where they live happily on a diet of popcorn or cereal while being delivered by first class post . ‘On the day that they arrive they should be stored somewhere cool until the late evening when they can be released out into the garden.’ Once established, they should start breeding – and help solve your greenfly problems for years to come. Mrs Raven, who runs a gardening school at her farm in Sussex, said: ‘Releasing ladybirds should lead to a permanent decrease in the number of pests in your garden – each ladybird will eat about 500 aphids (greenfly) and will soon produce ladybird larvae which in turn also eat aphids.’ The ladybirds will be available from May until August.","The insects are put in tubes, delivered first class and feed on popcorn .

"By . Wills Robinson . Conduct: Dr Peter Rubin is facing being struck off after he was found guilty of sexual misconduct by a Medical Practitioners Tribunal in Manchester . A GP who had sex with a mother-of-two in his surgery faces being struck off after he was found guilty of sexually-motivated conduct when he asked a female student to kiss him. Married Dr Peter Rubin, 53, bought gifts for the woman in her 40s, bombarded her with personal texts and made inappropriate comments in a ‘long campaign to woo her’, a tribunal heard. The pair had sex at the Woodlands Medical Centre, in Didcot, Oxfordshire on Christmas Eve 2007 before Dr Rubin prescribed the morning after pill and said: ‘You had better take this or it will be just my luck you will be standing in an antenatal clinic’. The affair cooled off in 2008, but the woman, known only as Patient A, reported the shamed family doctor to the General Medical Council when he tried to ‘forcibly remove her trousers’ during a consultation four years later. Dr Rubin is accused of misconduct at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, where he faces being struck off. He also admitted that he joked ‘come back in or your boyfriend will have to have lots of cold showers’ when a 21-year-old student, referred to as Patient B, asked for the contraceptive pill. The GP then asked her to kiss him on the cheek in a ‘spur of the moment’ light hearted gesture, which he claimed was not sexually motivated. The girl’s ‘horrified’ mother reported him to the surgery in July 2011 and ‘devastated’ Dr Rubin was forced to apologise. German-born Dr Rubin blamed the incident on his ‘foreign sense of humour’, but the fitness to practise panel, chaired by Dr Peter Jefferys, today ruled his conduct was ‘sexually motivated’. Dr Jefferys told the medic: ‘In evidence you said that there was no motivation in your conduct, it was a light hearted gesture. ‘You said that you accept that it was wholly inappropriate. ‘The panel considered that it was wholly inappropriate to make any comment about the sexual activity of Patient B’s boyfriend. ‘The panel considered that in the context of having just made such an inappropriate remark about her boyfriend to a young woman asking for contraceptive advice and then inviting her to kiss you, your conduct was sexually motivated.’ The GP, who was suspended in November 2012 and left the practice the following month, admitted to the affair with Patient A, but denied some of her claims. Improper relationship: The 53-year-old bombarded the patient in her 40s with personal texts and made inappropriate comments in a 'long campaign to woo her', a tribunal heard . The panel, announcing their findings today, also found the outstanding allegations found proved after finding the woman was an ‘honest witness’. She had been registered at the surgery since 2000, but said her friendship with Dr Rubin began to develop in the summer of 2007 after he gave her his phone number in Tesco. The doctor hugged her during a consultation in July and asked: ‘Why don’t any of my patients wear nice underwear?’ The pair later exchanged phone numbers and began to exchange text and photo messages. He sent her a picture of an Anne Summers’ shop window and she sent a full-nude shot, the panel heard. She received a ‘strange’ package, which her partner, the father of her daughter, opened, containing an un-signed birthday card, mobile phone and SIM card, which the doctor later admitted sending after getting her details from medical records. Dr Rubin invited her to a ‘very uncomfortable’ lunch at a hotel in central Reading where he told her he intended to buy her a Christmas present and she decided to return the favour. Allegations: After having sex with the patient on Christmas Eve, 2007, Dr Rubin prescribed the morning after pill and said: 'You had better take this or it will be just my luck you will be standing in an antenatal clinic' She told the panel that the medic arranged a Christmas Eve appointment to exchange presents on the pretext of her being ill and seduced her. Giving evidence she said: ‘I just felt uncomfortable there. We were the only two people there in the whole of the surgery. ‘It was just low lighting. I guess at that stage he started making passes towards me. ‘I felt like I did at the restaurant. I froze. I didn’t go there for that sort of encounter. I had gone there simply to exchange presents. ‘He just kept pestering me and in the end he got his own way. I was not participating,’ she said. ‘He was very strong and forceful. Afterwards he then announced he had something to do on the computer before I could go. ‘He had already given me an antibiotic prescription and said you need to take this one and said it’s the morning after pill.’ She added: ‘I received a Christmas text from him, which I didn’t open and I didn’t want. I was very angry and didn’t want anything to do with him at all.’ He sent another text to apologise in which he referred to himself as a ‘bastard’ who always puts himself first, the panel heard. The Irish-trained GP continued to bombard her with texts and paid visits to her house during working hours, the tribunal was told. On one occasion in 2008 he ‘put her on the kitchen table’ in her partner’s house, which she shared with her two children, and started ‘fondling’ her, it was said. The GP insists that the relationship was entirely consensual and claims his mistress willingly had sex on several occasions at her home. ‘Some visits we just had coffee and a chat for half an hour. On some of them we had intercourse. The relationship was very intense,’ the doctor said, giving evidence. The relationship ‘fizzled out’ in 2008, although some text contact continued, and Dr Rubin was not reported until 2012 after an appointment with Patient A after she had a horse riding accident. Dr Rubin now says he knows the fling was ‘unacceptable and inappropriate’ and vows not to repeat his mistakes. He said: ‘It is an experience I do not wish to repeat. I am sorry for what happened and thoroughly ashamed and with the best will in the world I will do what I can to make sure this doesn’t happen again.’ Dr Rubin trained at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin before working at a number of hospitals in the UK. He qualified as a GP in 1990 and joined the Woodlands practice in 1998. The hearing, which is expected to last until April 8, continues.","Dr Peter Rubin, 53, bought gifts for the woman in her 40s, tribunal heard .

"By . Katy Winter . Forget designer handbags, a well-groomed dog, clad in the hottest canine fashions - customised coats, fashion collars and even doggy sunglasses are presently proving popular - is the latest trend rocking the UK. New research released today reveals that dogs are no longer seen as just man’s best friend, but also as a fashionable accessory, perhaps inspired by the four-legged stars of hit TV shows such as Made in Chelsea. Nearly one in 10 (8 per cent) Britons chose their dog because they deemed it a 'fashionable purchase', while a further one in 14 (7 per cent) dog owners admitted that their favourite celebrity inspired them to purchase their pet. Millie Mackintosh used her pet dog Herbie to help complete her summery look, as it is revealed 7% are inspired by a celebrity to buy their dog . The cast from Made In Chelsea were out filming in a pub in London yesterday, with Cheska, of course, being accompanied by her beloved Pomeranian Evie . Lucy Watson takes a stroll with her beloved German Spitz, Digby in a London park . And with E4’s popular series returning to our screens this Monday 7 April, dog owners up and down the country are getting ready to watch the doggy companions of the reality stars, who are becoming personalities in their own right. The show’s popular dog owners include Lucy Watson, who has a German Spitz called Digby and Binky Felstead who has a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Scrumble. Cheska Hull’s beloved canine companion is a Pomeranian called ‘Evie’ and she also has a Yorkshire Terrier called ‘Nellie’. Rosie Fortescue has a Dachshund called ‘Noodle’, while former cast member Millie Mackintosh has a French Bulldog called ‘Herby'. Nearly half of UK dog owners admit to owning breeds of dogs that feature in the show such as Binky's King Charles Spaniel 'Scrumble' Made In Chelsea star Francesca or 'Cheska', who is obviously one of the 17 per cent who have bought their dog a customised coat, regularly updates her followers on her pooch Evie . Cheska posts regular snaps on Twitter of Evie, her fluffy Pomeranian, who even has her own Twitter profile, with over 1,700 followers. Lucy Watson also updates Twitter on the antics of her German Spitz, Digby; as do Binky and Rosie, along with a few carefully-filtered Instagram pictures. Cost seems no object when it comes to buying the ideal dog: a third of UK dog owners say they shelled out between £251- £1,000 for their pet. On average, UK dog owners spend £70 a month feeding their dogs. However, this is only slightly more than how much they spend on grooming and buying accessories for their dogs, which is on average £57 a month. As well as paying for grooming, many owners buying their dogs expensive accessories. Binky also posted this snap of Scrumble with Made In Chelsea co-stars Francesca and Louise . Nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of owners have bought their dog a fashion collar. More than one in six (17 per cent) have bought their dog a customised coat, while 7 per cent have bought them shoes and 4 per cent have gone as far to buy them sunglasses for strolls in the park on those bright days. And it’s anything but a dog’s life for these pampered pooches, with a further 3 per cent purchasing doggy jewellery for their pets. Shockingly, 2 per cent of dog owners have even admitted to putting their dog in a pram. With E4's popular series returning to our screens this Monday 7 April, dog owners up and down the country are getting ready to watch the doggy companions of the reality stars . Sammy-Lea Samways, head of pet insurance at Confused.com, who conducted the research, says: 'Over the past few years the popularity of reality TV programmes such as Made in Chelsea has grown, which seems to have fuelled the desire for ‘designer dogs’ similar to those which feature in shows such as these. 'Purchasing a fashionable breed of dog to keep up with this celebrity trend could set people back as much as £1,1585, and this doesn’t account for extra costs such as grooming or fashion accessories that some dog owners seem to love. 'When thinking about how expensive these dogs can be, and with ongoing reports of dog theft, we want to make sure owners have adequate pet insurance in place.'","One in 14 admit a celebrity inspired their pooch purchase .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Confession: PC Christopher Kelly admitted attacking Michael Ijomanta (pictured), hurling a glass in his face and splitting his eyeball in two . A police officer split a man's eyeball in two leaving him blind in one eye after hurling a glass in his face when a brawl broke out a wedding. Constable Christopher Kelly, 28, smashed a tumbler into Michael Ijomanta's face causing two shards of glass to become lodged in his eye, and cuts all over his face. The PC, who is based in south Glasgow, admitted attacking Mr Ijomanta when a fight broke out at the Crutherland House Hotel in East Kilbride, Lanarkshire. Kelly, of Cambuslang, was one of 80 evening guests asked to the reception but ended the night on the other side of the cell door after detectives arrested him when called to reports of a disturbance. On Friday, Kelly appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court where he was smuggled into the court through a back door, before pleading guilty. Mr Ijomanta, 34, who travelled from Northamptonshire for his cousin's wedding, was left blind in one eye and disfigured as a result of the horrific injury. Prosecutor Natalie Henderson told the court Mr Ijomanta had been on the dance floor when an argument broke out shortly after midnight. She said: 'The argument became more heated and a scuffle broke out. 'The complainer made his way to the circle as he was concerned for the safety of his mother and family. 'There was a lot of pushing and shoving and the accused felt himself being pushed. 'The accused had a glass tumbler in his hand and as a result he turned and threw the tumbler in the direction he thought he had been pushed from. 'The glass went directly into the face of the complainer who was standing three feet away. 'The glass shattered on impact and the complainer fell to the ground screaming and holding his face.' Paramedics were called and Mr Ijomanta was taken to Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride. There, doctors discovered two pieces of glass stuck in his eye, and treated cuts to his forehead, cheek and nose. Ms Henderson added: 'His eye had two pieces of glass in it and the eyeball was almost split in two. 'A surgeon who has been working for 16 years described the injuries as one of the worst he had ever seen. Wedding brawl: The attack happened at the Crutherland House Hotel in East Kilbride (pictured) last April, when a fight broke out on the dancefloor at a wedding reception. Kelly has been warned he faces time in prison when he is sentenced next month . 'The accused was later interviewed and then charged where he made no comment.' PC Kelly, based in Glasgow's south side, was held in custody overnight by detectives. The court heard he had been allowed to work despite the charges he faced. Sheriff Shiona Waldron deferred sentence until next month and called for the probation service to compile reports. She warned Kelly, who has served as an officer for nearly four years, he faces jail but granted him bail. She added: 'You should be in no doubt what the likely outcome of this will be.' Mr Ijomanta declined to comment outside court.","Constable Christopher Kelly admitted attacking Michael Ijomanta .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Fitted on to shells during the First World War, they were designed to set off explosives which would maim and kill soldiers as they took cover in the trenches. But now hundreds brass firing caps recovered along the Western Front are being melted down and turned into poppies in order to raise money for the Royal British Legion. The metallic flowers, which will be sold either as cufflinks or lapel pins, are designed to mark the centenary of the War this year. The 1lb firing caps were fitted into the nose of shells such as these, ensuring they exploded on impact. Now the caps are being melted down and turned into poppies to raise money for the Royal British Legion . The conical 1lb fuses were fitted inside the nose of the shell and were originally made to detonate it as it hit an enemy target. They were once manufactured by their millions in munitions factories before being shipped to the battlefields. Speaking to The Telegraph, Brian Gray, the Royal British Legion’s Poppy Shop buyer, said: 'These poppies really are special. For us they are a direct link right back to the battlefields. It feels like reaching out and touching history. 'What is most remarkable is that these objects were created for war but are now being turned into an act of remembrance that will help the Legion and its dependents. It’s turning evil into good.' The design for each of the poppies is based on an actual flower preserved in the pages of a book by Private Len Smith, whose family agreed it could be used as the basis of a sculpture by York artist Stephen Allen. TMB Art Metal, which specialises in creating jewellery and works of art from the parts of cars, trains and aircraft, is in charge of making the poppies. The company was founded by Christopher Bennett in 2005 after a Battle of Britain Hurricane fighter which crashed on to Buckingham Palace Road was excavated, and parts of it were turned into artwork. The brass caps are melted down before being poured into a clay mould. Once the metal has set the poppy is removed, polished, and engraved with the dates 1914-1918. The design of the poppy is based on a real flower that was discovered pressed between the pages of a book kept by Private Len Smith (pictured, the Royal British Artillery fire at the enemy in France 1916) They are then presented in a velvet-lined wooden box with a certificate of authenticity. The mementos will go on sale on the British Legion's website in June, ahead of the centenary of  Britain's declaration of war on August 4, 1914. Money from the sale of each of the poppies will go to the Legion, with Mr Bennett only recovering the production cost of each one. He added: 'Considering that they are made of 100-year-old corroded detritus that has lain undisturbed on battlefields for so long, the transformation into beautiful poppies − looking for all the world like 18ct gold − is astonishing.'","Brass firing caps used to make shells explode on contact with target .

"By . Emma Glanfield . It was the final day of the Grand National Festival at Aintree today and many racegoers took it as their opportunity to wear their brightest, boldest and best outfits for the full day of gripping racing action. From fluorescent dresses and large fascinators for the women, to floral head-to-toe multi-coloured suits for the men - there were styles of all kinds on offer at the Liverpool racecourse. Despite yesterday being Ladies Day - with scores of women attending the day in their finest attire – dozens of females still used today’s final day of racing as an excuse to don their posh frocks and high heels. Scroll down for video . Here come the girls! A group of women pose in their brightly-coloured dresses as they soak up the atmosphere at the final day of racing at this year's Grand National Festival at Aintree Racecourse . Despite yesterday being Ladies Day at the course, women still put on their best frocks for today's final day of racing. One woman, left, was spotted arriving at the course in a sleek cream dress, black fascinator and towering high heels while two other ladies, right, posed for a selfie of themselves in their brightly-coloured dresses . The full day of racing appeared to be a bit much for some spectators and one woman was spotted sitting on the ground - despite there being plenty of empty chairs nearby . Despite wearing an expensive-looking  sleek black dress, this woman didn't seem to mind getting it dirty as she lay on the ground at the course as the day's racing came to an end . Some women opted for stylish ensembles, including two stunning ladies, left, who went for a chic monochrome look, while others opted for a brighter and bolder get-up, including one woman, right, who teamed a dusty pink mini dress with a hot pink blazer and chunky metallic wedge heels . The wet weather didn't dampen the spirit of racegoers and many women ensured they kept dry their hair and outfit dry with a trusty umbrella . One bride-to-be celebrated her hen do at the Grand National today, left, and appeared to be enjoying herself with a face mask while others were forced to shield under an umbrella, right, after rain hit the course this afternoon . As always, the women cranked up the glamour for the biggest day in the racing calendar, with many having applied fake tan, voluminous hair extensions and heavy make-up prior to putting on their brightly-coloured embellished dresses. Many looked stunning in their stylish ensembles, including two women who opted for sleek and chic monochrome dresses, and the majority of ladies opted for an outfit which gave a nod to the summer's floral and pastel trends. However, despite many making their best effort to look good, bouts of rain at the racecourse caused havoc with some of the well-turned out women who desperately tried to shield themselves from the wet weather with coats and ponchos. It wasn’t just the women who made all the effort today though – several men also tried to pick up style points with their choice of outfit. Four men could be seen wearing head-to-toe suits which were each printed differently with brightly-coloured graphics. One had a get-up which was covered in images of numerous packs of cards while another opted for a mismatched floral ensemble. Despite the wet weather, it didn’t dampen spirits at the course and thousands still enjoyed drinks aplenty as they watched the biggest race of the year – the Crabbie’s Grand National Chase.

Despite many women making their best effort to look good, bouts of rain at the racecourse caused havoc with some of the well-turned out women who desperately tried to shield themselves from the wet weather with coats and ponchos . Women used umbrellas, ponchos and coats to try and stop themselves from getting wet as the heavens opened at the racecourse as the festival came to a close . The long day did appear to take its toll on some spectators though – and many could be seen catching up on sleep at the course. One man, surrounded by discarded drinks cans, appeared to have passed out on the floor, while another woman looked worse for wear as she lay on the ground surrounded by empty chairs. There wasn’t quite as much action among spectators at the course today compared to yesterday though – when a fight broke out between three men. The men, all dressed in suits, shirts and ties, started brawling near to the finishing post and nearby spectators had to dodge the pints of beer which were sent flying during the ruckus. The majority of ladies opted for a glamorous take on the summer's floral and pastel trends while some others decided to play it safe with a darker colour. Due to the wet weather, most women teamed their fancy frock with a blazer, coat and umbrella . How patriotic! Three women try to shield themselves from the rain under a Union Jack flag umbrella, while two others opt for a see-through 'I hate rain' umbrella . Smile!

Despite the wet weather, it didn't dampen spirits at the course though and thousands still enjoyed drinks aplenty as they watched the biggest race of the year - the Crabbie's Grand National Chase . Some women appeared to be less-than-impressed with the wet and windy weather although others took it in their stride and didn't let it stop them enjoying the day out . While Cheltenham is famous for pearls and fur, and Royal Ascot for its hats, Aintree has become synonymous with fashionable girls out to have fun in the highest heels they can find. Eschewing cosy coats and tights in favour of goose-pimpled bare legs and delicate frocks, Aintree girls are almost as famous for their ability to withstand the cold as they are for their colouful approach to style. As with the Cheltenham Festival, organisers refuse to impose a dress code on guests and, beyond exhortations to dress smartly and avoid anything that might offend, say anything goes. But perhaps a warning isn't required: Liverpudlians are famous for their glamorous approach to getting dressed and love nothing more than the chance to strut their stuff in the most eye-catching outfits they can find. And more is definitely more when it comes to make-up and grooming too, with glossy long locks, honey-toned skin and lashings of lipgloss among the most popular beauty choices. Male racegoers aren't immune from the pull of equestrian glamour either, with the majority plumping for dapper suits or a blazer, although some decide to up the ante with a spot of fancy dress. Despite the presence of the infamous Becher's Brook on the course, the colourfully dressed Aintree crowd are enough to ensure that as many people watch the Grand National for the fashion as they do for the race itself. It wasn't just the women who opted for stylish ensembles - some men opted for smart get-ups too including this group who stood out from the crown in the bold trousers . The crowd cheer on the runners in the first race during Grand National Day of the Crabbie's Grand National 2014 Festival at Aintree Racecourse, Liverpool . Rain rain go away!

"By . Maureen Paton . It was a lottery like no other, with the fate of tiny children at stake on the pick of a ball. The street lights were lowered outside so that hundreds of mothers were granted anonymity as they queued at Georgian London's new Foundling Hospital in the 1740s to give their babies away. Unmarried women abandoned by their seducers or lovers, together with impoverished widows who couldn't support their newborns, hoped their children would have a better future inside the hospital -essentially a children's home - which educated and trained little boys to become apprentices, and little girls as servants. A scene from the BBC's Messiah At The Foundling Hospital . And such was the demand for places that a ballot system of white, red and black balls had to be introduced. A white ball meant a baby had won a place provided it didn't have an infectious disease; a red ball meant a child was put on the waiting list to replace those who failed their medical; and a black ball meant the baby was turned away. And there was a big audience for it, with fashionable society sponsors of the hospital crowding the public gallery to watch the heart-rending process in the room where the Court of Hospital Governors met. 'It was like some dreadful TV contest - yet it was a practical solution to a very real problem,' says Catherine Hogg, curator of an exhibition to mark ten years of the Foundling Museum which stands on the site of the old hospital and which forms the backdrop for a heart-tugging new BBC docu-drama about it. John Milner, the hospital's treasurer, had borrowed the blackballing idea from the membership selection at 18th-century London gentlemen's clubs such as White's. Contemporary witnesses, however, recalled that the wailing of bereft mothers whose babies had been chosen in this impossibly poignant contest was just as loud as those whose babies had been blackballed. They would leave tokens behind - scraps of embroidered cloth, poems and letters, medals, coins and even just walnuts by the poorest - to identify themselves and their babies in case they could come back to claim their offspring in happier times. Founder Thomas Coram, in 1855 . Yet since that meant repaying the hospital for the child's keep to ensure the feckless didn't abuse the system, 'Less than ten per cent of mothers did so over the two centuries that the hospital existed,' according to Caro Howell, director of the Foundling Museum. The hospital was started by a big-hearted former sailor and ship-builder called Thomas Coram, who was horrified at the number of babies abandoned in the London streets in the 1720s when he came home from his voyages. He had to campaign for 17 years for a Royal Charter, which he was granted in 1739, to establish the hospital as one of England's first children's charities. He was one of three childless men central to the success of the hospital. Both Coram and the painter William Hogarth, who became a governor, were married but with no heirs, while the composer George Frideric Handel, also a governor, was a bachelor. To raise funds, Hogarth exhibited his paintings at the hospital (and thus created Britain's first public art gallery), designed the children's uniforms and the coat of arms, and he and his wife Jane fostered foundling children, while Handel conducted his new Messiah masterpiece in its chapel in annual performances that brought in the crowds. It was the perfect link between philanthropy and the arts, with obvious benefits to both sides. And in what looks set to be TV's biggest baby tear-jerker since Call The Midwife, BBC2's Messiah At The Foundling Hospital will tell the whole story. Former EastEnders actor Paul Moriarty plays Coram, Christopher Staines is Hogarth and Paul McCreesh is Handel, with TV's At Home With The Georgians historian Amanda Vickery and music critic Tom Service presenting the dramatised excerpts. 'It's an incredibly moving subject to film,' says executive producer Ben Weston. 'We start by restaging the first night of Messiah at the hospital in 1750, and later show the blackballing contest and the babies' heads being inspected for lice. The children admitted were never allowed to know about the tokens their mothers had left in case they never came back; instead the boys and girls were identified by a lead number on a chain round their necks.' A painting entitled Foundling Girls In The Chapel At Prayer by Sophie Anderson . Caro Howell continues, 'For the first five years of their lives the children were fostered in the countryside – because it was healthier than London – before being brought back to the hospital to be educated and eventually apprenticed.' The regime was strict by our modern standards, with the system of removing the five-year-olds from their country foster parents an obvious wrench for both sides that continued until 1954 when the hospital finally closed. Yet governors took an interest in the children even after they'd left to become apprentices – and would use their powers to get any savage employers of their former charges arrested and punished. 'Foundling children were also among the first in Britain to be vaccinated,' says the show's co-producer Liz Hartford. At a time when child mortality was 99 per cent in the workhouses, the concern for the babies' health was such that governors became 'Inspectors of Wet Nurses', visiting their lodgings to make sure the women were married. To make doubly sure of no immorality, the inspectors were accompanied by their wives… . 'The women had to plead their cases and . prove the child was their first, that they were of previous good . character and not entirely the agents of their own misfortune' Caro Howell . By the 1830s, the increasing pressure on places meant that only illegitimate babies were admitted. 'The women had to plead their cases and prove the child was their first, that they were of previous good character and not entirely the agents of their own misfortune - and the governors would follow up with careful checks,' according to Caro Howell. Charles Dickens, who lived round the corner from the hospital in Doughty Street, became a sponsor, named his kindly Mr Brownlow in Oliver Twist after one of the hospital secretaries and wrote a play, No Thoroughfare, with novelist Wilkie Collins that begins at the gates of  the hospital. His benevolence even extended to putting in a good word for one mother, Susan Mayne - but, embarrassingly for him, the governors turned her application down after she was found to have syphilis. These days celebrities continue to keep up the museum's profile, with artist Grayson Perry and also the bestselling children's authors Jacqueline Wilson and Michael Morpurgo among its current patrons. Meanwhile the hospital lives on in the children's charity Coram, aptly named after the old sea-dog with the softest of hearts who founded it. Messiah At The Foundling Hospital is on BBC2 on 19 April.

"By . Nicole Lampert . We've had The Great British Bake Off, now it's what you might call The Great British Rake Off as a new BBC show pits more members of the public - this time gardeners - against each other in the hobby they love. And The Big Allotment Challenge is not for the weak-willed, insist the competitors - there are plenty of tears among the tomatoes and turnips. 'This is the tough end of reality television,' says Edd Curbishley, a Northamptonshire sales manager who competes in the show in partnership with his yoga teacher wife Harshani. Fern Britton with the judging panel of The Big Allotment Challenge, from left to right, Fern Britton, Jim Buttress, Thane Prince, Jonathan Moseley . 'It's nothing like those namby-pamby bakery programmes. This was four months of solid graft, and everyone rose to the challenge.' In the six-part series, presented by Fern Britton and filmed last year during the growing season, nine pairs of gardeners are given a patch of ground in the scenic gardens of Mapledurham House in Oxfordshire. JIM BUTTRESS . A Royal Horticultural Society judge and former head of Royal Parks . Greenwich, Jim’s a huge fan of  grow-your-own and is a regular sight . around the country judging allotment produce in his trademark bowler . hat. THANE PRINCE . Cook and author Thane used to appear on Ready, Steady Cook and is best . known for her books on chutneys and jams. She spent ten years running a . cookery school in Suffolk and now lives in London. JONATHAN MOSELEY . A resident of the Peak District and one of Britain’s leading floral . designers, Jim has been inspiring and entertaining audiences  with his . demonstrations, workshops  and classes for more than 20 years. They each have 15 weeks to work on their allotment for up to 30 hours a week in a bid to come up with prize-winning fruit, vegetables, flowers and herbs. Most of the contestants spend their entire weekends there after a week doing their day job. And not only do they have to be green-fingered - they must also show culinary and flower-arranging skills. Each week the contestants face three challenges, ranging from showing off their radishes and making bouquets from flowers they've grown to coming up with delicious conserves made from their produce. There are three expert judges: the Royal Horticultural Society's Jim Buttress, who looks at the quality of their produce, floral designer Jonathan Moseley, who gives the verdict on their flower arranging, and celebrity cook Thane Prince, who tastes their curds and jams. Silver-haired Jim has already been dubbed the Paul Hollywood of the gardening world, and several contestants go a bit dizzy over him. 'Oh, I'd start a Jim Buttress fan club,' says Michelle Stacey, a mother-of-two from Bexley in Kent. 'He has a way about him you just can't help loving. There's an attraction there that most women will get. He has the highest accolades in horticulture but he's never condescending.' But the real stars are the great British public, as assembled by the producers. Take Edd, 53, and Harshani, 45, who as well as trying to grow produce on a weekly timetable have the extra headache of trying to time their planting in  tune with the moon's phases. Contestants - Edd Curbishley and his wife Harshani . 'We've gardened bio-dynamically as a hobby for quite a few years now,' says Harshani. 'There's a two-week window when you can plant every month, and you're meant to plant different things - flowers, fruits, roots - on different days. It's all plotted out with science, looking at the light levels and energy to give them their best harvest.' But that isn't an easy system to follow when you're living more than an hour away from the patch you're tending. 'For the TV series, we only managed to do about 50 per cent of our growing bio-dynamically,' says Harshani sadly. 'We both work so we weren't always able to get there when we needed to.' However, the couple have a secret weapon: Harshani's yoga mantras, which she chants to the plants to give them good energy. 'It's something I do in the greenhouse at home,' she says. 'Plants are living things and they like that energy.' And what did their rivals think of this Prince Charles-like behaviour? 'Erm, they thought it was a bit different,' says Edd. But they aren't the only unconventional allotment growers among the show's contestants. Michelle Stacey and her mother-of-four sister-in-law Sally Green, both 44, are blonde, glamorous and like to wear vintage dresses and heels while gardening. 'We use our heels as diggers and false . nails to scoop up seeds. We're certainly not . stereotypical gardeners - when we first turned up on our allotment we . got some funny looks'Michelle Stacey . 'We use our heels as diggers and false nails to scoop up seeds,' says Michelle, laughing. 'We're certainly not stereotypical gardeners - when we first turned up on our allotment we got some funny looks, but once people got to know us they could see that we knew what we were doing. She continues, 'There are lots of stereotypes about gardeners; on TV they're usually men wearing flat caps. We want to prove a point - that anyone can garden. I get sick of the shows where only middle-class men are allowed to have an opinion on gardening.' Their passion for gardening started when Michelle's parents got an allotment. 'When they first started we all said, “What have you got an allotment for?” But then we fell in love with it. It's a brilliant way of getting organic fruit and veg without paying supermarket prices.' They admit to having been among the teariest of the contestants. 'There were lots of tears, especially when someone had to go,' says Michelle. But she adds, 'We know we look a bit fluffy but we knew we could use the fact that people would underestimate us to our advantage.' Others have secret weapons of their own. For teacher Kate Bennett and her best friend of over 30 years, retired university lecturer Eleanor Waterhouse, it's llama droppings. The pair, from Winchester, Hampshire, both 63, each have a llama: Latimer (named after the character Lumpy Latimer from a Joyce Grenfell sketch) and Llama (pronounced 'Yama', in the Spanish fashion). Sally Green and her sister-in-law Michelle Stacey . 'I found out the properties of llama droppings when I went to a llama farm and the farmer collected some, saying it can sell on the internet for a fantastic price,' says Kate. 'A few years ago my husband and I got the chance to buy a neighbour's field so we thought we couldn't do better than buy an aesthetic lawnmower - a llama. So we bought two boys, and Eleanor and I collect their droppings and use it on our garden. It's good for everything from root vegetables to roses and was our secret weapon; we knew no one else would have it.' Meanwhile, IT specialists and best friends Gary Murdock, 46, and Pete Taylor, 42, have more of a game plan than a secret weapon. The pair, who share an allotment in Hove, East Sussex, admit their main aim is to not come last. 'We specialise in doing as little as possible but having successful results,' says Pete. 'We have our own website which shows our successes and our mistakes; we're open about how rubbish we are.' Rather than working, they enjoyed the social aspect of the show; all the contestants have come away as firm friends after spending so many weekends together. 'The closest we came to hard work was watching everyone else doing it,' adds Pete. The pair are a contrast to the duo the others deemed the most competitive: teacher Ed Bond, 37, and his wife's best friend's father Alex Lomax, who's retired. The Wiltshire pair had never gardened together before the show - Alex, 68, stepped in when Ed's first partner pulled out because of the time commitment needed - but they quickly found a common love in organisation. While other contestants jot their plans on the backs of envelopes, these two have whiteboards. 'Why would you enter a competition and not want to win?' says Alex. 'We were competitive in an open way and if anyone asked us about our plans we'd generally tell them. And we helped another team out when they lost some seedlings. I'd say a few of the teams were probably even more competitive but with a more covert style.' Even these two had their teary-eyed moments, though. 'Erm yes, when we realised we were candidates for elimination and also when some of our friends went,' says Alex. But despite the rivalry and tears, this appears to have been a peculiarly friendly competition. 'Yes, there were 18 of us and we were all very different in many ways, but we had one thing in common,' says Kate. 'We all love growing.' The Big Allotment Challenge starts on 15 April at 8pm on BBC2. The accompanying book is published by Hodder & Stoughton on Thursday, £20.","A new series on BBC2 will put gardeners to the test .

"These adorable baby twins born 14 weeks early have finally been reunited after being separated for five months while one struggled for life in the hospital. Grace and Olivia Oman were both born weighing just 1lb 14oz and for a while it was touch and go as to whether they would survive. Olivia was released from hospital in October but Grace suffered from breathing problems and remained apart from her twin until she too was allowed home this week. Together again: Grace and Olivia have been reunited after spending five months apart following their premature birth. while Olivia went home, Grace had to stay for treatment . Little fighters: Mother Vicki Oman, from Morpeth, Northumberland, cradling her twin girls . While they were separated mother Vicki, 28, tenderly placed a teddy bear wearing Olivia’s clothes in Grace’s incubator so that she would feel as though her sister was close. Now, after months of waiting, the family, including dad Mark, 26, a technician, and three-year-old brother Jake, are all settled back at their home in Morpeth, Northumberland. Mrs Oman, a paediatric staff nurse, said: 'Grace loves smiling and playing and both the girls are doing really well and reaching the same milestones together. 'It has been a very stressful and emotional time but I’m just looking ahead to having my whole family in one place and getting back to normal.' All together now: Vicki, Grace and Olivia share a cuddle with father Mark and big brother Jake, three . She added: 'Being able to tuck them all up at night under the same roof is the best feeling ever because I was so worried it wouldn’t happen. 'The changes are just incredible to see in them all and it really is a blessing to have my family all together. 'Having the two girls separated for so long was heart-breaking. 'We put a teddy bear with Olivia’s clothes on in Grace’s incubator at the hospital so she always felt like her sister was there, it always settled her. 'When we got them both home they have bonded so much and even hold each other’s hands when they’re lying next to each other.' Although Olivia is now breathing by herself Grace has floppy airways, which means she will have a tracheostomy for the next two to three years of her life. Mrs Oman had originally been carrying triplets and it was after losing Eleanor at 14 weeks that difficulties started in her pregnancy. Grace, pictured shortly after birth, still has a tracheotomy but is finally at home with her sister . Survivor: Olivia after she was born. Vicki, 28, tenderly placed a teddy bear wearing Olivia's clothes in Grace¿s incubator so that she would feel as though her sister was close . The waters around Grace broke and it was feared the family would lose her as well as her lungs wouldn’t develop properly without the fluid. But the waters built back up and everything seemed stable. Then at 25 weeks she was taken to Wansbeck General Hospital in Ashington, Northumberland, with contractions and in the early hours of July 26 she gave birth to the identical twin girls. But while Olivia was stable and could leave hospital a few months later, Grace had to be transferred to Newcastle’s RVI hospital where she was fitted with a tracheostomy to help her breathe. She will now have this tracheostomy until she is around three-years-old when her airways have been strengthened. The mother-of-three said: 'They were delivered at Wansbeck hospital but then taken to Middlesborough’s James Cook and I followed the next day. Loving: Grace (left) and Olivia grip their mother's finger shortly after birth . 'The neonatal intensive care unit was fantastic and I really can’t thank them enough for everything they have done for my baby girls. 'With Grace having the tracheostomy I was terrified as I had some experience of them with being a nurse but I never expected to have to have this for my own child. 'The staff at the hospitals and all the nurses that still come to our house have been amazing in giving me and Mark the training to deal with Grace’s extra care and needs. 'Even Jake is involved in helping us care for Grace as he knows where different things are and can get them for us and also helps to amuse Olivia while we are busy with Grace. 'It is not the regular routine that most families have but it is what we have been given and so now it is just normal to us. 'It doesn’t bother me that Grace needs all the extra care as she has been through so much in her short life and we are just glad to have her and Olivia at home with us.' Although Olivia (right) is now breathing by herself, Grace has floppy airways, which means she will have a tracheostomy for the next two to three years of her life . The family now can’t wait to familiarise themselves with a routine that is bound to be hectic with regular hospital appointments and a lot of new experiences. Mrs Oman said: 'The other day we decided to go to Asda and couldn’t believe how much work there was in getting ourselves and the three children to do a simple shop. 'Grace has a lot of extra things to have with her, such as her oxygen and support for her tracheostomy, so just a trip out for us would take ten times more effort than most other families. 'Getting to go out and do those things was so precious to us though as so far we have only been able to take Grace around the hospital. 'For the past eight months our lives have revolved around going to and from the hospital and getting to do such simple things, such as shopping, with all of our children was just so special for us. 'We live within a very close community so just walking around Asda we were stopped by almost everyone who wanted to be updated on Grace’s progress. 'Without this strong community, fantastic family and friends and the amazing work of the doctors and nurses I don’t think we would have got through it all. 'Seeing the girls achieve different milestones, such as rolling over for the first time which they both did together this week, makes it all worthwhile and makes the struggle we’ve had seem like it was nothing.' Mr and Mrs Oman, along with friends and family, have raised £1,800 to split between the two hospitals as a thank you for all their help. They already donated the money for a freezer to store breast milk for the hospital and hope that the further money they raise will go a long way in improving the help the hospital already gives.","Grace and Olivia Oman weighed just 1lb 14oz when they were born .

"By . James Chapman . John Holden: The Director of Systems Policy has received a 50 per cent pay increase . Senior NHS managers have shared more than £300,000 in pay rises as a result of the Government’s reorganisation of the Health Service, despite remaining in apparently identical posts. Department of Health directors whose jobs were moved to the NHS England quango have enjoyed startling rises, official figures suggest. Other regional directors of public health, now employed by Public Health England, another quango, have also had huge rises. Labour said the increases, revealed by ministers in a series of Parliamentary answers, were incredible, especially because doctors and nurses have had to accept real-terms pay cuts. NHS England, the new quango responsible for running the Health Service, has taken on large numbers of senior staff previously employed by the Department of Health, while Public Health England is now in charge of health protection. The figures given to Parliament show that John Holden, the director of system regulation at the Department of Health, received an extra £40,000, a 50 per cent pay rise, as the director of systems policy at NHS England. Ben Dyson, director of commissioning policy and primary care at the department, had a £30,000 rise even though his title at NHS England stayed exactly the same. Richard Murray, a financial director, also received a £35,000 rise after moving to NHS England and Miles Ayling, director of innovation, saw his pay rise by £30,000 when he moved to the same quango. Jo-Anne Wass, former chief of staff at the department, is to be paid up to £300,000 over two years after leaving her NHS England job. Miss Wass, 46, had a rise of around £15,000 when she was made ‘national director of HR’ at the quango. She is a close ally of NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson, the ‘man with no shame’, who has retired following controversy over the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal over patient mortality. Miss Wass is understood to have arranged an unpaid consultancy role at Leeds University before Sir David’s departure. NHS England has said it will continue to pay her salary for up to two years because she was ‘on secondment’, even though she will not return. Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘The scandalous waste caused by David Cameron’s NHS re-organisation gets worse the more we find out about it. Nurses and midwives, who have been told that they will not receive even a 1 per cent pay increase this year, will find these revelations utterly galling. ‘It seems people at the top have done very nicely out of Mr Cameron’s re-organisation but those at the bottom are told there’s no money left. No wonder NHS staff morale has hit rock bottom under this Government.’ The figures were revealed following the Department of Health’s admission last month that 3,950 NHS managers had received redundancy payments – 330 being given more than £200,000 – during last year’s re-organisation, only to return to work in the new bodies. Labour MP John Spellar said it was ‘outrageous’ that ‘the fat cats at the top are getting monstrous payouts and then being re-employed straightaway elsewhere in the NHS’. Health minister Dr Dan Poulter told the Commons: ‘The redundancy terms were negotiated when Andy Burnham was a minister for the Department of Health … Unfortunately, because of the terms set by the previous government, some managers are still treated better than patients.’ An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Over a year ago, a small number of people won promotion to new roles in NHS England. There are 20,500 fewer administration roles in the NHS than four years ago.’ Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said: ‘The salaries were not enhanced on joining PHE and were approved by the Cabinet Office. The current salaries incorporate NHS national Clinical Excellence Awards.’ A Department of Health spokesman said all the staff involved had come off the Whitehall payroll and on to the books of the quangos.","Shocking rises come as doctors and nurses accept real-terms pay cuts .

"By . Bianca London . Jessica Wright found fame as one of the original TOWIE girls when hair extensions, figure-hugging bandage dresses and lashing of fake tan were all the rage. But the reality TV star says she's had a style overhaul since finding fame and her new clothing collection reflects that. Speaking to MailOnline as she launches her SS14 range, Jessica, 28, said: 'My new collection is different to my past offerings because I've really changed my style. When I used to look in the mirror, I didn't like what I saw and couldn't stand my look but I have totally revamped my style.' Scroll down for video . New look: Jessica has unveiled her SS14 collection and says it reflects her new sophisticated style (£65) Jessica, who once had a penchant for hair extensions, admits that she'll 'never have long hair again' and her recent shorter hair style was inspired by Tamera Foster from X Factor. 'My new hair really suits me, it's classy. I've realised I'm 28 now, not 21. 'Ultimately, to be glamorous you don't have to wear skin-tight dresses and that's why my new range focuses around knee-length dresses, sophisticated prints and tailored blazers.' Summer picks: Jessica's trend-led collection of neon and lace dresses aims to flatter all body types (£60) Hot picks: Jessica thinks that Michelle Keegan, her future sister-in-law, would be great in this jumpsuit (left) and reveals that her new hairstyle was inspired by Tamera Foster from X Factor . Jess has taken note of the season's catwalks and incorporated lace into her designs because it 'never goes out of fashion' and there's a big focus on co-ordinated pieces and sculpted dresses. One customer Jessica has her eye on is her soon-to-be sister-in-law Michelle Keegan, who recently got engaged to Jessica's brother Mark. 'Michelle has such a stunning body and classy style so she will love my range and will look fabulous in my jumpsuits,' she said. Jessica, who is currently dating co-star Ricky Rayment, said she gives her boyfriend style advice 'all the time' and has helped him 'smarten his look'. She is, however, sometimes on the receiving end of it. 'I will ask Ricky if I look nice in something but I swear he sometimes tells me I look bad when I actually look good and I'm thinking: ""Are you just saying that because I actually look sexy?"", she laughs. 'I don't always trust his advice. He once said I looked awful in an outfit but then it got really good reviews but he's sometimes right.' New glamour: Jessica says she has embraced a new style, which is reflected in her sophisticated new range . Style tips: Jessica, who poses on set in Morocco, says that she and Rocky often exchange style advice - even if she doesn't always trust his . Jessica says she often struggles to stick to a healthy eating regime and while she loves salad and vegetables, she craves sugar and biscuits 'all the time'. Aside from her fashion duties, Jessica is currently working on her music career, which she says will be unveiled in the summer, as well as a range of fruity tans that she promises 'smell amazing and nothing like curry.'

"By . Emma Innes . An Indonesian baby has been born with a huge tumour on the right side of his face, causing his head to become heart-shaped. Muhammad Nafi, who is two weeks old, has a massive growth which has been increasing in size rapidly since before he was born. He has been left with a drastically swollen and misshapen head. Muhammad Nafi has a huge, and rapidly growing, tumour on the right-hand side of his face . Now, his parents are desperately trying to raise money to pay for him to have treatment. Muhammad is the second child of mother Mailani, 22, and father Buasin, 32, who works as a farmer in a remote and isolated area of West Kalimantan. ‘I am confused of what I have to do with my son. I can only submit myself to the fate,’ Mrs Nafi said. Muhammad is currently being cared for at St Antonius Hospital in Pontianak, the capital of West Kalimantan province. He was born weighing a healthy 7lbs with the help of a midwife. His mother said she experienced no major problems during her pregnancy, although she did feel nauseous from the fourth month onwards. Muhammad's parents are desperately trying to raise money for him to have surgery to remove the tumour . However, because the couple live so far from a hospital, she was forced to rely on medicine from small shops in nearby villages. Mr Nafi said: ‘Well, what else should I do? I'm completely flustered. I can only be resigned to accept it. ‘At first my son was hospitalised in Sukadana in Kayong Utara Region, then he was referred to be taken care at a hospital in Ketapang Region. ‘There, they couldn't do much for my son's disease either. Therefore, we took our son to the Regional Public Hospital (RSUD).’ The tumour has prevented part of Muhammad's skull forming properly meaning surgery to remove it would leave his brain exposed . However, unhappy with the treatment their son received there, the couple transferred him to St Antonius. The parents are now trying to raise funds to pay for the growth to be removed, although surgery will have to be delayed until Muhammad is at least three months old. At present, the operation is considered too risky as the tumour has left the baby's skull open and unformed on the right half of his face, leaving his brain exposed. Muhammad's mother says her pregnancy was normal but that she felt nauseous from the fourth month . The tumour has affected the functioning of Muhammad right eye, but more extensive examinations are needed to see if his other organs are working normally. ‘Hopefully my son will be recovered soon,’ Mr Nafi said. ‘Some people have already helped, but it isn't enough yet. In fact, there hasn't been any help from the local government of Kayong Utara Region.’ MailOnline is attempting to establish where donations can be sent.","Muhammad Nafi, who is two weeks old, was born with a huge facial tumour .

"By . Mark Prigg . They are beautiful images that reveal just how much we have come to rely on sea transport. The amazing images show the huge expansion of cargo routes around the world. As routes like the Suez Canal opened in 1869, they reveal just how much of the globe is now used to transport goods, with some estimates claiming 90% of the goods we use have been transported by sea at some point. Shipping routes from 1980 to 1997, based on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, showing the vast number of routes now being used. The data was obtained from decades of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set. Once plotted on a map, they create a series of maps that show shipping lanes in black. The first map, showing 1784-1863 is known as the MAURY map. Many of the trips shown are believed to be whaling expiditions. An assistant professor of history at Northeastern University, Ben Schmidt, created a series of maps that display the worldâ€™s modern shipping routes. When viewed together, the routes create an inverted map of the world. The data was obtained from decades of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set. Once plotted on a map, they create a series of maps that show shipping lanes in black. Mr Schmidt also says they reveal that governments have long collected data on people's movements. 'These data snapshots are fascinating and revealing snapshots of how the state used to and continues to pull in information from the world,' he said. He admits that the data used to create them is incomplete - but says they still show government surveillance has always existed. This map is based on shipping routes from the 19th century. It shows routes principally around North and South America, Europe, and Africa. Just a few routes, depicted by faint lines, run to Asia.

Many of the earlier trips were whaling expeditions. 'Of course, on the surface, it seems to show 19th century shipping routes: that's the primary reason it's interesting. 'But it's an obviously incomplete, obviously biased, and obviously fragmentary view of those routes. 'It's a relatively complete view, on the other hand, of something more restricted but nearly as interesting: the way that the 19th century American state was able to see and take measure of the world. 'No one, today, needs to be told that patterns of state surveillance, data collection, and storage are immensely important. 'Charts like these provide an interesting and important locus for seeing how states 'saw,' to commandeer a phrase from James Scott.'

"By . Sophie Borland . Electronic cigarettes could be included in the smoking ban in Wales, under proposals unveiled yesterday. Ministers fear they glamorise smoking and act as a gateway to normal cigarettes. Around one million Britons are thought to be using e-cigarettes, which are battery operated and look like regular cigarettes. Scroll down for video . Wales is poised to become the first part of the UK to ban e-cigarettes in enclosed public places, as health ministers introduce a new proposal to a White Paper on health reform. They fear the devices, used by celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, are 'normalising' smoking . There are no plans to ban them in England, although yesterday the chief medical officer raised concerns about their safety. E-cigs . contain liquid nicotine which is released when the user inhales, giving . a similar rush to cigarettes without harmful tobacco. But little . research has been carried out into their risks. Mark Drakeford, health minister in the Labour-run Welsh government, said he is afraid they are 'normalising' smoking again. 'We . have spent 30 years creating a climate in this country where people . understand that smoking is not glamorous or desirable,' said Mr . Drakeford. 'We are . concerned that e-cigarettes might reverse that tide and act as a gateway . to conventional cigarettes. 'It contains nicotine, it's highly addictive . and you might then find it easier to move on to conventional . cigarettes.' Welsh health minister Mark Drakeford said he wants to prevent a new generation becoming addicted to nicotine . He announced proposals to ban them in indoor public places . such as pubs and restaurants. He also proposed a minimum price per alcohol unit of 50p. 'Alcohol and tobacco are major causes of persistent inequalities in health,' he added. His . proposals are in a white paper that has been put out for consultation. A . spokesman for the Department of Health said there were no current plans . to ban e-cigs in England. However, . Dame Sally Davies said: 'We are normalising e-cigarettes. If they were . regulated as a medicine and we knew what was in them and the dose of . nicotine, then they might play a useful role in stopping smoking. But . they aren't, so at the moment we don't know their safety or the dose . they deliver. 'Flavourings are often attractive to children – cookies and cream and bubblegum. 'They are sold rather cheaply and many are made in China, so I worry about what's in them. 'I am also worried about once again making smoking seem like a normal activity.' E-cigs . were first made available in 1963 but it is only in the last ten years . they have become widely used. In 2009, the Food and Drugs Administration . in the US found some contain chemicals that cause cancer known as . tobacco-specific nitrosamines. Last year the World Health Organisation . warned that the high levels of nicotine may cause addiction – which may . lead users to switch to regular cigarettes. France . has pledged to ban  e-cigs in public places after the country's health . agency warned about the possible side-effects of the nicotine content. The British Medical Association said it has fears about safety and the high levels of nicotine. But . senior doctors from the Royal College of Physicians say if all smokers . worldwide switched to e-cigs then five million deaths could be prevented . every year. E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices marketed as a way of helping people quit smoking . Electronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices which simulates smoking. The design was patented in 1963, and uses a heating element known as an atomiser that vaporises a liquid solution. Some e-cigarettes contain a mixture of nicotine and flavourings, will others release a flavoured nicotine-free vapour. They are sold in flavours like chocolate and strawberry that are banned in conventional cigarettes because of their appeal to young people. The devices are largely designed to look like cigarette and are marketed as a method of helping people quit the habit. But experts have widely debated the benefits of e-cigarettes. A recent study by scientists at the University of California's Centre for Tobacco Control Research and Education in San Francisco has shown teenagers who use the battery powered devices are more likely to smoke traditional cigarettes and less likely to quit smoking, the research showed. As the popularity of e-cigarettes - promoted as a way to help people quit smoking - increases, scientists have found that ‘the wild west marketing of e-cigarettes is not only encouraging youth to smoke them, but also it is promoting regular cigarette smoking among youth’. 'Despite claims that e-cigarettes are helping people quit smoking, we found that e-cigarettes were associated with more, not less, cigarette smoking among adolescents,’ said lead author of the study Lauren Dutra. She added: ‘E-cigarettes are likely to be gateway devices for nicotine addiction among youth, opening up a whole new market for tobacco.’ A study of nearly 40,000 youngsters in the U.S. found that e-cigarette use among school students doubled between 2011 and 2012, from 3.1 per cent to 6.5 per cent.","Ministers say they are concerned e-cigarettes normalise smoking .

Black Bone Disease – also known as Alkaptonuria (AKU) – which causes . their urine and bones to turn black. If the drug trial is successful, the pill could be offered to all patients with the same genetic condition. Julien (left) and Daniel (right) Sireau both have a genetic condition called Back Done Disease which causes their bones and urine to turn black. It also causes early-onset osteoarthritis and, possibly, heart disease . The boys' father, Nick (pictured with Daniel), gave up his job in 2010 to help find a cure for the condition. He believes a treatment has now been identified and is about to launch a clinical trial . Dr Sireau told MailOnline: ‘We are really pleased. It’s fantastic. ‘We are really excited that the trial is about to start because there has been so much work to get to this point. We are also apprehensive even though we are pretty confident the results will be good.’ Without treatment, as they get older they will develop severe early-onset osteoarthritis and are at risk of brittle bones and heart disease. The genetic disease also causes the bones, cartilage, urine and earwax to turn black. Dr Sireau, from Cambridge, was so desperate to help his children that he gave up his job as CEO of a charity called SolarAid in 2010 to work for the AKU Society. Currently Julien (right) and Daniel (left) are healthy but they will start to develop symptoms in early adulthood unless a treatment is found . He has now helped organise the clinical trial which he believes could offer a life-saving solution for his children, and for other AKU sufferers. The trial, which will start on April 14, will see 42 patients attend a centre in Liverpool where half will be given the drug Nitisinone. The drug is already licenced to treat patients with another rare disease and could become widely available to AKU patients if the trial is successful in showing it can stop the disease progressing. In total, 70 patients will be given the drug during the four year trial which will be run from centres in Liverpool, Paris and Slovakia. Black Bone Disease causes bone and cartilage to become discoloured. Image shows the elbow joint of an anonymous sufferer . The medical side of the trial is being funded by the European Commission but the organisers had to raise $98,000 to pay for patient transport, carers for the more disabled patients and to provide support for patients. They achieved this in the autumn meaning the trial can now start. If the trial is successful, the treatment could be made available on the NHS within the next five years. The trial organisers hope it could stop the disease progressing in older patients who already have symptoms and that it could prevent symptoms developing in younger patients. They say patients would just need to take a tablet each day for the rest of their lives. Dr Sireau said: ‘Personally, this means hope for my kids and for all of the patients. ‘We hear the most horrible stories of people having to stop work and becoming depressed because of the symptoms. ‘For me, it is important my kids don’t suffer this pain.’ The boys are currently healthy but without treatment will eventually start to develop symptoms such as joint problems and back pain – the early symptoms of osteoarthritis. These symptoms could develop at any time from their mid-teens to their 40s. The osteoarthritis suffered by Black Bone Disease patients is caused by a toxic acid called homogentisic acid (HGA) attacking their bones and cartilage, turning them black and brittle. In people with AKU, the acid accumulates at 2,000 times the normal rate. Julien was diagnosed as a baby when his parents noticed his nappies were black - until then they did not realise they carried the gene mutation. There was a 25 per cent chance Daniel would also be affected . This also causes discolouration of the ears and black spots in the eyes. There is also a growing link between AKU and heart disease. This is because toxic acid called homogentisic acid HGA causes the blood vessels and valves in the heart to harden, turning them black, brittle and less effective at managing the flow of blood around the body. Although this is still believed to be an uncommon symptom of AKU, it is a potentially fatal consequence of the disease. AKU can also cause several other symptoms, such as kidney, prostate and bladder stones, black or dark sweat or a blue speckled discolouration of the skin. However, the clinical trial gives hope that all sufferers of Black Bone Disease will soon be able to live a normal life without developing any symptoms. Dr Sireau (pictured with Julien) believes the drug Nitisinone could prevent acid building up in patients and, therefore, prevent symptoms developing. The drug is already used to treat another rare disease . Dr Sireau believes Nitisinone could prevent HGA building up in patients and, therefore, prevent symptoms developing. He told MailOnline: ‘My hope is that my children never have to feel the pain of the symptoms – that they just won’t have to worry about it.’ Just after Julien was born, Dr Sireau and his wife, Sonya, noticed that his nappies were turning black. They called an emergency doctor who thought the problem was caused by his mother eating red cabbage and then breastfeeding him. If the drug trial is successful, the treatment could become available on the NHS within five years. Image shows Sonya Sireau . However, his parents were not convinced so took him to a GP who sent a range of tests to Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital. When the tests were analysed, they revealed that Julien has Black Bone Disease which is a genetic disorder caused by a recessive gene. Dr Sireau said: ‘It took a lot of time to sink in. Doctors told us there was nothing we could do – that was very disempowering. ‘It took us a while to start realising that we could do something.’ Dr Sireau (pictured with Daniel) said: 'Personally, this means hope for my kids and for all of the patients. We hear the most horrible stories of people having to stop work and becoming depressed because of the symptoms. For me, it is important my kids don't suffer this pain' When the couple had their second child, Daniel, they knew there was a 25 per cent chance that he would also have the condition. Dr Sireau explained that after he was born, they kept checking his nappies for fear they too would go black. He said: ‘We were checking Daniel’s nappies again and again. It was so sad when it happened but we try to be positive. ‘We are given a chance to find a cure because the disease doesn’t affect them as children.’ For more information, visit www.developakure.eu . Black Bone Disease, also known as Alkaptonuria (AKU), is a rare genetic disease which causes early-onset osteoarthritis. It is caused by the lack of an enzyme called homogentisic dioxygenase which means that patients cannot fully breakdown a toxic acid called homogentisic acid. As a result, the acid builds up in the body at 2,000 times the normal rate. The first symptom is usually black urine. Other symptoms do not usually develop until the patient is in their 20s. At this stage, the patients tend to develop joint problems and back pain which is the start of osteoarthritis. This eventually causes the bones to become brittle and can be very disabling. The condition can also cause the eyeballs, sweat and earwax to turn black. It is thought there is also a link between AKU and potentially fatal heart disease. This is because HGA causes the blood vessels and valves in the heart to harden, turning them black, brittle and less effective at managing the flow of blood around the body. AKU is caused by a genetic mutation - it is a recessive disorder meaning the AKU gene must be carried by both of the patient's parents. If both parents are carriers, there is a 25 per cent chance of their child developing the condition. The condition is thought to occur in about one in every 250,000 to 500,000 people.

"By . Daniel Postgate . Bagpuss must be the best loved pink-and-white cat in television history. His enduring popularity is one of the reasons the little stop-motion animation series made by my father Oliver Postgate and his creative partner Peter Firmin is still being voted Britain's favourite children's TV series decades after it was first broadcast. But he very nearly wasn't pink and white at all. Peter, whose idea it was to make a series about a magical cat whose thoughts could be seen, wanted Bagpuss to be marmalade and white but when the special fluffy fabric came back from the dyers something had gone wrong: the stripes weren't remotely orange, they were pink. Bagpuss, the famous pink and white cat, turns 40 this year . Peter, however, decided to go with the creative flow - something he and my father did a lot - and pressed ahead. And so it was that Bagpuss 'the most important, the most beautiful, the most magical... saggy old cloth cat in the whole wide world' was born. By the time Bagpuss was first broadcast in 1974, I was a sophisticated ten-year-old, so it didn't matter at all to me that the human star of the show was Emily Firmin, the youngest of Peter's six daughters and my regular friend and playmate. Besides, I'd already had my own go in front of my father's camera, playing a guard in another of their TV shows, Pogles' Wood. I'm now a cartoonist-turned-illustrator-turned-writer, and spend part of my time looking after Smallfilms, the company my father created in the 50s and through which he and Peter made such much-loved children's classics as Ivor The Engine, Noggin The Nog and The Clangers, as well as Bagpuss. Bagpuss with his creator, Oliver Postgate . Bagpuss was shot in the big barn at Peter's farm - a dusty, mysterious but definitely magical place - using a camera that Dad had modified to shoot a single frame at a time using bits of Meccano. That habit of making do and mending is very much at the heart of Bagpuss, with each of the 13 episodes beginning with a lost object that Emily had found and Dad's narration kicking off each story with the magical words... 'Bagpuss, dear Bagpuss, . 'Old fat, furry cat-puss, . 'Wake up and look at this thing that I bring.' And with that Bagpuss would wake up, the picture turned from sepia to colour and the mice from the mouse-organ would get busily to work, cheerily cleaning up the lost object, while Bagpuss told a story, helped and hindered by Madeleine the rag-doll, Gabriel the banjo-playing toad and Professor Yaffle, the blustering and fearsomely intellectual wooden woodpecker. Along the way, there'd be some sort of lovely folk-song too, beautifully sung by John Faulkner and Sandra Kerr, who respectively provided the voices for Gabriel and Madeleine. Dad, who'd been to drama school as well as art college, had the most wonderful voice for telling stories, a voice that I've learned, since he died in 2008 aged 83, was woven into the childhoods of millions of children who grew up in the 60s and 70s. For Bagpuss, he provided the voices of the narrator, Bagpuss and Professor Yaffle, the latter being secretly based on the great radical philosopher, Bertrand Russell, who my father knew as a child. Dad's own father, my grandfather, was Raymond Postgate, who somehow managed to combine being a highly regarded left-wing historian with setting up the annual restaurant guidebook The Good Food Guide, and Russell had been a regular visitor to their north London home. Russell's high-minded, slightly halting delivery had clearly left its mark on Dad but the decision to give Yaffle similar vocal characteristics was an affectionate one for he and Dad shared many similar views, particularly when it came to pacifism and nuclear disarmament. Daniel revealed that he is working on a new series of the Clangers . Some of these views he secretly passed on to Bagpuss, a fact he took great pleasure in revealing when the University of Kent presented Peter and him with honorary degrees at Canterbury Cathedral in 1987. They'd taken Bagpuss along as guest of honour, with Dad proudly announcing to the assembled throng that the pink-and-white cat was definitely 'a Miaow-ist'. In 1999 Bagpuss was voted Best Children's TV Programme in a BBC poll, an accolade that delighted Dad and Peter and caused sales of merchandise - and particularly of pink-and-white cats - to go through the roof. Suddenly, after decades of just scraping by, they had some money. Characteristically, they spent a big chunk of it paying for a new wing to be built for a Romanian children's hospice. Dad said it was what Bagpuss would have wanted. 'Dad  had the most wonderful voice for telling stories, a . voice that I've learned was woven into . the childhoods of millions of children who grew up in the 60s and 70s' Bagpuss may have been filmed in a converted Kent barn but, for its 40th anniversary, we've just had it digitally restored. All 13 episodes look absolutely wonderful - Dad would have been proud and I know Peter is because he still lives just down the road, as does Emily, who is now an artist. Although Peter technically retired last year, at 85 he's busier than ever, and we're working on a new series of The Clangers. I'm writing the scripts and Peter is the design consultant, and he's already creating various bits and bobs. 3 Months the original series ran for, from 12 February 1974 until 7 May 1974 . 13  The total number  of episodes made  - but they ended  up being shown on rotation for 26 weeks a year over the next 13 years . 40m Pounds has been contributed to the UK economy so far by merchandise featuring the pink-and-white cat . 15 minutes is the total length of each episode - and the first 2 minutes and  51 seconds of each is identical . We have no immediate plans to make new episodes of Bagpuss, although I'm regularly asked about it. I'm very wary; it's so idiosyncratic, so very much Dad and Peter's creation. But I haven't totally rejected a proposal from an American company. An American company? I can hear shrieks of horror from Bagpuss's millions of loyal British fans. But Americans do understand Bagpuss - make do and mend is a big thing in the States and I can see an old clapboard shop somewhere on the coast of Maine with a large pink-and-white cat presiding, a little sleepily, over all sorts of gently paced, slightly wistful fun. He'd still be baggy and just a bit loose at the seams but the important thing is that Emily would still love him. Because it wouldn't be Bagpuss if she didn't. Happy Birthday Bagpuss, a book of projects to make, is out now from Collins & Brown, Â£11.99.","Bagpuss, the series about a cloth cat, turns 40 this year .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Wearing headphones while cycling is banned in a number of U.S. states, and London’s transport ministers are considering a similar ban in the UK. A 17-year-old student has created a solution that not only mounts an iPhone securely to the handlebars of any bike - it doubles up a speaker. The Allo case lets cyclists listen to music, make calls and use navigation apps completely hands-free, and without obstructing their hearing with earbuds. The Allo, pictured, was invented by teenager Benji Miller. It is powered by two AAA batteries and has an output of up to 90 decibels - the same sound as a train horn, for example, and louder than city traffic. This means navigational instructions and voice calls are audible above everyday road noises . Speaker and case . Height: 7-inches . Width: 6.5-inches . Depth: 1.1-inches . Sound level: up to 90 dB .

Allo is powered by two AAA batteries and has an output of up to 90 decibels - the same sound as a train horn, for example, and louder than city traffic. This means navigational instructions and voice calls will be audible above road noises. Inventor Benji Miller, from Santa Monica in California said: ‘After seeing many people riding while distracted and illegally use their earphones or holding their phones with one hand while biking, I wanted to create a way to be able to access my smartphone easily. The case, pictured, is made from hardened plastic to protect the phone during an accident, and is adjustable meaning it fits on all handlebar sizes and at different angles. Cyclists can buy the Allo from Kickstarter for $40 (£24) and, if Miller achieves funding, the case is expected to retail for $45 (£27) ‘I was surprised to find that there was nothing on the market that did what I was looking for.’ The case is made from hardened plastic to protect the phone during an accident, and is adjustable meaning it fits on all handlebar sizes and can be positioned in different angles. Miller set up a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of the Allo last month and is looking to raise $24,500 (£14,750). The campaign ends on 13 April and Miller has so far raised $14,900 (£9,000). Cyclists can buy the Allo from Kickstarter for $40 (£24) and, if Miller achieves funding, the case is expected to retail for $45 (£27). The basic model comes in white, but there is a limited supply of gold versions available. Miller said he is also working on Allo cases for other models of phones.","Allo is an iPhone case mounted onto the handlebars of any bike .

"By . James  Nye . New security footage released today raises the horrifying possibility that Paul Walker was trapped inside his car for up to a minute before the fireball which engulfed his Porsche Carerra GT took hold. Contradicting previous reports that Walker's car exploded in flames on impact in Santa Clarita on Saturday, the video shows no smoke rising from the wreck in the immediate aftermath of the crash which claimed the Fast & Furious star's life and that of driver, Roger Rodas.

And on Monday Walker's Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel joined crowds who'd gathered to pay their respects. Speaking through a police car loudspeaker, he said: 'If my brother were here right now and saw all the love that you're bringing here. If he could see for himself that all of you have showed up to show my brother love at this hard time. That his family gets to see all of you show the love that you've shown Paul. It's going to stay with me forever. 'I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for coming down here and showing that angel up in heaven how much you appreciate him. It's going to stay with me for ever.' The footage of the deadly crash which claimed the lives of Walker, 40 and driver, Roger Rodas, 38, was released as images of the dramatic moment cops and emergency workers physically wrestled one of the Fast & Furious star's friends away from the scene also came to light. And following the harrowing video and images, a professional driver who was at the charity show in Santa Clarita has come forward to claim that Rodas and Walker took their car out to check for a suspected mechanical issue and not for a joyride as has been claimed. 'As they were backing up the Carrera to put into the garage, it started stalling. I heard someone say, and I think it was Roger, ""Why is the car stalling? Let’s take it around the block"", the unidentified witness told Hollywood Reporter. 'Paul said, ""Let me go with you really quickly"".

"By . Victoria Woollaston . You may be forgiven for thinking this image is a 2D painting but it is, in fact, a 3D computer model of an 1885 Hungarian masterpiece. Graphic designer Zsolt Ekho Farkas created the full 3D rendering using painter Benczur Gyula's battle scene Budavar visszavetele, also known as the Recapture of Budapest. It took a month to digitally map the scene, and a further five weeks to paint and mask the digital model. Scroll down for video . Graphic artist Zsolt Ekho Farkas created the full 3D recreation, pictured, using Hungarian painter Benczur Gyula's Budavar visszavétele, or Buda repossession masterpiece. It began as a challenge from his wife and took a month to model the 32 characters, followed by five weeks spent painting and masking the project . Gyula Benczur was a late 19th century Hungarian painter. He painted the Budavar visszafoglalasa, also known as the Recapture of Budapest, pictured, in 1885 which depicts the siege of the Budapest in 1686. Benczur was renowned for painting portraits of kings and aristocrats . Gyula Benczur was a late 19th century . Hungarian painter. He helped paint the Maximilianeum and Rathaus . frescoes in Munich and commissioned by Bavarian King Ludwig II to paint . Rococo themes. Benczur was renowned for painting portraits of kings and aristocrats. His 1885 painting Budavar visszavetele, also known as the Recapture of Budapest, shows the 1686 siege of Budapest featuring Prince Charles of Lorraine. Farkas said: 'This project started as a funny challenge from my wife, but became something more. 'We were on holiday solving riddles, and there was a medieval painting in the booklet. 'My wife asked me if I could [produce] it in 3D?! I said yes, of course. Farkas began by analysing a high-resolution copy of Benczur's painting he found on Wikipedia, before plotting the positions of each character in 3D on his home computer. He started modelling characters using what’s called a full rig that could be moved and animated, but admitted his PC could only handle these animations for up to nine of the 32 characters. Farkas began by analysing a high-resolution copy of the painting he found on Wikipedia, before plotting the positions of each character in 3D on his home computer, pictured . Using static modelling techniques Farkas plotted each of the characters, pictured, on so-called displacement maps that are used to showcase depth and height. Once all of the characters were plotted, Farkas rendered colours in the images using the digital copy of the painting . Instead, he resorted to detailed, static modelling techniques and plotted each of the characters on so-called displacement maps that are used to showcase depth and height. Once all of the characters were plotted, Farkas rendered colours in the images using the digital copy of the painting. He then had to repaint sections of the characters that were obstructed using a clone stamp tool that copied and transferred colours from other regions of the rendered painting. To create the smoke effect, Farkas filmed footage of smoke using a camera and two LED lights. This footage was uploaded and stills from it were added to the model using a mask layer. The project began as a challenge from Farkas' wife and took the Hungarian graphic designer a month to model the 32 characters. This was then followed by five weeks spent painting and masking the project. The different masks and rendering processes are pictured . Once all of the characters were plotted, pictured, Farkas then had to repaint sections of the characters that were obstructed using a clone stamp tool which copied and transferred colours from other regions . The modelling took a month to complete, while the painting and masking took an extra five weeks. Gyula Benczur was a late 19th century Hungarian painter. He helped paint the Maximilianeum and Rathaus frescoes in Munich and was commissioned by Bavarian King Ludwig II to paint Rococo themes. Benczur was renowned for painting portraits of kings and aristocrats. ‘During the creation I made a few bad decisions, but it was extremely useful and instructive,' added Farkas. ‘Seeing this kind of popularity I decided to make another one now I know the obstacles, and the parts that I have to make differently. 'Maybe a 2.5 D version could look better? But I wanted to make it in full 3D; for my wife, and for myself of course.’ The full step-by-step process can be found on Farkas' blog in Hungarian, and an English version is available from Behance.","3D rendering is based on Benczur Gyula’s painting Budavar visszavetele, also known as the Recapture of Budapest .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A landmark step towards the creation of artificial life has been taken by scientists who have built a functioning synthetic yeast chromosome. Their achievement breaks new ground by taking the emerging field of synthetic biology beyond the limits of bacteria and viruses. The scientists improved upon the design of the yeast chromosome by stripping out ‘junk’ DNA and said the technique can be used to give chromosomes new properties. Scroll down for video . Scientists made 50,000 changes to the DNA code to make the yeast 'III' chromosome tougher and give it new properties. Chromosomes are tiny packages of DNA that contain the genes in which the 'book of life' is written. A sample of the yeast is pictured . Chromosomes are thread-like structures located inside the nucleus of animal and plant cells. Each one is made of protein and a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA, which contains the specific instructions that make each type of living creature unique. Chromosomes vary in number and shape among living things. Most bacteria have one or two circular chromosomes, but humans, along with other animals and plants, have linear chromosomes that are arranged in pairs within the nucleus of the cell. While the research is in its early stages, it could lead to artificial strains of yeast being used in medicine, vaccines and even biofuels. Chromosomes are tiny packages of DNA that contain the genes in which the 'book of life' is written. Previously, scientists have built artificial versions of bacterial chromosomes, as well as viral DNA, but this is the first time the chromosome of a eukaryote - a higher organism whose cells contain nuclei, unlike bacteria - has been created. Unlike genetic engineering, which involves transferring genes from one organism to another, synthetic biology involves designing and then constructing new genetic material from scratch. U.S. synthetic biology pioneer Dr Jef Boeke, Director of the New York University Langone Medical Centre, said: ‘Our research moves the needle in synthetic biology from theory to reality. ‘This work represents the biggest step yet in an international effort to construct the full genome of synthetic yeast.’ Writing in the journal Science, the team describes how the chromosome - dubbed 'synIII' - was constructed and successfully incorporated into brewer's yeast. While the research is in its early stages, it could lead to artificial strains of yeast being used in medicine, vaccines and even biofuels. One company in California has already used synthetic biology to create a strain of yeast that can produce artemisinin, which is an ingredient for an anti-malarial drug. A mosquito is pictured . Scientists removed redundant parts of the 'real' chromosome. This reduced the size of the synthetic chromosome by around 15 per cent. They made further changes to the genetic code to introduce variations in the chromosome different to those in the original one. They then integrated their 'synlll' creation into a living yeast cell and showed that the cells were 'remarkably normal'. The chromosome is the most extensively altered ever made. Dr Boeke said they behave almost identically to wild yeast cells but with their new capabilities they can do things that wild yeast cannot. Britain is involved in the international effort to synthesise 16 yeast chromosomes and last year the government dedicated £1million to the yeast project out of its £60million budget for synthetic biology. The seven-year-long project involved piecing together some 273,871 DNA components. The scientists also tweaked nature's design by removing repeated DNA sections thought to be unnecessary to reproduction and growth. Regions of ‘junk’ DNA that appeared to perform no function were taken out, as well as ‘jumping gene’ segments known to move around randomly and introduce mutations. ‘When you change the genome you're gambling,’ said Dr Boeke. ‘One wrong change can kill the cell. ‘We have made over 50,000 changes to the DNA code in the chromosome and our yeast still alive. That is remarkable. It shows that our synthetic chromosome is hardy, and it endows the yeast with new properties.’ Sixty undergraduate students were recruited to tie together short snippets of the synthetic DNA into stretches 750 to 1,000 units long. It was only in 2010 that Dr Craig Venter created the first synthetic genome for bacteria and this latest research has sparked an on-going international mission to reconstruct the entire yeast genome over the next few years. Yeast chromosome III was chosen for synthesis because it is among the smallest of the 16 yeast chromosomes. It controls how yeast cells ‘mate’ and undergo genetic change. It was only in 2010 that Dr Craig Venter created the first synthetic genome for bacteria and this latest research (Dr Boeke is pictured with a researcher) has sparked an on-going international mission to reconstruct the entire yeast genome over the next few years . Medicine: Scientists could make synthetic chromosomes for yeast cells to speed up the rate of yeast evolution. This means that they could create strains designed for use in certain complex medicines. A company in California has already used synthetic biology to create a strain of yeast that can produce artemisinin, an ingredient for an anti-malarial drug. Biofuels: The scientists said that new types of yeast chromosomes could improve the efficiency of producing biofuels, made in the fermenting process. The organism shares roughly a third of its 6,000 genes - stretches of DNA that encode for proteins - with humans. Large sections of yeast DNA were manipulated by the scientists using a ‘scrambling’ technique that involves shuffling genes like a deck of cards. ‘We can pull together any group of cards, shuffle the order and make millions and millions of different decks, all in one small tube of yeast,’ Dr Boeke added. ‘Now that we can shuffle the genomic deck, it will allow us to ask: Can we make a deck of cards with a better hand for making yeast survive under any of a multitude of conditions, such as tolerating higher alcohol levels.’ The research paves the way to synthetic strains of yeast that could be used in the manufacture of medicines or vaccines. Synthetic yeast could also bolster the development of efficient biofuels, the scientists claim. One company in California has already used synthetic biology to create a strain of yeast that can produce artemisinin, which is an ingredient for an anti-malarial drug, the BBC reported.","This is the first time the chromosome of a higher organism whose cells contain nuclei - unlike bacteria - has been created .

"By . Mark Prigg . Bison hunting could return to Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon, it has been claimed. The Nez Perce tribe once hunted bison in what is now Yellowstone National Park, and some tribal leaders want to revive the practice, which ended with Western settlement and the near total extermination of the once-vast U.S. bison herds. Herds of bison roaming the northern reaches of the Grand Canyon are also causing headaches for park staff as the animals graze in pristine meadows, trample vegetation, damage cliff dwellings and pollute water sources. The Nez Perce tribe once hunted bison in what is now Yellowstone National Park, and some tribal leaders want to revive the practice. Yellowstone, a huge park that covers parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho and in which hunting is illegal, once made up a key segment of the Idaho tribe's traditional hunting grounds, and some Nez Perce leaders say they should again be able to hunt buffalo inside the park. 'Before there was a park, there was a tribe,' Nez Perce Chairman Silas Whitman said. 'Some of our members already feel we have the right to hunt in the park, but it hasn't been exercised because we feel it would be remiss in going forward that way.' After asserting hunting rights tied to historic treaties in recent years, the Nez Perce and three other tribes already hunt those bison that follow ancient migration routes outside the park and into Montana in search of winter range. The Nez Perce have not yet formally requested hunting rights inside the park. Such a request would require extensive federal review, major changes to Yellowstone policies, and congressional action to modify a founding law that banned hunting or killing of buffalo and other wildlife there. Killing of animals that wander into Montana in winter in search of food aims to keep in check a herd population whose size is determined by social tolerance rather than the ecosystem's carrying capacity, Yellowstone officials said. The prospect of hunting any of the 4,000 buffalo within Yellowstone boundaries is strongly opposed by animal advocates, who decry an existing culling program that allows hundreds of bison to be hunted and shipped to slaughter annually. 'Yellowstone is against any proposal to hunt in the park,' said David Hallac, chief of the Yellowstone Center for Resources, the park's science and research branch. Whitman said the tribe would not force the issue by violating any of the park's regulations but may seek to broach the topic with the U.S. Interior Department, which oversees the national park system, or perhaps lobby Congress 'to request those changes be made'. The herds of bison roaming the northern reaches of the Grand Canyon are causing headaches for park staff as the animals graze in pristine meadows, trample vegetation, damage cliff dwellings and pollute water sources. The bison were introduced to northern Arizona in 1906 as part of a ranching operation to crossbreed them with cattle, creating hybrids known as beefalo or cattalo. The state of Arizona owns and maintains the bison outside the national park, but the animals now are making their home almost exclusively within the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park. Federal and state officials are looking at methods to manage the roughly 300 bison in a way that rids them from the park and allows for a free-ranging population that can be hunted on nearby forest land. On Wednesday, they announced a trio of public meetings to be held in southern Utah and Arizona and a scoping period. 'It's the first step in a long process today,' Grand Canyon Superintendent Dave Uberuaga said. The massive animals have reduced vegetation in meadows to nubs, traveled into Mexican spotted owl habitat, knocked over walls at American Indian cliff dwellings below the North Rim, defecated in lakes and left ruts in wetlands at the Grand Canyon . 'We're just trying to get it out there and get it on everybody's radar screens.' The bison no longer look like cattle but still have about 10 percent cattle in their genes. The massive animals have reduced vegetation in meadows to nubs, traveled into Mexican spotted owl habitat, knocked over walls at American Indian cliff dwellings below the North Rim, defecated in lakes and left ruts in wetlands, Uberuaga said. The iconic symbols of the West can weigh more than 2,000 pounds and run three times faster than humans, the agency has said. Management methods likely to be brought up during the public scoping period that ends June 6 include baiting, hazing, fencing, relocating the bison and shooting them. Uberuaga said birth control hasn't proven an effective method for controlling the population. Public meetings are scheduled for April 28 in Kanab, Utah; April 29 in Flagstaff; and April 30 in Phoenix. Arizona became the owner of the hybrid bison in the northern part of the state after a rancher's experiment to produce a robust type of livestock by breeding cattle with bison largely failed. The offspring of the animals purchased by the state in 1925 began walking up the Kaibab Plateau in the late 1990s into the national park, seeking better forage. A bison management plan is expected be issued in the fall of 2016. Management of Yellowstone bison has stirred controversy for decades. Killing of animals that wander into Montana in winter in search of food aims to keep in check a herd population whose size is determined by social tolerance rather than the ecosystem's carrying capacity, Yellowstone officials said. The culling is also designed to ease the worries of Montana ranchers who fear bison will transmit the cattle disease brucellosis, which can cause animals to miscarry, to cows that graze near the park. That could put into jeopardy Montana's brucellosis-free status, which allows ranchers to ship livestock across state lines without testing. Marty Zaluski, Montana state veterinarian and member of a state, federal and tribal team that manages bison in and around Yellowstone, is a proponent of hunting in the park and told Reuters in February it needed to be 'looked at more seriously as a possible solution'. Emerald Pool in Black Sand Basin: Yellowstone, a huge park that covers parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho and in which hunting is illegal, once made up a key segment of the Idaho tribe's traditional hunting grounds . He said it would bring the herd closer to a population target of 3,000 to 3,500 and lessen the public outcry tied to slaughter of wayward buffalo. But Yellowstone's Hallac contends that hunting in the park, which draws 3 million visitors a year because of tourist attractions such as the Old Faithful geyser and the bison, would further complicate matters. 'Even a proposal to hunt in the park causes more problems than the dilemma it intends to solve,' he said. 'These are America's wildlife and a crucial part of our national heritage. 'To propose to hunt in a place established specifically to prevent animals from being hunted is bizarre.'","Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon both considering how to deal with bison population .

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple suppliers around the world are about to crank up their production lines for the big screen set to find its way into the iPhone 6, it has been claimed. Japan Display Inc, Sharp Corp and South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd have all been tapped to make the screens. They will begin mass producing displays as within weeks for the next iPhone, expected to be launched this autumn, with a 4.7-inch screen likely to be produced first while a 5.5-inch version could be delayed. Scroll down for video . Recent concept images by designer Martin Hajek, pictured, and Italian artists Enrico Penello and Ran Avni feature a curved screen with 'bumps' at the top and bottom, along with an illuminated Touch ID sensor used to recognise fingerprints, first introduced on the iPhone 5S . Representatives for the three suppliers and for Apple declined to comment. Both iPhone 6 screens will be larger than the 4.0-inch panels on Apple's existing iPhone 5S and 5C models. Larger iPhones, the subject of months of speculation, would mark yet another incremental tweak to the popular smartphone line and an attempt to catch up to rivals like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. CEO Tim Cook, while promising only 'new product categories' for 2014, has played his cards close to his chest. Apple's shares have languished below $600 since November 2012, in part because of worries about smartphone market saturation and its ability to stay at the forefront of tech innovation. Both iPhone 6 screens are expected to use in-cell touch panel technology - built into the screen and allowing for thinner construction than with standard touch panel films - that was introduced with the iPhone 5, the sources said. But due to difficulties with in-cell production technology for the larger 5.5-inch size, one of the sources said, a decision was made to begin mass production with the 4.7-inch version alone. Production of 5.5-inch screens is expected to start several months later, with the possibility of a shift to a film sensor instead of in-cell technology for that size, the source said. Japan Display will be the first supplier to start production, at its flagship plant at Mobara, east of Tokyo, as early as May, the sources said. The others are due to begin output around June. Images posted to Chinese social network Weibo earlier this week are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at Apple supplier Foxconn.

The images, pictured left and right, were posted on Chinese social network Weibo earlier this week and are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at Apple supplier Foxconn. Although the images are blurry, they appear to show a rounded design and protruding camera, similar to that seen on the iPod touch . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.18mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. By comparison, Appleâ€™s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 7.9mm thick, while the HTC One is 9.3mm. Alternatively, the models shown in the pictures could be the next generation of Apple's MP3 player. Reports are claiming Apple is gearing up to go into mass production of the screen on its next flagship phone as early as next month. The first image shows what appears to be a blueprint of the iPhone 6, while the other two images of prototype models are shown in silver with rounded edges - similar to those seen on last yearâ€™s iPad Air tablet. Speculation is rife that Apple could follow up this super-thin tablet with an equally slim phone, dubbed iPhone Air, and the new images appear to corroborate this. Earlier this month, Japanese magazine MacFan published drawings of what purported to be a 4.7-inch and 5.7-inch iPhone 6C.

The protruding camera and rounded edges of the purported iPhone 6 prototypes are similar to those seen on the current iPod touch model, pictured . The latest mockups come after Taiwanese sources said the camera in the iPhone 6 will get a boost to 10MP megapixels, from its current 8MP version, along with a new lens offering better picture quality. It is also expected to boast a new filter, allowing for clearer pictures. If Apple follows its usual release schedule, the new models will be unveiled in September this year, although experts are expecting the tech giant to launch at least one model in June. Apple's new devices are expected to use the in-cell touch panel technology - which embeds sensors more tightly into the screen - seen on previous models to make the next device as thin as possible. But reports suggest difficulties with this technology in larger displays has caused Apple to delay production of the 5.5-inch versions. Last November, designer Martin Hajek created a concept that demonstrated it was possible to increase the screen size of the iPhone 6, without drastically increasing the size of the handset.

But now there’s an app which lets diners either order ahead and pay for their meal, or settle a bill at the table using a smartphone. This is the first time these services have been available in high-street stores in the UK. PayPal's new in-app features are designed to make life easier for diners.

At the moment the service is restricted to select restaurants but the firm is planning to roll it out to more businesses over the next couple of months. For example, the Order Ahead feature is only available at Wagamama. Diners can order and pay for a takeaway from the noodle bar via the app so that it will be waiting for them to collect. People eating at Prezzo can pay for their meal at their table without having to wait for a waiter to come over, and there is also an in-built option to split the bill with friends.

The company recently found that around three quarters of Britons hate queuing. ‘Our new Order Ahead and Pay at Table services save busy people valuable time. Why wait for the bill when you can pay at the table with your smartphone? And why wait in a restaurant for your takeaway when you can skip the queue by choosing and ordering ahead on your phone?’ he added. Tom Cheesewright, Applied Futurist for . Book of The Future, said: ‘People don't need to add a new app or account . [beyond the standard PayPal app] or move money around in order to take . advantage [of the new features]. ‘The big name brands adopting the technology should accelerate the understanding and ultimately the use of mobile payments on the UK high street.’ PayPal already has the biggest network of high street stores - including Oasis and JD Sports - to let customers pay with their smartphone.

Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: Former Tesco delivery driver Darren Finn captured footage of rats crawling over food and crates at a Tesco distribution centre. He claims he contracted the potentially deadly Weil's disease from bags he carried that he claims were saturated with rat's urine . Infested: Rats can be seen climbing up the crate inside the centre, while others are spotted scurrying between containers . Concerns: Mr Finn, a father-of-two, claims the distribution centre was overrun with vermin . Hospitalised: The 39-year-old fell ill with Weil's disease in November 2012, when he worked as part of Tesco's Harlow Transport Team. Doctors discovered he was suffering kidney and liver failure, and fought to keep him alive . It . took more than a week before he was finally diagnosed with the . potentially life-threatening condition Weil’s disease, by which time he . had grown so ill hospital staff feared he might die. Mr Finn, who lives in Epping, London with his wife and children, believes he contracted the disease while working as a fresh distribution lorry driver for Tesco. The supermarket chain deny the claim, adding they have passed scrupulous Environmental Health inspections. But Mr Finn said the distribution centre was constantly overrun with rats and staff members were not given adequate equipment to safeguard them from illness. He said: 'I have been to hell and back due to this illness. I honestly believed I was going to die when I was in hospital as I was on death’s door - even the doctors were extremely worried. 'Thankfully I managed to pull through but I am not the same as I was before and I doubt I’ll ever be back to what I was before. Problem: Mr Finn said he had been concerned about the sanitation of the company's distribution centers claiming they had consistently attracted a high number of rats due to available food waste .

Mr . Finn had been employed as a delivery driver for Tesco for more than 10 . years and was part of the company’s Harlow Transport Team. Ordeal: Mr Finn has since left Tesco and is now working for DHL . He . said he had been concerned about the sanitation of the company’s . distribution centers claiming they had consistently attracted a high . number of rats due to available food waste. He said: 'The state of the distribution centers is disgusting. There are rats and vermin all over the place, every time we arrive for a night shift you can see them scurrying around as they are attracted to the food. 'When you pick up the bags they are often wet and with so many rats running around I’m sure there is a lot of rat urine. 'The equipment Tesco give us is simply not sufficient, all we have are the overalls and a pair of cloth gloves that soak in all the moisture. They get soaking so if you have a cut or you rub your eye God knows what you’re going to end up with. 'I was one of the unlucky ones and it almost cost me my life.' Mr Finn, who has left Tesco and now works for DHL, instructed law firm Slater & Gordon to pursue a civil action against the supermarket giant. Tesco have denied liability for his illness. 'I decided to take legal action not just because I want them to answer for what they did to me but to also make sure no one else suffers as I have. Other employees are at risk,' Mr Finn said. Tracey Benson, personal injury lawyer with Slater & Gordon, said: 'Darren has suffered a great deal of pain and distress from this condition which could have easily cost him his life. Denial: A spokesman for Tesco said the supermarket does not accept liability for Mr Finn's illness, adding there is 'no evidence to suggest he caught the disease while working for Tesco' Weil's disease - or leptospirosis - is a type of bacterial infection spread by animals. In 90 per cent of cases the disease causes mild flu-like symptoms, including headache, chills and muscle pain. Where the infection takes hold of a patient's body and is more severe, it can be life-threatening causing organ failure and internal bleeding. The disease is spread in water contaminated with the urine of wild animals infected with the leptospira bacteria. Animals known to carry the bacteria include cattle, pigs, dogs and rodents, particularly rats.Transmission of the disease between humans is incredibly rare. In the UK only 44 cases of the disease were reported in England and Wales during 2011. None were fatal. The infection can be treated with a course of antibiotics. 'The pictures and video he has provided has shown there are a high number of rats scavenging in the recycling and food waste his team was tasked with moving yet they were provided with insufficient safety equipment for the job. 'Employers have a responsibility to protect staff and provide them with the correct equipment to enjoy a safe working environment. 'If they fail to provide this they may be liable if an employee suffers injury or ill health.' A Tesco spokesperson said the company deny any liability for Mr Finn's illness. He said: 'We take any health and safety issues at our sites very seriously. 'Following Mr Finn’s original allegation in December 2012, the Harlow site where he was based was thoroughly inspected by Environmental Health officers who found we had robust pest control routines in place.

A South Carolina mother has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for killing her six-week-old daughter with an overdose of morphine delivered through her breast milk. Prosecutors said Stephanie Greene, 39, was a nurse and knew the dangers of taking painkillers while pregnant and breast feeding, but chose to conceal her pregnancy from doctors to keep getting her prescriptions. She lost her nursing license in 2004 for trying to get drugs illegally. However Greene's lawyer said she was only trying to stop debilitating pain from a car crash more than a decade before and relied on her own judgment and medical research on the Internet instead of the advice of doctors. The lawyer said Greene is still overwhelmed with grief from the loss of her child, Alexis Catherine Greene, in 2010. The 20-year sentence was the minimum after a Spartanburg County jury found Greene guilty of homicide by child abuse. She could have faced up to life behind bars. Greene will have to serve 16 years before she is eligible for parole. She said nothing in court today and quietly shuffled out of the courtroom, her hands and feet shackled, after she was sentenced. Her lawyer said she will appeal and it's likely the case will be tied up for years to come. It is the first time in the United States that a woman has been prosecuted for killing her child through a substance transmitted in breast milk. Scroll down for video . Adorable: Alexis Catherine Greene (pictured left and right) was born September 28, 2010,  at Mary Black Memorial Hospital . Tragic: Alexis Catherine Greene was just six-weeks-old when she was found dead in her parents' bed in their Campobello home on November 13, 2010 . Greene's lawyer Rauch Wise said prosecutors didn't prove how the baby got the morphine and there is little scientific evidence that enough morphine can gather in breast milk to kill an infant. 'The court can't punish her any more than she already has been by losing a child,' Wise said. Greene's husband Randall Greene did not talk to reporters. Wise said Randy supported his wife and was devastated as he prepared to raise their seven-year-old son alone. Greene's fourth pregnancy in 2010 was unplanned, but she and her husband of 10 years joyously accepted the surprise, Wise said. She has two children from a previous marriage. Alexis was born healthy, and her mother chose to breast feed. Forty-six days later, on November 13, 2010, Greene called 911 to report her baby was unconscious in her bed. On a recording of the call, she sounds groggy and unfocused. The former nurse first tries to do CPR compressions on the baby's back and has trouble counting to keep pace. Investigators at the scene found dozens of pill bottles and painkiller patches on her nightstand where the couple's then four-year-old son could get to them. A toxicology report from the baby's autopsy found a level of morphine in the child's body that a pathologist testified could have been lethal for an adult, prosecutor Barry Barnette said. Sad: Stephanie Greene's (pictured during a court appearance, date unknown) lawyers say she is still grieving the loss of little Alexis four years since her death . Representation: Stephanie Greene's (right) lawyer Rauch Wise (left) said his client would appeal the 20 year sentence because prosecutors didn't prove how the morphine got into baby Alexis's system . A review of her medical records showed Greene carefully hid her pregnancy from her primary doctor. After a home pregnancy test showed she was pregnant, she told her doctor she needed to go to a gynecologist for a birth control. She then got prenatal care from that doctor while not telling her all the painkillers she was taking, Barnette said. 'She was a nurse. She knew how to work the system,' Barnette said. 'She caused the loss of that child.' But that is an unfair characterization of a woman who remains racked with chronic pain from a 1998 wreck where she fractured her skull and pelvis, Wise said. 'She needed those meds to get up in the morning and function,' Wise said. 'She was on total disability because of her pain, her fibromyalgia and all the other things wrong with her.' Scene: Little Alexis was found dead inside her parents' home at 180 Kimbrell Loop in Campobello, South Carolina (pictured) Greene still faces 38 counts of obtaining prescription drugs through fraud, and Barnette said he is still deciding whether to take those cases to court . Greene had her nursing license suspended in South Carolina in 2004 because she was irrational at work, tried to call in a prescription illegally and refused a drug test, according to an order from the state's Nursing Board. Barnette doesn't want his prosecution to stop women from breastfeeding. He took this case personally because his wife had a miscarriage in 1989. She is a nurse and personally reviewed the case. 'We make sacrifices every day for our children,' Barnette said. 'She decided she was going to have her drugs and sacrifice the health, and ultimately the life, of her child.'

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Following the news Facebook has become the latest firm to enter the drone market, researchers in the UK have successfully created and tested a low-cost craft - built entirely using a 3D printer. Engineers at University of Sheffield developed the prototype 1.5m-wide unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a cheap, common technique that builds objects using layers of plastic. Drones are traditionally built by large manufacturers, due to the cost and complexity involved, and this breakthrough could make the crafts more common place, and even disposable. Scroll down for video . Engineers at Sheffield University have developed a prototype unmanned 1.5m-wide drone, pictured, using a cheap, common 3D printing technique that builds objects using layers of plastic. The craft has already completed a test flight as a glider, pictured . FDM printers use two kinds . of materials - the first is called the ‘modelling material’ and is what . the object is made of. While a second, ‘supporting material’ acts as a scaffolding to support the object during the printing process. The plastic is heated using the printing heads and a controlled heating chamber. During printing, the machine takes designs from a computer drawing and recreates it using layers of the modelling material. As . each layer is printed, it bonds to the previous one. In between each . layer, the modelling heads switch to support heads, which lay down the . second material. This support material can then be washed, or snapped, off the model. FDM is slower than other printing methods, including selective laser sintering (SLS), which uses lasers to fused particles together. However, by not using lasers, it makes the process much cheaper. The UAV completed a test flight as a glider, flown by researchers from the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, earlier this week. The manufacturing cost of the drone has not yet been released, but its researchers have said that it is significantly lower than those of large drone-dedicated companies. In theory it would be possible to build models . similar to the drone at home, on 3D printers such as Maplin's . £700 Kelleman K8200 model. Engineers at the university are now developing an electric fan propulsion system that will make the drone easier to control. They then plan to develop the craft so it can be guided by GPS or camera technology, controlled by an operator wearing first person-view goggles. Sheffield's drone was created for a research project looking at 3D printing of complex designs. It was built using a technique called fused deposition modelling (FDM), and is made of a polymer called thermoplastic. FDM is slower than other printing . methods, including selective laser sintering (SLS), which uses lasers to . fused particles together. However, by not using lasers, it makes . the FDM process much cheaper - although the actual costs depend on the . materials used, the size of the craft and the printer used. Additive manufacture development engineer Mark Cocking said: 'By understanding the capability of the FDM process and associated software, we were able to manipulate the design to contain a number of unique features as well as preventing build deformation. All parts required for the airframe can be combined onto a single build within the Fortus 900 machine, taking less than 24 hours with ABS-M30 material.' Thermoplastics work out at approximately £5.50 ($9) per 2kg bag, although prices vary. Low production costs might lead to the printing of 3D unmanned aircraft that could be disposable and sent on one-way flights for delivery, search or reconnaissance purposes, said the engineers. Dr Garth Nicholson, who led the project, pictured, said the team is working to add an electric fan propulsion to the drone, pictured. It also plans to develop the craft so it can be guided by GPS or camera technology, controlled by an operator wearing first person-view goggles . The craft, pictured, designed by Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMC) was built using a 3D printing technique called fused deposition modelling (FDM). Engineers said the design could form the basis of cheap, and potentially disposable crafts built within 24 hours . FDM printers use two kinds of . materials. The first is called the ‘modelling material’ and is what the . object is ultimately made of once complete. While a second, ‘supporting material’ acts as a scaffolding to support the object during the printing process. The engineers said the polymer craft could be built and deployed in remote situations, potentially within as little as 24 hours. The Sheffield UAV is made up of nine parts printed separately that are snapped together. It weighs less than 2kg (4.4lb) and is made from thermoplastic. The engineers are currently looking at ways to use nylon as the printing material, in place of plastic, which would make the UAV 60 per cent stronger, without increasing its weight. FDM printers use two kinds of materials - the first is called the 'modelling material' and is what the object is made of. While a second, 'supporting material'acts as a scaffolding to support the object during the printing process. During printing, the machine takes designs from a computer drawing, pictured . Dr Garth Nicholson who led the project said: ‘Following successful flight testing, we are working to incorporate blended winglets and twin ducted fan propulsion. ‘We are also investigating full on-board data logging of flight parameters, autonomous operation by GPS, and control by surface morphing technology. ‘Concepts for novel ducted fan designs are also being investigated.’ Mark Zuckerberg revealed yesterday that Facebook is similarly working on drones, satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries. He . has pledged to work on technology to deliver the internet to 'the next 3 . billion people' - and revealed the firm has hired experts in solar . power that can keep drones flying for months at a time. Amazon is also working on developing drones to deliver goods to its customers.","Drone was 3D printed using fused deposition modelling (FDM) technique .

"By . Emma Glanfield . These pictures reveal the latest designs for the next set of luxurious multi-million pound suites planned for the revamped Battersea Power Station. More than £600million of property inside the iconic building has already been sold after phase one, Circus West, was launched earlier this year. Now, developers behind the revamp, Battersea Power Station Development Company (BPSDC), have unveiled the latest designs and prices of the second phase of plush apartments – which are to be put on a ‘London-only’ sale in May. Scroll down for video . Developers behind the revamp of Battersea Power Station have unveiled the latest designs of the plush apartments which will boast 'bold, beautiful and generously-sized' living spaces, pictured . Guide prices for the homes also include one-bedroom apartments from £1 million, two-bed apartments from £1.5 million and three-bedroom homes starting from £2.7 million. A penthouse price is available only on application . Around 254 homes will be released as part of the next stage of redevelopment – with prices for a studio apartment starting from £800,000 and ranging up to £4million for a four bedroom home. Guide prices for the homes also include one-bedroom apartments from £1 million, two-bed apartments from £1.5 million and three-bedroom homes starting from £2.7 million. A penthouse price is available only on application. The old power station, which sits on the banks of the River Thames, has become one of London's best-loved landmarks, with numerous failed attempts to revive the Grade II listed building over the past three decades. It was designed by British architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott who also worked on other well-known structures including Liverpool Cathedral, London’s Waterloo Bridge and Bankside Power Station which has since become the Tate Modern. He also designed the iconic red telephone box before his death in 1960. Since Battersea Power Station ceased generating electricity in the 1980s, development proposals for what is Europe's largest brick building have included a Disneyland, a nightclub, a football club and just about everything in between. Now owned by a consortium of Malaysian investors, the 39-acre site is being completely redeveloped to include a six-acre public park, office space for 5,000 people, around 200 shops and restaurants and leisure and recreation facilities. The new homes will boast ‘bold, beautiful and generously-sized’ living spaces and will fall into two styles across three different locations of the landmark building - The Switch House East, The Switch House West, and Boiler House Square at the top. More than 250 apartments and townhouses built within the iconic Battersea Power Station are set to go on the market in an exclusive 'London-only' sale on May 1 . Since Battersea Power Station ceased generating electricity in the 1980s, development proposals for what is Europe's largest brick building have included a Disneyland, a nightclub, a football club and just about everything in between . A number of apartments will sit in the original fabric of the building, among exposed brickwork and industrial fittings, while other homes, in a ‘panoramic, glazed style’ will be on top of the power station looking out over the River Thames, or back onto the famous Boiler House facade. All of them will have access to more than 1.5 acres of roof top gardens while many will have their own private outdoor space. Boiler House Square will be on top of the tall, central Boiler House between the chimneys with two new storeys built around an open, landscaped garden square with a central skylight, while Switch House East and West will lie on the longer, lateral flanks of the power station. The interiors have been designed by London-based interior designers Michaelis Boyd Architects, who describe the style as ‘refined industrialauthentic, highly tactile and visually dramatic’, and will be around 40% larger than average new build developments in London, according to developers. Rob Tincknell, Battersea Power Station Development Company chief executive, said: ‘This launch is genuinely a once in a lifetime opportunity to own one of a small number of very special bespoke residences that have been meticulously designed to reflect the quality and detailing applied to Giles Gilbert Scott's original masterpiece. A number of apartments will sit in the original fabric of the building, among exposed brickwork and industrial fittings, pictured, while other homes, in a 'panoramic, glazed style' will be on top of the power station looking out over the River Thames, or back onto the famous Boiler House facade . The converted Battersea Power Station will be surrounded by a modern garden area featuring an array of plants and seating areas, pictured, where residents will be able to relax and take in the view of the extensive redevelopment . ‘Being significantly larger than many other comparable new home residences in London and with the best in class design and specification, homes at the Power Station have been designed with a view to attracting owner-occupiers who want to be at the heart of the vibrant community planned for the Power Station.’ The launch of the new properties at Battersea Power Station will be held in London only on May 1 as part of a commitment to prioritise UK buyers. Prospective buyers will have to register their interest and attend allocated sales appointments. The redevelopment of the building will create 15,000 new jobs, 3,500 new homes and a privately-funded extension of the London Underground at Nine Elms and Battersea Power Station. The revamped Power Station will feature 200 shops and restaurants a state-of-the-art performance venue, cinema, six-acre riverside park and a new Underground tube station, which will connect to the Northern line . More than £600million of property inside the iconic building has already been sold after phase one, Circus West, was launched earlier this year. Preparatory work on the site began in 2012, and the first properties are expected to be completed by 2016 . Construction work on the site will begin in the summer and will see the removal and individual rebuilding of the four iconic white chimneys of the Grade-II building, to avoid their possible collapse. Preparatory work on the site began in 2012, and the first properties are expected to be completed by 2016. The former power station is considered a prime example of 1930s Art Deco architecture and was made famous on the cover of Pink Floyd’s Animals album.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . The Little Couple's Jen Arnold has spoken frankly of little Zoey's integration into her new family, in an exclusive sneak preview of tonight's episode on TLC. 'Life has definitely changed a lot since bringing Zoey home from India,' the 39-year-old mother of two revealed, speaking touchingly about the toddler's transformation from 'a very frightened little girl' to a 'bright eyed, happy so well-adjusted two-year-old.' In the clip, the family are shown in high spirits enjoying a dinner together; a happy scene which is a far cry from many of the show's recent episodes. Transformed: After a rough start, two-year-old Zoey is adjusting well to life with the Little Couple's family . 'Will and Zoey, like many kids who come from orphanages, are somewhat fixated on food,' Mrs Arnold explains in the preview. 'We feel often times like it is a race to get food on the table!' At one point, the two children are encouraged to pray before starting their meal. Will clasps his little hands together in a willing gesture while Zoey waves her fork around animatedly. Despite the all-round smiles, it hasn't been an easy ride for the family of late. The neonatologist and reality TV star mother - who, with her husband Bill Klein, as well as both children, has a type of dwarfism called skeletal dysplasia - was diagnosed with choriocarcinoma last year, a rare form of uterine cancer. Family affair: The clip shows son Will (far left), Mom Jen (center left), Dad Bill (center right) and Zoey (far right) enjoying a happy meal together . She revealed on a previous episode that transitioning Zoey into the family whilst undergoing six rounds of chemotherapy was extremely difficult. 'In my darkest moments, I couldn't get out of bed,' she confessed. The couple welcomed Zoey into their home in Houston, Texas last year, and the toddler - who was raised from infancy in an orphanage - had a difficult time adjusting to life in America. According to the couple, for weeks, Zoey would have temper tantrums where she would throw herself on the ground and cry uncontrollably. Adorable: Mrs Arnold revealed that, like many kids who come from orphanages, both Will and Zoey are 'somewhat fixated on food' Opening up: Mrs Arnold discusses just how difficult it was trying to transition Zoey into the family while undergoing six rounds of chemotherapy . Happily, the feisty child appears to be in much better spirits in the preview for tonight's show. In another clip, obtained by People Magazine, Mrs Arnold is shown happily playing a game of make believe with her two children. Using a toy medical kit, the three take part in the 'fun weekend activity', which Mrs Arnold explains is to help little Zoey prepare for a check-up at the doctors the following day. Traumatic start: Jen, pictured holding Zoey for the first time last year, says the child had temper tantrums and uncontrollable crying fits when she first came home from her orphanage in India . Beaming: Little Zoey, who, like her parents, has dwarfism, looks full of joy in TLC's latest clip . In the clip from the upcoming episode, she also speaks of how Will, 3, who she adopted from China, also last year, is dealing with his mother's slow recovery from cancer, describing the toddler as 'sensitive' and 'smart'. 'Will doesn't miss a beat and I guess the fact that he now understands mommy's sick, it's touching,' she said. Mrs Arnold received her devastating cancer verdict soon after the couple won their year-and-a-half battle to adopt young Zoey from India, and although the news broke last year, her reaction to the news was first shown on the latest episode of the show. United front: In spite of all their struggles, the strong couple say they are 'blown away' by their daughter's progress . Mrs Arnold described the ‘rapidly growing’ tumor in her uterus as having metastasized into ‘three nodules’ in her lungs. Determined not to let her diagnosis interfere with the adoption of her daughter, eleven months old at the time, she said: ‘That’s what’s getting me through this cancer diagnosis is getting Zoey home and acclimated and continuing to watch Will grow.’ Thankfully, Zoey is now responding positively; these days, the little one 'loves to give kisses' and play with her older brother, who affectionately calls her 'Oh Zoey'. Despite the rough start, her proud parents couldn't be happier. 'We're blown away by the progress she's made,' said Mrs Arnold.",Adopted from India last year amid distressing scenes of her struggle to adapt to new life in America .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A 77-acre plot of land deemed the most expensive field in Britain has been put on the market – for a staggering £30million. The patch of land, nestled in the heart of the countryside, is set to become the foundations of a 33,000 sq. ft ten-bedroom mansion which will come complete with an indoor swimming pool and spa. It is thought the estate, situated near . Windsor Great Park, will be worth £100million once completed – making it . the most expensive private home outside of London and potentially netting the owner a £50million profit. The plot of land, the boundary of which is highlighted above, is on the market for £30million making it the most expensive plot on sale in Britain . The extensive 77-acre site, the boundary of which is highlighted by the red line, stretches far and wide and is near to Windsor Great Park and Ascot . An artist's impression of the £15million mansion which is proposed for the site. Planning permission has already been granted for the ten-bedroom home which could come with an indoor swimming pool and spa . The proposed £15million property, which . would be 30 times the size of an average new home, is set to come . complete with an indoor swimming pool, spa, cinema, library and . accommodation for staff. Its neighbours include Elton John and The Queen and it is rumoured the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had previously expressed interest in the estate. The plot of land, which includes a picturesque lake, woodland and formal gardens, was bought by Candy & Candy in 2007, who obtained planning permission for a mansion. It was then sold to its current, private owner. However, they have now decided to put the site on the market with joint agents Beauchamp Estates and Grosvenor Billingshurst. Parts of the site, which is only 23 miles from London, have fallen into disrepair over the years and there are currently several derelict buildings across the estate. However, planning permission has already been sought and granted by Runnymede Council to demolish the main Parkwood building, three estate cottages, a pool building and ancillary estate buildings. The 77-acre plot of land, pictured, has been put up for sale for a whopping £30million and has already had planning permission accepted for a £15million mansion - an artist's impression of which is pictured centre left . Parkwood Estate, shown on the map, is only five miles from Ascot, 11 miles from Heathrow and 23 miles from London . The authority has also accepted plans to build the £15million mansion, which will become the main dwelling on the estate, as well as two independently-owned gate houses and an access bridge. Gary Hersham, boss of Beauchamp Estates, said: ‘This is a unique opportunity to acquire a prime Surrey country estate and create a bespoke stately home of outstanding luxury and quality. ‘The completed residence could be worth up to £100million, effectively trebling the value of the estate. Parkwood Estate - included in the land which has been put on the market for £30million - also features a picturesque lake, woodland and formal gardens. An artist's impression, pictured, of how the site could look . ‘For a discerning buyer this is an outstanding lifestyle and investment opportunity with the potential for huge capital value uplift.’ Whoever buys the land will have to knock down the current derelict house on the estate before building the proposed mansion in its place. Ian Davies, Director, Grosvenor Billinghurst, said: ‘This is an utterly extraordinary proposition combining such acreage and an exceptional planning permission. ‘These factors combine to make this one of the most exciting real estate opportunities in the Home Counties in the last ten years. ‘The Parkwood Estate has the potential to become Surrey's most outstanding, luxurious and valuable country house estate.’ An artist's impression of the proposed £15million mansion set in the heart of Parkwood Estate.

Parkwood Estate first came into . prominence at the height of the Victorian era when a late 19th Century . mansion was built on the land. For . most of its life, the estate was owned by Australian entrepreneur Clive . Baillieu, also known as the First Baron Ballieu of Sefton.

"By . Alex Greig . Florida police have arrested a bouncer involved in a violent brawl more than a week ago outside a Fort Lauderdale beach bar, after a cell phone video of the fight went viral. Arnald Thomas-Darrah, 30, was charged with felony battery yesterday for his part in the July 28 clash, and another bouncer, Jovan Ralfhel Dean, 35, will be charged with misdemeanor battery. The 15-second video of the fracas shows victim Alex Coelho, 29, standing outside Dirty Blondes Sports Bar on North Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard before being brutally assaulted by Thomas-Darrah. Another man, David Parker, 27, was also assaulted by Dean. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Violent brawl: Alex Coelho (left) was beaten viciously by bouncer Arnald Thomas-Darrah (right) When police arrived on the scene, however, it was Coelho and Parker who were arrested. According to a police report, Coelho and some friends had arrived at the bar but were escorted from the premises after getting into a verbal altercation with a bartender. Outside, Coelho was demanding to speak to Dirty Blondes' manager when the fight occurred. Coehlo's arrest report states that Coelho and Parker were bleeding and screaming at Dirty Blondes' staff. The report says Coelho refused orders to stop yelling and making physical threats to bar employees. Officer Marc Decarlo claims that Coelho approached him and 'pushed and shoved this officer in the chest.' The calm before the storm: Coelho (black tank top) stands with his girlfriend, reportedly asking to speak to the manager of Dirty Blondes . It's on: Suddenly, Thomas-Darrah has knocked Coelho out of his girlfriends arms . Coelho was charged with battery on a . police officer and disorderly conduct while Parker was charged with . disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. Coelho was taken to Broward Health Medical Center and needed six stitches over his right eye and several over his left eye, the police report said. On the ground: Coelho lies on the ground as Thomas-Darrah lays into him and behind them, Jovan punches Parker . Violent: Coelho tries to protect his head as Thomas-Darrah stomps on him from above . The cell phone video shows Coelho standing outside the bar with his arms around his girlfriend surrounded by at least three men wearing black shirts with 'Security' written on the back. In the next moment, Thomas-Darrah is punching Coelho without apparent provocation. When Coelho falls to the ground, Thomas-Darrah stomps on his head. As Coelho flees, bent double and clutching his head, Thomas-Darrah can be heard to call, 'Have a nice day!' The owner of Dirty Blondes told NBC 6 that Coelho and his friends were kicked out of the bar for arguing with a bartender about the amount of alcohol in their drinks. A.J. Yaari told the Sun-Sentinal that he had reviewed the video and it doesn't tell the whole story. 'It looks like it was a bunch of troublemakers who came to the bar drunk causing trouble,' he said. 'Now, they are just trying to make us look bad.' Friends of . Coelho told the Broward Times that Coelho and Parker are 'both nice and not . the type of kids to start problems with bouncers.' Injured: After fleeing the scene, Coelho and Parker returned to tell police their side of the story and were arrested . After the brawl, the cell phone video was posted to Instagram on July 28 and quickly spread. Victim: David Parker was arrested after bouncers beat him and Alex Coelho outside a Fort Lauderdale bar . A Facebook page called 'Boycott Dirty Blondes' sprang up, where Mary Ann Crespo, a friend of Coelho and his girlfriend, posted a markedly different story to the one given by Dirty Blondes management (edited). 'This is a video of my friend Stephanie and her boyfriend, Alex. They . were at Blondies yesterday, got a drink they didn't like, asked for a . new one (offering to pay for both) and then got verbally attacked by . the bartender. When they asked the security guys at the door for the . manager, this is what happened!' she wrote alongside a posting of the video. Yesterday, outraged friends and supporters of Coelho and Parker staged a protest outside Dirty Blondes. 'I watched the video time and time again and I'm absolutely beside myself every time I see it,' 'I'm here to today to support the cause of having a little bit more screening and control over our security - people that are supposed to be securing us and not assaulting us when we are out on the town,' a protestor named Justin told NBC 6. 'This isn't an isolated incident, it's just one that happened to catch wind. There's a lot of people coming out and saying things like this have happened.' 'Dirty bouncers': Protesters stood outside Dirty Blondes Sports Bar yesterday calling for a boycott of the venue . After such loud and public outcry, yesterday Fort Lauderdale police made this statement: . 'The Fort Lauderdale Police Department is aware of the short clip that has been circulating via YouTube and social media, and we are looking into the details surrounding this incident.'At this time there have been no reports filed with this agency depicting the incident that was captured on this video. The agency encourages both of the individuals arrested to come forward and file police reports regarding the altercation that took place prior to our arrival on scene. 'Incidents received by this agency will be given the professional and thorough attention that is deemed necessary.' On Friday, almost a week after the event, Coelho entered a full report of the incident at a Fort Lauderdale police station and positively identified the bouncers involved. On Sunday, police traveled to the Oakland Park residence of Thomas-Darrah and arrested him. Charges against Dean are pending.","A bouncer has been arrested for his part in a violent brawl outside Dirty Blondes bar in Fort Lauderdale .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A secret underground emergency Cold War bunker sold at auction today for £140,000, nearly three times the asking price. The bunker, which was constructed in Coswarth in Cornwall at the height of the Cold War, was built so experts at the then South West Water Authority would be able to maintain water and sewerage operations during a nuclear emergency. The 3,000 square foot bunker, built in 1978 to house 17 people - seven in the operations room, six in the communications room and three in the control room, had a guide price of £50,000. Cold War: The bunker, which was built in 1978, was designed so experts at the then South West Water Authority would be able to maintain water and sewerage operations during a nuclear emergency . Discrete: The rooms themselves are all deep underground, with the only hint of life below the surface being a small brick entrance building . The bunker's features include several blast-proof doors, an air lock, a decontamination room, a dining room, a recreation room and two dormitories. The rooms themselves are all deep . underground, with the only hint of life below the surface being a small . brick entrance building. Brian Blake, South West Water's asset performance manager, worked for the Authority at the time and can recall visiting the bunker as it was being prepared for potential habitation. 'I remember that the Government said we had to provide an underground control centre in case of emergency which was bomb and nuclear proof,' he said. 'It wasn't fully kitted out as there was no furniture in there, but if something had happened you could have lived in there for weeks.' Chris Shapland, the Authority's . property manager, added: 'We regularly auction redundant assets to . reduce our costs and keep customers' bills as low as possible, but this . is the first time we've offered a genuine piece of Cold War history.' 'Novelty . sites with small areas of surplus land always attract strong interest . as people are able to invest relatively modest sums for their 'little . bit of England',' he added. Mr . Shapland said several of the Authority's former storage reservoirs and . pumping stations have already been converted by their new owners into . unusual homes. The new owner of this bunker has chosen to remain anonymous.

The bunker and adjacent land eventually sold for £140,000, nearly three times the asking price . The purchase may come in handy for the . owner as tensions between the West and Russia reach their most extreme . point since the cold war, with Putin expelled from of the G8 today. Earlier, Western leaders from the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan met in The Hague as the G7 for the first time since Russian was brought into the group in 1998. David Cameron has also announced that the June G8 meeting scheduled to take place in Sochi, the Black Sea town where the Winter Olympics was held, will not take place. America and the EU have been tightening the diplomatic noose around Russia since it occupied and then annexed the Ukranian province of Crimea following a revolution in the country. Asset freezes and visa bans have already been issued against a handful of Russian officials blamed for instigating the crisis, and leaders have warned of further economic sanctions and political isolation should Russian aggression continue. It has been reported by American observers today that Russia has 30,000 troops poised on Ukraine's eastern border, raising fears of further land-grabs in the mostly Russian-speaking east of the country.","Bunker built in Coswarth, Cornwall in 1978, at the height of the Cold War .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . If you have a spare £1.8 million and you want to snap up the perfect home you have two options: a three-bedroom house in Britain's most expensive area or 25 of the same size in Scotland. A survey which compares house prices in 376 councils across the UK has ranked Kensington and Chelsea - where a three-bedroom home sells for £1.8 on average - as the most expensive place to live in the UK. Travel 400 miles north to East Ayrshire and you can buy a similar sized property for just £72,500. Mapped: The price of an average three-bedroom house across Britain and the combined salary a family would need to pay for the house in red . The average house price in the UK reached £250,000 last month - more than three times the cost of the average East Ayrshire home. The survey, reported in The Telegraph, was carried out by property analysts Hometrack. The company found that property prices in cities in the north such as Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham are at least five times cheaper than a house located on one of London's most expensive streets. Liverpool took the title of most affordable city in Britain to buy property. The average price of a three-bedroom house in the northern city is £82,000. After East Ayrshire, the second cheapest area was in Falkirk, Scotland, where a three-bedroom home costs £78,000. Third on the list was Blaenau Gwent, in Wales where the cost of the same house would come to £80,000. Pictured: Houses in Kensington and Chelsea, Britain's most expensive place to buy a three-bedroom home. The average price of a home in one of London's smartest boroughs is £1.8 million . East Ayrshire in Scotland is the cheapest place in the country to buy a three-bedroom home. At 72,500, you could buy 25 houses for the same price as one home in Kensington and Chelsea . Hometrack also compiled a top 20 list of the most expensive property areas. It found that 17 of the 20 areas with the highest price tags were within London. Two of the other hot spots were in Surrey. The areas were: Elmbridge, which includes the towns of Esher, Walton-on-Thames and Weybridge; and Mole . Valley, which covers Dorking and Leatherhead. The third was St Albans in . Hertfordshire. In the three hot spot areas outside of London, a three-bedroom house cost between . £403,750 and £450,000. To afford the mortgage, an annual household income would need to be between . £103,677 and £115,553.

In London, boroughs such as Camden and . Hammersmith are prohibitive for middle class professionals because they . are priced out of the market by wealthier buyers and cash-rich . foreigners. Property giant Savills estimates that a third of property resale in prime locations involve foreign buyers. In Camden, a family would need to earn a combined sum of £225,329 to buy a mid-range £877,500 family home. In Hammersmith, family earnings needed to buy a £829,695 home would total £213,036. In addition to the property prices, experts also analysed the home owners' houses in the 376 councils. They found that, to pay off a mortgage on . a three-bedroom property in Kensington and Chelsea a family would need . to earn a pre-tax income of £462,214. In East Ayrshire, a household . salary would need to come to just £18,617. In a staggering 20 areas across the UK, to buy a three-bedroom property a family income would have to exceed £100,000.Places on the list include: St Alban's, Camden, and Westminster. St Albans is one of the most expensive places in the country to buy a property - outside of London. The average three-bedroom house costs £415,000 . You can buy a three-bedroom house in Oxford for £292,500. Pictured here is a row of colourfully-painted houses on an Oxford street . In addition to the property prices, experts also analysed the home owners' houses in the 376 councils. They . found that, to pay off a mortgage on a three-bedroom property in .

In a staggering 20 areas across the UK, to buy a three-bedroom property a family income would have to exceed £100,000. Places on the list include: St Alban's, Camden, and Westminster. And . although the national average income in the UK is £28,200, in 352 areas . a family's salary would have to exceed that sum if they wanted to . purchase a three-bedroom house. To calculate a family's salary, the analysts looked at the median price for a three-bedroom house in 376 council areas. They then worked out how much buyers would have to spend if they took out a 90 per cent repayment mortgage at four percent, over 25 years. The survey worked on the assumption that a family could afford to spend 30 per cent of their income on the mortgage. Richard Donnell from Hometrack told The Telegraph that the London market was 'driven by . cash purchases and interest-only mortgages, which aren’t available to . everyone'. He said that some couples buying prices down the property ladder might be put off by buying property because of the debt involved.","Average house in London's Kensington and Chelsea costs £1.8 million .

The property has gone on the market at £5.5million with a 43-year lease. There is the option to purchase the flat with an extended lease of 120 years, but that will set the new owner back an extra £1.3million . Despite the flat's stunning, spacious living area, its main selling point is the ground-floor ballroom, rebuilt when the block was constructed in 1958 . Hiring a ballroom in Mayfair, would typically cost from £7,000 to £10,000 for a day or evening. But use of the ballroom at 17 Grosvenor Square is thrown in free of charge as part of the deal - potentially saving a socialite who loves entertaining the rich and famous thousands of pounds a year . 17 Grosvenor Square dates back to the 17th century, but parts were rebuilt after it suffered damage when the area was bombed during the Second World War . The property, which boasts two luxury bathrooms, is valued at more than ten times the average London home and 30 times more than a typical home sold in England and Wales . The stunning flat has gone on the market with estate agent's Wetherell . Peter Wetherell, managing director of Wetherell said: 'This spacious apartment is perfect for a socialite wanting space for entertaining and staff. Its not often that you can buy a Mayfair home with access to a 350 person ballroom and maid¿s rooms' There is a 24-hour porter while parking and maids rooms can be rented separately . The apartment is situated on the second floor of the stunning block which enjoys views over Grosvenor Square, a short walk from Bond Street and Hyde Park . While the current owners live in the flat as a two-bedroom property, the dining room (pictured) can be transformed into a third . American presidents, diplomats, earls, aristocrats and MPs may all have graced the dancefloor of 17 Grosvenor Square in its grand history. The house was originally constructed during the 1720s, as vast mansions were built to create the square. The square, which takes its name from the Duke of Westminster's surname, was the vision of Sir Richard Grosvenor. He obtained licences to start building in 1710, with the first of the opulent buildings taking shape in around 1721. It became one of the most fashionable addresses in London with the early houses boasting five or seven bay windows across three storeys. Like many of its neighbouring houses, No. 17 was rebuilt in the 18th and 19th centuries. Under the ownership of Lord Courtenay, the Earl of Devon the house gained dining rooms, drawing rooms, a large dressing room as well as extensive housing for maids and servants downstairs. It boasted a lavish interior with crimson curtains, Turkish carpets and leather-seated chairs, mahogany furniture as well as busts and bronzes dotting the hallways. In 1846 the lease was bought by Sir James Weir Hogg MP, the chairman of the East India Company. He made radical alterations to the house under the guidance of the architect Thomas Hopper. half of the house was destroyed by bombing in 1940, and it was demolished in 1943. Chimney pieces and other original features were salvaged for preservation and were eventually reassembled after the war. The garden which lies at the heart of Grosvenor Square was once reserved for the use of residents, but is now a public park. At one end there lies a small memorial dedicated to the British victims of the September 11 attacks. Grosvenor Square has been the traditional home of the official American presence in London since 1785, when one of the country's FOunding Fathers John Adams, the second president and first vice president of the U.S. set up the first mission to the Court of St James's. He lived in the house which stands on the coroner of Brook and Duke streets from 1785 to 1788. During the Second World War president DWight Eisenhower located the U.S. military headquarters at 20 Grosvenor Square. The building was used by the U.S. Navy as its European headquarters until 2009. The American embassy as been based in the square since 1938, but will soon relocate to Nine Elms in the borough of Wandsworth, south of the River Thames when the new building is completed in 2016. Standing in the square today are two statues honouring Presidents Roosevelt and Eisenhower.","The flat at 17 Grosvenor Square has gone on the market with a price tag of £5.5million .

"By . Leon Watson . A disgraced tycoon is the mystery buyer who snapped up Beckingham Palace for £11.5 million, it emerged today. Multi-millionaire insurance mogul Neil Utley, 52, moved into David and Victoria's sprawling Hertfordshire home last month. Mr Utley, the chairman of Hastings Direct, also picked up an Aston Martin and two Jaguars as part of the deal. Sold! The Beckhams reportedly sold Beckingham Palace, pictured, for £11.5million - a tidy £9million profit . Posh and Becks are believed to have pooled . the cash from the property as well as from the sale of a number of . their luxury cars, to buy a £45 million mansion in central London. Last . year Mr Utley was forced to pay £130,000 in tribunal costs and banned . from working in the Lloyds market for two years after admitting 'detrimental' conduct during his time at Equity Red Star. It stemmed from his alleged failure to take reasonable steps to ensure that there were sufficient financial systems and controls over personal injury claims. Mr Utley stepped down as chief executive of IAG UK, Equity’s parent company, by 'mutual consent' in July 2010. The Beckhams bought the 12-acre estate in 1999 just three months after their wedding. Their children Brooklyn, 14, Romeo, 11, and Cruz, eight, called it home for a few years before their move to Spain then Los Angeles because of their father's footballing career. The property comes with a second ­house nicknamed mini-Beckingham Palace, The Sunday People reported. Twelve acres of memories: The estate shortly after the Beckhams moved in 15 years ago.

"By . Becky Barrow . Controversy: Around 37,300 homeowners have lost £7,000 each over the last two years due to the stamp duty . Families selling their homes have lost around £260million over the last two years as a result of Britain’s stamp duty ‘dead zones’, a report revealed yesterday. The research, from the property website Zoopla, blames the stamp duty thresholds for forcing homeowners to sell their properties for less than they are actually worth. Stamp duty is charged at 1 per cent on properties between £125,000 and £250,000, 3 per cent up to £500,000 with rates continuing to rise to a maximum of 7 per cent on homes over £2million. It estimates around 37,300 homeowners, whose property is worth a figure which is just above one of the thresholds, have lost an average of £7,000 each over the last two years. As a result, homeowners trapped in the so-called ‘dead zone’ are under-pricing their properties to make them more attractive to buyers. The biggest problem surrounds the £250,000 threshold. If you sell your home for £250,000, the buyer pays a stamp duty bill of £2,500. If you sell it for £250,001, the buyer pays £7,500. For example, there were 46,875 sales between £246,000 and £250,000 over the last two years, but only 15,981 for properties sold for between £251,000 and £265,000. Overall, Zoopla estimates homeowners in England and Wales have lost a total of £260.5million over the last two years. The report comes amid growing pressure for the Chancellor to do something to address the stamp duty problem in tomorrow’s Budget which experts warns distorts the country’s property market. Last week, the Institute of Economic Affairs slammed stamp duty as ‘a bad tax’ which should be ‘abolished’ by the Chancellor, or ‘at the very least’ overhauled. Both the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Council of Mortgage Lenders think the crude thresholds should be replaced a system similar to the income tax regime. The report comes amid growing pressure on Osborne to address the issue in tomorrow's Budget . Lawrence Hall, from Zoopla, whose shareholders include dmg media, a division of the Daily Mail & General Trust, said: ‘The current stamp duty system distorts the market. ‘It prevents thousands of sellers from achieving the full value of their property when they come to sell.’ The estate agency Haart yesterday called for a system which would allow a homeowner to cut their stamp duty bill when they sell one home to buy another one. Under its radical proposal, a family could deduct the value of the stamp duty paid by the buyer of their home from the tax bill they must pay on their next home. The move would particularly help ‘second steppers’, such as families needing to buy a larger home for their growing family. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘We keep all taxes under review. However, there are no plans to reform the stamp duty system.’","Report blames 'dead zones' for hiking stamp duties at low thresholds .

"By . Ray Massey . Concerns: The firm said nearly 7,500 Toyota Versos built in a Turkish factory did not have their wheels screwed on correctly . Toyota is recalling 870 of its cars in the UK over fears the steering-wheel could come off in the driver’s hands after the nut which keeps it in place works loose. It is part of a global recall affecting nearly 7,500 Verso models worldwide built between May and August of last year at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Turkey. The Japanese car-maker said the nut securing the wheel was not correctly tightened during manufacture - which could lead to a loss of steering control. A Toyota spokeswoman said that over time there was a risk of the nut becoming ‘fully detached’, which in turn could lead to the steering wheel coming off in the driver’s hands. But so far there had been no reported accidents or incidents. She said: ‘Toyota has identified the risk of the nut which retains the steering wheel coming loose due to not having been secured with sufficient torque during the assembly process. ‘The problem may result in the steering making an abnormal noise, with the driver experiencing a degree of free play in the wheel. Over time there may be a risk of the nut becoming fully detached.’ She added: ‘All the vehicles affected by this issue are being recalled so that the steering wheel nut can be tightened with the correct degree of torque.” The recall is global and affects 7,414 worldwide of 870 UK-registered Verso cars. It comes less than a month after the firm recalled 1.9million of its top-selling ‘green’ Prius hybrid cars - including nearly 31,000 in the UK - because of a software fault affecting the accelerator-control that could cause the vehicle to shut itself down and stop. Both are the latest in a long line of embarrassing incidents which have beset the firm in recent years causing international controversy, prompting apologies from Japanese bosses, and denting its reputation. Toyota, which is Japan’s biggest carmaker, will check the vehicles and, if necessary, tighten the steering wheel securing nut. Toyota has contacted owners over the last few weeks by post or telephone, asking them to make an appointment to bring their car to their nearest Toyota centre, in accordance with Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) guidelines. The nut retightening takes about 20 minutes to complete and will be carried out free of charge. There are 870 UK-registered models that are in danger of losing their wheel completely because of the fault . Owners have been contacted and urged to make an appointment as soon as possible to have it tightened . Customers can check whether their vehicle is affected using a registration look-up function in the owners section of the main Toyota website. If owners need more information, or do not have access to the internet, they can contact Toyota Customer Relations on 0800 1388744 or 01737 367600. Last month Toyota recalled 30,970 of the current third generation petrol-electric hybrid ‘green’ Prius models registered in the UK and manufactured between March 2009 and February 2014. It was part of a 1.9million recall of Prius models worldwide. It said the latest incident involved an issue with the software used in the ‘boost converter’ which helps control the flow of power. The boost converter is required when accelerating hard from standstill. The embarrassing revelation comes just a month after 30,970 UK Toyota Prius models - 1.9million worldwide - were recalled because of an issue with the boost converter which controls the power . It said there had been 11 incidents across Europe of the computer problem but there had been ‘no accidents or injuries.’ The company said the software defect could lead to key electrical transistor parts ‘deforming or being damaged’. It noted: ‘Should this happen, warning lights may be illuminated and the car is likely to switch to ‘failsafe’ operation. It can still be driven, but with reduced power. In limited cases the hybrid system may shut down, causing the vehicle to stop. The driver will not experience any change in the vehicle’s behaviour or performance prior to the problem occurring.’","Part of global recall affecting nearly 7,500 Verso models built in Turkey .

"By . Richard Spillett . A mother was left furious after she was given a parking ticket for leaving her car outside her own home. Clare Hopkins, 50, was charged £70 for parking her BMW 520 on the grass verge outside her family's house in Waltham, Lincolnshire, after pulling up and dashing inside to avoid a hailstorm on Sunday. Just two minutes after she walked through the door, a neighbour called to tell her that a parking warden had appeared and slapped a ticket on her car. Clare Hopkins says she parked one wheel of her car on the verge in front of her driveway and was given a parking ticket within two minutes . Mrs Hopkins, a fish-factory worker, said: 'I have never known anything like it. I'd been away to visit my mother in Wales and as I got closer to home, a huge hailstorm started. 'I pulled up quickly - off the road - with the full intention of going back out when the hail stopped and parking the car on the drive. 'The most ridiculous thing is that my husband is usually so fussy when it comes to the cars being on the drive, but he'd had to pull his van forward to get the bins out so there wasn't any room for my car.' Despite informing the traffic warden that she had actually parked in front of her own home, he wouldn't revoke the ticket, leaving Mrs Hopkins facing a fine. North East Lincolnshire Council is enforcing verge and footway parking using an experimental Traffic Regulation Order - which they claim Mrs Hopkins infringed. Her £30,000 car was parked partly on the road, with one wheel on the tarmac that leads from the road to the driveway of her family's suburban semi-detached home. Mrs Hopkins has paid the £70 fine to avoid the long appeals process, but says she would have happily moved the vehicle if the warden had knocked on her front door . The mother-of-two says she planned to move the car on to her driveway after sheltering indoors from a hailstorm . She said: 'It was a bit over zealous - it was quite clearly my car in front of my house so I don't know why he couldn't have knocked on the door and asked me to move it. 'There was plenty of room for any wheelchair, pushchair or pedestrian to get by no problem, and I wasn't blocking any cars from using the road. 'When the bins are out each week, they block the path but they don't do anything about it then, and at school pick up and drop off times, you can't move for abandoned cars - but they come picking on me on a quiet Sunday afternoon.' Traffic Regulation Order's allow local authorities to bring in temporary or permanent traffic controls on their roads. Experimental orders, like that Mrs Hopkins fell foul to, usually last up to 18 months. The law states they can be used to 'avoid danger to persons or traffic', 'facilitate the passage of traffic' or 'preserve the character of a road'. Councils have to publish plans before bringing them in and listen to any objections from local residents. Councillor Ray Oxby said: 'In Waltham, a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) may be served where a vehicle is found to be parked in contravention of the terms of the Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). 'Specifically, the TRO is aimed at protecting the footways and grass verges. Contravention code 62 may be used, which is for being parked with one or more wheels on any part of an urban road other than a carriageway. 'If a motorist feels that they have been issued a PCN incorrectly, they should informally challenge their notice. 'This information is also provided on the reverse of the PCN, where full details of how to challenge the Penalty Charge Notice are clearly given.' Mrs Hopkins and her husband Keith, 45, who have two children, have since paid the penalty charge. Mr Hopkins, an HGV driver, said: 'We can't be bothered to appeal it because it just turns into a long process where they get their way. 'They would come back with some answer you can't get around. When you can't even park outside your own home, it just makes you think what next?'","Clare Hopkins left a wheel of her car in front of her driveway in a hailstorm .

"By . Rob Waugh . It gets into your blood, consuming your thoughts and inducing panic attacks if the next fix is not in sight. On a good day, it might offer a harmless escape from the troubles of the world. But on a bad, it can turn into a monstrous distraction, rendering you unable to concentrate on work or studies. The drug is Facebook, and if you fear you may be an addict, now is the time to find out. Fake Facebook profiles were found to be posting malicious links to brand pages such as the U.S National Football League page. When these links were clicked on it would install a computer virus called the Zeus Banking Trojan onto the user's PC . Here are six basic statements. Answer from the following scale: 1 = Very rarely; 2 = Rarely; 3 = Sometimes; 4 = Often and 5 = Very often. You spend a lot of time thinking about Facebook or plan use of Facebook. You feel an urge to use Facebook more and more. You use Facebook in order to forget about personal problems. You have tried to cut down on the use of Facebook without success. You become restless or troubled if you are prohibited from using Facebook. You use Facebook so much that it has had a negative impact on your job/studies. If you score 4 (often) or 5 (always) on at least four of these six points, then you could be addicted to Facebook. Researchers tested a scientific scale on 423 students which measures how hooked users are. They found women are more at risk of addiction because of the social nature of the site. The Norwegian team found ambitious . types are less likely to become addicted as they take advantage of the . site for their own purposes, such as work and networking. The Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale . lets users measure their dependency on the social networking site by . answering six basic questions with how closely they reflect their . behaviour. Those who answer ‘often’ or ‘very often’ to at least four of . the questions are considered addicted. The scale is based on the same six . core elements of addiction used by doctors to identify alcoholics and . drug users, the journal Psychological Reports said. Lead researcher Dr Cecilie Schou . Andreassen, of the University of Bergen’s Faculty of Psychology, said . addiction is more common among younger users. ‘We have also found that people who . are anxious and socially insecure use Facebook more than those with . lower scores on those traits,’ she added. She said this could be because . anxious people find it easier to communicate through social media than . face to face. And users who are late to go to bed . and get up are more likely to be addicted as those with a ‘delayed sleep . wake rhythm’ scored highly, she said. Billionaire Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg: But for some users, the site can be a problem akin to drink or drug addiction . Brain scans of social network users have shown that using sharing sites such as Facebook 'fires up' the same reward channels in the brain as are activated by sex. Diana Tamir, of the Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab at Harvard scanned users of social networks using Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and found that sharing information about themselves triggered the same neural pathways as food, money and sex. Interestingly, participants in the study also said they would pay money to tell others about themselves - although some might argue that Facebook's ever-more-intrusive adverts mean they already DO pay. Dr Andreassen said: ‘The use of . Facebook has increased rapidly. 'We are dealing with a subdivision of . internet addiction connected to social media.’some users, Facebook can . be as addictive as any drug - and now scientists have designed a simple . test to root out addicts from ordinary users. Occasionally doing this, for instance to try and encourage replies from business contacts, is fine. But a constant need to do this could border on addiction. The results from the student volunteers suggested Facebook addiction was more common among younger adults and women rather than men. It was more prevalent among those who are 'anxious and socially insecure' as they are often too introverted to speak in person but happy to maintain an online contact.","Six-point survey roots out genuine Facebook addicts .

"By . Dan Bloom . It's not easy finding a campsite with a river view, but the owner of this caravan may have taken things a bit far. The vehicle reversed straight over a grassy bank and into the water behind a motorway service station. The stranded caravan was spotted today near the M5 in Gloucestershire by photographer Adrian Sherratt - who said its owner may have been stopping for a cup of coffee.

The 44-year-old saw the vehicle in the Little Avon river next to a tiny, single-track lane between Michael Wood services on the M5 and the village of Stone. 'You get people who park up to have a flask of coffee and just look at the water,' he said. 'It looks like someone's been passing and got a bit too close to the edge.

Wotton-under-Edge, added: 'I'm surprised they managed it because it's . been very dry since the floods. The bank shouldn't have been too . slippery for them. Shall I leave it here? The caravan was abandoned hanging partly into the river and with the door left open . 'There are a lot of farm vehicles that go along there so it may also have crashed by backing up and trying to let something past.' Stroud District Council has been told about the caravan and was preparing to remove it, he added.","Caravan left dangling precariously near M5 services in Gloucestershire .

"By . Candace Sutton . Actress Denise Roberts, who plays the mother of Balinese prison inmate Schapelle Corby, has special insight into the jailed drug smuggler's family based on her own brother's 25 years in Sydney prisons . The actress who plays the mother of the notorious Australian drug trafficker about to be released from a Balinese prison has a special understanding of Schapelle Corby because her own brother has spent 25 years in jail. Denise Roberts, whose brother Andrew is a convicted armed robber and one of Australia's most famous prison escapees, says she thinks Schapelle 'got the raw end of the stick'. Roberts' brother, who goes by the criminal alias of Robert Cole, was once played by Australian film star Hugh Jackman in Corelli, which the actress wrote and produced. Roberts based the story on the true prison romance her brother had with a jail psychologist while incarcerated, but the complete story of Cole - real name Andrew David Robertson - is a tale of love, intrigue, betrayal and murder. Cast and crew of the TV movie Schapelle who have praised the 'incredible' transformation Roberts made to play Rosleigh Rose, were unaware of the actress's special insight into Corby's prison ordeal. The movie screens next week, when the real Schapelle is due for release from the Balinese jail where she has been imprisoned since 2005 for smuggling marijuana. Roberts told The Australian Women's Weekly the new film, which the Nine Network airs at 8.30pm on Sunday, 'gives a sympathetic and empathetic view of Schapelle'. 'Guilty or not guilty, I think she got the raw end of the stick,' Roberts said. 'Irrespective of what happened, I don't think anyone should be in a Bali prison that long.' Roberts' brother has spent most of the last 25 years in New South Wales prisons and forensic hospitals serving time for robbery, kidnap, assault and drug and sex offences. He was in Long Bay Prison Hospital in Sydney's south east when  Schapelle Corby was arrested at Bali airport with 4.1kg (9lb) of marijuana in her boogie board bag and locked up in Kerobokan jail. Real life prison visitor: Denise Roberts (above) nailed the character of Schapelle Corby's mother Rosleigh Rose, with her two decades' experience of visiting her brother in Australian prisons . Andrew Robertson, aka Robert Cole, (left) who has spent 20 years in prison, was played by movie star Hugh Jackman in a TV drama written by his actor/writer sister, Denise Roberts who plays Rosleigh Rose, the mother of Schapelle Corby (pictured, right, in a cell at Denpasar Court) in the new TV movie Schapelle . The 28-year-old beauty therapist from the Australian tourist resort strip, the Gold Coast, made international news. Her life since in a crowded cell and the unsanitary confines of Kerobokan has become a national obsession in her home country, making next week's television movie about her a sure TV ratings hit for Channel 9. Before Andrew Robertson's famous escape from an Australian prison, which he made less than a year after Corby's arrest in a foreign country, his eventful past was both a secret and, ironically, the plot of a hugely successful television series in Australia. Unknown to his fellow inmates or few others than close family, Robertson was the basis of the main character of the 13-part Australian TV drama series Corelli, which first screened in 1995. Roberton's sister created and co-wrote Corelli from what she knew of Robertson's forbidden relationship with Robyn Brentnall, a prison psychologist. In Corelli, the prisoner played by Hugh Jackman, in one of his earliest career roles, falls in love with the psychologist of the title, played by Deborra-Lee Furness. The infamous Kerobokan Prison in Bali, where Schapelle Corby has been incarcerated for nine years, a plight Schapelle TV movie actress Denise Roberts can empathise with because of her own armed robber brother's 25 years in jail . The real deal: this is Sydney's notorious Long Bay Jail, from which the brother of Schapelle actress Densie Roberts escaped in 2006, and where he fell for a real life prison psychologist and their romance formed the basis of the TV drama on which star Hugh Jackman met his future wife . The two actors fell in love on the set, married a year later and have adopted two children. Furness has taken a step back from her career while Jackman has gone on to become an international star. Jackman has played Wolverine in the X-Men movie series, he won a Golden Globe for his role in Les Miserables and he is a Tony award-winning singer, dancer and stage performer. The real life prison romance between Andrew Robertson and Robyn Brentnall is a complex tale which preceded Brentnall being struck off the practising roll of the NSW Psychologists Registration Board. The relationship was forged when Robertson sought counselling while he was in a series of prisons, including Long Bay Hospital, where he was serving time for drug possession and breaching a parole order. Robertson was released from prison in 1995, the year Corelli went to air. He went to live with Brentnall, who was sharing a house in Sydney with her daughters and one of their boyfriends, Andrew Mazzitelli. Mazzitelli and Robertson embarked on a crime spree together, committing a series of armed robberies across Sydney's north-west. Brentnall became suspicious and contacted police, who arrested the pair. Both men were jailed. Brentnall was, meanwhile, having problems with Denise Roberts over copyright of her story portrayed in Corelli. Life imitating art: Schapelle star Denise Roberts turned the true prison romance of her criminal brother into the TV drama Corelli, where a young Hugh Jackman in the lead role met his screen romantic interest, Deborra-Lee Furness (left) and the pair fell in love and are married (right) in real life . In a further twist, another man who had fallen in love with Brentnall while she acted as his prison counsellor had been released from jail. Guy Tiskins, who had served time for murdering his girlfriend, contacted Brentnall, who told him she was not interested in him romantically, but she nevertheless disclosed her copyright issues with Denise Roberts. Tiskins allegedly later wrote letters to Roberts threatening to kill her, although he was never charged because of lack of evidence. Robertson spent most of the next decade in prison, visited by his sister Denise, and transferred between different jails until he was legally declared a mentally ill prisoner, or forensic inmate, in 2003 and placed permanently in the maximum security hospital wing at Long Bay Jail. Denise Roberts visited him while he was there, the brother and sister sometimes speaking in the pidgin language they had learned in Papua New Guinea, where they spent a happy childhood. As a prison inquiry would find, late in 2005 Robertson began a drastic diet, which would result in him shedding 13 kg (more than two stone), a fifth of his body weight. At the same time, he had begun to chip away at the bricks in his hospital jail cell with a butter knife, and in the early hours of January 18, 2006, he squeezed his 56kg (8.8 stone) frame through a gap between the brickwork and the steel bars. Avoiding motion detectors and video cameras, he scaled a cyclone fence and climbed over razor wire to freedom. The maximum security escape was an embarrassment for prison authorities and the subject of national derision. Robertson was recaptured five days later in a Sydney shopping centre wearing a fake moustache and beard. Krew Boylan as Schapelle: The TV movie is expected to attract huge audiences when it airs next week . Playing Schapelle Corby's mother, Rosleigh Rose, pictured above with actor Colin Friels, who plays Corby's father, Mick,  Denise Roberts knew the trauma and heartbreak of having a family members in prison . Even thought he was subsequently released after serving time for his escape, Robertson reoffended and was again jailed, this time for aggravated sexual assault and detaining a person with intent to obtain advantage. He remains in custody. Denise Roberts told MailOnline she had drawn on two characteristics to play Schapelle Corby's mother, 'her fighting spirit and the fact she's a mother' and that she believed Rosleigh Rose had the 'stamina and endurance to see anything through'. Roberts said she believed Corby had done enough jail time, particularly as one criminal linked with the 2002 Bali bombings, which killed 202 people, had been released from prison years ago. Roberts said she did not wish to comment about her brother and his imprisonment. In 2006, following Robertson's escape, Denise Roberts told the Seven Network she feared for him if he was returned to prison. 'I think he's more dangerous to himself than he is to anyone else,' she said at the time. 'I dread to think what he'll do if he is taken back there.' She later told his court hearing: 'It has been a revolving door system for [him]. 'When he comes out of jail he goes onto drugs.' Roberts, who along with her acting career runs the leading Australian film and television school, Screenwise, has helped launch the careers of some of the country's young talent, including Chris Hemsworth (The Avengers, Thor: the Dark World).","Actress playing drug smuggler Schapelle Corby's mother has a brother who has spent 25 years in jail .

"By . Candace Sutton . A Japanese harpoon whaling ship has rammed a conservationist protestors' vessel in dramatic scenes in icy seas off Antarctica. Video released by anti-whaling organisation, Sea Shepherd, shows the Japanese ship the Yushin Maru 2 crashing into the bow of the Bob Barker on Sunday in the Southern Ocean off the South Pole. Sea Shepherd claims the collision was deliberate and part of a sustained attack by three whaling ships on the protestors. Scroll down for video . Collision: Japanese whaling vessel Yuhsin Maru No. 3, left, and Sea Shepherd's the Bob Barker collide in the remote, icy seas off Antarctica . A Japanese harpoon whaling vessel cuts across the bow of the Sea Shepherd boat Steve Irwin in dramatic scenes in the icy waters off Antarctica on Sunday . A Japanese whaling boat cuts off the Bob Barker, the ship of activist group Sea Shepherd in the Ross Sea off Antarctica as the anti-whaling protestors attempt to stop the slaughter in the Southern Ocean . The Sea Shepherd boats, the Bob Barker and the Steve Irwin, were patrolling off Antarctica in the Ross Sea, the most pristine marine ecosystem on earth in which a high concentration of marine wildlife has remained mostly free from pollution, mining and fishing. Known as ""the last ocean"", the Ross Sea teems with large predatory fish, whales, seals and penguins. The Sea Shepherd vessels had sailed to the Ross Sea to interfere with a Japanese whaling fleet comprising the Yushin Maru, Yushin Maru 2, Yushin Maru 3 and the world's only whaling factory ship, the Nisshin Maru. Sea Shepherd claims the Japanese ships launched a sustained eight hour attack from around 1am Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT) on Sunday. Sea Shepherd said its ships had positioned themselves off the Nisshin Maru's slipway to block the harpoon vessels from loading the corpses of whales they had caught onto the factory ship. The Nisshin Maru is chartered by Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR), which claims to be a nonprofit research organization of whales and dolphins, but which Sea Shepherd and Greenpeace say is just a Japanese Government-funded operation for slaughtering whales for profit. Japanese crewman aboard the Yushin Maru as it harpoons whales in the icy waters off the South Pole . Conservationists risked their lives in the icy waters of the Ross Sea, off the South Pole to stop Japanese crews whales in the earth's last untouched ocean . In Sunday's attack, which continued until 9am, the harpoon vessels overtook the Sea Shepherd ships, crossing their bows and coming within three to five metres in numerous ""dangerous manoeuvres"", Sea Shepherd claimed. It said the Yushin Maru 3 struck the Bob Barker and quoted the ship's captain, Peter Hammarstedt, and  Siddarth Chakravarty of the Steve Irwin saying the two ships on several occasions had to steer out of the harpoon whalers' paths, narrowly avoiding potential collisions. 'The whaling vessels also made consecutive attempts to foul the propellers of the Sea Shepherd ships by dragging steel cable across the bow of the conservation ships,' Sea Shepherd said. Greenpeace claims the Nisshin Maru has twice rammed its vessel, the Arctic Sunrise,  although the Institute for Cetacean Research contested Greenpeace was to blame. ICR says on its website Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd engage in dangerous 'sabotage' which endangers life at sea. 'Sea Shepherd group, one of several Greenpeace offshoots, joined the interference against Japan's whale research and, imitating Greenpeace methods such as illegal boarding and ramming of research vessels, started to use increasingly dangerous and violent sabotage methods which include entangling devices (propeller foulers), throwing and shooting of chemical-containing projectiles, smoke bombs and incendiary devices,' ICR said. Japanese whalers drag a minke whale harpooned in the Southern Ocean off Antarctica last year . A pilot whale is netted off the cove at Taiji, Japan, where a pod of dolphins was slaughtered in October last year . An Australian conservationist who witnessed Japanese crewmen herd a pod of dolphins into a cove off Taiji, Japan,heard the 'distressed cries' of the dolphins as they died . 'Such dangerous actions by these groups are not peaceful protest but unforgivable acts akin to terrorism that threaten human life at sea. 'Over and over again we have strongly condemned the harassment and sabotage actions by these groups and demand again that they refrain from further spreading violence under pretext of protecting whales.' Sea Shepherd's team of volunteers from around the world has photographed the ICR's harpooning of whales, and slaughter of dolphins in the Japanese port of Taiji. Australian Alana West told of the scene at Taiji last year, when the Japanese  team herded a pod of striped dolphins into Taiji Cove and how she could hear 'the distress cries of the dying pod members'. 'Although the noise and confusion of the killing must have been terrifying for these dolphins, they did not swim to the other end of the Cove, as they so wanted to be with their pod members who were in fear and pain and were taking their last breaths,' Alana said. 'It was incredibly harrowing to witness.'","Dramatic video of Japanese whalers ramming boats off South Pole .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nick Clegg today admitted his handling of groping claims against Lord Rennard last year was ‘not ideal’ as he vowed not to back down in calling for an apology from the Lib Dem peer. The Deputy Prime Minister also conceded that ‘alarm bells did not go off’ within the party when the allegations were first made several years ago. Ex-chief executive Lord Rennard denies any wrongdoing and is threatening to sue the Lib Dems for suspending his membership after refusing to say sorry to the women. Scroll down for video . Admission: Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the party's handling of the crisis was 'not ideal' Mr Cleg’s leadership has become engulfed by the row, with many activists accusing him of failing to act while peers in the House of Lords support Lord Rennard. Hosting his weekly radio-phone, the Lib Dem leader was bombarded with questions and criticism about the case. Last week an internal inquiry found that four women had made ‘credible’ allegations against the peer, but found there was a less than 50 per cent chance they would pass the burden of proof ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. However Alistair Webster QC recommended Lord Rennard - who has strenuously denied wrongdoing - apologise, something he has refused to do, leading to his suspension on Monday. Party split: Lord Rennard denies any wrongdoing and has refused to apologise for the distress caused to women who allege that they were groped by him . Miriam González Durántez has angrily hit back at claims that she put pressure on her husband Nick Clegg to take a tougher stance on sex pest allegations against Lord Rennard. In a highly unusual public statement, the lawyer and mother-of-three insisted she had nothing to do with the decision to suspend the peer from the party, describing a report suggesting so as ‘a complete fabrication’. Ms González Durántez, who was attending a National Inspiring Women campaign event to get women to go into schools to talk about their careers, said: ‘This is in the Telegraph today but it is a complete fabrication. I don't even know the women. ‘I think by now that you will know I'm the kind of woman who doesn't influence in the shadows. If I ever wanted to say something I would say that openly. My opinions about the political issues of the day, I keep them for myself.’ Earlier, the Deputy Prime Minister also insisted it was ‘just not on’ to drag his family into the row and dismissed the claims as ‘garbage’. ‘I've read so much garbage over the last several days about what I think, what my motives are, what I've done here, what I've done there, and now suddenly claims are being made about conversations which, if they took place, would take place probably in the privacy of the Clegg kitchen,’ Mr Clegg told LBC radio. ‘It's total garbage, it is a complete work of fiction. Look, you can make up stuff about me, as indeed people do day in day out, have a go at me, but just don't drag Miriam into it.' In a 2,600-word statement Lord Rennard threatened to sue the party for kicking him out of the Lib Dem 'family'. But Mr Clegg insisted he would not drop his demand for an apology. He . told LBC 97.3: ‘Let me really be open with you, I actually think the . way that we handled it last year wasn’t great, wasn’t ideal. ‘Much . more seriously than that, looking much further back, it is quite clear . that when the women were first caused this distress, many, many years . ago…the Party did not react, the alarm bells did not go off, and there . weren’t procedures, and that’s what I’ve apologised to them in person, . and publically.’ Mr Clegg said he had to demand that Lord Rennard says sorry - even if only for causing ‘inadvertent’ distress to women. He went on: ‘Just imagine if we had done anything else. Just imagine if Alistair Webster (QC) had recommended that an apology should be issued and I came out and said ‘Thank you very much, we will file away the report, and by the way, none of the recommendations need to be accepted or adhered to’. ‘There would have quite rightly been outrage. ‘It is messy. It is difficult to confront the past and turn a page and introduce a new culture in any organisation, particularly a political party - quite rightly under remorseless scrutiny. ‘But there is no way round my view that I want people in my party, the party I lead, to treat each other with respect, with civility, with dignity.’ Lib Dem tensions over the row have been ratcheting up, with ex-leader Lord Steel joining calls for the threat of expulsion to be lifted from Lord Rennard. Mr Webster’s inquiry found the allegations against the peer could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt but said there was broadly credible evidence that women had been caused distress. The former election supremo has been suspended from the party pending a disciplinary hearing into whether his refusal to apologise is bringing it into disrepute. He continues to deny any wrongdoing and is considering seeking an injunction to halt the process. Lib Dem peers are due to meet later, with significant numbers thought to be sympathetic to Lord Rennard’s position.","Lord Rennard suspended from party pending another investigation .

"By . Richard Spillett . and Lizzie Edmonds . A video of an alleged Islamist fanatic said to be a former Arsenal player has been posted on a Jihadist website. The footage, apparently shot in Syria, shows the man calling on Muslims in the West to travel to the war-torn region and fight with radical militants. The man, whose face is hidden by a balaclava and is seen clutching a AK47 rifle, is identified as Abu Isa al-Andalus. Scroll down for video . A video posted on an extremist website claims to be of a former Arsenal footballer now fighting in Syria . According to FiSyria.com, the site that posted the video, the man moved to London from his native country to play for Arsenal after growing up alongside a world-famous footballer. It claims the man was radicalised in the capital two years ago before 'leaving everything' to join the al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Speaking in heavily-accented English, the man makes a tirade against the West and urges others to follow his lead and take up arms. He says: 'I have some words of advice to give to you. My advice to you is that, first of all, we are in need of all types of help, from those who can help us in fighting the enemy. Welcome come and join us. The man's face is covered during the video, in which he clutches an AK47 assault rifle . A spokesman for Arsenal say they have no record of a past player called Abu Isa al-Andalus, although it is thought the man may have changed his identity . He later adds: 'We have conquered . many cities and we are now implementing the Sharia. We have areas where . the kaffirs (non-Muslims) are paying us the tax. 'If we stay in the kaffir countries we have to pay (taxes) to them. Do you want to be humiliated by this? Think about it. 'If you have family in these (Western) countries it's a must for you to put your children in the kaffir schools. ""Who is going to teach your children?"" It's going to maybe be a gay, maybe a drug dealer, maybe a paedophile. 'It's very important for you to protect your children. Allah says they are the worst of creatures.' The Russian-based website does not confirm the man's previous identity on the page, which shows two videos each roughly four-minutes long. Text next to the video reads: 'He... played for Arsenal in London, and [then] left football, money and the European way of life to make the path of Allah.' A spokesman for Arsenal said: 'We do not recognise the individual from the published clips and we donâ€™t have any record of a Mr Abu Iza Andalusi representing the club at any level.' Senior security officials have said that at least 250 British-based 'extremist tourists' have gone to Syria to train and fight. Director General of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT) Charles Farr said earlier this year that the war in the country now presents 'the biggest challenge' since the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Mr Farr said: 'Syria is different from any other counter-terrorism challenge that we have faced since 9/11, because of the number of terrorist groups now engaged in the fighting, their size and scale, the number of people from this country who are joining them, ease of travel, availability of weapons and the intensity of the conflict.'

"By . Daniel Martin . 'Unwelcome advances': An independent report leaked today makes serious allegations about the sexual conduct of MP Mike Hancock . Nick Clegg was last night struggling to contain another sex scandal after his party tried to suppress ‘credible’ allegations of misconduct by an MP. The Liberal Democrats finally suspended Mike Hancock yesterday, more than three years after a vulnerable constituent first complained about him. Incredibly, Mr Clegg acted only after an   independent report by a QC,  who found prima facie evidence that the 67-year-old MP was guilty of ‘serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour’, was leaked online. This is despite the fact the complainant, known only as Annie or AH, wrote to Mr Clegg in March 2011 about her frustrations over the case. Her letter said: ‘I am also deeply upset that as the Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats, you have done nothing to oust this man from politics. He cannot be trusted and he is a liability to women, the public and also your party. His conduct should be a matter for you as leader of the party.’ The report into Mr Hancock’s conduct was given to the party last August. He had resigned the Lib Dem whip last June after the woman threatened to sue. But the report was never published and on Tuesday the Lib Dem-controlled council in Portsmouth – where Mr Hancock is also a councillor – voted to keep it under wraps. It emerged only when political internet blogger ‘Guido Fawkes’ published it yesterday. In his report, Nigel Pascoe QC also says he could see no reason why it should not be published straight away. Last night critics asked how it was possible that the party leadership had done nothing to discipline the married MP for so long – and had not even asked to see the report into one of their MPs until yesterday. Coming at the height of the furore engulfing Lord Rennard – who is refusing to apologise for a string of sex allegations by female party members – the case will ingrain the idea that Mr Clegg has little or no grip on his party. 'You are special and sexy':  Liberal Democrat MP Mike Hancock allegedly sent a string of lewd texts containing filthy comments to woman, who had mental health problems and had previously been sexually abused . Incredibly, Nick Clegg acted only after an independent report by a QC, who found prima facie evidence that the 67-year-old MP was guilty of 'serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour', was leaked online . The allegations against Mr Hancock, MP for Portsmouth South, are even more serious than those against Lord Rennard. The alleged victim accused the father of two – who was more than 30 years her senior – of exposing himself in front of her,  ‘forcibly’ kissing her until she had red marks on her arms, and begging her to perform sex acts upon him. Mr Pascoe found that the vulnerable constituent – who had a personality disorder and had been sexually abused as a child – had also been bombarded by lewd text messages from Mr Hancock for months. On a later occasion he allegedly took her to the House of Commons where he ‘kept topping her wine up’ and ‘ran his fingers through her hair’. He bought her gifts, including a House of Commons teddy bear – which he sprayed with his aftershave and asked her to sleep with. When Annie was told that the police were not going to prosecute she said she felt like shooting herself. Mr Hancock was arrested in 2010 in connection with the allegations, but Hampshire Police decided there was not enough evidence to mount a criminal case. A civil case is pending in the High Court. Portsmouth Council, which commissioned the report, said its legal advice was that it could not publish the report until that case had been completed. But Mr Pascoe said that, in his view, there was no reason why it should not be published. Leak: Councillors on Portsmouth's Lib Dem-run council voted to keep the report (pictured) secret last night but it has made its way into the public domain via the Guido Fawkes website today . It is not the first time Mr Hancock has been embroiled in a sex scandal. Four years ago an affair with researcher Katia Zatulieveter was exposed . In addition, a Lib Dem spokesman said last night that the leadership had not even seen the QC’s report until yesterday. ‘Given Nigel Pascoe QC’s conclusions in his report, we have immediately suspended Mike Hancock’s membership of the party,’ he said. Labour MP Sheila Gilmore said: ‘The Lib Dems are descending into chaos. This case once again sends out an appalling message to women. Nick Clegg needs to stop dithering and show some leadership.’ It is not the first time Mr Hancock has been embroiled in a sex scandal. Four years ago an affair with Russian researcher Katia Zatulieveter, 27, was exposed. She worked for him in the Commons and was accused of spying for Moscow – but the allegations were never proved. The damning report into the latest scandal includes interviews with AH about the events of early 2010, when she was aged 35. The alleged victim, who gave evidence under oath, said of Mr Hancock: ‘He forcibly kissed me. He grabbed my arms and he stuck his tongue down my throat.’ On another occasion, she said, Mr . Hancock undid his belt and exposed himself. ‘I said, “put it away, I think you are disgusting and you need some help; you have a sexual problem”,’ the report said. The alleged victim told the QC: ‘That was the worst time, this really affected me.’ Party split: Lord Rennard denies any wrongdoing and has refused to apologise for the distress caused to women who allege that they were groped by him . In his conclusions, Mr Pascoe said: ‘Making full allowances for the disclosed mental history of AH, I have no doubt that she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour carried out towards her by Mr Hancock. ‘I am of the clear view that her account if credible and merits both compassion and respect.’ Mr Pascoe called on the authorities to decide whether criminal proceedings should start again, adding: ‘The time for equivocation has ended. These matters should have been addressed definitively a long time ago in the interests of AH and Mr Hancock.’ Mr Hancock is also a city councillor in Portsmouth and still represents the Liberal Democrats at City Hall . Claims: Mike Hancock (pictured) has repeatedly denied claims he sent sexy texts and made sexual advances towards a troubled female constituent . The woman had originally contacted Mr Hancock over a dispute about noisy neighbours. She . told the solicitor that Mr Hancock knew she had mental health problems. She had been abused ‘in a family setting’ between the ages of ten and . 14, raped at 18, and had suffered from eating disorders since the age of . 14. Last night Mr Pascoe said he was disappointed that only a redacted version of the report had come to light, adding: ‘It would be better for my full report to be published sooner rather than later,’ he said. Before the suspension was announced, a spokesman for Mr Hancock said: ‘These matters have twice been looked at by the police, first in 2010, and in conjunction with the CPS, they have found that there is no case for Mr Hancock to answer and have taken no further action. ‘As this is an ongoing legal case, it not appropriate for Mike to give a running commentary.’ A Lib Dem source last night denied the report had been suppressed. ‘Portsmouth councillors were advised by the city solicitors that the report should not be published until the outcome of the civil action,’ he said. ‘This was not a political decision.’","Lib Dems voted not to release report on Mike Hancock but it was leaked .

"By . Ryan Gorman . An Oklahoma woman has finally spoken out about why she faked her own kidnapping only months before her 2010 wedding – she had cold feet. Tiffiny Bray, 42, of Oklahoma City, stole her fiancé's pickup truck, shacked up with another man in a Corpus Christi, Texas motel room and pretended to be kidnapped in July 2010 because she decided against marrying Chad McGuire. The runaway bride-to-be pawned jewelry he bought her on her way to meet an internet beau named Steve. She told ABC News in a recent interview that she ran because she felt like she was suffocating. Write caption here . ‘I mean Chad was a nice guy,’ said Ms Bray. ‘I just was not happy with my life in general, I just felt like I couldn't breathe anymore.’ Ms Bray’s strange odyssey began July 20, 2010 when she told Mr McGuire she was borrowing his truck to go shopping. She never looked back. ‘The last text I heard from her was around noon,’ Mr McGuire said. ‘She asked what I wanted for lunch.’ She pawned a heart necklace given to her for Valentine’s Day and drove due south. ‘The whole time I was driving I was shaking,’ Ms Bray recalled. ‘I was so confused.’ He would not hear from her until 96 hours later, when she sent a cryptic text message pleading for help. Cold feet: Mr Bray says she ran because she felt like she couldn't breathe . ‘Need help. Somewhere in Lawton in dark room. White man. Please f*****g help me. Not sure I [can] use this again.’ Mr McGuire immediately contact authorities, they dropped everything to find the seemingly endangered woman. ‘When a text message comes in of that nature, that takes it to the forefront of the seriousness of what may be going on,’ said Richard Goss, special agent in charge of Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. Friends, including Tommy Lewis, also joined in the search. ‘We spent our time and money searching, trying to assist investigators, give them any information we could,’ said Mr Lewis. Mr McGuire was put under intense scrutiny, at one point even accused by OSBI agents of killing Ms Bray – ‘I had one ask me where the body was.’ Charged with lying: Investigators took Mr Bray to court over the false kidnapping claims, a judge agreed and ordered her to repay the $34,000 cost of the investigation . Police eventually discovered Ms Bray had been chatting with a Texas man identified only as Steve.They tracked his cell phone to the Corpus Christi motel – more than 500 miles from where Ms Bray claimed to have been kidnapped to. Agents hurriedly busted down the door only to find the woman had planned an elaborate scheme to avoid marrying Mr McGuire. ‘Tiffiny was there in the room by herself... when we walked into the motel room, and she was safe and sound,’ Mr Goss recalled. ‘We knew it had all been a hoax.’ Mr Bray’s new flame had no idea that she was on the lam. ‘It was my escape,’ she said of driving to Texas. ‘It was my way out.’ Officials charged her with a number of counts related to her flight and false reporting of a crime. Instead of serving jail time, she was ordered to repay the $34,000 OSBI spent looking for her. She works 60 hours a week to pay off the debt. Oh, and, she did finally get married – to Tommy Lewis. When asked if he was concerned about her getting cold feet again before their big day, he quipped ‘I'd be lying if it didn't cross my mind.’","Tiffiny Bray took off in July 2010 only months before she was to marry fiance Chad McGuire .

"By . Candace Sutton . In the 70-year-old crime scene photograph, the body of Alice Anderson lies slumped face down on the floor, under the prone corpse of her husband Maurice who appears to be dressed in his air force uniform. Blood trails across the floor and smears a door, indicating the 34-year-old wife staggered a short way before succumbing to the two bullets shot into her head from her pilot husband's revolver. The scenes captured inside a cramped Sydney flat on an Autumn evening in 1944 are of disarray. 70 year old tragedy: Sydney police crime scene photographs from 1944 show Australian airforce bomber pilot Maurice Anderson's body slumped over his 34-year-old wife, Alice, in their flat near Bondi Beach after the traumatised airman shot her and then turned the gun on himself . Other signs of the struggle that must have occurred in the final minutes of the couple's murder suicide can be seen in the photograph of the flat's main room, where a cabinet is tilted on its side and a chair has been knocked over beneath portraits of the pair on the mantlepiece. The last images of the tragic Anderson couple were only recently identified among photographs uncovered from a vault of police evidence pictures. Police photos of crimes scenes and accidents, and mug shots of criminals and suspects dating back to 1920s Sydney, were found in a chest submerged in water in the late 1980s. Trail of blood: the police photographs, finally identified from pictures uncovered in a submerged chest reveal the blood trail left by Alice Anderson after, shot twice in the head by her husband, she staggered a short way before he dragged her body into the bedroom and shot himself . Predicted her own death: These unearthed Sydney police forensic photos show the futile attempt by Alice Anderson to flee the flat after he husband shot her on May 3, 1944, just  a day after she predicted her own death . Donated to one of Australia's premier government historic trusts, Sydney Living Museums, the collection of 130,000 black-and-white images of 20th century forensic records have gradually been restored and identified. The Anderson murder- suicide crime scenes were among a series of negatives found in an envelope labelled 'Murder of Alice and Morris Anderson, Waverley'. The story of what happened before police forced their way into the dead couple's flat, near Sydney's famous Bondi beach one Wednesday night after neighbours heard sounds of a disturbance, can now be told. And as reports in Australian newspapers at the time attest, the young wife had a premonition of her death, telling a relative a day earlier, 'Don't be surprised if you see in the papers that I have been shot'. Alice and her husband, 40-year-old Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) officer Maurice Reuben John Anderson, had only moved the week before into the furnished two room flat, one of six couples and other single renters crowded into a three room house, for which the couple paid Â£3, 5 shillings a week. Scene of the crime: Birrell Street, Waverley, near Bondi Beach, in the 1940s where Alice and Maurice Anderson lived when he decided to end their lives one Autumn day in 1944 . Mystery solved: Neighbours in the flats on Birrell Street, Waverley (pictured, left, in 1946) described murder suicide couple Maurice and Alice Anderson as 'affectionate' but became suspicious after hearing a disturbance on the night on May 3, 1944, according to  newspaper reports (right) published the next day which museum curators have now linked with the previously unidentified crime scene found in a submerged chest . Flying Officer Johnson was not well, and was suspected of having suffered 'war neurosis' during his service overseas in the RAAF's 11 Squadron in World War II. The 11 Squadron carried out bombing attacks against the Japanese ships in Papua New Guinea, in Port Moresby, carrying out an intense series of air raids on enemy targets in the latter part of 1943.At the end of the war, 11 Squadron dropped food and medical supplies to prisoner-of-war camps across south-east Asia and flew survivors back to Australia. On May 4, 1944, Officer Anderson was due to go into hospital for abdominal surgery. In the days leading up to their deaths, the couple had seemed well enough, and despite Mrs Anderson's dramatic disclosure to her relative, they were seen hanging out the washing together on Tuesday, May 2, apparently in 'good spirits'. Neighbours described them as affectionate couple who nevertheless kept themselves aloof. Around 7.30 pm on May 3, noise of a confrontation above the sound of a wireless playing came from the flat, which blazed with light, and from which wafted the smell of burning potatoes. Hands of a strangler, 1953: Eileen Joyce Jenkins, 33, a former choirgirl was found strangled with a sash cord in her flat in November 1953. Her husband of five months, a 55-year-old public servant John Eric Jenkins whose hands (pictured) were captured by police photographer Walter Tuchin, was found not guilty of her murder on the grounds of inasanity. Jenkins told the court he had placed the sash a round his wife's throat, telling her it was 'an experiment', when something 'snapped' in his brain and he pulled it tightly until she was dead . The Hurlstone park murder : on the morning of 3 November 1928 a neighbour burst into the kitchen (pictured) of a cottage in Hurlstone Park, in southern Sydney, to find Lucy Priscilla Brock dead on the floor with a cut throat and Henry Loftus Brock lying on a chair, with a gash in his throat but alive. Brock claimed they had been attacked, but a coronial inquiry later found that an increasingly paranoid Brock - who later died - had killed his wife . Riddle of the sea: On February 22, 1954, police were called to a cliff side in the Sydney beach surburb of Tamarama, where a car had plunged over the edge. The body of 44-year-old Lithuanian-born Dr Joseph Blank washed up in the surf. While police were puzzling over why he had driven off the cliff, the remains of another person were thrown up by the sea. They were identified as Lithuanian woman, Judy Arane, 27, whose family said she had arrived seven years earlier after being held in a German prisoner of war camp, and was 'just beginning to enjoy life'. It was a mystery as to why she was in the car . Death scene inside a house in the harbourside Sydney suburb of Potts Point photographed on February 24, 1954 . At 7.40pm, Mr PJ Kennedy, who lived in an adjoining apartment, became suspicious and peered through a window. He called another neighbour, a Mr H Phillips, from the rooms above and they telephoned police. Two police inspectors and two detective sergeants arrived at the Birrell Street, Waverley address and climbed in through the window to discover the couple lying on the bedroom floor, shot through the head. Piecing together what had happened by the position of the bodies, the detectives formed the opinion Mrs Anderson had been sitting on a dining chair in the lounge room when she was shot twice through the head. A blood trail indicated she had jumped from the chair, knocking it over as she staggered to the door of the flat. The police believed Anderson then caught hold of his wife, dragging her into the bedroom and, as she slumped dead to the floor, he shot himself. He then fell across his wife's body and his revolver was found beneath him. A bullet was found lodged in his brain. Although police said they could find no motive for the tragedy, a news report later said Maurice Anderson may have been haunted by the fear his wife would not properly be cared for while he was undergoing a serious operation. Sydney Living Museums' series of forensic photograph exhibitions have generated wide public interest and now include the collection of retired police photographer, Walter Tuchin. Tuchin photographed murderers, car crashes and a variety of crime scenes for the New South Wales Scientific Investigation Bureau between 1952 and 1957.","Seventy year old Australian crime scene photographs found in submerged chest have been identified .

"By . Candace Sutton . A 28-year-old Australian mother faces a desperate wait to learn whether she will go to trial for killing her baby daughter who died after being left in a car on a hot summer's day in a country town. Jayde Poole, an A-grade netball coach, was a single mother of three young children before the December day in 2012 when she strapped her youngest into a car seat and forgot her in 30-plus degree temperatures. The tragedy happened in the inland Victorian town of Bendigo while Australia was undergoing a series of heatwaves, with temperatures reaching record highs in the December 2012 holiday season. Australian mum Jayde Poole faces a trial for manslaughter after she left her baby daughter in her car on a hot day in a country town . Poole, who has made a formal application for charges against her to be dropped, faces up to 20 years for the manslaughter of baby Bella if convicted. Committed to stand trial for manslaughter, Poole is approaching a court hearing which will determine her fate. But she has tearfully pleaded she has no memory of placing five-month-old Bella in the back seat, and thought originally her daughter had been kidnapped. The tragedy unfolded on the evening of December 11, 2012 in Bendigo, where the average temperature during the three hours Bella was strapped in the car topped 30 degrees celsius. Poole, who lived with her children at her parents' house, had left home in the late afternoon to fetch a Hungry Jacks meal for her six-year-old son. Normally, she would have left Bella at home with her mother, Debra, but Bella was grouchy and so Poole put her in the baby seat, facing backwards, for the short car ride. They arrived home at 4.45pm. Poole locked the car with the remote control and carried the drinks into the house. The boy finished his food at the kitchen table. Poole's older daughter woke from a nap and the children's grandparents sat at their computers checking out items on eBay. Poole would later say in a police interview she believed she had put Bella down to sleep in a cot. At some point, the older two children were bathed. Poole took a cup of tea outside and lit a cigarette to smoke while she telephoned her friend, Bree McOrmond, who was engaged to marry Poole's brother. It was after 6.30pm, and still hot. A post mortem found traces of morphine in the body of five-month-old Bella, who died after mum Jayde Poole (above) left her in a hot car . The two friends chatted about Christmas shopping. The conversation lasted 19 minutes and 44 seconds until Poole heard her son call, 'Mum, Mum' and ended the call. Poole then went to check on Bella in her cot in a front room of the house. Neither Bella nor her bottle was in the cot. Poole rang her sister, Megan Hillier, in a panic and told her: 'I put her down for a sleep and she's not there. Someone's taken her.' Poole hung up and rang the Bendigo police to report a child abduction. The police arrived within ten minutes and started searching the house. Poole's brother, Christopher, was the first of several family members to turn up amid flashing blue lights, sirens and confusion among the neighbours who gathered outside the crime scene tape on the street. An officer asked Poole to open her car which was parked not 200 metres from the house. They made the terrible discovery - Bella in her car seat, not moving. Poole broke down, crying and screaming. The baby was taken to hospital where medical staff tried to revive her. It was too late. They declared Bella dead. Dr Mark Putland later told police he believed the child had been dead for some time before reaching hospital. He observed 'bluish purple discolouration' on Bella's back and buttocks, which indicated the child was 'really dead'. A post mortem on Bella discovered traces of morphine. Forensic examiners questioned whether paramedics administered the drug instead of adrenaline. Over the ensuing year, as the Poole family tried to come to terms with the little girl's death, the Victorian Office of Public Prosecutions mounted a case against Jayde Poole. Following a committal hearing, in which Jayde Poole sat tearfully, supported by her parents and siblings, she was ordered to stand trial for manslaughter. A directions hearing earlier this month will continue on February 12, when Justice Terry Forrest will make the final decision of whether to proceed to trial in the Victorian Supreme Court. Jayde Poole intends to enter a plea of not guilty if the seven to 10 day trial goes ahead. The prosecution will call members of her family, along with police and ambulance officers and medical staff as witnesses. Justice Forrest said he expected little dispute over the facts of the case, should it proceed to trial. Prosecutor Michele Williams SC said there would not be ""any factual dispute at all', but that the case against Poole might be dropped because it was 'different' from other child death cases. Jayde Poole's relatives have told police she was a 'loving mum' and her children were 'always dressed well and clean and happy'. Her mother Debra denied she was forgetful, saying she was 'really switched on' and would 'never do anything to hurt her kids'. Bella Poole's death is the second high profile Australian case of a child dying after it was left in a car. In Perth, Western Australia, last October, a father forgot to drop off his  son at a daycare centre. When he went to collect the boy, he was told the11-month-old had never arrived. The boy was in the back of the father's car and unable to be revived. Psychologists call this kind of tragic lapse of memory 'forgotten child syndrome' and say a rare combination of factors which combine to form the 'perfect storm' of memory error happens to parents around the world.","Australian mother, 28,  to stand trial for killing baby she left in a hot car .

"By . Amanda Williams . Simon Bramhall, a consultant in Birmingham, is being investigated after a colleague said he discovered the letters 'S B' during a follow up operation . An experienced surgeon has been suspended amid claims he branded a patient's liver with his initials. It is alleged that Simon Bramhall, a consultant at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, is being investigated after a colleague said he discovered the letters 'S B'  on an organ during a follow-up operation. It is said that he used argon gas to burn his initials on the patient. The gas is used to seal vessels, but is not usually harmful. A source close to Mr Bramhall said that he had performed 'hundreds of transplants'. They added: 'If an organ has been made available by the family of someone who has passed away, the last thing they would want is to find it has been violated. 'I am hoping this is just a mistake. ' I don't know what would possess someone to do that to another human being. 'Imagine if the person died and was an organ donor, would the new owner of that liver want it to be branded? 'I doubt it very much.' Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern, added: 'This is a patient we are talking about, not an autograph book.'

"By . James Chapman . and Matt Chorley . Shares in leading energy firms dropped by up to five per cent today as the markets reacted to Labour’s 1970s-style plan to freeze power bills. Energy firms said capping prices would halt the investment needed to avoid blackouts and lead to gas and electricity shortages. But Labour leader Ed Miliband today dismissed the 'scare stories' which he claimed were being pedalled by the firms which have been overcharging people for years. Scroll down for video . Fight: Ed Miliband, pictured with shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, has vowed to take on energy firms which warned of power shortages if he pushes ahead with his plan to freeze bills for 20 months . Address: Mr Miliband used his conference speech yesterday to offer himself to the electorate as a 'one nation' prime minister . Labour Leader Ed Miliband thanks Baroness Lawrence after her speech . The Labour leader’s pledge to fix bills until 2017 if he wins the general election, which is calculated to appeal to struggling families, was welcomed by consumer groups. But it prompted an extraordinary threat from one energy giant to quit the UK. Centrica said it would ‘not be economically viable to continue’ if it had to freeze prices when its costs were rising. The firm’s chairman Sir Roger Carr called the policy ‘a recipe for economic ruin’. Shares in Centrica, which owns British Gas dropped by five per cent on early trading to less than 377p. Scottish and Southern Electric also saw shares drop in value, down more than four percent to 1,512p/ . Angela Knight, of the Energy UK trade association, warned Mr Miliband's plan would risk jobs and threaten the energy supply. 'Freezing . the bill, may be superficially attractive, but it will also freeze the . money to build and renew power stations, freeze the jobs and livelihoods . of the 600,000 plus people dependent on the energy industry and make . the prospect of energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for . everyone,' she added. Liberal Democrat energy secretary Ed Davey said: ‘When they tried to . fix prices in California it resulted in an electricity crisis and . widespread blackouts. We can’t risk the lights going out here too. ‘Fixing prices in this way risks blackouts, jeopardises jobs and puts investment in clean, green technology in doubt.’ No UK government has tried to fix electricity prices since the 1970s. Guy . Newey, of the Policy Exchange  think-tank, said: ‘Labour would be . better off scrapping some of the excesses in  green policy.’ But Richard Lloyd, of the consumer group . Which?, said: ‘Ed Miliband’s promise to fix the broken energy market and . freeze prices will give hope to the millions worrying about how they . can afford to heat their homes. We now look forward to seeing the detail . of how this will work.’ On ice: Labour has produced models of an energy bill in a block of ice to show how the party would freeze prices for two years . Energy price controls contributed to devastating power cuts across large swathes of California a decade ago. Long-term price caps in the state were identified as a major disincentive for consumers to conserve energy. Critics said they also led to a lack of investment in energy infrastructure because the power firms, knowing they could not raise prices, had little incentive to increase output. Crisis struck in the year 2000 and continued well into the following year. Millions of people across the state were subject to rolling blackouts lasting for up to two hours.In the winter of 200-1, children in some parts of the state were sent to school with blankets and extra clothes to keep warm and teachers handed out torches. American football fans were told to huddle together to watch the Superbowl to reduce the number of television sets draining power supplies. The power cuts led to chaotic scenes across the state, with people trapped in lifts, and traffic lights suddenly going off in the middle of the day. Energy prices briefly jumped by as much as 800 per cent when the controls were relaxed. But the price controls were only part of the problem in California, which also suffered from market manipulation by some firms and illegal pipeline shutdowns by the power firm Enron. Under the plan, if Labour wins the next election it will immediately legislate to stop price rises for 20 months. It will save the average household £120 each and businesses will be £1,800 better off on their gas and electricity bills. Mr . Miliband also promised to scrap the energy watchdog Ofgem and use the . 20 months to overall the competition and transparency rules to smash the . dominance of the Big Six energy firms. Labour estimates it the government intervention on prices will cost the Big Six a total of £4.5billion in lost profits. However, . it is unclear what could be done to stop the energy companies from . jacking up their prices on the eve of the 2015 election. Today Mr Miliband accused the energy companies of peddling 'scare stories' about the potential impact of the price freeze. He told ITV's Daybreak: 'I would say that they are pretty unreliable witnesses, because these are people who are overcharging people, so of course they are going to say when someone calls  time on it that they are not very happy. 'Then we have got the Government taking their side and saying the same thing, supporting the energy companies. 'That's fine, they can do that, but I am determined to make this change.' In a letter to the Big Six power firms, Mr Miliband warned that if suppliers refused to work with an incoming Labour government to keep prices down, they risked being seen by consumers as 'part of the problem, not part of the solution'. But he dismissed suggestions that his plans were similar to the attempted restructuring of the energy industry in California in 2000, which had to be scrapped amid widespread price rises, power shortages and company insolvencies. 'There are bound to be people coming up with scare stories, the energy companies doing that, including about California,' said the Labour leader. 'California was a totally different approach. It was a deregulated approach, not the kind of approach we are talking about.' Last . week it emerged energy bills have almost  doubled since 2000, turning . up the heat on Britain’s already hard-pressed families. Farewell: The Labour conference finishes in Brighton today, with deputy leader Harriet Harman giving the traditional closing speech . Kiss: Mr Miliband was joined on the stage by his wife Justine who has enjoyed a much higher profile at this year's conference . Mr Miliband’s plan comes in a week when he has lived up to his Red Ed nickname by telling Labour activists he is ‘bringing back socialism’. And in a confident speech at the party’s conference yesterday he set out a defiantly socialist platform, saying that if he won power in 2015 he would: . The speech delighted the Left, and Len McCluskey, the militant leader of Unite, the country’s largest union and Labour’s biggest financial backer, declared: ‘There wasn’t anything you couldn’t like.’ Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock, pictured in the front row of the Brighton conference clapping and cheering, said Mr Miliband’s vision was ‘brilliant’. In a speech shot through with attacks on David Cameron and George Osborne as out of touch with working people, Mr Miliband used the phrase ‘Britain can do better than this’ 17 times to wild applause and repeated standing ovations from Labour activists. He claimed the Prime Minister could never ‘walk in the shoes’ of those who were struggling to get by and would always stand up for the rich and powerful. Attack: Mr Miliband accused big business of a 'race to the bottom' as he pledged to increase the minimum wage and take on rogue employers and landlords . Race to the top: Mr Miliband said he would take on energy companies, train firms and payday lenders who rip people off . Pitch: Mr Miliband became increasingly animated as he delivered his speech to the packed conference hall . He, by contrast, would fight for workers and had confronted vested interests on media regulation and tobacco controls. Mr Miliband claimed a ‘vital link between the growing wealth of the country and your family finances’ had been broken and restoring it was his ‘central purpose’. Mr Cameron, he said, was ‘going on a lap of honour’ having started to turn the economy around but should instead be doing a ‘lap of shame’ for delivering the slowest recovery in 100 years. ‘Britain can’t win a race for the fewest rights at work against the sweat shops of the world,’ he insisted. Looking left: Many of the policies unveiled by Mr Miliband were seen as stridently left-wing . ‘They used to say a rising tide lifts all boats. Now the rising tide just seems to lift yachts.’ He also promised his government would build 200,000 homes a year by 2020, and suggested councils would be given powers to override the objections of neighbouring authorities seeking to block development. He said Labour would allow the compulsory purchase of land that has planning permission but has not been developed. Mr Miliband spared the Liberal Democrats, prompting speculation he is leaving the door open to a future power-sharing deal with them. Labour says the power bills policy would save households an average of £120 over two years while costing energy firms £4.5billion. Strident: In what was seen as one of the most left-wing speeches by a mainstream leader for decades, Mr Miliband vowed to seize land from developers and fix energy prices . Cheers: The speech, delivered without notes, was given a rapturous reception in the conference hall .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A spelling error by hospital staff meant they missed a crucial chance to help a troubled mother who later killed herself. NHS workers made a tiny keyboard mistake that left them unaware of Marie Natalie Piner’s long history of depression. The records that would have shown her mental health issues were missed, and the young mother was discharged. Marie Natalie Piner was found dead after she was discharged from hospital. A spelling blunder by NHS staff meant they were unaware of her long history of depression . The 36-year-old was later found dead in a car in her home town of Clacton, Essex after taking an overdose of prescription pills. The . computer system used at the hospital at the centre of the incident has . now been revamped following the death, an inquest heard. The hearing was . told that staff at Colchester General Hospital saw Mrs Piner on . November 27 last year. They inputted her maiden name L’Aimable on a . computer – but left off the vital apostrophe. The mistake meant her long history of treatment for depression did not appear on screen. She was still referred to mental health staff, who carried out an assessment but then discharged her. Just . weeks later on December 8 last year, Mrs Piner was reported missing . after she phoned her daughter and a friend, warning them that she had . large amounts of pills and intended to take them all. The . disappearance sparked a major search involving a police helicopter and . lifeboats. Mrs Piner was found dead four days later in a Mercedes C180 . in a Clacton car park. A . toxicology report showed she had a fatal amount of the prescription . opiate Tramadol in her system. A spokesman for North Essex Partnership, . which carried out the mental health assessment, said a revamped computer . system is set to go live from October. Changes mean that slight mistakes on spellings will still yield search results. The . spokesman said: ‘Mrs Piner was referred for assessment in November 2012 . following treatment in a general hospital setting, but under her maiden . name L’Aimable and unfortunately without the apostrophe. ‘During her assessment she did not disclose her previous psychiatric history. ‘Regrettably . the consequence was that at the end of her mental health assessment, . with the information available, and with Mrs Piner’s agreement, no . further support was required from the Trust at that time.’ Essex assistant coroner Eleanor McGann ruled the death was a suicide as a result of an overdose.

"By . Emma Paker Bowles . This sucks: Emma Parker Bowles tries leech therapy in the hope that it will cure her migranes . They undulate through the water in their glass bowl, the shiny black shapes glinting as they catch the light. And when I peer closely at the leeches, I am sure they writhe and wriggle faster – excited as they sense me, their next meal. These bloodsuckers are about to be put on my face. Their ‘keeper’, Alicja Kolyszko, puts her tweezers in the water to catch one. ‘They are very hungry,’ she says in her jolly Eastern European accent. ‘You are going to be their last supper!’ I am drawn to things dark and gruesome. And it doesn’t get much more gruesome than having bloodsuckers attached to your personage. Dear Lord, what have I let myself in for? As Alicja advances towards me, with a long black slimy creature wriggling in the grip of her tweezers, I remind myself just how bad my migraines are, and how I would go to any lengths to get rid of them. The word headache doesn’t even begin to describe them – as the eight million Britons who suffer from migraines will no doubt agree. Migraines are miserable with bells on – actually, the idea of listening to the sound of a bell with a migraine brings me out in a sweat. When I am suffering with one, I can’t even stand the sound of my sheets rustling. Apart from the intense throbbing, all-encompassing pain in my head, I also feel extremely nauseous and sensitive to light. I feel as if I am a vampire – a small sliver of daylight and POOF: I will spontaneously combust. But don’t just take my word for it: severe migraine attacks are classified by the World Health Organisation as among the most disabling illnesses, comparable to dementia, quadriplegia and psychosis. I had my first migraine at boarding school when I was 15. It was a hot summer, and when the school gardener got going with his lawnmower outside my window, I literally wanted to die. Oddly, I didn’t have another one until my 20s and since then they have struck sporadically – I could go for six months without suffering, then there would be a whole week of agony. Say hello to my little friend: ¿Hirudotherapist¿ Alicja shows Emma the leeches which are about to be places on her face to feast on her blood . Some find there are triggers: hormonal cycles, stress, red wine. But mine hit me without rhyme or reason. Which is why I decided to give leech therapy, or hirudotherapy – to give the treatment its correct medical term – a go. As a believer in alternative medicine, I wanted to try something natural and holistic that didn’t involve days spent downing industrial-strength analgesics. I remembered reading about Demi Moore having leech therapy at a clinic in Austria last year. The actress had the treatment to ‘detoxify her blood’ as part of an alternative beauty therapy. ‘I have always been somebody looking for the cutting edge of things that are optimising your health and healing,’ she said afterwards. If it’s good enough for Demi, it’s good enough for me, I thought. Living in Los Angeles now, I have seen Demi in the flesh. Up close, believe it or not, she is a natural beauty, very un-Hollywood. No fillers or collagen that I could detect. So if the leeches could do things for my appearance as well as my health, then all the better. And before you put me and Demi in a box marked ‘Complete loons’, it seems modern medicine is also looking to this rather medieval practice as a solution for a host of ailments. Vampire weekend: Alicija careful places the leaches on Emma's face to start the migrane treatment . In the 1980s, leeches began to be used by reconstructive plastic surgeons needing to remove stagnant blood from reattached limbs, to stave off gangrene. But now there are numerous studies into medical uses for leeches. One found that a single session of leeching – the medical application of bloodsucking leeches – can significantly reduce knee pain caused by arthritis for at least two months. Researchers from the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany claimed improvement levels were comparable to those achieved with daily moderate doses of painkillers such as ibuprofen. And before you say you’d probably rather pop a pill, consider the damage regularly taking painkillers can do to the stomach. Bloodletting is the withdrawal  of quantities of blood from a patient to cure or prevent illness and disease. Evidence of the practice dates back 3,000 years to Ancient Egypt. It was widespread in mid-19th Century Britain, when six million leeches were imported each year for this purpose. Though doctors recommended it – fevers, apoplexy and headaches were thought to be caused by ‘too much blood’ – barbers carried out the procedure. Leeches – parasitic worms that feed on blood – were used as an alternative to just cutting the patient’s arm to release blood. The withdrawal of enough blood to induce syncope (fainting) was considered beneficial, and many sessions would end only when the patient began to swoon. Bloodletting was discredited at the end of the 19th Century as doctors felt it left patients weak and prone to infection, but it has had a recent resurgence, with a wave of celebrities trying it. Another clinical trial at the university is investigating whether nerve pain caused by shingles could also be remedied by leeching. The secret is in the leeches’ saliva: it apparently contains a large number of analgesic, anaesthetic, and blood-thinning compounds that tackle pain and inflammation, say the researchers. Google led me to Alicja, a Russian/Polish hirudotherapist with ten years’ experience. She is based in Las Vegas and New York but she has clients from all around the world. Her passion for natural medicine goes back to her childhood in 1960s Poland, where leeches were used as a popular ‘country healing method’ to cure various health problems. Back then, Kolyszko reminisces, leeches were sold at many pharmacies. Her grandmother would bring one home whenever any family member got sick, pop it on for an hour, and everything would be better. I called her and within five minutes I was swept away by her passion for leeches, or ‘black pearls’, as she describes them. These aren’t your common-or- garden leeches (there are more than 700 species that live wild in freshwater and marine environments – one once attached itself to my buttock while I was bathing in the Mekong river in Cambodia). Medicinal leeches are specially . cultivated in a sterile environment. The largest leech farm in the world . – Biopharm in Hendy, South Wales – was established in 1812, moving to . its current base in 1984. Alicja . has treated people with all sorts of conditions and illnesses, from . infertility to heart conditions to alopecia, and even runs a . hirudotherapy training school. She . says the secretions from leeches’ saliva can be used to treat the . entire spectrum of physiology: blood-clotting, digestion, connective . tissue, disease, pain, inhibition of enzymes, and as a treatment for . inflammation. Go with the flow: An illustration showing a doctor performing bloodletting on a man . Armed with this information, and her assurance that she had helped many migraine patients live pain-free, I find myself reclining on my living-room sofa waiting for a leech to bite into me for the first time. It is – how can I put it politely? – an unusual experience. For a start, when they sense (I am told, smell) flesh, they wiggle and crane their heads toward you. But the worst part is the anticipation. It’s like getting an injection – the sensible thing is not to look at the needle, though I find it impossible not to. And so it is with the wriggling leech. Just before it bit into me, I could feel its cold and slimy body against my temple. But once it actually did, I was relieved that it felt like no more than a mild sting – the leech secretes an anaesthetic that numbs the skin, otherwise the pain would be unbearable. Botox is a million times worse. Once Alicja is sure the leech has got to work, then it’s time for the next one, and the one after that, until you have four attached to you. You can definitely feel them working – it is a mild tugging sensation. I know this sounds extraordinary, but I felt incredibly relaxed. The treatment takes about 40 minutes, until the leech is full and falls off, leaving a mark in the shape of a peace sign. They swell to about four times their normal size, as they become gorged with blood. Once the leeches have done their job, Alicja sends them off to leech heaven by putting them in alcohol (she says it upsets her every time) as reusing them would risk cross-infections. The few hours after the treatment are not for the squeamish – as you do continue to bleed. The next day, I felt exhausted but wonderful. Within a few days, the wounds scab and disappear. To get the most out of hirudotherapy, you need about three sessions within weeks of each other. I have not had a migraine since that first session. More than that, I feel rejuvenated. Leeches really are miracle workers. I am a total convert.","Writer Emma Parker Bowles cures her headaches with leeches .

"By . Emma Thomas . If all you want for Christmas is to be 20 again, it could be possible one day as scientists claim to have found the secret to eternal youth. Experts believe they may be able to turn back the clock as much as 40 years after identifying a natural compound proven to rewind the effects of old age in mice. A protein found in all living cells called NAD could be the key to slowing down the ageing process or reversing it altogether. Harvard: A protein found in all living cells called NAD could be the key to slowing down the ageing process . Tests on two-year-old mice who had been given the NAD-producing compound for just one week had body tissue which resembled that of a six-month old. Professor David Sinclair, an expert in genetics at Harvard Medical School said: 'In human years, this would be like a 60-year-old converting to a 20-year-old in these specific areas.' The compound works by restoring communication between energy cells within the body which have broken down as we get older. Prof Sinclair added: 'The ageing process we discovered is like a married couple - when they are young, they communicate well, but over time, living in close quarters for many years, communication breaks down. 'And just like with a couple, restoring communication solved the problem. 'There’s clearly much more work to be done here, but if these results stand, then many aspects of ageing may be reversible if caught early.' Mice: Tests on two-year-old mice who had been given the compound for one week had tissue which resembled six-month old . His team are now looking at the longer-term outcomes of the NAD-producing compound in mice and how it affects the mouse as a whole. They are also exploring whether the compound can be used to safely treat rare diseases or more common diseases such as Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Longer term, the professor plans to test if the compound will give mice a healthier, longer life.Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, said: 'This is an intriguing and exciting finding that some aspects of the ageing process are reversible. 'It is however a long and tough way to go from these nice mouse experiments to showing real anti-ageing effects in humans without side effects.' The findings were published in the journal Cell.","Harvard Medical School made the discovery .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Forty-somethings who can't afford to rent or buy a home on their own are turning to flatshares with people half their age, new figures reveal. The combination of divorce and rising house prices are said to be to blame for a massive rise in middle-aged people looking to rent rooms in a Friends-style house full of strangers. Websites for would-be flat-sharers say the number of people aged 40-plus looking for rooms has surged in the last five years, with one reporting a doubling of enquiries from over-40s since 2009. Friends: A decade ago, the US sitcom portrayed 20-somethings sharing, but now the over-40s are doing it, too . Matt Hutchinson, of Spareroom.co.uk, said: 'One in eight wanted ads on our website comes from the over-40s, which equates to 60,000 people that age looking for rooms in the past year. 'That figure has gone up from 40,000 five years ago, representing a 50 per cent increase.' He said: 'The reasons for them wanting to share a room is split between those whose relationships have broken down and those who can't afford to get onto the property ladder. 'Our society is geared towards couples - it is the same price to rent or buy a one-bedroom flat for a couple or a person on their own, so for someone newly-single in their 40s, it is very difficult to afford to live on their own.' Given that the average age of people using his site is 28, it means the older flat-sharers may end up living with people half their age. Mr Hutchinson said that while the number of advertisements posted by 40-somethings had soared, he believed the true figure of those looking to share accommodation was far higher. He said: 'Some 40-somethings are too embarrassed to post an ad, fearing their age might put potential flat-mates off. 'Instead, they just respond to ads, hoping that once they've met the younger flat-mates, they will see that they will all get on.' House prices are rising, so now even the middle-aged are finding it hard to get onto the property ladder . Rishi Patel, of Easyroommate.co.uk, said his website had also noticed more middle-aged people flat-sharing. He said: 'We've noticed a growing number of people in their 40s and older choosing to flat-share, and the number of 40-plus renters registered with us now accounts for 13 per cent of the total number of people searching for a room.' He said marriage break-ups and financial constraints were a factor, but said they also attributed it to older renters having to work in London while their family live outside the capital. 'Nearly a quarter of all our 40-plus flat-sharers are searching for a room in London where they work during the week, and they then go back and spend the weekends with their families' he said. Mr Patel said the current average flat-share rent across the UK was £390, while the average rent was £745. He said: 'The vast different in asking prices clearly shows why growing numbers of people are choosing to flatshare instead of live alone.' Mr Patel said that as long as property prices - to buy or to rent - continue to increase, he predicts that flatsharing will continue to grow in popularity.","Flat-sharing websites report a 50 per cent increase in middle-aged sharers .

"By . Ashley Collman . The New Jersey woman who was impregnated five times by her father, an award-winning music video director, is writing a memoir about her childhood abuse. From the age of 10, Aziza Kibibi (now 35) was treated as a sex slave by her father Aswad Ayinde, a music-video director who won fame producing The Fugees' 'Killing Me Softly' music video. But after being convicted of abusing Kibibi and one of her sisters, Ayinde is now behind bars with a 90-year sentence. Despite being abused by her father, and treated like the other women by her mother, Kibibi has overcome her dark past and plans to put the whole thing behind her by publishing a memoir. Scroll down for video . Sharing her story: Aziza Kibibi, 35, plans on publishing a memoir about her dark childhood. Her father started raping her at the age of 10 and she eventually went on to have four children out of incest . 'The number one solution for ending something that is dark is to bring it to light,' Kibibi said in a fundraising video. Locked up: Her father, Aswad Ayinde, now faces a combined 90 years in prison for the sexual abuses he committed against two of his daughters . Kibibi recently started a campaign on Indiegogo to raise 19,000 to self-publish her book, titled  Unashamed. It took her three years to write the 410 page manuscript about  her polygamous family upbringing. She says she wants to share her story in order to 'raise awareness and lend a voice to those that are and have been abused'. The book is set to be published next June. Kibibi also recently won a $10,0000 college grant from Soroptimist, a female empowerment organization. 'Many of the women that have received the grant have overcome enormous obstacles including poverty, sexual and domestic violence, the death of a spouse, and substance abuse,' Soroptimist said in an announcement. The grant will help Kibibi finish college. She is currently attending Essex County College. Last August, Kibibi shared the story of her tumultuous childhood with NJ.com. Her early life was relatively normal. She lived with her mother and father on the third-floor of an apartment in Paterson, New Jersey, with her Jamaican immigrant grandparents living below. Kibibi was home-schooled but still allowed to play with the neighborhood children. When her family grew to include eight children they moved into a bigger apartment in the same building. Double life: Kibibi's father became famous for directing the music video for The Fugees' song 'Killing Me Softly' It was when Kibibi started to mature that her father started giving her unwanted attention. 'He told me I was special. Initially, it was to teach me to be a woman,' she said. 'By the time he started having intercourse with me, he was getting more and more violent. When I would start fighting him, he would hit me. It was more about threats.' Her father began to change, and became more controlling over the family. He moved them out of their grandparent's apartment to another house in Paterson before relocating to Eatontown in Southern New Jersey. The children were only allowed to watch a small amount of TV, and nothing that depicted traditional family life. Modern medicine was outlawed in the house, and he actually told his wife that his relations with Kibibi were to treat her eczema. Getting her degree: Kibibi recently won a $10,000 scholarship to finish college from a female empowerment organization. She currently attends Essex County College . Kibibi wasn't the only one Ayinde was having sex with. He had a mistress - a Manhattan lawyer whom he had another two children with - and was also abusing one of Kibibi's sisters. He called himself a polygamist and a prophet. His family was allowed to pray to god but could only do so through him. 'He said the world was going to end, and it was just going to be him and his offspring and that he was chosen,' his ex-wife, Beverly Ayinde testified at a 2010 pre-trial hearing. She said he was attempting to create a 'pure' bloodline by procreating with his daughters. When Kibibi's first child was born without defects, Ayinde took it as proof and continued to rape the girl to get her pregnant. Damaging: Kibibi gave birth to five children by her father, and many of them inherited a rare genetic disorder due to inbreeding . But the following children would not be . so lucky. Two further daughters born from her father would be diagnosed . with phenylketonuria (PKU) a disease that prevents the body from . breaking down amino acids. PKU can cause brain damage and seizures. Dr. Anna Haroutunian, a PKU specialist who has treated Kibibi's children, said they definitely got the disease because of inbreeding. PKU is a recessive gene, so both parents must have the gene in order for it to pass along to the child. The gene only appears at a rate of 1 in 4,000 world wide and is much lower for African-Americans. Likely Kibibi's paternal grandfather had the gene. Over the years, Kibibi became obsessed with escaping. She would sleep just because her dreams were better than real life. Saved: When she was younger, Kibibi would dream of escaping her father. Eventually she did when she brought her sick son to a hospital and triggered a social worker to step in . 'I'd dream about running away. I'd dream about getting all my brothers and sisters â€” one of my sisters was a baby, and I was taking care of her â€” I'd dream about growing breasts and getting milk and running away with them somewhere,' she said. When she was older and one of her sons fell sick, she finally got the courage to take him to the hospital since Ayinde was out of town on a business trip. But she didn't know how to interact with the doctors and a social worker stepped in, alerting the Department of Youth and Family Services. When Ayinde returned from his business trip he was enraged, and threatened to forcibly remove his son from the hospital. Child services stepped in before he could do that and placed them in separate homes. Ambition: In addition to attending school, Kibibi runs her own bakery business . After that Kibibi, her mother and her sisters moved away from Ayinde as she attempted to get her children back. Her performance in state-mandated courses and counseling impressed the government officials and eventually her children were returned to her. 'She has been an exceptional mother,' Haroutunian said. 'She was so attentive and patient, it's remarkable. For a young girl - with all she's had - she has been just wonderful.' Having to fight to get her children back also empowered Kibibi, and translated to her life after abuse. She now lives in East Orange, New Jersey with her husband. Defects: When Kibibi's first child was born without defects, Ayinde took it as a sign that he was creating a 'pure' bloodline . She went back to school for her GED and will finish her liberal arts degree from Essex County College this fall. She also runs her own baking business and plans to start a restaurant someday. Kibibi and her sister decided to finally bring charges against their abusive father. They delayed pressing charges since they were unsure the affect it would have on the children. She shared her story in hopes of making a difference with those in a similar situation. 'Instead of just being an experience that I had, maybe this strengthened me. What doesn't break us makes us stronger.'","Aziza Kibibi, 35, was raped by her father Aswad Ayinde starting at the young age of 10 .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Crews searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet launched a targeted underwater hunt for the plane's black boxes, with just days left before the devices' batteries are expected to run out. The Australian navy ship Ocean Shield, which is dragging a towed pinger locator from the US Navy, and the British navy's HMS Echo, which has underwater search gear on board, will converge along a 150-mile track in a desolate patch of the southern Indian Ocean. More planes have also joined the search a day after leaders of the two countries co-ordinating the hunt vowed that no effort would be spared to give closure to the families of those on board. The Boeing 777's data recorders emit a ping that can be detected by the equipment on board the ships. Scroll down for video . U.S. Navy Captain Mark Matthews with the pinger locator which has now reached the remote search area in the Indian Ocean where investigators hope it will pick up a signal from MH370's black boxes . Clinging to hope: A underwater pinger locator (above) which is capable of detecting signals from MH370's black boxes has reached the search zone in the Indian Ocean on board the Australian navy ship Ocean Shield . Race against time: The Boeing 777's data recorders emit a ping that can be detected by the underwater device, but there are only a few days left before the signals stop . But the devices stop transmitting the pings about 30 days after a crash - meaning searchers have only around three days left before the batteries die out. Locating the data recorders and wreckage after that is possible, but incredibly difficult. The area the ships are searching was chosen based on hourly satellite pings the aircraft gave off after it vanished from radar on March 8 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. That information, combined with data on the estimated speed and performance of the aircraft, led them to that particular stretch of ocean, said Angus Houston, the head of a joint agency co-ordinating the search. Listening device: AThe Australian navy ship Ocean Shield (pictured), which is dragging the pinger locator from the US Navy, and the British navy's HMS Echo, which has underwater search gear on board, will converge along a 150-mile track in a desolate patch of the southern Indian Ocean . Teams are searching for two black boxes like this one which investigators hope will reveal what happened on board the doomed flight . 'The area of highest probability as to where the aircraft might have entered the water is the area where the underwater search will commence,' he said. 'It's on the basis of data that only arrived very recently and it's the best data that is available.' Air crews and ships have been searching for weeks for the Boeing 777, but have so far found no trace of the plane. Finding floating wreckage is key to narrowing the search area, as officials can then use data on ocean currents to try and backtrack to the spot where the plane entered the water - and where the coveted data recorders may be. Those devices would provide crucial information about what condition the plane was flying under and any communications or sounds in the cockpit. Despite weeks of fruitless searching, Mr Houston said he had not given up hope something would be found. 'I think there's still a great possibility of finding something on the surface,' he said. 'There's lots of things in aircraft that float.' A Royal New Zealand Air Force crew member looks out for debris from the Malaysia Airlines plane . Mission: Search crews are now looking for the aircraft in the Indian Ocean, around 1,100 miles north of Perth, Australia . Fourteen planes and nine ships were . taking part in today's hunt across an 84,000 square mile expanse of . ocean, about 1,100 miles north-west of Perth, the Joint Agency . Co-ordination Centre overseeing the search said. The . search area has shifted each day, as the investigative team continues . to analyse what little radar and satellite data is available while . factoring in where any debris may have drifted due to ocean currents and . weather. 'I think we've probably got to the end of the process of analysis,' Mr Houston said. 'And . my expectation is that we're into a situation where the data we've got . is the data we've got and we'll proceed on the basis of that.' Location: Mr Anwar said that the government should not have allowed the international search teams to scour the South China Sea as they would have known the plane was not there . He said it was unlikely that any additional pinger locators would join the search any time soon as they are in scarce supply. It comes as the Malaysian opposition leader claimed the missing jet would have been tracked by the country's sophisticated radar system and has accused the authorities of withholding information. Politician Anwar Ibrahim said that when he was the Malaysian finance minister he had personally authorised the installation of the radar, and that the system would have picked up the missing plane changing course. The 66-year-old also suggested it was possible that the Malaysian authorities had colluded in the fate of flight MH370, and said an international committee should take over the investigation into the disappearance of the aircraft. 'I believe the government knows more than us. They have the authority to instruct the air force … or Malaysia Airlines,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 'They are privy to most of these missing bits of information critical to our understanding of this mysterious disappearance of MH370.' Yesterday, Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak flew to Australia for briefings on the search for the Boeing 777 and to meet his Australian counterpart, Tony Abbott, whose country is overseeing the hunt. 'It is a very difficult search - the most difficult in human history. But as far as Australia is concerned, we are throwing everything we have at it,' Mr Abbott said.","Australian navy ship will drag listening device through search zone .

Beauty sensation: Fans of Talia Joy Castellano, who tragically lost her six year battle with cancer last Tuesday, are campaigning for MAC cosmetics to launch a make-up line in her honor . 'She has gone through so much in her life and the one thing she wanted to accomplish is putting her handprints and footprints in the world,' Miss Vennes' letter to MAC reads. 'We should make one of Talia's dreams come true whether she is here with us today or not, because she deserves every second of it.' Some supporters have suggested the beauty giant, who regularly launches limited-edition ranges, could donate part of the proceeds from the 'Talia line' to cancer research. Adrienne Zazulak of Canada wrote: 'Talia is an inspiration. If my makeup purchase could help a childhood cancer charity, in her name, AND achieve one of her dreams? I'd buy that any day.' Hopes and dreams: Just days before the 13-year-old YouTube beauty sensation passed away her mother posted her 'bucket list' of wishes to Facebook and number 62 read: 'Have my own MAC collection' Fulfilling her wishes: The Change.org petition in Talia's memory has garnered 1,437 signatures to date . And Irra core from Oxnard, California, added: 'Lets make this happen for Talia. I don't generally buy MAC, but if you have her collection, I will be a faithful client! And lets help other pediatric cancer patients with some of the profits.' Talia, who suffered from two forms of cancer - neuroblastoma and leukemia - had 74 items on her bucket list, which included giving flowers to a stranger and going to a Justin Bieber concert. 'I don't generally buy MAC, but if you have her collection, I will be a faithful client!' Since she passed away fans have been busy living out her unfulfilled wishes and posting photos to Facebook. An album on Talia's page called #taliasbucketlist shows people doing everything from having cake fights to getting a tattoo and covering a car in sticky notes. 'Talia is everywhere you look and we couldn't be more pleased. And we especially know she is loving all the attention' her family explained the day after she died. They added: 'Thank you for keeping her spirit alive and showing her family that her message and voice will continue to make an impact across the globe.' Talia, who would have turned 14 on August 18, had attracted a large following thanks to her upbeat attitude. Step-by-step: The youngster's YouTube tutorials attracted more than 39million hits . Inspirational eyes:  Talia, who was first . diagnosed with with stage four neuroblastoma cancer on Valentine's Day . in 2007,  said that make-up helped to boost her confidence . She didnâ€™t wear wigs because they made her feel 'fake and 'just not me' and instead used make-up as a confidence booster. Her entertaining beauty tutorials on YouTube went on to attract millions of hits. She explained in one video: 'When I put on my make-up I feel like I can embrace those features that I really like about myself.ore than 759,110 people subscribed to her YouTube page to watch Talia's bubbly and expert tips. 'I feel if someone's looking at me, they're looking at my makeup, not looking at my bald head. I am just trying to make young girls, young adults, adults, anyone, feel beautiful by using makeup.' Thanks to the success of her online how-tos, Talia was able to achieve two of her biggest ambitions. She was invited on the Ellen show, where she was made an honorary CoverGirl and presented with a professional shot advert by host Ellen DeGeneres,another representative of the cosmetics brand. Touching the hearts of many: Talia was made an honorary CoverGirl last year on the Ellen show . Earlier this year, Talia also fulfilled her dream of becoming a fashion designer as she collaborated on a line of clothing for teenagers called That Bald Chick with Los Angeles-based designer, Urbana Chappa. Ms Chappa, who runs a womenswear label called Maison De Urbana, got in touch with Talia after hearing her inspirational story on the Ellen show last fall. She flew to Florida on April 15 to meet the teen at the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando and help bring her design ideas to life. Ms Chappa, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 19 but successfully overcame the disease, explained that meeting Talia was an experience 'I'll never forget.' The news of Talia's death was announced via Facebook on July 16. Perfectly polished: Talia used make-up as a . confidence booster and her upbeat and entertaining video tutorials went . on to attract millions of hits . Barely there: Talia wasn't afraid to show the . effects of chemotherapy, as well as how much fun make-up could be; she . hoped her openness would help other young cancer suffers . A message posted by her mother read: 'It is with a heavy heart that we share with all of you that Talia has earned her wings at 11:22am. Please lift her beautiful soul, her beautiful light to heaven.' Dozens of fans took to Twitter to offer their condolences including Ellen DeGeneres, Miley Cyrus, Kendall Jenner and Justin Bieber. Talia was first diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma cancer, a tumor that develops from nerve tissue in infants and children, on Valentine's Day in 2007 when she was just seven years old. Following chemotherapy, surgery and radiation she was cancer-free for one year but in September 2008 doctors found the disease had spread to a small lymph node near her heart. For the next four years she received various treatments, but after periods of remission the cancer kept on returning to other parts of her body. Messages of condolence: Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres had met the teen numerous times . Great loss: The news of Talia's death has touched thousands of her fans around the world . Last year, on one of her famous YouTube video, she revealed that she had neuroblastoma and leukemia at the same time. Doctors suggested a bone marrow transplant as a possible remedy but Talia decided forgo another painful surgery and enjoy her remaining days. Last summer they estimated she had 12 months left to live. Always looking at things in a positive light, Talia said: 'I've gotten so many benefits from [cancer]. 'Having a YouTube channel, [inspiring] people and having people look up to me . . . the journey of having cancer was amazing. But every journey has an end.'","The 13-year-old's family posted her wish list on Facebook days before she lost her six-year battle with cancer .

"By . Gerri Peev . Interest rates could rise earlier than expected thanks to a growth in employment, putting one million mortgage-holders at risk of losing their homes. A record 30million people are in work and the trend is set to continue, says the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). If unemployment was to fall below 7 per cent, this would prompt the Bank of England to rethink interest rates, governor Mark Carney has said. Household debt crisis: If interest rates rise faster than predicted British households could be put at risk . But a separate study suggests a rise in interest rates could leave one million homeowners in danger of defaulting on their mortgages and other debts. Citizens Advice has warned of a ‘financial ticking timebomb’ if there is even a modest rise in interest rates. Chief executive Gillian Guy said: ‘The rising cost of energy, food and travel has been absorbing any spare income people may have. In some cases there is little or nothing left to cope with larger mortgage repayments.’ Even if rates rise gently from 0.5 per cent to 3 per cent by 2018, 1.12million would spend most of their take-home pay on debt repayments, said the Resolution Foundation think-tank. Big spenders: Most of the UK's household debt is composed of mortgages, with the rest taken up with credit cards, personal lending and payday loans . And if rates rise more quickly to 5 per cent by 2018, two million would be tipped into unsustainable levels of debt. The Resolution Foundation, which based its analysis on Office for Budget Responsibility projections, said: ‘While record low interest rates have reduced current repayment costs, fewer people than we hoped have used this breathing space to pay off their debts.’","A record 30million people are now in work .

"By . Becky Barrow . One in six families have mortgages which are more than four times bigger than their salaries, the Bank of England reveals today. The report highlights the huge gulf in Britain because half of families have no mortgage or only a small loan of less than twice their salary, but 16 per cent have ‘a debt to income ratio above four.’ If a worker earns the average full-time salary of £27,000, this means his or her mortgage is more than £108,000 or, if a couple earn a total of £50,000, their mortgage is more than £200,000. Report: One in six families have mortgages which are more than four times bigger than their salaries . Of those struggling with their mortgage, many are also in negative equity, which means the size of their loan is bigger than the value of their property. The Bank’s quarterly bulletin, published today, reveals one in 25 families are currently in this precarious position, a disaster if they want or urgently need to sell their home. The number of negative equity victims has risen sharply since 2007, the year that the credit crunch struck, when just one per cent were affected to four per cent of households today. To add to the pressure on families, their other debts are also rising. For those who have unsecured debts, such as personal loans, the average amount has jumped by nearly £1,000 over the last year from £5,400 to £6,300 this year. When asked how they feel about their debts, nearly two-thirds of families with large mortgages relative to the value of their homes said they are ‘somewhat or very concerned.’ This only applies to people whose mortgage represents 75 per cent or more of the current value of their property. It comes at a time that the Bank has kept the base rate at 0.5 per cent, the lowest level in its 319-year history, raising fears of how families will cope when interest rates rise. Asked how they would cope if the interest rate on their mortgage rose by 2.5 percentage points but did not get a payrise, one in two families said they would have to ‘cut spending or work longer hours’. Yesterday the Council of Mortgage Lenders said mortgage lending jumped to its highest monthly total last month for six years. In November, around £17billion was handed out in mortgages, which is 30 per cent higher than the same month last year and the highest monthly total amount since November 2007. Homes: The number of negative equity victims has risen sharply since 2007, the year the credit crunch struck . Bob Pannell, the CML’s chief economist, said mortgage lending is still ‘a far cry’ from the pre-credit crunch days because banks and building societies have become so much more ‘risk-averse.’ The pressure on people to buy a home is immense with wages stalling or falling for the last five years, but house prices continuing to rise. Young people are having to take out the largest-ever loans - £119,500 - and earn the highest-ever salaries - £36,460, either on their own or a joint income with a partner - in order to get onto the property ladder, according to the CML. To add to this pressure, house prices are predicted to keep on rising, with little or no chance of pay rising at the same pace. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors predicts house price will rise by eight per cent in 2014, although there will be significant regional variations. In London, prices will rise by 11 per cent, the fastest of the UK regions, compared to only four per cent in Northern Ireland, the smallest rise. Peter Bolton King, global residential director of RICS, said: ‘While the number of new homes being built is now on the rise, it still won’t be anywhere near enough to meet demand. ‘We expect the problem of insufficient housing stock to be the main driver behind price increases over the next twelve months.’","Bank of England report shows huge gulf in Britain .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . John Bishop (pictured with his wife) has become embroiled in an access row at his £2million mansion . Comedian John Bishop has become embroiled in an access row at the grounds of his £2million mansion. Local residents have reportedly complained about being denied access to a route on his land which they were previously allowed access to. A spokesman for Mr Bishop has said the comedian maintains a public footpath at his own expense through the land, but changed the security code on a gate to his driveway, which the previous owner of the property allowed neighbours to have. Mr Bishop, 47, bought the £2.25million ten-bedroom mansion, which is surrounded by 24 acres of landscaped lawns, last year. According to The Sun, a resident has said the previous owner allowed neighbours access. The resident went on to say an application had been put in to the local council. A spokesman for Mr Bishop however has said: 'There is not a dispute about access over John Bishop's land. There is in fact a public footpath within his land, which is signposted and maintained at his expense. 'The dispute is about access to a private drive way and entrance via a gate with a security code. This road is private and has never been public. 'The previous owner allowed neighbours to have the code and enter via that gate. The code was understandably changed for security reasons and not redistributed on the advice of the police. 'The matter is not ""dragging on"" because of Mr Bishop. The facts are that the lead petitioner has refused contact from the council, as he has now moved from the area and as such, cannot claim to be involved. Mr Bishop wants it resolved asap.' Lawyers for Mr Bishop meanwhile have told The Sun: 'Any suggestion our client has lost touch with his working-class roots is both untrue and would be defamatory.' The current home of Mr Bishop, who grew up in a three-bedroom council property, features an inside swimming pool, tennis court and lake with an accompanying island. On Saturday, the Daily Mail reported how Mr Bishop's new family home is the result of his remarkable rise from circuit stand-up comedian to household star who has made millions of pounds through TV appearances, sold-out stadium tours and impressive DVD sales. Bishop’s autobiography How Did All This Happen? has also stormed the bestseller charts with more than 93,000 hardback copies sold since last year. In the book the BBC star describes how he keeps his feet firmly on the ground with the help of a reminder of his less luxurious start in life - the street sign from where he grew up. He describes how his brother Eddie ‘nicked’ the Severn Walk sign from the 1960s estate and presented it to him before a gig with the message: ‘So you don’t forget where you are from.’ The comedian grew up in a three-bedroom council property . Mr Bishop says the sign ‘now hangs in my . kitchen, in pride of place’. He adds: ‘You can’t return to your . childhood, but you don’t have to leave it, either.’ The star says growing up in the estate helped define him along with his sense of humour. Having made his success, Mr Bishop adds he is keen to remain living in Cheshire and not make the move to London. He said in a recent interview: ‘There are socialist elements ingrained in you if you’ve grown up on a council estate; it’s something I’m proud of. But I also don’t feel you should apologise for your success if you have managed to move on to good things. ‘I can’t see any reason to leave. It’s never crossed my mind. I think that if you live in the North of England you are a very, very lucky person. I can’t see myself in Primrose Hill drinking cappuccinos. This is where I belong.’ Mr Bishop gave up his successful job as a pharmaceutical salesman to concentrate on comedy in 2006.","Residents say they were previously allowed access .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Selling a house usually means spending thousands on estate agent fees. But Dave and Liene Penny managed thanks to their two young children making an A4 leaflet with a drawing and a handwritten note asking potential buyers to call their dad. Astonishingly the homemade flyers, solely designed and distributed by eight-year-old Ella and Tomass, six, led to a sale in less than a week. David and Liene Penny, from Tauton, sold their £250,000 house in just six days after their two eldest children, Ella (centre left) and Tomass (centre right) made flyers featuring a sketch of the property and 'daddy's' number . Ella, eight, and her six-year-old brother Tomass made the flyers after finding out about the move, then posted them door-to-door and handed them out at a bring-and-buy sale . The leaflet, coloured in with felt . tip, asks that if the person reading it knows anybody who wants to buy a . new house, then phone them up and say there is one in French Wier . Avenue for sale. The . unprompted sales technique has saved a grateful Mr and Mrs Penny some . £4,500 in estate agent fees – and boosted their chances of securing the . £400,000 five-bedroom dream home they hope to buy. The . couple had put in an offer but were worried the move would be . jeopardised by waiting to sell their four-bedroom terraced house. After . being told the situation Ella and Tomass decided to make 40 leaflets . which they distributed door to door to neighbours in Taunton, Somerset, . and at a bring-and-buy sale. They . also put a cardboard box outside their house for people to leave . contact details. Within four days Mr and Mrs Penny had two offers for . the full £250,000 asking price. Thanks to the childrens' flyers (right), David and Liene saved themselves £4,500 in estate agent fees . The children even made a 'For Sale' sign, rating the house at five stars and listing 'places in the house'. They also made a cardboard letter-box for buyers to put their contact details into . Two . days later, without an estate agent in sight, a sale was agreed, and . the family are looking forward to moving into their new house in the . town by the end of the month. Mrs Penny, 32, who also has a two-year-old . son Alex with her financial adviser husband, 47, said: ‘I think as . adults we are too shy to be quite as bold, but not the children and it . paid off. We are very proud.’ The . mini estate agents were treated to a meal out as a reward. Ella said: . ‘It was great when two people wanted to buy our house.’ Tomass added: ‘We spent an hour making everything. I might be an estate agent one day.’ One of the leaflets was handed to a couple at the bring-and-buy sale who passed it to friends at church who were desperate to buy a home in the area near their daughter. The retired couple arranged a viewing - just hours before another hopeful left his contact details in the homemade box - and fell in love with the property. After just four days of handing out the leaflets David and Liene recieved two offers for the full £250,000 asking price for their three-bed home in Taunton (pictured) The family are now looking forward to moving into this £400,000, five-bedroom house across town - which will allow Ella, Tomass, and their two-year-old brother Alex, to have their own rooms for the first time . They immediately put in an offer which was accepted by Liene and Dave, 47, a financial adviser. The new buyers, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: 'Our friends were so impressed with the politeness and sweetness of the two children. 'The next day she gave us the leaflet at church and we were impressed by it too. The rest, they say, is history.' As well as saving their parents time, the enterprising children have also saved £4,500 in estate agency fees - 1.5 per cent of the sale price plus 20 per cent VAT.","David and Liene Perry made an offer on a new £400,000 home in January .

"By . Luke Garratt . Parents of a young girl were stunned when they were told by hospital staff their daughter would have to get the train home after having brain surgery. Caroline Zaple-Davies, 50, and husband Simon, said there was no way their 13-year-old daughter Katie was well enough to travel on the train minutes claiming she had only come out of surgery minutes before. Katie from Torquay, Devon suffers from a brain tumour, has had several operations at Frenchay Hospital, Bristol in the past and the hospital has always provided transport home. Caroline Zaple-Davies (left) and husband Simon (right) were outraged when their 13-year-old daughter Katie, who suffers from a brain tumor, was told to take the train home after a surgery . On Thursday March 27 she was taken by hospital transport to Frenchay for another operation scheduled that day. A delay caused the procedure to be pushed back to Saturday March 29, and afterwards the surgeon told her she was well enough to go home. But instead of organising transport, which had been provided for her before, they told her the train was the best option. Katie's brain tumor told has caused her to have several surgeries in the past . Mother Caroline, 50, who was at the hospital, said: 'I was just sat by the bed when I presume a Sister dressed in dark blue came into the ward and said, ""is there anything I can do for you?"" 'I said we'd come up in ambulance transport and we'd be needing some transport back to Torquay. 'Straight away she said, ""no we don't do transport back."" 'I said ""but we went up in the ambulance so how were we expected to get back?"" 'She said that there was always the train. 'I was horrified when she said it - I thought she was joking. 'Bearing in mind Katie had just had surgery and the main rail line at Dawlish was out of action at that time. 'I explained that to her and she said, ""I suppose it's not ideal."" 'Katie was in bed listening to all this. 'She's been hospital lots and lots of times and she heard that she had to go home on the train - I just think it's not on.' Katie's father Mr Davies added they always had transport provided previously when she'd been in for surgery. He said: 'Last time she went in the hospital provided a taxi. The time before that it was a hospital transport. And the time before that was hospital transport too. Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, has always provided transport in the past after Katie has had a surgery . 'I mean she can hardly move her head after surgery. It's not fair - there's no compassion. It takes the biscuit.' Simon who has sight problems and couldn't drive them home managed to arrange a taxi for Katie and Caroline at a cost of over Â£100. The hospital said they were looking into the incident but say that because it was the weekend providing transport may have been more difficult. Frenchay Hospital claims that because the surgery took place on the weekend, they couldn't provide transport. They did offer to provide reimbursement for costs to travel home . Mrs Zaple-davies said: 'I don't think that's acceptable.Katie was diagnosed when she two. 'We've done lots and lots with her - I just feel let down.' A spokesman for Frenchay said they were disappointed the family was unhappy, but that it wasn't possible to organise transport because it was the weekend. They also said they'd offered to sort it out on the Monday and reimburse them the cost of the taxi fare.","Katie Zaple-Davies, 13, was only minutes out of her latest brain surgery .

"By . Becky Barrow . It used to be the heart of any family home. But kitchens are shrinking as the appetite for eating out grows. The average Londoner now eats out nearly four times a week, copying a trend established by New Yorkers, according to the latest Zagat survey of restaurants in the capital. It used to be the heart of any family home. But kitchens are shrinking as the appetite for eating out grows . Today an exclusive report, from the estate agency, Marsh & Parsons reveals how the eating out trend is influencing the size of people’s kitchens, also being cut back by the crippling cost of property in the capital. Overall, it estimates the average kitchen has shrunk by a third since the 1960s, a time when families traditionally ate at home and prepared each meal themselves from scratch. The report says the kitchen is ‘shrinking dramatically in size and prominence’ in London homes, claiming it is ‘falling victim to the changing eating habits of modern-day Londoners.’ In fact, the kitchen accounts for a smaller proportion of the total living space in new-build developments and conversions in the capital than ever before. Charles Holland, a director of Marsh & Parsons, said: ‘Kitchen size is no longer as important to many young professional buyers. ‘It is often at the bottom of the pile in their property wish list.’ He added: ‘Aware of the changing lifestyle of our capital’s young professionals, developers of the latest London apartment blocks are prioritising living space, bathrooms and nearly all else over kitchen size.’ Overall, it estimates the average kitchen has shrunk by a third since the 1960s, a time when families traditionally ate at home and prepared each meal themselves from scratch . It recently sold a two-bedroom flat in a development in Barnes, south-west London, with a kitchen which is roughly half the size of an average car parking space. For some homeowners, it is because their property is so small that there is no room for anything other than a very compact kitchen. The average size of new-build one bedroom home in the UK is just 46 square metres, the size of one Jubilee Line carriage on the London Underground, according to the Royal Institute of British Architects. A recent investigation by the institute found many families have no space to store large supermarket shops, particularly if they bought promotions, such as buy-one-get-one-free. One woman said: ‘I buy lots of stuff in Tesco. If it is buy-one-get-one free crisps, then we just leave it in the car.’ Others used their garage or loft, rather than their cramped kitchen. For others with larger homes, the kitchen is no longer a separate room, but part of a larger living space, often billed by estate agents as a ‘family living area’. The average Londoner now eats out nearly four times a week . One flat in Pimlico, also in south-west London, was recently sold for £895,000 with a small galley kitchen squeezed into the corner of a huge living room. Peter Rollings, chief executive of Marsh & Parsons, said: ‘With less and less time spent preparing meals in the home, we are starting to see the kitchen completely disappear as a room in its own right.‘It is being subsumed into the wider living and dining space. ‘Looking to the future, it begs the question whether the London kitchen is about to do a disappearing act on us altogether, or whether it has already ceased to exist as a must-have space?’ Companies now sell ‘hideaway’ kitchens which look like a piece of furniture, but open up to reveal all that you need for a basic kitchen. Others are just ‘mini’ kitchens which take up a tiny amount of space. One firm, called John Strand, sells a one-metre wide ‘hideaway kitchen’ with a sink, a drainage area, a fridge and freezer, some storage shelves and a microwave. Calvin Reeves, managing director of John Strand, said his company’s ‘mini’ or ‘hideaway’ kitchens have become increasingly popular in recent years. Mr Reeves said: ‘In central London, property developers are converting more and more properties into studios and one-bedroom apartments. ‘This is because the way that people are living now - it is more about getting their food conveniently, rather than having the time to prepare it themselves.’ It is not just young professional couples who find their kitchens appealing, but also parents who want to make a room in their home into a ‘self-contained’ space where their grown-up child or elderly parent can live and enjoy some independence..","The average Londoner now eats out nearly four times a week .
