"Tributes are flowing in for much-loved British actor and comedian Rik Mayall, who died in London Monday at age 56. Mayall, one of the leading lights of Britain's alternative comedy scene in the 1980s, is best known for starring roles in hit TV series ""Blackadder,"" ""The Young Ones,"" ""The New Statesman"" and ""Bottom."" His agent, Kate Benson, of Brunskill Management, told CNN Mayall died suddenly Monday; she did not know the cause of his death. Mayall first found widespread fame in student sitcom ""The Young Ones,"" which ran for two years on the BBC, and was later shown on MTV in the United States. The series, which he co-wrote, focused on the lives of four roommates at ""Scumbag College."" Mayall played politics-obsessed poet Rick alongside his long-term comedy partner Ade Edmondson as violent punk Vyvyan. Edmondson led the tributes to Mayall Monday, telling Britain's Press Association news agency: ""There were times when Rik and I were writing together when we almost died laughing. ""They were some of the most carefree, stupid days I ever had, and I feel privileged to have shared them with him. And now he's died for real. Without me. Selfish bastard."" Writer and comedian Ben Elton told the Press Association Mayall had ""changed his life"" by asking him to work on ""The Young Ones."" ""He always made me cry with laughter, now he's just made me cry."" In cult favorite ""Blackadder"" -- also co-written by Elton -- Mayall was memorably cast in the guest role of the womanizing Lord Flashheart, who steals the anti-hero's fiancé from under his nose -- at the altar. His lines were regularly repeated in schoolyards and student pubs. In the 1990s, he reunited with Edmondson for ""Bottom,"" a slapstick-filled series about two unemployed flatmates who spend most of their time attacking each other violently with anything that comes to hand; the pair are reported to have come up with the idea for the show while starring in a production of Samuel Beckett's nihilistic ""Waiting for Godot."" On Twitter, writer Hugo Rifkind suggested that fans of the show should pay homage to Mayall in true ""Bottom"" style: ""Go home tonight, find someone you love, and hit them with a frying pan."" Mayall also branched out into movies, taking the lead role in 1991's ""Drop Dead Fred,"" in which he played the imaginary friend of Phoebe Cates, returning years later to wreak havoc in the now grown-up Cates' life. Mayall survived a near-fatal quad bike accident in 1998; he was in a coma for five days after the crash, on his farm in Devon, southwest England, and developed epilepsy as a result of the severe head injury he suffered when he was crushed under the bike. In an interview several years later, he joked that he ""beat Jesus"" by coming back from the dead after so long. In 2006, he told Britain's Observer newspaper: ""I was dead for five days. Jesus was only dead for three, so I beat him -- 17 April 1998 was the day I was sent back from heaven."" He said the accident left him ""more aware of being alive."" House star Hugh Laurie, who worked with Mayall on ""Blackadder,"" took to Twitter to recount a story about his co-star: ""A young girl, stricken with terminal cancer, once asked Rik Mayall for an autograph. He wrote: 'Young Ones are never afraid.'"" People we've lost in 2014 .","British actor and comedian Rik Mayall is dead at 56 .

"It may be a long way from home but it took just two years for a trio of young techies to take their web-based startup from a classroom in Ghana to the world's technology capital, California's Silicon Valley. In November 2011, Ghanaian entrepreneurs David Osei, Kamil Nabong and Philips Effah founded Dropifi, an online tool that helps businesses sort customer feedback online. About 20 months later, it has become the first African company to join the 500 Startups program, a Silicon Valley-based seed accelerator and investment fund. ""I never thought of moving to the Valley as soon as this, because basically we want to build a global startup company right from Ghana that is going to service the whole world,"" says Osei, Dropifi's chief executive. ""But coming to the Valley is definitely a step ahead of what we had imagined."" Read this: 10 African startups you need to know . The team's journey to the world's biggest startup ecosystem started at the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology in Accra, Ghana's capital. ""David approached me and said, 'this is the idea,'"" remembers Effah, Dropifi's chief technical officer. ""He realized that businesses lose a lot of information online because of this long and scary contact form (on their websites). I realized that there is a huge potential for it."" That idea became Dropifi, a widget that seeks to replace what it describes as ""the era of long and scary website 'contact us' forms"" and ""still deliver business-critical insights and a spam-free customer engagement."" The tool helps business monitor customer feedback. It analyzes demographics, industry trends and the emotions behind the messages, to help companies respond effectively to customers. It also taps into social media platforms so companies can have a broader customer reach. ""We have the person's social media profiles online up here,"" says Nabong. ""This gives you different channels that you can even contact people from,"" he adds. ""So I can just go to this person's Twitter profile and tweet to him, or maybe send him a Facebook message, and this makes multichannel communication very easy for you."" Read this: Tech hub working on 'Nigeria's next big idea' The entrepreneurs received their first batch of funding for the company after taking part in the Accra Start-Up Weekend, a competition for entrepreneurs. ""We came out as the winners of it, particularly because we were able to convince about 20 companies in Ghana to become paying clients of the service,"" says Osei. Dropifi also took first place in the Global Start-Up Open Competition in 2012 and won the top prize funded by the U.S.-based Kauffman Foundation. The team flew to Brazil earlier this year to claim that award and it was there that they first met Dave McClure, founder of the 500 Startups program. Osei didn't hesitate to lobby McClure. ""I particularly was impressed by David (Osei) and him coming out to me and trying to pitch me something that was maybe a little bit too much of a long shot,"" recalls McClure.  ""Initially I was really cautious, thinking 'OK, what is this guy is from Africa doing in Rio, trying to pitch me.' Then it was like, well, I'd sort of heard of the accelerator before so we knew they were kind of legit (and) the product offering sounded pretty much on target with our investment philosophy."" Read this: Why tech innovators are Africa's future . About twice a year, 500 Startups picks a group of around 30 companies to fund. It brings them together for a four-month ""boot camp,"" where companies learn everything from marketing strategies to sales tactics, to help them grow their business and attract investors. McClure says this was the program's first direct investment into a company from Africa. ""For some people maybe when you are investing in a new region they are more cautious about that; for us it was an opportunity and we were really excited,"" he explained. Dropifi today has over 6,000 clients in more than 30 countries. The team now hopes to expand their company globally with the skills and knowledge they acquire from their Silicon Valley experience. ""Our immediate goal is building a sustainable product that is going to deliver continuous value to our business,"" says Osei. ""Currently we are focused on the U.S. and international market -- the U.S., UK, Canada -- but in a couple of years we want to become leaders in Africa.""","Dropifi is the first African company to join the Silicon Valley-based 500 Startups program .

"President Barack Obama told three people who repeatedly interrupted his latest speech on immigration to stop their yelling because he ""just took an action to change the law."" Obama was in Chicago on Tuesday night to tout an executive order halting deportations for the undocumented parents of children born in the United States. But -- as has been the pattern in recent months -- he couldn't get through the speech without being heckled by protesters who want bolder action. About 20 minutes into the speech, three women -- one standing four rows behind Obama, holding a sign reading ""Stop Deportations Now,"" and the other two in the crowd -- shouted a series of complaints. RELATED: Obama: 'No sympathy for violence in Ferguson . One called Obama's claim that his immigration policies are focused on deporting felons, not families, ""a lie."" Another said it's ""not just Republicans"" who have called undocumented immigrants felons. Obama told the protesters it ""doesn't make sense to yell at me right now,"" given his immigration action last week. ""What you're not paying attention to is, I just took an action to change the law,"" he said as the crowd applauded. The interruptions continued, with Obama saying at one point that he's ""not going to be able to have a conversation with each of you separately"" and later that they should ""just sit down."" Obama tackles immigration, Ferguson at hometown rally . ""Nobody's removing you. I've heard you. But you've got to listen to me, too,"" he said. Obama's claim that he ""took an action to change the law,"" though, could fuel more complaints from congressional Republicans and governors in states like Texas who have accused the President of overstepping his constitutional bounds. Texas Governor-elect Greg Abbott is readying a legal challenge to Obama's executive order, while GOP lawmakers consider using spending bills this December to cut funding for the agencies that would implement Obama's order. Obama has shot back that House Republicans who object to his action should pass an immigration reform bill; he's endorsed one approved by the Senate in 2013.","President Barack Obama pointed to his immigration executive order as he sought to quiet protesters in Chicago .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Senators have left town for the Thanksgiving holiday, but the Senate will technically stay in session -- a move that keeps President Bush from making appointments while lawmakers are in recess. The Senate will hold ""pro forma sessions"" while lawmakers are gone for the Thanksgiving holiday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said he would schedule ""pro forma"" sessions during the two-week break, even though lawmakers will be absent and no business will be conducted. The sessions are expected to last less than 30 seconds -- the clerk will announce who the presiding officer is, and then that senator will gavel the session closed. The Constitution gives a president the power to fill vacancies without the Senate's confirmation when the legislative body is in recess. Such appointees can serve without confirmation through the rest of the current session of Congress, which ends in January 2009. Bush has used the power before to install nominees whose confirmation Senate Democrats had blocked. The most notable instance came in August 2005 when he angered Democrats by naming John Bolton as U.N. ambassador. ""My hope is that this will prompt the president to see that it is in our mutual interests for the nominations process to get back on track,"" Reid said in a statement. Reid said the Bush administration had informed him that several recess appointments would be made during the Thanksgiving break. At the same time, Reid said the White House has been unwilling to confirm nominations Democratic leaders have made to agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ""I indicated I would be willing to confirm various appointments if the administration would agree to move on Democratic appointments,"" he said. ""They would not make that commitment. As a result, I am keeping the Senate in pro forma [session] to prevent recess appointments until we get this process on track."" Asked Friday if Bush planned on making any recess appointments, White House spokesman Tony Fratto said, ""I have nothing for you on that."" Fratto added, ""We don't talk about or speculate on personnel appointments until we're ready to announce them."" The lawmakers left for their break Friday without passing any major bills that they were trying to get done before the break. An effort to pass a temporary funding bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan stalled on procedural votes. Democratic leaders in the House and Senate -- who want to make the money conditional on setting dates for bringing troops home -- indicated they don't expect to return to the issue until early next year. The White House and congressional Republicans -- who want the money without strings attached -- are pushing for votes in December. The long-sought $286 billion farm bill, which sets the nation's agriculture policies and provides for subsidies to farmers, also stalled on a procedural vote Friday after senators spent two weeks of floor time unable to agree on a set of amendments to the otherwise popular bill. Competing proposals to stave off the effect of the alternative minimum tax from millions of middle-class voters this tax season is stuck in negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, who agree the tax should be abolished but can't agree on how, or whether, to pay for it. The children's health insurance bill known as the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, which Bush vetoed once, is bogged down in the House. House Democrats have been unable to persuade wavering Republicans to agree to a proposal that would expand the program and win enough support to override Bush's veto. There are enough votes to override it in the Senate. Most of the spending legislation Congress was supposed to pass before October will be wrapped into one ""omnibus"" bill to be voted on sometime in December. The Democratic-authored spending bills have been stalled. They are $22 billion more than what Bush said he would agree to spend this year. The White House quickly rejected a proposal from Reid to halve the extra funding to $11 billion. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, floated a counter offer, suggesting Republicans might go along with the extra funding of domestic programs if Democrats agree to pass the war money free of conditions. There has been no official response yet from Democratic leaders, but one Democratic aide said he didn't think his bosses would accept Kyl's proposal.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Defense and diplomacy were on full display when the United Nations secretary-general took to the soccer field in the first U.N. '""DiploMatch."" ""It is very hard at my age to play soccer,"" said the 64-year-old Ban Ki-moon. Typically, a Saturday evening soccer game with mostly middle-aged men wouldn't garner much attention, unless an ambulance is required. But the recent match played between two modest teams of U.N. ambassadors and officials, along with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, was certainly not typical. The mood was competitive yet congenial as the dignitaries traded their suits for shorts and hit the soccer field at Chelsea Piers on a balmy New York evening April 25. ""Soccer is a sport that really can unite the people and generate enormous power and energy among people regardless of where you are coming from,"" Ban said. ""When you follow the balls, you just forget, and you become one team, and you become one nation. This is what we aim to achieve today."" There was, of course, an underlying purpose behind the motivation to hit the pitch: support for a new charitable organization dedicated to advancing peace through the global reach and unifying power of soccer (also called football).  Watch Ban Ki-moon mix it up with diplomats on soccer field » . British U.N. Ambassador John Sawers summed up the rationale motivating the event. ""Soccer's the great world game, and this is [the] United Nations, the great world organization, playing it for charity, so it's a lot of fun."" ""Football for reconciliation"" is the driving purpose of Play31, the organization behind the U.N. game. The group says the sport has the unique potential ""to bring people together, spread joy and to create healing in post-conflict societies."" Its mission statement further explains, ""By donating footballs and facilitating community gatherings, we contribute to the creation of peaceful societies where children can exercise their right to play."" Play31 and ""the right to play"" are derived from Article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The 1989 summit sought to guarantee certain universal rights for children under 18, including ""the right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts."" Jakob Lund, the 26-year-old founder and president of Play31, was inspired to launch his program after spending time in Sierra Leone, a nation ravaged by 11 years of civil strife. ""We use soccer as a facilitator for people meeting each other and for people simply just interacting ... and I think that is something true for football is that it can transcend borders, languages, races, everything that we see can normally divide people -- on the football field, it can unite them, and that's what is so special."" Added the enthusiastic U.N. ambassador from Paraguay, Eladio Loizaga, who contributed two goals in the first half for his team: ""I mean, I didn't expect that! Two goals! I tried to put my best tonight for the children and for the event."" Radhika Coomaraswamy, special representative for children in armed conflict, said, ""there is really something to do with children that really brings the United Nations together."" Ban also emphasized the plight of children as an important priority on the U.N. agenda. ""This is a very small symbolic event, but though it may be small, this will, I hope, demonstrate our solidarity to those people, many young children, who are in war-torn countries, who really want some hope from the international community. I hope this will help."" But even with all the togetherness for a good cause, settling disputes on the pitch versus the halls of the United Nations had to have been a different experience for the ambassadors. Sawers explained, ""these guys I spend my days from Monday to Friday negotiating with, and we have fun on weekends, so this is us having fun."" Chile's Ambassador Heraldo Muñoz, one of the team captains, elaborated. ""Getting out of the U.N. and of negotiations, and speeches ... is quite good. I think it should say something about humanity that we are not only diplomats, but we are also football players and poets and writers."" The other team was led by Ambassador Christian Wenaweser of Liechtenstein. Wenaweser was quite impressed with one particular participant, expressing how he thought the secretary-general's performance was ""amazing."" ""He gave up his right to rest for this, and I think it's amazing. And he played well; he had good positioning, good defense. It was great,"" Wenaweser said. Laughing, Ban responded to reactions about his defensive prowess. ""When the ball comes to me, then I have to defend my team, so that was very, very difficult. But I think I have defended well."" The 64 year-old secretary-general played nearly the entire game, mixing it up with fellow U.N. dignitaries. ""It is very hard at my age to play soccer,"" Ban conceded. ""It's very hard, but I feel very much a sense of full excitement and energy."" Ban's dogged defense clearly made an impact. However, the secretary-general couldn't resist his role as the world's lead diplomat, even on the football field, and changed teams at halftime. Diplomatically, the score was not recorded, although observers said Team Lichtenstein was the victor. Ban played defense the entire time, except when he came off for a couple breathers. When he came off in the first half, the other team quickly scored three goals.","U.N. dignitaries play soccer to support group that promotes peace .

"A large number of people, mostly located in Australia, are reporting they have come under an unexplained attack that holds their iPhones and iPads hostage and demands they pay a $100 ransom. The attack appears to work by compromising iCloud accounts associated with the disabled devices, according to an Apple support forum discussion that started Sunday morning and quickly accumulated several hundred posts. Commandeered devices typically emit a loud tone that's associated with a feature that helps users locate lost or stolen devices. iPhones and iPads also display the message: ""Device hacked by Oleg Pliss. For unlock device, you need send voucher code by 100 usd/eur (Moneypack/Ukash/PaySafeCard) to email:lock404@hotmail.com for unlock."" In some cases—specifically, when a user hasn't assigned a strong passcode to a locked device—it can only be unlocked by performing a factory reset, which completely wipes all previously stored data and apps. The mass compromise is a variation on so-called ransomware scams, which initially targeted Windows PC users and earlier this month were found targeting smartphone users running Google's Android OS. The forum accounts provide strong evidence that victims' Apple IDs and passwords have been compromised so that attackers can remotely lock connected devices using Apple's Find My iPhone service. But so far it remains unclear exactly how the attackers are compromising the iCloud accounts. While it's possible the hijackers used phishing attacks or hacked password databases to obtain the credentials, those explanations are undermined by the observation that the vast majority of victims were located in Australia and reported using a variety of e-mail providers. Typically, phishing campaigns and database compromises involving multiple providers affect users from more geographic regions. DNS poisoning? One participant in the online discussion theorized the mass compromise may have been the result of hacking domain name system (DNS) servers used by Australian service providers to translate human readable addresses such as Apple.com into the IP addresses Internet routers rely on. Such an attack, which has yet to be confirmed in this case, works by ""poisoning"" the lookup tables of DNS servers so they secretly direct people to impostor sites. Assuming this technique was at play in the iPhone and iPad locking, affected users who entered a password on what appeared to be Apple's site could have unknowingly provided it to the people behind the attack. Apple officials have yet to comment on the report. There is no indication the hijackings are the result of any compromise on Apple servers, so that leaves end users to figure out for themselves how to secure their own devices. Readers are once again advised to use long, randomly generated passwords that are unique to their iCloud account. They should also enable two-factor authentication and assign a separate, randomly generated passcode to each iPhone and iPad they own. Readers are reminded they can be permanently locked out of their Apple ID accounts, and possibly their iPhone or iPad when running iOS 7 with Find My iPhone turned on, if they are compromised before two-factor authentication is enabled. Two-factor authentication won't automatically prevent an attacker from compromising an iCloud account, but it will prevent the attacker from changing security questions and other crucial settings in the event of a breach. The identities of the people behind the attack are unknown. There's no indication they have any connection to anyone named Oleg Pliss. People with a locked device should immediately try changing the credentials for their Apple ID and ensure two-factor authentication is set up. In the event their locked device didn't have a passcode associated with it, they can perform a factory reset by using a cable to plug the device into their computer while iTunes is open. More instructions are here.","A large number of users are reporting attacks that hold their iPhones, iPads hostage .

"It's an unimaginable horror.  A 14-year-old girl with special needs allegedly was raped at school after a teacher's aide persuaded her to act as bait to catch an accused sexual predator, a fellow student. ""It has essentially devastated her life,"" attorney Eric Artrip -- who represents the girl and her father -- said of the alleged January 2010 incident. The Department of Justice and U.S. Department of Education filed an amicus brief Wednesday supporting her family's federal lawsuit against the Madison County School Board in Alabama. An amicus brief is a legal argument offered to the court by someone who is not a party to the case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Atlanta will decide whether to accept the argument. ""School administrators knew the student's extensive history of sexual and violent misconduct and were alerted to the substantial risk he posed"" to other students, according to the brief. About a week before the alleged rape, Sparkman Middle School vice principals Jeanne Dunaway and Teresa Terrell received a complaint that the boy had touched a female student inappropriately and was assigned in-school suspension, according to federal attorneys. A few days later, June Simpson, a teacher's aide at the Huntsville-area school, told the principal, Ronnie Blair, that the boy had ""repeatedly tried to convince girls to have sex with him in the boys' bathroom on the special needs students' corridor"" and had actually had sex with one student, according to the brief. The boy and his alleged sexual partner denied having sex in the bathroom, but Simpson recommended the boy be ""constantly monitored,"" according to the brief. Blair said the boy could not be punished because he had not been ""caught in the act,"" the brief reads. School policy requires allegations of student-on-student misconduct be substantiated. Trying to ""catch him in the act"" On January 22, 2010, the boy approached a 14-year-old girl with special needs who had already declined his ""recent, repeated propositions"" for sex, according to the brief. ""She was not physically or mentally handicapped, although she does qualify for special education classes,"" Artrip told CNN. When the girl told Simpson, she encouraged the girl to ""meet (the boy) in the bathroom where teachers could be positioned to 'catch him in the act' before anything happened,"" according to the brief. The girl initially refused, but then agreed, according to Artrip. Simpson and the girl went to Dunaway's office to explain the plan. Dunaway ""did not respond with any advice or directive,"" according to the brief. ""If this was problematic for the administration it would have been better to express that on the front end instead of the back end,"" said attorney McGriff Belser III, who represents Simpson. The girl left Dunaway's office, found the boy in the hallway, and ""agreed to meet for sex,"" according to the brief. ""Something went wrong,"" said Artrip. Instead of meeting in the boys' bathroom on the special needs students' corridor, the boy told the girl to meet him in the sixth-grade boys' bathroom, in another part of the school, according to the brief. ""No teachers were in the bathroom to intervene,"" the brief reads. ""She stalled for time. She continually tried to fight him off but ultimately was anally raped by this young man,"" Artrip told CNN. ""It was evident that this had been a severe trauma for her,"" said Artrip. Police were called and the girl was taken to the National Children's' Advocacy Center in Huntsville, where a rape kit was taken, Artrip told CNN. Medical personnel found evidence of trauma ""consistent with (the girl) being sodomized."" The boy claimed he had only kissed her, according to the brief. Fraternity investigated over 'date rape' drug allegations . Attorneys: Boy had a long history of serious misconduct . The girl was uncommunicative after the incident, Artrip said. The district attorney in Madison County investigated the incident, but with a victim who was unable or unwilling to talk about the incident, the office didn't think they had a good case, and did not pursue it. Even after viewing photographs of the girl's injuries, vice principal Terrell ""testified that she didn't know whether (the girl) had consented to the assault,"" according to the brief. The school listed the alleged rape as ""inappropriate touching a female in boys' bathroom,"" on the student's computerized disciplinary report. He was suspended for five days and sent to an alternative school, but later returned to Sparkman after about 20 days, according to the brief. Vice principal Dunaway testified that the girl was responsible for herself once she entered the bathroom, according the brief. DoJ and DoE attorneys claim the boy had a long history of sexual and other misconduct in school and Sparkman Middle School administrators knew it. Several pages of the 126-page brief detail years of disciplinary problems. The boy had been involved in 15 violent or sex-related proven incidents of misconduct before the alleged rape, according to the brief. Federal attorneys say details about the severity of the incidents are unavailable because school administrators shredded the boy's disciplinary files. The girl's father filed the federal lawsuit in October 2010 against the boy, the three administrators, the teacher's aide and the Madison County School Board. ""We felt, (that) the teacher putting her into this position, because of the policy as interpreted by the school board and the principal, violated Title IX,"" Artrip told CNN. Title IX is a federal law aimed at ending sexual discrimination in education.  In part, it dictates how schools that receive federal funds must respond to claims of sexual harassment. In 2010, a district court judge allowed the father's claims of state violations, including negligence, against Simpson and Dunaway, while dropping the boy from the lawsuit because he was a minor. The judge tossed out the federal claims -- that the school district violated Title IX and that Simpson and school administrators deprived the girl of her civil rights. Both sides have appealed. Schools preach 'enthusiastic' yes in sex consent education . Fighting for a jury trial . According to the rare amicus brief, written in part by an attorney with the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, the school, in its capacity as a recipient of federal funds is ""liable for [its] deliberate indifference to known acts of peer sexual harassment."" On the same day the federal brief was submitted, the Women's Law Project, joined by 32 national and local organizations, submitted a joint brief supporting the family's lawsuit. Earlier this month, the National Women's Law Center and Artrip submitted a joint brief to the Eleventh Circuit. Artrip told CNN his client deserves her day in court and a jury should weigh in on the Madison County District's requirement of substantiation of allegations of student-on-student misconduct. ""We hope that the attention that this case is getting will spur a movement on these kinds of policies so that a girl can simply report sexual harassment without having a need to bring a witness with her or roll up her shirt and show bruises,"" Artrip told CNN. The girl was withdrawn from Sparkman Middle School and underwent extensive counseling. She went to live with her mother in North Carolina, but her mother died soon after. Instead of moving back to Huntsville, she and her brother were placed with Child Protective Services in North Carolina, the attorney said. Geraldine Tibbs, the head of public relations for the Madison County Board of Education, said the board and school officials ""are confident that the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals will rule in favor of the Board and the administrators."" ""Our attorneys recommend that we not discuss ongoing litigation,"" she said. Ronnie Blair and Teresa Terrell are still principal and vice principal at Sparkman Middle School. Jeanne Dunaway is now principal at Madison County Elementary School. June Simpson resigned shortly after the incident. ""My client has gone from being a teacher's aide to being a scapegoat,"" said Simpson's attorney. When asked why his client thought it was a good idea to use a special needs teen as bait to catch a suspected attacker, Besler told CNN, ""I don't personally think it is a good idea.  The events of this case have shown us that it was not.""

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Israel's top general said Monday he did not believe the country's soldiers ""hurt civilians in cold blood"" after newspaper reports quoted soldiers who said the army had treated Gaza as a free-fire zone during its offensive this winter. Israeli soldiers, just back from Gaza, January 17, 2009, along the Gaza-Israeli border in Israel. ""I tell you that this is a moral and ideological army,"" Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, the chief of staff, said in a speech. Israeli soldiers said last week that Palestinian civilians were killed and Palestinian property was intentionally destroyed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to the newspaper Haaretz. About 1,300 Palestinians died during ""Operation Cast Lead,"" which aimed to stop militants from firing rockets into Israel from Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces has said it is investigating the claims. ""I don't believe that soldiers serving in the IDF hurt civilians in cold blood, but we shall wait for the results of the investigation,"" Ashkenazi said. He blamed Hamas, the militant Palestinian group which runs Gaza, for choosing ""to fight in heavily populated areas."" ""It (was) a complex atmosphere that includes civilians, and we took every measure possible to reduce harm of the innocent,"" he said, according to an IDF statement. The accounts in Haaretz are from Israeli soldiers who graduated from a pre-military course at an Israeli college. TheIsraeli soldiers complain in the reports that the rules of engagement often defied logic and left the impression with Israeli troops that ""inside Gaza you are allowed to do anything you want."" ""At first the specified action was to go into a house,"" one squad leader is quoted as saying. ""We were supposed to go in with an armored personnel carrier called an Achzarit [which translates to ""Cruel""] to burst through the lower door, to start shooting inside and then ... ""I call this murder ... in effect, we were supposed to go up floor by floor, and any person we identified we were supposed to shoot. I initially asked myself: 'Where is the logic in this?' ""From above they said it was permissible, because anyone who remained in the sector and inside Gaza City was in effect condemned, a terrorist, because they hadn't fled. I didn't really understand: On the one hand they don't really have anywhere to flee to, but on the other hand they're telling us they hadn't fled so it's their fault ... This also scared me a bit."" The Israeli military's advocate general ordered an immediate investigation into the soldiers' accounts, the Israeli military spokesman's office said Thursday. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak told Army Radio Thursday that ""Israel has the most moral army in the world"" and that the accounts will be checked carefully. But graduates of the Yitzhak Rabin pre-military preparatory program at Oranim Academic College in Kiryat Tivon, the newspaper reported, gave accounts that ran counter to military claims that ""Israeli troops observed a high level of moral behavior during the operation."" The accounts were written down by the head of the college's pre-military program, Danny Zamir. He told Haaretz that he did not know what the soldiers were going to say and that what they heard ""shocked us."" According to Haaretz, Zamir passed on the soldiers' comments to Ashkenazi, saying he ""feared a serious moral failure in the IDF."" Contacted by CNN, Zamir said he would not comment to the foreign media on the matter. He told an Israeli television network that ""what was most disturbing in this matter was the perception that they gave in certain units that the normative atmosphere was 'all is permissible' when you are dealing with Palestinian homes, property, and in the most extreme cases also their lives."" In one account, a squad leader from a brigade serving in Gaza described an incident in which an elderly Palestinian woman was shot and killed at the orders of a company commander. None of the Israeli soldiers quoted in the Haaretz articles admitted to taking part first-hand in the killing of Palestinian civilians, and it is unclear whether all of them witnessed the events they described. ""We take these allegations very seriously ... and if there was wrongdoing there will be consequences,"" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said. ""But this is second-, third-hand information, hearsay information. We have to get to the bottom, we have to get to the truth."" Separately, a coalition of nine Israeli human rights groups called on Israeli Attorney General Menachem Mazuz to reconsider his refusal to establish an independent investigative body to examine the military's actions during the Gaza campaign. The groups -- The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Bimkom, B'tselem, Gisha, Hamoked, The Public Committee Against Torture, Yesh Din, Physicians for Human Rights, Rabbis for Human Rights, Adalah and Itach - Women Lawyers for Social Justice -- said accounts by Palestinians raise the possibility that acts by the military were worse than previously suspected.

"The wife of powerful Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman has given birth to twins in a Los Angeles hospital and returned to Mexico, according to a senior U.S. government official. The source asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Guzman is wanted by U.S. authorities for leading an operation that has allegedly trafficked hundreds of tons of cocaine into the U.S. over a 20-year period. For his efforts, his cartel has received several billion dollars, according to U.S. anti-drug officials. The Justice Department has issued a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. Guzman, who is believed to be 54, married 22-year-old beauty queen Emma Coronel in 2007, officials say. Coronel carries both U.S. and Mexican citizenship and apparently violated no U.S. laws in traveling to California to give birth, the U.S. official said. The source says officials were aware of Coronel's travels and the August 15 births but kept it secret until a Los Angeles Times story this week reported the news. Copies of the twin girls' birth certificates leave blank the space for ""name of father,"" but the mother's name is listed as Emma Modesta Coronel, who was born in California on July 2, 1989, according to records with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The twin girls were born August 15 in Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, California, according to the records.","Birth certificates for twin girls leave blank the name of father .

"""Culture is not the main reason why most Chinese people leave. This is a romantic view. Most people leave China because of practical reasons like education, food and wealth security and air quality."" This is the view of Li Chen, who moved to Hong Kong from the mainland two years ago. A combination of pragmatism and aspiration led the 32-year-old Masters of Journalism student to leave. He said when his wife was offered the chance to relocate to Hong Kong, the timing for the couple was just right. The move allowed Li to pursue his passion for photography and will earn him his Masters degree from University of Hong Kong. Millions of Chinese share Li's relocation bug. In 2013, 8.5 million mainly middle-class Chinese were living abroad, while only 848,000 people had moved to China, according to report by an influential Beijing-based think tank, the Center for China & Globalization (CCG). The Communist-backed People's Daily last year called it, ""the world's worst brain drain."" Waves of Chinese deserting the mainland is nothing new, but this time they're taking their money and talent with them -- making the new phenomenon a wealth, as well as brain drain. But what's fueling the exodus and does the Chinese government care enough to reverse the trend? Wealth preservation . Many wealthy Chinese -- business people, investors and even Communist Party officials -- are cutting loose to protect their assets. President Xi Jinping's vigorous anti-corruption drive is a siren call for the new China, in which cash and connections are no longer a barrier to immunity and prosecution. Guilty or not, some are wondering if they could be the campaign's next targets -- and rather than linger to find out, they're transporting themselves, their families and their gains out of China. Among this group are the so-called ""naked officials,"" civil servants whose family members live abroad. President Xi recently banned their promotion to prevent them from absconding with public funds. Others choose to quit China because they don't feel its financial system is sufficiently regulated enough to protect their fortunes. Every year, more want to make the break. Of the rich Chinese surveyed in the 2014 China-based Hurun Report, 64% said they were emigrating, or planning to do so this year -- 4% more than last year. Their ticket out of China is chiefly via foreign investor visas offered by developed countries like the United States, Britain and Australia. But the programs are not without controversy. The Canadian immigration department recently ditched its flagship scheme, which offered permanent residency in return for a $719,000 interest-free loan to the government, thanks to a massive backlog of applications and domestic opposition. Jean-Christian Brillant, consul and spokesperson from the Canadian Consulate General in Hong Kong and Macau, told CNN that the demographic wasn't a good fit for Canada. ""Research shows that immigrant investors pay less in taxes than other economic immigrants and are less likely to stay in Canada over the medium- to long-term. ""They often lack the skills, including official language proficiency, to integrate as well as other immigrants from the same countries."" Li, a businesswoman from Beijing, submitted her application for the investor visa scheme two years ago in the hope it would help her firm and support her child's education. ""The news was a blow,"" she told the state-run Xinhua news agency. ""This does not change my decision. Canada remains my top choice. The United States and Australia are also good options."" Education and jobs . Other than wealth preservation, ""people also go (abroad) for opportunities, quality of life, and where their skills are better valued,"" said David Zweig, a professor and specialist in China's human resources at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. As the Chinese saying goes, ""painting on a little gold,"" or obtaining a foreign education, is a highly prized maneuver. Given the chance, many postgraduate Chinese students -- and in particular Ph.D students -- choose to stay put overseas, at least in the mid-term. Li, a journalism masters student, said ""I like the culture in Hong Kong, it's open and free. It's unlikely this type of atmosphere will take root in China anytime soon."" The system of guanxi, or connections required to procure a decent job, also puts people off returning. Pan Xiao, a part-time student and publishing company employee, said, ""In Hong Kong, I can find a job by myself, not through my father, my mother, or my uncle."" Health is wealth . Meanwhile, unbridled economic growth has brought a string of food and environmental scares in its wake. Smog from pollution has reached levels hazardous to human health and blanketed the capital Beijing and much of northeast China in recent months, prompting Premier Li Keqiang to declare a ""war on pollution."" Those who can afford to exit are considering their options very seriously. ""High net earners cite wealth preservation, education for their children, food and environmental security as the main reasons for considering investment immigration,"" said Jennifer Zeng, a private wealth expert from management consulting firm Bain & Company. Waging a talent war . How damaging for China is this wealth and brain drain? Wang Huiyao, the director of The Center for China & Globalization, said the phenomenon threatens China's long-term economic transformation. He's urging the Chinese government to set up an immigration bureau and encourage more skilled foreigners to immigrate into China. ""The U.S. is selecting talent from 7.9 billion people, but we are from only 1.3 billion,"" he said. Zweig, a specialist in China's human resources said that China's leaders are acutely conscious of the brain deficit, particularly at the upper end of the academic pyramid. ""China is waging a talent war -- it's the most active state in the world in terms of reversing migration,"" he said. Hoping to lure back the brightest heads, the government's ""Thousand Talent Program,"" targets top tier academics, scientists and entrepreneurs. But the program, which was launched in 2009, has had limited success. Zweig says that although entrepreneurs are returning to a newly vibrant culture of venture capital, China has not been successful in getting others back. Yet, the Center for China & Globalization contends the takeoff overseas has its upside. Migration establishes a pool of Chinese expertise and connections abroad. From there the Chinese can understand and learn from more developed nations and put this knowledge and expertise to good use when they return. For now, Li, a student, said he cannot be cast as a ""sea-turtle,"" the Chinese term for returnees. ""The hardest thing was to leave friends and family, but I have no plans to return to the mainland.""","China sees 8.5 million mainly middle-class living abroad with less than 10% moving in .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was given a prestigious journalism award in Argentina on Tuesday, despite his frequent and outspoken criticism of media outlets at home and abroad. Chavez received the Rodolfo Walsh journalism award from Argentina's Universidad Nacional de La Plata ""for his unquestionable and authentic commitment to support the freedom of peoples."" During a raucous, two-hour acceptance speech in front of hundreds of students and the university's journalism faculty, Chavez accused large media outlets of ""manipulation"" and said that in Venezuela today, there is ""more freedom of expression and the press than any time in our history."" The Rodolfo Walsh award, given to people who advance the cause of press freedom, is named in honor of the late Argentine journalist who was killed in 1977 during Argentina's ""Dirty War,"" when military leaders systematically eliminated dissident voices. Walsh was also a co-founder of Prensa Latina, Cuba's state-run news agency. Past award winners include Argentine journalists Joaquin Morales Sola and Tomas Eloy Martinez as well as Bolivian president Evo Morales, a close ally of Chavez. Flush with petrodollars, Chavez's government in 2005 helped create Telesur, a state-funded television network that covers news from throughout Latin America and the globe. Telesur has been championed as an alternative voice to privately owned media conglomerates, but also criticized for its one-sided coverage of Chavez. Ironically, at Tuesday's award ceremony, private television networks were prohibited from broadcasting the event with their own cameras and instead had to air the signal provided by Telesur. Journalists and politicians in Argentina criticized the choice of Chavez as the award recipient, claiming that he has continually worked to silence his critics and suppress freedom of the press throughout Venezuela. ""Chavez has closed more than 30 radio stations and six television channels and constantly threatens to take away broadcast licenses of any media that is at all critical of his administration,"" said Jorge Macri, a congressman from Buenos Aires province. ""That's why I consider it a lack of respect for the people who have received this award previously that it is now being awarded to the Venezuelan president."" The award ceremony in Argentina came two days after protesters prevented trucks carrying Argentina's two largest daily newspapers, Clarin and La Nacion, from leaving the printing press. The action further inflamed an ongoing feud between Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and the Argentine media, which she has accused of unfairly criticizing her administration. Opposition leaders claim that the government authorized the blockade. On Monday, Clarin published a blank white page on its cover to protest the action. ""The Argentine government needs to take immediate measures to sanction this disregard and violation of a judicial ruling that constitutes an attack on freedom of the press,"" said Claudio Paolillo of the Inter American Press Society. Earlier Tuesday, Kirchner met with Chavez at the Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires, where they signed a series of economic accords. Kirchner skipped Chavez's award ceremony at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata -- which she and her late husband, former Argentine President Nestor Kirchner, attended in the 1970s -- to meet with U2 frontman Bono, who is in Argentina for three concerts this week. According to a government spokesman, Bono asked Argentina's support in developing medical vaccines to eliminate diseases like malaria and for Kirchner's help in encouraging fellow G-20 leaders to demand that oil and mining companies publicly reveal their financial status.","Venezuelan president receives prestigious award honoring press freedom .

"An unknown hacker apparently gained access to a 2-year-old girl's baby monitor, calling her by name and harassing her, and her parents, with insults and profanity. A couple in suburban Houston, Texas, told CNN affiliate KTRK that, over the weekend, they heard a strange voice in the bedroom shared by their two toddlers. When they got there, Marc Gilbert said they realized the voice was coming from the Web camera they use to keep tabs on the children. What they heard next was ugly. ""He said, 'Wake up Allyson, you little slut,' "" Gilbert said. He said the hacker, who had a British or European accent, may have read her name on a wall in the bedroom. When he and his wife Lauren arrived, Gilbert said, the camera swiveled to face them. The hacker proceeded to call him a ""stupid moron"" and his wife a bitch, Gilbert said, before he unplugged the camera. The only positive about the situation, he said, is that Allyson never woke up. She was born deaf and has cochlear implants to help her hear, which she was not wearing while sleeping. ""I felt like somebody broke into your house,"" Gilbert said. ""As a father, I'm supposed to protect her against people like this. So it's a little embarrassing to say the least, but it's not going to happen again."" Baby monitors, particularly those with video capabilities, have been shown in the past to be vulnerable. Video monitors can broadcast to TVs and hand-held receivers, or over Wi-Fi to computers, smartphones and tablets. In 2009, an Illinois family sued the manufacturer of its monitor after they discovered that they and their neighbors could monitor each other's feeds. Some newer models have technology that jumps from frequency to frequency, making them more secure, while older monitors do not. Security experts warn parents to make sure to enable passwords for baby monitors and Web cameras. Most new models are equipped with that ability, they say. Experts like  Lisa Vaas of the Sophos Security blog also say to make sure home Wi-Fi and routers are password-protected. ""Those who can't figure this out should ask for help from somebody with security expertise -- somebody they trust with the safety of extremely precious things,"" Vaas said. In comments on the KTRK article about the hack, Marc Gilbert said he did take basic security precautions: ""The router was password protected and the firewall was enabled. The IP camera was also password protected,"" he said. ""Of course, devices may well be protected by passwords, but default passwords that haven't been changed are like having no password at all, as other commenters pointed out,"" wrote Vaas on the Sophos Security blog. Multiple security experts have identified the camera model shown in the Houston news report as a Foscam FI9821P.  A FAQ page on the manufacturer's site lists the default user name and password -- both ""admin"" -- for the camera, as well as the default port used to connect it to the Web. Altering those default settings ""with a non-trivial password would make the device far more difficult to access, and probably too much trouble to bother with,"" wrote technology and security analyst Larry Seltzer for tech blog ZDNet. ""If you want to go even further and make it really hard for attackers, you can change the default port."" Seltzer said that anyone on the Internet could build a scanner that would find cameras still hooked up to their default port. They could then check those cameras to see if they still open using the default password. ""This is almost certainly what happened,"" he wrote. Earlier this year, researchers at security firm Qualys used the Foscam in a demonstration of how Web-enabled cameras can be exploited. Foscam did not immediately respond Wednesday to a message seeking comment for this story.","Hacker curses at 2-year-old through baby monitor in her room .

"(CNN) -- A cold morning mist hangs over row after row of deep purple grapes -- a scene ripe for thoughtful contemplation. Just a few fields away a civil war ensues, and occasionally the sound of sirens punctuates the serene vineyard. In the Golan Heights, two drastically different worlds exist side-by-side -- as dissimilar as water and wine. While the multimillion dollar Pelter Winery in northern Israel begins each morning harvesting fruit, nearby Syrian rebels and government troops exchange gunfire. Israel occupied this strategic plateau from Syria in the 1967 war. And the region -- characterized by a dry climate, high altitude, and sunshine ideal for grape growing -- was turned into a major wine producer. Fruits of labor . Today the Pelter Winery is one such site, producing over 100,000 bottles each year. Jews and Arabs from nearby villages harvest the grapes, before a conveyer belt delivers them to a giant press. There's no foot stomping here, as the richly-colored fruit is processed and placed in giant oak barrels that co-owner Tal Pelter likes to call ""expensive tea bags."" ""In a year from now it'll be ready,"" he explains in a warehouse stacked high with barrels. ""When you go to taste the barrels you know where you started. You see the progress in the development of the flavor."" Messy Business . But the business hasn't been left completely untouched by the bloodshed across the rolling hills. One time an airstrike hit the winery, shrapnel peppering the walls and injuring one person. The tanks holding the wine were also hit, spilling tens of thousands of bottles of wine over the ground.

"Arizona's SB1062 has pulled off a sort of political magic trick, in that warring sides can read the bill's text and have not only different reactions, but completely opposite ones. While proponents of gay rights dub the bill oppressive, those in favor of the bill becoming law say it represents freedom. Freedom vs. oppression: That's the polar contrast Gov. Jan Brewer must consider as she sits down to ""listen to both sides"" this week ahead of her decision whether to sign or veto the bill that has divided her state and drawn national and commercial interests into the fray. Brewer has until Saturday to make her call, and her fellow Republicans in the state Legislature have suggested that a veto is likely. In short, SB1062 would amend the existing Religious Freedom Restoration Act, allowing business owners to deny service to gay and lesbian customers so long as proprietors were acting solely on their religious beliefs. The bill's advocates insist that those claiming SB1062 amounts to bigotry and discrimination have hijacked and misrepresented its aims. What's your take on the issue? ""The attacks on SB1062 show politics at its absolute worse. They represent precisely why so many people are sick of the modern political debate. Instead of having an honest discussion about the true meaning of religious liberty, opponents of the bill have hijacked this discussion through lies, personal attacks, and irresponsible reporting,"" said Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy, which lent a hand in scribing the bill. Kellie Fiedorek, an attorney for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which also helped craft the bill, called SB1062 a ""balancing test"" that would protect all religions and sexual orientations while prohibiting Arizonans from ""coercing someone to violate their sincerely held beliefs."" ""This bill has nothing to do with discrimination. It's protecting basic freedoms that belong to everyone,"" she said, explaining that it would protect a gay photographer's decision not to work for Westboro Baptist Church, or Muslims who don't want to sell ""pork sandwiches on a Saturday."" Brewer has a history . A dreadnought of the conservative cause, Brewer rarely shies from controversy and, often in the face of staunch political and economic backlash, has boldly defended her stances on the economy, gun rights, regulation, taxation, immigration and even wagging her finger in the face of President Barack Obama. ""I don't rely a whole lot on my gut because I have to look at what (the bill) says and what the law says and take that information and do the right thing,"" she said from the National Governors Association's winter meeting in Washington. ""I will do the right thing for the state of Arizona."" But since Thursday, when the state House of Representatives OK'd the bill by a 33-27 margin and sent it to Brewer's desk, what's right for Arizona has become somewhat amorphous. Already, three GOP senators who voted in favor of SB1062, including a co-sponsor, Sen. Bob Worsley, have changed their minds. The bill passed the state Senate 17-13 with the ""yea"" votes of the three senators. ""While our sincere intent in voting for the bill was to create a shield for all citizens' religious liberties, the bill has instead been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword for religious intolerance. These allegations are causing our state immeasurable harm,"" Worsley and Sens. Adam Driggs and Steve Pierce said in a letter sent to Brewer on Monday. ""As Arizona leaders we feel it is important to loudly proclaim that we strongly condemn discrimination in any form,"" the letter said. Backlash bubbles up . The National Football League, which has scheduled Super Bowl XLIX for the Phoenix suburb of Glendale next year, has a like stance, and league spokesman Brian McCarthy issued a Monday statement to that effect, saying, ""We are following the issue in Arizona and will continue to do so should the bill be signed into law, but will decline further comment at this time."" The state's own Super Bowl Host Committee was more blunt in its statement, which said it strives to promote ""economic vitality"" and ""adoption of this legislation would not only run contrary to that goal but deal a significant blow to the state's economic growth potential. We do not support this legislation."" A few Fortune 500 companies concur, as Marriott warned Brewer in a letter that the legislation ""would have profound negative impacts on the hospitality industry,"" and American Airlines CEO Doug Parker told the governor that signing the bill ""would jeopardize all that has been accomplished so far."" Apple, which is building a glass plant in Mesa that's slated to create hundreds of jobs, said Monday that it, too, was urging Brewer to veto SB1062. The state Chamber of Commerce and Greater Phoenix Economic Council have come out against the bill as well, and local businesses in Tucson and Phoenix have also taken strong stances. Scott Koehler of Phoenix FASTSIGNS has printed off dozens of signs saying ""Open for business to everyone,"" which he's giving away to businesses. In Tucson, Rocco's Little Chicago Pizzeria took to its Facebook page to post a photo of a sign reading, ""We reserve the right to refuse service to Arizona legislators."" But while opposition to the bill has been loud -- and has included the condemnations of John McCain and Jeff Flake, the state's Republican U.S. senators -- there are those who say the bill is vital in a nation that has increasingly turned hostile toward religion. Whom does it protect? Said the Center for Arizona Policy's Herrod, ""Simply put, the fear-mongering from opponents is unrelated to the language of the bill, and proves that hostility towards people of faith is very real. It's a shame we even need a bill like this in America. But growing hostility against freedom in our nation, and the increasing use of government to threaten and punish its own citizens, has made it necessary."" State Sen. Al Melvin, a hopeful to succeed Brewer, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that Arizona was a ""people friendly"" state and that SB1062 was merely a ""pre-emptive"" measure that would prevent attacks on religion in the future. ""All of the pillars of society are under attack in the United States: the family, the traditional family, traditional marriage, mainline churches, the Boy Scouts, you name it,"" he said. Asked if he could cite specific examples of attacks on Arizonans' freedom of religion, Melvin replied, ""Not now, no, but what about tomorrow?"" Pressed further about whether the bill could be used to deny service to divorcees or unwed mothers on religious grounds, he scoffed. ""I think you're being farfetched,"" he told Cooper. ""Who would discriminate against them? I've never heard of discrimination against people like that. ... I don't know of anybody in Arizona that would discriminate against a fellow human being."" Arizona constitutionally outlawed same-sex marriages in 2008, and legal experts say nothing in present Arizona law would prevent a business owner from discriminating against gays and lesbians, making SB1062 unnecessary. Brewer alluded to these provisions in an interview after SB1062 was passed last week. ""I think anybody that owns a business can choose who they work with or who they don't work with,"" she said. While Arizonans on both sides of the issue, as well as the nation at large, keep keen eyes on Phoenix as Brewer ponders her decision, the governor has hinted that the issue, for her, may come down to whether the ban or protection of freedom -- depending on how you view it -- needs to be enshrined in state law. ""I don't know that it needs to be statutory. In my life and in my businesses, if I don't want to do business or if I don't want to deal with a particular company or person or whatever, I'm not interested. That's America. That's freedom.""","Gov. Jan Brewer to decide by Saturday whether to sign SB1062 into law .

"Sandra Avila Beltran, known as the ""Queen of the Pacific"" for alleged drug dealings, was deported Tuesday from the United States to Mexico, where she will face money-laundering charges, the third set of criminal accusations against her. Avila landed in Mexico City on a chartered plane from El Paso, Texas, along with other deportees, the Mexican attorney general's office said. She was being held in a hangar belonging to the attorney general's office, where she will be served with an arrest warrant, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. She will undergo a medical exam before being transported to the state of Jalisco, where she faces charges of money laundering, according to Notimex. Avila's name stands out on the list of accused leaders of Mexico's male-dominated drug trade. The 52-year-old's life is the subject of a best-selling book and a popular ballad. She was dubbed Queen of the Pacific because the smuggling routes she is alleged to have controlled brought drugs from Colombia to Mexico along the Pacific Coast. Avila's lawyer, Stephen Ralls, told CNNMexico last week that Avila is ""optimistic"" about facing what will be her third judicial process, after being exonerated in her first trial in Mexico and having reach a plea deal in her second case in the United States. Mexico arrests alleged leader of Gulf Cartel . A federal court in Miami in July sentenced Avila to 70 months in prison for helping a Colombian drug lord, but under the plea deal the judge ruled that her time served in Mexico and in the United States was enough to complete her sentence. The judge ordered her deportation. Avila was first arrested in Mexico City on September 28, 2007, smiling before cameras as authorities trumpeted her detention. Mexico's case against her drew widespread attention as it made its way through the nation's courts. After her acquittal, authorities extradited her last year to the United States, where she was accused of conspiring to smuggle cocaine along with Juan Diego Espinosa Ramirez, a Colombian national who was also known as ""The Tiger."" Avila denied the charges. And despite the high-profile accusations against her, authorities have not convicted Avila of any direct drug-trafficking crimes. The U.S. conviction was for being an accessory after the fact.","Sandra Avila Beltran had pleaded guilty in a drug case in the United States .

"(CNN)  -- As protests continue over the disputed presidential elections in Iran, we asked two analysts to explain the background to the controversy. Supporters of President Ahmadinejad wave flags at a massive rally in Tehran Sunday to celebrate his victory. Q) What degree of election monitoring is there in Iran? A) The problem with this election, according to London-based Mideast analyst Amir Taheri, is that there is no independent monitoring at all in Iran with the interior ministry arguing that the Council of the Guardians of the Constitution, a ""star chamber"" of 12 mullahs, would have that role. ""Candidates are not allowed to be present at polling stations during voting or counting. Many voters are illiterate and officials help them fill in their ballot papers, so the possibilities for rigging are immense. And there are no booths in the polling stations so voting is done in public, not in private -- a major obstacle for transparency,"" Taheri said. So the problem for opposition candidates in this election, said Taheri, the author of ""The Persian Night,"" is that there are no concrete examples of fraud because there was no monitoring. ""You could say all of Iran's 10 presidential elections have been fraudulent or that all were fair -- we just don't know. All have been held in the same way. The whole electoral process from the vetting of candidates to voting and ballot counting is conducted by the state."" Q) So is it possible that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did win the election? A) The president does indeed have great public support in Iran, Taheri said, adding that ""I'm sure he did win the election but it's impossible he won 63 percent of the vote. The results probably exaggerated the scale of his support."" According to official results, Ahmadinejad won in all regions and among all classes and ages -- again, something that Taheri said was unlikely, ""but I can't prove it."" Had he not exaggerated the scale of his victory, Taheri said, unlike in previous presidential elections, it is possible there wouldn't be the outcry there is now. ""Many Iranians feel insulted by the results because they feel their vote didn't count. Everybody knows, for instance that Ahmadinejad is unpopular in cities but he still won the vote there. That is why people are so angry."" Another Iran expert Karim Sadjadpour agreed, saying he believed this was ""a stolen election.""  Watch Sadjadpour explain why election was ""stolen"" » . ""There are a lot of signs there were major improprieties. First of all there were 40 million votes cast and just two hours after the polls had closed they announced Ahmadinejad's victory: and these votes are hand counted in Iran... Sadjadpour, an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, added: ""Another example I give is that (opposition leader Mir Hossein) Moussavi, who is an ethnic Azeri Turk, lost the province of Iranian Azerbaijan. This is the equivalent of Barack Obama losing the African American vote to John McCain in 2008."" Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the record voter turnout in Friday's election showed Iranians value ""resistance against oppressors,"" the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. ""Pointing to enemies' massive propaganda campaign to discourage people from taking part in the elections, Ayatollah Khamenei also said there was really a divine miracle behind this elections, given its results that was 10 million higher than any of the previous ones in the 30-year history of elections in Iran,"" IRNA reported. Q) Will the anger and protests on the streets subside or grow into something much greater? A) Much depends on what the opposition candidates do in coming days, according to Sadjadpour. ""We've never in the 30-year history of the Islamic republic seen the revolutionary elite so divided,"" he said. Former centrist president Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a founding father of the Islamic republic, and Moussavi are now both opposition candidates. ""They feel the election was stolen from them and that the majority of public support is on their side. They're planning more public protests so this tumult may not subside any time soon.""  Gallery: Emotions run high after election » . Q) How will the regime deal with these protests? A) Iran's leaders ""have repression down to a science,"" said Sadjadpour. ""Before the election they ease political and social restrictions because they want to project a democratic face to the world. But at times like these when rallies are getting out of hand they use overwhelming force to nip them in the bud. So I anticipate more use of force to ensure they don't get out of hand.""  Watch report on latest violence in Iran » . Q) What will the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei do? A) This is the big question and there were reports on Monday he would agree to an investigation into allegations of vote rigging. Speaking earlier, Sadjadpour said he felt the supreme leader would not intervene unless he felt his sustainability as leader was at stake. ""The reason why is that I believe he was behind this power grab. Ahmadinejad was his candidate so he's not exactly an objective actor. Opposition candidates are trying to appeal to Khamenei before they take to the streets but I'm not sure how he walks back from this."" Q) What does four more years of Ahmadinejad mean for Iran and the rest of the world? A) The big problem the United States and Europe is to stop Iran from going nuclear and Ahmadinejad's reelection means Iran's aggressive policy towards the West is not going to change. ""I feel the results are quite disastrous,"" said Sadjadpour. ""In terms of the U.S.-Iran relationship, Ahmadinejad's mere presence could well serve as an insurmountable obstacle to confidence building. He presses the worst buttons in the context of domestic U.S. politics with his denial of the Holocaust and belligerence towards Israel. Domestically in Iran he has profoundly mismanaged the economy with one of the highest inflation rates in the world and high unemployment."" However according to TIME magazine, behind closed doors the White House may be relieved by the result. Despite the attention paid to the office of the Iranian presidency, nuclear policy is set by the country's religious leaders and appear determined to amass enriched uranium whether or not a hard-liner or a moderate is president, the magazine said Monday. ""Ahmadinejad's win may increase Washington's chances of getting tougher sanctions on Iran if they refuse to negotiate,"" TIME reported senior Administration officials as saying.","Analysts explain background to allegations of ballot fraud in Iran's elections .

"(CNN) -- The ruptured Macondo well, a mile under the Gulf of Mexico off the Louisiana coast, has been pronounced dead following the worst oil disaster in U.S. history, but that doesn't mean work associated with the spill is complete, the government's point man for the disaster response said Monday. ""It's going to go on as long as it takes to get the marshes and the beaches clean,"" retired Adm. Thad Allen told CNN's ""American Morning. ""We have detailed plans that we've negotiated with the states and the parishes in Louisiana to determine, if you will, how clean is clean."" In some areas, such as Louisiana's Barataria Bay, ""we're going to stay with this for quite a while,"" he said. At some point, officials may decide they have done all they can, ""but for right now, we're still at it."" Although authorities say testing does not show high levels of oil remaining in the water, some researchers insist the oil has settled to the sea floor and infiltrated the bottom, where it could affect ecosystems. Asked about those reports, Allen said, ""I don't think we can know too much about the Gulf of Mexico and the presence of hydrocarbons in the water column."" He said he has been working with Jane Lubchenco, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to develop a long-term subsea oil monitoring program that can be used not only in the response effort, but also as part of long-term restoration. ""What we really need to do is harness all the resources of the federal government and the state and local institutions, including academia, and build a database that can tell us more about the Gulf,"" he sad. ""Right now the readings we're taking don't show large concentrations. We're really talking about microscopic particles of oil. We really need to understand better what's happening on the sea floor."" A joint investigative team is still probing the cause of the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig April 20, which killed 11 men and triggered the underwater oil gusher. Crews last week, as part of the kill process, drilled into the annulus, or the outer ring of the well. No oil was found there, which could be an important clue in the investigation. Allen said it will be up to the joint investigative team, which includes the Department of Interior and others, to determine what occurred. ""There are a lot of theories,"" he said. ""... A lot of people would tell you further down in the well, there was some kind of a crossover between the annulus and the casing pipe where it was cemented. I'm sure we're not going to know that until the investigative team has finished its work."" BP, which owns the well, has left open the possibility of tapping back into the reservoir. Asked whether they should, Allen said that would be a policy decision between BP and the Department of Interior. ""Frankly, it's above my pay grade,"" he said. But he added that any decision would involve ""a high level of assurance"" by the government. Asked his personal opinion, Allen said, ""I think we've got a lot of problems with energy in this country related to fossil fuels and the need to move to other types of fuels."" He called for a ""very balanced discussion"" taking the risks into account, as well as the need to have an energy policy as the transition is made to more environmentally friendly energy sources.","The response will ""go on as long as it takes,"" Thad Allen says .

"London (CNN) -- Julian Assange, the editor of WikiLeaks, walked out of London's High Court after being freed on bail Thursday, nine days after he was arrested for questioning about alleged sex crimes in Sweden. His time in solitary confinement prompted him ""to reflect on the condition of those people around the world also in solitary confinement ... in positions that are more difficult than those faced by me. Those people ... also need your attention and support,"" he said. Assange thanked the public, the media, his lawyers, and the British justice system, saying, ""If justice is not always an outcome, at least it is not dead yet."" Assange, 39, handed himself over to police in London last week. He was sought because Swedish prosecutors want to question him about sex charges unrelated to WikiLeaks. A judge granted him bail on Tuesday, but lawyers representing Sweden immediately filed an appeal, keeping Assange behind bars until the High Court judge decided on the Swedish appeal. Assange won the appeal Thursday. Assange's mother, Christine, said after the ruling that she could ""not wait"" to see him ""and to hold him close."" ""I had faith that the British justice system would do the right thing ... and that faith has been confirmed,"" she said outside the court. Assange must stay at the mansion of a supporter outside London, report to the police daily, wear an electronic tag to monitor his location, and put up 200,000 pounds (about $310,000) in bail money, plus two 20,000-pound sureties (about $31,000 each), the judge ruled. Judge Duncan Ouseley said he did not regard Assange as a fugitive and there was no concrete evidence to believe he would abscond. Assange ""clearly has some desire to clear his name,"" the judge said, adding that if he failed to appear in court, the ""charges would always be hanging over his head."" Assange has the potential to flee, Ouseley found, but said if he did so, it would ""diminish him in the eyes of his supporters."" Lawyers representing Swedish prosecutors had argued that no bail conditions would be satisfactory, prompting Assange's lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson, to suggest derisively that they saw him as ""some sort of Houdini character."" Granting bail ""does not signify any change in the ongoing investigation,"" Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny said in a statement after the ruling, adding that extradition proceedings are in the hands of the British authorities, not the Swedes. Britain's Crown Prosecution Service, which represented Swedish authorities in the fight over bail, said Thursday that Ny ""fully supported"" their decision to appeal Tuesday against granting Assange bail. Vaughn Smith, who offered his mansion to satisfy court requirements that Assange have a permanent address, said the editor would be able to continue his WikiLeaks work from there. He noted that the court had ordered Sweden to pay the cost of the appeal, ""which to me suggests they shouldn't have appealed."" And he said the judge was very clear that Assange is not a fugitive. ""We're not harboring him, we're just giving him a bed,"" Smith said. Smith will keep Assange ""if not under house arrest, at least under mansion arrest,"" Robertson said at Tuesday's bail hearing. After his arrival at Smith's Ellingham Hall in Suffolk, Assange told reporters that his ""highest task"" was to continue his work with WikiLeaks. ""Obviously, clearing my name is also important, and I will continue to do that, my legal team will continue to do that,"" he said. ""We will press the Swedish government to provide us with evidence of the allegations, something that has been denied to date. I have yet to receive a single page of anything ever from this investigation."" He said his arrest ""confirmed to me personally that we are on the right path and has given me enough anger about the situation to last me 100 years."" ""Obviously there have been serious attempts to take down the content by taking us down as an organization and taking me down as an individual,"" he said. Cheers of ""Julian, Julian, Julian, out, out, out!"" and ""Exposing war crimes is no crime!"" went up from his supporters outside the High Court after the decision was announced Thursday. Prominent left-wing journalist John Pilger, an Assange backer, called the ruling ""very good news but it should have happened a long time ago. This hearing was a waste of taxpayers' money."" And he warned about ""the specter of Assange being extradited to the United States, where he could end up in a maximum security prison."" Stephens told journalists as he entered court Thursday that a number of people have offered to help pay Assange's bail, and that the money is ""in the banking system."" Socialite Jemima Khan and Pilger have previously offered money for his bail. Assange is facing accusations of rape, sexual molestation and illegal use of force stemming from separate incidents in August in Stockholm. He has not been charged, but he could face two years in prison if convicted. His lawyers deny the allegations and have vowed to fight any attempts at extradition. The next hearing in the extradition case is scheduled for January 11. Last week, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said he had authorized ""significant"" actions related to a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks' publication of thousands of confidential diplomatic cables, but has declined to elaborate. Only a small fraction of the 250,000 U.S. State Department documents WikiLeaks says it has have been released, and more are being published daily. U.S. authorities and other Western leaders say the documents' publication threatens lives and national security. WikiLeaks and its supporters say the public has a right to know what goes on behind diplomatic doors. Earlier this year, WikiLeaks posted thousands of documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. CNN's Atika Shubert, Peter Wilkinson, Jonathan Wald, Per Nyberg and Lianne Turner contributed to this report.","NEW: Assange says he has ""enough anger about the situation to last me 100 years""

"(CNN) -- A wildfire that has burned more than 4,300 acres south of Salt Lake City, Utah, is 25 percent contained, officials said Tuesday. About 400 personnel were in Herriman, Utah, to battle the Machine Gun fire, as the blaze has been dubbed, said fire spokesman Marshall Thompson. Equipment on scene included 35 fire engines, a total of five air tankers and four Black Hawk helicopters, he said. But high winds may hinder efforts to fight the flames. The National Weather Service has issued a red-flag warning for winds that could gust up to 45 mph, Thompson said. The fire has destroyed three homes, and it caused significant damage to a fourth, said Nicole Martin, spokeswoman for Herriman city. Officials said on Monday the flames had crept to within 30 feet of some residences. About 450 homes remained evacuated, down from 1,600, said Chief Mike Jensen of the Unified Fire Authority. The Red Cross was assisting families, Martin said. Members of the public were asked not to come to the scene unless there is an urgent need, as people must be escorted in the area, authorities said. Thompson said the blaze has burned 4,346 acres, significantly less than the 10,000 acres the fire's footprint was estimated to be on Monday. Authorities expressed optimism about firefighting efforts Monday, but warned that weather conditions could cause a resurgence of fire activity. The fire was sparked Sunday by ammunition fired by Utah National Guardsmen at nearby Camp Williams. National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. Hank McIntyre acknowledged Tuesday that ""we made some mistakes,"" and said steps are being taken to hold those responsible accountable. About 120 National Guardsmen are helping fight the fire, he said, and the Guard provided the helicopters being used. McIntyre said earlier the on-base firefighters thought they had extinguished the brush fire started during the training exercise, but then winds resuscitated the flames. The blaze marched north through an artillery impact area containing some potentially unexploded ordnance that, if heated, could explode, so it was too risky for the firefighters to chase the flames into that area, he said. CNN's Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.","400 personnel are on scene to fight Machine Gun Fire .

"(CNN) -- The slaughter of more than 130 children at a school by the Pakistani Taliban on Tuesday may prove as pivotal to Pakistan's national security policy as the 9/11 attacks were for the United States. For decades since its founding in 1947, Pakistan has conceived of its neighbor India as its main enemy. Indeed, the two countries have fought three major wars with each other as well as many smaller skirmishes. With Tuesday's attack, it is abundantly clear to all Pakistanis that their main enemy is the internal enemy -- the Pakistani Taliban. This realization has been a long time coming, but it has finally come because the Taliban have killed thousands of Pakistani soldiers, police and civilians over the past decade. And with Tuesday's attack the level of Pakistani outrage against the Taliban is now at unprecedented levels. There is a widespread narrative in the United States that the Pakistani government has not done enough to counter the Taliban. That narrative is out of date. In fact there has been a sea change in how, in particular, the Pakistani military regards the Taliban, whom it once supported. In August 2012, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, then the army chief general, gave a speech in Pakistan that didn't get much attention in the West, but it was a clear statement that the most important player in Pakistan's national security was reformulating Pakistani strategy from its overwhelmingly India-focus to the domestic threat posed by the Pakistani Taliban. Kayani said, ""We realize that the most difficult task for any army is to fight against its own people. ... The fight against extremism and terrorism is our own war and we are right in fighting it."" This policy of taking the fight to the Pakistani Taliban has been continued by the new army chief general, Raheel Sharif, who visited the United States last month, a trip that was notable for the warm reception he received in Washington and also at U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, which manages the war in Afghanistan. This visit was all in stark contrast from three years ago when Pakistani-American relations were at their nadir following the raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in which Osama bin Laden was killed. The principal reason for the warming U.S.-Pakistan relationship has been the large-scale operation that the Pakistani military launched beginning in June into the remote tribal region of North Waziristan along the Afghan-Pakistan border. North Waziristan is the headquarters of the Pakistani Taliban, the notorious Taliban-affiliated Haqqani Network and remnants of al Qaeda. Launching such an operation has long been a key demand of the United States to the Pakistani military and government. According to the Pakistani military, during the past six months, it has killed more than 1,000 militants. Among them was the death this month of Adnan Shukrijumah, a key leader of al Qaeda who grew up in New York and Florida. From multiple sources in the Pakistani military and the U.S. government I have heard that it was the Pakistani military, not the civilian government, that was pushing hard to conduct the North Waziristan operation. Earlier in the year, the civilian government, led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, clung to the hope -- in reality, a delusion -- that some kind of a peace deal could be struck with the Pakistani Taliban. As Tuesday's despicable attack makes clear, the Pakistani Taliban are not a bunch of Henry Kissingers-in-waiting eager to make a deal, but rather are led by fanatical religious zealots willing to send half a dozen suicide attackers to kill scores of children. The history of negotiations with fanatical religious zealots is not an encouraging one. Indeed, anyone with the most passing knowledge of previous ""peace"" deals with the Pakistan Taliban would have understood the futility of trying to make a deal with them. The Pakistani government concluded peace deals with the Taliban in 2004, 2005 and 2008. All of the deals collapsed. Today the Pakistani military understands that the Frankenstein that it helped to create must now be killed. It will have the support of the vast majority of Pakistanis to do so.","Peter Bergen: Killing of more than 130 children at Pakistan school shocks a nation .

"The parents of Peter Kassig spoke to reporters Monday, asking for prayers and privacy. ""Our hearts are battered, but they will mend. The world is broken, but it will be healed in the end. And good will prevail as the one God of many names will prevail,"" Paula Kassig said at a church in Indianapolis. Kassig, 26, grew up in that city, the only son of Paula and Ed Kassig. A video released over the weekend appears to show the aftermath of his beheading, at the hands of ISIS. He was captured in 2013 while on his way to Deir Ezzor, Syria. While in captivity, he converted to Islam and took the name Abdul-Rahman Kassig. ""Please pray for Abdul-Rahman, or Pete if that's how you know him, at sunset this evening,"" Ed Kassig said. ""Pray also for all people in Syria, in Iraq, and around the world that are held against their will. And lastly, please allow our small family the time and privacy to mourn, cry -- and yes, forgive -- and begin to heal,"" he said. Peter Kassig joined the U.S. Army in 2006. He became part of the elite 75th Ranger Battalion and deployed to Iraq in 2007. He served only a brief tour. He was honorably discharged for medical reasons and returned to the United States to study political science at Butler University. He also married and quickly divorced. And he felt stirrings of a higher calling even then. ""I was going to school with kids who look the same, were the same age as me, but we weren't the same,"" he told CNN's Arwa Damon in a 2012 interview. ""I wanted more of a challenge, a sense of purpose."" After receiving training in emergency medical skills, Kassig returned to the Middle East -- this time as an aid worker. He later formed a nonprofit, Special Emergency Response and Assistance, to deliver humanitarian aid to Syrians affected by the fighting there. ""I am not a doctor. I am not a nurse,"" he said in the 2012 interview. ""But I am a guy who can clean up bandages, help clean up patients, swap out bandages, help run IVs, make people's quality of life a little bit better. This is something for me that has meaning, that has purpose."" Before his capture, he was not unaware of the dangers of what he was doing, but said his work was crucially important. ""There's this impression, this belief that there is no hope. That's when it's more important than ever, against all odds, to try to do something."" In a letter to his parents, he wrote: ""If I do die, I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need."" Margaret Brabant, a professor who served as Kassig's academic counselor during his time at Butler, said all those who knew him are in mourning, but that even in death, her former student can serve others. ""I hope that our students will learn from this individual, and that he tried to give back to the world and that he cared very deeply and loved the world he was in,"" she said. On Sunday, President Barack Obama praised the ""selfless acts of an individual who cared deeply about the plight of the Syrian people."" ""Today we grieve together, yet we also recall that the indomitable spirit of goodness and perseverance that burned so brightly in Abdul-Rahman Kassig, and which binds humanity together, ultimately is the light that will prevail over the darkness of ISIL,"" Obama said.","The father of Peter Kassig asks for prayers and time to heal .

"The wife of an accused al Qaeda operative captured by U.S. forces told CNN that masked men ambushed her husband when he was on the way home from morning prayers. While U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called Abu Anas al Libi ""one of the world's most wanted terrorists,"" al Libi's wife described him a different way in an exclusive interview with CNN on Sunday. Umm Abdul Rahman called al Libi an innocent man, adding that he left al Qaeda in 1996 and had no connection to the twin 1998 bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. ""I am sure of what I am saying -- he did not take part in any bombing anywhere in the world,"" Rahman said. ""He participated in the jihad in Afghanistan. .... He was a member of al-Qaeda and he was  personal security for (Osama) bin Laden -- that's true -- but he did not take part in any operation."" Al Libi was among those indicted for the embassy attacks by a federal grand jury in New York, and U.S. officials and terrorism analysts hailed news of his capture. Meanwhile, Libya's interim government distanced itself from the operation and called the U.S. capture a kidnapping. Rahman told CNN she didn't know who had taken her husband -- only that the raid she watched happen from her Tripoli home happened very quickly. Al Libi was returning to his house at about 6:30 a.m. Saturday (12:30 a.m. ET) when a group of at least 10 men in four vehicles surprised him, his wife told CNN. Some of the men were wearing masks, while others weren't, she said. Those men looked like Libyans to her and they spoke Arabic with Libyan accents, she said. ""What I saw were Libyans. Maybe they had Americans with them, but I didn't see them because there was more than one car. They say there were 10 people involved, but I believe there were more than 10,"" Rahman said. ""I couldn't count them because there were many of them. I can't confirm if they were Americans or not, but what I saw were Libyans. "" Elite team involved in capture . On Sunday, a U.S. official said commandos from the elite U.S. Army Delta Force had snatched the 49-year-old al Qaeda operative. Tripoli has requested an explanation from Washington about the raid, the country's state news agency reported Sunday. The mission was conducted with the knowledge of the Libyan government, said one U.S. official. The Pentagon said the U.S. military was holding al Libi in a ""secure location"" outside Libya. A U.S. official told CNN that he was taken to a U.S. Navy warship after his capture. U.S. forces strike in Libya, Somalia, capture al Qaeda operative . ""It's a masterpiece how someone can craft such an operation,"" said Libyan counterterrorism analyst Noman Benotman, who is also a former jihadist associate of al Libi. Benotman is president of the Quilliam Foundation, a London-based counterterrorism think tank.  He is also a former senior member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which al Libi joined in the mid-1990s before gravitating back toward al Qaeda. Al Libi had been living in that still unsettled nation, more or less in the open, for more than a year despite his alleged associations. According to Benotman, it is unlikely he was still playing an active role for al Qaeda. His wife agreed, saying he was living a normal life, was not in hiding and had reapplied for a job with the oil ministry. She said he has a severe case of hepatitis C and she worries about his health. Next stop, New York? Al Libi has been all around the globe -- Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, Kenya, Britain, Iran and beyond -- making friends with some of the world's most notorious terrorists and enemies with the United States and its allies. On Saturday, his odyssey ended where it began: in his homeland of Libya. His next destination? He eventually will be taken to New York, a source with knowledge of the capture and proceedings told CNN, though the exact timing is unclear. The Obama administration has activated the High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group to interview him for intelligence purposes while he remains in U.S. military custody, U.S. officials told CNN. The team is led by the FBI and includes CIA and other intelligence agencies. After the interviews are concluded, he would be transferred to civilian custody and brought to New York to face federal charges, the officials said. U.S. authorities have long wanted al Libi to stand trial in an American court to face charges for his alleged role in the U.S. embassy bombings that left well over 200 dead and thousands wounded. Edith Bartley lost both her father, Julian Bartley, and her brother, Julian Jr., in the attack in Nairobi, Kenya. Her father was the U.S. Embassy's counsel general; her 20-year-old brother was an intern there. ""We know that this is a firm signal around the globe that as our government is still wading through a standstill right now, that we are still vigilant as a country and focused on international terror, and we're not going to step down at all,"" Bartley told CNN's ""New Day Sunday."" Bartley said while she was relieved when Osama bin Laden -- also indicted in the embassy attacks -- was killed in 2011, she's also happy that al Libi was taken into custody. ""Certainly, we are very pleased to know that we can have someone who is captured, and for the wealth of information that may be available to our intelligence community and our military personnel,"" she said. ""You can't put a price on that."" CNN's Nic Robertson, a veteran of covering al Qaeda, said al Libi's arrest is a ""huge deal."" ""He's a big player in al Qaeda (and) in one of the key target areas, in the north of Africa,"" he said. ""This is a significant step."" Stops in Afghanistan, Britain, Iran and beyond . The FBI's page on al Libi -- part of its roster of ""Most Wanted Terrorists"" and noting the $5 million reward being offered for information leading directly to his apprehension -- says that he is accused in a ""conspiracy to kill United States nationals, to murder, to destroy buildings and property of the United States, and to destroy the national defense utilities of the United States."" Born Nazih Abd al Hamid al Ruqhay, al Libi joined al Qaeda soon after its founding, as the terrorist organization built up its presence in Afghanistan and Pakistan. When the group's late leader Osama bin Laden relocated to Khartoum, Sudan, in 1992, al Libi went with him. As the 1990s continued, al Libi came to be known as one of al Qaeda's most capable operatives, especially for his expertise in surveillance and computers. A fellow al Qaeda operative at one point testified that al Libi was in Nairobi in 1993, allegedly checking out possible targets, including the U.S. Embassy. The blast in Kenya's capital five years later ended up killing more than 200 people and wounding 5,000. The Tanzania blast went off nearly simultaneously, leaving 11 people dead. His wife denied that he had any role in any bombing and said that after he returned to Libya in 2011 during the revolution, he had been asking the Libyan government to help him clear his name. She did admit that he had belonged to al Qaeda, but said he was a personal guard for bin Laden until he left the terror group in 1996. Africa marks 10th anniversary of U.S. embassy bombings . Al Libi at one point joined the jihadist Libyan Islamic Fighters Group before moving to Qatar and then Britain, settling in Manchester. It was there, in 2000, that police raided his home. Authorities uncovered a document that became known as the ""Manchester Manual"" -- hundreds of pages of guidance on carrying out a terrorist campaign. Among them: a document that called for ""attacking, blasting and destroying"" embassies. But what they didn't find was al Libi, who had left the country before the raid. He is thought to have spent time subsequently in Afghanistan before fleeing to Iran after the fall of the Taliban. Western intelligence sources believe he remained in that country before going home to Libya. After years in native Libya, al Libi in U.S. hands . In September 2012, CNN was first to report that al Libi was alive and well in Libya. Western intelligence had tracked his movements in Tripoli, and had even taken surveillance photos. Western intelligence sources said that there was concern that al Libi was working to establish an al Qaeda network in the North African nation, but no evidence has since materialized that he continued to be involved in terrorist operations after he returned to Libya. So how long had he been home? In December 2010, before the outbreak of the unrest that ended with Moammar Gadhafi's death, Libyan authorities told a United Nations committee that al Libi had returned, even giving a Tripoli address for him. And one Western intelligence source said al Libi appears to have been in Libya in the spring of 2011, when the civil war was in full swing. Family members told CNN al-Libi returned to Tripoli in 2011 to take part in the revolution against Gadhafi. His wife, four sons and daughter had arrived from Iran the previous year. Al-Libi's sons and wife say they believed they were under surveillance over the past two years in Libya and expected anything -- even a drone strike. But Saturday's raid still came as a surprise. ""There was no longer any talk about him in the media, so we felt somewhat reassured. He even stopped taking his weapon or his sons with him or hiring private security -- he was living his life normally,"" Rahman said. Counterterrorism analysts told CNN in fall 2012 that al Libi may not have been apprehended at the time because of the delicate security situation in much of Libya, where ex-jihadists -- especially those who once belonged to the Libyan Islamic Fighters Group -- held considerable sway after the campaign against and ultimate ouster of longtime leader Gadhafi. It was not clear for how long, and how much, Libya's government knew about al Libi's presence, or whether other governments had approached them to arrest al Libi. The fact that there's no extradition treaty between Libya and the United States further complicates matters. The fact that al Libi is in U.S. hands, of course, changes everything. In addition to standing trial, al Libi will be questioned about what he knows about al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. And if he talks, he could offer valuable information on men he worked with inside Libya, as well as al Qaeda generally. ""All his recent years of activation is going to come under very, very close and important scrutiny,"" said CNN's Robertson.","Official: Commandos from the elite U.S. Army Delta Force conducted the raid .

"It's either a genius idea for reducing the miseries of long-haul air travel -- or an extreme method of distracting passengers from arguments about leg room. Either way, an Airbus proposal for in-flight virtual reality sensory isolation headgear that controls sights, sounds and even smells experienced by travelers is likely to turn heads -- although if the heads are stuck in helmets, there might not be much room for turning.

""During aircraft flights, certain passengers have periods when they are bored either during a wait phase preceding take off or following landing or during a cruise phase,"" the patent application says. ""More-over it is known that aircraft flights generate stress for certain passengers."" 'Odorous substances' The patent suggests that placing passengers in partial or total ""sensorial isolation"" by piping audio and video directly into their eyes and ears -- and squirting ""odorous substances"" up their nose -- will help make all this go away. ""This isolation allows the passenger to better profit from some of the distractions offered, for example listening to music, watching films,"" says the screed attached to the invention blueprints. ""If the passengers is sensitive to stress, this isolation, possibly associated with one of the above-mentioned activities allows him/her to more easily calm down and relax."" The helmets, designed to be incorporated into the headrest, will also feature remote controls and technology that projects a virtual reality keyboard on the fold down table, enabling passengers to hammer out emails directly on to the detritus of their in-flight meal. It's not known if there are any plans to introduce the helmets in the near future --  Airbus hasn't responded to a CNN query -- but it's likely they're at the same distant stage as another unusual Airbus patent that proposes cycle saddle-style seating. It remains to be seen whether sensory isolation can genuinely improve the in-flight experience, but the innovation must surely be a gift to airline staff. While the eyes of their passengers are helmeted in virtual reality, cabin crew can return to actual reality and relax the mandatory smiles.","Helmets will control what passengers see, hear and smell, according to Airbus patent .

"Beccles, England (CNN) -- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said Friday that the sexual misconduct charges against him are little more than an effort to discredit him and his organization. ""This has been a very successful smear campaign so far, but I think its days are numbered and people are starting to wonder, is what is claimed really true and if it is true, where is the evidence?,"" Assange told NBC's Today show. ""Why has no evidence been provided even to me and my defense attorneys?"" Assange, who was released from a British jail on bail Thursday pending extradition proceedings involving sexual misconduct allegations in Sweden, said the technological and legal attacks on his website are diverting resources from its core mission. But he said it has not slowed the group from publishing new secret diplomatic documents. ""People like to present WikiLeaks as just me and my backpack -- that is not true we are a large organization,"" he told reporters. ""It is resilient, it is designed to withstand decapitation attacks and our publication rate actually increased during the time I was in solitary confinement."" Assange was released Thursday after a British court rejected an appeal on behalf of Swedish authorities to keep him jailed pending an extradition hearing. Assange is wanted for questioning on accusations of rape, sexual molestation and illegal use of force stemming from separate incidents in August in Stockholm. He has not been charged, but he could face two years in prison if convicted. Assange must stay at the mansion of a supporter outside London, report to the police daily, wear an electronic tag to monitor his location, and put up 200,000 pounds (about $310,000) in bail money, plus two 20,000-pound sureties (about $31,000 each), the judge ruled. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for January 11. Assange, 39, and WikiLeaks have been under increasing pressure since the organization began releasing secret U.S. diplomatic cables late last month. Web service providers and payment processors have cut their relations with the organization, its website has been subject to attacks and U.S. authorities have reportedly convened a secret grand jury to investigate possible espionage charges against Assange. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said he has authorized ""significant"" actions related to a criminal investigation into the publication of the diplomatic cables, but has declined to elaborate. Assange said evidence of such an investigation is mounting and responded to a claim that surfaced Friday that he may have supplied software to a U.S. Army private accused of downloading secret documents without authorization. ""I have no information about what you are referring to,"" Assange told Today. ""We don't know what the grounds of that investigation is."" Assange said he is concerned for Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, who faces military accusations of accessing military and diplomatic documents for which he did not have authorization. Manning is being held in solitary confinement, as Assange was while in custody. ""WikiLeaks is designed to not know who its sources are. But we can see he is the only person who has been accused and that means he is in a difficult position where he is, in solitary confinement,"" Assange said. The organization has offered $50,000 for Manning's defense, Assange said. Assange also condemned the Swedish investigation, complaining that ""the whole damn thing is kept secret."" ""All hearings in Sweden were secret. A gag order was attempted to be placed upon my Swedish attorney,"" he told Today. ""And the requested conditions upon my extradition to Sweden and arrival in Sweden was that I would be held incommunicado."" He said something is seriously wrong that such investigations would be handled in such secrecy. Assange -- saying he cooperated with Swedish authorities, got their permission to leave the country and promptly turned himself when when a European arrest warrant was issued -- said he was fighting extradition not because he is guilty but on principle. ""It is not the case that I or any other person should have to fly off to foreign states without the provision of any evidence whatsoever,"" he said. ""That is simply not acceptable to me and it should not be acceptable to any person."" Granting bail ""does not signify any change in the ongoing investigation,"" Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny said in a statement after the ruling, adding that extradition proceedings are in the hands of the British authorities, not the Swedes. Assange said following his release that while clearing his name is important, so is continuing the work of WikiLeaks. About 2,000 of the 250,000 U.S. State Department documents WikiLeaks says it has have been released, Assange said Friday, and more are being published daily. Leaders of the United States and some other countries have said that releasing the documents threatens lives, national security and international relations. WikiLeaks and its supporters say the public has a right to know what goes on behind diplomatic doors. Earlier this year, WikiLeaks posted thousands of documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Assange, was initially granted release on bail on Tuesday, but British prosecutors acting on behalf of Sweden appealed the decision, delaying his release. Cheers of ""Julian, Julian, Julian, out, out, out!"" and ""Exposing war crimes is no crime!"" went up from his supporters outside the High Court after the decision was announced Thursday. Assange said after his release Thursday that his arrest ""confirmed to me personally that we are on the right path and has given me enough anger about the situation to last me 100 years."" CNN's Atika Shubert, Peter Wilkinson, Jonathan Wald, Per Nyberg and Lianne Turner contributed to this report.","WikiLeaks founder says Swedish sex allegations are a smear campaign .

"(CNN) -- If it was just a political pander, it was a beauty. But if it was a serious statement of philosophy, it was chilling -- even scary. Joni Ernst, the Iowa candidate who has vaulted to within an inch of United States Senate due to her boasting of hog castration in this year's most inventive political ad, was speaking to the National Rifle Association in 2012. ""I do believe in the right to carry, and I believe in the right to defend myself and my family -- whether it's from an intruder, or whether it's from a government, should they decide that my rights are no longer important."" Huh? This notion -- that the Second Amendment gives citizens the right to fire upon federal officials, or their local police, or sheriffs or even U.S. military personnel -- is common among right wingers. But it's one thing to hear, say, goofball Ted Nugent honk off that way. (The Nuge, by the way, has boasted about how he avoided taking up arms in defense of his country during Vietnam.) It is another to know that someone with those loopy views is one step away from the United States Senate. The Washington Monthly blogger Ed Kilgore has asked the right question -- the one any Iowa voter should be putting to Ms. Ernst: ""Since you brought it up, exactly what circumstances would justify you shooting a police officer or a soldier in the head?"" Good question, Ed. Is it OK to do so if, say, the Supreme Court stops the counting of votes so as to give the presidency to the candidate who got fewer votes? I don't think so. How about segregation? If ever American citizens were oppressed by their government it was African-Americans under Jim Crow. Thank God we had Dr. King and not Ms. Ernst leading the civil rights movement. Perhaps Ms. Ernst reserves her bloody right to truly egregious government actions, like ensuring affordable health care, even to folks with pre-existing conditions? Lord, I hope not. As Michael Waldman notes in his excellent new book, ""The Second Amendment, A Biography,"" the Second Amendment was designed to ensure that citizen-soldiers would be the heart of our national defense. A standing army, such as we have now, would have been anathema to our Founders. Indeed, Thomas Jefferson, in his first Annual Message to Congress (now known as the State of the Union Address), said, ""nor is it conceived needful or safe that a standing army should be kept up in time of peace."" Should America be invaded, Jefferson said, the proper response was ""the body of neighboring citizens as formed into a militia."" The Founders thought citizen-soldiers would be the military, acting on behalf of the government. They did not advocate armed citizens taking on federal officials. Don't believe me? Ask George Washington. Gen. Washington, as president, forcefully rejected the notion that American citizens had a revolutionary right to take up arms against their government -- even against the most hated government officials enforcing the most hated government program. President Washington and his Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton, sought to enforce a tax on whiskey, which Congress passed in 1791. A group of Pennsylvania whiskey distillers objected, violently. In what was known as the Whiskey Rebellion, they refused to pay the tax and burned the home of the federal tax collector. Washington personally led 13,000 troops to crush the rebellion (the only time a president has commanded troops in the field). Washington was willing to shed blood to ensure no one took up arms against his or her own country. To argue that the Second Amendment allows citizens to turn their guns on their government is to repudiate the actions of George Washington, as well as the Constitution itself. I say this as a gun owner -- and I'm not just talking about some puny 9 mm like the one Ms. Ernst brags about. At last count I have 22 guns. I use them to hunt, shoot targets, and bond with my family. My grandfather was a hunter and gun owner, as is my father, as am I -- as are my sons. But neither we, nor Ms. Ernst nor any American has the right to turn those weapons on American military personnel, peace officers or other government officials. To suggest otherwise betrays our Founders, our Constitution, and common sense.","Paul Begala: Iowa candidate Joni Ernst told NRA she has right to use her gun against government .
He says: This is scary. Here's a question for Ernst: Under what circumstances is it OK do this?
Founders: Citizen-soldiers might act on behalf of government, not shoot at it, he says .
Begala owns 22 guns. Citizens don't have right to turn weapons on police, military, government ."
"He talked a good game of acting on his own if necessary, calling for 2014 to be a ""year of action, but President Barack Obama's State of the Union address showed he knows that true progress depends on cooperation with a divided and recalcitrant Congress. ""Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged,"" he said near the end of the more than hour-long speech, seeming to describe his bad 2013 that lowered his approval ratings. ""But for more than 200 years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress."" It was vintage Obama, blending hopeful calls for a unified approach with declarations of presidential independence through executive orders. There were the now familiar calls to recalibrate the tax code, spend more to rebuild roads and bridges, bolster education and avoid war if at all possible. He brought many to tears with a tribute to Sgt. First Class Cory Remsburg, a disabled war veteran who sat next to first lady Michelle Obama and waved with wounded limbs to a prolonged standing ovation. Even Republicans relentlessly critical of the President conceded his oratorical skill. ""A speech by Barack Obama is a lot like sex,"" said GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. ""The worst there ever was is still excellent."" According to a snap CNN/ORC International poll, 44% of respondents had a ""very positive"" response to Obama's speech, while 32% described a ""somewhat positive"" response and 22% didn't like it at all. Last year, 53% of respondents in a similar poll rated their response to the 2013 address as very positive. The underlying theme of Obama's fifth State of the Union address was his call on Tuesday for the government to work on behalf of all Americans in 2014, and his pledge to do so even if Congress refused to join him in an election year. ""Let's make this a year of action,"" Obama said. ""That's what most Americans want -- for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations."" It's an optimistic goal for a President with a 43% approval rating entering his sixth year in office and facing a determined opposition in the Republican-led House of Representatives with congressional elections looming in November. Search the transcript of Obama's speech . ""What I offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class,"" Obama said. ""Some require congressional action, and I'm eager to work with all of you. But America does not stand still, and neither will I."" On issue after issue, he invited Congress to work with him but said he also would go it alone. Obama called for more government support to rebuild the nation's infrastructure, but also said that ""I will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible."" The President also promised an executive order to raise the minimum wage for some government contract workers. While the action is relatively narrow and affects less than half a million people, Obama urged Congress to follow suit for all low-wage workers in America. Earlier Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner chafed at such unilateral action, telling reporters that Republicans are ""just not going to sit here and let the President trample all over us."" In the official Republican response, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington complained that Obama's policies ""are making people's lives harder."" ""We hope the President will join us in a year of real action -- by empowering people -- not by making their lives harder with unprecedented spending, higher taxes, and fewer jobs,"" she said. One area of possible progress is immigration reform. Obama got a long ovation when he urged Republicans in the House to join Democrats in passing a Senate plan that got bipartisan support. McMorris Rodgers also brought up the issue backed by some Republicans as a way to bolster their weak support among Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority demographic. ""We're working on a step-by-step solution to immigration reform by first securing our borders and making sure America will always attract the best, brightest, and hardest working from around the world,"" she said in describing the more limited GOP approach to the comprehensive Senate measure that includes a path to legal status for immigrants living illegally in the country. On another major reform issue, Obama chided Republicans for trying to undermine his signature health care law that passed in 2010 without GOP support. He cited the millions of people helped by the reforms that ended denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions among its benefits. ""The American people aren't interested in refighting old battles,"" Obama said. ""Let's not have another 40-something votes to repeal a law that's already helping millions of Americans. ...The first 40 were plenty. ... We all owe it to the American people to say what we're for, not just what we're against."" In her response, though, McMorris Rodgers continued the GOP attack line on the health care reforms as big government run amok and causing harm to people by raising costs and limiting their personal choices of doctors and medical treatment. This year's State of the Union is a defining test for Obama . The CNN/ORC poll indicated 59% of respondents thought Obama's policies as presented in the speech would help the economy, a lower figure than in recent years. Obama said he will order the U.S. Treasury to create a new federal retirement savings account called MyRA, a savings bond that would guarantee ""a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in."" It will be available to those whose jobs don't offer traditional retirement savings programs, he said. Additionally, Obama called for: . -- Eliminating $4 billion in tax subsidies for the fossil fuel industries ""that don't need it"" and instead ""invest more in fuels of the future."" -- Equal pay for women, noting they make 77 cents for each dollar a man earns, which he called ""wrong"" and ""an embarrassment"" to prompt loud and long applause. -- Setting new fuel standards for American trucks to help reduce U.S. oil imports ""and what we pay at the pump."" -- Reworking the corporate tax code. He urged Congress to work with him to close ""wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here"" and instead ""lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home."" -- Congress to lift restrictions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay so the prison cna be closed in 2014. Obama also reiterated that he will veto any new sanctions bill from Congress that would derail talks on preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, adding that ""for the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed."" Brazile: Obama's message: A dysfunctional Congress, but we'll get it done anyway . Even as he cited a growing economy and increasing corporate profits, Obama said average wages have been flat. Along with his order raising the minimum wage for workers on federal contracts, Obama asked Congress to get on board with a Democratic proposal to raise the federal minimum to $10.10 per hour. Republicans largely oppose any federal increase, saying it will place a burden on employers. ""This is definitely the President's agenda and has been for some time now,"" said CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, who added it was hard to see how Republicans would respond any differently than before and therefore, it was hard to see big things happening in 2014. John Edwards says Dems should do more on poverty .","Republicans say President Obama is offering the same policies that haven't worked .

"A decade ago, the United States had a virtual monopoly on drones. Not anymore. According to data compiled by the New America Foundation, more than 70 countries now own some type of drone, though just a small number of those nations possess armed drone aircraft. The explosion in drone technology promises to change the way nations conduct war and threatens to begin a new arms race as governments scramble to counterbalance their adversaries. Late last month, China announced that it would use surveillance drones to monitor a group of uninhabited islands in the South China Sea that are controlled by Japan but claimed by China and Taiwan. In August 2010, Iran unveiled what it claimed was its first armed drone. And on Tuesday, the country's military chief, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, disclosed details of a new long-range drone that he said can fly 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), which puts Tel Aviv easily in range. Israel looks to Lebanon after drone shot down . But without an international framework governing the use of drone attacks, the United States is setting a dangerous precedent for other nations with its aggressive and secretive drone programs in Pakistan and Yemen, which are aimed at suspected members of al Qaeda and their allies. Just as the U.S. government justifies its drone strikes with the argument that it is at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates, one could imagine that India in the not too distant future might launch such attacks against suspected terrorists in Kashmir, or China might strike Uighur separatists in western China, or Iran might attack Baluchi nationalists along its border with Pakistan. This moment may almost be here. China took the United States by surprise in November 2010 at the Zhuhai Air Show, where it unveiled 25 drone models, some of which were outfitted with the capability to fire missiles. It remains unclear just how many of China's drones are operational and how many of them are still in development, but China is intent on catching up with the United States' rapidly expanding drone arsenal. When President George W. Bush declared a ""War on Terror"" 11 years ago, the Pentagon had fewer than 50 drones. Now, it has around 7,500. Study: Drone strikes kill, maim and traumatize too many civilians . As Bush embarked on that war, the United States had never used armed drones in combat. The first U.S. armed drone attack, which appears to be the first such strike ever, took place in mid-November 2001 and killed the military commander of al Qaeda, Mohammed Atef, in Afghanistan. Since then, the CIA has used drones equipped with bombs and missiles hundreds of times to target suspected militants in Pakistan and Yemen. CNN Radio: Drone debate -- who can you trust? Only the United States, United Kingdom and Israel are known to have launched drone strikes against their adversaries, although other members of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, such as Australia, have ""borrowed"" drones from Israel for use in the war there. Drone technology is proliferating rapidly. A 2011 study estimated that there were around 680 active drone development programs run by governments, companies and research institutes around the world, compared with just 195 in 2005. In 2010, U.S.-based General Atomics received export licenses to sell unarmed versions of the Predator drone to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. And in March, the U.S. government agreed to arm Italy's six Reaper drones but rejected a request from Turkey to purchase armed Predator drones. An official in Turkey's Defense Ministry said in July that Turkey planned to arm its own domestically produced drone, the Anka. Israel is the world's largest exporter of drones and drone technology, and the state-owned Israeli Aerospace Industries has sold to countries as varied as Nigeria, Russia and Mexico. Building drones, particularly armed drones, takes sophisticated technology and specific weaponry, but governments are increasingly willing to invest the necessary time and money to either buy or develop them, as armed drones are increasingly seen as an integral part of modern warfare. Sweden, Greece, Switzerland, Spain, Italy and France are working on a joint project through state-owned aeronautical companies and are in the final stages of developing an advanced armed drone prototype called the Dassault nEURon, from which the France plans to derive armed drones for its air force. And Pakistani authorities have long tried to persuade the United States to give them armed Predator drones, while India owns an armed Israeli drone designed to detect and destroy enemy radar, though it does not yet have drones capable of striking other targets. The Teal Group, a defense consulting firm in Virginia, estimated in June that the global market for the research, development and procurement of armed drones will just about double in the next decade, from $6.6 billion to $11.4 billion. News: Drones expected to hunt for suspects in Libya attack . States are not alone in their quest for drones. Insurgent groups, too, are moving to acquire this technology. Last year, Libyan opposition forces trying to overthrow the dictator Moammar Gadhafi bought a sophisticated surveillance drone from a Canadian company for which they paid in the low six figures. You can even buy your own tiny drone on Amazon for $250. (And for an extra $3.99, you can get next-day shipping.) As drone technology becomes more widely accessible, it is only a matter of time before well-financed drug cartels acquire them. And you can imagine a day in the not too distant future where armed drones are used to settle personal vendettas. Given the relatively low costs of drones -- already far cheaper than the costs of a fighter jet and of training a fighter jet pilot -- armed drones will play a key role in future conflicts. Opinion: When are drone killings illegal? While the drone industry thrives and more companies, research institutes and nations jump on board the drone bandwagon, the United States is setting a powerful international norm about the use of armed drones, which it uses for pre-emptive attacks against presumed terrorists in Pakistan and Yemen. It is these kinds of drone strikes that are controversial; the use of drones in a conventional war is not much different than a manned aircraft that drops bombs or fires missiles. According to figures compiled by the New America Foundation, drone attacks aimed at suspected militants are estimated to have killed between 1,900 and 3,200 people in Pakistan over the past eight years. While there has been considerable discussion of the legality of such strikes in a number of U.S. law schools, there has been almost no substantive public discussion about drone attacks among policymakers at the international level. The time has come for some kind of international convention on the legal framework surrounding the uses of such weapons, which promise to shape the warfare of the future as much as tanks and bombers did during the 20th century.

"Dr. Rick Sacra, who entered The Nebraska Medical Center three weeks ago with Ebola, was released Thursday. ""The CDC has declared me safe and free of the virus,"" Sacra said at a news conference. ""Thank God, I love you all!"" Sacra joked about now being a lifetime Huskers fan as he thanked his medical team, the biocontainment unit team and his friend, Dr. Kent Brantly. Sacra and Brantly were infected with Ebola while working in Liberia with the aid organization Serving in Mission. Sacra was treating patients in an obstetrics clinic in Monrovia and was not working directly with Ebola patients. He said that he does not know how he became infected with the virus but that it's possible one of the women he helped had the disease. Brantly, who tested negative for the deadly virus after receiving treatment in Atlanta, flew to Nebraska where Sacra was in isolation and donated his blood two weeks ago. Doctors believe Brantly's plasma had antibodies that Sacra needed to help his immune system fight the deadly virus. The Nebraska Medical Center owns one of just a few biocontainment units that exist in the United States. ""I did say, wow, Nebraska? Who made that decision?"" Sacra joked. ""Once I heard about (the biocontainment unit) I was like cool, I've never been to Nebraska."" In addition to the blood transfusion, doctors gave Sacra aggressive supportive care, including electrolytes and IV fluids. The Nebraska doctors also gave Sacra an experimental drug called TKM-Ebola, which the FDA recently approved for wider use. Sacra locked himself in his room for three days when he first came down with a fever in Liberia on August 29. A mobile CDC lab confirmed he had the disease on the third day, and by the sixth he was flying home to the United States. ""I never felt like I was not going to make it,"" he said. ""The care was so excellent, so speedy, so prompt, that I'm just thanking God for that."" Sacra says he is now feeling good, though he's still very weak. He was up to five minutes on a stationary bike he had in his hospital room before being released, but even that tired him out. What happens when you survive Ebola? Sacra has done missionary health work for the past 25 years. He had flown to Monrovia in August after learning his colleagues from Serving in Mission had gotten sick. Sacra worried that Ebola would cause a ""domino effect"" on the already vulnerable Liberian health care system and that people with common ailments wouldn't get help. When Sacra arrived in Monrovia, that's exactly what he found. His wife, Debbie, has said there wasn't a single pair of latex gloves to buy in the entire city. Without protective equipment, medical clinics shut down. She says Sacra drove from hardware store to hardware store, looking for boots to protect his staff. When he was finally able to open the clinic, for some it was too late. She says dozens of pregnant women who needed Cesarean sections turned up at the clinic after having failed to find help anywhere else in the city. By the time these women arrived at Sacra's clinic ""only the mothers' lives could be saved,"" Debbie Sacra said. At the news conference, Rick Sacra thanked everyone around the world who had prayed for him during his time of need and asked for more prayers and practical health for the people of West Africa. ""The Ebola crisis continues to spin out of control,"" he said. He and his wife will return home soon, where Sacra said he hopes to take his dog for a long walk. He knows his recovery will move slowly, as Brantly told him to ""be patient."" But he is not ruling out an eventual return to Liberia, the country he called his second home.","Dr. Rick Sacra, an American Ebola patient in Nebraska, is released from a medical center .

"Los Angeles (CNN)Whatever it was doing up in space, we may never know, but the U.S. Air Force's unmanned X-37B space plane returned to Earth this week, with still no details from the military on the nearly two-year mission. ""The X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle mission 3 (OTV-3),"" as the military calls it, touched down at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on Friday morning after conducting experiments in orbit for 674 days, the military said. Conspiracy theorists endlessly conjecture on what the Pentagon is doing with ""the newest and most advanced re-entry spacecraft."" The Air Force's two vehicles resemble small space shuttles, and have now logged a combined 1,367 days in space, the military said. In the latest mission, the X-37B lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida on December 11, 2012. At the time, the Air Force said its mission would last about nine months. The military has spoken only in generalities about the spacecraft and its mission. ""Technologies being tested in the program include advanced guidance, navigation and control, thermal protection systems, avionics, high temperature structures and seals, conformal reusable insulation, lightweight electromechanical flight systems, and autonomous orbital flight, re-entry and landing,"" an Air Force statement said. Theorists speculate the spacecraft is a space bomber, a spy plane against such targets as the Chinese space station, or merely an experiment as the government states, according to a Popular Mechanics story in 2012. The previous mission of the X-37B, which landed at Vandenberg on June 16, 2012, lasted 469 days, according to the Air Force. That mission was flown by the second of the orbiters. The latest mission is the second for the first of the orbiters, which was refurbished after it spent 224 days in orbit following an April 2010 launch. When the latest mission launched, the Air Force said it might not be the last. ""Officials anticipate multiple missions will be required to satisfy the test program objectives, but the exact number of missions has not been determined,"" a statement said. The X-37B spacecraft is 29 feet, 3 inches long and 9 feet, 6 inches high with a wingspan of 14 feet and 11 inches. It weighs about 5.5 tons. It is lifted into space by United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rockets. CNN's Brad Lendon contributed to this report.","The X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle lands at Vandenberg Air Force Base .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China's change of leadership that began last week comes as domestic pressure mounts for the world's second largest economy to toughen its foreign policy to match its economic might. Yet Beijing is keen to prevent the world from concluding that China has discarded the notion of a peaceful rise. The result has been reactive assertiveness; a foreign policy tactic perfected during China's ongoing maritime disputes. This approach allows Beijing to use perceived provocations as a chance to change the status-quo in its favor -- all the while insisting the other party started the trouble. Those expecting China to turn the other cheek are mistaken. The prolonged stand-off with Japan over the sovereignty of a few islets offers a vivid example of this approach. In September, the Japanese government announced that it was finalizing the purchase from their private owner of the disputed islands -- called Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China -- in the East China Sea. But Beijing interpreted the move as a betrayal of the two countries' agreement to shelve their quarrel, and saw the timing as a deliberate attempt to disrupt the leadership transition and foment instability at a vulnerable moment. Read more: Behind the islands dispute . China responded decisively, with what state media called ""combination punches."" These measures ranged from the verbal -- leader-to-be Xi Jinping labeling Japan's purchase of the islands a ""farce"" -- to economic retaliation and large-scale anti-Japan protests and naval exercises in the East China Sea. But the real game-changer in the stand-off came when Beijing declared its territorial baselines around the islands; a move that legally places them under Chinese administration. Once the announcement was made, China began to regularly dispatch law enforcement vessels to patrol waters off the disputed islands, directly challenging Japan's de facto control of the area for the past 40 years. Such is the new normal, claim Chinese officials. In recent weeks, Chinese media have been trumpeting the efforts of Chinese ships to expel Japanese Coast Guard boats. Reminding the world that the troubles were all started by Tokyo, China claims that the burden is entirely on Japan to find a way out of the mess. Read more: Asia's disputed islands -- who claims what? Similar heavy-handed action was used against the Philippines in a spat over the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea in April. When Manila maladroitly responded to a fishing run-in by sending a warship, China took the opportunity to strengthen its claim over the disputed shoal by deploying law enforcement vessels to the area, extending its annual unilateral fishing ban to cover the waters around the shoal; quarantining tropical fruit imports from the Philippines and suspending tourism; and roping off the mouth of the lagoon to prevent other fishermen from entering. By maintaining regular law enforcement patrols and preventing Filipino fishermen from entering those waters, China has managed to establish a new status-quo in its favor. A similar blueprint was then used in June in response to a maritime law passed by Vietnam with new navigation regulations covering the disputed Spratly and Paracel Islands. Before the ink on the law had dried, China upgraded the administrative status of Sansha city encompassing a group of disputed islands in the South China Sea and established a military garrison. Furthermore, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) offered oil exploration leases in nine blocks located within Vietnam's Exclusive Economic Zone, which overlap with blocks offered by PetroVietnam. A key component of Beijing's counter-punches are the use of economic punishments, including suspending imports, halting tourism, encouraging boycotts, offering up oil blocks in disputed areas, or impeding fishing access. In contrast to a time when foreign policy was designed to serve economic growth, China is now increasingly using its economic might to advance political ends -- even when this hurts China itself. According to one Chinese analyst, ""These measures will hurt China. But they hurt Japan more"". Read more: Shrink wealth gap, boost consumption . For its part, Japan says that it purchased the islands to prevent the hardline Tokyo mayor from acquiring them and carrying out a plan to build there. It also wanted to avoid ""punching the new Chinese leadership in the face"" just after the transition. Now, analysts in Beijing claim that a Pandora's Box has been opened and there is no going back to the tacit agreement that has kept peace in the East China Sea for decades. Read more: Why China's reforms have hit a brick wall . Right now, Beijing is primarily preoccupied with maintaining the momentum of economic development and preventing domestic troubles from erupting into potentially destabilizing unrest. The new leaders will not want to look weak, thus blunting the edge of their ""reactively assertive"" foreign policy. If there is any perceived slight, no matter how minor, expect China to pounce. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt.","China appears to toughen its foreign policy to match its economic might .

"A 70-year-old man in Saudi Arabia is disputing claims his new bride is 15 years old, and says her family has ripped him off for the large dowry he paid for the union. Human rights workers say the bride is a teenager and are outraged about the situation. CNN interviewed the man Tuesday, who said he paid a dowry to the girl's parents for the equivalent of $20,000. The marriage came to light when the man complained to a local official after his new wife left him, saying the girl's family had taken her back and he'd been ripped off. He also claimed that he thought she was 25 years old. He refused to provide his name to CNN. ""She is not 15 as everybody claims,"" he said. ""She's 25 years old and she's mature enough to make her own decisions... I was fooled by the girl's family."" In Saudi Arabia, there is no law that stipulates a minimum age for marriage. Human rights workers say they believe there was a fight between the teen and the man, and she ran back to her family. Her father is believed to be Yemeni, her mother Saudi, the rights workers told CNN. She is from Al-Hurath village in Jizan province, in southwestern Saudi Arabia near the border with Yemen, according to Dr. Hadi Al-Yami, the head of the Asir branch of the Human Rights Commission. The group is backed by the Saudi government. The commission sent an investigator to the courthouse in Al-Hurath, Al-Yami said, and is planning to offer the girl and her family as much help as she's able to receive, particularly legal help in case the courts require her to formally dispute the marriage. Dr. Suhaila Zein al-Abedin of the Saudi National Association for Human Rights -- also a government-backed group -- voiced concern not only about the age difference, but the circumstances of the marriage. ""When you consider the very large difference in age, it looks more like this was not a marriage, but like the girl was sold,"" al-Abedin said. ""The girl's parents need to be held responsible for this."" Some groups, such as the HRC, advocate for setting a minimum age for marriage, though they've not said what age. The group proposes that anyone younger than 18 who wants to get married should get a court's consent. Extremely conservative religious scholars have opposed a law that would govern the age to marry. Messages on social media reflect frustration with that opposition. Prominent Egyptian activist Mona Eltahawy tweeted, ""It's only when there's enough public outrage that we can fight #childmarriage. We are not angry enough to help that 15 y/o & others like her."" Yemeni activist NoonArabia tweeted, ""#ChildMarriage is a violation of human rights http://www.humanrightsdefence.org/child-marriage-as-an-human-rights-issue.html ... #RunAwayBride #PTs."" Other Egyptians took to the Web. Kareem Bassem tweeted, ""#ChildMarriage is a result of dehumanizing female humans and degrading them to 'treats' in alleged paradise. Fight dehumanization!""

"Scientists racing to develop something that will stop the largest Ebola epidemic in history are trying a variety of experimental drugs on patients. Without a cure, the disease has killed at least 3,431 people and infected 7,470 at last count. The first person known to have been diagnosed with the disease on U.S. soil, Thomas Duncan, is receiving a drug called Brincidofovir, according to his nephew Joe Weeks. So is the second Ebola patient to be treated in The Nebraska Medical Center's Biocontainment Unit, freelance cameraman Ashoka Mukpo. ""After looking at the data on this drug, collaborating with the CDC and FDA and speaking with the patient and his family, we decided this was currently our best option for treatment,"" Dr. Phil Smith, medical director of the Biocontainment Unit, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Every patient is somewhat different, and we believe Brincidofovir is the best choice."" The biopharmaceutical company Chimerix got approval from the FDA for emergency use of Brincidofovir on Duncan on Friday.  Duncan is currently in critical condition in Dallas. The experimental antiviral drug was initially being developed to treat life-threatening viruses like smallpox.  But antiviral drugs can be used to treat a wide variety of diseases. This is the same drug that was originally denied to Josh Hardy, a 7-year-old who was treated for cancer and then developed an adenovirus that nearly killed him. In March, his parents launched a social media campaign to get the medicine, and it drew national attention. Josh then received the drug and recovered. After the Ebola outbreak started this spring, Chimerix sent brincidofovir, to be tested against Ebola.  Test-tube data showed positive results. Further tests are being planned. Here's what else is in the pipeline to fight Ebola. 'Extraordinary' race for Ebola vaccine raises ethical questions . ZMapp . Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. is in the early stages of developing its drug, ZMapp. It was given to the Americans taken from Africa to Emory University in Atlanta for treatment in August.  A total of seven patients got the drug, and it seems to have had success. In July, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency gave Mapp additional funding because of the ""promising results."" In animal studies, the therapy seemed to help.  Four monkeys infected with Ebola survived after getting ZMapp within 24 hours after infection. Two others survived after getting the treatment 48 hours after infection. In the Emory patients' cases, Dr. Kent Brantly didn't get the drug until he'd been sick for nine days. After just an hour of receiving the medication, Brantly's condition improved dramatically.  His labored breathing got better, and a rash faded away.  One of his doctors described the transformation as ""miraculous."" Nancy Writebol also received the medication, but her response was not as immediate.  After a second dose of the medicine, her doctors said, there was significant improvement. Since the drug is so new, there are no doses of it left. The Department of Health and Human Services contracted with Mapp to make more for early-stage clinical safety studies. Creating the drug is time-consuming and expensive. Scientists are looking for alternative ways to create it using the tobacco plant.  In August, Kentucky-based BioProcessing started working with Mapp to develop ZMapp using its plants. TKM-Ebola . This year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the experimental TKM-Ebola drug to test on suspected cases of the infection. TKM-Ebola was used on Dr. Richard Sacra, the patient taken from Africa to Nebraska for treatment in September.  He had been working as a doctor in Liberia when he became infected. The drug is made by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, a Canadian company. Studies in 2010 funded in part by the U.S. Department of Defense's Joint Project Manager Transformational Medical Technologies office showed ""100 percent protection from an otherwise lethal dose of Zaire Ebola virus,"" according to Tekmira's website. In January, Tekmira started phase I clinical trials on the drug, testing it on a small number of human subjects. Testing was put on hold after a volunteer developed moderate gastrointestinal side effects after getting a high dose of the medicine. In August, the FDA modified its status to a ""partial clinical hold"" so Tekmira could give the drug to doctors or hospitals that requested it in emergencies like Sacra's. In March, the FDA gave the drug a fast track designation, allowing the testing process to be sped up.  Tekmira was also given the authority to use it under the investigational new drug application rule, so patients could be treated outside a clinical trial. A vaccine . The National Institutes of Health started human testing of a vaccine to prevent Ebola in early September. The U.S. Department of Defense is working with a company to develop a vaccine as well. After an expedited review by the FDA, researchers were allowed to start a human safety trial.  Because there is such an urgent need for a vaccine, the FDA waived some of the preclinical studies that are normally required. The vaccine was created by GlaxoSmithKline and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. It's being tested in the United States and will be tested in healthy volunteers in the United Kingdom, Mali and Gambia. The National Institutes of Health is also in talks with health leaders in Nigeria, which has seen 20 cases, to test the vaccine on people there. An international consortium that formed to fight the epidemic gave money to the company to make up to 10,000 additional doses of the vaccine while the trials are ongoing. Another vaccine developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, licensed to Iowa-based NewLink Genetics, is also about to start trials. It will be tested at the Clinical Trials Center at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.  That trial should start in mid-October.  The process is being accelerated, and the FDA will be monitoring the results to see whether it can move into the next phase. The Canadian government shipped 800 to 1,000 doses of the vaccine to Liberia at the government's request.  An earlier version of that vaccine had been given to a German lab worker in 2009 after he thought he pricked himself with a needle that had the Ebola virus on it.  He did not get sick. A third vaccine developed by the National Institutes of Health was tested in primates. It showed success in the animal study, in combination with Depovax, an adjuvant used with other vaccines to boost the body's immune response. Other alternatives . A doctor in Liberia is trying an HIV drug called lamivudine. Dr. Gorbee Logan has given the drug to 15 patients; all but two survived.  Compared with the 70% mortality rate in West Africa, those are good odds. The drug can cause liver problems and has other side effects, but the doctor said it has been worth it in light of the disease's deadliness. Scientists in Thailand believe they've found a new type of antibody that is effective against the virus. The team of doctors at Siriraj Hospital are confident that it will work and the side effects will be low, but it has not been tested in animals or humans and is at least a year away at least from being developed.","Scientists are using an experimental drug, Brincidofovir, on two Ebola patients .

"The Netherlands' first ever clinic for assisted suicide and euthanasia has opened and includes a mobile service for those who wish to die at home. Its launch made headlines, and the clinic received 60 applications in the first two days of operation -- mostly from terminally ill patients -- but the Levenseinde Kliniek (End of Life Clinic) in Amsterdam has yet to euthanize a single patient. ""No, of course not!"" exclaimed spokeswoman Walburg de Jong, laughing in shock at the notion. ""It's not that you can go to the clinic and say, 'well, I want to die,' and then tomorrow someone is coming."" The U.S. presidential campaign oddly put euthanasia in the Netherlands into the news limelight in February, after Republican candidate Rick Santorum criticized it to make an argument against socialized medicine. Santorum has made death at the hands of a Dutch family doctor sound much easier to come by than the clinic's spokeswoman or the Netherlands' health ministry. The candidate claimed that in the Netherlands physicians euthanize elderly Dutch patients against their will to hold down medical costs. ""Half the people who are euthanized in the Netherlands -- and it's ten percent of all deaths for the Netherlands -- half of those people are euthanized involuntarily at hospitals, because they are older and sick,"" Santorum said at an appearance at a conservative rally in Columbia, Missouri on February 3, 2012. Santorum's rant set off indignant reactions in the media in the Netherlands, including headlines of a Labor party politician demanding the Dutch ambassador or the country's foreign minister rebut the U.S. candidate. ""Rick Santorum thinks he knows the Netherlands: massive murder of the elderly,"" read a headline in the February 18 edition of the Dutch daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad. Almost 140,000 people die in the Netherlands per year, according to the CIA World Factbook. The intentional ending of life with a doctor's help accounts for about 3,000 of those deaths, according to the Netherlands Ministry of Health -- percentage mathematics would land at a figure of under 2.5%, far lower than Santorum's numbers. Santorum has also claimed that elderly people wear bracelets in the Netherlands reading ""Do not euthanize me,"" a claim de Jong has refuted. CNN reached out to Santorum, whose campaign is in high gear, via his press representatives to inquire into the source of the Republican candidate's statistics.  As of press time, there has been no on-the-record response. The New England Journal of Medicine has published percentages of doctor-assisted death at a patient's request in the Netherlands, and they range from 1.7% and 2.6% of all deaths in the country. It also placed the percentage of patients dying in palliative care at 7%. Palliative and hospice care are common end-of-life treatment alternatives in many countries, including the U.S.A. Its not clear if Santorum was including palliative and hospice care when he said 10% of all deaths in the Netherlands are the result of euthanasia. Those seeking medical help to quell their suffering by ending their lives have to take a long road to get it, according to the Dutch health ministry, and the majority of patient requests -- a full two-thirds -- are denied. The patient must first convince his doctor that his suffering is unbearable. His ailment must be incurable. ""The criteria are that there must be a reoccurring voluntary request,"" clinic spokeswoman de Jong said. ""There must be an unbearable and hopeless suffering, no alternatives anymore, and there must also be a second opinion doctor, who says 'yes, this doctor is fulfilling the criteria.' And then the euthanasia or assisted suicide can be done."" Sometimes the patient dies while waiting for the euthanasia to pass approval. Under the Dutch definition, euthanasia is when a doctor administers a lethal dose of a medication to end a patient's life at the patient's request. Assisted suicide is when the doctor acquires the deadly dose for the patient, who then administers it on him- or herself. Commonly used medications to hasten life's end are muscle relaxers and barbiturates. Then there are the legal hurdles. ""Euthanasia is still a criminal offence,"" a statement on the foreign ministry website explains the Netherlands stance on the topic to the world. But doctors are exempt from prosecution, if they follow a strict set of criteria laid down by a 2002 law, the Dutch Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide Act. ""Patients have no absolute right to euthanasia and doctors no absolute duty to perform it,"" the ministry says. ""A doctor's main duty is indeed to preserve life."" ""On the other hand,"" it adds, ""they have a duty to relieve the patient's suffering."" The doctor, it seems, would be between a rock and a hard place. After helping terminate the life, a doctor must report it as a death by unnatural causes to the coroner's office, where it faces review by a legal expert, a doctor and an ethics expert. If they don't like what they see, the case is forwarded to the Public Prosecution Service. Add this tension to other more personal qualms, and many doctors just won't give that lethal dose. Enter the brand new End of Life Clinic -- founded by the advocacy group ""Right to Die NL,"" for which de Jong is also the spokeswoman. ""People are dependent on their doctors, and when you have a doctor who doesn't want to do it, sometimes you have no one to turn to,"" de Jong said. ""The biggest doctors' organization in the Netherlands says that every doctor has the moral obligation to refer to another doctor, when he doesn't want to do it,"" she continued. ""But there are also doctors who don't want to refer to another doctor. Therefore this clinic can be a possibility for those people."" Once the patient opts for the help of one of the End of Life Clinic's doctors, it can still take a long time for the end to come. By law, the doctor who carries out the euthanasia or assisted suicide must be considered the patient's attending physician. The clinic declined to let CNN interview one of its participating doctors or nurses, who are everyday medical professionals and work for the clinic part-time. De Jong said she was afraid patients would snow the clinicians at their private practices with euthanasia requests due to the publicity. After the patient has filed a request, ""a doctor and a nurse will look whether they can fulfill the criteria,"" de Jong said. Then they contact the patient, his relatives and the attending physician for a series of conversations. These can last as short as two weeks, if a patient's prognosis and suffering are obvious -- or as long as a year, de Jong said. ""People talk about it too late and then discover that their doctor won't do it,"" de Jong warned. Right to Die NL encourages its 130,000 members to make a living will, which includes end of life plans, ahead of time. The vast majority of patients -- about ten times as many as receive euthanasia or assisted suicide -- end up with the palliative alternative of heavy sedation, while waiting for the end to come naturally, according to a 2005 academic review of the euthanasia law and its consequences. A possible side effect of that sedation is the hastening of death. But with all the considerations, in 2005 doctors in the Netherlands reported helping 2,425 patients who voluntarily decided they wanted to end their lives and 3,136 in 2010. There is some truth to Rick Santorum's claim that some patients' lives are taken without consent, but at a lower rate than five percent of all deaths in the Netherlands, as the presidential candidate had said. The 2005 report placed the number at 550 deaths. It tends to be patients in palliative care, who are unconscious, which means the doctor can't ask what the patient wants, de Jong said. ""And maybe the doctor did something he shouldn't do."" ""But I think this is a problem everywhere in the world."" There are also newborns, children and teenagers who are euthanized in accordance with strict legal protocol and parental involvement, which include that ""suffering must be unbearable and with no prospect of improvement."" Teenagers over 16 years of age are allowed to make the request without parental approval but require their consultation. People plagued with psychiatric illness also request and receive help ending their lives, although it is discouraged. ""The first priority in responding to such requests is to explore the prospects of an improvement in the patient's quality of life,"" according the foreign ministry. The overwhelming majority of cases of doctor assisted end-of-life care are easier to understand than those involving children or psychiatric patients. ""Experience shows that in practice the vast majority of cases of euthanasia (almost 90%) relate to patients with terminal cancer,"" according to the foreign ministry. A 2010 review commission report revealed terminal cancer at the root of the overwhelming majority of cases. Even with its humane intentions, such open dealings with euthanasia and assisted suicide as it is practiced in the Netherlands may rub many cultures the wrong way. Dutch authorities are aware of this. ""Dutch law on euthanasia is not incompatible with international conventions and the fundamental human rights they enshrine, such as the right to life laid down in article 6 of the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,"" a statement reads on the foreign ministry's website. ""The Dutch government vigorously endorses these rights, but does not believe that a request to end life made by someone experiencing unbearable suffering without the prospect of improvement should be refused solely on those grounds."" De Jong anticipates that the End of Life Clinic's mobile team may become active as soon as this week ""to visit a patient, and of course they are also to consult the doctor of the patient."" The clinic's mobile team does not have any kind of special vehicle like an ambulance, de Jong said. The doctors and nurses simply drive their own cars. In some scenarios, de Jong says, the clinic's focus is not on euthanizing the patient as much as it is on ensuring the doctor feels comfortable committing to the process. ""They want to take him by the hand in the process and maybe afterwards or in the process he can say, 'Well, I can do it myself,' or afterwards he can say, 'The second time I can do it myself.'""","The Netherlands' first ever euthanasia clinic opens and includes mobile service .

"A  U.S. soldier imprisoned for leaking documents to WikiLeaks broke her silence in a fiery editorial accusing the United States of lying about Iraq. Chelsea Manning was sentenced  to 35 years in prison in 2013 for leaking 750,000 pages of classified documents to the anti-secrecy group. At the time,  Manning went by the first name Bradley, but later announced the desire to live as a woman and be known as Chelsea. Manning has stayed out of the limelight since the conviction, which spared the former intelligence analyst from the most serious charge of aiding the enemy. But she was back Saturday, with an opinion piece titled 'The Fog Machine of War"" in The New York Times. In it, she accuses the U.S. media of looking the other way when chaos and corruption reigned in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""As Iraq erupts in civil war and America again contemplates intervention, that unfinished business should give new urgency to the question of how the United States military controlled the media coverage of its long involvement there and in Afghanistan,"" Manning wrote. ""I believe that the current limits on press freedom and excessive government secrecy make it impossible for Americans to grasp fully what is happening in the wars we finance."" She said that during the 2010 elections in Iraq, the media duped the world  into thinking that all was well. ""You might remember that the American press was flooded with stories declaring the elections a success, complete with upbeat anecdotes and photographs of Iraqi women proudly displaying their ink-stained fingers,"" she wrote. ""The subtext was that United States military operations had succeeded in creating a stable and democratic Iraq. Those of us stationed there were acutely aware of a more complicated reality."" She said at the time, she got regular reports detailing security forces' crackdown against dissidents ""on behalf"" of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. ""I was shocked by our military's complicity in the corruption of that election,"" she said. ""Yet these deeply troubling details flew under the American media's radar."" Sunni militant fighters are vowing to capture cities in Iraq  and threatening the government of al-Maliki. Some Iraqi security forces, most of whom were trained by the United States, have bolted their posts in areas overrun by militants. U.S. President Barack Obama has said he will not send troops to Iraq, but is considering other options. ""This is not going to happen overnight,"" the President said Friday. He added that unless Iraq fixes its internal political problems, short-term military help from the United States won't make much difference. Pressure for the United States to provide military support to Iraq's struggling government has increased, with conservative Republicans blaming Obama for creating a security vacuum in 2011 by pulling out U.S. troops. GOP critics also say that Obama's unwillingness to provide significant military backing to opposition forces in Syria's civil war has made it easier for the militant Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, to attack in Iraq. Obama, however, has resisted getting drawn into another military engagement there after the ending the nine-year conflict started by his predecessor. Manning also slammed the practice of embedding journalists with the military. ""Reporters naturally fear having their access terminated, so they tend to avoid controversial reporting that could raise red flags,"" Manning wrote.

"Japan is using YouTube to bolster assertions of ownership over islands also claimed by neighboring China and South Korea. Japan's Foreign Ministry published the two videos on its official YouTube channel, under the username MOFAchannel, October 16. In one, Tokyo's claim over the Senkaku islands -- known as the Diaoyu islands in China -- are supported through old black-and-white photographs and a timeline of events starting with a document dating back to 1895. In the other, similar pictures and a chronology of events starting from 1900 illustrate Japan's claim to the Takeshima islands, known as the Dokdo islands in Korean. Both videos have received more than half a million page views since they were published. China and South Korea both criticized Japan's social media push. ""The Diaoyu Islands and other affiliated islands have always been Chinese territory. China has solid evidence to prove this,"" the Chinese government stressed in an official statement. ""No matter what propaganda measures Japan takes, it will not change the fact that the Diaoyu Islands belong to China. We strongly urge Japan to correct its attitude and stop all kinds of provocative acts."" In South Korea, lawmakers from the country's major parties vowed to counter Japan's ""provocative"" moves, according to the semi-official Yonhap news agency. South Korea's foreign ministry also demanded Tokyo take down its Dokdo island video and summoned a Japanese diplomatic official to lodge a formal complaint. In reply, Tokyo has said the videos will remain -- and its Foreign Ministry plans to produce videos on the Kuril islands claimed by Russia and on the official name of the Sea of Japan, according to Japan's Kyodo news.

Is that supposed to make Rice's actions or Brown's actions somehow less violent? Or criminal? Why I stayed: Tangles of domestic abuse . The worst part for me, though, was when Doocy and Kilmeade started joking: ""I think the message is, take the stairs,"" Kilmeade said. Doocy responded with, ""The message is when you're in an elevator, there's a camera."" Does that mean it's OK to deck your gal if no one is around to see it? I don't think Kilmeade and Doocy meant it that way, but it was those comments that wormed their way under my skin. And I wasn't alone. Ray Rice video prompts stories of #WhyIStayed, #WhyILeft . As Jan Langbein, who runs the Genesis Women's Center, told me, the whole episode is a form of victim-blaming. ""I'm horrified,"" Langbein said. ""I mean 'take the stairs,' please! I am constantly surrounded by messages that it's somehow her fault of or that if she had taken the stairs or done something else or not worn that outfit the abuse wouldn't have happened. It's not about her actions at all."" If you want to know why some domestic violence survivors return to their abusers -- here's a thought -- ask them. You want to know why I never told the authorities, or my family, that a college boyfriend threw me against a wall and knocked me out? Because, at 20, I thought I deserved it. Some of my girlfriends made me feel that way. My boyfriend certainly did. I was ashamed. You want to know why I agreed to see him again after he assaulted me? Because when all was said and done I could not believe the charming, handsome man I chose to be with could hurt me again. I quickly discovered I was wrong about that and I left him. The National Domestic Violence Hotline says it takes women seven times to leave an abusive partner for good. There are 50 different reasons for that and none of them are simple, although some are downright frightening. Langbein said the most dangerous time for a victim of domestic violence is the day she leaves her abusive partner for good. Abusers are all about control. And when they lose control, they become more dangerous. There's a reason that one-third of female homicide victims are killed by their current or former partners. So, please, shut up. Domestic violence is a serious crime perpetrated by a violent partner. And, you know what? It rarely happens in front of a camera.","Carol Costello says there should be no tolerance for blaming victims in domestic violence .

"It's the biggest man-made epidemic in the United States. That's how a doctor in  Washington state described it to me as we sat outside the state Capitol in Olympia. He was talking about accidental death from prescription drug overdoses. The doctor, Gary Franklin, medical director for Washington state's Department of Labor and Industries, recounted terrifying case after case and told me it was the saddest thing he had ever seen. I remember him telling me about a teenager dying because he had taken too much narcotic medication after a dental procedure. The most common scenario, he said, involves a man in his 40s or 50s who visits a doctor with a backache and walks out with a pain pill prescription. About three years later, typically, the man dies in his sleep from taking too many pills, or mixing them with alcohol. They don't intend to die, but more than 20,000 times a year -- every 19 minutes, on average -- that is exactly what happens. Accidental overdoses are now a leading cause of accidental deaths in the United States, surpassing car crashes. As a neurosurgeon working in a busy level 1 trauma hospital, I had an idea that the problem was growing -- but the numbers still boggle the mind. Distribution of morphine, the main ingredient in popular painkillers, increased 600% from 1997-2007, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. In the United States, we now prescribe enough pain pills to give every man, woman and child one every four hours, around the clock, for three weeks. Gupta: The truth about prescription medication addiction . We often pay close attention if a celebrity dies of an overdose, but truth is, it's our friends, neighbors and yes, our own family members who are dying. In fact, the person who really brought the issue to my attention was former President Bill Clinton. He called me a few months ago, and I could immediately tell he was broken up about something. I had worked for him in the White House in the late '90s, talked to him countless times since then, and I had never heard him like this. Two of his friends had both lost sons, he told me. The cause: accidental overdose. I will never forget how he put it. ""Look, no one thinks having a few beers and an Oxycontin is a good idea, but you also don't expect to die."" I knew at that moment we needed to do our part in the media to shine a bright light on this issue and find solutions that work. As a starting point, 80% of the world's pain pills are consumed right here in the United States, according to 2011 congressional testimony from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians. No doubt, many are for perfectly legitimate reasons and are not misused or abused. Yet culturally, we have become increasingly intolerant of even minor amounts of pain and increasingly comfortable with taking heavy-duty medications. We know, however, that after just a few months of taking the pills, something starts to change in the body. The effectiveness wears off, and patients typically report getting only about 30% pain relief, compared with when they started. Even more concerning, a subgroup of these patients develop a condition known as hyperalgesia, an increased sensitivity to pain. Gupta: More is not always better in medicine . As you might guess, all of this creates a situation where the person starts to take more and more pills. And even though they are no longer providing much pain relief, they can still diminish the body's drive to breathe. If you are awake you may not notice it, but if you fall asleep with too many of these pills in your system, you never wake up. Add alcohol, and the problem is exponentially worse. People who take pain or sleeping pills and drink a couple glasses of wine are playing Russian roulette. I am not at all sorry for coming off dramatic or scary as I write this. I only wish I had been this dramatic years ago. Truth is, it is easier for a doctor to write a prescription than to explore other effective options to combat pain. And it is easier for patients to take those prescription pills than to search for alternatives themselves. Both those things must absolutely change. In my upcoming documentary, I will explain how we arrived in this deadly situation, but more importantly, explore solutions to address it. I crisscrossed the country finding what worked and what didn't. I spoke to doctors, patients and families who lost a loved one -- even one man I met who shares my last name. As I said, it hits close to home. Clinton has dedicated a significant part of his post-presidency domestic efforts to this cause, and it will not come as a surprise that he has identified areas where we can all make a difference. You will hear his thoughts on this issue for the first time in the documentary. Throughout my career, I have traveled the world and seen problems so intransigent that I thought solutions would never come. With accidental deaths due to prescription drugs, however, we have an opportunity to fix the problem and end this large man-made epidemic.

"(CNN) -- Computer hackers supporting WikiLeaks shifted targets Thursday from Amazon to PayPal, they said, as Dutch authorities announced an arrest in connection with hacker attacks on the websites of MasterCard and Visa. The Dutch High Tech Crimes unit arrested a 16-year-old in The Hague, Netherlands, with prosecutors saying he confessed to attacks on the websites. ""He is probably part of a larger group of hackers, who are under continued investigation,"" they said. The teen is due in court Friday in Rotterdam. Separately, a group of hackers calling themselves Anonymous Operations said they would attack PayPal, not Amazon.com, about an hour after an attack on Amazon was due to start. ""We can not attack Amazon, currently. The previous schedule was to do so, but we don't have enough forces,"" they said on Twitter. Anonymous Operations released a do-it-yourself hacking tool earlier Thursday so supporters could make their own computers part of the attack. The Amazon.com attack was supposed to have started at about 11 a.m. ET. So far, PayPal appears to be operating normally. The site has been attacked, which has slowed it down but has ""not significantly impacted payments,"" PayPayl's Anuj Nayar told CNN. Amazon.com has massive server capacity -- much more than that of Mastercard or Visa -- in order to handle the holiday e-commerce rush. Its server infrastructure ensures that a massive traffic spike can't take site down, whether it comes from a hacker-led attack or genuine shoppers. Anonymous Operations released the hacking tool on Twitter and called for followers to translate it into other languages. Hackers have been targeting websites of organizations they see as hostile to WikiLeaks and its Editor-in-Chief Julian Assange, who was arrested in London this week on allegations unconnected to the website's publication of secret documents. Amazon used to host WikiLeaks' website in the United States, but shut it down last week, saying it had violated their terms of service by publishing material it did not own and which could cause harm. PayPal stopped handling donations to WikiLeaks last week. The United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights said Thursday that pressure on websites to cut off WikiLeaks could violate the site's right to freedom of expression. ""I'm concerned about reports of pressure exerted on private companies, including banks, credit card companies, to close down credit lines for donations to WikiLeaks as well as to stop hosting the website or its mirror sites,"" Navi Pillay said in Geneva, Switzerland . ""They could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information,"" she said at a press conference. ""If WikiLeaks has committed any recognizable illegal acts, then this should be handled through the legal system and not through pressure and intimidation including on third parties."" Anonymous Operations members told CNN Thursday their goal was ""freedom of information. Any and all information."" They were originally focused on piracy, but shifted their attention to WikiLeaks because it was ""obvious we had to help."" ""While their methods may be controversial, they do demand transparency, which is something we definitely support,"" they said, adding that once they feel they have made their point about WikiLeaks, they will go back to fighting for ""unlimited freedom of expression."" They spoke to CNN Correspondent Atika Shubert in an online chat after being contacted through Twitter. WikiLeaks said Thursday it was not associated with Anonymous Operations and neither supported nor condemned their actions. ""This group is not affiliated with WikiLeaks. There has been no contact between any WikiLeaks staffer and anyone at Anonymous. WikiLeaks has not received any prior notice of any of Anonymous' actions,"" it said on its website. ""We neither condemn nor applaud these attacks. We believe they are a reflection of public opinion on the actions of the targets,"" WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said. The hackers have been attacking sites with a relatively simple tool called a low orbit ion cannon (LOIC). Users who put it on their computer are allowing Anonymous Operations to use the machine to launch attacks on a chosen target, computer security expert Mikko Hypponen told CNN. He hasn't seen any obvious code in the tool that would allow Anonymous Operations to use people's computers for other purposes, he said. Because people cut and paste the code off a website, rather than downloading it, there's no way to tell how many people have put the tool on their computers. One person who put the hacking tool on his computer told CNN it was the arrest of Assange that ""sparked this global movement. ""If he was not arrested, I doubt that the movement would have grown to its current unstoppable size,"" said the computer user, who refused to give his name but said he was not a hacker. The website of the lawyer representing the women who accuse Assange of sex attacks in Sweden went down on Thursday, said the office of the lawyer, Claes Borgstrom. The Swedish Prosecution Authority's website was down earlier in the week. Anonymous Operations told CNN it had carried out that attack. The Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported that government's website also went down for a few hours, but the government refused to comment, saying it did not discuss security matters. And a website has been set up in the name of Swedish Justice Minister Beatrice Ask -- but it automatically redirects users to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks founder Assange is being held in a London jail as the British courts decide whether to extradite him to Sweden to face questioning. He has not been charged with a crime. CNN's Francesca Church, Nicola Hughes, David DeSola, Richard Allen Greene, Per Nyberg, Robyn Turner, Julianne Pepitone and Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","NEW: The U.N.

"Congressional leaders agreed Thursday on the need for a full investigation of what one called a recent ""cascade"" of leaked classified information but differed on exactly how the inquiry should be conducted. After meeting with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, the top Democrats and Republicans on the intelligence committees of the House and Senate pledged a bipartisan effort to halt the leaks now and pass legislative changes to prevent future leaks. However, the chairwoman of the Senate panel, Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California, was reluctant to immediately seek a special prosecutor to investigate the leaks involving a cyberwarfare program against Iran and other intelligence matters. The House panel chairman, Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, made clear he believed an outside investigation was necessary. CNN's Toobin: Obama has been 'very tough' on leakers . Meanwhile, an intelligence source told CNN that Clapper wants more government employees to be subject to an enhanced lie detector test as a deterrent to leaking classified information. In particular, Clapper wants to widen the numbers of people across government agencies who would be required to take the ""counterintelligence polygraph,"" the source said. The move would be aimed at government employees who hold top-secret clearance. As of now, not everyone with that clearance level is required to take the enhanced  polygraph, which, the source said, would have questions added such as whether the employee has passed information to journalists. Clapper and ""every member of the leadership team in the intelligence community"" are angry about the series of leaks, Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the Senate panel, said after Thursday's meeting. The meeting came amid bipartisan outrage over a report in The New York Times last week that provided classified details of what it described as a U.S cyberattack targeting Iran's nuclear centrifuge program. Some Republicans led by veteran Sen. John McCain of Arizona alleged that the White House must be knowingly involved because of the nature of the leaked information. The White House rejects the accusations. Pelosi: McCain's claims on leaks 'a sad statement' ""Any suggestion that the White House has leaked sensitive information for political purposes has no basis in fact and has been denied by the authors themselves,"" National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said Thursday. The intelligence committee leaders met later Thursday with FBI Director Robert Mueller, whose agency is investigating the leaks, according to legislators. Afterward, Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that the U.S. attorney in Washington also is investigating. After the briefing from Clapper, the four committee leaders said they were united in their commitment to address the problem. ""To have all four of us come forward today and talk about the severity of these leaks, I hope, sends a very clear message about how dangerous this has become,"" Rogers said. Analysts: 'The ship of state always leaks' He pushed for an outside investigation, saying that ""if we're going to make this nonpartisan, if we're going to make this fair and complete, which means it has to follow the leads which they have, you're going to have to have at least some sort of an outside look."" In particular, Rogers noted problems uncovered in his panel's investigation of an unspecified leak, saying the committee ""has materials suggesting that the agencies were directed to expand the scope of classified information they gave to the press."" ""We know, in some cases, someone from a segment of the media was present in a classified setting,"" Rogers said without elaborating. Feinstein, when asked whether a special prosecutor should be appointed, said she was more concerned with adding restrictions on access to classified information and other steps to an intelligence appropriations measure now before the committee. ""A special prosecutor can take years. We don't have years,"" Feinstein said, adding that she was ""delaying that decision."" Intel chief plans more lie detectoring testing to deter leaks . While the cyberwarfare report brought this week's public condemnation, the issue touches on a longstanding dispute between Congress and the federal government over intelligence information. ""This charge is made in every administration,"" Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Thursday. ""Sometimes it's accurate. Sometimes it should lead to accountability and sanctions, but I think we're at the very early stages of this."" Other recent possible leaks of classified information included details on the administration's efforts to expand its drone program and President Barack Obama's involvement in ""kill lists"" against militants in Yemen and Pakistan. Also, the public airing of details surrounding a recently disrupted bomb plot in Yemen by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula angered intelligence and national security officials. ""There is no more important issue that we have to work on than this issue,"" Chambliss said. He and his colleagues said the leaks put lives at risk and damage the credibility of the United States in the intelligence community. FBI becomes involved . Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House panel, said a cultural change was needed that would require a partnership between the administration and both chambers of Congress. The Senate panel is expected to add leak provisions to the fiscal year 2013 intelligence authorization bill this month. Although the House has passed a version of the bill without the leak provisions, they would probably be added during negotiations with the Senate on a final version. In its report Friday, The New York Times said that, since shortly after he became president, Obama has ordered cyberattacks targeting computers that run Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. It attributed the information to participants in the program. McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, alleged that the White House authorized the leaks for political gain. ""These leaks clearly were not done in the interest of national security or to reveal corrupt or illegal actions about which the public has a right to know, as in the case of legitimate whistleblowers,"" McCain said. ""It is difficult to escape the conclusion that these recent leaks of highly classified information, all of which have the effect of making the president look strong and decisive on national security in the middle of his re-election campaign, have a deeper political motivation."" ""This administration has been blatantly political on all national security issues that I've been observing,"" McCain told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday. ""I think it's very clear that these leaks came from people within the White House itself and these people are very politically oriented."" He, too, called for a special counsel to look into the matter. The White House pushed back, with spokesman Jay Carney saying that ""this administration takes all appropriate and necessary steps to prevent leaks of classified information or sensitive information that could risk ongoing counterterrorism or intelligence operations."" Since Obama took office in January 2009, his administration has greatly increased use of the Espionage Act to prosecute alleged leakers of classified information. Six prosecutions have been launched under the act by the administration, which is double the total from all previous administrations, according to Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. Carney said Thursday that Obama ""has demonstrated his commitment to transparency through the variety of steps he has taken, unprecedented in American presidential administration history. ""But he is also president and commander in chief, and he will not countenance the leaking of classified information that can harm our men and women in uniform, harm Americans who work on our national security, harm counterterrorism operations,"" Carney said.","White House ""blatantly political"" on national security issues, McCain says .

"(CNN) -- Formula One will pay its respects to the 239 people who went missing aboard Flight 370 ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix.

Before the race at the Sepang Circuit, teams, drivers and officials are planning a host of tributes to the passengers. The race track neighbors Kuala Lumpur's main airport where the plane took off on March 8. F1 officials and race organizers were due to meet on Thursday to discuss how best to honor those thought lost in the tragedy. But Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton has already tweeted a picture of his car bearing the hashtag ""#PrayForMH370"" along with the message: ""All my prayers and sympathies go to the friends and families of the passengers on MH370 flight.""

"At long last, this Earth Day we celebrate the true dawn of the Solar Age.  That sunrise is hastened, here and abroad, by the slow demise of the once-touted ""too-cheap-to-meter"" Atomic Age of nuclear power. As utilities find nuclear power less and less cost effective, new solar photovoltaic installations in the United States are springing up. New solar installations in 2013 reached a record 4.2 gigawatts, bringing the total to 10. On average, one gigawatt of solar photovoltaics powers 164,000 U.S. homes. That means power for 1.6 million homes. Worldwide, in 2013, solar power installations grew by 38 gigawatts, from 96  to 134. According to the World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2013, in the preceding year, 45 gigawatts of wind and 32 gigawatts of solar power were installed worldwide, compared with a net addition of just 1.2 gigawatts of nuclear. Hastening this energy revolution is the nuclear industry's Achilles heel: an aging, dangerous reactor fleet that is increasingly uncompetitive and new reactor designs that are too expensive to build. Last year, utilities permanently shuttered five more reactors, lowering the number of operating units in the United States to fewer than 100 for the first time in two decades.  Utility owners canceled at least nine planned upgrades of existing reactors, deeming the investments no longer economically justifiable. Additionally, nine planned new nuclear reactors were axed in 2013, an indication of how rapidly things have changed.  Just five years ago, utilities applied for licenses to construct at least 27 new reactors.  By the close of 2013, only four of those reactor projects were still alive. Opinion: Want green cities? Lose the cars . Ironically, Warren Buffett, arguably the world's greatest capitalist, has emerged as the poster child for this dramatic shift.   In June 2013,  Buffett's MidAmerican utility threw in the towel after a failed three-year legislative battle to require Iowa electric customers to foot the bill for the design and construction of a prototype small modular reactor.  Mainstream groups like AARP vigorously opposed that fiscally imprudent investment.  Earlier, MidAmerican canceled another proposed reactor in Idaho on the grounds it was not worth the money. What's significant about this about-face on nuclear by the highly regarded ""Oracle of Omaha"" is that Buffett instead decided to install 656 large wind turbines at a cost of $1.9 billion in Iowa, and has gone ""all-in"" with multibillion dollar bets on utility-scale wind and solar power and other renewable energy facilities throughout the West. Not just Wall Street wizards are shifting investment outlooks and strategies.  Regulators and industry officials alike exude confidence that this is the era for solar, wind and other green energy technologies.  In August 2013, John Wellinghoff, then chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, observed that ""solar is growing so fast it is going to overtake everything ... It could double every two years."" In his annual State of the Union address in January, President Obama highlighted this auspicious trend by praising solar's rapid growth, announcing that, ""every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar. ..."" While nuclear has flat-lined in the marketplace, statistics demonstrating solar's growth actually underestimate the total contribution to our country's electrical supply from solar.  This is because nonutility and small-scale -- residential and commercial rooftop -- photovoltaic systems don't show up as electric generation in the industry's statistics. The utilities that compile generation statistics view rooftop solar electricity, used on site, not as power generation but as a reduction in demand!  If it's not sold by a utility, it's not ""real"" power. In fact, one of the authors built a six-story office building in Seattle that produced more electricity on its roof last year than it used.  If this can be done in Seattle, the cloudiest major city in the contiguous 48 states, it can be done anywhere. In 2013, America, and the world, crossed the threshold to a sustainable, ultimately nonnuclear, carbon-free energy future. While much remains to be done and there is a long way to go, this Earth Day is especially meaningful and inspiring for those of us who have spent our careers pursuing this essential goal.  We can see the clear outline of a sustainable energy future that our children, our economy and our planet can live with.","Writers: On Earth Day we celebrate the dawn of the Solar Age, decline of nuclear power .

"(CNN) -- He's just 15 and the world is seemingly already at his feet. Last month, Martin Odegaard became Norway's youngest international footballer in a friendly against the United Arab Emirates, provoking huge media interest and the hungry attention of Europe's top clubs. Such is the focus on the midfielder that 35 scouts from some of those teams -- including Manchester United and Liverpool of the English Premier League -- came to watch him at a recent Under-21 match. ""In the beginning it was unreal and a little bit surreal that all these clubs wanted Martin, but it's strange what you can get used to,"" his father Hans Erik Odegaard tells CNN. ""Almost every top European club has been in touch."" His international debut is not Odegaard's only record-breaking feat this year. In April he became the youngest player in the history of the Tippeligaen when he made his debut for Stromsgodset in a top-flight game against Aalesund. He followed that up by scoring the fourth goal in a 4-1 win over Sarpsborg to become the youngest scorer in the Norwegian league. Former Norway international Morten Gamst Pedersen has described Odegaard's potential as ""unbelievable,"" while manager Ronny Deila -- who gave the teen his Stromsgodset debut before joining Scottish club Celtic -- says he can ""become the best in the world."" Odegaard's father, a former footballer at Stromsgodset and Sandefjord, recalls the moment when he realized his son might have what it takes to play professionally. ""I saw from a very early age that 'he had the feeling,' but I remember very well when I knew he'd be quite good,"" he said. ""I was still playing and Martin must have been no more than eight. I was out on the pitch running some intervals. He was, as always, with me. When I was finished I wanted to go home, but we couldn't before he had done 50 more shots (at goal). ""Then I understood he also had a talent for training and that is the most important talent you can have."" ""Quite good"" probably doesn't do Odegaard's myriad talents justice, given he has been compared to Lionel Messi or -- closer to Scandinavia -- the legendary Denmark international Michael Laudrup, who played for Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid. ""I'm sure you can compare him with many, but I don't like to do that,"" reflects Hans Erik. ""Those players are and were so good and Martin is at the start of his career."" Former Monaco chief executive Tor-Kristian Karlsen, who is Norwegian and has watched Odegaard's progress over the last few months, is a fan. ""He's obviously still in the early stages of his development but his understanding of the game is very impressive,"" says Karlsen. ""He plays in bursts, so you might not notice him for five minutes, but he has good movement and can take people on."" Young, gifted and talented . Books such as Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers,"" Geoff Colvin's ""Talent is Overrated"" and ""The Talent Code"" by Daniel Coyle all explore the idea that to become an expert you need to practice any skill for 10,000 hours. What's clear from Odegaard's prodigious development is that his success has been helped by a specialized training regime and his thirst to learn and practice. ""I have been a regional trainer for the best boys in this area, and I checked how much they trained with the team and by themselves,"" says Hans Erik. ""Martin is training more than double than these boys did -- at least 20 hours a week."" It's not just how much he trains -- it's also the type of training he has focused on by doing everything with the ball. ""The boys loved it when I joked about other teams that warmed up with running instead of using the ball,"" adds Hans Erik. ""I always said that they should maybe do athletics."" Hans Erik believes Martin has been able to cope with the demands of professional football and making his international debut at such an early age because of the work done to develop his first touch and ""quick feet."" ""It's the pace of the game that makes the difference in adjusting to different levels,"" says Hans Erik. ""We've used so many hours in working with his first and second touch to take off the pressure. ""We have worked a lot on bringing the ball closely to his feet, so he can change direction quickly, so even if he's physically weaker than the others he doesn't get caught because he's able to get away."" Family fortunes . Now 40, Hans Erik admits that, as a player, he was ""a runner with a big heart and scored some goals"" -- so does Martin's talent come from his mother Lene? ""She played handball and sprinted,"" says Hans Erik, before joking: ""She tells us she was fantastic, but none of us, or any others, has seen that."" While Hans Erik's professional career has given him advantages in overseeing Martin's progression as a player, he admits it has given him difficulties as a father in his relationship with his son. ""I was always afraid of favoring him. We were always changing captain, but he was never picked,"" he says. ""The expectations were high on him so it happened that I sometimes yelled at him and one day another parent came to me and said that I was too hard with Martin. ""Then Martin and I agreed that he should always get the feedback when we were alone in the car after the game. That was a good solution. ""We've always -- and still do -- talked so much about football. His natural understanding for the game makes him a very smart player. Since he was 10 I could discuss football with him as an adult."" Stay or go? Hans Erik, who has so far avoided using agents to advise on his son's career, concedes that ""the level of the Norwegian league isn't as strong as many other European leagues."" So what's next for the wunderkind from the port city of Drammen who has already visited Manchester United as well as German clubs Bayern Munich, Stuttgart and Borussia Dortmund? Karlsen believes going to a country like the Netherlands would benefit the 15-year-old. ""If he went to some other countries they might take something out of his game, by telling him to get rid of the ball,"" Karlsen says. ""In Holland, they are not so concerned with the results."" Whatever Odegaard does next, his father insists the decision will not be influenced by money. ""In the end it's all about development,"" he says. ""Nothing else matters. I'm allergic to boys who are satisfied getting into an academy or winning a first-team contract, because you haven't achieved nothing . ""It's a danger when there's so much attention to him from clubs and the media. I think he has handled it very well so far and he has his feet on the ground. ""When we are talking with the clubs we have just talked about sport. We're also in a position that it's not obvious that he will go abroad now."" And amid all the hype and record breaking, Odegaard's father insists that his son's education will not be forgotten. ""He will still, of course, go to school. I don't think it's good for any young boy just to play football and PlayStation. You need to work with your brain too and to develop as a person.""","Martin Odegaard became Norway's youngest international in August .

"(CNN) -- One day before U.S. President Barack Obama's Canadian visit last week, Canadian fighter jets intercepted two Russian bombers near Canadian air space, the defense minister said Friday. Canadian jets intercepted Russian TU-95 Bear bomber aircraft last week similar to this one. ""At no time did Russian planes enter Canadian air space, but within 24 hours of the president's visit here ... we did scramble F-18 fighter planes from NORAD in Canada command,"" Peter MacKay said in a news conference in Ottawa. The Russian planes were in international waters, about 118 miles (190 kilometers) northeast of Tuktoyuktuk, in Canada's Northwest Territories. ""It was a routine flight over international airspace,"" Yevgeniy Khorishko, a spokesman at the Russian Embassy in Washington, told CBC news. NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, is a joint U.S.-Canadian agency in charge of aerospace control for the North American continent. ""As has been done on previous occasions, (Canadian pilots) sent very clear signals that are understood, that (the) aircraft was to turn around, turn tail and head back to its own air space, which it did,"" MacKay said. The Russian planes were identified as TU-95 Bear aircraft by NORAD spokesman Michael Kucharek.","Russian bombers were in international waters when Canadian jets intercepted them .

"Kennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) -- The space shuttle Endeavour landed at Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Wednesday, completing its 25th and final mission -- the next-to-last mission for NASA's 30-year-old space shuttle program. ""Welcome home, Endeavour,"" Mission Control in Houston said. The spacecraft touched down at 2:34 a.m. ET at the end of a nearly 16-day mission to the International Space station. ""It's sad to see her land for the last time, but she really has a great legacy,"" said shuttle commander Mark Kelly after Endeavour rolled to a stop in the darkness of a warm Florida morning . The youngest of the shuttles retires after 25 space flights. During 299 days in space, Endeavour orbited the earth 4,671 times and logged almost 122.9 million miles, NASA said. It first went into service in 1993. Endeavour unlocked from the International Space Station late Sunday after spending more than 11 days linked to the orbiting laboratory, where the astronauts installed a cosmic ray detector. The $2 billion, 15,000-pound machine is already at work ""gathering information that could improve our understanding of the universe,"" Kelly said. ""The retirement of Endeavour and the shuttle fleet will not end the human need to explore,"" Kelly said in comments from space that were posted on NASA's website. ""It is and always will be part of who we are. The United States will build other spaceships better than those of today. Even if they are years in the future, they will nevertheless increase our knowledge of the world, generate an enormous benefit to the economy and inspire our children."" On July 8, space shuttle Atlantis is to make NASA's final shuttle flight. Thousands of people turned out Tuesday night at Kennedy Space Center to watch it make the three-mile trip from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad. ""Look how majestic it looks rolling out to the launch pad,"" said astronaut Sandy Magnus to reporters.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. military personnel fear that seeking help for mental health problems could harm their careers, according to a survey released Wednesday. An Iraq war veteran takes one of the four medications he is prescribed for post-traumatic stress disorder. Three of five members of the military worry that it would have at least some impact, according to the small online survey conducted for the American Psychiatric Association. About half said they thought other people would think less of them if they sought help for mental health problems. The report was released a day before a scheduled announcement by Defense Secretary Robert Gates aimed at encouraging more service members to seek help for post-combat stress. Pentagon officials said troops who file for security clearances will no longer have to answer a question on the standard application about whether they have been treated for combat-related mental health issues. Currently, if service members say they have received treatment, they must answer the question in an in-depth interview with a security agent. Dr. Carolyn Robinowitz, president of the APA, called the figures in the survey ""alarming"" and urged Congress to devote more money to treating mental health problems arising from service in combat zones. One in four of the troops surveyed said he or she knew ""nothing at all about effective mental health treatments for issues that may arise from their service in a war zone,"" Robinowitz said. She said a military culture that emphasizes toughness could hinder efforts to get troops to seek help. ""The military has done a good job of having a lot of educational materials around,"" she said, but she is not sure the information ""filtered down"" to the people who need it. An Army psychiatrist admitted that it is a challenge to get people to seek help. ""Stigma is a problem. We recognize that,"" said Col. Elisabeth Cameron Ritchie of the Army surgeon general's office. ""Anything we can do to decrease the stigma, we want to do."" A clear majority of troops rated their own mental health as good or excellent, but many reported regularly experiencing common symptoms of mental illness, including difficulty sleeping at least twice a week and a lack of interest in daily activities at least twice a week. The findings came on the heels of a much larger study by the RAND Corp., which found that nearly one in five service members returning from Afghanistan or Iraq had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder or major depression, but only about half of them sought treatment. That study, ""Invisible Wounds of War,"" also said troops feared that seeking help could harm their careers. The APA study, the Military Mental Health Survey, polled troops' spouses as well as service personnel. One spouse, Monique Rizer, said she experienced migraines and numbness in her face after being left alone with two young children when her husband deployed to Iraq. She saw doctors even though, she said, ""I had a feeling there wasn't a neurological problem."" She began to talk with other military spouses about her problems, she said, and was surprised to find that not only were others experiencing stress, some had the same symptoms. ""I was really surprised to find out many of them were going through the same things I was going through. Nobody was really admitting it was more than we could handle,"" she said. The survey of 78 members of the military and 113 spouses was conducted online by Harris Interactive on March 5-18.

"(CNN) -- Even if you didn't watch the Golden Globes, you might have caught the highlights and low points from Twitter's armchair critics. Amid the chatter about dresses, 'dos and the long path to the stage, some viewers used Twitter to call out examples of sexism and the lack of diversity surrounding the awards. While there was much love for hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, discussion of gender inequality and racial disparities among nominees and winners coursed throughout the Twitterverse. Some of the conversation was stoked by the Representation Project, a nonprofit that challenges gender stereotypes in the media. The group urged viewers to use the hashtag #NotBuyingIt to cite examples of racism and sexism during the show and in commercials.

"During a recent visit to Guaicaipuro, a traditional market in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, a fresh meat refrigerator sat empty at a grocery.  Many consumers looking for beef, poultry or fish had to go home empty-handed. The produce section looked well stocked with plenty of fruits and vegetables.  But consumers shopping at Guaicaipuro complained that prices, even for basic products, had skyrocketed. Alba Varela, a housewife and resident of Caracas, went to the market looking for cornmeal to prepare hallacas, a traditional Venezuelan dish, especially this time of the year. ""It's fundamental, because other than pork it's the main dish for us during December,"" Varela said.  ""It seems there's a shortage."" Maria de Abreu, another Caracas resident doing her grocery shopping, complained that she couldn't find powdered milk.  ""It's regulated and you can only get a can per person.  And so what people do is that they bring along a friend and another and yet another and that's how they get enough for their family,"" de Abreu said. There's also a shortage of coffee.  As soon as new supplies arrive, shoppers say, they have to run to the store to get some because it runs out very quickly. Venezuela has the highest annual inflation in Latin America.  It soared to 27.6 percent in November.  In an effort to curb this inflation, the government set price caps on as many as 15,000 goods in late November. The price of 18 products, including toothpaste, soap and diapers, which are considered ""basic,"" was immediately frozen. Consuelo Cerrada is in charge of the government agency that advocated for consumers.  She says they're doing everything possible to improve the situation.  ""The Bolivarian government is working in coordination with all of the agencies responsible for food distribution to guarantee that there will be food available,"" Cerrada said recently in an interview for Venezuelan state television.  Bolivarian is a reference to the country's official name, The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Venezuelan authorities blame the shortages on some producers who have allegedly hoarded regulated products.  According to officials, in a raid conducted in November, they found more than 200 tons of powdered milk hidden in a warehouse. President Hugo Chavez says this is an example of what his government has to deal with and places the blame on what he calls ""speculators and hoarders."" ""We have to get to the bottom of this. This is not about half measures or quick fixes. We have to apply the Constitution to the root, the way it should be done,"" Chavez said, reacting to the case of the hidden powdered milk. Venezuela is not a poor country.  It's the thirteenth largest producer of oil in the world and an important producer of minerals.  But Jennifer McCoy, director of the Americas Program at the Carter Center in Atlanta says the country is paying for the centralization of the government and a socialist agenda pushed by President Chavez. ""His goal that he has stated is to deepen the revolution, to deepen and expand socialism and to show, I think, the country his vision of his socialist experiment,"" McCoy said. Jorge Roig, vice president of Fedecamaras, a Venezuelan association that pulls together businesses, including many producers of basic goods, blames the new government price caps and regulations for the shortages. ""People are doing panic buying.  With these price caps, people are buying more than they need because they know many factories are not going to be able to produce their products.  Production has gone down because there are price caps, production is not cost-effective and we have these conditions that discourage investment,"" Roig said. It's not just ordinary people who are worried about the situation.  Under government guidelines published last month, producers of basic products, including foreign companies, must now register with government regulators and disclose how they produce, distribute and market their products, a move that has caused great concern among domestic and international companies operating in Venezuela.","Consumers often go home empty handed because of food shortages .

"It's a heartwarming, epic journey through defining events of the late 20th century, as seen through the eyes of a dim-witted but honorable hero whose life is a testament to small-town American values. It's an overrated, manipulative tearjerker that glosses over a turbulent period of U.S. history and suggests a simpleton can become a successful businessman, husband and father merely by chance. With ""Forrest Gump,"" which hit theaters 20 years ago this weekend, there's not much middle ground. The movie won the best picture Oscar, earned $677 million around the world and is hailed by many as a modern classic, filled with homespun catchphrases like, ""My momma always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" But many critics -- and some moviegoers -- hated it. To them, ""Forrest Gump"" was a simpleminded mix of gooey sentiment and ridiculous flights of fancy. (Forrest suddenly decides to jog back and forth across the country? For three years? Seriously?) ""Robert Zemeckis' ode to 20th century America still represents one of cinema's most clearly drawn lines in the sand,"" said Entertainment Weekly a decade after the movie's release. ""One-half of folks see it as an artificial piece of pop melodrama, while everyone else raves that it's sweet as a box of chocolates."" Twenty years later, the movie remains a cultural touchstone -- and surprisingly polarizing. While some other best picture winners from the '90s (""The English Patient"") have faded from memory, it's hard to find someone even now who doesn't have an opinion about ""Forrest Gump."" ""I think the movie can be read in several different ways,"" said Sam Wineburg, a professor of history at Stanford University who has co-authored academic papers about the movie's influence. ""It can be read as a celebration of American goodness and innocence. And it can also be read as a kind of critique of American naivete and innocence."" Here's a closer look at some of the arguments around ""Forrest Gump,"" both pro and con. It's a celebration of conservative values . Forrest, as played by Tom Hanks, is the epitome of wholesome decency: a God-fearing, All-American football player and war hero who has no use for the counterculture movements of the late '60s. Despite an IQ of 75, he achieves fame and financial success. He's even from red-state Alabama! Meanwhile Forrest's childhood sweetheart, Jenny Curran, becomes a promiscuous hippie, joins the anti-war movement, hangs out with the Black Panthers, gets strung out on cocaine, ponders suicide and eventually -- if you need a spoiler alert here, we feel sorry for you -- dies of an unspecified disease. No wonder many political conservatives embraced the movie. In 2009 the National Review ranked it No. 4 on its list of the 25 best conservative films of the past 25 years. ""It seems the film promotes a very conventional conservative political position,"" said Daniel Herbert, a professor of media culture at the University of Michigan. ""While both Forrest and Jenny experience many of the most notable historical events of the era, Jenny's anti-conformist lifestyle is made to look very unappealing."" Ugh. It panders to audiences . Between Alan Silvestri's swelling score and Hanks' somber voice-overs -- especially at the deaths of three major characters -- ""Forrest Gump"" wears its emotions on the surface. For many viewers, this worked -- especially during the tear-jerking final scene at Jenny's grave -- but others complained the movie went for cheap sentiment by suggesting to moviegoers how they should feel at each moment. ""This movie is so insistently heartwarming that it chilled me to the marrow,"" wrote Anthony Lane in The New Yorker. ""There are no moral crosswinds here, not a breath of doubt or unease to ruffle the Gump image."" Some critics griped the movie had no nuance, no subtlety, no shades of gray to muddy its simplistic view of the world. ""It is incredibly manipulative ... in what I would say is the most dangerous way, which is manipulation through a sleight-of-hand superficial liberalism; it hides its political conservatism in a good-ole-boy story about a protagonist whose very heroism is totally unconscious, unaware,"" said Hunter Vaughan, a professor of film theory at the University of Oakland in Rochester, Michigan. ""It is a funny film, a sweet film, and an entertaining film,"" he added. ""But it is a deceptive film, a manipulative film, and (like most best picture winners) a conservative film."" It offers young viewers a valuable history lesson . ""Forrest Gump"" spans some 30 years and touches on many important chapters in U.S. history, including the Vietnam War, the '60s anti-war movement and the Watergate scandal. Along the way Forrest encounters a young Elvis Presley and three U.S. presidents and even appears to inspire John Lennon's ""Imagine"" when he meets the ex-Beatle on a talk show. Some teachers have shown the movie in high school classrooms as a jumping-off point for discussing the '60s and '70s. No, it airbrushes history . ""The film ... simplifies historical events that were incredibly tumultuous and complex,"" said the University of Michigan's Herbert. By presenting history through the experiences of the slow-witted Forrest, the movie ""situates history as something to be felt, emotionally, at the expense of intellectual consideration."" Wineburg, of Stanford, surveyed students about the movie and found that they remembered iconic moments, such as the scene where Forrest accidentally addresses an anti-war protest in Washington and reunites with Jenny. But the students didn't remember how Forrest got there, or understand the scene's historical undercurrent -- that disillusioned Vietnam veterans were instrumental in turning public opinion against the war. Hey, lighten up! It's just a fable . Many believe ""Forrest Gump,"" adapted liberally from Winston Groom's novel, is not meant to be taken literally. Some viewers see Forrest as a Christ-like figure, especially in the scenes when he's trotting across the country, long-haired and bearded, with a herd of followers behind him. Even its floating feather, which opens the film, can be seen as a metaphor for the randomness of fate and the direction of one's life. It was a pioneer in visual effects . ""Forrest Gump"" received kudos for its unobtrusive and Oscar-winning digital effects that made Gary Sinise's Lt. Dan look like he had no legs and turned a few thousand extras at the Lincoln Memorial into half a million war protesters. The filmmakers also inserted Hanks seamlessly into archival footage of presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon, providing some of the movie's funniest moments. OK, but it's no 'Pulp Fiction' Although ""Forrest Gump"" beat ""Pulp Fiction"" for the 1994 best picture Oscar, many film scholars rate Quentin Tarantino's film -- with its vivid antiheroes, nonlinear plot and pungent dialogue -- as the better movie. ""Pulp Fiction"" and its gallery of colorful criminals didn't stand a chance of winning top honors at the Oscars that year. But Tarantino's brash movie inspired countless imitators. If you ask a film critic to list the most influential movies of the 1990s, you probably won't hear them mention ""Forrest Gump."" Who cares? It's a classic . ""Forrest Gump"" blends drama, comedy, reality and fantasy into a genre-busting saga that almost defies description. It shouldn't work, but it does. Its scenes, and lines, are indelible to many of us: ""Run, Forrest, run!"" ""I gotta pee."" ""Stupid is as stupid does."" ""That boy sure is a runnin' fool!"" ""I'm sorry I had to fight in the middle of your Black Panther party."" ""There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp ..."" The list, and ""Forrest Gump's"" legacy, goes on and on. And that's all we have to say about that.","""Forrest Gump"" was released in the United States on July 6, 1994 .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer will not be charged in connection with the prostitution scandal that prompted his resignation, the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York said Thursday. Eliot Spitzer resigned his post as New York governor in March. ""After a thorough investigation, this office has uncovered no evidence of misuse of public or campaign funds,"" U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said in a statement. The attorney's office also said it found no illicit activity related to Spitzer's withdrawal of funds for, and his payments to, the Emperors Club VIP,  which authorities have said was a prostitution ring. ""In light of the policy of the Department of Justice with respect to prostitution offenses and the longstanding practice of this office, as well as Mr. Spitzer's acceptance of responsibility for his conduct, we have concluded that the public interest would not be further advanced by filing criminal charges in this matter,"" Garcia said. Spitzer resigned in March after it was revealed that he was among the Emperors Club's patrons -- ""Client 9,"" according to court papers detailing the service's workings. Court documents detailed arrangements for a nearly two-and-a-half hour rendezvous between Client 9 and a high-class prostitute -- identified as ""Kristen"" -- at the Mayflower hotel in Washington in February. Spitzer was linked to the Emperors Club when when IRS and FBI officials noticed suspicious transfers of larger sums of money between several of the governor's personal accounts, sources told CNN. Those sources say red flags were raised when the money ended up in the bank accounts of shell companies linked to the Emperors Club. In June, the leader of the Emperors Club, Mark Brener, pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in federal court. Prosecutors said Brener's service charged between $1,000 and $5,500 an hour for trysts in New York; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; London, England; and Paris, France. Police seized more than $1 million in cash from Brener's apartment at the time of his arrest.","No evidence that Eliot Spitzer misused public or campaign funds, U.S. attorney says .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was convicted Monday on 17 of the 20 public corruption charges against him related to his attempt to sell the U.S. Senate seat held by Barack Obama before he resigned to become president. The 11 women and one man reached the verdicts on their 10th day of deliberation in the trial, which began April 20. As the verdicts were read, Blagojevich turned to look back at his wife, Patti, who dropped into her seat. None of the jurors would look at the defendant as the verdicts were being read. He was found guilty of all 10 counts involving wire fraud -- each of which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The other 10 involved extortion and bribery. Most of the counts have a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The jury acquitted Blagojevich on one count of bribery and was unable to reach verdicts on two counts of attempted extortion. ""I frankly am stunned,"" an uncharacteristically muted Blagojevich told reporters as he left the courtroom hand-in-hand with his wife. ""There's not much left to say, other than we want to get home to our little girls and talk to them and explain things to them and then try to sort things out. I'm sure we'll be seeing you guys again."" A few minutes later, as he and his wife emerged from an SUV on the street outside his house, he shook hands with a group of well-wishers, some of whom applauded him. ""It's very meaningful to feel the support of the people,"" he told a throng of reporters. ""It's a very meaningful thing. That sadness that I feel and the disappointment and the shock, Patti and I have to discuss this with our children, our little girls, and start planning for the future."" Their daughters are ages 11 and 14. Chicago-Kent College of Law Professor Richard Kling predicted that Blagojevich would wind up being sentenced to anywhere between six and 11 years. That calculation is reached by a mathematical formula, he said. ""You punch in who he is, what he did,"" he said. After delivering their verdict, the jurors addressed the news media. ""We felt it was very clear he was trying to make a trade for the Senate seat,"" one juror said. Another juror said, ""We'd tried everything to find him not guilty, but the evidence was there."" The forewoman, a retired director of music and liturgy at a church, said the experience left her with a negative view of politics in general. ""I told my husband that if he was running for politics he'd probably have to find a new wife,"" she said. Blagojevich becomes the second consecutive Illinois governor convicted of corruption. Former Gov. George Ryan is serving time in federal prison. ""We hope that next time anyone who hears any inkling of such activity would come forward to tell us,"" U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald told reporters. ""People should be offended by being shaken down and should come forward and report it to us."" The current governor, Pat Quinn, called for an ethics initiative in the state. ""Today's conviction only strengthens my resolve to push this effort forward,"" he told reporters. ""I'm very sorry that happened to their family but you have to be accountable for your deeds. Unfortunately, former Gov. Blagojevich committed crimes, according to a jury."" Last August, after a two-month trial and 14 days of deliberation, another jury deadlocked on 23 of the 24 charges Blagojevich then faced. They found him guilty on one count of lying to FBI investigators, a conviction that could carry a prison sentence of five years. The accusation that Blagojevich tried to profit as he considered whom to appoint to succeed Obama, among other allegations, prompted his impeachment by Illinois' House of Representatives and his removal from office by the state Senate in 2009. Blagojevich was taken into federal custody in December 2008, less than two years into his second term as governor. A federal grand jury indicted in him April 2009. At the time of his arrest, prosecutors said court-authorized wiretaps caught Blagojevich offering Obama's Senate seat in exchange for personal gain, including a job with a nonprofit or union organization, corporate board posts for his wife, campaign contributions or a post in Obama's administration. He expressed frustration, according to prosecutors, that Obama transition officials were ""not willing to give me anything except appreciation."" ""I've got this thing and it's (expletive) golden, and, uh, uh, I'm just not giving it up for (expletive) nothing. I'm not gonna do it,"" prosecutors quoted Blagojevich as saying. Blagojevich also considered appointing himself to the post, mulling whether he might be better off being indicted as a senator rather than governor, and saying contacts he would make in the federal job would benefit him later, according to prosecutors. Aside from the charges of trying to sell the Senate seat, prosecutors also accused Blagojevich of using his position to obtain financial benefits for himself, his family and his campaign in exchange for jobs, contracts and appointments to state boards to supporters. They accused Blagojevich of accelerating the scheme in 2008 to accumulate funds before a new state ethics law would have limited his ability to raise money from people and companies that were doing business with the state. Along with Blagojevich, prosecutors initially also charged his brother, Robert Blagojevich, with one count of wire fraud, one count of extortion conspiracy, one count of attempted extortion and one count of bribery conspiracy in connection with his brother's alleged Senate-seat-selling plan. But a week after jurors came back from the first trial deadlocked on most of the counts against Rod Blagojevich and all the charges against his brother, prosecutors dropped charges against Robert Blagojevich. Blagojevich's defense argued that he just liked to talk and that he ended up with nothing. The former Cook County, Illinois, assistant prosecutor, state representative and Golden Gloves boxer had remained in the public eye since his removal from office, appearing in a Chicago comedy show, releasing an autobiography, and competing on the TV show ""Celebrity Apprentice.""","""We felt it was very clear he was trying to make a trade for the Senate seat,"" says Juror 140 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Frank Buckles, the last living U.S. World War I veteran, has died, a spokesman for his family said Sunday. He was 110. Lawmakers Monday began to move ahead with proposed resolutions that would allow his casket to be displayed at the Capitol Rotunda, and plans were already in the works for his burial at Arlington National Cemetery. Buckles ""died peacefully in his home of natural causes"" early Sunday morning, the family said in a statement sent to CNN late Sunday by spokesman David DeJonge. Buckles marked his 110th birthday on February 1, but his family had earlier told CNN he had slowed considerably since last fall, according his daughter Susannah Buckles Flanagan, who lives at the family home near Charles Town, West Virginia. Buckles, who served as a U.S. Army ambulance driver in Europe during what was then known as the ""Great War,"" rose to the rank of corporal before the war ended. His assignments included that of an escort for German prisoners of war. Little did he know he would someday become a prisoner of war during World War II. He came to prominence in recent years, in part because of the work of DeJonge, a Michigan portrait photographer who had undertaken a project to document the last surviving veterans of that war. As the years continued, all but Buckles had passed away, leaving him the ""last man standing"" among U.S. troops who were called ""The Doughboys."" His death leaves only two verified surviving WWI veterans in the world, both of whom are British. President Obama issued a statement Monday on Buckles' passing, saying he and first lady Michelle Obama were ""inspired"" by Buckles' story. Frank Buckles lived the American Century,"" Obama's statement said. ""Like so many veterans, he returned home, continued his education, began a career, and along with his late wife Audrey, raised their daughter Susannah. ... We join Susannah and all those who knew and loved her father in celebrating a remarkable life that reminds us of the true meaning of patriotism and our obligations to each other as Americans."" Buckles told CNN in 2007 he accepted the responsibility of honoring those who had gone before him, and to be their voice for permanent, national recognition after he was gone. DeJonge found himself the spokesman and advocate for Buckles in his mission to see to it that his comrades were honored with a monument on the National Mall, pushing for improvements to a neglected, obscure city memorial nearly in the shadow of the elaborate World War II memorial. Buckles wanted national status granted to the D.C. War Memorial, a marble gazebo built in the 1930s that, for now, honors only his comrades from the District of Columbia. His call was to elevate the designation of the site to join U.S. honors accorded to those who served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. ""We have come to the end of a chapter in history,"" said Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, a House sponsor of legislation to upgrade the DC War Memorial. ""Frank was the last American Doughboy -- a national treasure,"" Poe said in a statement provided to CNN. The ""Frank Buckles WWI Memorial Act"" passed the House but had not cleared the Senate before Congress adjourned. Poe on Monday restated his support for a House resolution that would allow a public display for Buckles in the Capitol Rotunda. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia is a co-sponsor of the Senate proposal. Buckles, at the age of 108, came to Capitol Hill from West Virginia in 2009 to testify before a Senate panel on behalf of the D.C. War Memorial bill. He sat alongside Rockefeller and fellow proponent Sens. John Thune, R-South Dakota, and Jim Webb, D-Virginia. ""I have to,"" he told CNN when he came to Washington, as part of what he considered his responsibility to honor the memory of fellow veterans. Rockefeller praised Buckles in a statement Monday, calling him ""a unique American, a wonderfully plain-spoken man, and an icon for the World War I generation."" ""His life was full and varied and an inspiration for his unbridled patriotism and enthusiam for life,"" the statement said. Buckles, after World War I ended, took up a career as a ship's officer on merchant vessels. He was captured by the Japanese in the Philippines during World War II and held prisoner of war for more than three years before he was freed by U.S. troops. Never saying much about his POW experience, Buckles instead wanted attention drawn to the plight of the D.C. War Memorial. During a visit to the run-down, neglected site a few years ago, he went past the nearby World War II memorial without stopping, even as younger veterans stopped and saluted the old soldier in his wheelchair as he went by. Renovations to the structure began last fall, but Buckles, with his health already failing, could not make a trip to Washington to review the improvements. The National Park Service is overseeing efforts that include replacing a neglected walkway and dressing up a deteriorated dome and marble columns. Details for services and arrangements will be announced in the days ahead, the family statement said. Flanagan, his daughter, said preliminary plans began weeks ago, with the Military District of Washington expressing its support for an honors burial at Arlington, including an escort platoon, a horse-drawn casket arrival, a band and a firing party. ""It has long been my father's wish to be buried in Arlington, in the same cemetery that holds his beloved General (John) Pershing,"" Flanagan wrote as she began to prepare for the inevitable in a letter she sent to home-state U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia. ""I feel confident that the right thing will come to pass,"" she said. Manchin issued a statement Monday that read, in part, ""He lived a long and rich life as a true American patriot, and I hope that his family's loss is lightened with the knowledge that he was loved and will be missed by so many."" Buckles in 2008 attended Veterans Day ceremonies at the grave of Pershing, the commander of U.S. troops during World War I. He also met with then-President George W. Bush at the White House, and U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates at the Pentagon. ""The First World War is not well understood or remembered in the United States,"" Gates said at the time. ""There is no big memorial on the National Mall. Hollywood has not turned its gaze in this direction for decades. Yet few events have so markedly shaped the world we live in."" Buckles' family asks that donations be made to the National World War I Legacy Project to honor Frank Buckles and the 4,734,991 Americans with whom he served. More than 116,000 Americans were killed, and more than 204,000 wounded, in the 19 months of U.S. involvement in the war, according to the Congressional Research Service. The overall death toll of the 1914-18 conflict was more than 16.5 million, including nearly 7 million civilians, and more than 20 million wounded.

"If you are traveling today, you may want to check with your airline. Thousands of flights into and out of Chicago's two airports have been delayed or canceled since a fire damaged a key Chicago air traffic control center Friday, creating flight problems that rippled across the nation. Aviation authorities say it will take at least two weeks to get the center back to normal. One airport affected, O'Hare International, is the world's second-busiest airport. Long lines of stranded passengers have been clogging Chicago airports all weekend. O'Hare was operating at 60% of its capacity Monday, according to the Chicago Department of Aviation, while Midway International Airport was at 75%. As of Monday morning, at least 300 flights had been canceled at O'Hare. The FAA hopes to have the center in Aurora, Illinois, repaired and returned to full service by October 13, the agency said Sunday. Other control centers have handled many of the Chicago flights while repairs are made. Police say Friday's blaze was set intentionally by Brian Howard, a contract employee at the facility, before he apparently attempted to kill himself. According to an affidavit, first responders found smoke when they arrived in the basement of the control center after a 911 call about 5:40 a.m. Friday. They also found blood on the floor. They followed the trail and found two knives and a lighter and then Howard himself, who was in the process of cutting his throat, according to the affidavit. The paramedics took a knife from him and began to treat Howard, who told them to leave him alone. Howard was taken to a hospital in Aurora. Howard remained hospitalized Monday, according to Randall Samborn, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago. He's charged with one count of destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities, a felony that could bring a 20-year prison sentence. No court date has been set. Howard, 36, had worked at the center for eight years but was facing a transfer to Hawaii, according to an affidavit filed in U.S. district court in Illinois, obtained by CNN affiliate WLS. The affidavit quoted a Facebook post's of Howard's: ""Take a hard look at the mirror, I have. And this is why I am about to take out... and my life... I am sorry. Leaving you with a big mess. Do your best to move on quickly from me please. Feel like I give a shit for the first time in a long time again... but not for too long (haha!) So I'm gonna smoke this blunt and move on, take care everyone."" The FAA will launch an internal review of security protocols at its facilities, its administrator said Monday. ""If we need to make changes as a result of what happened on Friday to improve the system, we will not hesitate to do so,"" Michael Huerta said. ""We need to be looking at everything ... from the people that we employ through our contractors, all the way through all the processes that we use -- how they have access to our facilities and what kind of monitoring takes place within those facilities. That's all on the table,"" he said. Huerta told CNN that background checks on Howard had not identified any potential problems, and so he wants investigators to look into that vetting process too. ""Are there things that we need to do differently? Immediately, it's more eyes, more resources, and more frequent check-ins with facilities, but over the long term, if there are things that we identify that we should change, we're certainly going to change them,"" the administrator said. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois is calling for an investigation into whether security was breached. The suspect was able to enter the facility with a black suitcase without raising any red flags, officials have said. CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said the FAA has to take a second look at who has access to critical facilities. ""You have to make sure you have a system in place to evaluate your contract employees, because remember, the Federal Aviation Administration ... huge percent of their employees are contract employees,"" she said. Most of the air traffic controllers are FAA employees, she added. After the fire, air traffic controllers initially had to transfer flight data manually rather than by computer, said Doug Church, spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. Church said the fire damaged the telecom line that transfers flight plans from the airlines to the O'Hare control tower and then to the Aurora control center. Airlines had to fax flight plans to the control tower, he said. Because so much information had to be manually transferred, two controllers were needed for each position. The effects of the fire were immediate. O'Hare International is a hub for United Airlines and other major carriers. When controllers stop flights scheduled to land or depart from there, it has the potential to trigger a line of falling air-traffic dominoes that will ruin travel plans for countless would-be passengers. The FAA says it's bringing in extra technicians to replace the damaged communications network in the building, officially called the Chicago En Route Center. ""Teams will be working around the clock to install equipment, run cable and restore network connections at the facility,"" the FAA said. The FAA said over the weekend that it was managing the air traffic into and out of Chicago ""through other large Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin with additional help from high-altitude centers in Minnesota, Kansas, Indiana and Ohio.""","FAA administrator: ""We need to be looking at everything""

"FAIRBANKS, Alaska (CNN) -- Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin gave her final speech as Alaska's governor Sunday before stepping down from her post, telling a Fairbanks crowd that she is resigning ""to chart a new course to advance the state."" Sarah Palin told a crowd in Fairbanks that she accomplished what she had promised as governor. ""Now people who know me, they know how much I love this state ... I feel it is my duty to avoid the unproductive, typical, politics-as-usual, lame-duck session in one's last year in office,"" Palin said, just moments before Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell was sworn in as governor. ""With this decision, now I will be able to fight even harder for you, for what is right and for the truth,"" Palin continued. ""And I have never felt you need a title to do that."" Palin -- interrupted briefly by a heckler -- devoted much of her last address to a rundown of her accomplishments as governor, including winning legislative approval for a massive natural gas pipeline and governing ""with fiscal restraint."" ""What I promised, we accomplished,"" she told the mostly supportive crowd. Palin has been a polarizing figure in the Republican Party since August, when then-presidential candidate John McCain made her his pick for vice president. At the time, little was known about the first-term governor. Within days, Palin's face and strong personality was splashed across newspapers, magazines and tabloids. The 45-year-old mother of five startled the political world earlier this month with her announcement that she was resigning as Alaska's governor. The decision to step down a year and a half before her term ends and her often-disjointed July 3 resignation speech fueled days of debate among political analysts. She has attributed the decision to tremendous pressure, time and the financial burden of a litany of ethics complaints in the past several months. The complaints were without merit and took away from the job she wanted to do for Alaskans, Palin has said. On Sunday, Palin recalled promising ethics reform as a gubernatorial candidate, saying, ""We promised it, and now it is the law."" ""Ironically, it needs additional reform to stop blatant abuse from partisan operatives,"" she added. ""I hope the lawmakers will continue that reform."" A nationwide poll released Friday indicates that a majority of Americans have an unfavorable view of the outgoing governor. But the ABC News/Washington Post survey also suggested that seven out of 10 Republican voters maintain a positive opinion of Palin. Fifty-three percent of those questioned in the poll view Palin negatively, with four in 10 holding a positive view of her. The survey suggests that among those respondents, there is doubt about Palin's leadership skills and her understanding of intricate issues. Fifty-seven percent said they don't think Palin understands complex issues, and 54 percent do not feel she is a strong leader. Palin opened her Sunday speech with what she called ""some straight talk,"" taking on the media and then Hollywood. ""You represent what could and should be a respected, honest profession, and what could and should be a cornerstone of our democracy -- and that's why our troops are willing to die for you,"" she said. ""So how about in honor of the American solider you quit making things up?"" she added, without elaborating. She also warned against ""anti-hunting, anti-Second Amendment circuses from Hollywood"" that use ""delicate, tiny celebrity starlets"" to push their cause. ""Hollywood needs to know -- we eat, therefore, we hunt,"" Palin told a cheering crowd.","Palin transfers power to Alaska's lieutenant governor .

"We were not the first round of protesters this prison cell had seen. On the beige walls, former residents had scratched ""OWS,"" ""love"" and an expletive about the police. At 1 Police Plaza in New York City, our cell was 5-by-7, freezing cold, with a padded bench just long enough for three of us to sit on. A fourth woman was curled on the floor. In the corner, there was a non-functioning sink and a toilet. When one woman needed to use it, we formed a line to block her from the male officers. In the 10 hours I was held, there was one meal: Four slices of bread in soggy Saran wrap, a packet of mayo and a mini carton of milk. Last year, Occupy Wall Street happened outside of my window. As a local, I was supposed to deplore those ""dirty hippies."" But I found I couldn't. See Crabapple's art in CNN's digital gallery . At the time, I made my living drawing for ferociously swanky nightclubs while watching the world crumble and people from Tahrir Square to London take to the streets. Everyone said that Americans were too apathetic for that sort of thing. Occupy Wall Street proved them wrong. While I was initially skeptical, Occupy soon won me over.  Across the street, Zucotti Park had transformed into a mini-city where anyone could get a book, a meal and basic medical care for free. I was inspired by seeing Americans, of all backgrounds and beliefs, caring passionately about income inequality and financial corruption. I wanted to help however I could. I turned my apartment into a press room, offering coffee and Wi-Fi for journalists filing copy about the young movement. I donated money and marched in protests.  While I have been political before, I never let it seep into my artwork. Now I created posters, some of which ended up on the streets as protest signs hours after I uploaded them to the Internet. These posters remain some of the work of which I am most proud. But that was 2011. This is 2012. On the morning of my arrest, I wasn't sure whether the Occupy Wall Street movement was over. I went to the demonstration out of loyalty and nostalgia for the days of the Zucotti camps. The people's library, free clothes and gourmet soup kitchen were gone now, or reduced to shadows of their former selves. But I wanted to pay homage to the movement that had brought out more of my artistic voice. At seven in the morning I was on the sidewalk outside my apartment, tweeting pictures of the marchers and police. The NYPD had turned lower Manhattan into a mess of checkpoints. In that way, they were ridiculously effective at disrupting traffic. There were hundreds of cops -- some in riot gear, some on horseback. There were trucks piled high with metal barricades. We just walked. Some were on the street, most like me cautiously stayed on the sidewalk. We shouted the shopworn protest chants that feel so meaningful when you're chanting them. At one corner, I saw a cop grabbing the arm of a woman in front of me and pulling her into the street. It was the same gesture you might use to escort an old lady, and, when the next officer did this to me, that is what I thought it was. But then, halfway across the street, he cuffed my hands behind my back. There was no warning. No Miranda rights like in the movies. At first, I was incredulous. It was not until I got my desk ticket that night for blocking traffic that I had any idea what the officer was accusing me of doing. I was a head shorter than the officer. I said to him, ""You know I was on the sidewalk."" He wouldn't meet my eyes. I was two blocks from my apartment. But because I was part of a protest, I was no longer a local. I was an obstruction to be cleared. Going into the police van, they snapped my picture on a Fujimax Polaroid knockoff, hipster party style. I gave them my best grin. A man in a suit passed by, looked us over, and said to the police, ""nice work."" In the van, there were eight people, including an elderly nurse and a legal observer in his official green cap. We had all been plucked off the sidewalk. The van door shut. I edged my cell phone out of my purse, texted friends about my arrest and then, bored, began dissecting the situation on Twitter. I regretted being such a random little duck, pointlessly arrested to stop the protests. In the police yard, we traded our bags for vouchers. We waited to have our pockets searched while our shoulders ached from an hour in zip-cuffs. The woman in front of me had wrist injuries. The searching officer yelled that her wrist braces were weapons and threatened to send her through central booking -- ""the tombs"" -- where everything took twice as long and was covered in filth. Jail is waiting. Depressing waiting. Humiliating waiting. Pointless, tedious waiting in a crowded cage with dead roaches and no running water, where officers processing you through the system laugh at your discomfort and fear. The women sang songs to pass the time. ""Solidarity Forever."" ""The Sun Will Come Up Tomorrow."" The booking officer screamed she'd send us all to the tombs if we didn't shut up. We sang anyway. Time seemed interminable. Soon you find yourself banging on cell bars in unison, amplifying the voice of protesters who needed medicine, or who didn't get their phone calls for eight hours. When the male prisoners burst into cheers, we shushed each other and grinned. I was the last person released from my cell. The woman who left before me, a middle-aged lawyer who had been arrested multiple times that weekend, reassured me that I'd get out soon. When I did, friends were waiting with hugs, pizza and the National Lawyers Guild. Occupiers have a strong support system for those who are arrested, whether it's in the form of food, drinks or a pro bono lawyer. I felt incredibly lucky, essentially a tourist in that miserable place. In the pizza joint across the street, we bought beer for a woman who'd been held for 38 hours. While I was alone before my release, pacing back and forth, it was almost impossible not to suspect that I was stupid, that my actions were futile. Which is the point of an arrest. Getting arrested for a social protest is like being put through aversion therapy, a punishment in and of itself.  A relative of mine, an Occupy supporter, said that after my arrest, she'd never protest again. And that's the point. Me? I'd be back. Occupy Wall Street taught many middle-class white people what poor people and people of color had already known. The law is often a hostile and arbitrary thing. Speak too loudly, stand in the wrong place, and you're on the wrong side of it. My experience was infinitely easier than most. Many people arrested came out to a lost job, or they have to deal with nerve-damaged hands from being in cuffs for too long, or they face a society that believes they asked for it. While we were in the cell, after we banged too long and chanted too hard, an officer stared at us. ""Look at you people,"" she said. ""What do you hope to accomplish? You brought this on yourselves.""","Molly Crabapple: I was arrested for taking part in an Occupy Wall Street rally .

"Jonesboro, Arkansas (CNN) -- Three men who served 18 years in prison following their convictions in a 1993 triple-slaying in West Memphis, Arkansas, walked free Friday to cheers from a supportive crowd after entering new pleas in the case. ""I want to be out. I deserve to be out,"" said Jason Baldwin, who along with Damien Echols and Jessie Misskelley Jr., was freed after entering rarely used pleas in which they maintained their innocence but acknowledged that prosecutors have evidence to convict them. Echols and Baldwin entered what is known as an Alford plea on three counts of first degree murder. Misskelley entered similar pleas to one count of first degree murder and two counts of second degree murder. Craighead County Circuit Judge David Laser sentenced the three to the 18 years already served and imposed a 10-year suspended sentence -- meaning they could be returned to jail if they violate the law. ""I don't think that it will make the pain go away to the victim families. I don't think it will make the pain go away to the defendant families,"" Laser said, adding it was nevertheless the best for all involved. Echols was previously sentenced to death and Misskelley and Baldwin were given life sentences in the May 1993 slayings of second-graders Steven Branch, Christopher Byers and Michael Moore. The boys' bodies were mutilated and left in a ditch, hogtied with their own shoelaces. Prosecutors argued that the men who were convicted, teenagers at the time, were driven by satanic ritual and that Echols had been the ringleader. Critics of the case against the men argued that no direct evidence tied the three to the murders and that a knife recovered from a lake near the home of one of the men could not have caused the boys' wounds. More recent DNA testing also demonstrated no links, according to the men's supporters. Echols said after his release that he was ""very much in shock, very overwhelmed."" ""I'm just tired,"" Echols said. ""This has been going on for over 18 years, and it's been an absolute living hell."" Baldwin said he didn't initially want to accept the deal. ""This was not justice,"" he said, adding that he dropped his opposition to pave the way for Echols' release from death row. ""He had it so much worse than I had it,"" Baldwin said of Echols. ""It's just insufferable to put a person through that."" While prosecuting attorney Scott Ellington said the pleas entered Friday validate the decision of jurors who sent the men to prison, it also spares Arkansas the possibility of a retrial, which would have been difficult to prosecute after so many years, or a potential civil lawsuit by the men. The trio had been on course to win the right to new trials later this year. ""This is an appropriate resolution to this case at this time,"" Ellington, who works in Arkansas' second judicial district, told reporters. ""Only time will tell as to whether this was a right decision on my part."" Although supporters of the men, dubbed the West Memphis 3, believe the true killer remains free, Ellington said he believes the pleas resolve the case. ""I have no reason to believe there was anyone else involved in the homicide of these three children but the three defendants who pled guilty today,"" he said. But he said the state could file charges against others if new evidence emerges implicating someone else in the case. Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel said his staff had been helping Ellington's staff prepare for a state Supreme Court hearing on the case scheduled for December. But he said he learned this week that Ellington had accepted a plea deal proposed by the defense. ""I continue to believe that these defendants are guilty of the crimes for which they have now been twice convicted,"" McDaniel said in a release. ""Prosecutors know their cases better than anyone. In this case, Mr. Ellington has exercised his discretion in such a way that has led to nine murder convictions that can never be appealed."" The case has drawn national attention, with actor Johnny Depp and singers Eddie Vedder and Natalie Maines trying to rally support for the men's release. Vedder and Maines were at the courthouse on Friday. John Mark Byers, whose stepson Christopher Byers was one of the three victims, said he believes the three men are innocent and releasing them without exonerating them of the crime is an outrage. ""They're innocent. They did not kill my son,"" Byers said before the hearing. The father of another of the victims, Steven Branch, also blasted the decision, but for another reason. ""I don't know what kind of deal they worked up,"" Steve Branch told CNN affiliate WMC-TV before the hearing. ""Now you can get some movie stars and a little bit of money behind you, and you can walk free for killing somebody."" But Jessie Misskelley Sr. said he was happy that his son would be getting out of prison. ""I thought it might be some kind of publicity stunt. I can't believe it but it's real,"" he told WMC. The three men were seeking a retrial in the case, and a hearing had been scheduled for a new trial. The state Supreme Court ruled in November that the three could present new evidence to the trial court after DNA testing between 2005 and 2007 failed to link them to the crime. The material included hair from a ligature used to bind Moore and a hair recovered from a tree stump near where the bodies were found, Arkansas Supreme Court documents said. The hair found in the ligature was consistent with Branch's stepfather, Terry Hobbs, while the hair found on the tree stump was consistent with the DNA of a friend of Hobbs, according to the documents. Police have never considered Hobbs a suspect, and he maintains that he had nothing to do with the murders. Echols and Baldwin said in a news conference after the men were released that they would continue to work to clear their names, something Baldwin said authorities aren't trying to do. ""They're not out there trying to find out who really murdered those boys,"" he said.","NEW: Arkansas' AG backs the prosecutor, says he still believes the men are guilty .

"In one of the biggest such recalls ever, Graco has agreed to recall 3.7 million child car seats manufactured in recent years -- even as it officially contests a government request to recall nearly 1.8 million more -- over a buckling issue. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced Tuesday that Graco is voluntarily recalling 11 of 18 model seats that the government agency had asked it to recall. ""NHTSA's investigation will remain open pending its evaluation of the Graco recall and until the agency's consideration of the review of the 7 remaining sea models is completed,"" the department said. The 3.7 million seats alone makes this recall the fourth biggest ever for car seats, according to the federal agency. If all the seats the NHTSA was asking to Graco to recall are added in, it would be the biggest. In a statement, Graco said the voluntary recall affects ""harness buckles used on all toddler convertible car seats and harnessed  booster seats manufactured from 2009 to July 2013."" ""This is not a new issue for us,"" Graco spokeswoman Ashley Mowrey said, noting that all products sold since July don't have the same problem. ""We've been working to help consumers for some time now."" At issue: the red release button in the center of the harness, which the NHTSA said can become difficult to unlatch, or can become stuck. That can make it difficult or impossible to remove the child quickly in an emergency. Graco explained that it found ""that food and dried liquids can make some harness buckles progressively more difficult to open over time or become stuck in the latched position."" The children's products company added that it was offering a ""new and improved replacement harness buckle to affected customers at no cost."" People can obtain one by calling 800-345-4109 or emailing consumerservices@gracobaby.com. Until they get such a replacement, Graco believes that parents should continue using their seats for their children. ""This does not, in any way, affect the performance of the car seat or the effectiveness of the buckle to restrain a child,"" the company said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, meanwhile, said it ""encourages parents and caregivers to consider acquiring an alternative car seat for transporting children until their Graco seat is fixed."" Graco reports no injuries associated with this issue on seats, which sold for between $99 and $400. According to Graco's website, the recall models include these toddler convertible car seats:  the Cozy Cline, Comfort Sport, Classic Ride 50, My Ride 65, My Ride 65 with Safety Surround, My Ride 70, Size4Me 70, My Size 70, Head Wise 70 and Smart Seat. The harnessed booster seats that are part of the recall are the Nautilus 3-in-1, Nautilus Elite and Argos. According to the government, the seven models that Graco isn't recalling despite being asked to do so by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are all infant seats. Specifically, they are: Snugride, Snugride 30, Snugride 32, Infant Safe Seat-Step 1, Snugride 35, Tuetonia 35, and Snugride Click Connect 40. Asked about these models, Graco's spokeswoman said that any customers with those or other car seats can still call and get a new harness buckle sent to them for free. ""They are not officially recalled; however, customers experiencing any difficulty with their harness buckle can still get a new one,"" said Mowrey.","Graco is voluntarily recalling convertible, harnessed booster car seats .
But it is not recalling infant car seats, despite the government's request .

"Heaps of trash pile up for miles in Kibera, a district of Nairobi that houses nearly 1 million people and is one of the poorest slums in the world. Aluminum shanties fill the horizon, and an odor of urine cuts through the air. A man trots through the narrow, unpaved streets on a camel. If you make your way through this crowded maze, however, you will find the Kibera Girls Soccer Academy, a free public school for girls and, recently, a few boys. Peek in through the windows, and you'll see a sight that seems incongruous next to the grimy chaos outside. In this school, where there is no electricity and temperatures often top 90 degrees, dozens of students in neat wool uniforms are sliding their fingers across touch screens, reading a lesson on their Amazon Kindle e-reader. The students, who range in age from 14 to 20, are cheerful, welcoming and quick to share the genres of books they like to read in both Swahili and English. Their school is one of 28 participating in a program with Worldreader, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco that provides modern technology -- usually Kindles -- to improve literacy in the most impoverished parts of the world. By expanding access to education in areas where books are a scarce resource, the Worldreader team is trying to break the cycle of poverty, one electronic page at a time. For years, nonprofits, churches and donors have sent shipment after shipment of books to poor African villages in hopes of boosting literacy. But according to Colin McElwee, who founded Worldreader in 2010 with David Risher, there's a better way. ""Donating paper books to a place like Africa is well-intentioned, but it's actually ill-informed,"" McElwee said. ""You can't actually get the right books to the people you want to get to, at the time they need it. It's very expensive and highly inefficient."" Carrying heavy loads of books is not practical for Kenyan students who often have to walk miles to and from school. E-readers, however, are a different story. They're lightweight and portable and give students access to entire libraries, including books from African publishers. To date, nearly 4,000 students in nine sub-Saharan African countries have read more than 1.7 million e-books through Worldreader. The e-readers give students access to a much greater variety of titles than they had access to without the devices. Although many students had never used a computer before, they quickly learned how. A pilot program several years ago in Ghana found that the Worldreader program boosted reading test scores for primary students by up to 7.6%, although benefits for older students were less clear. In the beginning, Worldreader founders admit that they worried about theft. The students, after all, go home to a community filled with poverty. To their surprise, fewer than 1% of the e-readers have gone missing. ""Books and education are really the way out of this, and people take great care of books and education,"" McElwee said. Opening doors . Doris Achola, an 18-year-old student who graduated from the academy last year and is now preparing for college, says the e-books she's read have been an inspiration. ""I read many stories (about people) who have been through many challenges,"" she said. Achola says she has a new outlook on life after reading about people like herself who have overcome poverty to become successful. It's a different way of life than what she sees in her neighborhood, where girls are often forced to marry young and education is considered a privilege. Current student Veronica Adhiambo, 8, says she loves her Kindle because it's so light compared with the heavy books she used to carry to and from school. When she gets home, she often shares the device with her friends and family so they too can read. Veronica says she wants to become a teacher. She knows that reading as many books as she can will help her pass the exams and follow her dreams. In other words, the Kindle may be her key to a better life. Abdul Kassim, executive director of the Kibera Girls Soccer Academy, started the school to address gender inequality in the community by offering a free education to girls. He says there's a long waiting list to get in because in Kenya, education and textbooks are very expensive. Kassim believes that the e-readers are the best thing that has ever happened to his school and his students' educations. ""That's why the Kindle is very important,"" he said. ""It means their life."" Kassim says he's seen dramatic improvements in reading ability and comprehension among his students with Kindles. His wish is for every student and every teacher to one day have an e-reader. In a country where leaders are pushing for more technology for students (in 2013, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to provide free laptops to all schoolchildren), a Kindle may be a more practical solution. The device can hold a charge for two weeks when Wi-Fi is turned off, which is a boon in areas where electricity is scarce. Worldreader relies on donations and gets its Kindles at cost. Through a discounted deal with shipping company DHL, the e-readers arrive in Africa loaded with books and fully charged. Most schools in the program have a room with outlets in case power runs low. Worldreader tailors the contents of each e-reader to the needs of specific schools and classes. McElwee says he's in constant communication with the schools, collecting and tracking data to learn what works and what doesn't. As McElwee sees it, it's not enough to just provide books; they must provide books that students want to read. Future success . Risher, Worldreader's president, says that continued involvement in schools is vital to the future success of the program. ""Nonprofits that drop technology into communities usually find that the community's habits and culture are far stronger than the technology, so after some time -- a few months, a few years -- nobody is using the technology anymore,"" he said. ""So what we do isn't just send a product to people. We're creating a system that brings publishers, e-reader manufacturers, teachers, children and communities together so that everyone can read more. We hope that not only will we improve millions of lives but also create habits and structures that endure for many years."" Students don't have to have an e-reader to benefit from Worldreader. The organization also created an app that allows students to read books on their cell phones (cell phone penetration is as high as 80% in developing countries; in Kenya, cell towers are everywhere). The app makes learning even more portable and has been downloaded more than 335,000 times. ""Many people don't think you can engage and read on such a small screen, but we have reams of data that proves this,"" McElwee said. ""People are reading for hours on end, not only starting books but completing them."" By working with African publishers, Worldreader ensures that the content students receive is culturally relevant. That makes the books easier for the kids to relate to and is a change from a time when schools had to rely on donors for reading material, no matter how far afield it was (""The History of Utah,"" for example.) Lawrence Njagi, chairman of the Kenya Publishers Association, has worked with Worldreader for the past three to four years. He believes that getting books to Kenyans as cheaply and easily as possible is one of the most important things he's achieved. ""Most of the population lives below $1 a day. Most books are $4 to $5. Suddenly, we are able to unveil thousands of books costing much lower -- maybe cents. That makes a big difference,"" he said. ""The most gratifying thing was to see a child with no shoes but reading an e-reader to other children. That, to me, was probably the best day of my life.""","A nonprofit called Worldreader brings e-readers to students in poor countries .

"""I have here in my hand a list of 205 communists ..."" The ghost of Joe McCarthy's ulcerous accusations hung over a disturbingly casual comment this past week by U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Florida. When asked by a constituent at a town hall, ""What percentage of the American legislature do you think are card-carrying Marxists?"" ""That's a fair question,"" West replied.  ""I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party that are members of the Communist Party."" Keep in mind that this is the man Sarah Palin recently recommended be Mitt Romney's vice presidential nominee. And not only did West not apologize -- or receive significant criticism from his fellow Republicans -- his revealing response was to raise funds off it. The number West picked out was apparently based on the number of congressmen affiliated with the Congressional Progressive Caucus. This is an organization of the most liberal members of Congress, but to call them communists is a slander splashed with blood. Communists, of course, murdered more than 100 million people in the past century, if you add up the rough total of butchery by Vladimir Lenin (Soviet Union), Joseph Stalin (Soviet Union), Mao Zedong (China) and Pol Pot (Cambodia). This is the reason people were understandably offended at Miami Manager Ozzie Guillen's recent comments professing admiration for Cuban Communist dictator Fidel Castro. But there were no widespread protests or requests for censure in West's case. Instead it was greeted as an almost unremarkable part of the new normal. A military man of West's rank understands the magnitude of his misstatement.  So I'm assuming that he was sincere in the accusation. To equate liberals in Congress with communists is like equating conservatives in Congress with fascists -- something only the most brain-dead Occupy protester would attempt. And just for a moment imagine if a liberal member of Congress made an equal and opposite accusation, saying that all the members of the tea party caucus were Nazis. It would be rightly greeted with wall-to-wall outrage. But the asymmetric polarization of our politics has made such accusations within the easy reach of politically successful ideologues at unguarded moments. West's comments were simply extensions of U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann's infamous statement in 2008 about how then-candidate Barack Obama -- and many Democratic members of Congress -- held ""anti-American views."" They really believe this stuff: Anyone who is not avowedly conservative is considered liberal -- and therefore anyone who is avowedly liberal is considered communist.  This is not a little insane. It is this logic also that allows conservative activists to paint Obama as socialist or communist.  Anything even slightly left of center is immediately seen as extreme.  Thereby ideas embraced by Republicans even a decade ago -- such as the individual mandate to buy health insurance -- are now seen as radical and a clear attempt to undermine the U.S. Constitution and replace freedom with socialism. This is what happens when politics starts looking like a cult with litmus tests and loyalty oaths and periodic purges of anyone who dissents.  Perspective is the first thing abandoned. And when a member of your ""team"" says something extreme, it is either ignored or excused by invoking extreme statements from the other side of the ideological gulf -- therefore the conservative response to Rush Limbaugh calling Sandra Fluke a slut was to try and make the debate about Bill Maher's past statements about Sarah Palin. An insensitive but not entirely inaccurate statement by liberal pundit Hilary Rosen is suddenly seen as serving as a surrogate for the Obama campaign despite their immediate denunciations of it.  Extending this logic, Mitt Romney will be held that responsible for anything extreme conservative talking heads say in this campaign. Fundraising off extreme statements is just the latest innovation -- something even more cynical than anything Joe McCarthy might have tried. At least for now, West is not a new McCarthy. He's not a fearful force, but a fringe voice in Congress. But the ratcheting up of rhetoric has been occurring for so long that we almost don't notice it anymore.  This feeds the cycle of incitement that is polarizing our politics.  It will only stop when members of the two parties start condemning extreme comments made by members of their own team.  And if elected officials start to equate liberals with communists, it is time to break the glass in case of emergency, because we are losing any sense of perspective in American politics.","GOP congressman falsely claimed up to 81 Democrats in House are communists .

"(CNN) -- Prince William and Kate got the royal treatment Monday. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chatted with President Obama and Hillary Clinton, received cheers from people on the street and met Jay-Z, Beyonce and King James -- also known as basketball star LeBron James. They even got a look at American-style protest as demonstrators marched outside Barclays Center in Brooklyn to show their anger about the lack of an indictment in the Eric Garner chokehold death. William and Kate arrived Sunday for a three-day trip, their first to the Big Apple. Reporting from New York, CNN royal correspondent Max Foster said Kate was the star of the show. Screams greeted the Duchess of Cambridge when she arrived at a children's craft group in Harlem, greeted by the first lady of New York City, Chirlane McCray, amid tight security. Excitement in the street . ""They were very excited even to see the motorcade, and there is a real buzz around the city today,"" Foster said. ""I think that association with Diana (Prince William's late mother), who used to come to New York a lot -- the biggest star in the world -- and Kate seems to be the closest replacement they have to Diana in this day and age."" Inside, Kate looked over some girls making crafts when an adult asked, ""Do you know who's coming to visit you today?"" ""Princess!"" the girls said. ""And you know they think you're out of 'Frozen,' "" the adult said. Kate laughed. William jetted down to Washington for a quick visit with President Obama at the White House. The two men sat in chairs and tried to chat during a photo op while a swarm of reporters and photographers crowded around them. The visit underscored ""the special relationship"" between the United States and the United Kingdom, the White House said. William addresses World Bank . William next spoke at a session of the World Bank about the need for an international effort to stop illegal wildlife trading. ""Cooperation is our greatest weapon against the poachers and traffickers who rely on evading individual national initiatives,"" he said. ""Our collective goal must be to reduce the wildlife trade by making it harder: denying traffickers access to transportation, putting up barriers to their illegal activities and holding people accountable for their actions."" William flew back to New York on a U.S. Airways shuttle, first class. One passenger tweeted a photo of the prince looking as if he were searching for a place to stash his carry-on luggage. Another passenger, CNN's Anderson Cooper, tweeted, ""Prince William just got on my DC shuttle flight"" and ""I'm hoping this means an on time departure."" It did. Monday night, William and Kate attended a reception organized by the Royal Foundation in recognition of the conservation work carried out by Tusk Trust and United for Wildlife partners, including the Wildlife Conservation Society, Conservation International and The Nature Conservancy. Hillary Clinton, the former first lady and possible presidential candidate, was there, along with daughter Chelsea. Basketball, Jay-Z and Beyonce . Finally, Kate and William made it to the Barclays Center for a game between the Brooklyn Nets and James' Cleveland Cavaliers. But before the game started, he met with NBA officials Adam Silver and Dikembe Mutombo for a photo op. At the game in Brooklyn, the couple rubbed shoulders with Beyonce -- Queen Bey to her fans -- and her husband, Jay-Z. The celebrity couple used to be part owners of the Brooklyn basketball team. The Cavaliers won the game, and afterward, James presented the couple with Cleveland Cavaliers basketball jerseys with the names ""Cambridge"" and ""George"" -- for their kid -- on the back. Kate didn't say if this was the kind of thing she'd wear around the palace. James also gave the couple cupcakes from his hometown and then appeared to joke with William about the size of their feet. He asked William what his shoe size is and the prince quipped back: ""Half the size of yours."" The princess, who is pregnant with the couple's second child, has battled acute morning sickness in recent months, and has had to cancel some events. One person had to miss the trip. The couple's chubby-cheeked toddler, Prince George, stayed home in England.

"The Orange love their red cups, according to the Princeton Review, which on Monday named Syracuse University the top party school in the nation. ""I'm excited about it,"" said Matt McGee, a junior information technology and philosophy major from Cape Cod, Massachusetts. ""I was definitely a little surprised, but it's a cool title to have."" The university administration does not share his joy. ""Syracuse University has a long-established reputation for academic excellence with programs that are nationally and internationally the best in their fields,"" the school said in a statement on its website. ""We do not aspire to be a party school."" Rounding out the top five schools were last year's winner, the University of Iowa; University of California-Santa Barbara; West Virginia University; and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. And apparently, the title means something. PJ Grund, who is set to begin his final semester at the University of Iowa this fall, told CNN that he and his fellow Hawkeyes were quite aware of being the ""No. 1 party school"" and frequently bragged about it. University of Iowa has ranked among the top five schools for four years straight. ""We took pride in it,"" he said. ""It's always nice to know that your school has a good atmosphere and you want a fun campus to be on."" ""Win or lose, Hawks still booze,"" he said, quoting a popular saying. However, Grund and other University of Iowa students stressed the title also had a negative connotation for parents, administration and people from other schools. And they said it frequently distracted from the first-class education they received in Iowa City. Liz Lindeman graduated this spring from the university with a degree in social work. ""It was the best four years of my life,"" she said. ""But when you have a reputation as a party school, you also want your school to have a good reputation for education as well."" ""I'm also going to be a professional."" McGee said he understood those concerns, as well as school officials' disappointment, and said he worried that ""partying would overshadow Syracuse's academic success."" However, this hasn't stopped some current students from being overjoyed. McGee said the only worry is that school administration will overcompensate with disciplinary action to limit student enjoyment. ""The second the news broke, everyone was pretty pumped,"" he said. ""I've never seen anything chaotic and don't really think the school needs to do more to limit partying. ... It's pretty controlled."" The title now rests in the East, but Lindeman doesn't expect Syracuse to hold onto it long. Frankly, she sees Midwestern schools as the collegiate party capital of America. ""There's something about the Midwest,"" she said. ""I guess we have nothing else to do.""","Syracuse tops Princeton Review's yearly list of the nation's top party schools .

"Phillip Steel, a resident of Deer Trail, Colorado, is ready to fight for the Old West values he feels are being threatened by drones. Asked what exactly he's proposing to do when he sees an unmanned aircraft, Steel points his weapon to the sky. ""I am proposing to shoot it down,"" he said. Deer Trail -- population 598 -- was scheduled to vote Tuesday on a measure that would allow its residents to hunt for federal drones and shoot them down, but Mayor Frank Fields said Tuesday that the vote has been postponed while a district court decides whether the ordinance is legal. The vote probably won't happen until next year, the mayor said. Steel said he wrote the ordinance after he learned the Federal Aviation Administration ""loosened regulations that would allow the flight of drones in domestic airspace."" The FAA recently announced plans to create six drone test sites around the country, none of which has been publicly listed. It plans to allow widespread use of domestic drones in 2015. U.S. launches drone from submerged submarine . ""The overall purpose of this test site program is to develop a body of data and operational experiences to inform integration and the safe operation of these aircraft in the National Airspace System,"" the agency said. Drones are cheaper to operate than helicopters. They can be used for multiple tasks, such as monitoring crops and livestock and assessing building damage. It's not drones, per se, Steel says he is against. He recognizes they can be helpful in some situations, such as a search and rescue effort, but believes they don't belong in his backyard. 15 ways drones will change your life . ""What has me fired up is it's trespassing,"" he said. ""It doesn't belong there. Yes, it's privacy. But that's only one part of it. Who's going to be flying these drones?"" The ordinance specifies the kinds of weapons and ammunition residents could use and puts a bounty on recovered parts -- $25 for the fuselage or wing, $100 for a whole drone that has U.S. government markings. The idea has found some support in Deer Trail, which takes up less than one square mile and is about 50 miles outside Aurora. ""I would shoot a drone down if it's peering in my window, scanning me, and it's within elevation where I can nail it,"" said Robert Copely, a resident. 2 injured when drone malfunctions, crashes into Navy ship .

""Shooting at an unmanned aircraft could result in criminal or civil liability, just as would firing at a manned airplane,"" it read. Steel says he won't be deterred from shooting at drones. But he hopes the ordinance, if passed, would encourage them to steer clear of his town. ""There are many things that are illegal, but the United States federal government declared war on us.

"(CNN) -- Colorado parents have a new fear to factor in this Halloween: a very adult treat ending up in their kids' candy bags. The legalization of recreational marijuana sales in the Mile High State earlier this year has led to a massive tourism boom (bringing in $19 million in tax revenue in the first half of the year) -- and the cash crop isn't just going up in smoke. Edible foods and candies infused with THC, the active ingredient in pot, have proved to be immensely popular with consumers, but they also pose a potential problem for parents trying to keep weed out of trick-or-treaters' hands. For people seeking a mellow, munchable fix, edibles may seem like an ideal solution -- until they bite off more than they bargained for. In late July, state officials enacted emergency measures to combat a rash of overdoses by inexperienced consumers, unfamiliar with the potency of pot in its edible form, and ER visits by children who had unwittingly ingested the drug at school or home. The rules as proposed (PDF) by the Colorado Department of Revenue would require products to have child-proof packaging and clearly printed health warning labels before being shipped to stores, as well as strict THC limits for various serving sizes. But those laws aren't set to go into effect until the day after the biggest candy-consuming holiday of the year: Halloween. In response, the Denver Police Department has released a YouTube video outlining some of the dangers that parents may face. In the video, Patrick Johnson, owner of Denver's Urban Dispensary, explained that rather than crafting sweets from scratch, many edibles shops buy soft or hard candy in bulk, then spray it with viscous hash oil. ""Once that candy dries, there's really no way to tell the difference between candy that's infused and candy that's not infused,"" Johnson warned. To keep under-21 ghouls from gobbling up potentially pot-laced goodies, Johnson recommends parents take a few measures: If the candy doesn't come from a recognized major brand, like Hershey's, Haribo, Mars or others, it's safest to just discard it out of the reach of children. Packages that have been tampered with in any way should also hit the trash. The Denver Police Department also addressed the issue in a recent ""Ask the Expert"" podcast, after hearing concerns from parents. Denver Police Sergeant Steve Warneke interviewed Sergeant Brett Hinkle and Detective Aaron Kafer from the DPD Marijuana Unit, who reiterated Johnson's advice to parents to seek candy in its original package. ""If you see something that doesn't look right, apples, gummy bears -- there's a ton of edible stuff that's out there on the market that's infused with marijuana that could be a big problem for your child,"" said Hinkle. Kafer advised parents taking a keen eye to their child's candy haul as they would on any previous Halloween, but with a special focus on labels that may seek to imitate classic candies. ""All marijuana edibles have to be labeled ... there will be a State of Colorado seal from the Marijuana Enforcement Division,"" Kafer said, adding that it is paramount to ""avoid and not consume anything that is out of the package."" And the nose doesn't always know, either. While marijuana has a distinctive, pungent smell, it's usually not detectable with a whiff of an edible. ""It may not smell exactly like a candy or a brownie or chocolate bar that you're used to, but you may not be able to identify it,"" said Kafer. While parental inspection has long been part of the candy-collection ritual, Hinkle noted that pot edibles' prevalence -- and potency due to the use of oil, rather than ground-up plants -- added a spooky new layer to the holiday. ""You do need to talk to your kids about it prior to this because you know how kids are -- they reach into a bag and they want to eat that piece of candy right away,"" he said.","Colorado experienced a major boom in the sales of pot edibles .

"A dispute over public prayers at town board meetings will be taken up by the Supreme Court in coming months, another contentious case over the intersection of faith and the public arena. The justices announced Monday the court will decide whether a New York community may continue what it calls ""inclusive"" prayers at its town board sessions. The petition will be argued later this year or early in 2014, with a ruling ready by the spring. After the Greece, New York, Town Board's policy was challenged because virtually all of those invited to offer prayers were Christians, the board for a time invited a few others, including a Wiccan, to offer invocations. But when that practice appeared to end, local citizens Susan Galloway and Linda Stephens sued. A federal appeals court found the board's policy to be an unconstitutional violation of the Establishment Clause, which forbids any government ""endorsement"" of religion. The town board then asked the Supreme Court to intervene. Galloway and Stephens say the board of the town outside Rochester almost always invited Christian clergy to open the meetings, usually with sectarian prayers. The plaintiffs said in court papers they were non-Christian and felt ""marginalized"" by the practice. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the Washington, D.C.-based group that is representing the two women, cited records showing that between 1999 and 2010, approximately two-thirds of the invocations contained the words ""Jesus Christ,"" Jesus,"" Holy Spirit,"" or ""Your Son."" And the lawsuit claims that  from 1999 through 2007, every meeting had a Christian-only invocation. Following the complaints from the plaintiffs, four other faiths were invited in 2008, including a Baha'i leader and a Jewish lay person. Galloway and Stephens say the Christian-only invocations resumed from January 2009 through June 2010. The plaintiffs then launched their legal fight, saying those invited to the monthly meetings were selected by a city employee from a local guide that had no non-Christian faiths listed. ""A town council meeting isn't a church service, and it shouldn't seem like one,"" said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, AUSCS executive director. ""Government can't serve everyone in the community when it endorses one faith over others. That sends the clear message that some are second-class citizens based on what they believe about religion."" While the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New York last year unanimously ruled against the city's policy, other courts around the country have found such invocations -- if inclusive and limited in scope -- to be permissible. The U.S. Congress regularly opens its sessions with a prayer. Friday's invocation by House Chaplain the Rev. Patrick Conroy began: ""Loving and gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Help us this day to draw closer to You so that, with Your Spirit and aware of Your presence among us, we may all face the tasks of this day."" Forty-nine members of Congress, mostly Republicans, along with 18 state attorneys general have filed supporting legal briefs backing the city. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a ""legal ministry"" based in Scottsdale, Arizona, filed the lawsuit on behalf of the Greece Town Board, saying the Supreme Court has upheld the practice of government bodies ""to acknowledge America's religious heritage and invoke divine guidance and blessings upon their work."" ""A few people should not be able to extinguish the traditions of our nation merely because they heard something they didn't like,"" said Brett Harvey, an attorney for the group. ""Because the authors of the Constitution invoked God's blessing on public proceedings, this tradition shouldn't suddenly be deemed unconstitutional."" But the 2nd Circuit appeals court concluded Greece officials were not diligent enough in efforts to find a more diverse set of voices from other faiths to open the public sessions, suggesting ""a single religious sect"" was being advanced. The high court is now being asked to offer more firm guidelines over when and if such public prayers are constitutionally acceptable. The case is Town of Greece, N.Y. v. Galloway (12-696).","A New York community has what it calls ""inclusive"" prayers at its town board sessions .

"Refuge opened the UK's first safe house for abused women and children in west London in 1971. Back then, domestic violence was still thought of as a private issue, to be dealt with behind closed doors. It was shrouded in myth and misunderstanding. Fast forward 42 years -- and sadly, it seems that very little has changed. Domestic violence takes place every single day, in households across the globe. People often think that it only happens in poor families, but the truth is that domestic violence affects women of all ages, classes and backgrounds. Abusive men are as likely to be lawyers, accountants and judges as they are cleaners or unemployed. Sometimes domestic violence is kept hidden, perpetrated in ways that are difficult to spot to the outside world. Many women have told me that their abusers hit them on parts of their body that do not show, or only become violent when the children are asleep. They tell me that their partners are very charming to other people -- a 'true gentleman' or an 'all-round nice guy'. But sometimes domestic violence spills out into the public arena. Abusive men may humiliate their partners in front of friends and family, putting them down, belittling everything they say. Sometimes they use physical force or gestures to intimidate and control their partners in social settings. In these situations, women may try to appease their partners to defuse the situation and reduce the risk of violence. In 2003, Refuge conducted a survey of 1,000 UK households which found that 42% of people had witnessed someone being verbally or physically abused by their partner in a social situation. All too often, however, people respond to this type of incident by turning a blind eye. They feel uncomfortable. They don't call the police. They still regard domestic violence as a 'private' matter. Shockingly, these attitudes are all too often echoed by the police, social workers and criminal justice professionals -- the very people who have a duty to safeguard the most vulnerable members of our society.  Police officers still fail to treat domestic violence as a serious crime. Reports of abuse are routinely dismissed, calls for help are downgraded, and dangerous men are left free to commit violence -- or worse. Refuge is currently working with the family of Maria Stubbings -- a young woman from Chelmsford, eastern England, who was brutally killed by her ex-partner Mark Chivers in 2008, despite making repeated calls for help to the police (Chivers, who had been convicted of murdering another woman, was later convicted of Maria's murder). Together, we are calling on the UK government to open a public inquiry into the response of the police and other state agencies to domestic violence victims. The truth is that domestic violence is a massive social problem. Last year, over one million women were abused in the UK, according to UK government statistics. Every week in England and Wales, two women are killed by current or former partners. Domestic violence is a crime. It is against the law. By failing to speak out against domestic violence, we condone it. We minimise it. We give violent men social permission to continue their abuse. By failing to speak out against domestic violence we also mirror the techniques used by perpetrators, who frequently try to deny or minimise their own behaviour. They may attribute their violence to things like alcohol or stress. They may blame the victim, saying that she 'provoked' or 'deserved' the abuse. The truth is that violence is always a choice. No woman is responsible for her abuser's actions. I have worked with survivors of domestic violence for 35 years. I know that domestic violence is rarely a one-off. We should never ignore that first slap or shove, because over time it can escalate into much worse. In extreme cases, domestic violence can be fatal. It's important that we recognise the signs of abuse at the earliest opportunities, and help women to get support before the violence escalates. Research shows that strangulation is a key risk factor for domestic homicide. Last year, almost 50% of the women Refuge supported had been strangled or choked by their abusers. Of course, in many cases, perpetrators don't use physical violence at all. Emotional abuse can be just as devastating as kicks and punches. The scars it leaves can be deeper, and take longer to heal. If a woman lives in a state of fear, changing her behaviour to avoid making her partner angry, she is being abused. Domestic violence is not a private issue. It is a social issue. It is a political issue. It is a moral issue. Above all, it's a crime -- a crime as serious as any other violent crime. Domestic violence affects us all. We all have a part to play in ending it.","Sandra Horley is chief executive of Refuge, domestic violence service provider in UK .

She says abuse often occurs in public situations and bystanders do nothing ."
"A Texas judge ordered a Fort Worth hospital to remove a pregnant and brain-dead woman from respirators and ventilators on Friday, perhaps ending a wrenching legal debate about who is alive, who is dead and how the presence of a fetus changes the equation. Erick Munoz,  husband of Marlise Munoz, broke down in tears after Judge R.H. Wallace told John Peter Smith Hospital  to act on his order by 5 p.m. Monday. Munoz and other family members had been fighting to have the body released for burial. Hospital officials resisted, saying they were  trying to obey a Texas law that says ""you cannot withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient,"" in the words of the hospital spokesman. Munoz left the courthouse without talking to reporters, but the family's lawyers spoke out. Jessica Janicek argued that the hospital was ""utilizing (Marlise Munoz's) body as a science experiment."" A breakthrough came when the hospital and the Munoz family agreed on crucial facts listed in a court document: that Marlise Munoz, 33, has ""met the clinical criteria for brain death since November 28"" and that ""the fetus gestating inside Mrs. Munoz is not viable."" The woman's husband repeatedly made these claims in his efforts to have her removed from the machines. Mom of pregnant woman: Change the law . The story may have more chapters. The hospital could appeal or decide to remove Marlise Munoz from a ventilator and respirator before that deadline. The judge did not rule on the constitutionality of a state law regarding the treatment of a pregnant patient. Erick and Marlise Munoz, two trained paramedics, had been awaiting the arrival of their second child when she was found unconscious on her kitchen floor around 2 a.m. November 26.  She was rushed to the north-central Texas hospital. Once there, Erick Munoz said, he was told his wife ""was for all purposes brain dead."" The family also says the fetus may have been deprived of oxygen. Erick Munoz had contended doctors told him his wife ""had lost all activity in her brain stem"" and an accompanying chart stated that she was ""brain dead."" Husband said wife didn't want to be on ventilator . During Friday's hearing in Fort Worth, representatives of the hospital -- in this case, from the Tarrant County District Attorney's office -- argued that state law was correctly applied. Erik Munoz and other family members said the hospital should abide by her wishes -- which weren't written down but, they said, relayed verbally to them -- and not have machines keep her organs and blood running. In an affidavit filed Thursday in court, Erick Munoz said little to him now is recognizable about Marlise. Her bones crack when her stiff limbs move. Her usual scent has been replaced by the ""smell of death."" And her once lively eyes have become ""soulless."" After the Friday hearing, another family lawyer, Jessica King, said, ""Pregnant women die every day. They die in car accidents, of heart attacks and other injuries. And when they die, their fetus dies with them. ""It's the way it's always been and the way it should be."" Lawyers: Records back claim that woman is brain dead . In his lawsuit, Munoz claims subsequent measures taken at the hospital -- and, in turn, the state law used to justify them -- amounted ""to nothing more than the cruel and obscene mutilation of a deceased body against the expressed will of the deceased and her family."" The hospital and the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office, which defended the medical facility, did not offer the same level of detail as members of the Munoz family. But earlier this month, hospital spokesman J.R. Labbe told CNN that his hospital believed ""the courts are the appropriate venue to provide clarity, direction and resolution in this matter."" Late Friday, the hospital issued this statement: ""JPS Health Network appreciates the potential impact of the consequences of the order on all parties involved and will be consulting with the Tarrant County District Attorney's office."" When life support is really 'death support'","Judge orders hospital to remove woman from ventilator, respirator .

"ABUSIR, Egypt (CNN) -- Today, I met Cleopatra's lawyer. Well, not her lawyer but someone who is determined to defend the legendary queen against centuries of bad publicity. Kathleen Martinez, an archaeologist from the Dominican Republic, wants to mend Cleopatra's tattered reputation. Kathleen Martinez is a young archaeologist from the Dominican Republic who has toiled for three years on a barren hillside overlooking the coastal highway linking Alexandria with the Libyan border. According to the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, it's here, at a spot known as Abusir, that the tomb of Marc Antony and Cleopatra might be located. I met Martinez in a dusty tomb full of bones at the excavation site. She recounted to me that, as a young girl, she listened in on a scholarly discussion in her father's library about Cleopatra. ""They were speaking very badly about her and about her image,"" she recalled. ""I got very upset. I said I didn't believe what they are saying, that I needed to study more about her."" Martinez went on to earn a law degree but continued to be fascinated by the saga of Cleopatra. Four years ago, she managed to convince Zahi Hawass, the untiring director of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, to allow her to start excavating at Abusir. Her fascination with -- and admiration for -- Cleopatra is intense. The last queen of Ancient Egypt, she told me, ""spoke nine languages, she was a philosopher, she was a poet, she was a politician, she was a goddess, and she was a warrior."" In short, Martinez believes, Cleopatra was a woman way ahead of her times. And given that history is written by the victors -- in Cleopatra's case, the Romans -- her press was somewhat less than complimentary. It was ""bad propaganda,"" in Martinez's words. For that reason, she told me, ""I want to be Cleopatra's lawyer."" With Hawass, Martinez is now working on a book about Cleopatra to repair all that damage. The tale of Antony and Cleopatra has fueled the popular imagination for centuries. Ill-fated lovers were a favorite theme for William Shakespeare, and the Roman noble and the Egyptian queen certainly fit the bill. Marc Antony was a no less fascinating character than Cleopatra. In his youth, he led a life of heavy drinking and womanizing. According to the Roman historian Plutarch, Antony accumulated debts of 250 talents, the equivalent of $5 million, before reaching 20. To escape his creditors in Rome, he fled to Greece, where he studied with the philosophers of Athens, before being called to join the Roman legions in the east, then serving under Julius Caesar. After Caesar's assassination, Marc Antony became embroiled in a series of power struggles and eventually ended up in Egypt. Egypt was the enemy of his former ally, Octavian, who would go on to become the Emperor Augustus, the first emperor of Rome. Octavian defeated Antony's forces at the battle of Actium in 30 B.C. Shortly afterward, Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide, he by his own sword, she by a poisonous asp. Octavian, according to Plutarch, allowed them to be buried together ""in splendid and regal fashion."" But no one knows where. The sudden focus on Antony and Cleopatra has also reignited an old debate over the latter's looks. Was Cleopatra a stunning beauty a la Elizabeth Taylor, or somewhat less spectacular? Researchers from Newcastle University in England claimed in 2007 that, based upon coins found from the period, she was quite homely, with ""a shallow forehead, long, pointed nose, narrow lips and a sharply pointed chin.""  See gallery of tomb that might be Cleopatra's » . The same researchers didn't have a very flattering assessment of Marc Antony either, saying he had ""bulging eyes, a large hooked nose and a thick neck."" No Richard Burton. This does contradict Plutarch's description of Marc Antony as having ""a noble dignity of form; and a shapely beard, a broad forehead, and an aquiline nose [that] were thought to show the virile qualities peculiar to the portraits and statues of Hercules""? Hawass hasn't had much to say in defense of Marc Antony, but he claims the coins found in Abusir show Cleopatra was ""beautiful."" At Abusir, he showed me one of the coins with Cleopatra's likeness. ""The only thing you can see here is her nose is a bit big."" That's because, Hawass insisted, ""when you draw a face on a coin you cannot draw the beauty of a queen, and therefore I think that the lady who captured the hearts of Julius Caesar and Marc Antony cannot have been ugly."" Egyptians, who are intensely proud of their country and its ancient heritage, may be forgiven for their insistence on this point. I tend to take the middle ground on this one. Beauty is more than skin deep, and what seems to have captivated Julius Caesar and Marc Antony was not physical but rather inner beauty.  Watch report from CNN's Ben Wedeman on Cleopatra » . Plutarch wrote in his ""Life of Antony"" that ""for her beauty was in itself not altogether incomparable, nor such as to strike those who saw her."" In other words, she was plain. Plutarch goes on to write, however, that she was intelligent, charming and has ""sweetness in the tones of her voice."" The mystery of what Cleopatra really looked like may never be solved. In any event, it's just one of many mysteries in Egypt. Others include the obvious ones: How were the pyramids built? Who built them? Why were they built? How old is the Sphinx? Hawass dismisses with lusty contempt the people who espouse the more fantastic theories (that aliens built the pyramids, that the Sphinx is more than 10,000 years old), labeling them ""pyramidiots."" But there are other historical mysteries out there that have yet to be answered. Some archaeologists are trying to find the tomb of Alexander the Great (who died in Babylon but, according to some ancient historians, was buried in Egypt). Others are searching for the remains of the lost army of Cambyses -- 50,000 soldiers dispatched on a mission by the Persian Emperor to attack the Oracle of Amon (today's Siwa Oasis in western Egypt) only to disappear during a sandstorm in the Sahara Desert. There has been plenty of excitement in the past few days over reports that Martinez and her team are about to find the long-lost tomb of Antony and Cleopatra. Alas, the enthusiasts are going to have to be patient. The summer residence of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is just down the road from the site. For security reasons, no one is allowed on the hillside where the excavations are taking place from May through November. So unless Mubarak decides to overrule his security detail, the solving of this mystery will have to be put on hold for at least another five months. We've waited 2,000 years. I guess we can wait a few more months.","Kathleen Martinez has toiled for three years in Egypt looking for Cleopatra's tomb .

"(CNN)It is some admission from one of the finest golfers ever to play the game. Tiger Woods -- a 14-time major champion and former world No. 1 -- is taking a break from the sport after admitting his game isn't up to scratch. The 39-year-old shot a career worst round of 82 at his first tournament of 2015 in Phoenix before withdrawing from his second at Torrey Pines due to injury. And he says he won't be back until both his body, and his game, are in tip top shape. ""This latest injury is not related to my previous surgery. I am having daily physical therapy and I am feeling better every day,"" Woods said in a statement on his official website. ""Right now, I need a lot of work on my game, and to still spend time with the people that are important to me. My play, and scores, are not acceptable for tournament golf. ""Like I've said, I enter a tournament to compete at the highest level, and when I think I'm ready, I'll be back. Next week I will practice at Medalist and at home getting ready for the rest of the year."" After his 2014 was blighted by a series of injuries, Woods' world ranking now stands at 62 -- the lowest since he turned professional back in 1996. His first appearance of the year at the Phoenix Open saw him miss the cut by 12 shots after shooting a second round of 82, the worst of his career. And he lasted just 11 holes at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines before pulling out due to difficulties with his back. It raises further questions as to whether Woods will ever be able to recapture the form that saw him snare 14 major titles during a glittering spell between 1997 and 2008. Despite a clutch of top five finishes since winning the U.S. Open in 2008, Woods missed two majors last year and recorded a best finish of 69th in the British Open. He stated his desire to feature at the Honda Classic, that starts in Florida on February 26, but says he will only play if his game is up to it. ""The last two weeks have been very disappointing to me, especially Torrey, because I never want to withdraw,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, lately injuries have made that happen too often. I am committed to getting back to the pinnacle of my game. ""I'd like to play The Honda Classic -- it's a tournament in my hometown and it's important to me -- but I won't be there unless my game is tournament-ready. ""That's not fair to anyone.

"Fifteen people, many of them teenagers and some as young as 11, were shot early Sunday morning at a Miami nightclub, Miami-Dade police reported. Police spokeswoman Frederica Burden said the victims ranged in age from 11 to 25 and were taken to area hospitals. Several victims were released from hospitals Sunday afternoon and a person who'd earlier been listed as critical was upgraded to critical but stable, police said in a news release. It's not clear whether the nightclub catered to teenagers. No public safety officials have explained why so many youths 16 and younger were inside a nightclub after the midnight Miami-Dade County curfew. Authorities said the shooting happened about 1 a.m. at The Spot nightclub at NW 64th Street and Seventh Avenue. CNN affiliate WPLG said a large party was being held when shooting broke out. Witnesses told police they heard about 100 gunshots, WPLG reported. ""At this point, we are not sure if we have one shooter or multiple shooters,"" Burden said. No arrests had been made by late Sunday. Police have yet to determine whether good surveillance video exists to help in the investigation, WPLG said. The club had recently begun to allow teen parties on the weekends, the affiliate reported. Capt. Ignatius Carroll of Miami Fire Rescue said the scene was chaotic when emergency medical personnel arrived. Wounded people were found inside the club and on the sidewalk, he said. ""We understand there was a gathering taking place at some sort of little nightclub,"" he said. ""We had a large crowd."" With so many wounded people, emergency responders had to treat some victims on the sidewalk. Burden didn't know a motive for the shooting. ""Investigators are interviewing witnesses at this time, but we are also asking the public for their help by providing us with any information they may have on this incident,"" she said. According to CNN affiliate WFOR, the Miami-Dade County curfew makes it against the law for children younger than 17 to be out on their own between midnight and 6 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. The curfew is 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. other nights.","Shooting happened about 1 a.m. Sunday at The Spot nightclub in Miami .

"The biennial Dubai Airshow began Sunday with the Gulf region's major carriers announcing some of the biggest aviation deals in history. There was as much speculation swirling around the size of the orders before the event as there was desert sand outside the nearby Al Maktoum airport. However few predicted that $192.3 billion worth of deals for commercial jets (at list prices) would be announced on the first day -- a new record that has outstripped the orders from the entire 2007 airshow. The region's three big players -- Etihad, Emirates and Qatar Airways -- announced orders for 393 new commercial planes. Boeing and Airbus shared the spoils, with high demand for the 777X, Boeing's next-generation version of the existing 777. The Abu Dhabi based airline Etihad was the first to lay down a marker at the event: a $25.2B deal for 56 new wide-bodied Boeing aircraft, including 25 777X planes, 17 of the biggest 777-9X variants and eight of the 777-8X version. ""This order enables us to build upon our achievements, using the next generation of aircraft to support our next generation of development,"" said Etihad CEO James Hogan. ""This order is for 2018 out to 2025/2030. The traffic is there."" Later Hogan trumped his Boeing order with an announcement for 87 Airbus jets worth $26.9B at list price, including 50 A350 aircraft, the twin-aisle competitor of the 777X currently in development. The airline is also set to be the biggest operator of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, with a new order for 30 of the new planes to add its current deal for 41 of the composite, medium to long-distance jets. But it was Dubai's Emirates that revealed the largest order with a $76B deal  for 150 Boeing 777X planes, plus an additional 50 Airbus A380s, worth $23 billion, to bring its order of the superjumbo up to 101. The airline currently operates 39 of the world's largest commercial jet. Low-cost carrier FlyDubai committed to purchasing 111 Boeing 737 jets worth $11.4B. Doha-based Qatar Airlines added to the impressive figures for Boeing's 777X with a $19B order for 50 of the aircraft. Lufthansa will be the forth ""launch airline"" to receive the new model jet when delivery begins from 2020 onwards. It has 34 on order. The aircraft is the latest iteration of the company's 777 series and will be manufactured with all new composite material wings. With a wingspan of 71 meters, the 777-9X is greater than the 747-800. ""With around $100B worth of orders, this makes it the largest aviation product launch,"" said Boeing Chairman and CEO Jim McNeary. ""We look forward to ... continuing to support Dubai's expansion into a global aviation hub."" Finding room for the new aircraft in Dubai should not be a problem as the Al-Maktoum airport is the city's second international hub and predicted to be the world's largest when completed. Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum was at the show and supportive of the new airport and mega deals. ""We cannot operate from one airport with all these planes,"" he told CNN's John Defterios after the Emirate's announcement. ""The passengers are growing so much and a lot of people are coming and going from here to America, to Europe and Asia. So Emirates has to be strong and so does FlyDubai."" Hogan predicts passenger numbers for Etihad to grow by 14% annually for the next five years, while Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, Emirates' CEO, believes the numbers will come as more countries open up. ""We don't want anything below double digital growth in passenger numbers,"" he said. ""Some countries may be scared (to open up their markets), but they really have to open up.""","More than $160 billion in orders by Gulf airlines agreed in first three hours .

"Twitter is on the verge of its initial public offering and everyone's knickers have been in a knot all week over the company's lack of management diversity -- that is, women. As The New York Times put it last week, ""The board? All white men. The investors? All men. The executive officers? All men but for the general counsel, Vijaya Gadde, who has had the job for five weeks."" Question: Why is this a problem? First, there aren't enough women at Twitter or in the tech world because there aren't enough women anywhere. Some facts: Women make up 6% of chief executives at the leading 100 tech companies, and that has taken years to accomplish. Most startups have all-male boards. In 2012 women held 16.6% of Fortune 500 board seats. Women of color were 3.3% of the total. Fully one-tenth had no women serving on their boards at all. In the past five years, women and minorities have lost ground despite evidence strongly suggesting that gender parity and board diversity have positive effects on profitability. Twitter had more than a year to prepare for this IPO: Where are the women? The company's immediate response  focused on a ""paucity of candidates."" The tech industry has a well-documented pipeline problem, one largely the result of gender stereotypes that reach into the educational system. However, companies regularly draw executives from outside their own industries -- sometimes, yes, even women -- when seeking senior-level and board positions. It enables them to cross-pollinate ideas, diversify their expertise and innovate. For example, Apple has hired Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts. During her tenure at Burberry, the company doubled its revenues and tripled its share price. Companies redefine ""pipeline"" every day -- particularly when profits are involved. The technology sector dresses itself up as progressive when in reality it shows every indication of being, at its core, powerfully retrograde. Despite investing in diversity programs, the management of tech firms is distinctly not diverse, and indeed the industry continues to ""dazzle"" with incidents in which men gleefully display their not even implicit biases. Last month's Titshare debacle (click and weep), as well as Business Insider's long-overdue firing of CTO Pax Dickinson (who'd for years been churning out such sexist, racist, tweets as ""Jesus gets raped by a pack of n****s. It's his own fault for dressing like a whore though"") are two recent examples. Second, sexism is seamlessly coupled with the distribution of capital. Bryan Goldberg's September launch of Bustle, a ""women's centric"" website (""world news and politics alongside beauty tips"") was a blunt force case in point. After announcing the site with a tone-deaf post, Goldberg was widely mocked for his personal failure to grasp, among other things, how ridiculous his claim to be starting the ""first site of its kind"" for women was. The real issue isn't Goldberg's cluelessness, but the institutional biases that enabled him to raise $6.5 million when far more able, knowledgeable and experienced women can't. Companies with at least one woman founder make up only 13% of those funded. Venture capitalists are less likely to invest in startups if there are women involved in their management; investors actively reduce holdings in companies that appoint female directors. These are particular ironies since women-run startups use 40% less capital to launch. These facts don't reflect women lacking in confidence ideas. They illustrate discrimination, whether it is conscious or not. Third, while we think of Twitter as a tech company, it is a media company and part of a larger environment that does little to correct its failure at diversity. Year after year, studies such as one last week from the Directors Guild of America, as well as reports from Who Makes the News and the Women's Media Center Status on Women in Media document exactly how distorted mainstream media ownership, management and production remain. Only online is the situation improving. But even there the difference is largely gains in women-oriented ""pink-collar"" content. How can we separate these facts from ownership? We can't. As reported by the Federal Communications Commission, our media are almost entirely owned and managed by white men. Lastly, what does this have to do with speech? Everything. Male experiences, interests, expectations and voices, mainly white, inform the way we think, decide how our resources are dispersed and define our norms. The ghettoized status of women and minorities in media and technology, coupled with the lack of venture capital investments, means that our attempts to express ourselves are limited, misrepresented and regularly repackaged to make what we say palatable to a sexist status quo. And this status quo is entirely uninterested in the idea of women as capable, autonomous leaders who might change norms in unsettling, risky ways. Stating these facts baldly is not an indictment of white men as individuals. It is a description of systemic problems that we refuse to confront with systemic solutions. The presence of a carefully selected handful of women in tech, regardless of how determined, able and prominently visible they are, has for decades done little to alter the makeup of management and ownership.  Gender diversity at Twitter, as elsewhere, isn't a priority because people make reasonable decisions about what they believe will be profitable and successful: Twitter is looking for experience and expertise within a comfort zone. ""This to me is not a gender issue, it's an innovation issue,"" Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has explained. Gender issues aren't innovation issues only if your gender is dominant and the norm. This rationale, and others like it, are exactly the kind of ""1,000 paper cuts"" marginalization that result in fewer women pursuing  tech careers to begin with. Twitter is one part of a male dominated social structure, economy and culture, all of which rely on cradle-to-grave sexism to be profitable. That's tweetable by the way.","Soraya Chemaly: Twitter, on verge of IPO, is under fire with leadership that's virtually all men .

"When 33-year-old Ashoo Mongia visits the supermarket it's rarely for stocking up his fridge for the week. As head of a cow protection enforcement team, he regularly scours Delhi grocery stores and outdoor markets for food products containing cow beef. For the last 15 years, Mongia and his team of 120 Delhi-based volunteers have thrown themselves in a battle that pits India's billon-dollar meat industry and growing underground beef trade against Hindu traditionalists keen on preserving the holy status of cows. ""The cow is our mother, it's our duty to protect her,"" said Mongia, who monitors and raids hundreds of stores, butcher shops and slaughterhouses suspected of carrying, selling or slaughtering India's blessed bovines. ""We do this because we believe in what the cow represents in our country, our culture and in the Hindu religion."" This year, India will displace the United States as the world's third largest beef exporter, behind Brazil and Australia. In just the first half of 2012, India exported $1.24 billion worth of meat, and a 30 percent growth in revenue from 2010 exports is projected by the end of the year, according to a U.S. Beef Export Federation study. While the bulk of Indian exports is buffalo meat bound for Middle East and Southeast Asian markets, the growing middle class in Arab countries has sparked a new craving for cow beef. The rise in demand could make India the world's king beef exporter by 2013, according to USDA estimates. But as India continues its struggle for economic and political dominance in South Asia, there is concern that Hindu-mandated bans on beef could hamper the industry's future growth, particularly in states like Kerala and West Bengal where the practice is legal. Relied on by generations of Indians for tilling fields, dairy products and dung fuel, the cow is regarded by Hindus as gau mata, or maternal figure, and has had a long-standing central role in India's religious rituals. Those religious attitudes, however, are viewed by some Indian business leaders as a major hindrance to commerce. ""Cow beef could be a very lucrative business in India,"" said Dr. S.K. Ranjhan, the director of Hind Agro Industries Limited, who believes that religious attitudes may stand to change once the extent of business opportunities are realized. ""I think five-to-10 years from now, people won't be so scandalized by the sale of cow beef."" The majority of India's 24 states outlaw the slaughter of cows except under extenuating circumstances: to stifle contagious diseases, prevent pain and suffering, medical research, etc. And several states -- including Delhi and Rajasthan, among others -- ban the sale and slaughter of cows altogether. The strict laws against cow slaughter in the majority of India's provinces have forced the lucrative cow beef trade underground. An estimated 1.5 million cows, valued at up to $500 million, are smuggled out of India annually, which some analysts say provide more than 50% of beef consumed in neighboring Bangladesh. ""When you consider just how much money is made from underground cow smuggling, it becomes clear that not only is there a huge amount at stake, but a huge demand that butchers and slaughterhouses are catering to,"" said Dr. Zarin Ahmad, a fellow at the Centre de Sciences Humaines in New Delhi, who has extensively studied the work and trade among India's butcher communities. Working with Mongia's enforcement team is Parmanand Mittal, a cow-advocacy lawyer who works from a home-office on the outskirts of Delhi. Throughout the day, Mittal fields a stream of phone calls -- tipsters who have caught wind of illegal slaughterhouses and owners of gau shalas, or cow sanctuaries, concerned with unexpected expenses associated with new rescues. In Mittal's office hangs a painting of Lord Krishna — one of the most revered divinities in Hinduism— with his arm resting affectionately on a white calf. While Mongia's crew breaks up the slaughterhouses, Mittal builds a legal case for prosecution. His backlog of casework extensive, Mittal says. While there might be money to be made from adding cow beef to current exports, India would incur costs elsewhere, Mittal says. ""Cows have long been the source of fuel, manure and fertilizer, among other things. These animals are revered because they've played a large role in the welfare and livelihood of all Indians,"" Mittal said. ""Take away the cow and the repercussions will be huge.""","India will become the world's third largest beef exporter this year.

"Three people in Colorado may have died after smoking synthetic marijuana, state health officials fear. The Colorado Department of Public Health has launched an investigation into an outbreak of illnesses at hospitals that may be tied to the dangerous substance. ""Initial reports show approximately 75 people who reported smoking a form of synthetic marijuana may have been seen at hospitals in the Denver metro area and Colorado Springs beginning in late August,"" said Dr. Tista Ghosh, interim chief medical officer for the state, in a written statement. ""Several individuals were in intensive care and three deaths are being investigated as possibly associated."" The Colorado Department of Health, with help from local health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will attempt to figure out if the synthetic marijuana is to blame, and if so, whether all the patients were sickened by the same product or different ones. But ""don't wait for the results of this investigation,"" Ghosh urged. ""If you have synthetic marijuana, stop using it and destroy it."" Teen narrowly escapes death after smoking synthetic marijuana . Known as K2, Spice, Black Mamba, Mr. Smiley and Blaze, among other things, synthetic marijuana can have more serious consequences than regular marijuana, which is legal in Colorado. These synthetic cannabinoids are a blend of plant and herbal materials that have been sprayed with chemicals, producing an extra toxicity, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Sold most often on the Internet, synthetic marijuana produces euphoric and psychoactive effects similar to those associated with marijuana. But doctors say there are additional side effects that may be particularly dangerous. The drug can leave patients catatonic and listless. And what makes matters worse, very little is known about synthetic marijuana or how to treat an adverse reaction or overdose. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the number of calls to poison centers related to synthetic drugs soared from about 3,200 in 2010 to more than 13,000 in 2011. ""Easy access and the misperception that Spice products are 'natural' and therefore harmless have likely contributed to their popularity,"" the NIDA website states. ""Another selling point is that the chemicals used in Spice are not easily detected in standard drug tests."" Because the chemicals used in these products have a high potential for abuse and no medical benefit, the DEA has designated five of the most common active chemicals frequently found in synthetic marijuana as Schedule I controlled substances, making it illegal to sell, buy, or possess them. But manufacturers seem to be changing the chemical compounds as fast as lawmakers enact legislation to ban them. The CDC was sending a team of four to assist the investigation.","75 people in Colorado may have become sickened after smoking synthetic marijuana .

"(CNN) -- The Grammys may have taken a slow, piecemeal route in issuing nominations Friday, but Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Sam Smith and U2 were very much up to speed. Beyonce led all nominees with six Grammy nods, giving her a total of 53 for her career. That cements her place as the most-nominated female artist in history, the Recording Academy -- which presents the Grammys -- observed in a news release. The last one came with album of the year, which was named Friday night on a concert special, ""A Very Grammy Christmas."" Beyonce's self-titled release of late last year made the list, along with Beck's ""Morning Phase,"" Sam Smith's ""In the Lonely Hour,"" Pharrell's ""Girl"" and Ed Sheeran's ""X."" Beyonce's other nominations are for best R&B performance, best R&B song, best urban contemporary album, best surround-sound album and best music film. Newcomer Smith equaled Beyonce with six nominations. His nominations were in the big three -- album record and song of the year -- as well as best new artist, best pop solo performance and best pop vocal album. ""Stay with Me"" was picked for both record and song of the year. And Swift? Though her album ""1989"" came out too late to qualify for the Grammys, her single ""Shake It Off"" did well. It was nominated for song and record of the year. Swift also received a third nomination, for pop solo performance. The other record of the year nominees are ""Fancy"" by Iggy Azalea featuring Charli XCX, ""Chandelier"" by Sia and ""All About That Bass"" by Meagan Trainor. Song of the year nominations -- a songwriter's honor -- went to ""All About That Bass,"" ""Chandelier,"" ""Shake It Off,"" ""Stay with Me"" and Hozier's ""Take Me to Church."" Smith's competition in the new artist category includes Azalea, Haim, Bastille and Brandy Clark. The old guard, U2, wasn't to be denied. Its album ""Songs of Innocence"" received a nod for best rock album, giving the band 46 nominations -- a record for a group. Even Miley Cyrus got into the act. She received her first Grammy nomination ever for her album ""Bangerz,"" which was nominated for best pop vocal album. The Grammys tried something new this year. Instead of releasing all the nominations at once, the Recording Academy put them out in dribs and drabs: a handful on CBS's ""This Morning"" and most of the others on Twitter, some through artist accounts. Naturally, the idea earned some criticism. ""This just seems ... odd for such a major show,"" wrote the Washington Post's Emily Yahr. Nevertheless, the musicians have been appreciative. ""Grammy nom and my album multiply has sold 3 million worldwide as of this morning.

"It sounds like a dangerous combination: massive tanks holding chemicals near a major water supply. That was the setup in West Virginia last week when a chemical spill contaminated a river supplying water to hundreds of thousands of people. Officials say there wasn't much regulation at the site where the spill occurred and that little is known about the chemical that leaked. Now, state officials say they're considering increasing oversight. ""Absolutely,"" Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin told CNN. ""We need to do what we can to see that this kind of incident never happens again. There's no excuse for it."" Two U.S. congressmen say the spill exposes regulatory gaps in the country's chemical control laws. And many in the area are asking key questions: What caused thousands of gallons of a chemical used to clean coal to spill into the water? How dangerous is the chemical? And why didn't anyone catch the problem sooner? See West Virginia American Water Co. status map . State regulators inspected site in 1991, 2010, 2012 . The facility where the leak occurred is owned by Freedom Industries, which supplies products for the coal-mining industry. The chemical that spilled, known as MCHM, is used to treat coal to reduce the amount of ash. A state environmental inspector visited the site in 2010 after a complaint about an odor, said Randy Huffman, the head of the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection. ""We went out on site and didn't find anything that would cause concern, no leaks or anything like that,"" Huffman said. The licorice smell given off by the chemical that spilled, 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, can emerge when it is transferred to or from the facility -- not just during a leak. Inspectors visited the plant again in 2012 to determine whether any processes had changed that would require the company to obtain additional air quality permits, Huffman said. The inspectors decided no new permits were needed, and they wouldn't have inspected the tanks where Thursday's leak occurred, he said. Before that, the last inspection at the site had been in 1991. That inspection took place because the Charleston plant stored different materials that required regulation, said Tom Aluise, spokesman for the environmental protection department. State environmental officials said the facility had the only permit it was required to have: an industrial storm water permit. ""Basically they had to monitor the runoff from the rain and send us the results every quarter. Those were the only regulatory requirements,"" Huffman said. ""The materials they were storing there is not a hazardous material."" That's because the facility didn't process the chemicals, he said. It just stored them. The company was responsible for maintaining the tanks, Huffman said. ""There's not necessarily the kind of robust environmental controls that people might anticipate that there should be on these types of facilities,"" he said. That's left West Virginia officials trying ""to beef up what could be viewed as a loophole with these kinds of facilities."" Booth Goodwin, the U.S. attorney in Charleston, said he's investigating whether any laws were broken when the chemical leaked into the Elk River. But even if no regulations were violated, rules in the state could change as a result of the spill. ""We are writing to request that you immediately schedule a hearing to examine the regulatory gaps that this incident has exposed in the nation's toxic chemical control laws,"" Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-California, and Rep. Paul D. Tonko, D-New York said in a letter Monday. Little known about chemical . Government health and safety officials say they don't know much about MCHM. But they told about 300,000 people in nine counties to stop using the water once they discovered that 7,500 gallons of the chemical had leaked on Thursday. On Monday, they said people in some areas could start using the water again and assured them that it would be safe. This much is clear: somehow the chemical leaked out of the storage tank, breached a concrete wall surrounding the tank, seeped into the soil and reached the water supply. ""My guy said you could see it bubbling up out of the ground, and there was no question what was going on,"" Huffman said. Freedom Industries President Gary Southern said last week that residents' safety had been his company's first priority since he learned about the leak. ""We have been working with local and federal regulatory, safety and environmental entities ... and are following all necessary steps to fix the issue,"" he said. ""Our team has been working around the clock since the discovery to contain the leak to prevent further contamination."" An emergency official told CNN that when he saw the tank, it looked old. ""I would say the tank was antique,"" said C.W. Sigman, deputy director of emergency services in Kanawha County. Elizabeth Scharman, West Virginia's poison control director, told CNN last week that the chemical inside the tanks had not been studied. ""We don't know the safety info, how quickly it goes into air, its boiling point,"" she said. That raises an important question, Waxman and Tonko said Monday. ""It is critically important that we understand how the law allowed a potentially harmful chemical to remain virtually untested for nearly forty years. ... We should not have to wait for a major contamination event to learn the most basic information about a toxic chemical in commerce,"" they said. A 2005 fact sheet about the chemical filed with West Virginia environmental officials offered guidance for what to do if a large spill is detected: ""Prevent runoff from entering drains, sewers, or streams.""","State inspectors visited the site in 2012, 2010 and 1991, officials say .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department on Tuesday weighed in on one of the most explosive issues in American politics, filing a lawsuit to overturn a tough new Arizona immigration law that has sharply divided people along partisan, ideological and ethnic lines. It also asked the federal courts to grant an injunction to stop enforcement of the measure before it takes effect late this month. Arizona's law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and allows police to question the residency status of people in the course of enforcing another law. It also targets businesses that hire illegal immigrant laborers or knowingly transport them. Justice Department lawyers argued that the state statute should be declared invalid because it has improperly preempted federal law. ""In our constitutional system, the power to regulate immigration is exclusively vested in the federal government,"" the brief said. ""The immigration framework set forth by Congress and administered by federal agencies reflects a careful and considered balance of national law enforcement, foreign relations, and humanitarian concerns -- concerns that belong to the nation as a whole, not a single state."" How do you feel about the Arizona immigration law? However, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said it was ""wrong that our own federal government is suing the people of Arizona for helping to enforce federal immigration law."" ""Today's filing is nothing more than a massive waste of taxpayer funds,"" Brewer said in a statement. ""These funds could be better used against the violent Mexican cartels than the people of Arizona."" The government's brief said the U.S. Constitution and federal law ""do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country."" ""Although a state may adopt regulations that have an indirect or incidental effect on aliens, a state may not establish its own immigration policy or enforce state laws in a manner that interferes with federal immigration law,"" the brief said. ""The State of Arizona has crossed this constitutional line."" The brief contends that the Arizona law ""disrupts federal enforcement priorities and resources that focus on aliens who pose a threat to national security or public safety. ... If allowed to go into effect, [its] mandatory enforcement scheme will conflict with and undermine the federal government's careful balance of immigration enforcement priorities and objectives."" The Justice Department highlighted statements in support of the lawsuit from the sheriff of Arizona's Santa Cruz County and several Department of Homeland Security officials, among others. President Barack Obama said in a speech July 1 that the Arizona measure has ""fanned the flames of an already contentious debate."" Among other things, it puts pressure on police officers to enforce rules that are ""unenforceable"" while making communities less safe -- in part, by making people more reluctant to report crimes, he said. The law also has ""the potential of violating the rights of innocent American citizens and legal residents, making them subject to possible stops or questioning because of what they look like or how they sound."" Arizona's two Republican senators, however, immediately blasted the decision to file the lawsuit. ""The American people must wonder whether the Obama administration is really committed to securing the border when it sues a state that is simply trying to protect its people by enforcing immigration law,"" Sens. Jon Kyl and John McCain said in a statement. The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee also ripped the decision. ""Not only does this lawsuit reveal the Obama administration's contempt for immigration laws and the people of Arizona, it reveals contempt for the majority of the American people who support Arizona's efforts to reduce human smuggling, drug trafficking and illegal immigration,"" said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. ""Arizona's law simply applies state penalties to acts already illegal under federal law."" Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Arizona, released a statement calling the lawsuit a ""sideshow."" ""A court battle between the federal government and Arizona will not move us closer to securing the border or fixing America's broken immigration system,"" she said. Brewer, a Republican, said the Arizona law was designed ""to complement, not supplant, enforcement of federal immigration laws,"" and that she would fight the government lawsuit with the help of a legal defense fund set up to pay the legal fees. ""Our laws will be found to be constitutional -- because that is exactly what they are,"" Brewer's statement said. Obama renewed his push for comprehensive immigration reform last week, calling for bipartisan cooperation on an issue reflecting deep social and political divisions. Seeking an elusive middle ground on the subject, the president highlighted the importance of immigrants to American history and progress while acknowledging the fear and frustration many feel with a system that he said seems ""fundamentally broken."" He asserted that the majority of Americans are ready to embrace reform legislation that would help resolve the status of an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. In his July 1 speech, Obama warned that rounding up everyone in the country who has entered illegally would be both ""logistically impossible"" and ""tear at the fabric of the nation."" At the same time, the president indicated it would be wrong to offer blanket amnesty for people who came into the United States unlawfully. Despite Obama's call for bipartisan immigration reform, several senior Democratic sources said last week they see virtually no chance of Congress taking up such a measure before November's midterm elections. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. national poll conducted in late May showed 57 percent of Americans backing the Arizona law, with 37 percent opposed to it. The poll also indicated that public support for beefing up security along the U.S. border with Mexico has grown significantly. According to the survey, nearly nine out of 10 Americans want to increase U.S. law enforcement along the border with Mexico. Eight in 10 questioned also supported a program that would allow illegal immigrants already in the United States to stay here and apply for legal residency, provided they had a job and paid back taxes. But only 38 percent say that program should be a higher priority than border security and other get-tough proposals. Six in 10 said border security was the higher priority.

"The news that Charlize Theron adopted an African American baby has fired up a debate regularly stoked by the likes of A-listers Madonna, Angelina Jolie and Sandra Bullock.   All have adopted transracially.  And everyone has an opinion. In the United States  in 2010, black children left the care system at a rate of 24 percent,  while white children left at a rate of 43 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  In the UK, where I live, a black child is three times less likely to be adopted from care than a white child.  And until recently, UK guidelines on adoption have made it difficult to adopt between races. But the policy is changing after Michael Gove, the UK's Education Secretary said it was ""outrageous"" to deny a child the chance of adoption because ""of a misguided belief that race is more important than any other factor."" In the UK, a black child is three times less likely to be adopted from care than a white child. Indeed, the American 1994 Multi-Ethnic Placement Act ""affirms the prohibition against delaying or denying the placement of a child for adoption or foster care on the basis of race, color or national origin of the foster or adoptive parents or of the child involved."" Read more: Adopted kids' drug abuse risk affected by biological family . So, with it becoming 'easier' to adopt a child from a different race -- does this make it right? It is a controversial question that I'm not going to seek to answer within the short confines of this article. However, my own experiences of living with a white British family have been positive and one can argue that this was because I still maintained contact with my birth family via visits to Nigeria. But not every transracially fostered or adopted child's experience is as positive. Having spoken to adults who were fostered or adopted by different races in the past, I hear them speak with a deeply-embedded emotional scar connected with feelings of detachment from their roots and holding onto inaccurate preconceived ideas about their culture. Indeed, the culturally confused character of my latest novel 'Being Lara' also embodies this detachment. Lara's adoptive white family had done everything a good family should do -- they'd loved, protected and nurtured her- but never had that talk on race. And such a talk is crucial within a transracial adoption setting. In fact, such talks may be necessary frequently throughout the years. I am by no means an authority on cross-cultural or transracial adoption. It is an emotive and important subject. But whilst a positive outlook is important for anyone embarking on such a journey, the prospective adoptive parent will also need to acknowledge the negativity that could arise and make sure they don't shy away from confronting it. Really confront it. You can't behave like the mother in my book, who brushes off her daughter Lara's questions after the child is racially abused in the street by saying, ""I have ginger hair -- I'm also different."" So, as a multitude of Hollywood stars and average folk seek to adopt children cross racially, the question moves away from the ""right and wrongs,"" and then becomes: ""How best to do it?"" In 2008, the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute in New York released a study that suggested foster parents of minority children should receive special training and preparation for the challenges inherent in interracial foster care. Prospective parents may want to consider the following: . •Openly confronting racism . •Carefully examining their own beliefs and attitudes surrounding race and ethnicity . •Educating themselves on skin and hair maintenance for the child . •Include in the family, cultural traditions, customs and foods of the child's origin. •Living within a multicultural community and allowing the child to attend a racially mixed school. This all might seem a lot. And it is! Plus there are no guarantees at the end of it. But it is important and it should be-- some say parenting is the most important job in the world! See also: Top 10 parenting fails of 2011 . There is no denying adoption is an emotional subject.  But the readiness of any adult to make such a selfless commitment to a child, is an act that should be commended and viewed fairly -- whatever their culture or race.","Writer Lola Jaye says statistics show that black babies are less likely to be adopted than white ones in U.S. and UK.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration announced Wednesday that it will begin sending condolence letters to the next-of-kin of service members who commit suicide, said a White House statement. ""This issue is emotional, painful, and complicated,"" President Barack Obama said in the statement.  ""But these Americans served our nation bravely ... we need to do everything in our power to honor their service, and to help them stay strong for themselves, for their families and for our nation."" The move comes nearly six weeks after a group of senators -- 10 Democrats and one Republican -- asked President Barack Obama to change what they called an ""insensitive"" policy that dates back several administrations. U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer led the bipartisan group and was pleased with the administration's policy change. ""This will ... do a great deal to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health treatment that prevents so many from seeking the care they need,"" she said in a statement Wednesday. The lack of condolence letters in instances of suicide has been the subject of protest by some military families. ""It's bittersweet,"" said Gregg Keesling, father to Army Spc. Chancellor Keesling, who killed himself while serving in Iraq.  ""It does not bring our son back, but I think it does send a powerful message that mental health in our military can be addressed."" CNN first reported in 2009 about the family of Army Spc. Keesling. The family set up a wall to pay tribute to Keesling in their Indiana home. Along with his uniform and the flag from his burial service, a space was left for the expected condolence letter from the commander in chief. Upset when they learned a suicide did not merit a letter from the president, Gregg Keesling wrote to the president and the Army chief of staff requesting the policy be changed. He argued that his son's suicide was a result of what he was exposed to during war and that it deserved to be considered caused by battle. ""They didn't die because they were weak,"" said the president's statement.  ""And the fact that they didn't get the help they needed must change."" According to an Army report last year, annual suicide rates in the Marine Corps and the Army -- the two branches most involved in combat operations in Iraq and Afganistan -- increased steadily between 2004 and 2009, to more than 20 per 100,000 people. During that time the rate for those two branches surpassed the age-adjusted, national civilian average, whereas suicide rates for the Air Force and Navy stayed below the national average. In 2001, the suicide rate among Marines, like the Air Force and Navy, was about half the civilian rate, and the Army's, while higher than the other three branches, was still below the civilian rate, according to the Army report.

"Forty years after they were convicted by a jury of firebombing a grocery store in Wilmington, North Carolina, civil rights activists who became known as the ""Wilmington 10"" were pardoned Monday by the state's outgoing governor. ""These convictions were tainted by naked racism and represent an ugly stain on North Carolina's criminal justice system that cannot be allowed to stand any longer,"" said Gov. Beverly Perdue. ""Justice demands that this stain finally be removed."" In 1972, nine black men and one white woman were convicted in the store firebombing in the coastal city despite their claims of innocence and their supporters' vehement argument that the defendants were victims of racially biased prosecutors. Their sentences were reduced in 1978 by the state's governor then, Jim Hunt, and two years later their convictions were overturned in federal court for reasons of misconduct by the prosecutors. But until Monday there were no pardons, and the sting of the guilty verdicts still followed the six surviving members of the group that was known nationwide as the Wilmington 10. Perdue said that among the key evidence that led her to grant pardons of innocence were recently discovered notes from the prosecutor who picked the jury. The notes showed the prosecutor preferred white jurors who might be members of the Ku Klux Klan and one black juror was described as an ""Uncle Tom type."" Perdue also pointed to the federal court's ruling that the prosecutor knew his star witness lied on the witness stand. That witness and other witnesses recanted a few years after the trial. Timothy Tyson, a North Carolina historian and a visiting professor at Duke University, said he was given the notes two years ago and started to go through them recently when the NAACP called again for pardons for the Wilmington 10. ""It was pretty shocking stuff,"" he told CNN on Monday. There were at least six potential jurors with ""KKK Good!!"" written next to them, he said. Next to a woman's name it said, ""NO, she associates with Negroes."" On the back of the legal pad, the prosecutor, Jay Stroud, had apparently written the advantages and disadvantages of a mistrial, Tyson said. One of the advantages was a fresh start with a new jury. Stroud told the Wilmington StarNews in October that the handwriting on the legal pad was his, but people were misinterpreting his notes. ""I could have had an all-white jury, but I didn't want to do that. Why would I leave a KKK on the jury?"" Stroud said. He told the newspaper that he wanted ""blacks who could be fair"" on the jury. It was actually the second jury that ruled on the case. The first jury was dismissed after a mistrial was declared when Stroud said he was ill. That jury had two whites. Tyson said the early 1970s were ""really hard and really bad"" and a ""bubbling cauldron"" of racially heated struggles in the state. North Carolina had the largest number of Ku Klux Klan members in the country, he said, but there was also a strong African-American freedom movement. ""(The time) was seething with anger and resentment and fear and rage,"" he said. And one of the Wilmington 10 was the Rev. Benjamin Chavis, whom Tyson described as a handsome, fearless civil rights leader who came from a brilliant family. He was a threat to the ""old guard"" of North Carolina leaders. Chavis was a target for police even before the firebombing occurred, Tyson said. Chavis, who would become the head of the NAACP in 1993, was paroled in 1979. Most of the others involved in the case struggled after they were set free. ""Things went badly for them,"" Tyson said. ""Many of them had their health broken in prison.""","Outgoing governor says convictions were ""tainted by naked racism""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Army and Marine Corps are allowing convicted felons to serve in increasing numbers, newly released Department of Defense statistics show. A U.S Marine keeps a watchful eye in downtown Baghdad. Recruits were allowed to enlist after having been convicted of crimes including assault, burglary, drug possession and making terrorist threats. The statistics were released by Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. He has given the Pentagon a month to hand over up-to-date details on the number of waivers granted, reports on how the recruits have performed and information about how the waivers are related to meeting recruitment goals. Pentagon statistics show the Army granted 511 felony waivers in 2007, just over twice the 249 it granted the year before. The Army aims to recruit more than 80,000 new soldiers a year. The Marines -- which recruits fewer new service members each year than the Army -- also reported a rise in waivers for felonies, with 350 granted in 2007, compared with 208 in 2006. ""There was a rapid rise in 2007 in the number of waivers the Army and Marine Corps granted to recruits convicted of serious felonies,"" Waxman said in a letter Monday to David Chu, the under-secretary of defense for personnel and readiness. ""I understand that there can be valid reasons for personnel waivers and recognize the importance of providing opportunities to individuals who have served their sentences and rehabilitated themselves. ""At the same time, concerns have been raised that the significant increase in the recruitment of persons with criminal records is a result of the strain put on the military by the Iraq war and may be undermining military readiness,"" he charged. The Army defended its use of waivers as a response to a changing American society, arguing that only three in 10 Americans of military age ""meet all our stringent medical, moral, aptitude or administrative requirements."" ""Today's young men and women are more overweight, have a greater incidence of asthma, and are being charged for offenses that in earlier years wouldn't have been considered a serious offense, and might not have resulted in charges in the first place,"" John P. Boyce Jr. of Army Public Affairs said in a statement to CNN. He said the Army never issues waivers for some types of offenses, including sexual violence, alcoholism and drug trafficking. But the Pentagon statistics showed the Army allowed 106 convicted burglars to enlist in 2007, up from 36 the year before. It also granted waivers to 43 recruits convicted of aggravated assault that year, up from 33 a year before; and to 130 people convicted of possession of drugs other than marijuana, a rise from 71 in 2006. It also allowed two people convicted of making terrorist or bomb threats to enlist in 2007, up from one the year before. The Marines did not immediately respond to request for comment. The Navy reported a slight decline in felony waivers, from 48 in 2006 to 42 in 2007. The Air Force said it granted no felony waivers in either year.

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders told CNN Sunday she supports legalizing marijuana. The trend-setting state of California is voting next month on a ballot initiative to legalize pot, also known as Proposition 19. The measure would legalize recreational use in the state, though federal officials have said they would continue to enforce drug laws in California if the initiative is approved. ""What I think is horrible about all of this, is that we criminalize young people. And we use so many of our excellent resources ... for things that aren't really causing any problems,"" said Elders. ""It's not a toxic substance."" Supporters of California's Prop. 19 say it would raise revenue and cut the cost of enforcement, while opponents point to drug's harmful side-effects. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a letter, obtained by CNN Friday, that federal agents would continue to enforce federal marijuana laws and warned Prop. 19, if passed, would be a major stumbling block to federal partnerships between state and local authorities around drug enforcement. His letter was a response to an August letter from several former directors of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration urging the White House to block Prop. 19 if it's approved next month. Elders stressed the drug is not physically addictive and pointed to the damaging impact of alcohol, which is legal. ""We have the highest number of people in the world being criminalized, many for non-violent crimes related to marijuana,"" said Elders. ""We can use our resources so much better.""","Joycelyn Elders tells CNN resources can be better spent .

"Megumi Yokota was only 13 when she was abducted by a North Korean agent in the 1970s. Now, almost 40 years after her disappearance, her aging parents, Shigeru and Sakie Yokota, have traveled to Mongolia to meet her daughter -- their granddaughter. In a series of meetings in Ulan Bator arranged by Japanese and North Korean foreign ministry officials, the Japanese couple met 26-year-old Kim Eun-gyong,  her husband and 10-month-old daughter. ""Our long-cherished dream had come true,"" Shigeru Yokota said at a press conference. ""It was actually first time to meet her although I've been seeing her on TV (since she was) 14 or 15."" Yokota, who was kidnapped from the port city of Niigata in 1977, was not present at the meeting. North Korean authorities insist that she committed suicide, although this is disputed in Japan and repatriated ashes proved not to be a DNA match. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters Monday morning that he was ""glad"" to hear that the meeting was conducted safely. ""We are determined to resolve the abduction issue at any cost,"" he said. The abductee issue is a considerable sticking point in Japan-North Korea relations. The reclusive state has admitted to kidnapping a number of Japanese nationals, mostly to help train spies in Japanese language and culture. The Yokotas said that they were unable to confirm their daughter's safety with Kim, as political matters were off the table. However, her mother said, ""I spent time with them believing Megumi is still safe somewhere.""

"Washington (CNN) -- In a move that could shake up the U.S. immigration system, the Department of Homeland Security is going to begin reviewing all 300,000 pending deportation cases in federal immigration courts to determine which individuals meet specific criteria for removal and to focus on ""our highest priorities."" DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano said the review will enhance public safety. ""Immigration judges will be able to more swiftly adjudicate high priority cases, such as those involving convicted felons,"" Napolitano wrote Thursday in a letter to assistant majority leader Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and 21 other senators including Indiana Republican Richard Lugar. In April, Durbin and Lugar sent a letter to Napolitano asking her to stop deportations of immigrant students who could earn legal status under the the DREAM Act -- legislation that would give children of illegal immigrants a path to citizenship through military service or college education. Napolitano said the Obama administration has frequently pointed out ""it makes no sense to expend our enforcement resources on low-priority cases, such as individuals... who were brought into this country as young children and know no other home."" Officials say immigration court dockets are clogged, putting public safety in jeopardy, costing money, resources and time. They want to see DHS enforcement resources diverted from illegal immigrants who don't have criminal records to individuals who pose a threat to public safety and national security. A senior administration official, who requested anonymity because details of the policy change had not yet been announced, told reporters 79% of deportations involve people without a criminal record -- people who have just entered the country illegally or had been previously deported and re-entered. Napolitano said the new policy change would not negate reforming immigration laws and ""will not alleviate the need for passage of the DREAM Act,"" which would give legal status to illegal immigrant students who attend college or join the military. She added, ""President Obama has called the DREAM Act the right thing to do for the young people it would affect, and the right thing to do for the country."" But the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which advocates changing policies to decrease the number of immigrants coming to the United States, said in a statement on its website that the action by the Obama administration ""amounts to an administrative amnesty and a sweeping overhaul of the nation's immigration policy without approval by Congress."" FAIR President Dan Stein said in the statement, ""In essence, the administration has declared that U.S. immigration is now virtually unlimited to anyone willing to try to enter and only those who commit violent felonies after arrival are subject to enforcement."" Under the new process, a DHS and the Department of Justice working group will develop specific criteria to identify low-priority removal cases that should be considered for prosecutorial discretion, including cases with minors, the elderly, pregnant and nursing women, victims of serious crimes, veterans and members of the armed services and individuals with serious disabilities or health problems. Durbin expressed support for the Obama administration announcement, saying in a written statement that it was ""the right decision"" specifically as it relates to students. ""These students are the future doctors, lawyers, teachers and maybe, senators, who will make America stronger,"" Durbin stated. ""We need to be doing all we can to keep these talented, dedicated, American students here, not wasting increasingly precious resources sending them away to countries they barely remember."" Durbin's statement added that when reviews of individual cases result in cases being closed, those individuals ""will be able to apply for certain immigration benefits, including work authorization."" Durbin's statement did not elaborate on that aspect of the policy change, beyond saying such applications for benefits would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

"In a mystery straddling two states, three men and a woman were found dead of shotgun blasts in north Alabama after two of them were targeted in a Tennessee child pornography investigation, police say. It's being called a triple murder-suicide pact, as it appears the shooter killed his sister, former brother-in-law and friend before turning the 12-gauge on himself. It's unclear why they were in Alabama and why two of the four chose to take part in the pact. The four left handwritten suicide notes claiming their innocence and making requests for their funeral arrangements. Authorities discovered the notes, along with the bodies, in a car near Double Springs, Alabama, last week, Sheriff Rick Harris in Winston County, Alabama, told CNN. The car, parked on a logging road in a national forest, had its engine running, windshield wipers on and radio blaring when deputies located it, according to CNN affiliate WATN in Memphis. Kristie Hunt Campbell Hamrick, 39; her ex-husband, Robert Samuel Hamrick, 30; her brother, Andy Hunt, 38; and family friend Kevin Carey, 30, who all listed the same Savannah, Tennessee, address as their home, were inside. In an interview with CNN affiliate WBRC in Birmingham, Harris said it appears Hunt fired five shots from a Mossberg 500A pump shotgun, killing the other three before getting into the car and shooting himself. ""We think at this point, by the shot pattern and trajectory study they did, that he walked around the car, and literally just leaned into the car and did what he had to do,"" Harris told WBRC. Campbell Hamrick and her ex-husband became targets of a pornography probe after a teenage girl made allegations in September to the Department of Children's Services, which contacted the Hardin County, Tennessee, police, said Sheriff Samuel Davidson. Deputies searched the four's mobile home the next day and seized three computer towers, two flash drives, two cameras and two cell phones, Davidson said. A forensics lab is expected to complete its analysis of the seized items next month. Next-door neighbor Danny Keymon told WATN he saw police last month take ""a bunch of junk out of here."" His neighbors later vanished, and Robert Hamrick's mother told Keymon that they'd been involved in a devastating truck accident, he said. ""We heard they had a bad 18-wheeler wreck out in rural Texas and cut both of Kristi's legs off and one of Andy's arms and one of his legs and killed Kevin and threw Robert through the windshield,"" Keymon said. Pam Dickerson, another next-door neighbor, told the station that though she'd had confrontations with Robert Hamrick in the past, he didn't seem like the type to be involved in child pornography. ""I've taken him home from town, too, when he was walking. He didn't seem like the type who could do that,"" she told WATN. No charges have been filed in the child pornography probe, and Hunt and Carey were not being investigated, Sheriff Davidson said. When police went October 3 to the Savannah trailer where the four lived, the person who answered the door told police they'd been missing for two weeks. Authorities in Alabama had discovered them the night before, Davidson said. Hardin said there will be no charges in relation to the murder-suicide, though the investigation remains open as authorities try to determine what exactly happened and why the foursome chose the Black Pond community in the William B. Bankhead National Forest to take their lives. So far, investigators know that Carey had relatives in Alabama with whom he had discussed the suicide pact. The relatives told investigators of the conversation after Carey's death, Harris told CNN. Harris also told WBRC that Carey told a friend in Hamilton, Alabama, that he and the other three planned to kill themselves rather than go to prison on child pornography charges.

"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's arrival in Tehran Saturday was marked by an incident during which a shoe was thrown by a protester in his direction, Iran's semi-official Fararu news agency said. A group of Iranian protesters, opposed to dialog with the United States, were at Tehran's airport where Rouhani supporters had also gathered to welcome the president home, Fararu said. Rouhani left the airport with his entourage without any further incident, and was accompanied by his supporters shouting, ""Rouhani, Rouhani we support you,"" according to Fararu. Rouhani, who was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, spoke by telephone Friday with U.S. President Barack Obama -- the first direct conversation between leaders in Washington and Tehran since 1979. Rouhani's recent comments have raised hopes that a deal could be struck over the Iran's controversial nuclear program. Western leaders believe the country's nuclear program is designed to produce weapons. Iranian leaders have said it is purely peaceful. Shoe throwing is seen as highly offensive in the Middle East for cultural and religious reasons.","A protester throws a shoe toward Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, media report .

"Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez vowed to press forward with his socialist reforms after winning another six-year term at the helm of the oil-rich South American country. ""Today a new cycle of the Bolivarian government begins,"" he told a crowd of cheering supporters after election results were announced. ""I promise to be a better president every day."" Chavez won more than 54% of the vote to defeat Henrique Capriles Radonski in Sunday's closely watched election. It was the fourth presidential election victory for Chavez, who has been in office since 1999. After Chavez's triumph, the answers to key questions about the South American's future were unclear: Will opposition forces lose momentum or gain strength after Sunday's defeat? Will Chavez's health affect his ability to govern? And who could succeed him within his powerful political movement? Venezuelan elections about more than Hugo Chavez's legacy . Chavez's vision of 21st century socialism emphasizes the use of state oil windfalls to fund social programs. On the campaign trail, he pointed to accomplishments in housing, education and health initiatives and acknowledged he needs to do more on crime and government bureaucracy. The ebullient leader is 58 years old and has been visibly weakened by two surgeries for cancer. He has kept secret the kind of cancer he has and his prognosis. In May, speculation intensified over who would succeed Chavez when he named 10 people to the highest circle of advisers to the president. But in July, he said he was cancer free. Share your images from the Venezuela election . Chavez's victory gives him ""the opportunity to consolidate his policies"" and also reaffirms the approach his government has taken to international relations, said Miguel Tinker Salas, a Latin American history professor at Pomona College in California. Chavez's influence over Latin America's left-leaning governments has often rankled the United States, Venezuela's largest trading partner. Venezuela is the fourth-largest exporter of oil to the United States. Despite that tight economic relationship, the two countries are far from close: Chavez often rails against the United States and its allies as ""imperialists"" and has supported controversial world leaders such as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran. The election result Sunday means the U.S. government will have to continue to deal with Chavez's provocatively independent brand of diplomacy. ""I think Washington will have to start getting used to the fact that countries in Latin America, especially South America, are charting their own course,"" said Tinker Salas. Chavez, a vocal U.S. critic . In a triumphant speech from the balcony of the presidential palace Sunday, Chavez described his election victory as ""a perfect battle, and totally democratic."" Fireworks peppered the sky over Caracas after the provisional results were announced. ""Today we have demonstrated -- comrades, compatriots -- that our democracy is one of the best in the world,"" Chavez told thousands of supporters who cheered and waved flags. He thanked those who had voted for him and acknowledged those who had voted against him, applauding their ""democratic attitude."" Observers had said Capriles, 40, represented a moderate alternative to Chavez, the charismatic standard-bearer of the Latin American left. Capriles had vowed not to end the social programs that Chavez had set up, and he had promised to fight corruption that had grown in the public sector. He appeared to have mounted one of the strongest challenges so far in Chavez's 13 years in power. But his efforts ultimately proved insufficient to unseat the incumbent. Henrique Capriles Radonski: The candidate challenging Hugo Chavez . With 90% of the ballots counted, Chavez had more than 54% of votes, with nearly 45% for Capriles, Venezuela's National Electoral Council said Sunday night. Chavez had secured 7.4 million votes and Capriles 6.1 million votes, election officials said. Capriles' supporters made a significant showing, bringing the opposition candidate the closest any presidential election opponent has come to defeating Chavez. But the high turnout wasn't enough to win for Capriles' campaign, which had criticized the Chavez administration for inefficiencies, infrastructure shortcomings and corruption. ""We began the construction of a path,"" the opposition coalition candidate told supporters after conceding his defeat. Capriles congratulated Chavez on his victory and urged him to take into account the different views expressed by voters. ""Being a good president means working for the vision of all Venezuelans,"" he said. For Venezuela's president, a year of health struggles . The opposition will now have to try to maintain a unified front for regional elections scheduled to take place in December, Tinker Salas said. That may prove difficult, he said, since ""the one thing that brought them together was the figure of Chavez."" ""There was great sadness,"" said journalist Alberto Echegaray, who watched as the results were announced at Capriles' campaign headquarters Sunday night, ""but on the other hand happiness, because we have 6 million votes in Venezuela, we have a new leader in the region who is only 40 years old, and really, we are prepared to continue forward with the proposal we have."" The country saw one of its high participation rates in decades Sunday, with almost 81% of voters going to the polls, according to Tibisay Lucena, president of the National Electoral Council. In fact, some polling places were kept open two hours after their scheduled closing because of lines of voters waiting for ballots. Nearly 140,000 troops were deployed throughout the country to guard polling places and keep the peace, state-run VTV reported.

"(CNN) -- NFL player representatives and the league's owners on Monday signed a collective-bargaining agreement to end a lockout that threatened to derail the 2011 season. ""Football's back!"" NFL Roger Goodell exclaimed at a news conference in Washington after the agreement was signed, ending the four-month lockout. He said the 10-year agreement ""is extraordinarily great for our game."" The agreement was signed after members of the NFL Players Association unanimously approved the deal offered by the league's 32 owners early Monday. Chief among the issues embraced in the deal was the main issue of the lockout -- how to divide the $9 billion the NFL takes in each year. Under the old agreement, NFL owners took $1 billion off the top of that revenue stream. After that, the players got about 60%. The owners said the old labor deal didn't take into account the rising costs related to building stadiums and promoting the game. The players argued that the league had not sufficiently opened up its books to prove this. ""We managed to talk about things that make football better and safer,"" NFLPA Executive Director DeMaurice Smith told reporters on Monday. ""There are a number of issues that (needed) to be considered. ... The good thing is, the only way to talk about these things is if you're a union."" The compensation issue was resolved when both side embraced an ""all revenue system"" as the basis for player compensation, according to an NFLPA news release. Under the system, the floor for the players' share of the revenue is set at 47%. The deal sets the salary cap at about $120.4 million per club -- plus $22 million in benefits for performance-based pay in 2011. This includes a guarantee for the league as a whole to spend no less than 99% of the cap in 2011 and 2012, and no less than 95% in consecutive four-year periods thereafter. Both sides over the weekend discussed details that players wanted resolved, including the contractual handling of player injury, an opt-out clause in the 10-year deal and, ""most pointedly, the potential timeline for the recertification of the NFLPA (NFL Players' Association) as a union,"" the NFL said. In a bid to reduce injuries, the pact eliminated ""two-a-day"" practices, set a maximum of 4.5 hours on-field per day during training camp, and limited full-contact practices to an average of one per week not exceeding three hours. It also allows for unannounced inspections by NFLPA staff to ensure compliance. It also limits off-season workout requirements. Player representative Jeff Saturday acknowledged that the lockout ""has been (a) roller coaster for the fans,"" but he echoed the cheerfulness from both sides: ""With dialogue, things began to happen,"" said Saturday, a center for the Indianapolis Colts, ""and ...now instead of these meeting rooms, I get to be in football meeting rooms (at training camp)."" With the signing of the deal, the clock begins to roll on the 2011 season, beginning with the league's publication of its free agency list. The rest of the week will be dominated by the deferred business of expanding rosters, signing drafted rookies, reopening facilities and starting camps in preparation for preseason games, the first of which are on August 11, according to an updated league schedule released Monday. The only confirmed casualty of the lockout is the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, which was canceled because of the delay in opening camps, Goodell said. The game, which this year was to be between the St. Louis Rams and Chicago Bears, had been scheduled for August 7. The regular season is set to open on September 8. The league's owners imposed the lockout on March 11, suspending the labor deal in place at the time in hopes of creating a new financial structure. Ten players, including marquee quarterbacks Drew Brees, Tom Brady and Peyton Manning, subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the league on behalf of other current and eligible NFL athletes. A judge in early April joined that action with another filed by retired players. After the lockout, the two sides faced off in courts and around conference tables. The issues revolved around how to divide the billions of dollars of revenue reaped via the league each year, rules of free agency, the rookie wage scale, retirement benefits and a host of other matters. According to the NFLPA, the deal, among other things: . -- Raises the minimum salary by $55,000 a year from 2010, with increases each year through 2014 By that year, the NFL's lowest salary will be $420,000. -- Sets the overall limit on rookie compensation at $874 million in 2011 (increasing with salary cap); . -- Sets minimum pay for high draft picks at a graduated scale based on average pay of the highest-paid players at those positions; . -- Sets mandatory contracts lengths at four years for players drafted in the first seven rounds; . -- Guarantees contracts against injury for up to three years; . -- Creates a $610 million Legacy Fund for players who played before the 1993 season; . -- Allows the NFLPA discretionary use of $20 million per year for health, safety and ""former player issues;"" -- Calls for a three-member appeals panel, including at least one former judge, to resolve disputes.","""All revenue system"" resolves issue of how to split NFL's $9 billion take .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Marine Lance Cpl. Joshua Bleill lost both his legs above the knees when a bomb exploded under his Humvee while on patrol in Iraq on October 15, 2006. He has 32 pins in his hip and a 6-inch screw holding his pelvis together. Joshua Bleill, pictured here with his girlfriend, is walking again with the aid of prosthetics outfitted with Bluetooth. Now, he's starting to walk again with the help of prosthetic legs outfitted with Bluetooth technology more commonly associated with hands-free cell phones. ""They're the latest and greatest,"" Bleill said, referring to his groundbreaking artificial legs. Bleill, 30, is one of two Iraq war veterans, both double leg amputees, to use the Bluetooth prosthetics. Computer chips in each leg send signals to motors in the artificial joints so the knees and ankles move in a coordinated fashion. Bleill's set of prosthetics have Bluetooth receivers strapped to the ankle area. The Bluetooth device on each leg tells the other leg what it's doing, how it's moving, whether walking, standing or climbing steps, for example. ""They mimic each other, so for stride length, for amount of force coming up, going uphill, downhill and such, they can vary speed and then to stop them again,"" Bleill told CNN from Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where he's undergoing rehab. ""I will put resistance with my own thigh muscles to slow them down, so I can stop walking, which is always nice.""  Watch Bleill demonstrate his legs » . Bluetooth is the name for short-range wireless technology that can connect computers to printers, MP3 players to speakers and -- perhaps the most well-known use -- cell phones to ear pieces. Older models of computer-controlled legs have to be ""programmed"" via wire by laptop computers before the amputee can use them. Those legs required more movement from the amputee's remaining thigh muscle to generate motion in the prosthetic leg. Because of built-in motors, the Bluetooth legs allow Bleill to walk longer before he tires. ""We've compared walking several laps in both sets of legs and one, your legs come out burning and tired and these, you know, you sometimes are not even breaking a sweat yet."" Bleill says the technology also means he spends less time in a wheelchair. The Marine uses canes to walk with them. He's hoping to get to the point where he can use one cane regularly, and eventually lose the cane altogether. ""I can walk without canes, but it's not real pretty,"" he said. This new generation of prosthetic technology was originally conceived to help amputees who had lost only one leg. But it's working for Bleill and Army Lt.Col. Gregory Gadson, who is also using the Bluetooth devices in his legs. What they are experiencing will help future amputees. ""We are the first ever to try this, so it's learning day-to-day. The [prosthetics] company comes down on a regular basis and checks in with us,"" Bleill said. Gadson, a former linebacker at West Point, said they are breaking new ground for amputees. ""I think we are kind of pioneering and hopefully blazing a trail for others to try the technology also,"" he said. But the technology is not without some problems. ""It's only going to react to how I move,"" Bleill said. ""Unfortunately, sometimes I don't know those reactions, I don't know what I'm doing to make it react. So sometimes the leg kicks harder than I want it to, or farther, and then I start perpetuating, and I start moving faster than I really want to."" Aside from the Bluetooth technology, Bleill's legs have one other thing in common with a cell phone. They need to be charged overnight. Currently, there are no spare batteries available. What are his long-range plans? He just wants to make it back to his home state of Indiana and work for a charity or even help the NFL's Indianapolis Colts. ""They do a lot for the community,"" he said. He added he simply wants ""to give back."" ""To, you know, just carry on a normal life. Go home, see my girlfriend, see my family.""

"Mohammed Merah was the sort of radicalized individual who makes Western counterterrorism officials very apprehensive: someone who was determined, trained, living legally in Europe or the United States and operating alone. One of dozens (perhaps hundreds) of militants either unknown to authorities or suspected of plotting a terrorist attack but whose real intentions and movements are difficult to track. Merah was shot dead at the end of a lengthy siege on Thursday; he had been hunted by police in connection with the killings of seven people in the past 10 days. He had twice visited the Afghan-Pakistan border area, in 2010 and 2011, French officials said Wednesday. And after the standoff began in Toulouse, he claimed to have been trained by al Qaeda, they say. Suspect holds police at bay . Paris prosecutor François Molins said Wednesday, ""He has traveled to Afghanistan without using the networks known by French and foreign intelligence services, which means he went there by his own means and without going through facilitators known by intelligences services, and without going through countries usually monitored."" But Merah had appeared on the security services' radar, according to Molins. During his first trip to Afghanistan, ""Afghan police checked his ID during a traffic stop, and as a result he was handed over to the U.S. Army, who then put him on board the first plane heading to France,"" Molins said. (A senior U.S. official gave a different account, saying Afghan forces had actually handed him over to French troops, who had him repatriated.) Merah had been under surveillance by French intelligence for years, according to Interior Minister Claude Gueant. Even so, he was apparently able to visit the Afghan-Pakistan region a second time and then accumulate weapons after returning home, including an Uzi machine pistol and an assault rifle, plan a series of attacks in Toulouse and Montauban, and force the French government to step up security precautions nationwide. The jihadist trail . French authorities believe that between 20 and 30 French nationals are tied to jihadist groups in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area. However, one French intelligence estimate in 2010 put the potential number as high as 200 or 250. In 2008, a group of militants traveled from France to Pakistan's tribal areas, where they joined al Qaeda, including Hamza el Alami, a French citizen of Moroccan descent. Alami was killed in fighting in the border region. Who is Mohammed Merah? In fall 2010, another militant returning from the region and suspected of meeting with al Qaeda operatives was arrested on suspicion of plotting a terrorist attack in France. France's growing Pakistani diaspora has added to concerns about travel flows to Pakistan. French intelligence services have invested heavily in keeping tabs on nationals who have made the trip recently. In April 2011, two French nationals were arrested in Lahore, Pakistan, after meeting with Umar Patek, an Indonesian al Qaeda-linked operative. The two -- one of whom was of Pakistani descent, and one of whom was a convert to Islam -- met Patek so he could transport them for training in North Waziristan, according to Pakistani intelligence officials. Radicalization in Europe . What is unclear is when and how Merah was radicalized, whether online or through membership of a radical Islamist group in Europe. Gueant said Wednesday that Merah became radicalized amid a small salafist group in Toulouse and had connections to a group called Forsane Alizza (""Knights of Pride""). But there is no evidence that any of its members was involved in or aware of his plans. Forsane Alizza was outlawed in January by the French government, which alleged that it was a terrorist organization training members ""for armed combat."" For its part, the group said its mission was to fight Islamophobia and has said it will contest the government's decision. But its website used militant language such as calling for ""soldiers"" to defend Muslim women. And while there is no evidence that Forsane Alizza  has been involved in acts of violence, it has certainly promoted the threatening rhetoric of others, glorifying Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed last year. One member suggested that the right-wing Swiss politician Oskar Freysinger deserved a ""bullet in the forehead."" Freysinger has campaigned against permitting minarets on mosques in Switzerland. Forsane Alizza also seems to be tied to a group called the Force de Défense Musulmane sur Internet, which campaigns to have Islamophobic material removed from websites. Forsane Alizza appears to have been strongest in Paris and the central French city of Limoges, where several of its members were arrested in 2010 after invading a McDonald's restaurant and shouting anti-Semitic slogans. The group has also protested a French law banning women from wearing a full veil in public places and posted a number of well-produced videos of its protests in French cities. Its outlook appears very similar to other radical Islamist groups in Europe, such as Islam4UK in Britain and Shariah4Belgium, as well as Revolution Muslim in the United States.  Videos purportedly produced jointly by Shariah4Belgium and Forsane Alizza have been uploaded to YouTube in the past month. Islamic radicalization increased in France in the 2000s, fueled by growing militancy in social media, the role of French troops in Afghanistan, and the Palestinian issue.  Bleak socioeconomic prospects in the suburbs of French cities where many French Muslims of North African descent live, the rise of the far right in France and the government's ban on the niqab (full veil) has added to the sense of grievance felt by some young French Muslims. Unlike in the United States or Britain, French laws restricted the ability of French radical groups to freely proselytize, but according to some analysts, the lack of a public pressure valve may have itself been dangerous. Before his death, Osama bin Laden tried to tap into the grievances of Muslims living in France. In an October 2010 audio recording attributed to bin Laden, he attacked the French ban on the niqab. ""The equation is very clear and simple: As you kill, you will be killed; as you take others hostages, you will be taken hostages; as you waste our security, we will ... waste your security,"" bin Laden said. That message, and similar audio and video postings from the likes of Awlaki, resonate with a fringe of marginalized young Muslim men living in the poorer quartiers of French cities, with little prospect of work and regular confrontations with police. According to French officials, Merah had a series of convictions for petty crime and had been turned down for army service. Al Qaeda changing gears . Al Qaeda propaganda and recruitment efforts have shifted emphasis in recent years, from spectacular attacks on the scale of 9/11 to ""do-it-yourself"" attacks that require less training and planning. In June 2011, the group's media production arm As Sahab released a video titled ""You Are Only Responsible for Yourself,"" encouraging followers to carry out acts of individual terrorism in the West. In the recording, Oregon-born al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn said it was easy for American al Qaeda sympathizers to go to a gun show and purchase an automatic assault rifle without having to submit to a background check. Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch has been especially vocal in encouraging lone acts of terrorism. Its English-language magazine Inspire has a section dedicated to helping terrorist sympathizers in the West carry out attacks, including bomb-making recipes. According to authorities, one such formula, ""How to Make a Bomb in Your Mom's Kitchen,"" has been downloaded by individuals plotting terrorist attacks in both the U.S. and the UK.","France shooting suspect was type of person who worries counterterror officials .

"Dennis Rodman is apologizing. Again. Last week, he said he was sorry about his bizarre, drunken outburst on CNN about an American citizen held prisoner in North Korea. Now, Rodman says he's sorry about what's going on inside North Korea, a nation renowned for its human rights abuses. But the eccentric former NBA star known as ""The Worm"" isn't contrite about his latest puzzling visit to the secretive state. He said he did nothing wrong by organizing a basketball game last week at a packed stadium in Pyongyang, an event at which he sang ""Happy Birthday"" to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""I'm sorry for what's going on in North Korea, the certain situations,"" Rodman told CNN on Monday after arriving at Beijing International Airport from Pyongyang. He didn't say exactly what those ""situations"" are. He may have been referring to the reports of horrific human rights abuses by his friend Kim's regime, or to the estimated 200,000 people kept in political prison camps. Or maybe he was talking about Kenneth Bae, the U.S. citizen sentenced last year to 15 years of hard labor by North Korea on accusations that he planned to bring down the government through religious activities. He was certainly less boisterous than when he spoke to CNN's Chris Cuomo last week. In that interview, he appeared to suggest that Bae may have done something to deserve his heavy sentence. After his on-air rant drew criticism from Bae's family and others, Rodman apologized, saying he'd been drinking and was under stress. In Beijing on Monday, returning from a week-long visit to North Korea, he struck a more humble tone. ""I'm not God, I'm not (an) ambassador, I'm no one,"" he said. ""I just want to show the world the fact that we can actually get along in sport. That is it!"" Rodman later flew back to the United States, landing at Newark, New Jersey, Monday evening. He left the airport there without talking to reporters. 'I love America' Rodman has described Kim, whose once-powerful uncle was recently purged and executed, as a friend and a ""very good guy."" He said he was happy that by playing basketball with and in front of North Koreans -- an approach dubbed ""basketball diplomacy"" -- he and the other former NBA players who accompanied him had tried to ""do something good for the world."" But Rodman said he was sad that ""everyone is trying to break this down, to push it on me."" ""I don't know why,"" he said. ""I haven't done anything wrong. Nothing wrong!"" Some observers have said Rodman's ""basketball diplomacy"" may have positive effects in North Korea by offering the people there a different view of the West, compared with its demonic portrayal in the country's tightly controlled state media. But others, including human rights activists, say it's an embarrassing media sideshow that distracts attention from the North Korean regime's brutality. Rodman rejected suggestions that he had betrayed his country by befriending Kim, a dictator whose regime's rhetoric describes the United States as a mortal enemy. ""I love America. I love my country."" he said. ""I'd never damage my country."" Caught in the middle . Retired NBA player Cliff Robinson, who went on the trip, said Monday on CNN's ""New Day"" that he was surprised by the backlash the trip generated back home and was unaware the game would coincide with Kim's birthday. But he was apprehensive about criticizing Rodman. ""Dennis is a great guy. Dennis is going to be Dennis,"" he said. ""I don't want to sit here and ever put someone that I've supported and throw them under the bus. We're grown men."" Robinson said he and the other players ""could have probably done a little more homework as to what was going on, or ask Dennis questions."" Another member of Rodman's team, Kenny Anderson, agreed. ""I didn't do my due diligence,"" Anderson told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live,"" saying he didn't know anything about the political situation in North Korea. Anderson, a star player for the New Jersey Nets in the 1990s, said he now felt ""very bad"" about the North Korea trip. He said his children got ""approached"" at school about his participation in the visit. The money question . Last week, NBA Commissioner David Stern said the former NBA players were ""blinded by the payday,"" but the players have been adamant that North Korea did not pay them. ""Absolutely not. I think I am astute enough to understand the dynamics, especially collecting monetary dollars from North Korea. No, we did not get paid from North Korea at all,"" Rodman teammate Charles Smith told CNN in a lengthy exclusive interview on ""New Day Sunday."" Smith, who retired from the NBA in 1997 after nine seasons, said an Irish online betting company and a documentary film crew paid expenses for the ex-players turned hoops ambassadors. Last month, the Irish company Paddy Power said it had removed its name from Rodman's project after the execution of Kim's uncle and top aide, Jang Song Thaek. But it said it would honor its ""contractual commitments"" to the team. Anderson said different players were paid different amounts for their participation. He said he received ""a few thousand dollars"" but less than $10,000. Pressed by Morgan, he said he would give ""a portion"" of his fee to charity. But he refused to commit to give it all away. Rodman under pressure . Speaking by satellite from Beijing at the weekend, Smith said it wasn't about the money. He saw it as an opportunity to go to a reclusive country and exchange cultural information with other athletes and citizens. But he didn't see it as a birthday present for Kim. ""That's the date that was set. I didn't know it was his birthday,"" he said in the half-hour interview. ""And it didn't matter to me once I found out that it was his birthday.""

"A mother's plea to the terrorists holding her son hostage: No individual should be punished for events he cannot control. The mother is Shirley Sotloff, and she speaks directly to ISIS leader  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a video broadcast Wednesday on Al Arabiya Network. Her son, freelance journalist Steven Sotloff, appeared last week in an ISIS video showing the decapitation of American journalist James Foley. The militant in the video warns that Steven Sotloff's fate depends on what President Barack Obama does next in Iraq. A day after the video was posted, Obama vowed that the United States would be ""relentless"" in striking back against ISIS. ""Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson,"" Shirley Sotloff said in the rare public appeal. ""He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak."" The journalist has no control over what the United States government does, and he should not be held responsible for its actions, she says. ""He's an innocent journalist,"" she said. Friends of ISIS captive Sotloff speak out admiringly of his talent, passion . The mother appeals to al-Baghdadi's self-declared title of caliph of the Islamic State. As caliph, he has the power to grant amnesty to Steven Sotloff, the mother said. ""I ask you to please release my child,"" she said. Steven Sotloff disappeared while reporting from Syria in August 2013, but his family kept the news secret, fearing harm to him if they went public. Out of public view, the family and a number of government agencies have been trying to gain Sotloff's release for the past year. Sotloff, 31, grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. He majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians like the Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Miles Davis and movies like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" as favorites. On his Twitter page, he playfully identifies himself as a ""stand-up philosopher from Miami."" In 2004, Sotloff left UCF and moved back to the Miami area. He graduated from another college, began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications, including Time, Foreign Policy, World Affairs and the Christian Science Monitor. His travels took him to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey -- among other countries -- and eventually Syria. The following is the full text of Shirley Sotloff's video statement: . I'm sending this message to you, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ... the caliph of the Islamic State. I am Shirley Sotloff. My son, Steven, is in your hands. Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson. He's an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak. We've not seen Stephen for over a year, and we miss him very much.  We want to see him home safe and sound and to hug him. Since Stephen's capture, I've learned a lot about Islam. I've learned that Islam teaches that no individual should be held responsible for the sins of others. Stephen has no control over the actions of the U.S. government. He's an innocent journalist. I've always learned that you, the caliph, can grant amnesty. I ask you to please release my child.  As a mother, I ask your justice to be merciful and not punish my son for matters he has no control over. I ask you to use your authority to spare his life and to set the example of the Prophet Mohammed, who protected people of the Book. I want what every mother wants: to live to see her children's children. I plead with you to grant me this.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian lawmakers denounced Monday's protests in Tehran and called for the execution of two opposition leaders for inciting the demonstrations, Iran's state-run Press TV reported Tuesday. Members of the Iranian parliament issued fiery chants against opposition leaders and former presidential candidates Mehdi Karrubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi. Press TV aired video Tuesday of lawmakers chanting ""Moussavi, Karrubi ... execute them."" Lawmakers also named former President Mohammad Khatami in some of the death chants. The calls for the leaders' executions come after a particularly deadly month in Iran. At least 66 people were executed in January, according to Iranian media reports. Most of the executions were reportedly carried out for drug offenses, although at least three involved political prisoners, a U.N. statement said. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay expressed alarm earlier this month over the number of executions. Iranian leaders have praised Egypt's revolution, but Monday when protesters in Iran took to the streets the government cracked down hard. Last week, the Iranian government rounded up activists after Karrubi and Moussavi called for supporters to gather at Azadi Square -- the site of mass protests by Iran's opposition movement after the disputed 2009 presidential elections. Despite the security crackdown, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched in Tehran Monday. Patrolling security forces battled protesters with batons and tear gas for much of the day. The massive crowd was largely cleared from the city's streets by nightfall and the main squares near Tehran University remained free of police, security forces or protesters. Dozens of demonstrators were detained during Monday's protests, while videos posted on the showed others had been chased and beaten. One person was shot and killed during the protests, according to Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency. Several others were injured and listed in serious condition as a result of the shooting, which the Iranian government blamed on ""agitators and seditionists."" The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that nine security force members were among those injured in the protests, which the country's deputy police chief called ""illegal gatherings ... directed from America, England and Israel."" ""The hands of sedition leaders are drenched in blood and they should answer for these actions,"" Ahmad Reza Radan said, according to IRNA. Video uploaded to YouTube showed throngs of demonstrators marching, burning posters of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and in one instance beating a man who appeared to try to remove a poster from the hands of protesters. Other YouTube video showed police in riot gear pursuing dozens of people running away from the baton-wielding officers. Other videos show similar protests going on in other cities in Iran such as Shiraz and Isfahan. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos and witnesses declined to be named for fear of retribution. Reporting from Iran proved extremely difficult Monday -- foreign journalists were denied visas, accredited journalists living in the country were restricted from covering the demonstrations and internet speeds slowed to a crawl in an apparent attempt to both limit protest organizing and restrict information from being transmitted out of the country. Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, released a statement Tuesday urging Iranian officials to ""fully respect and protect the rights of their citizens, including freedom of expression and the right to assemble peacefully.""

"The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer shows the U.S. is making progress in controlling some tumors, but rates of human papillomavirus-related cancers remain stubbornly high. Overall, the report shows lower cancer rates in the U.S. among all genders and racial and ethnic groups for the most common cancers, including lung, colon, anal, breast and prostate. But rates of HPV-related cancers, like cervical cancer, are elevated despite the fact that a vaccine exists to prevent the viral infection that can trigger the disease. ""It's hard not to be happy that the death rates of these major cancers are going down, but I think the HPV issue is pressing. If you can't get individuals to get vaccinated because getting cancer is horrible, then there has to be an economic side to this because treating people with these cancers is expensive,"" says Dr. Joanne Mortimer, director of the Women's Cancer Program at the City of Hope cancer center in Los Angeles. ""I think the biggest challenge we face is figuring out a way to vaccinate individuals to prevent this."" TIME.com: Study hints at potential increased risk of cancer among 9/11 rescue workers . The Food and Drug Administration approved the first vaccine against a cancer, Gardasil, which protects against the HPV strains that can trigger cervical cancer and genital warts, in 2006. Shortly after approval, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which sets immunization guidelines, added the HPV vaccine to its lineup of recommended childhood vaccinations, proposing that girls ages 11 to 12 be immunized against the sexually transmitted HPV before they became sexually active. State health departments, which follow CDC guidelines, began mandating the shot for school entry, but parents balked. The so-called promiscuity vaccine, as they saw it, would only promote sexual activity and many refused to vaccinate their preteen children for a sexually transmitted disease. (Research shows that's not case.) In 2010, only 48.7% of girls ages 13 through 17 received at least one dose of the three-dose HPV vaccine (Cervarix joined Gardasil as the second HPV vaccine in 2009), and only 32% received all three recommended doses. Considering the U.S. government's Healthy People 2020 target is 80% vaccination among girls ages 13 to 15 for all three doses, those immunization rates are lagging. Comparatively, vaccination rates are much higher in Canada, the U.K. and Australia. The shots are effective at controlling the most common strains responsible for cervical cancer, and public-health officials still see the vaccine as a powerful weapon in keeping rates of this cancer down. Between 2000 and '09, rates of HPV-associated cancers declined in all women except American Indians and Alaska Natives, among whom vaccination rates are lower. TIME.com: An experimental cervical cancer vaccine shows promise . And the benefits of the anticancer vaccine aren't limited to girls. The same virus that contributes to cervical cancer can also lead to anal and oral cancers, which is why the CDC also recommends the shot for boys ages 11 to 12 years as well. ""It's not unique to certain populations, and HPV infections are now across all demographics, and that is one reason we are seeing more anal cancers,"" says Dr. Julian Sanchez, a colorectal-cancer surgeon at City of Hope. ""It's not a topic that's in the media very often."" That frustrates cancer experts and public-health officials since the HPV-related cancers are among the most preventable, with proper vaccination. But misconceptions about the vaccine and its potential side effects — former presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann erroneously linked HPV to mental retardation — and parental resistance to inoculating young children against a sexually transmitted virus make HPV vaccination a ""taboo"" topic for many doctors. But that's a hurdle that health providers have to overcome, say cancer experts, if they want to see the encouraging declines in cancer continue. ""Just as it is hard for some patients to talk about anal disease or their kids having sex, it's equally hard for some providers to talk about it,"" says Sanchez. ""I talk about it every day, and sometimes it is still difficult for me to approach some patients who I know have a degree of opposition to this type of conversation."" TIME.com: Gardasil: No serious health concerns linked with HPV vaccine . The annual report is a collaboration between researchers at the CDC, the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Since 1998, it has provided a robust picture of the state of cancer in the U.S. Unlike the case with HPV-related cancers, the report shows that from 2000 to '09, cancer-death rates overall have been declining, dropping by 1.8% per year among men, 1.4% among women and 1.8% among kids up to the age of 14. For both men and women, the declines occurred among some of the most common cancers: lung, prostate, breast, colon and rectum, leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The cancers with rising death rates included skin, pancreatic and liver cancers for men, while women showed an elevated risk of dying from pancreatic, liver cancer and uterine cancers. TIME.com: Cancer and foggy thinking: Is chemotherapy really the cause? The rates of new cancers in the same time period showed a more varied pattern. While men enjoyed an overall 0.6% decrease per year on average of new diagnoses, the rates for women remained stable, while children showed a 0.6% increase per year of new cancer cases. The decline for men was driven by fewer cases of prostate, lung, rectum, stomach and larynx cancers; women showed some of the same drops, but these were offset by increases in thyroid, melanoma, kidney, pancreas, leukemia, liver and uterine cancers. ""Every time we get these reports we argue about whether the death rate decreases because we find so many of these cancers early and we overtreat certain cancers like breast cancer and prostate cancer,"" says Mortimer. Overscreening and overtreating cancers have recently become a controversial public-health topic as new analyses question the extensive and repeated screening for certain cancers, like breast and prostate, in light of their potential complications and costs. In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force changed its recommendations for mammograms, advising women to wait until they are 50 years old, not 40, to begin regular testing. In 2012, the task force also advised men to skip routine screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific-antigen test altogether unless they have a history of the disease. TIME.com: Government panel recommends HPV vaccine for boys . Experts hope that the good and bad news in the report will motivate Americans to remain vigilant about cancer's risk factors, including smoking and too much sun exposure, while taking advantage of ways to protect themselves from tumors, like getting vaccinated against HPV. ""The report does a great job of raising this awareness to the public, showing that we are doing our job. But we still have more to do. Just as in other diseases where vaccination has eradicated some, we can still make strides in this disease as well,"" says Sanchez. This story was originally published on TIME.com.

"Japan on Friday eased several of its sanctions on North Korea after the two countries made progress this week in talks about Japanese citizens kidnapped by the North Korean regime during the Cold War. The sanctions the Japanese government is lifting or softening include an entry ban on North Korean citizens, an embargo on North Korean ships in Japanese ports and a requirement for reporting movements of money to North Korea. Tokyo is easing some of its unilateral sanctions, but it's sticking to the multilateral ones set out in U.N. resolutions. Japan's move came after the regime in Pyongyang agreed this week to reopen investigations into the decades-old cases of the kidnap victims following talks between the two sides in Beijing. According to the Japanese government, North Korean operatives abducted at least 17 Japanese people in the late 1970s and early 1980s, possibly dozens more. Special committee . In 2002, North Korea admitted to the kidnappings for the first time but allowed only five abduction victims to return home to Japan. Information on the remaining 12 was sketchy at best. Some were kidnapped alone, while walking to and from school. Others were taken in pairs while out on dates, including a couple snatched from the beach after walking to see the sunset. North Korea is setting up a ""Special Investigative Committee,"" the country's state-run Korean Central News Agency reported Friday. The committee of about 30 officials will look into the cases of ""all Japanese"" residing in North Korea, the report said, with different panels for abducted Japanese, missing Japanese and Japanese people's remains. Visits, ships and money . Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had announced plans to ease the sanctions Thursday. He said such a move would be ""only a start,"" and that he would aim for a ""complete resolution"" of the issue. His government said Friday that it would remove the entry ban on North Korean citizens and partially lift the embargo on North Korean-flagged ships, allowing those on ""humanitarian"" missions to dock in Japanese ports. It also raised the threshold at which money moved into North Korea has to be reported: from 100,000 yen (about $1,000) to 1 million yen for cash, and from 3 million yen to 30 million yen for money transfers. The government also removed a restriction that asked Japanese citizens to voluntarily not travel to North Korea, a measure that had stymied the organization of commercial tours to the country. U.S. supportive . The United States has so far expressed support for Japan's efforts to resolve the abductions issue in a transparent way, saying it's in close contact with Tokyo on the matter. South Korea has said it ""looks forward to an early resolution on humanitarian grounds"" of the kidnapping cases, stressing that the process should not undermine efforts to put pressure on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. The families of the kidnapped Japanese citizens, meanwhile, are waiting to see whether the diplomatic maneuvers will bring them any answers about what happened to their missing relatives.","Affected sanctions include an entry ban on N.

"Athens, Georgia (CNN) -- The still charred brick walls reverberated with music for the first time since a 2009 fire gutted the iconic Georgia Theatre. The historic venue, though rebuilt and modernized, still showed the scars of the blaze that almost devoured the entire building. The Glands, an indie rock band from Athens, Georgia, began their sound check in the same spot that helped launch the careers of R.E.M., the B-52s and many other influential groups. ""That's the first song that's been played in here in two years,"" said owner Wilmot Greene, a smile beaming from his face now that construction was complete and the music had returned. After two years of working to the sounds of backhoes and jackhammers, Greene hears rock 'n' roll. There were major doubts about whether the musical landmark would come back after the fire. But on August 1 the theatre opened its doors to ticket holders for a triumphant two-week series of performances. Greene said he will never forget the reopening. ""It was just such a magical night to finally see people back in here."" The still-unexplained fire ignited overnight inside a guest dressing room and fully engulfed the building's mostly wooden interior. In just a few hours the blaze destroyed the interior of the more than 100-year-old building. August 2010: Theater struggles after fire . The final cost to rebuild the theater and retrofit it to modern building codes: $4.5 million. Insurance only covered what little was owed on the original structure and the owners were limited by how much they could borrow from the bank. Donations and fundraising benefits have brought in more than $250,000. The largest donation came from the Grammy Award winning Zac Brown Band, another product of the Athens music scene. Without these contributions, the theater might not have been brought back to life. ""We raised exactly as much as we had to. Had we raised any less it wouldn't have worked,"" said Greene. The theater continues to accept donations and high-level donors are honored in a photo gallery inside the theater that documents the fire and rebuilding process. The new space has been transformed from four blackened exterior brick walls and a heap of smoldering rubble to what theater production manager Ric Wallace describes as a world class music venue. ""Everything is designed to operate and support A-list artists,"" he said. The Drive-By Truckers' guitarist and singer Patterson Hood was heartbroken when he got the call that the theater had burned down. ""It's a very important part of our town's music history,"" Hood said. ""We were all very upset."" He was pleased with how much the re-build matches the original grandeur. ""I think they did an absolutely fantastic job with it,"" he said. ""I was blown away!"" The rickety wooden steps that at one point led patrons to the balcony have been replaced with an elevator and three floors of a fire-safe enclosed spiral staircase. The worn and tattered bars have been rebuilt using wood salvaged from the rubble. And the new 65,000 watt sound system fills the room completely to ensure the 1,087 fans get what they came for, the music. Though the insides have changed, the remodeled structure still pays homage to the original. The signature marquee remains. There are still two bars that flank either side on the main level. Stately red curtains still outline the stage and the same exposed brick walls, though more charred than before, are all still there. Starting with a blank slate also gave theater management the ability to make improvements. A three-tiered balcony gives a great vantage point to see the shows and a rooftop bar allows concertgoers the opportunity to step outside and soak in the evening. The remodelers' ultimate goal, though, was to give the theater an updated look without taking away from the feel of the original layout. ""Even though it's a different place, it's still the same, it's still the grand old theater,"" Wallace said. The building was transformed into a movie theater in the 1930s and has been everything from a YMCA to a Masonic temple to a furniture store. It became a music venue in 1978 and was the backdrop for R.E.M.'s ""Shiny Happy People"" and John Mayer's ""No Such Thing"" videos. Other major artists, such as Widespread Panic and Zac Brown, cut their teeth playing to sweaty fans inside the theatre. It became the type of venue that gave something to everybody. With so many shows that span several genres, any music fan can find their niche. On one night, the Derek Trucks Band would jam on mellow Southern blues. Another night, Cee Lo Green would blow the roof off with R&B. With this in mind, the owners decided to hold the two-week grand opening to cover the full gamut of musical styles that fully encapsulates the diversity of the theater. ""What I've always loved about the Georgia Theatre is that it's a clean palette that any kind of artist can paint on,"" said Greene. Drive-By Truckers were among a dozen acts who performed during the grand reopening. Others included Big Boi and Bela Fleck and the Flecktones. ""It has been fabulous, "" Greene said of the first weeks of shows. ""The crowds have been full and the bands have been happy. It's really just gone fantastic!"" The fans have come back in droves, selling out most shows since the reopening. The theatre is now able to resume its purpose: giving people a place to just enjoy the music. ""There's this real primeval thing about going to a concert,"" Greene said. ""I feel like people have been dancing around the fire since we were humans."" Now, after two years and a massive effort, the dancing has returned.","Burned in mysterious '09 fire, venue holds grand re-opening .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- NASA announced Tuesday the new retirement homes for the four remaining space shuttles -- three historic orbiters and the program's test vehicle. The space shuttle Atlantis will be displayed at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida; the Endeavour, at the California Science Center in Los Angeles; the Discovery, at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia; and the test shuttle, Enterprise, at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York, NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden Jr. said during a ceremony at the Kennedy Center. The announcement was made on the 30th anniversary of the space shuttle program's first flight, made by the subsequently ill-fated Columbia orbiter, and the 50th anniversary of Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin becoming the first human in space. More than 20 locations around the country sought one of the orbiters because of the potential tourist draw. The drama mirrored the bidding to host an Olympic games. Supporters of sites that were rejected expressed disappointment. U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said the Johnson Space Center in Houston should have been one of the retirement homes for an orbiter, ""but it is clear political favors trumped common sense and fairness in the selection of the final locations for the orbiter fleet,"" he said in a statement. He noted that Houston ""played a critical role throughout the life of the space shuttle."" ""Like many Texans, I am disappointed with NASA's decision to slight the Johnson Space Center as a permanent home for one of the space shuttle orbiters,"" Cornyn said. ""There is no question Houston should have been selected as a final home for one of the orbiters -- even Administrator Bolden stated as much. Today's announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at Johnson Space Center, the greater Houston community and the state of Texas, and I'm deeply disappointed with the administration's misguided decision,"" Cornyn said. In Los Angeles, shortly after NASA's announcement, California Science Center President Jeffrey Rudolph told reporters that the Endeavour would boost the center's annual 1.4 million visitors to about 2 million people a year. The center plans to use the orbiter as the centerpiece to a new air and space gallery, which would cost $200 million and is part of the center's 25-year master plan, Rudolph said. That price tag includes the $28.8 million that the center must pay NASA to prepare and relocate the orbiter to Los Angeles, he said. The center hasn't hired an architect yet to design the new facility and is now planning a fundraiser, he said. ""Obviously, we were thrilled. We got the word this morning, shortly before the announcement,"" Rudolph said of his reaction to winning one of the shuttles. ""The fact that the shuttle was created here in California had a lot to do with giving us a leg up"" over the competition, Rudolph said. ""It's a fitting place for this national treasure."" The center, which also features a Los Angeles charter school, is the most attended museum in southern California and one of the most attended in the country, Rudolph said. The Los Angeles center's existing air and space gallery is now home to the Mercury-Redstone 2 capsule that carried Ham, a chimpanzee, on a suborbital flight, and the Gemini 11 capsule flown by astronauts Pete Conrad and Dick Gordon on an orbital flight. U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer said she and Sen. Dianne Feinstein -- both California Democrats -- wrote to NASA's Bolden last year asking that California become home to one of the shuttles because the state has a long history with the shuttle program. Beginning in 1972, all five space shuttle orbiters were fabricated in Downey, California, and assembled in Palmdale, California, Boxer said in a statement. All of the space shuttles were tested at Edwards Air Force Base just outside of Palmdale, where 53 of NASA's 133 shuttle missions landed, she said. The Endeavour will take its final flight on April 29, and prior to this launch, it will have been used on 24 missions, orbited the earth 4,429 times and traveled 103,149,636 miles, Boxer said. ""California has a long history of supporting the shuttle program and we are proud to welcome this inspiring symbol of American scientific achievement and ingenuity to the Golden State,"" Boxer said in a statement. Audience members at the Kennedy Space Center cheered when Bolden announced the Atlantis would be assigned to that launch facility. Many people in the gallery were center workers, some of whom are likely to lose their jobs when the shuttle program ends. Because the announcement was being made at Kennedy, expectations were high that the visitor center would be awarded one of the shuttles. The Atlantis will fly the last planned shuttle mission in June, NASA said. The Museum of Flight in Seattle also wanted one. In fact, one wall of a new space gallery where a shuttle would be housed was already erected in anticipation. Prior to Tuesday's announcement, the museum's president, Doug King, said museum officials didn't have any inside information. ""I think that confident may be too strong a word. I think that hopeful is probably a better one,"" he said. But on Tuesday, Washington state Gov. Chris Gregoire also said she was disappointed that the NASA didn't select the Seattle museum for one of the retired shuttles. ""The Museum of Flight put a tremendous amount of effort into landing a retired shuttle in the Pacific Northwest. As the home of modern day air travel and the 747, which has gracefully transported shuttles for the last 30 years, Seattle would have been a perfect fit,"" Gregoire said in a statement. ""However, the full fuselage trainer, that every astronaut including Bonnie Dunbar has been trained on, will soon call the Museum of Flight home,"" the governor said. ""The largest of the trainers, this addition will allow visitors to actually climb aboard the trainer and experience the hands-on training that astronauts get. Visitors will not be allowed in the other shuttles and this trainer is a true win for our dynamic museum."" Facilities in Chicago, New York, Dayton, Ohio, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, also put in requests for an orbiter, with hopes that such a historic artifact would inspire countless children in those areas to explore careers in science and engineering. Becoming home to an orbiter promises to be a boon for a community. The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex estimates a shuttle will bring in 200,000 more guests every year. The economic impact to the area is estimated at about $15 million. At New York's Intrepid Museum, Executive Director Susan Marenoff told CNN, ""Figure over 300,000 people additional (due) to the Intrepid, to New York City. Couple that with $106 million in economic benefit. We think that's a pretty good deal."" Each winning location has to fork over $28.8 million to NASA for delivery of the vehicles. They also must guarantee a climate-controlled building will be constructed to house their shuttle. That's still a bargain, officials at the bidding locations said, because of the return on investment they expect. One of the orbiters -- Discovery, the oldest -- was largely regarded as being Smithsonian-bound. That was confirmed by Tuesday's announcement. The Enterprise, a test shuttle that never flew in space, is there now. It was be reassigned, at a discounted price, to one of the locations that didn't get either Endeavour or Atlantis. That location turned out to be the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. Only two more shuttle flights are scheduled: Endeavour on April 29 and Atlantis on June 28, wrapping up a program in which the vehicles launched satellites, built a space station, and launched and repaired an orbiting telescope. After that, they become museum pieces. Two other shuttles were destroyed in flight accidents. The Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on January 28, 1986, and the Columbia disintegrated during re-entry on February 1, 2003. CNN's Stan Wilson, Ed Lavandera and Irving Last contributed to this report.","The shuttles Discovery, Endeavour and Atlantis carry historic and economic value .

"Nashua, New Hampshire (CNN) -- ""I read all about my condition on the Internet,"" a recent patient proudly told me. Like other doctors, I'm seeing more patients research their symptoms thoroughly before setting foot in the exam room. Patients are using the Web in unprecedented ways for their own health empowerment. According to the Pew Internet & American Life Project, 61 percent of American adults looked online for health information in 2009, up from 46 percent in 2000. These ""e-patients"" are an essential part of the health care team, and play an increasingly influential role in the shared decision making process with their physicians. Health technology commentator Esther Dyson observed in the Journal of Participatory Medicine that ""the amount of medical knowledge is beyond the reach of any one person,"" and, ""because clinicians are overwhelmed ... a huge amount of responsibility is devolving to individuals."" But she also noted that e-patients encounter physicians ""who are often hostile to their efforts."" Indeed, not every physician is enamored with the e-patient. In a TIME opinion piece, orthopedic surgeon Scott Haig called a patient who Googled her own health information a ""brainsucker."" And, frustrated with the time needed to engage e-patients, he wondered, ""if there [were] patients like this in poor, war-torn countries where the need for doctors is more dire."" Most doctors, however, want their patients to be conscientious about their health and informed about their diseases. In a recent survey, health marketing firm Manhattan Research found that virtually all doctors had patients who searched for health information online, and more than two-thirds of physicians found this to be a positive trend. Given that the majority of doctors support those who take a pro-active stance with their health, why would some patients perceive physicians as hostile to their empowerment? Simply put, our health system does not promote the communication necessary for physicians to engage e-patients. Most primary care doctors practice in an environment dominated by 15-minute office visits, where encounters are rushed and questions discouraged. Patients, on average, are interrupted less than 20 seconds after they start talking, and half of them leave their appointment without fully understanding what the doctor actually said. As far back as a decade ago, more than two-thirds of physicians already reported not having enough time to spend with patients. And in the face of rising practice and malpractice insurance costs, doctors today are more fiscally pressured than ever to see a greater number of patients. Harvard internist Katherine Treadway wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine that this leads to ""care [becoming] increasingly fragmented, leaving patients angry and doctors frustrated. The time demands have exploded, which has eroded everyone's ability to develop the personal, long-term relationships that are a great source of satisfaction for providers and comfort for patients."" Furthermore, as other industries have embraced e-mail and digital record keeping, there is little financial incentive for doctors to use them. When a primary care doctor routinely sees 30 patients or more in a day, combined with hours wasted on health insurer bureaucracy, taking the additional time to e-mail patients is not fiscally feasible when it is not reimbursed by Medicare or most health insurers. And with doctors receiving only 11 percent of the savings from implementing expensive digital records -- most of which goes to health insurance companies or the government  -- it's no wonder that only 13 percent of physicians have implemented an electronic record system. Most doctors applaud patients who want to play an active role in their health. But neither the time physicians spend with their patients, nor the use of the tools necessary to facilitate a stronger patient-doctor relationship, are valued. Instead of encouraging physicians to see more patients, Medicare and the health insurers need to reward doctors who take the effort to engage e-patients both in the exam room and outside the clinic. E-patients can help, by recognizing the constraints on physicians and demanding that changes be made in the health system that will help doctors better meet the needs of empowered patients.

"(CNN) -- ""The International Olympic Committee has the honor of announcing that the 23rd Winter Olympic Games in 2018 are awarded to the city of Pyeongchang."" The date was July 6, 2011. The speaker was International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge. It might have been third time lucky for the South Korean city, having lost narrowly to Vancouver in 2010 and Sochi in 2014, but the name of Pyeongchang probably had many of us reaching for an atlas. Important point: it should not be confused with Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. 'Korea's Alps' Located approximately 113 miles (182 kilometers) southeast of Seoul, in the spectacular southern part of Gangwon Province, Pyeongchang sits at 700 meters above sea level in one of the most rugged, mountainous regions of the country, an area often referred to as ""Korea's Alps."" It seems like a reasonable choice. South Korea also has previous Olympic form -- though admittedly of the summer variety (Seoul 1988). It's also arguably a less puzzling choice than Sochi, a crumbling Soviet-era beach resort on the Black Sea coast -- ironically one of the few places in Russia where snow is actually scarce. The looming Caucasus Mountains nearby were not exactly known for snow sports either, so virtually everything -- from competition venues to road and rail links -- had to be built from scratch. 15 top Sochi moments . Yet the Sochi games went reasonably well -- from a sporting perspective at least. The action was at times exhilarating, visitors overcame hotel horror stories, and the security threat from extremists never materialized. Yet critics will point to the $50 billion price tag -- the largest ever for a summer or winter Olympic Games -- and protests against Russia's human rights record and its stance on gay rights. The sight of the Pussy Riot punk group being attacked with whips and teargas by Cossack militia making headlines across the world would have made President Vladimir Putin wince. 'Flat-pack' games . The 24th Winter Olympic Games promises to be much less controversial. It also won't have Sochi's ""flat-pack"" construction feel as Pyeongchang already boasts established infrastructure, with six major ski resorts, including Alpensia, Pheonix Park and High1, making it one of the country's top skiing and snowboarding destinations. Pyeongchang was also the site of South Korea's first official ski resort in 1975. Russia's Sochi gold rush - paradise lost, or found? Seven of the 13 competition venues required by the IOC, including those for cross-country skiing, ski jumping and biathlon, are already in place, while snow is less likely to be concern as the region typically experiences heavy winter snowfall -- something that organizers in Sochi and Vancouver could not be as confident about. Unseasonably mild temperatures bedeviled the Canadian host city in 2010, disrupting many of the ski events. Fearing similar problems, organizers at Sochi stockpiled huge amounts of snow from the previous season. Olympic legacy . Yet the South Korean government won't be sitting on their hands either, as it seeks to turn this area into a world-class winter sports destination well beyond 2018. It currently takes more than three hours by road from Seoul to reach Pyeongchang -- a journey that will shorten to just 50 minutes when a new high-speed rail network opens in 2017. Last month, the South Korean government unveiled a comprehensive plan to develop the city and the surrounding areas in Gangwon Province. Designating the region of some 27.4 square kilometers as a special district, the government announced plans to invest 3.3 trillion won (US$3.1 billion) by 2032 to turn it into ""a mecca of winter sports and a major tourist destination,"" according to the prime minister's office. Most of this investment will be made by 2018 to host a successful Winter Games, it added. Stressing the importance of preventing any waste of resources after hosting international events, Prime Minister Chung Hong-won told the Yonhap news agency: ""(The plan) should be aimed at a continued regional development after a successful hosting of the Pyeongchang Olympics."" Pyeonchang's 2018 destiny was never really in doubt, as it won the right to become the first Asian city outside Japan to host the Winter Olympics. It comfortably beat off the challenge of two other bid cities: Munich in Germany, and Annecy in France. Had it won, Munich would have been the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics. The city attracted the Summer Games in 1972. Annecy, meanwhile, met with many difficulties in its bid for the 2018 nomination, including a small budget and change in leadership on the bid committee.","Third time lucky for Pyeongchang, which lost out to Vancouver in 2010 and Sochi in 2014 .

"China and North Korea have slammed a U.N. report that found crimes against humanity committed in the reclusive Democratic People's Republic of Korea. At the Monday session of the Human Rights Council, China's representative called a landmark report that was highly critical of North Korea's human rights record ""divorced from reality."" The diplomat's words indicate that China, a permanent member of the Security Council, may block attempts to refer North Korean issues to the International Criminal Court. In February, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea published a 400-page report documenting the widespread torture and abuse, and called for urgent action including the referral of its findings to the ICC for possible prosecution. Pyongyang's representative accused the entire commission of being spurred by ""lies"" and ""hostile forces."" The North Korean official objected and left when the Japanese representative brought in the head of a Japanese association for families, whose loved ones have been reportedly abducted by North Korea, to make a statement. The almost yearlong investigation by the commission involved more than 320 witnesses in public hearings and private interviews. It listed a litany of abuses including a new mother being forced to drown her newborn, corpses being eaten by dogs and rampant beatings. ""If this report does not give rise to action, it is difficult to imagine what will,"" said Michael Kirby, the Commission of Inquiry's chair. Why North Korea probably won't change despite damning U.N. report . 'Scourge of human rights violations' He urged the international community to take action. ""Contending with the scourges of Nazism, apartheid, the Khmer Rouge and other affronts required great courage by great nations and ordinary human beings alike.  It is now your solemn duty to address the scourge of human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."" North Korea is a state, the report concluded, ""that does not content itself with ensuring the authoritarian rule of a small group of people, but seeks to dominate every aspect of its citizens' lives and terrorizes them from within."" North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, So Se Pyong said the United States and ""other hostile forces"" had fabricated the report in an attempt to ""defame the dignified image of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and eventually eliminate its social system."" He charged that the testimonies by defectors and witnesses were fabrications by criminals who fled North Korea. Everyone in North Korea is guaranteed human rights and freedoms, So maintained. ""We defend our social system. It's the cradle of life and happiness."" So said North Korea takes ""sincere efforts"" to make peace in the Korean peninsula and blamed joint South Korea-U.S. military exercises. On Sunday, North Korea launched 25 short-range rockets from its east coast into open water, according to South Korea. So did not address any of the report's points regarding the right to food, prison camps, torture and inhuman treatment, arbitrary detention, discrimination, freedom of expression, the right to life, freedom of movement, and enforced disappearances, including abductions of other citizens. He blamed the United States saying it should be investigated for ""egregious human rights violations."" Kirby said the diplomat's statement was a ""diversion"" instead of addressing human rights concerns. Report: North Korea 'experienced' in evading U.N. sanctions . China backs North Korea . North Korea found support from its staunchest ally, China, which also disputed the report's findings. Its representative, Chen Chuandong said the report could not be fair and impartial because of ""the inability of the Commission to get support and cooperation from the country concerned."" During the 11-month investigation, the commission's request for access into North Korea and information were denied or ignored. China said the inability to get cooperation from North Korea put the credibility of the report in question. ""The commission makes conclusions and recommendations -- many of them are divorced from reality and highly politicized,"" Chen said. China also came under human rights criticism by the commission for its policy of repatriating North Koreans. Many of the repatriated North Koreans are sent to prison camps or even sentenced to death for escaping their country, according to human rights groups. Chen defended China's practice of returning North Koreans. ""The Koreans who enter illegally, they have breached China's laws and border administration,"" he said. ""They enter illegally, they are not refugees."" China and North Korea enjoy a relatively close relationship, stemming from when China joined the Korean War on the northern side against U.N. troops in 1950. China remains North Korea's biggest trading partner and has helped sustain three generations of the Kim regime. That relationship continues today as China's nuclear representative, Wu Dawei was in Pyongyang on Monday, according to North Korea's state-run media, KCNA.","U.N.

"(CNN)There may be plenty of idiots on the road, but is putting them in the skies taking it, quite literally, to the next dimension? For Dr. Heinrich H. Bülthoff -- one of the leading researchers on the 'MyCopter' project -- it's a serious question. Making an idiot-proof flying car that anyone can pilot has involved years of painstaking research and may be the secret to the long-held dream of firing up the rotors, levitating and simply flying out of the bumper-to-bumper grind. Now the European Union wants to make the dream a reality, researching the feasibility of small commuter air vehicles to ease the world's traffic congestion. ""It's been a dream of mine since I read it in science fiction books and in the movies as a kid, but science fiction is becoming the reality these days,"" says Dr. Bülthoff,  director of perception, cognition and action at the Max Planck Institute in Tübingen, Germany. Under the four-year project, the EU has drawn together six institutes from across Europe to look at the problems associated with commuting in personal aviation vehicles (PAVs). At the center of the research is a focus, not so much on building the vehicle, but on all the issues and challenges surrounding commuter aviation. In the case of his institute, it's how to make the machine accessible to ordinary drivers. A flying car for everybody . ""There's no intention with this project to actually build the system,"" explains Dr.Bülthoff whose research is part of a 2007 EU report called ""Out of the Box: Ideas About the Future of Air Transport"". ""They said to us 'please, not another proposal for a flying vehicle' - we have received so many - there are so many other issues to address,"" he said. These challenges involve setting up ""virtual corridor"" traffic systems in the sky that guide PAVs under existing aircraft, using advances in swarm technology to stop them crashing into each other and working on landing systems that do not involve air traffic controllers. ""If you want to make a flying car it should be for everybody, but you can't make every car driver into a pilot,"" he said. ""The idea is to fly in uncontrolled airspace without interfering with all the other aircraft."" He said the plan is to make the flying vehicles so intelligent, they communicate with each other and avoid collisions without any human input. Keeping it simple . His institute, in particular, is focused on the problems of the human-machine interface: creating a design that reduces the withering array of dials and monitors in a helicopter or plane into a few simple controls on a dashboard. Keeping the simple steering wheel on a flying vehicle -- where controls must make adjustments for traveling through three rather than two dimensions -- has been just one of the challenges of the project. ""For more than 100 years cars have used the steering wheel. It was a good idea for cars, but if you make the transition to the air why should a driver learn something completely new?"" he said. Pilotless planes . The aircraft would be largely autonomous and would, for the most part, need no piloting at all. Flying through ""highways in the sky"" - flight paths designed to host swarms of PAVs flying in formation - the PAVs would avoid obstacles and select landing spots autonomously by using intelligent sight sensors. The controls would be shared between the pilot and the machine allowing for what researchers call ""comprehensive situational awareness."" So-called ""haptic"" controls that put a feeling of resistance in the steering wheel would allow drivers to know when they were edging towards the confines of the ""highway in the sky"". Other aspects of the study have looked at the social impact of PAVs as the commuter vehicle of the future. ""Many people might ask whether we really want thousands of these things buzzing around in the sky,"" Dr Bülthoff said. Researchers have been looking at ways of constructing PAV flight paths above existing freeways and roads to minimize the environmental impact, keeping the flight ceiling at 50 meters to avoid commercial aircraft. While flying time is relatively short due to the constraints of battery life using current technology, researchers on the project had found that 90 percent of commuter trips were shorter than 25 km (15 miles) and averaged about 30 minutes with peak hour delays of about 15 minutes, making a PAV perfect for short hop journeys from work to home. Google holds open the door . Dr Bülthoff said recent advances, and social acceptance of, Google's driverless car had given real hope to researchers on the project. ""That really makes me very optimistic,"" he said. ""The car industry has been producing the same basic model of automobile for more than 100 years. Google is doing something that is making the car industry wake up. I would never have expected that several states in the United States have legalized autonomous driving, for example."" ""Even so, there are many issues still to be examined. Legally, for instance, if there's no driver we don't know who's responsible in case of a crash. These questions still need to be answered."" While the driverless car is now a reality, he says it might be some time yet before anyone can walk into a dealership and buy a personal aviation vehicle. ""The timescale is to have them available by 2050,"" says Dr Bülthoff. ""But I am not likely to be around in 2050, so I'm quietly optimistic that we will have one before that.""

"(CNN) -- Mutant horrors, singers and kissing strangers had a big year on YouTube. All of the above joined soccer stars, a bending iPhone, a beer commercial and a dose of street activism on the video site's list of the most popular posts of 2014. S.A. Wardega, a Polish actor, director and Web prankster, scored the top spot with ""Mutant Giant Spider Dog,"" which had scared up more than 113 million views since he posted it in September. In it, Wardega films people in everyday situations into which he unleashes his otherwise cute dog, Chica, wearing a costume that gives the pooch eight giant, creepy spider legs. . It wasn't without a dose of controversy. ""Someone reported a SpiderDog video to the prosecution claiming that threatening (sic) endangered the life of the people who were there,"" Wardega, whose first name is Sylwester, wrote in September on his Facebook page. ""I wonder who will go to jail? Me or Chica? Or maybe a spider costume?"" Taking the No. 3 spot, behind a Nike ad featuring soccer stars like Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney, was ""First Kiss,"" a social experiment of sorts in which complete strangers are brought together and asked to kiss each other. Except, this one wasn't exactly as it first appeared. It was commissioned by Wren Studio, a small clothing company, to showcase a new clothing line. Almost all of those awkward strangers were, in fact, models. . ""In all fairness, the people in the video could still be classified as 'strangers' by definition, but that's like calling a kid who plays Call of Duty for 12 hours a day 'an amateur',"" read a Complex article titled ""That Adorable 'First Kiss' Video That Everyone Is Talking About Is a Fake."" ""Never trust the Internet."" Director Tatia Pilieva said there was never an intent to deceive anyone, noting that the video begins with the words ""Wren presents ..."" and the clothing company is mentioned in the credits. ""It felt so real and sincere and it was,"" she told the New York Times, saying each couple really did meet for the first time the day they shot. ""They shed all these layers in front of our eyes and in front of the cameras and that sweetness and kindness resonated with people."" The Internet appears not to mind. The video has more than 94 million views. In fifth place is the video that launched a million tech-blog posts -- the ""iPhone 6 Plus Bend Test."" Is the iPhone 6 Plus bendable? Unbox Therapy, a Web video series focusing on consumer electronics, posted a video after online reports began popping up of Apple's massive, new phone bending in people's pockets. . The September video, which has racked up more than 59 million views, shows a host, Lewis Hilsenteger, bending one of the aluminum phones with his hands. Not that the problem, if it is one, has scared many folks away.

"New DNA tests reveal Britain's long-lost King Richard III was blue-eyed and likely blond-haired, but they also raise intriguing questions over whether he -- and other monarchs before and since -- should have been on the throne at all. Experts researching the case of the ""King in the car park"" -- a set of remains dug up from beneath a parking lot in the central English city of Leicester in 2012 -- now say they are 99.999% positive that the bones are those of Richard III, who died at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Genetic specialist Turi King, from the University of Leicester, said analysis of various genetic markers offered tantalizing clues to Richard III's appearance -- suggesting that he was not the dark-haired, steely-eyed monarch portrayed in well-known historical images. ""[There are] genes that we know are involved in coding for hair and eye color ... The genetic evidence shows he had a 96% probability of having blue eyes, and a 77% probability of having blond hair, though this can darken with age."" While there are no contemporary portraits of Richard -- all known works post-date his death by at least 25 to 30 years, leaving the artists who painted them open to charges that they were influenced by propaganda -- the DNA findings suggest the arch-framed portrait of Richard, owned by the Society of Antiquaries of London, is the closest to his real appearance. King said the latest scientific evidence, combined with statistical analysis -- published in Nature Communications and funded by the Wellcome Trust and Leverhulme Trust -- provided ""overwhelming"" proof of the skeleton's identity: ""At its most conservative, it's 99.999% certain,"" she explained. ""The likelihood ratio is 6.7 million to one that these are Richard's remains."" Richard III's bones reveal fatal blows . But while detailed genetic testing and painstaking genealogical research helped confirm that one living relative on Richard's female line, Michael Ibsen, was an exact match to his mitochondrial DNA, and found a second, previously unknown but near-perfect mitochondrial match in New Zealand-born Londoner Wendy Duldig, scientists weren't able to trace a living relative on the male line, using the Y chromosome. And that has raised an intriguing possibility: that neither he, nor many other monarchs, actually had a cast-iron claim to the throne. Genealogy expert Kevin Shürer said it had been relatively straightforward to trace potential living relatives of Richard III along the male line, since records of the peerage -- Britain's ""nobility"" -- made it simple to follow such families back century after century. But once five potential living relatives from the male line, linking Richard III to his predecessor Edward III (because Richard himself had no surviving children) and back down the generations via John of Gaunt (1340-1399) and Henry Somerset, the fifth Duke of Beaufort (1744-1803), had been identified, things became more complicated. One of the five was quickly eliminated from the puzzle because his Y chromosome DNA did not match the other four, suggesting a relatively recent ""false paternity event,"" and when King carried out checks on the Y chromosome DNA of the remaining four, she discovered there was no match there either, revealing at least one other case of ""false paternity"" in the generations of fathers and sons leading back to Edward III. ""We can't tell you where that break is, because we simply don't know -- it could be at any one of the 19 links in the chain between those two individuals,"" Shürer said, adding that while each link in that chain was equally likely to be the one which was ""broken,"" if the break occurred in the first few generations, around Richard III, it could bring various monarchs' right to rule into question. ""There are some well-known and important people on that chain,"" he said.  ""You have two monarchs, Richard and Edward III; if the break occurred on the Yorkist line ... then that might raise questions about the legitimacy of the Yorkists' claim to the throne. ""The Lancastrian line comes through John of Gaunt's side of the family ... so if the break were on that side, it raises questions about the legitimacy of the Lancastrian monarchs, and because there was a Tudor link to that line as well, also the Tudors."" But he said the Tudors also had another argument for their right to rule, since they ""took the throne by force, at the Battle of Bosworth."" And he was quick to point out that whatever the implications of the latest discovery, current monarch Queen Elizabeth II's position was secure. ""We're certainly not saying the House of Windsor has no legitimate claim to the throne, far from it,"" Shürer explained. ""Royal succession doesn't work like that. There is no linear succession line between Edward III and Elizabeth II. Yes, they are related, but the whole point of monarchy is that over several centuries it takes various twists and turns. ""Monarchy is about opportunity and chance as much as it is about bloodline."" Richard III's taste for luxury revealed .

"Any old city can string up a few lights downtown and call it a holiday celebration. From Mexico to Malta, northern lights to sunny skies, these places are doing Christmas better than the rest this year. Bath, England . There are few cities in the world where you can celebrate the birth of Jesus and the birth of Jane Austen with the same amount of fanfare, but Bath happens to be one of them. The Theatre Royal, which Austen mentions in ""Northanger Abbey"" and ""Persuasion,"" is home to a musical celebration accompanied by mince pies and mulled wine in honor of the literary doyenne. There's also a varied program of holiday drama, musicals, opera and concerts, including Cinderella and Rumpelstiltskin. A seasonal favorite, the 18-day Bath Christmas Market has over 170 wooden chalets selling distinctively British handmade crafts in a quaint Georgian setting. Straddled between the imposing Bath Abbey and the venerable Roman Baths, the market offers a festive way to discover the character of Bath, which is the only entire city in the UK to have been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Bath on Ice is a great excuse to bundle up and lace up your skates, while the Thermae Bath Spa is the perfect reason to strip down and savor the steam emanating from the thermal mineral-rich waters of an open-air rooftop pool with spectacular views over the city. New York . Rockefeller Center lies at the core of the New York Christmas. Its famed ice rink has been around for 78 years; the decorated tree is an 81-year-old tradition. Across the street, Radio City hosts the annual Christmas Spectacular, starring the Rockettes. On the southwest corner of Central Park, Columbus Circle hosts more than 100 vendors selling clothes, gifts, snacks and drinks at the Holiday Market. Central Park has two ponds for skating and horse-drawn carriage rides. Fashion's biggest names join in the festivities, setting up impressive Christmas window displays. The most glamorous cases, at the Fifth Avenue flagships and department stores like Saks and Bergdorf, are impressive enough to melt the heart of Anna Wintour. Malta . Visiting presepju, or nativity scenes, is an integral part of Christmas in Malta. Every year, residents proudly open their shutters, and sometimes even their garage doors, to display their holy crib confections to the public. On a grander scale, the Bethlehem f'Ghajnsielem is a life-size nativity experience spread over 20,0000 square meters of formerly abandoned fields. Inhabited and animated by over 150 actors comprised of entire families, the village takes visitors back in time to Judea of 2,000 years ago, complete with oil lamps, turn mills, grazing animals, crafts areas teaching traditional skills and folklore, a tavern, and of course a grotto housing baby Jesus. Downtown Valletta is also home to a lively Christmas spirit, with carolers singing outside the Baroque St. John's Co-Cathedral during advent, and a dizzying display of Christmas lights on Republic Street. The Manoel Theater is well known for its annual Christmas pantomime -- this year Pinocchio themed. A visit to the privately owned Museum of Toys featuring dolls, soldiers, train sets, and clockwork tin trinkets dating as far back as the 1790's, is a heartwarming homage to childhood. Barcelona, Spain . If you can manage to extend your Christmas holiday until Three King's Day (January 5), there's no better place to catch up with Melchior, Gaspar and Balthazar than Barcelona. On the evening of January 4, they arrive at the city's port on the Santa Eulalia -- their very own ship -- in bearded and velvet-robed splendor. Canons are fired, fireworks are set off, and as the mayor hands them the keys to the city, the magic of the Magi officially commences. They parade through the streets in a magnificent cavalcade of floats that includes camels, elephants, giraffes and dazzling costumes. Rovaniemi, Lapland, Finland . While legends dating as far back as the 1820s cite the North Pole as the official home of Santa Claus and his jolly missus, the Finns would have us believe otherwise. For them, Rovaniemi, Lapland, located just north of the Arctic Circle, is Christmas HQ. Here, children make gingerbread cookies with Mrs. Claus, enroll in Elf School or take a calligraphy class and compose their Christmas wish lists with a traditional quill. Other area attractions include the Ranua Zoo, home to baby polar bears, wolverines and moose; Sirmakko reindeer farm, where visitors can take a sled-led reindeer safari; and the Arktikum, a science center where the mystery of the northern lights is revealed. Those in search of a truly frosty experience can stay in the Arctic Snow Hotel, made entirely of snow and ice, but equipped with saunas and hot tubs in which to thaw. Nuremberg, Germany . The Nuremberg Christmas market (Nurnberger Christkindlesmarkt) is a German institution, pulling in more than 2 million visitors each year. Highlights include a giant carved wooden Ferris wheel, old-fashioned carousel and steam train. Unlike all those ""fake"" Christmas markets that have been popping up in the region, Nuremberg's Christmas Market Council is serious about making sure only traditional handmade toys and holiday goods are sold. No mass-produced plastic garlands here. The market's 200 select vendors also put up fantastic displays as they compete for the Most Beautiful Stall Design award. The top three walk away with a gold, silver or bronze ""Plum People"" awards. Adults can enjoy Nuremberg spicy gingerbread and mugs of mulled wine. For kids, there's the Toy Museum, while the German Railway Museum is a hit with everyone. Quebec City, Canada . If you're the type who likes to celebrate Christmas around a tree made from recycled sheet metal, with lights powered by the pedaling of nearby cyclists, Quebec is your destination. A haven for environmentally friendly, outdoor enthusiasts, the city bustles with activity, offering holiday programs for all tastes. Modern-day Victorians can enjoy a candlelit evening of stories from Charles Dickens, recounting the Christmas traditions of yore. Sausage and roast chestnut lovers can browse the wares at the German Christmas market. The more religiously inclined can wander an exposition of nativity scenes from around the world. The nearby Sentier des Caps de Charlevoix offers family-friendly hiking, snowshoeing and skiing, while speed devils can zoom around in a snowmobile from Nord Expe. Reykjavik, Iceland . When it comes to Christmas celebrations, Iceland has a few peculiarities. Among these, 13 ""Yuletide Lads"" (scruffy Santas) are said to bring gifts to nice children for the 13 nights leading to Christmas. Rows of small, beautiful huts make up the Yule Town Christmas market on Ingolfstorg. Here, visitors can pick up colorful Christmas gifts, decorations and treats. The shopping differs day to day as some craftsmen and designers set up stalls for only one day. Beaming down onto a city covered in snow and Christmas lights, northern lights displays add to Reykjavik's festival feel. San Miguel de Allende, Mexico . Piñatas, posadas and ponche sum up the festivities in this colorful Mexican city, where Christmas is both a solemn and celebratory affair. Leading up to December 24, you're likely to stumble upon Mary and Joseph strolling the streets, as locals make pilgrimages from home to home, singing to ""ask for posada"" or ""beg for shelter"" as they reenact the journey to Bethlehem. Pinatas and ponche (a mulled fruit drink) cap a long evening of peregrinations around this cobblestoned city, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its wealth of grand churches, well-preserved architecture and grand zocalos. Santa Claus, Indiana . Christmas is a year-round occasion in this town of fewer than 3,000 residents. Santa Claus, Indiana, receives thousands of letters a year from children trying to reach St. Nick himself. A group of volunteers called Santa's Elves was set up in the mid-1930s to reply to each letter. The Land of Lights display is a 1.2-mile drive around the Lake Rudolph Campground & RV Resort. Among various Christmas-themed events, Santa hosts a buffet dinner at the Christmas Lodge every Friday leading up to Christmas. Strasbourg, France . Strasbourg's series of themed Christmas villages morph the city into a visual and gastronomic wonderland. Visitors can head to the Village of Alsace Farmhouse to taste prune, apricot and other holiday-inspired variations of farm-fresh foie gras. The nearby Village of Bredle is supplied with its namesake traditional Christmas biscuits and copious amounts of mulled Alsatian wine. From the Strasbourg Philharmonic to gospel to Django Reinhardt-inspired gypsy jazz, Strasbourg's Christmas program is packed with concerts and cultural events from Croatia, the guest country of Strasbourg's Christmas celebrations this year. Valkenburg, The Netherlands . This small town is the Dutch center for Christmas festivities. Valkenburg's Velvet Cave is transformed into a Christmas Market and the residence of Santa, where visitors can see his room of presents and reindeer sleigh. The cavern houses sculptures and an 18th-century chapel, as well as preserved mural drawings that date to Roman times. Marlstone products and traditional Polish handicrafts are a few of the unique items exclusive to Valkenburg's Christmas markets. Best way to reach the Christmas town? A Christmas Express train that runs regularly between Simpelveld and Valkenburg.","Visiting presepju, or nativity scenes, is an integral part of Christmas in Malta .

"(CNN)Reigning Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton was the fastest man on the tracks during the second last day of pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya near Barcelona Saturday. The Mercedes driver notched up the best lap of the day after changing from the slower medium compound to soft tires. Yet his time of one minute, 23.022 seconds was still marginally slower than that achieved by team-mate and 2014 driver's championship rival, Nico Rosberg on the soft tires on Friday. The Englishman later told reporters he would have liked more laps having missed last week's practice session due to illness but was content with how the car was performing. ""It's been generally good,"" Hamilton said in quotes carried by the AFP news agency. ""The team has done a great job to get all the components here and reliability has been strong. We are in as good a shape as we can be."" Mercedes were by far and away the dominant force in F1 last year and there was little indication Saturday that this will not be the case in 2015. Williams were the closest challengers, as they had been on Friday, with Felipe Massa finding his best time of the testing season. But this was still fully two tenths of a second down on Hamilton despite Massa being on the faster super-soft tires at the time. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen clocked third fastest time of the day, marginally over one hundredth of a second behind Massa. Saturday proved yet another unhappy day for the CNN sponsored McLaren-Honda team as reserve driver Kevin Magnussen's participation was cut short after his car suffered an oil leak. Magnussen was standing in for Fernando Alonso who suffered concussion after crashing last Sunday. ""The day stopped a little too early for us,"" said McLaren racing director Eric Boullier. ""We didn't do as many laps as we wanted. It is true it is going to hurt the development of the car on the performance side, but we will recover."" The F1 season gets underway in Melbourne on March 15.","Lewis Hamilton fastest on second last day of F1 testing at Circuit de Catalunya .

"When you're a city's ""Communicator of the Year"" and have hailed yourself as a ""passionate advocate"" for job-seekers, you probably ought not blast one of those job-seekers in a snide, dismissive e-mail. Because the Internet hates that sort of thing. But that's what's happened to Kelly Blazek, who runs a popular online job bank for marketing professionals in Cleveland. Blazek's response to an e-mail and LinkedIn request from Diana Mekota, a 26-year-old planning to move to Cleveland this summer, has made the rounds on Reddit, Buzzfeed and other viral hotspots after Mekota posted it to her Imgur account. And the resulting backlash is yet another cautionary tale about how posting something mean-spirited online can come back to haunt you in the social media age. ""Your invite to connect is inappropriate, beneficial only to you, and tacky,"" Blazek wrote, according to Mekota's post. ""Wow, I cannot wait to let every 26-year-old jobseeker mine my top-tier marketing connections to help them land a job."" And she was just getting warmed up. ""I love the sense of entitlement in your generation,"" she wrote, then continued. ""You're welcome for your humility lesson for the year. Don't ever reach out to senior practitioners again and assume their carefully curated list of connections is available to you, just because you want to build your network."" She wrapped up with: ""Don't ever write me again."" How social media can affect your job search . Mekota's original e-mail, sent February 19, was a short message detailing her education, professional and volunteer activities and asking to join the 7,300-member jobs list. She said she got Blazek's response shortly afterward and, after composing herself, wrote a response. ""I realize you told me to never write you again, but wanted to reach out as there has been a large miscommunication and I merely wanted to explain myself,"" she wrote. She said she sent a LinkedIn request so Blazek could see her credentials because a friend told her not to send a resume. ""I apologize if this came off as arrogant or invasive as that was never my intention,"" she wrote. ""I was again, hoping to join your very impressive job board but I understand you(r) reservations."" After the posts went viral (spawning, for one, the obligatory Twitter parody account), Blazek on Wednesday e-mailed an apology to the Cleveland Plain-Dealer. She repeated the statement in an email response to CNN, saying she has apologized to ""everyone involved."" ""I am very sorry to the people I have hurt,"" she wrote. ""Creating and updating the Cleveland Job Bank listings has been my hobby for more than ten years. It started as a labor of love for the marketing industry, but somehow it also became a labor, and I vented my frustrations on the very people I set out to help."" Blazek was named 2013's ""Communicator of the Year"" by Cleveland's branch of the International Association of Business Communicators. ""I've always been a passionate advocate for keeping talent in NE Ohio, and we have so much of it in the region,"" she said in her acceptance speech. ""I want my subscribers to feel like everyone is my little sister or brother, and I'm looking out for them."" On Thursday, she appeared to have deleted her Twitter account and Wordpress blog. ""The note I sent to Diana was rude, unwelcoming, unprofessional and wrong ...,"" she said in her e-mail. ""Diana and her generation are the future of this city. I wish her all the best in landing a job in this great town."" Playing it safe in the social media world . On Twitter, Mekota confirmed having received an apology. ""Would like to let you know Kelly Blazek has sent a very nice apology email, for which I thank her,"" she wrote. But this may not have been the first time Blazek has had a nasty exchange with a potential job-bank member. Rick Uldricks told CNN affiliate WJW-TV in Cleveland that he received a similar response in December when he messaged Blazek saying he'd been deleted from the jobs list and would like to be added again. ""I suggest you join the other Job Bank in town. Oh -- guess what. There isn't one,"" Blazek wrote, according to an e-mail he provided the station. ""Done with this conversation, and you."" According to the Plain Dealer, she has also apologized to Uldricks. Read more: The etiquette of constant photos, Facebook .

"French forces who secured the site of a crashed Air Algerie flight in Mali found one flight recorder but no survivors, French President Francoise Hollande said Friday. Wreckage of the jet was found in a ""disintegrated state"" in Mali, he said, making it the third major international aviation disaster in recent days. ""Regrettably, there were no survivors. I share the pain of the families, who are going through terrible hardship,"" he said. Hollande said the families of the French nationals aboard the plane -- the largest group from any one nation -- would be welcomed to the Foreign Ministry on Saturday to be given all the latest information. Airline authorities said Flight 5017 was carrying 116 people when it took off early Thursday from Burkina Faso to Algeria. Less than an hour into the flight, the aircraft, an MD-83, disappeared from radar after changing its flight path because of bad weather, officials said. The one ""black box"" recorder found so far is being taken to Gao, Mali, and will be examined as soon as possible, Hollande said. ""What we already know is that the plane's debris is concentrated in a limited area,"" he said. ""But it is still too early to draw any conclusions, they will come in time. There are hypotheses, including weather conditions, but we are not putting any of them aside because we want to find out everything that happened."" The plane's wreckage was found in Mali's Gossi region, not very far from the border with Burkina Faso, according to the French President. Turbulent area . Radar contact with the plane was lost 50 minutes after takeoff from the Burkina Faso capital of Ouagadougou, authorities said. The jet was supposed to arrive later that day at Houari Boumediene Airport in Algiers. Mali is between the two nations. Though the cause of the crash is unknown, the flight path took the aircraft through a turbulent area hit by regular thunderstorms at this time of year, according to CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the cause of the accident was still unknown but that ""significant storms were active in the area and the crew explicitly had the attention to reroute due to weather before losing contact with aircraft,"" according to CNN's French affiliate BFMTV. Differing accounts continue to emerge of the number and nationalities of people on the plane. Air Algerie said the plane was carrying 110 passengers and six crew members, but Hollande gave a different number. ""My thoughts go to the 118 victims, those close to them and their families,"" he said. Hollande said 51 French nations were on board but at a news conference later Friday, broadcast by BFMTV. Fabius put the number at 54. Fabius said the aim was to bring the victims' remains as quickly as possible to Gao, so that they can be identified and returned to their home countries. Mamadou Zoungrana told CNN Canadian affiliate CBC that his wife and two sons were on the flight. She had wanted to leave on an earlier flight. ""I didn't want to change the flight,"" he said. ""I said it will be OK. Maybe if I canceled."" The plane's departure country of Burkina Faso had 24 people aboard, the airline said, while Lebanon had eight. The passengers also included six Algerians; five Canadians; four Germans; two from Luxembourg; and one each from Mali, Cameroon, Belgium, Ukraine, Romania, Nigeria and Egypt, Air Algerie said. Air Algerie said all six crew members were Spanish. The plane belongs to a private Spanish company, Swiftair, but was operated by Air Algerie. Burkina Faso's Prime Minister Luc Adolphe Tiao said 28 of those aboard were from Burkina Faso, four more than the number stated by the airline. The presidents of the European Commission and European Parliament, Jose Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy, expressed their ""deepest condolences"" to the families of the victims in a joint statement Friday. ""We also wish to express our sympathy and solidarity to the governments of all affected nations, including to the French and Algerian Presidents,"" they said. Burkina Faso: No link to our role in Mali . The wreckage was located by a helicopter sent by Burkina Faso, Tiao said, according to his government's website. He also said there was ""no link"" between the crash and the mediating role played by Algeria and his own country in the ongoing conflict in northern Mali between government forces, backed up by French troops, and Islamist militants. He said the three countries must work hand in hand to clarify the situation and support the families of the victims. Air Algerie's crash came less than 24 hours after a twin-engine plane crashed while attempting to land Wednesday in Taiwan's Penghu Islands, killing 48 of the 58 people on board, and a week after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed in Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. Air Algerie, Algeria's national airline, flies to 28 countries. Until this week, the deadliest incident in the airline's history occurred in March 2003 when a domestic flight crashed after takeoff, killing 102 people on board. One person survived. The MD-83 is part of the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 family of twin-engine, single-aisle jets. Opinion: Despite plane crashes, it's safe to fly . Taiwan plane crash kills 48 and injures 10 .

"Tacoma, Washington (CNN) -- Teachers in Tacoma, Washington, have voted to continue their strike, in defiance of a a court order to stop. Rich Wood, the spokesman for the Tacoma teachers union, said teachers voted Thursday to continue their strike despite a judge's Wednesday order. At a union meeting Thursday afternoon, 1,478 teachers voted to keep striking, Wood said, adding that 107 voted ""no"" or abstained.  He said teachers were concerned about how Judge Bryan Chushcoff would react to their defying his order. The Tacoma School District did not return a call seeking comment, but a message posted on the district's website said school for 28,000 students would be suspended again Friday, as it has been for the rest of the week. Chushcoff's order on Wednesday was in a case the district brought against the striking teachers and their union. After the ruling, District Superintendent Art Jarvis said he expected teachers to return to work while the union and school district continued stalled contract negotiations. At the time of the ruling, a hearing was scheduled for Friday to ensure the union complied with the judge's order. Chushcoff also ordered hearings on the legality of the strike and stalled negotiations. Attorneys for the school district argued that since teachers are state employees they do not have the right to strike. ""The illegal strike has forced the district to close 57 schools, disrupting the lives of approximately 30,000 students and their families,"" school district attorney Shannon McMinimee wrote in the lawsuit. McMinimee argued that if the strike continued indefinitely the protest would harm students, particularly children with disabilities, low-income pupils who rely on meals provided at schools and seniors applying to college next year. ""Students in Tacoma, under the Constitution, are entitled to an education,"" she said. Some 1,900 teachers went on strike this week after talks broke down over a new contract for educators. The teachers union argued the school district was unyielding on the issues of class size, teacher pay and how teachers are transferred between schools. Tyler Firkins, the attorney for the teachers union, said the school district was not negotiating in good faith and that if the strike continued, students could make up the missed time later. ""What they are saying is that the school year is immovable, can't be changed under any circumstances. That is not correct,"" Firkins said. ""Whether my child misses a week or two, it's not going to affect her education,"" Firkins said of his daughter, who he said attends classes at a Tacoma public school. ""This is about teaching our kids to stand up to bullies,"" said Andy Coons, president of the teachers union.  ""I'm disappointed that we're not bargaining, that we're spending the day in court."" The state judge said the school district's arguments that students were being harmed by the strike were enough reason to halt the protests, at least until more hearings and negotiations could be held. Calling himself ""a product of the Tacoma school district,"" Chushcoff said if anyone didn't like his ruling, they could blame it on his education. During Wednesday's court session, Chushcoff held up photographs of a sign he said had been placed at his home. The printed sign said ""Support Tacoma teachers."" ""It's not appropriate to try and influence or intimidate me,"" he said.","NEW: Tacoma teachers vote to continue strike .

"(CNN) -- Comedian Joan Rivers died in a New York hospital Thursday afternoon, a week after suffering cardiac arrest during a medical procedure, her daughter said. ""She passed peacefully at 1:17 p.m. surrounded by family and close friends,"" Melissa Rivers said in a written statement. The funeral for Rivers will be at Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan on Sunday, according to temple spokeswoman Elizabeth Fezrine. Details, including the time and if the public will be allowed to attend, are not yet known, she said. Joan Rivers: A pointed, pioneering comedian . Rivers, 81, had been on life support at Manhattan's Mount Sinai hospital, where she was taken after she stopped breathing at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic last Thursday. Rivers was undergoing an apparently minor elective procedure at the clinic when she suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest, according to the New York Fire Department. Paramedics took her by ambulance to Mount Sinai Hospital, about a mile from the clinic, where she was initially listed in critical condition. The outpatient clinic is now being investigated by the New York State Department of Health, spokesman James O'Hara said. Joan Rivers: In her own words . Her death also has triggered an investigation by the New York medical examiner's office, its spokeswoman, Julie Bolcer, told CNN. ""The cause and manner of death will be announced at some point,"" she said. The Rivers family made very little information about her medical condition public, finally confirming Tuesday that she was on life support. ""My son and I would like to thank the doctors, nurses, and staff of Mount Sinai Hospital for the amazing care they provided for my mother,"" her daughter said. ""Cooper and I have found ourselves humbled by the outpouring of love, support, and prayers we have received from around the world. They have been heard and appreciated.' Melissa Rivers and her son Cooper have spent the past week by Rivers' hospital bedside, rushing there last Thursday when they learned of her illness. 'My mother's greatest joy in life was to make people laugh,"" Melissa Rivers said. ""Although that is difficult to do right now, I know her final wish would be that we return to laughing soon."" Share your memories . The clinic has not responded to repeated calls from CNN about the state's investigation. Yorkville Endoscopy's website says it is an ""ambulatory surgical center"" that has been ""approved by the Department of Health."" The description of its accreditations is blank. ""Yorkville Endoscopy is a state of the art facility, staffed by highly experienced endoscopists whose mission is to provide safe and compassionate care to patients and their families,"" the website says. Tributes from Joan's friends . Tributes to Rivers and her long career included one from former first lady Nancy Reagan, whose close circle of friends included Rivers. ""Joan Rivers was not only a dear friend, but one of the kindest and funniest people I ever knew,"" Reagan said. ""I doubt there's anyone who hasn't laughed at her or with her until they cried. Today our tears are those of sadness. I know I join millions in saying, 'Thanks for the good times Joan, we will truly miss you.' My love and deepest sympathy go to Melissa and Cooper."" Former CNN host Larry King knew Rivers for 45 years. ""She knew no boundaries,"" King said. ""Everything was funny to her. You couldn't really object because she took no prisoners."" Hollywood mourns a friend . Donald Trump, who chose her as the winner on a season of ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" said Rivers ""was stronger at the end than she was at the beginning. She had unbelievable stamina."" Ryan Seacrest, who worked with her on E! shows, called Rivers ""a trailblazer in so many ways."" Liza Minnelli said Rivers was ""my dear friend."" ""I will miss her but I will always remember the laughter and friendship she brought into my life,"" Minnelli said. Opinion: Joan Rivers gave misfit girls permission to dream . E! and NBCUniversal, producers of Rivers' TV show ""Fashion Police,"" sent condolences to her family on ""this incredibly sad day."" ""For decades Joan has made people laugh, shattered glass ceilings and revolutionized comedy,"" the studio said. ""She was unapologetic and fiercely dedicated to entertaining all of us and has left an indelible mark on the people that worked with her and on her legions of fans.  She's been a much beloved member of the E! family for over 20 years and the world is less funny without her in it.  Today our hearts are heavy knowing Joan will not be bounding through the doors.""

"What started with days of traffic jams in an obscure New Jersey town has now become a major scandal for one of the most prominent U.S. politicians. For those of you west of the Poconos, or just with normal lives, here's how the closure of two lanes on a bridge over the Hudson River suddenly became the epicenter of American political news. Governor who? Chris Christie is seen as a rising star in the Republican Party and a possible presidential contender in 2016. He won a second term as governor of Democratic-leaning New Jersey, the 11th-largest U.S. state, in November. He was the keynote speaker at the party's 2012 convention, serves as chairman of the Republican Governors Association and led all other potential GOP contenders in a recent CNN/ORC International poll. Fast facts - who is Chris Christie? So what happened on the bridge? Back in September, two months before Christie's re-election, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey closed two of the three lanes that lead to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, across the Hudson from Manhattan. That caused days of massive traffic jams in Fort Lee, where the Democratic mayor had declined to endorse Christie. The closures were ordered by David Wildstein, a Christie confidante and the governor's appointee to the Port Authority, which operates the nation's busiest bridge. They immediately sparked speculation by Democrats that the action amounted to political retaliation against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich. That led to hearings in New Jersey's state legislature and the December resignations of Wildstein -- who had said the closures were part of a traffic study -- and Bill Baroni, New Jersey's top Port Authority official. Then came Wednesday's revelation that a top Christie aide had e-mailed Wildstein before the closures, telling him, ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" In a lengthy news conference Thursday, Christie announced he had fired the author of that e-mail, deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly, and said he was ""embarrassed and humiliated"" by the ""abject stupidity"" of the move. On the George Washington Bridge: 'Those days ... worse than a disaster' Politics ain't beanbag. What's the big deal? Fort Lee's emergency medical services chief warned at the time that the resulting traffic jams could have life-or-death implications for residents by delaying firefighters and paramedics. He listed several examples, including car wrecks, chest pains and a 91-year-old woman who suffered a heart attack and later died. And politically, several analysts say the scandal endangers any national ambitions Christie may have. ""If a woman died here, he's in deep, deep trouble,"" said David Gergen, a CNN senior political analyst. The former federal prosecutor's combative personality has produced some compelling video clips over the past few years, particularly when confronted with hecklers. Critics call him a bully -- an allegation Christie denied in his news conference Thursday, but one Gergen said the Fort Lee scandal reinforces. ""There's something about this that's so petty and so vindictive ... he's going to have to find some way to defuse this to prove he doesn't run a shop like that,"" Gergen said. Bridge controversy: Traffic snarl delayed EMS, official says . Now what? Investigations and some ""soul searching"" on the part of the governor, who said he was ""blindsided"" by the e-mails. ""I have worked for the last 12 years in public life developing a reputation for honesty and directness and blunt talk, one that I think is well-deserved,"" he said. ""But, you know,  when something like this happens, it is appropriate for you to question yourself. And certainly I am, and I am soul searching on this."" But first, he headed to Fort Lee for a mea culpa -- a personal, ""face-to-face"" apology to Sokolich and the people of his town Thursday afternoon, which Sokolich called ""gracious"" and ""conciliatory."" That may not be the end of it, however. State lawmakers are still holding hearings into the bridge scandal. Wildstein refused to testify before the state General Assembly's Transportation Committee on Thursday afternoon, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. And the U.S. attorney's office in Trenton -- the governor's old post -- says it's looking into whether any federal laws were broken. Both the Port Authority's inspector-general and state Sen. Barbara Buono, Christie's opponent in November, have asked federal authorities to step in. Opinion: Christie's rising star now a target .","New Jersey Gov.

"Some U.S. officials this year are expected to get smartphones capable of handling classified government documents over cellular networks, according to people involved in the project. The phones will run a modified version of Google's Android software, which is being developed as part of an initiative that spans multiple federal agencies and government contractors, these people said. The smartphones are first being deployed to U.S. soldiers, people familiar with the project said. Later, federal agencies are expected to get phones for sending and receiving government cables while away from their offices, sources said. Eventually, local governments and corporations could give workers phones with similar software. The Army has been testing touchscreen devices at U.S. bases for nearly two years, said Michael McCarthy, a director for the Army's Brigade Modernization Command, in a phone interview. About 40 phones were sent to fighters overseas a year ago, and the Army plans to ship 50 more phones and 75 tablets to soldiers abroad in March, he said. ""We've had kind of an accelerated approval process,"" McCarthy said. ""This is a hugely significant event."" Currently, the United States doesn't allow government workers or soldiers to use smartphones for sending classified messages because the devices have not met security certifications. Officials have said they worry that hackers or rogue apps could tap into the commercial version of Android and spill state secrets to foreign governments or to the Web through a publisher such as WikiLeaks. As many as 5 million Android users may have had their phones compromised by a recent virus outbreak rooted in apps found on Google's market, said security software maker Symantec. But with a secure smartphone, a soldier could see fellow infantry on a digital map, or an official could send an important dispatch from Washington's Metro subway without fear of security breaches. Developers in the government program have completed a version that has been authorized for storing classified documents but not transmitting them over a cell network, said two people contributing to the initiative. Smartphones cleared for top-secret dispatches -- high-level classified information that would compromise national security if intercepted -- are expected to be ready in the next few months, they said. Rather than building special handsets hardwired with secure components, the government plans to install its software on commercially available phones, the people familiar with the project said. This approach is far less expensive and allows the government to stay up to date with the latest phones on the market, they said. Android vs. Apple . There are hundreds of different Android models available, and more than half of all smartphones sold globally in a recent quarter use Android, according to industry research firm Gartner. Verizon Wireless has sold more Android phones than any other U.S. cell carrier, thanks in part to its marketing emphasis interest on the Droid brand. About a year ago, Verizon also got the iPhone, ending AT&T's U.S. exclusivity with that device. ""There's a lot of interest in Android,"" Bryan Schromsky, a Verizon director for its wireless data services, said in a phone interview. ""We are seeing Android sales across all branches of government."" Still, Apple's iPhone and iPad are also highly desired among U.S. officials, and people involved in the U.S. smartphone program said their goal is to support any type of smartphone. As CNN has reported, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, uses an iPad to read his classified intelligence by downloading cables and disconnecting from the network. However, the government chose to work on Android first because Google already allows people to tinker freely with its code, said those working on the project. Federal officials have met with Apple, but they were told they could not have access to the core of the company's mobile operating system, said Angelos Stavrou, an information-security director at George Mason University who is working on the government project as a contractor, in a phone interview. ""Android was more cooperative in supporting some of the capabilities that we wanted to support in the operating system, whereas Apple was more averse,"" Stavrou told CNN. ""They're shifting the strategy now."" An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the meeting or any changes to its strategy. Google publishes the source code for Android on its website for anyone to download and modify, and some partners are given access to the code before others. A Google spokesman declined to comment on the government project. When Google releases a new version of Android or when a new version of its phones comes out, a compatible software update to the government's secure Android can be ready within two weeks, Stavrou said. Emphasis on security . Government programmers are making security modifications to Android's kernel, which is the operating system's central component, the people involved said. The version will allow users to choose which data from Android and its applications can be sent over the Internet, they said. ""When you download an application on your phone, you don't really know what it does,"" Stavrou said. ""We test the application in labs before the user consumes that application."" After testing more than 200,000 apps, the researchers discovered that many programs ask for access to far more personal information contained in the phone than they need and, more alarmingly, send some of that superfluous data to the app developers' servers, Stavrou said. Even some well-intentioned features can compromise national security if left unchecked. For example, a weather app may automatically send a phone's GPS coordinates over the Internet to deliver a local forecast, or games may send the device's unique identifier along with a high score. On government phones, officials will be prompted with detailed reports about what data may be sent, and they can decline or allow each transmission, the people involved said. ""People want to play 'Angry Birds,' and we do want our people to be able to download 'Angry Birds,' "" Stavrou said. But he added, ""If a clock application gets your GPS and transmits something over the network, that's not something that we would want to support."" Stavrou, along with seven others at George Mason and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, are developing the smartphone software. They are also consulting with several federal agencies, many within the Department of Defense, he said. He declined to name them. ""The government is actually working pretty hard in getting this technology to most agencies,"" Stavrou said. ""Security is everybody's concern."" A secret project . Officials have not spoken in depth about the project until now. Reuters and some trade publications, including Government Computer News and FedTech Magazine, have previously reported some details. ""We are very cautious about what we release to the public,"" Stavrou said. ""The details of the technology have been something that we have not publicly disclosed."" The project is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the group responsible for early development of GPS and the Internet, Stavrou said. The Defense Department, which houses the agency, has designated the smartphone project as a priority, he said. The National Security Agency has been designated with evaluating the smartphone software for certification, Stavrou said. The NSA gave approval for an earlier version of the system to handle classified data stored on a device, he said. The NSA is also working on a competing system called SE Android, or Security Enhanced Android, Stephen Smalley, a National Security Agency official, wrote this month in a brief e-mail to a group of software developers that was obtained by CNN. SE Android is less flexible in supporting new devices or Android updates from Google and is unlikely to be deployed widely, Stavrou said. An NSA spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail, ""The ultimate goal is to give war fighters, analysts and other intelligence professionals access to classified information on the go -- boosting innovation in the field, efficiency and productivity."" In an unusual move for the federal government, each version of the secure Android operating systems will only need to be certified once before it can be deployed to any U.S. agency, said two people involved in the project. Typically, each agency does its own independent security testing, they said. Also atypical is that the NSA published the source code for SE Android online. The same will be done with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency-funded project. Standardization group OpenSSL Software Foundation is helping with security compliance, said Steve Marquess, a co-founder for the company. The NSA's Smalley announced the first release of SE Android with a two-sentence message two-sentence message on January 6 to a developer mailing list. He concluded by saying, ""Enjoy!"" ""We had to go through many hoops for that to happen,"" Stavrou said of the plan to open-source the software. ""By handing the source code out, other people will be able to take a look and tell us about bugs."" Private interest . Many companies have expressed interest in the government smartphone project, officials said. The corporations that were among the first to adopt the BlackBerry are interested in Android, said Verizon's Schromsky. The Apple spokeswoman also noted that nearly all Fortune 500 companies are testing or have employees using iPhones and iPads. Another obstacle for the government will be to figure out how to secure voice calls, Schromsky said. ""Voice is the immediate need,"" Schromsky said. ""These devices are awesome. They can do so many things, but at the end of the day, I still need to make a voice call."" After the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency project is certified for classified data, developers plan to work on securing the Android system for voice-over IP communications using apps such as Skype, Stavrou said.","Government, military officials to get Android phones capable of sharing secret documents .

"If you get arrested in California, the photos, e-mails and other personal data on your cell phone soon could be a bit safer from prying police eyes soon. A bill passed by the state legislature would require law-enforcement officers to obtain a warrant before searching the cell phone of a person placed under arrest. If signed by the governor, the bill would override a January ruling by the California Supreme Court. According to California Sen. Mark Leno, who sponsored the legislation, this ruling had ""legalized the warrantless search of cell phones during an arrest, regardless of whether the information on the phone is relevant to the arrest or if criminal charges are ever filed."" The new California law unanimously passed in the state Assembly. Gov. Jerry Brown has until October 9 to sign it into law, according to a spokesman from the governor's office. Under this legislation, California law enforcement officers would have to first obtain a search warrant when there is probable cause to believe a suspect's portable electronic device contains evidence of a crime. The Peace Officers Research Association of California, which opposed the bill, argued: ""Restricting the authority of a peace officer to search an arrestee unduly restricts their ability to apply the law, fight crime, discover evidence valuable to an investigation and protect the citizens of California."" The California legislature disagreed, finding that ""once in the exclusive control of the police, cellular telephones do not ordinarily pose a threat to officer safety."" Furthermore, lawmakers found that existing practices -- including confiscating the phone (without searching it) or promptly applying to a judge for a search warrant -- alleviate concerns about destruction of evidence. This isn't just about cell phones. The wording of this law specifically refers to ""portable electronic devices,"" defined as: ""any portable device that is capable of creating, receiving, accessing, or storing electronic data or communications."" So in addition to cell phones this might conceivably cover tablet computers, laptops, netbooks, e-readers, media players, gaming devices, digital cameras, audio recorders, external hard drives, flash drives and other devices available now or in the future. The new law can strengthen the rights to freedom of speech and assembly in California. The prior court ruling -- though aimed mainly at gathering evidence about criminal activity such as drug deals or prostitution -- also could be used by police to gain intelligence about the identities or activities of people at protests or other public or private gatherings. Hanni Fakhoury, staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, explained why law-abiding citizens should worry about warrantless cell phone searches. ""It's really easy to pick on people who have been arrested and charged with crimes. But that subset could get expanded to cover everyone. Also, an arrest is not the same as a conviction."" The new law also strengthens California's protections for journalists and their sources, according to the California Newspaper Publishers Association. The state's ""shield law,"" which prohibits the state or other litigants from subpoenaing reporters' unpublished notes or other sensitive information related to their work. Many reporters keep such information on their cell phones and other devices, and it's not unheard of for journalists to get arrested in California. Fakhoury noted that once police do obtain a warrant to search an arrestee's phone or other portable electronic device, it's possible that everything on that device might become fair game for law enforcement or prosecution. ""If they have a search warrant, depending on its scope, it might be tough to restrict what information on phones they get and how they use it,"" he said. ""Courts are divided on this. They recognize that there must be limits to searches -- but they also know that incriminating evidence can be anywhere, and it's likely to be hidden."" In recent months the issue of warrantless cell phone searches has arisen in several states with varying results. For instance, the Ohio Supreme Court barred warrantless cell phone searches, but lower courts in Georgia and Florida have upheld such searches. And in May the Oregon Supreme Court declined to hear the case of James Tyler Nix, which could have disallowed warrantless cell phone searches in that state. Fakhoury of EFF believes that California's new law sends a strong message to other courts and legislatures around the U.S. -- including the U.S. Supreme Court. ""I certainly see this issue ending up in the U.S. Supreme Court at some point,"" said Fakhoury. ""None of the cases involved relied solely on state law. They all raised constitutional issues. There would be no reason for the Supreme Court not to get involved.""","New law would override a January ruling by the California Supreme Court .

"Sudan has withdrawn its soldiers from Abyei, a disputed border region also claimed by South Sudan, but has left police officers, the United Nations peacekeeping mission said Wednesday. ""The mission has confirmed the full withdrawal of the SAF from Abyei area yesterday,"" said Josephine Guerrero, a spokeswoman for the U.N.'s Department of Peacekeeping Operations in New York, referring to the Sudan Armed Forces. ""Armed police forces are still in the area."" South Sudan's army spokesman, Philip Aguer, said he is ""skeptical"" that Sudan has truly pulled troops out. He said he had received reports that the Sudan Armed Forces left two platoons of soldiers dressed in police uniforms in Abyei town, and that two battalions remain about 40 miles away in Diffra, which is the only oil field inside the disputed territory. ""We have our reservations about Sudan's claims that it withdrew from Abyei,"" he said, adding that his government is investigating reports that Sudanese soldiers remain in the area. The conflicting claims come on the second day of renewed peace talks between Sudan and South Sudan, which are being hosted by the African Union in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. Talks have been ongoing since the South declared independence on July 9 of last year, but Sudan pulled out of negotiations last month as border clashes brought the countries to the brink of war. A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted this month threatened sanctions if the countries refused to cease hostilities and return to talks. South Sudan complied with the Security Council's demand that it withdraw forces from the contested, oil-rich area of Heglig, as well as police it had stationed in Abyei. The resolution also required Sudan to withdraw its forces from Abyei. The United Nations and the African Union have made repeated requests that Sudan withdraw troops after it invaded Abyei a year ago. More than 100,000 people remain displaced, according to the World Food Program, which is supporting the displaced community in the South Sudanese town of Agok. Under a 2005 peace agreement that ended Sudan's two-decade civil war, Abyei residents were to take part in a referendum on whether to join the South or remain a special administrative region within Sudan. The vote was to take place in January 2011, at the same time as the referendum that led to South Sudan's secession. But disputes over who was eligible to vote prevented the referendum from going forward in Abyei. In a 2009 ruling, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague placed Abyei's boundaries around the traditional homeland of the Ngok Dinka tribe. Those borders excluded most of the oil fields in the area as well as the members of the Misseriya tribe, who often receive support from Khartoum, Sudan's capital. The nomads spend part of the year grazing their cattle in Abyei and said they should also be able to vote. The U.N. Security Council and the African Union have given Sudan and South Sudan three months to resolve post-secession issues, including the fate of Abyei. Other points of contention are citizenship for people from both countries who now find themselves living in either country, border demarcation and oil revenue sharing. With independence, South Sudan acquired three-quarters of the formerly united country's oil reserves. But the new nation depends on pipelines and processing facilities that remain in Sudan. Negotiators have failed to agree on how much the landlocked South should pay to use those facilities. South Sudan halted oil production in late January after accusing Sudan of stealing $815 million worth of its crude. Sudan said it had confiscated the oil to make up for unpaid fees.","The U.N. has called for Sudan and South Sudan to withdraw forces from Abyei .

"Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo find themselves fighting it out for FIFA's Ballon d'Or award once again -- but the contest between the world's two highest-profile footballers isn't only being played out on the pitch. Bayern Munich's German international goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was the other player on the three-man shortlist revealed Monday, with Ronaldo the overwhelming favorite to take the award. Which means there is no sign of Barcelona's Messi and Real Madrid poster boy Ronaldo's domination of the back pages ending any time soon. Both are so globally known that that their every Facebook posting is worth thousands of dollars for brands associated with the two players, while the allure of their names helps shift any and every product with which they are associated. But who is the most marketable? Is it Messi, the newly-crowned all-time La Liga top scorer? Or is it Ronaldo, the current Ballon d'Or holder and a man seemingly able to score goals at will, no matter what the competition? Sports marketing research company Repucom examined 15 different markets, ranging from Spain to the U.S., and found that Portugal skipper Ronaldo is the better-known of the two: 92% know of him, while 87% have heard of Messi. The figures also show that the same number of men know about Messi as women know about Ronaldo -- 91%. They reveal that Ronaldo sells more effectively, with 86% of those questioned regarding the ex-Manchester United man as ""an influential brand spokesman."" ""Cristiano Ronaldo dominates in terms of his overall marketability -- largely because of the consistently high levels of awareness people have of him around the world, whilst Messi has a greater proportion of people that do know of him saying they like him,"" said Repucom's global head of research Mike Wragg. That, Repucom says, makes the Real star the most marketable footballer in the world. One leading academic believes Ronaldo's increasingly growing ""brand"" off the pitch is testament to the way his management team have ""packaged him as a formal business proposition"" in contrast to Messi. ""There is a clear and deliberate strategic intent on the part of the Ronaldo and his business representatives,"" Simon Chadwick, Professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at England's Coventry University, told CNN. ""The intention has been to create and position a brand that provides consumers with a differential advantage over its rivals. ""We've seen the development of the CR7 brand, which Ronaldo has used as the basis for the development of his commercial activities."" Whereas Messi was always viewed by many as the ultimate team player, there has also been a shift in the way Ronaldo is now presented to his audience, says Chadwick. ""From a man who has historically been perceived as being self-centered and arrogant, recently Ronaldo's image has softened as the result of him paying for the medical treatment of a sick fan -- a young child. ""Remember too that Ronaldo had his hair cut in a particular way to mark his relationship with the boy. Those actions have helped in shaping and fashioning the latest incarnation of the Ronaldo brand."" The data also shows that Ronaldo's online clout is higher than Messi's. The Real forward boasts more than 102 million Facebook followers, with Repucom calculating his average Facebook post value in 2014 to be worth $143,750. Messi, on the other hand, has 75 million Facebook fans and average post value of $62,500. Are we likely to see Messi being marketed in a different way in the coming years? ""I'm not convinced that Messi or his advisors want this,"" said Chadwick. ""I think he's simply happy to play football and pick up some additional commercial income along the way."" The academic argues there are complications in trying to come up with a compelling ""brand proposition"" for the Argentine star. ""Five years years ago his brand was something akin to childlike innocence, someone who plays football for the joy of it. but now he has a child he is, therefore, not a child any more. ""And his tax case means that the brand may be perceived as not being innocent any more. ""One way for him to position the Messi 'brand' might be as a 'family man'; but given that he is not married, this may not play out well among some market segments. Meanwhile, back in the footballing arena, the statistics are more reassuring for Messi -- even more so given he is two years younger than the 29-year-old Ronaldo. The Camp Nou talisman is La Liga's goals record-holder, with 253 strikes to his name, while Ronaldo has 197. He is also the leading scorer in the Champions League, with 74 goals -- a record held jointly with Raul and only one ahead of Ronaldo's tally of 71. And Messi also has the greatest number of Ballon d'Or awards -- four -- with his Real Madrid rival having taken the accolade twice. Ronaldo is Portugal's leading all-time goalscorer with 52, while Messi and Gabriel Batistuta share the record of most goals scored in a year for Argentina, each striking 12 times. Messi has hit 44 goals in 95 games for his country overall. So these stars will fight it out for the Ballon D'Or award, unless Manuel Neuer spoils the party.","Globe's highest-profile players set to fight for Ballon d'Or .

"Russia and Ukraine faced off again Saturday, far from their volatile border region, on the glitzy stage of the Eurovision Song Contest. Tensions between the neighbors gave an added piquancy to the competition's grand final in Copenhagen, Denmark, in which both nations were fielding entries. Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in March and eastern Ukraine is currently roiled by pro-Russian separatist protests. On the night, however, it was a much talked about 25-year-old from Austria who stole the show. Conchita Wurst, the onstage drag persona of Thomas Neuwirth, was the runaway winner for a performance of the ballad ""Rise Like A Phoenix."" Wurst also refers to himself as ""the bearded lady,"" he says on his website. In his private life, he calls himself ""Tom"" and refers to himself as ""he."" In the role of Conchita Wurst, who Neuwirth calls an ""art figure,"" the artist refers to ""herself"" as ""she."" Neuwirth created Wurst -- which in German means sausage but can also mean 'who cares?' -- in his teen years to cope with feeling discriminated against. Performing in a skintight dress with long hair and a full beard, Wurst scored 290 points to become Austria's first Eurovision winner since 1966. ""For me, my dream came true,"" Wurst told reporters after the contest. ""But for society it showed me that people want to move on, to look to the future. We said something, we made a statement."" Wurst's presence in the competition had proved controversial in some countries. In Armenia, Belarus and Russia -- where a law against ""gay propaganda"" was passed last year -- petitions were circulated calling for the singer to be removed from the competition or edited out of the broadcast. In Russia, Wurst's win drew boos in some places where audiences had gathered to watch the contest. Wurst's manager, Rene Berto, described the win as a victory for tolerance, one of the main themes emphasized by the contest's organizers. ""Let's change the world and make it a little bit better,"" Berto said. ""Conchita always says: 'Wish for the moon and you'll reach at least the stars,' but now we just landed on the moon. Let's change our way of thinking -- Conchita is just a woman with a beard."" Non-political event? Created in the aftermath of World War II  to encourage good relations between neighbors, Eurovision has been held every year since 1956, and today draws a television audience of about 180 million people in 45 countries. Contestants are often eccentric, colorful, unusual -- on the fringes of mainstream music in their home countries. The organizers describe the event -- known for its combination of over-the-top costumes, kitsch pop songs and sometimes questionable talent -- as non-political. But in reality, politics inevitably colors both the voting and the performances. This was demonstrated to an unusual degree Tuesday, when Russia's entrants -- 17-year-old twins Anastasia and Maria Tolmachevy -- were booed by the audience during their semi-final performance. William Lee Adams, a Eurovision expert and the editor-in-chief of Wiwibloggs.com, the popular Eurovision website, told CNN that the contest is about national identity as well as music. ""Months of frustration over Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and Putin's anti-LGBT laws have left Europeans angry,"" Adams said. ""The booing was a release, a statement of solidarity with Ukraine and Russia's sexual minorities."" It doesn't help that Russia's love song features lyrics that some see as hinting at a border incursion. It goes, ""...living on the edge, closer to the crime, cross the line, one step at a time ... maybe there's a day you'll be mine."" Ukrainian singer Mariya Yaremchuk, who performed a song titled ""Tick-Tock,"" said Tuesday that she was proud to be representing her country. ""Actually, my main position is that I'm proud that I'm Ukrainian and everything I do here is for the Ukrainian people,"" the 21-year-old said. ""I'm not standing alone on the stage, there are 46 million Ukrainians behind me on the stage."" The countries involved in the contest award a set of points from one to eight, then 10 and finally 12 for their favorite songs. They can't vote for themselves and they must announce the score in both English and French. Television viewers can cast votes in their respective countries through telephone hotlines, which count for half the final tally. The remainder of the vote is cast by national expert juries. The country with the highest points total wins -- and has the rather expensive honor of hosting the following year's event. In the end, Ukraine's Yaremchuk scored slightly higher than her Russian rivals, finishing in sixth place with 113 points, while Russia's Tolmachevy twins took 89 points to finish seventh. A duo from the Netherlands finished in second place, with a Swedish entry coming in third.","Austria's Conchita Wurst wins Eurovision Song Contest 2014 in Copenhagen .

"""This is the silliest thing I've done in my life,"" Ann says as she emerges from her tent. ""I should have done it when I was much younger."" ""Tomorrow you'll think it was worth the effort,"" Maria responds. It's a bitterly cold night in January. I'm at Barafu Camp on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, with Ann Austen, a 69-year-old New Yorker and Maria Nielson, 55, from Sweden. In the midnight darkness I watch them join a line of 200 headlamps, slowly ascending the last slope to reach the highest point in Africa -- 5,895 meters (19,340 feet) above sea level. (Kilimanjaro's official elevation is the subject of dispute -- the preceding figures are the most commonly cited.) But I'm waiting. I'd learned from a local that while most groups trek to the summit overnight, hundreds at a time, to catch the sunrise from the top, the best time to climb is around 10 a.m. when the crowds, and the clouds, clear. ""I know the mountain, this is my mountain,"" Sifael Malle tells me. It's a good decision. We're alone on Uhuru Peak, the highest point on Kibo crater, one of the three volcanic cones that comprise the mountain. Three champagne corks are the only sign that others had been here earlier. Without Malle's local knowledge, however, it could have been different. Tourism impact . The Overseas Development Institute (ODI), a British think tank, estimates that every year 40,000 people attempt to climb Kilimanjaro, bringing with them tons of waste and other environmental threats, including water contamination and soil erosion. The crowds threaten the beauty of the place, which cultural narratives depict as a symbol of solitude and peace. The glaciers are disappearing, changing the face of Kilimanjaro. Local porters are often underpaid and climb without adequate equipment. Hearing these stories, I'm skeptical about the place -- other destinations are described as ""purer"" natural experiences. However, I soon discover that much has changed since the days of horrific reports of camps among open-air latrines, trash littering the landscape and congested trails. I find a clean mountain, with toilets at camps and along the routes. The environmental challenges are significant but the initiatives implemented by the Tanzania National Parks Authority seem to be paying off. The ODI calculated in 2009 that tourists spend just less than $50 million per year around the Kili experience. Some 28%, $13 million, is considered to directly benefit the poor. The ODI says this is the most successful transfer of resources from international tourists to impoverished locals they've witnessed. The local view . Take, for instance, my local guide. Malle comes from a poor farming family that lived by a road used by tourists. In previous years, he'd rush toward the jeeps that drove by, hoping to receive gifts. ""We dreamed of owning those cars,"" he told me. ""But the reality is poverty, few jobs, often unstable and underpaid. ""The dreams get easily forgotten. I tried to keep mine: to live a better life, to start my own business and to be able to support others. ""I begged guides to take me on the mountain, even for free. They told me I was too thin, incapable of carrying the weight. ""They asked for my climbing equipment, and laughed as I did not have any. I persisted and found a guide who employed me."" Malle became a porter in 1999. He went back to school to study tour guiding and botany. In 2006, he passed the government examination and became a licensed guide. ""I soon thought that with my experience of the mountain I could be a better tour operator, as most of the existing ones have never been on the mountain."" He set up us his own company. ""I sent hundreds of messages to people announcing my new company, and gradually people started to respond."" Kili Base Adventure was born. Kilimanjaro is offering entrepreneurial opportunities that were impossible a decade ago. Conquest vs. experience . The highlight of a Kilimanjaro experience, in my view, isn't reaching the top. A simple, aimless wander on a mountain trail might not seem to have the drama of a summit ascent. But mountains are regarded as spiritual places by many cultures, not least for their natural attributes. This view is especially evident on Kilimanjaro as climbers venture through five ecosystems in the space of few kilometers. At the base is a dense rainforest. It ends abruptly at 3,000 meters, giving way to alpine heathland, abundant with giant heathers. Further up the weather changes -- low clouds envelop the slopes, which become covered with tussock grass and sporadic giant lobelias. Here the greens are less vibrant but more varied than in the brighter forest below. I count 12 shades of verdant green in a three-meter radius from where I stand. Above 4,000 meters is the highland desert: gravel, stones, rocks and cliffs. A place for ascetics. Finally you climb into an arctic-like zone, with permanent snow and the glaciers that may soon disappear. Clean climb . Does Kilimanjaro deserve its reputation as a crowded mountain with long lines of tourists spoiling the atmosphere of solitude? I found the opposite to be true. Throughout my climb the trails were empty and, on the summit, I was alone. My secret, of course, was the local knowledge provided by Malle and tailor-making my own climb. The tourism industry sells standardized packages: everyone follows the same route, does the same thing, walks at the same time. I didn't -- my sense of satisfaction came from the connection with the spirit of a beautiful and legendary place. End of March to early June is low season around Kilimanjaro, often marked by heavy rains. January, February, August and September are the busiest months.","Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, was once plagued by ecological problems, a result of tourism .

"(CNN) -- Investigators combed through Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's history Sunday in hopes of learning how the British-educated son of a Nigerian bank executive ended up carrying what authorities said was a bomb onto a Michigan-bound jetliner. Abdulmutallab was released from a hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on Sunday after being treated for burns, according to Gina Balaya, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Detroit, Michigan. The 23-year-old is charged with attempting to set off an explosive device aboard a Northwest Airlines flight from the Netherlands shortly before its landing in Detroit on Christmas Day, and was being held in an undisclosed location, Balaya told CNN. Meanwhile, investigators were trying to retrace Abdulmutallab's steps halfway across the globe, from the Arabian peninsula to West Africa to Britain. Abdulmutallab claimed to have extremist ties and said the explosive device -- made from a plastic explosive known as PETN -- ""was acquired in Yemen along with instructions as to when it should be used,"" according to a federal security bulletin. A source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN Sunday that the amount of explosive was sufficient to blow a hole in the side of the aircraft. U.S. intelligence warns that the al Qaeda terrorist network has established a foothold in Yemen, the ancestral homeland of its founder, Osama bin Laden, where government troops are now battling both al Qaeda operatives and a Shiite Muslim separatist movement. In Britain, where the suspect studied engineering at a London university, police spent a second day searching his last known apartment. Bombings by home-grown Muslim radicals killed 52 people in London in 2005. ""This man had been in London, where there is frequent evidence of recruitment by al Qaeda, al Qaeda-related people,"" said John McLaughlin, the former deputy director of the CIA, now a CNN analyst. ""He claims to have been in touch with Yemenis, and Yemen is a place where al Qaeda is on the move."" Detectives with Scotland Yard's anti-terrorism branch spent part of Sunday interviewing Michael Rimmer, a former high school teacher who described Abdulmutallab as a ""very devout"" Muslim who had once expressed sympathy for Afghanistan's Taliban insurgency during a classroom discussion. But Rimmer, who taught Abdulmutallab at a school in the West African nation of Togo, said it was not clear whether the then-teenager was simply playing devil's advocate during the class. The site of the London search was a basement apartment in an ornate building in a wealthy neighborhood. Abdulmutallab returned to London in May, and received a tourist visa from the U.S. Embassy there that he used to fly to Detroit from the Nigerian commercial capital of Lagos via Amsterdam, the Netherlands. A family source said Abdulmutallab received a college degree at University College London, where spokesman Dave Weston said a man named Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab was enrolled in the Mechanical Engineering Department between September 2005 and June 2008. He then went to Dubai, the UAE's financial hub, around January 2009 to study for a masters degree in international business. A U.S. official said Saturday that Abdulmutallab's father contacted the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria several weeks ago to report that his son had ""become radicalized."" The father, Umaru Abdulmutallab, told the embassy the family feared his son had gone to Yemen to participate in ""some kind of jihad,"" the family source said. The source told CNN that Abdulmutallab's father -- who recently retired as chairman of First Bank PLC, one of Nigeria's premier banks -- had his concerns raised by a text message from his son. But a senior Obama administration official with knowledge of the case said the father's call amounted to little more than a ""missing person report."" The official, who could not speak on the record because of the sensitive nature of the information, said the elder Abdulmutallab was deemed credible as a source, but did not have enough specific information to justify canceling his son's U.S. visa or putting him on a ""no-fly"" list. ""If we pulled his visa or banned him from flying, that would have alerted him you are onto him,"" the official said. ""Whereas in some cases if you have a terror lead, you watch to see what happens when he travels, which could be more valuable."" In addition, the official said, it was ""fairly early in the process of what kind of threat this guy poses."" The father's information was vetted and a determination on how to proceed was made through a U.S. inter-agency process, and a file was opened on Abdulmutallab about five weeks ago. But the official added, ""One part of the system that absolutely failed"" was that Abdulmutallab was able to board a plane to the United States allegedly with PETN. Abdulmutallab first boarded a KLM flight from Lagos, Nigeria, to Amsterdam. Both Nigerian authorities and KLM, a Northwest partner, say he received secondary security screening. But a U.S. official said Friday that Abdulmutallab was not checked for traces of explosives using a more extensive test. CNN's Jason Morris, Elise Labott and Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.","Accused terrorist Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab treated for burns, released Sunday .

"When you think about pumpkins, what comes to mind? Jack-o'-lanterns? Pumpkin pie? Charlie Brown? Pumpkin spice lattes? Well, there's more to these orange gourds than Halloween and sugary (but delicious!) desserts and drinks. Pumpkins have numerous health benefits -- none of which take center stage in autumn's most frequent offerings. Why you crave pumpkin flavors in the fall . Are you skeptical about taking the pumpkin out of the pie (or cup)? These health benefits may change your mind: . Weight loss . Pumpkin is rich in fiber, which slows digestion. ""Pumpkin keeps you feeling fuller longer,"" says Caroline Kaufman, MS, RDN and an upwave diet and nutrition expert. ""There's seven grams of fiber in a cup of canned pumpkin. That's more than what you'd get in two slices of whole-grain bread."" Pumpkin may be filling, but it's also a low-calorie superstar. ""Canned pumpkin is nearly 90 percent water, so besides the fact that it helps keep you hydrated, it has fewer than 50 calories per serving,"" Kaufman says. The 10 most filling foods for weight loss . Sharper vision . Pumpkin's brilliant orange coloring comes from its ample supply of beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A in the body. Vitamin A is essential for eye health and helps the retina absorb and process light. A single cup of pumpkin contains over 200 percent of most people's recommended daily intake of vitamin A, making it an outstanding option for optical health. Pumpkin also contains lutein and zeaxanthin, two antioxidants that are thought to help prevent cataracts and may even slow the development of macular degeneration. Healthy food for your eyes . Better immunity . Looking for a way to ward off illness and improve your immune system? Try pumpkin. The large shot of vitamin A the fruit provides helps your body fight infections, viruses and infectious diseases. Pumpkin oil even helps fight various bacterial and fungal infections. Plus, pumpkin is packed with nearly 20 percent of the recommended amount of daily vitamin C, which may help you recover from colds faster. 11 easy immune boosters for cold and flu season . Younger-looking skin .

"The urban jungle of greater Los Angeles is wrangling with a mystery caught on video: Just what kind of beast is lurking in the pre-dawn darkness? So far, authorities have ruled out a mountain lion. But could it be an African lion, just 25 miles outside downtown Los Angeles, in the suburb of Norwalk? Or, as some wiseacres assert on Norwalk's Facebook page, could it be the mythic chupacabra, the dreaded ""goat sucker"" fabled in Latin America? Norwalk city officials are taking the matter seriously -- that a mysterious animal has been on the loose since it was last seen on July 29 just before 4 a.m., according to a time stamp on the video. Officials are calling it ""a large wild cat,"" the city's website says. A residential surveillance video shows what appears to be an aged lion with a long, curving tail. It saunters behind a parked vehicle and then appears in an illuminated area, clearly showing an overall image of the animal. A resident mistakenly reported it as a ""mountain lion,"" city officials said. ""Animal was not aggressive -- moves slowly as if aged,"" city officials said on their Facebook page. The California ""Department of Fish and Wildlife confirmed that the large cat-like animal captured on surveillance video is NOT a mountain lion,"" city officials added. ""Department officials still cannot definitively identify the type of animal. They will continue to investigate."" Beneath that notice was one comment that described an uneasy city: ""Don't know what's scarier, that it was a mountain lion, or that 'Department officials still cannot definitively identify the type of animal.' "" Police and sheriff's deputies have stepped up their patrols in Norwalk, located among a knot of smaller cities southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Authorities are providing information to residents on what to do if they see the animal. The neighborhood where the big animal was sighted is at least 20 miles from typical foothill habitat for mountain lions and is near the junction of Interstate Highways 5 and 605, CNN affiliate KTLA said. One lion expert told The Los Angeles Times that the animal appeared to be an African lion, but another expert told the newspaper that he thought it was a leopard. The video appears to distort the size of the animal, which could be no more than 2 feet high, the height of a sign that it passes, state game warden Don Nelson told the newspaper. ""It appears, in my opinion, to look like a dog, maybe an older pit bull mix,"" Nelson said in an interview with KTLA. But he said ""anything is possible."" In the meantime, area residents continue to speculate. ""Proportions aren't correct for an African lion or cheetah, but it's definitely a big cat,"" one woman posted on Norwalk's Facebook page. ""By the large size of the head and thickness of the body, I'd say this animal is a young adult jaguar. They've been trying to re-establish themselves in the Southwest for some time.""

"The Caribbean doesn't seem like the ideal place for a vacation during hurricane season, yet many travelers take the gamble and book a cruise to the region anyway. It's a trip that can can go very smoothly or offer some unpleasant surprises, anything from sudden itinerary changes to passengers being left behind when weather conditions change. Consider Hurricane Irene, which forced many ships to change course last week. Now, here comes Tropical Storm Katia. So what should cruise aficionados consider when booking a summer or fall Caribbean voyage? We asked Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor in chief of CruiseCritic.com, to explain some of the realities of cruising when the big storms are most likely to form. Why do people choose to cruise in the Caribbean during hurricane season? There are several compelling reasons. First, hurricane season in the Atlantic lasts a long time -- from June 1 to November 30 -- and it includes the summer, when school is out and many people are looking to get away with their kids. So it's not realistic to think vacationers will skip the beautiful region for six months, Brown said. Second, it's a great time for deals. ""It's the cheapest time to cruise, and for a lot of people, that's worth the risk,"" Brown said. Third, it's unlikely most travelers will be caught in a storm. If a hurricane forms, cruise ships have sophisticated weather tracking systems and can keep their distance from any rough weather. ""Ships can move. Unlike an island resort, which pretty much has to sit there and take it, ships move out of the way of the hurricane,"" Brown said. When Hurricane Irene blew through the Caribbean last week, more than 20 ships changed their itineraries to avoid the storm.  Which leads to the next question: . Aren't cruise ships obligated to stick to their published itinerary? You may be surprised that the answer is no. ""It's in the contract of carriage when you buy your ticket that they can go anywhere they want. You can buy an eastern Caribbean cruise, and they can go to the western Caribbean, and they don't have to give you a cent in compensation for that,"" Brown said. She recalled a 2005 incident in which a Royal Caribbean cruise ship was supposed to sail from New Jersey to Bermuda but changed course to New England and Canada at the last minute because of an approaching tropical storm. The passengers, who weren't prepared for the colder climate, were furious, Brown said. Love 'em or hate 'em? Cruises divide travelers . Rough weather isn't the only reason that cruise ships change itineraries. This year, dozens of cruises had to be ""reset"" during the political unrest in parts of North Africa and the Middle East. What happens if you miss your cruise because of a canceled flight to the port city or because the ship leaves early to escape the path of the storm? Things can get tricky. If you buy an air/sea package -- or purchase the flight as part of the voyage -- the cruise line will put you up in a hotel and help you get to the next port. Otherwise, it's not obligated to do anything, Brown said. Consider what happened August 21 as Hurricane Irene was getting closer to Puerto Rico. Port officials in San Juan ordered Royal Caribbean and Carnival ships to depart several hours early, even though not all the passengers had arrived, CruiseCritic.com reported. There was no way to notify guests of the three-hour change in departure time, Royal Caribbean said in a statement, so 145 of the passengers booked on the Serenade of the Seas were left behind. The 15 people who reserved their air travel with Royal Caribbean were provided hotel accommodations in San Juan as well as a flight to Aruba the next day so they could join the ship. The rest -- or ""independent guests"" -- were advised of hotel availability in San Juan, but the expense was their responsibility since it was a weather-related event, said Cynthia Martinez, a Royal Caribbean spokeswoman. ""That took my breath away. That was the worst display of customer service I have ever seen in the cruise industry,"" Brown said. She pointed out that when faced with the same situation, Carnival tried to reach out to all of its passengers, arranged for hotel stays and booked flights to Barbados for those who wanted to meet the ship there. It also paid for the expenses or offered refunds in the form of future cruise credits. The incident generated 700 comments on CruiseCritic's message board, most of them expressing horror at what happened, Brown said. Still, she doesn't recommend buying air/sea packages from a cruise line to feel safe, because air travel booked this way is often more expensive and less flexible than booking your own flight. Buy travel insurance instead -- more on that later. Do cruise lines ever cancel cruises? Very rarely, because they can ""make lemonade out of lemons"" -- or change the order of port calls or go to another destination, Brown said. ""We monitor the storms closely and make strategic changes to the itineraries to keep them away from the storm,"" said Jennifer de la Cruz, a Carnival spokeswoman, during Hurricane Irene. ""The nice thing ... is that there are a lot of destinations in the Caribbean, so we have lots of options."" What should you do to keep a hurricane from ruining your cruise? Buy travel insurance with weather protection, but not necessarily from the cruise line, Brown said. Ask your travel agent for help, or shop around for a good policy. If you're cruising during hurricane season, get to the departure city a day early so you don't have to worry about missing the ship. ""Don't tempt fate,"" Brown said. If there is a storm that could affect the region you're cruising in, stay close to your ship in case it needs to depart early. Don't go off on a three-hour trip by yourself, Brown said. Many people plan marriage ceremonies in scenic port stops, like Grand Cayman or St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Be very careful about doing that during hurricane season. ""You can plan this beautiful wedding for yourself on the Wednesday that you're there, but if a hurricane comes and you don't go there, you're out of luck,"" Brown said.","Rough weather is possible, but ships usually move out of the way of a storm .
Cruise ships are not obligated to stick to their published itinerary .
Cruise lines took different approaches when guests were left behind before Irene .
Expert: Buy travel insurance; stay close to the ship if a storm is approaching ."
"Clint Dempsey may have scored the go-ahead goal for the United States in what would ultimately be a gut-wrenching tie with Portugal in Sunday's World Cup game. But on social media, Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo was three times as popular as the American striker. Ronaldo, considered the best soccer player in the world by some, was mentioned on Twitter 1.5 million times during the United States-Portugal match, compared to 465,000 mentions for Dempsey. Of course, the word ""popular"" is probably relative to most Americans, after Ronaldo lobbed a perfect crossing pass to help create the last-minute goal that prevented the U.S. from advancing to the Cup's next round, at least for now. ""I feel like someone (@Cristiano) just punched me and my babies in the gut!"" New York Jets placekicker Nick Folk wrote. ""What a match. 30 seconds away from advancing! Still, we control our own destiny... #IBelieve,"" tweeted pop star Justin Timberlake. Sunday's match was a high point in a World Cup that's already shattering social-media records. Facebook says 10 million people had 20 million interactions during the U.S.-Portugal match. According to Twitter Data, there were 8 million tweets about the match while it was happening. By itself, that's no match for the 24.9 million tweets during this year's Super Bowl (including pregame, halftime and postgame). But, taken as a whole, the World Cup, bolstered by its massive international appeal and growing popularity in the U.S., is becoming the biggest social-media event in the medium's short history. The Cup's opening match, between host country Brazil and Croatia, spurred 12.2 million tweets alone -- possibly not surprising when you consider that soccer-crazy Brazil has the fifth-most Twitter users in the world, behind the  United States, United  Kingdom, Canada and Australia. The tournament's first week, June 12 to 18, spurred 459 million posts, likes and comments on Facebook, according to the company. Compare that to 185 million interactions about the Super Bowl, 120 million for the Sochi Winter Olympics and 25.4 million for the Academy Awards in March, and you realize the World Cup inspired more activity than the other three combined. ""Sporting events always drive a massive amount of conversation on Facebook, but what we've seen so far during the World Cup has been extraordinary,"" a Facebook spokesman said in an e-mail. ""Facebook and the World Cup are both fundamentally global, and we knew that Facebook would become a global, mobile stadium where people connect and engage during the tournament. It turned out to be a unique moment for us, and one that has seen the highest level of conversation for any event Facebook has ever measured."" Both Facebook and Twitter saw the deluge of soccer-related activity coming and launched tools to  encourage it. In addition to letting users choose their favorite nation's flag as their avatar, Twitter has created a dedicated #WorldCup feed featuring tweets from selected clubs, media outlets, players and even FIFA, the international soccer governing body. It has also added ""hashflags."" When a user tweets the hashtag for a World Cup team -- #USA or #MEX, for example -- the nation's flag will appear as an image beside it. Faceook has created a similar one-stop home for the tournament, Trending World Cup. In addition to top posts, your friends' updates about the World Cup also will appear in the feed.","Sunday's U.S.-Portugal World Cup match inspired big social media activity .

"If you've got it, don't flaunt it -- at least not on the Spanish resort island of Mallorca, where citizens are so sick of under dressed tourists that fines could soon be issued for inappropriate attire. A proposed new law, reportedly close to being enacted, will ban the wearing of swimwear outside bathing areas in the island's capital, Palma. Officials say they're happy for visitors to let it all hang out on the beach, but when it comes to wandering around town, semi-nudity is a no-no. ""I do not know of any upscale resort town that allows this practice,"" Alvaro Gijon, deputy mayor of Palma, reportedly told a recent press conference. The proposed crackdown is part of a wider set of measures aimed at tackling what is seen as anti-social behavior on the island, a popular package destination for north Europeans. No specific penalties have been detailed in Palma City Council's ""Ordenanza Civica"" -- also known as the ""good citizen plan."" 'Devoid of superior clothing' However, the UK's Daily Mail newspaper expressed concerns that what some media outlets called a ""bikini ban"" could leave unsuspecting travelers facing fines in excess of $800. Its readers seemed less concerned, with some commenting that they'd welcome a cover-up. One of them, Calagran, commented: ""I've lived on Mallorca for the past 11 years and it makes my skin crawl when I have to stand behind some fat sweaty individual in the supermarket who thinks it's OK to let it all hang out."" Under a section titled ""etiquette,"" the Ordenanza states that it'll be forbidden for anyone to be ""naked or nude"" in public places or ""devoid of superior clothing."" Unlike an ill-fitting pair of Speedos, there is some room for maneuver, however. The proposed prohibition doesn't apply to boardwalks or streets adjacent to the beach -- so there's no need to dress up when dashing for an ice cream.","Proposed new law will ban the wearing of swimwear outside of bathing areas in Mallorcan capital Palma .

"(CNN) -- Police say guilt was written all over their faces. Police received a call Friday night that two men with hooded sweatshirts and painted faces had tried to break into a man's home in Carroll, Iowa. When police stopped a vehicle matching the caller's description blocks away, they were stunned by the men's disguises. There were no ski masks or stockings pulled over their heads; instead, Matthew Allan McNelly, 23, and Joey Lee Miller, 20, streaked their faces with permanent black marker. Carroll Police Chief Cayler told CNN the strange disguises made it easier for his officers. ""We're very skilled investigators and the black faces gave them right away,"" Cayler said jokingly. ""I have to assume the officers were kind of laughing at the time. I've never heard of coloring your face with a permanent marker."" Cayler said police believe one of the alleged burglars targeted the home because he suspected his girlfriend had a relationship with the man who lived there. ""They probably were just not thinking straight and figured we'll go out and scare the guy or whatever,"" Cayler said. ""[They were] being dumb and combine that with alcohol and it was the perfect storm."" Both men were charged with attempted burglary, and McNelly was charged additionally with operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Lawyers for the two men could not be reached for comment. Cayler said he's been fielding calls about the case from news media outlets from all over the country -- mostly because of their funny-looking mug shots. ""I've been chief here almost 25 years, been with the department 28½ years and I've seen a lot of things that make me laugh and weird things but this was probably the best combination of the two -- strangely weird and hilariously funny all at the same time.""","Matthew McNelly and Joey Miller streaked their faces permanent black marker .

"The head of the bioterrorism lab involved in potentially exposing dozens of workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to deadly anthrax bacteria has resigned. Michael Farrell, who headed the Bioterrorism Rapid Response and Advanced Technology (BRRAT) Laboratory, submitted his resignation Tuesday, CDC spokesman Tom Skinner told CNN. He had been reassigned from his post last month, after the anthrax incident was made public. The CDC says the potential anthrax exposure happened between June 6 and June 13. The BRRAT lab had been preparing anthrax samples for use in two other labs on the CDC's Atlanta campus and failed to adequately deactivate the samples. According to a CDC investigation report, the exposure happened because the lab didn't use an approved sterilization technique. It didn't have a written plan reviewed by senior staff to make sure all safety protocols were followed, and there was a limited knowledge of peer-reviewed literature about the process that would make it less dangerous. The lab also did not have a standard operating procedure that would make sure the transfer of the material would be safe.

"(CNN) -- Jan Hooks, the actress and comedian who rose to fame with sly turns on ""Saturday Night Live"" as Ivana Trump, Tammy Faye Bakker, Sinead O'Connor and as part of the lounge-singing Sweeney Sisters, has died. She was 57. Her representative, Lisa Lieberman, confirmed the death to CNN. The cause of death was not revealed. In the late-'80s era of the show that also featured Phil Hartman, Dana Carvey, Nora Dunn and later Mike Myers, Hooks was the definition of a team player, always putting the sketch first. It was a character-actress attitude, one admired by others on the show. ""She was totally amazing as a sketch player,"" one of her colleagues, Kevin Nealon, told People magazine. ""She so immersed herself in her characters, and her timing was amazing. She got it from some crazy stratosphere, and I was so attracted to that talent in her, and I don't think she ever knew how well respected and admired she was for her talent,"" said Nealon, who also dated Hooks for a while. Hooks' ability can best be seen in her portrayal of Tammy Faye Bakker, part of the evangelist couple who co-founded the PTL Club and were later embroiled in scandal. Bakker, in many ways, was an easy target: an overwrought figure who wore heavy eye makeup, the very caricature of an evangelist's wife. But Hooks found something deeper, as she showed in a ""Church Chat"" sketch during the days when PTL was in trouble due to a Jim Bakker affair and accusations of high living by the couple. Hooks also stood out with her portrayal of Candy Sweeney, the blonde half of an effervescent pair of lounge singers who ladled on bad jokes and schmaltzy versions of pop hits, ignorant of their over-the-top performances. They regularly included a clanging version of ""The Trolley Song"" from the '40s movie ""Meet Me in St. Louis."" But Hooks generally shunned the star turns others took on the show. In ""The Sinatra Group,"" a parody of ""The McLaughlin Group"" led by Phil Hartman's Frank Sinatra, she was a deadly serious Sinead O'Connor, letting Hartman get the laughs for his tough-talking Sinatra. Hooks was on ""SNL"" from 1986 to 1991. She wasn't planning to leave the show, she later said, but was offered a part on ""Designing Women"" and couldn't pass up the opportunity. She played Carlene Dobber for two seasons on the show, which was set in Atlanta, right next to her hometown. Hooks was born in Decatur, Georgia, in 1957. After moving to Florida and Texas in her teen years, she returned to Atlanta and joined a comedy troupe named the New Wit's End Players, where she met writers Bonnie and Terry Turner. The three soon had jobs on a TBS show built around the offbeat Bill Tush, back when TBS was Ted Turner's Atlanta Braves-airing ""SuperStation."" (Tush later became a CNN showbiz correspondent.) The Turners -- no relation to Ted -- also worked on ""SNL"" and later created ""3rd Rock from the Sun,"" which occasionally featured Hooks. Did you ever meet Hooks? Share your photos and memories with CNN iReport . Hooks also appeared on ""30 Rock"" and sometimes provided the voice of Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon, the wife of convenience store owner Apu, on ""The Simpsons."" Hooks had roles in just a handful of movies, but her turn in ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" (1985) as an Alamo tour guide had many people sharing the scene on social media. ""Not now, but sometime this weekend I'll think of Jan Hooks saying 'adobe' and I'll get tear-eyed. I know it. #RIPJanHooks,"" tweeted Patton Oswalt. Hooks also appeared in ""Batman Returns"" (1992), ""Coneheads"" (1993) and ""Simon Burch"" (1998). People we've lost in 2014 .

"A lab mix-up involving a deadly flu virus strain added to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's public relations nightmare this summer. On Friday, the public health agency released the results of its internal investigation into the incident, along with a series of reports on actions being taken to ensure lab safety protocols are being properly followed. In May, CDC lab workers unintentionally mixed a low pathogenic, or non-dangerous, avian influenza virus sample with a potentially deadly virus called H5N1, then shipped the sample to an external lab run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The H5N1 strain has killed millions of birds and infected more than 600 people over the last decade. But no one appears to have been at-risk of being infected during the incident since the sample was stored and shipped properly, according to the CDC reports. ""The contamination most likely happened due to the failure of a laboratory scientist to adhere to established best practices and the absence of an approved laboratory team-specific protocol for the work being done,"" the reports concluded. Dr. Tom Frieden, the CDC's director, found out about the H5N1 incident nearly six weeks after it happened, something he called at the time ""most distressing."" This delay in reporting the cross-contamination was due to ""a lack of awareness and understanding about reporting requirements for Select Agents,"" according to the reports. Around the same time he heard about the flu incident, Frieden was dealing with the possible exposure of up to 86 of his workers to anthrax. Anthrax investigation turns up 'distressing' issues at CDC . Michael Farrell, who headed the Bioterrorism Rapid Response and Advanced Technology Laboratory involved, submitted his resignation in July. He had been reassigned from his post in June after the anthrax incident was made public. CDC lab director resigns after anthrax incident .

Bottom line: ""The scientists failed to follow a scientifically derived and reviewed protocol that would have assured the anthrax was deactivated,"" Frieden said last month. It ""should have happened, and it didn't."" As a result of these problems, the CDC has stopped transferring materials in and out of its highest-level labs. ""The moratorium will remain in place pending lab-by-lab review of policies and procedures for laboratory safety and security,"" the CDC says. CDC's lab problems have ripple effect on other outbreaks . Frieden plans to appoint a CDC director of laboratory safety, and establish a working group to review safety protocols. ""The work of safety is never complete,"" Dr. Michael Bell, interim director of laboratory safety, said in a statement. ""We will continue to take all necessary steps to maintain safety and advance CDC's critical laboratory science work, so that CDC labs are the most scientifically rigorous and the safest in the world.""","CDC lab workers unintentionally mixed non-dangerous flu strain with H5N1 .

"Syria denied Monday a report that its forces have been using cluster bombs in its civil war. ""The General Command of the Army and the Armed Forces stressed on Monday that the misleading media outlets have recently published untrue news claiming the Syrian Arab Army has been using cluster bombs against terrorists,"" the government's term for rebels, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. ""In a statement, the General Command said the Syrian Army does not possess such bombs, stressing that those news (reports) are untrue and come in the framework of misleading media which is aimed at diverting the public opinion from the practices of the armed terrorist groups against civilians."" The report came a day after the publication of a human rights report that accuses the Syrian air force of using Russian-made cluster bombs. Citing videos and witness accounts, Human Rights Watch said Syrian government forces were using the bombs. The report says the cluster bombs are Soviet-made, but it also says it's unclear how or when Syria may have acquired them. ""Syria's disregard for its civilian population is all too evident in its air campaign, which now apparently includes dropping these deadly cluster bombs into populated areas,"" said Steve Goose, arms director at Human Rights Watch. ""Cluster bombs have been comprehensively banned by most nations, and Syria should immediately stop all use of these indiscriminate weapons that continue to kill and maim for years."" Russia questioned the report's veracity. ""There is no confirmation to this,"" Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, according to Russia's state-owned RIA Novosti news agency. ""There are loads of weapons in this region, including in Syria and other countries of the region, and arms are supplied there in large quantities and illegally."" The bombs are particularly dangerous because they explode in the air, sending dozens or hundreds of smaller bombs over an area the size of a football field, Human Rights Watch said. ""These bomblets often fail to explode on initial impact, leaving duds that act like landmines and explode when handled,"" the group said. More than 70 countries have signed a treaty banning the use of cluster bombs; neither Syria nor the United States is among them. ""Cluster munitions have demonstrated military utility,"" the U.S. State Department says on its website. ""Their elimination from U.S. stockpiles would put the lives of its soldiers and those of its coalition partners at risk. Moreover, cluster munitions can often result in much less collateral damage than unitary weapons, such as a larger bomb or larger artillery shell would cause, if used for the same mission."" In other developments: . Turkey searches Syria-bound plane . For the second time in a week, Turkish officials on Monday searched a civilian plane that had been headed to Syria. Armenian and Turkish diplomats told CNN that an Armenian cargo plane that had been en route to Aleppo stopped first on Monday morning in the Turkish city of Erzurum for an inspection of its cargo. The move appeared to be part of Turkey's enforcement of a newly adopted blockade against the Syrian government. Unlike last week's grounding of a Syrian passenger plane flying from Moscow to Damascus, Monday's airplane inspection appeared to have been agreed to ahead of time by Armenian and Turkish authorities. After the search, which lasted at least five hours, the Armenian cargo plane was allowed to continue to Syria. ""The plane is transporting humanitarian aid to Syria and its stop in Turkey was planned,"" Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Tigran Balayan told CNN in an e-mail. ""The Turks, from our perspective, are taking a measured and appropriate posture with regard to these things,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters. Syria and Turkey have closed their airspace to each others' aircraft. The heightened tension between the two countries has alarmed U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Jeffrey Feltman, U.N. undersecretary for political affairs, told the Security Council on Monday. Also Monday, the Council of the European Union strengthened its sanctions against the Syrian government, adding 28 people deemed responsible for violence against the civilian population to a list of those subject to a travel ban and an asset freeze. That brings the total to 181 people and 54 entities. The council, in its 19th round of sanctions against Damascus, also banned EU nationals and businesses ""from supplying financial services to Syrian arms exports, including insurance and re-insurance,"" it said in a statement. ""We call on all states to refrain from delivering arms to Syria and to follow the EU in stopping the supplies that fuel the fighting,"" EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton said in a statement. In addition, the council denied Syrian Arab Airlines access to EU airports. Diplomatic front: Special envoy to Syria visits Iran and Iraq . Seeking to forge a solution to Syria's bloody civil war, international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi visited the country's key ally in the region, Iran, before heading Monday to Iraq. Brahimi met with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and called for an end to the flow of arms to both sides of the conflict, Brahimi's spokesman said. Rebel fighters have accused Iran of sending advisers to help Syrian President Bashar al-Assad put down the popular uprising. Before Brahimi departed Iran, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi handed him a ""written and unofficial proposal"" for resolving the Syrian crisis, Iran's IRNA news agency reported Monday. Details of the plan were not publicized. In Baghdad, Brahimi met with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. ""Iraq fully supports the joint U.N. and Arab efforts in order to reach a political solution to the deepening crisis in Syria,"" al-Maliki said in a statement issued by his office. Brahimi, the U.N.-Arab League joint special envoy to Syria, is visiting key countries in the region, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Over the weekend, he met in Istanbul with Turkish officials and with Syrian opposition leaders in an effort to broker a cease-fire. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly denounced al-Assad, accusing him of massacring his own people and calling for his resignation. Turkey is hosting about 100,000 Syrian refugees, and cross-border shelling that killed five Turkish civilians has led to a heightened confrontation between the two neighbors. Syria has berated its former ally, accusing Turkey of arming and funding Syrian rebels. CNN journalists have witnessed assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns being taken from Turkey to rebels inside Syria. The violence is showing no sign of abating. On Monday, 100 people were killed nationwide, the opposition Local Coordination Committees in Syria said, including 34 in and around Damascus and 29 in Aleppo. The World Health Organization condemned attacks on health facilities in Syria, saying they have damaged such facilities across the country, ""limiting access and the provision of essential health services."" It added, ""almost 67% of public hospitals have been affected as a result of the conflict and 29% of those affected are out of service."" Background . The opposition says more than 30,000 people have been killed since March 2011, when anti-government protesters took to the streets calling for political reform and an end to four decades of Assad family rule. The government responded with a violent clampdown, spawning an armed conflict that has spiraled into a civil war. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties in Syria because the government has restricted access by international journalists.","100 people are reported dead around Syria on Monday, an opposition group says .

"Gracen Duffield, 45, sold her house in Austin, Texas and threw in a successful career in IT with Dell Inc. to take MBA studies in China -- ""somewhere with real opportunities,"" she said. Leea Tiusanen, a 27-year-old from Finland, took a sabbatical from her managerial role at a large retail company to complete one year of her business degree in China. ""There's so much more happening over here (China) than there is in Europe,"" she said. And Jonathan Oi, a 25-year-old American with Chinese parents said he ""returned to the motherland"" to get his MBA at Guanghua School of Management to help differentiate himself from his American graduate-school peers. These three are just a few of the thousands of western students now flocking to China for higher education, cultural adventure and -- more often than not -- an edge in an extremely competitive job market. As Chinese swell the ranks at western universities, the numbers of foreign students studying in China are also burgeoning -- increasing by 10% in a year to more than 290,000 in 2011, according to the Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE). The push for foreign students is a deliberate strategy by the Chinese government -- through investment in scholarships and facilities -- to foster a greater understanding of their culture and language globally, and expand Beijing's ""soft power,"" academics say. Meanwhile, governments in the U.S., Asia and Europe also are investing in their own China study programs, often in conjunction with the Chinese government, breeding a new generation of Sino-savvy graduates. ""It's student exchanges linked to diplomacy,"" said Gerard Postiglione, a professor of education at the University of Hong Kong. Education's soft power . China's current five-year plan for the education sector aims for higher education institutes in the country to accommodate around 500,000 international students by 2020, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. China is rapidly expanding its Mandarin and English-language offerings -- 34 Chinese universities now offer English-taught programs, according to the MOE -- and the government said it plans to fund 50,000 scholarships for overseas students by 2015. ""If you look at Xi Jinping's speeches since he became president, he clearly says that we want soft power and we are willing to spend on this. And this is what the Chinese government is doing (with their international education programs),"" said Yang Rui, a University of Hong Kong professor who has written extensively on the issue. Governments in the U.S. and Europe are investing in their own programs to encourage more of their students to study in China. In 2010, the U.S. launched the ""100,000 Strong Initiative"" that aims to increase the number of American students studying in China to 100,000 by 2014, according to the 100,000 Strong website. The EU-China High Level People-to-People Dialogue (HPPD), described by the EU as ""the third pillar of EU-China relations,"" facilitated the first-ever higher education talks between Europe and China in April, where the Chinese government announced it would provide 30,000 scholarships for EU students over the next five years, according to Xinhua. But while the west wants improved relations, Yang believes China's communist system of government has resulted in a program more about control than diplomacy. ""Using education as part of a soft-power push has been practiced by many countries,"" he said. ""The U.S., France and Japan have been doing this for a long time. But the way the Chinese are doing this is not skillful."" Still, foreign students are pouring in. About 290,000 studied in China in 2011, compared to just over 60,000 in 2001, according to the MOE. South Koreans (62,442) were the largest group of foreign students studying in China in 2011, followed by Americans (23,292). The Japanese (17,961), Russians (13,340), Indonesians (10,957) and Indians (9,370) also have large student populations, while almost 50,000 Europeans undertook some form of tertiary study in China in 2011, led by France (7,592) and Germany (5,451). Are Chinese universities up to the challenge? While foreign students in China say it's more exciting studying here than in the west, it's also substantially cheaper. University tuition fees in China average about $1,000 per semester, according to the MOE, while rent, food and other incidentals are also substantially less. Tuition fees alone in the United States can cost anywhere from $12,000 to $37,000 per year, according to the U.S. National Center for Education, depending on the type of institution. That's on top of the average $15,000 per year required for accommodation, food and academic supplies. But questions have been raised over the quality of China's university education. ""On international rankings, Chinese universities did not perform as well as other countries, in particular given the size of the system, but there have been improvements in recent years,"" said Nick Clark, from World Education Services, a New York-based education research organization. Yang, who regularly visits universities across China for his research, agrees. ""I get many complaints about the quality of the teaching (from foreign students studying in China), especially with regional universities."" Professor Darryl Jarvis from the Hong Kong Institute of Education said there is enormous diversity among the tertiary institutions in China, and far less quality programs that use English for instruction compared to countries like the U.S., UK, Australia, and Canada, the top destinations for overseas university students in 2012, according to UNESCO. ""The biggest barrier China faces in attracting overseas students is the medium of instruction. Rightly or wrongly, English remains the language for business and academia and the rise of China is not going to change that overnight,"" Jarvis said. Learning through experience . And while many Chinese academics who trained overseas are now returning to China, attracting good-quality teachers and researchers with a high level of English remains a problem. Paul Gillis, an expatriate American professor and co-director at Peking University's business school in Beijing, says that although the teaching is rewarding, China won't be able to fill its ""insatiable demand"" for quality foreign professors until they start paying appropriate salaries. ""This is China's century. Here I have the ability to train some of most brilliant minds in the world and have a much bigger impact than I can anywhere else,"" said Gillis, when asked why he chose to teach in China over a western university. ""I think I have the best job in the world for 29 days of the month. Then comes payday."" But Beijing is investing heavily in its universities to overcome gaps in quality, academics say. ""There is definitely a desire to see institutions perform better in the rankings,"" said Clark. ""Funding through government programs are specifically designed to boost standards in 'key' research areas, while the banding together of the top nine Chinese institutions under the C9 League is a clear indication that the country would like to see its best institutions competing at a global level of excellence."" For students like Jonathan Oi, the shortcomings he has encountered with Peking University's ""relatively young"" business program are more than compensated for in the lessons learned outside the classroom. ""You shouldn't come to China looking for a Western-style education or you will be disappointed,"" Oi said. ""Previously education to me was all about the books and the quality of the classes, but you need to factor in the outside experiences as well.""","Overseas students studying in China increased 10% in a year to more than 290,000 in 2011 .

"(CNN) -- Why did he do it? That's what so many of us are asking after Jaylen Fryberg, a popular freshman, opened fire on classmates during lunch at Marysville-Pilchuck High School north of Seattle on Friday. The shootings left two girls dead and three other students injured, including two of Fryberg's cousins, one of whom remains in critical condition. Fryberg died after turning the gun on himself. We typically assume that school shooters fit the narrative of a loner, struggling to fit in, ostracized and bullied by his peers. But by all accounts, Fryberg was well-liked, a member of the football team who planned to try out for wrestling too and who was recently named the school's freshman homecoming prince. What made him snap? We don't know and may never know, but as reports come in that Fryberg might have been dealing with a breakup or anger that a girl he liked rebuffed him and was with his cousin, we have to ask ourselves whether we are doing enough to help our boys deal with difficult emotions and express them without resorting to violence. Fryberg, it seems, was using social media to express some of the pain he appeared to be feeling. Washington school shooting forgives the gunman -- his cousin . ""Tell me what your plan is,"" he wrote on Twitter at the end of August. ""You can't make a bond with anyone like the bond me and you have right now.... Tell me what your going to do."" He went on to say, ""Your gonna piss me off... And then some (expletive's) gonna go down and I don't think you'll like it."" Days before the shooting, he wrote, ""It breaks me... It actually does... I know it seems like I'm sweating it off... But I'm not.. And I never will be able to."" ""It's a cry for help,"" said Avital Norman Nathman, who wrote a story for The Frisky on the Washington tragedy headlined ""School Shootings, Toxic Masculinity and 'Boys Will Be Boys.'"" ""This kid was hurting, but do we have a safe space for young men to feel OK talking about their feelings without fear of repercussion, whether that's teasing, even if it's gentle ribbing?"" asked Norman Nathman, editor of the motherhood anthology ""The Good Mother Myth."" Emotional literacy in boys . Type ""emotional literacy for boys"" into Google, and ""Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys"" is the first item that will pop up. Coincidentally, the book came out just days before the Columbine school shooting. Co-author Michael Thompson says the ""cultural ideal of masculinity,"" the thinking that men need to be strong and independent, is causing many boys and young men to have trouble bearing difficult emotions. Masculinity, mental illness and guns: A lethal equation? ""Teenage boys still have the myths,"" Thompson said. ""They still believe in the myths of total strength and independence, and when your girlfriend (drops) you and you are flooded with feelings of loss, shame and abandonment, then you think you can't manage these feelings. ""And that's where the issue of emotional literacy comes in, because emotional literacy means being able to identify your feelings and being able to manage them,"" said Thompson, a clinical psychologist who works at a boys school in Massachusetts. ""The Mask You Live In,"" to be released in 2015, is a film about the impact that our ""narrow definition"" of masculinity is having on boys, men and society in general. The experts interviewed for the film say ""that boys have been socialized in such a way that they're not supposed to experience pain or suffering and that they're expected to be dominant, stoic and in control at all times,"" said Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the film's writer, producer and director. She also wrote, produced and directed the documentary ""Miss Representation,"" which examined the role of the media in the underrepresentation of women in power. ""If young men do not have an outlet for expressing their feelings and communicating honestly and outwardly with others, they are subject to an incredibly lonely and isolating existence,"" said Siebel Newsom, who is also the founder and chief executive officer of the non-profit The Representation Project. The numbers paint a portrait of frustration and despair that can lead to extreme behavior: Eighty-one percent of completed suicides among young people ages 10 to 24 are by boys, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although girls attempt suicide twice as often, Thompson said, they typically leave notes or take pills, whereas boys often ""get a gun or hang themselves or they jump off a bridge."" ""Why are they doing that?"" Thompson asked. ""Well, they feel they have to do something that looks strong. 'I'm hurt but I'm still strong. I can leap off a bridge.' They do what in many ways is the final test of masculinity."" What more can we do to help boys? Siebel Newsom believes a conversation is necessary among parents, guardians, educators and coaches and young men, allowing boys to know that ""there is more than one way to 'be a man.' "" SOS for stressed-out teens . ""We have to redefine healthy masculinity for our boys to include empathy, emotion, care and compassion,"" she said. ""And we have to model it, challenging unhealthy dominant norms in public culture and daily life."" Thompson said that as we see an increase in fathers' involvement in their sons' lives, people's idea of masculinity will change. ""If your father is diapering you from the get-go and taking care of you and bathing you and feeding you, then you don't think masculinity is just a 'tough thing.' "" He also said we should think about encouraging our boys to take on caretaking positions, just like girls do, in terms of babysitting or helping the elderly. ""Meeting the needs of somebody who's dependent allows you to become more accepting of your own dependency needs,"" he said. Do modern dads get enough credit? Parents need to talk to their boys, but too often they aren't using the right words, said Thompson. ""They're often saying 'Be in touch with your emotions' ... 'Embrace your inner femininity,' and men experience that as they are being told to be more like women, and they reject it, and teenage boys do especially."" Dad: No 'be a man' narrative in home . Jim Higley of Chicago, who has two sons and a daughter, said he has always tried to help his sons understand what they are feeling by ""literally saying to them, 'You're feeling frustrated / anxious / nervous / hurt right now, but I promise that feeling will go away.' "" ""As a dad, we are obligated to take our sons by the hand and make sure they are as familiar with their emotions as they are with healthy eating habits, the importance of exercise and sexuality,"" said Higley, an award-winning author, radio host and creator of the site Bobblehead Dad. Buzz Bishop, father of two boys who are 4 and 7, said the ""be a man"" narrative is not present in their home. ""There are not stereotypical gender roles in the house,"" said Bishop, of Calgary, Alberta, who founded a blog called Dad Camp. ""I am an active and engaged parent and don't feel the need to berate masculinity into them."" Terry Greenwald, a divorced father of three, says he has spent a lifetime dealing with his own emotions and trying to find ways to deal with them effectively. When it comes to his younger son, who is 26, he believes he has been dealing with the ""being tough"" issue since the boy started playing hockey when he was 5. ""They fall or get hit and are told 'be tough' or 'get back out there,' "" Greenwald said. ""As a parent and a former athlete, I wanted him to find a balance, not let little things stop him but also not to try and keep playing if he really was hurt."" Greenwald said he tried to strike a balance with his son with emotional issues too -- ""what to share and what to hold inside"" -- and to this day tries to initiate conversations with his son ""to open the doors to him expressing his feelings."" Norman Nathman, who has a 7-year-old son, says they play the song ""It's Alright to Cry"" from the hit '70s album ""Free to Be ... You and Me"" all the time in their household. ""It's such a simple concept but one that gets lost to boys as they grow up,"" she said. She wishes middle and high schools would focus as much on emotional development as many elementary schools do, where the goal is giving boys tools on how to work out feelings, just like they have tools for math and language arts. ""It's just padding up their tool belt so they have more things to go to before it boils over and it turns into any number of these tragedies.""

"One of the most dangerous asteroids on record zipped close by Earth last month. It made headlines on Thursday, when reports said that there's a chance it could strike our planet in less than 20 years.  Such a collision could unleash a force as powerful as a couple of thousand atomic bombs. But NASA was quick to calm nerves and point out some very good news.  The most dangerous known asteroids don't really pose much of a threat.  And there are very few of them. Also, the chances that this one, which the Ukrainian astronomers who discovered it named 2013 TV135, will collide with Earth are extremely slim, NASA said in a statement it called ""a reality check."" The space agency is 99.998% certain that when it whooshes back around the planet in 2032, it will simply sail past us again. The probability of it striking Earth currently stands at 1:63,000, and even those odds are fading fast, as scientists find out more about the asteroid. ""This is a relatively new discovery,"" said Don Yeomans, manager of NASA's NEO Program. ""With more observations, I fully expect we will be able to significantly reduce, or rule out entirely, any impact probability for the foreseeable future."" 2013 TV135 was discovered on October 8, while NASA was closed during the government shutdown. And already it looks to soon be joining the ranks of the more than 10,000 known near-Earth objects that are virtually certain to cause us no harm. But until then, it has the distinction of having a danger rating of 1 out of a possible 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, the system that gauges the danger of impact destruction by asteroids. The 1 rating means that it poses ""no unusual level of danger."" There is ""no cause for public attention or concern."" Almost all other asteroids that scientists have discovered rank a 0 on the scale.  There is another asteroid with a danger rating of 1.  And it, too, is no cause for alarm, NASA says. September's close pass . The close pass 2013 TV135 made on September 16 was not a near miss. At a distance of 4.2 million miles as it flew by, it was more than 15 times as far away from Earth as the moon. That pales by compare to the closest shave the Earth got from an asteroid of considerable size in recorded history. On February 15 this year, asteroid 2012 DA14, which measured 150 feet wide, slipped in below the moon's orbit and squeaked by our planet just 17,200 miles from its surface. The one that passed by in September is big, with a diameter of 1,300 feet. That's the size of four football fields, but it does not quite make it an Earth crusher. An asteroid needs to be at least twice as large to advance into that league. ""We believe anything larger than one to two kilometers (about 0.6 to 1.2 miles) could have worldwide effects,"" NASA said in a statement. Russian divers find huge suspected meteorite chunk . Near passes daily . Two behemoths in that size range will pass by planet Earth in the next three months at similar distances as 2013 TV135. NASA says that neither will hit us. Near asteroid passes are common. They pretty much occur daily, if not two or three times a day, NASA says. They come, and they go, and they leave the Earth in peace. In addition, particles from space bombard our planet every minute -- at a rate of 100 tons a day, NASA says. You eat them; you drink them; you breathe them. Much of you and everything else on Earth contains them. Distant catastrophe . Though it seems Earth is safe for now, there is such a thing as a doomsday asteroid. Scientists say it is likely that the impact of an asteroid over six miles wide wiped out dinosaurs along with much of the life on Earth 65 million years ago. More like it will come, NASA says. But they only turn up once every ""few million years."" That may give humanity some time to find a way of dealing with it.

"Call him Phil. That's what most people did. It was ""Phil,"" not ""Philip,"" and certainly not ""Philip Seymour."" (He used the Seymour because there was already an actor named Philip Hoffman, and union rules prevent two actors from using the same exact name.) He didn't stand on ceremony. At the LAByrinth Theater Company, where he was an artistic director (and where his longtime partner, Mimi O'Donnell, has the same post), he involved himself in fundraising, directing, acting -- whatever it took. ""I've seen him tear tickets and seat people at LAB productions,"" playwright John Patrick Shanley told The New York Times Magazine. Shanley, also involved in LAB, wrote the play ""Doubt,"" which featured Hoffman in one of the lead roles. Sources: Philip Seymour Hoffman dead of apparent drug overdose . In Atlanta, where he was filming the final two ""Hunger Games"" movies, a local remembered an easygoing, gracious man. ""He was really soft spoken and kind,"" real estate agent Carter Phillips told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""I had this idea that he would be really intense, maybe, but no. I couldn't see any turmoil in his eyes. I felt like everything was right on with him."" He liked to work. When he wasn't starring in a movie, he was taking a small part. When he wasn't making films, he was in theater. If he wasn't performing, he would have been a teacher, he told ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" in 2000. He had memories of times when he wasn't acting -- or working -- at all. ""Being unemployed is not good for any actor, no matter how successful you are,"" he once said. ""You always remember what it feels like to go to the unemployment office, what it feels like to be fired from all those restaurants."" Camaraderie . Acting was his home. He knew it as a 12-year-old watching Arthur Miller's ""All My Sons"" in his hometown of Rochester, New York, he said in a 2010 interview. ""Immediately I knew it was a place I wanted to be,"" he said. ""Being around people who were doing that. ... That's still kind of what makes me feel comfortable. That's why I've worked with a lot of the same people over and over again."" Philip Seymour Hoffman's everyman greatness . At the time, Hoffman -- one of four children of a Xerox staffer and a judge who divorced when he was 9 -- was more of an athlete, a three-sport participant. But a neck injury at 14 dashed his sports dreams. Instead, he hit the stage. Of course, it wasn't all about greasepaint and cheers, he admitted to The New York Times Magazine. ""There was this beautiful girl. I had a huge crush on her, and she acted,"" he said. ""It seemed like something worth giving up baseball for."" But he was good at acting. He passed an audition to a New York state arts program, where he met Bennett Miller, who became a lifelong friend and later directed him in ""Capote"". Later, attending NYU, he took in all the theater world had to offer. ""You're really part of the city. The theater is all around you, and if you want to rub your shoulders against it, you can, and if you want to try for usher jobs, or internships at working theaters, you can. And I did all that,""  he said. His other home was with his family. He met O'Donnell, a costume designer, at LAByrinth. The pair had three children: Tallulah, Willa and Cooper. His children were all younger than 11. He doted on his children. He was regularly seen with them in his Greenwich Village neighborhood. He brought them to work. He noted they were unimpressed, especially with movies. ""Movies are difficult. 'Why are we in this warehouse? Why aren't there seats? Isn't this supposed to be a show?' "" he recalled them asking. ""I've taken them and they watch for a bit and it's like, 'Yeah, great Daddy, that was neat. Now -- can we please go home?' "" 'That's what you do' Still, there was obviously a darkness to Hoffman that came through with his intensity. Describing ""Synecdoche, New York,"" to the Times Magazine, he said, ""I'd finish a scene, walk right off the set, go in the bathroom, close the door and just take some breaths to regain my composure."" Sources: Nearly 50 envelopes of suspected heroin in Hoffman's apartment . In an appreciation, New York magazine film critic David Edelstein recalled how Hoffman seemed to revel in the unpleasant aspects of his characters, something Edelstein noticed in 2005's ""Capote."" Hoffman apparently fought director Miller -- a friend, mind you -- to make Truman Capote more difficult, not less. ""Ever since then, I've been conscious of how much he went out of his way to make his characters unbenign,"" wrote Edelstein. ""It was central to his power as an actor, though I wonder if at times he didn't confuse self-hatred for integrity."" Hoffman could also be hard on himself, Edelstein added -- and Hoffman, in other interviews, agreed. While making 2010's ""Jack Goes Boating,"" his feature directorial debut, he told an interviewer at the Toronto film festival that he was his own worst critic. ""I was a bad actor in front of me a lot,"" he said. ""There were some days when it was real dark."" In recent months, he'd had his share of challenges. He was up front about his struggle with drug abuse, telling TMZ last year he'd gone to a rehab facility after falling off the wagon. According to the UK newspaper The Independent, he and O'Donnell had separated last fall after 14 years together. Observers commented that he looked disheveled at the Sundance Film Festival in January, though Vanity Fair's Krista Smith described him as ""present and engaged."" But if anything was wrong, he kept it to himself. For all his familiarity and politeness, he could be guarded. He left it all on set or on stage. In that 2010 Toronto interview, with a touch of black humor, he talked about how hard it was to keep pushing the boulder up the hill. Why do ""Othello,"" he asked. Why put yourself on stage for hours, convinced you're terrible, and wait for the approval -- or disapproval -- of the audience? Because that's what makes it worthwhile, he said. ""That road to death we call life can be just burgers and booze and women and smokes and TV and magazines and really bad arts, and you just go and slide right into the hole,"" he said. ""Or you can go, I think I'd better keep confronting and keep challenging and keep trying to make good stuff and working hard. ... That's what you do. If you don't do that, it's so easy to go to that other place."" On her Facebook page, Jessica Chastain, who co-starred with Hoffman in a 2009 production of ""Othello,"" could only quote from that Shakespeare play. ""The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,Sing all a green willow.Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,Sing willow, willow, willow.The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans.Sing willow, willow, willow.Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones.Sing willow, willow, willow.""","Philip Seymour Hoffman a private man who gave all in performance .

"Cynthia Scudo is a portrait of an all-American mom of eight and grandmother of 18 who survived an extraordinary journey lasting a decade: She became addicted to prescription painkillers and then to heroin. You'd never guess it. Trim, petite, with a bob and easy smile, Scudo had enough energy to work full-time and preside over a large family in Denver. She had it all -- until it crumbled. Her dark secret about a taboo drug is not as isolated as it seems, especially with the revelations of public figures whose early deaths involved heroin, such as actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, who overdosed on a cocktail of legal and illegal drugs. Prescription drug abuse is now a health epidemic in America, worse than crack in the 1980s, and Scudo's story is one example. Her addiction to a handful of prescription drugs, with OxyContin as first and foremost, led to heroin because it gave her the same high at a cheaper price. Both are opiates. ""In the beginning, it was a feel-good,"" said Scudo, 55. ""At the end, it was black."" Scudo didn't shoot heroin. Rather, she smoked it using a straw, tinfoil and a lighter to inhale a smaller than pea-sized pinch of ""black tar"" heroin. She exhaled the smoke through a fan vent in the basement bathroom of her home, sometimes at 2 a.m., so her children wouldn't smell anything. ""There's such a stigma about heroin, that it's dirty and it's IV users under the bridge and homeless people, and that is so not the case,"" Scudo said. ""Heroin crosses all borders, all socioeconomic groups."" Scudo's addiction was far from unique. The path from prescription drugs to heroin is well traveled, according to Dr. Patrick Fehling, a psychiatrist at the University of Colorado Hospital's Center for Dependency, Addiction and Rehabilitation. ""That is very common. I have a lot of patients that ask me, 'Are prescription opioid painkillers gateway drugs towards heroin?'"" Fehling said. ""Absolutely."" Scudo's drug use, while extreme, shouldn't obscure one reality: ""Prescription drug abuse is a massive problem in the United States,"" Fehling said. How it began . For Scudo, her addiction began -- as they all do -- innocently enough. She sought relief from hip pain, possibly caused by scarring from cesarean sections she had delivering several of her children. Her then-husband recommended a physician. ""There was no physical therapy offered,"" she said of the doctor's visit. ""The first reaction was, let's give you some drugs."" He put her on OxyContin. By the second week, she was physically addicted. She was popping so much of the painkiller and other drugs such as anti-anxiety Valium that they equated to a dosage for three men. A second doctor reduced her prescription, causing Scudo to experience withdrawal symptoms, or become ""dope-sick."" ""When you start withdrawing from opiates, it focuses in your lower back and your legs, and it is like somebody has clamped a vice on both sides of your hips and is just smashing you. Hitting my back with a baseball bat would have been more comfortable,"" Scudo said. She was desperate for more OxyContin. ""Some people are not addicts and can take drugs as prescribed,"" she explained. ""But for the few people who are addicts, it's a whole different ball game."" To feed her cravings, Scudo leveraged her maternal authority: She found drug dealers who were friends of her eldest children. ""When you have eight children,"" she said, ""you're bound to know people."" It was so easy. But it was also so expensive. One OxyContin pill cost $80 on the street. ""One OxyContin wouldn't last me at all,"" she said. ""I could never take just one OxyContin. That wouldn't even keep the dope-sick away."" So she turned to heroin. Why? Her fear of withdrawal was greater than her fear of the drug. Living fearlessly . Like OxyContin, heroin was abundant on the street. In Denver. In the suburbs. Once you bought from one dealer, several more approached you, she said. She bought seven balloons -- or seven grams -- of heroin for $100, she said. That kept her high for up to three days. ""I would do some crazy stuff to get drugs,"" she said. ""Like 2 o'clock in the morning, I'm making a run to downtown Denver. Like picking up my grandkids in the car (to go to a drug deal), praying that I was not going to get busted."" No risk was too great. Never did she think of what she had to lose. ""Not once,"" she explained. ""That's the addict in me."" After almost 10 years of heroin addiction, she wondered how much her family knew. Her children stopped bringing the grandchildren to visit her. She pawned family heirlooms. Her second marriage failed, and she stole from her ex-husband. ""I know they knew that I was struggling, but they didn't know how to help. I'm sure that they were scared to death for me,"" she said, ""and the sad part is...I didn't care."" She fooled herself. After all, she was good at lying. Her job was going well. The bosses promoted her a few times. Everything was manageable, except when she got home from work at 4 p.m. and was in bed for the night at 4:30 p.m. ""I didn't want to think. I didn't want to feel. Actually I didn't care if I lived or died,"" she said. The only person she couldn't fool was her alcoholic mom in recovery, who noticed Scudo's weight loss and asked her, ""Are you ready for help?"" Scudo responded with an ""I got this, mom, I got it."" I went from heroin addict to PTA mom . What the mirror told her . The breaking point came one morning after taking a shower. Scudo looked at herself in a full-length mirror, naked, for the first time in six months. ""I looked like an Auschwitz survivor,"" she said. ""I was a skeleton. I had this lovely green glow going, so I knew my liver was shutting down. The skin was hanging, literally hanging off my body. ""And something about that moment when I saw myself triggered something in my head,"" she said. The next day, her ex-husband called her at work in a confrontation about a problem. Scudo had enough. She wanted to drive her car off the highest overhang on Interstate 70, but feared she wouldn't die immediately and would end up in pain. She went home, kissed the two children still living with her, went to the bedroom and cried. She closed the door. She found eight OxyContin pills, but that wasn't going to be enough to kill her. She was used to downing six at a time, crushed. She fell asleep and took a sick day from work the next morning. How heroin kills you . Hitting bottom . Her mother knocked on her door at 10 a.m. Her son-in-law, who worked at the same company as Scudo, told her that Scudo took a sick day. ""Have you damn well had enough?"" her mother asked her. ""And for some reason, 'yes' came out of my mouth,"" Scudo said. They checked her into a 30-day inpatient program for addiction on April 19, 2011, the last day she took drugs. That meant her first day without dope was, ironically, also the unofficial, international get-high day of April 20, she noted. Her detoxification was ""six days of hell,"" she said. ""I lost 9 pounds in six days,"" she recounted. ""I threw up every 15 minutes. I would have to live in the shower with the water temperature of 120 degrees to burn the skin to not feel the pain in my back."" She's been clean for three years now, she said. She's on her third marriage. She's changed jobs, becoming an office manager over 200 employees at a credit card company. And she no longer wants to die. ""I am not ashamed of the fact that I am who I am. The only way that I will not make this is if I start keeping secrets from myself and other people and then my head gets to start playing games with me and telling me it has a good idea,"" Scudo said. ""And I have got way too much to live for to go back."" She now hosts a monthly family dinner -- for 45 people in her little green house. And the grandchildren visit again the once-lost matriarch.

"A new witness in the police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, told CNN that Brown and the police officer tussled at the police car window, then the officer shot the teen multiple times, as Brown backed away. ""What I saw was when Michael and the cop were wrestling through the window,"" Tiffany Mitchell told CNN's Don Lemon. A shot was fired while Brown was out the window. He got free, and the officer got out of the vehicle, followed Brown and shot him, she said. He raised his hands, and the officer kept firing, she said. Police fired tear gas at a crowd of protesters late Wednesday for another night, as the group gathered to protest Brown's deadly shooting. Officers in riot gear then marched toward the protesters near a burned out gas station, which has become the gathering point for demonstrations. Police announced that they no longer considered the protest peaceful, before they fired the canisters, CNN producer Yon Pomrenze said. People fled in all directions, as the stinging clouds wafted by them. A separate small group of over a dozen people gathered outside Ferguson's police station holding up signs and chanting protests for a fifth day. Officer not named . Police have said Brown died in a dangerous struggle after trying to grab the officer's weapon, but witnesses say it seemed a brazen act of aggression by the officer on Saturday, and that Brown was unarmed and not threatening. On Wednesday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told CNN that the officer had been hit and suffered swelling on the side of his face. He was taken to a hospital and released the same day, Jackson said. Five days have passed since Brown's killing, and the public still does not know the name of the person who pulled the trigger. There have been cries of a cover-up. ""That doesn't give the community confidence. That doesn't make it transparent,"" attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters. ""And remember, we've got a long way to go before this community starts to believe that the police are going to give them all the answers and not try to sweep it under the rug."" Crump was one of the attorneys who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenager who was killed in a 2012 altercation with Florida man George Zimmerman. But Mayor James W. Knowles said police have received death threats against the officer and his family. They want to prevent further violence, he said. Hackers have gone after his personal information and worked people up against members of government and the police, he said. A town in turmoil -- 5 things about Ferguson, Missouri . Trouble at night . Police have asked protesters to restrict their gatherings to daylight hours, after violence has broken out repeatedly after nightfall. Protests during the day have been peaceful. Protests on Sunday and Monday ended with clashes with police and looting . Police have made 47 arrests after Brown's shooting, KMOV reported. ""We understand the anger; we understand that people want answers. We understand that we've got a problem, but we're just asking people to be peaceful,"" Jackson said. The Ferguson-Florissant School District announced that it was pushing back the start of classes this year. School had been scheduled to resume Thursday. Civil rights . Federal civil rights investigators and the FBI carry out their own inquiry into the controversial case. In the town of 21,000, there's a history of distrust between the predominantly black community and the largely white police force. ""Race relations is a top priority right now and, as I said, I'm working with the Department of Justice to improve that,""  Jackson told reporters Wednesday. Only three of the city's 53 officers are African-American, and Jackson said he is working to change that. Dorian Johnson, who said he saw the shooting, told CNN on Tuesday that the officer who opened fire is white.

"(CNN) -- The cardiac arrest leading to Joan Rivers' death happened as the comedian's personal doctor began performing a biopsy on her vocal cords, a source close to the death investigation told CNN. A staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor, who has not been publicly identified, took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia, the source said. Rivers, 81, was at the clinic for a scheduled endoscopy by another doctor, gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen. That procedure, intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. After Cohen, the clinic's medical director, finished his work, a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent, according to the source. An ear, nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic as required by law performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. The doctor is described by the source as Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat physician. Clinic: Vocal-cord biopsy did not kill Joan Rivers . ""Even though you are a licensed physician, you still should have, if you will, the checks and balances to get your approval to practice in that particular place,"" said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University's Langone Medical Center. Investigators believe that Rivers' vocal cords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said. Rivers, 81, was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she died a week later. Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released. The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Dr. Cohen ""is not currently performing procedures... nor is he currently serving as medical director."" The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators. The clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law. Timeline emerges in Joan Rivers' death .

"(CNN) -- The numbers tell the story: Of the 308 million-plus citizens in the United States, 30% have passports. That's just too low for such an affluent country, said Bruce Bommarito, executive vice president and chief operating officer for the U.S. Travel Association. ""Americans are comfortable in their own environment,"" Bommarito said. There were 61.5 million trips outside the United States in 2009, down 3% from 2008, according to the Office of Travel and Tourism Industries. About 50% of those trips were to either Mexico or Canada, destinations that didn't require a passport until 2007. The percentage of Americans with passports -- a number that was in the teens just a few years ago -- has spiked since the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative was adopted. It requires American and Canadian travelers to present documents showing citizenship when entering the United States. Despite the climbing number of American passports in circulation, 30% is still low compared to Canada's 60% and the United Kingdom's 75%. ""Not taking the leap is comforting, because this is the American life,"" said Matthew Kepnes, international traveler and creator of NomadicMatt.com, a blog chronicling his travels and observations. ""Breaking outside anything that is your norm is scary."" Tourism experts and avid travelers attribute Americans' lack of interest in international travel to a few key factors, including: the United States' own rich cultural and geographic diversity, an American skepticism and/or ignorance about international destinations, a work culture that prevents Americans from taking long vacations abroad and the prohibitive cost and logistics of going overseas. Cultural and geographical diversity . America has it all: ""From the mountains, to the prairies, to the oceans, white with foam,"" as ""God Bless America"" proclaims. Beautiful beaches in Florida, crisp skiing in Colorado and the desert sun in Arizona are among thousands of domestic destinations competing to lure visitors. ""In the United States, we have an enormous amount of places we can travel -- basically an entire continent,"" said everything-everywhere.com author Gary Arndt, who has been traveling abroad and blogging since 2007. ""You can do all kinds of things without needing a passport."" Arndt, who was in Los Angeles when interviewed by CNN, noted that he could go to any number of different ethnic enclaves within the city and get a taste of culture without spending much money or time. The same goes for many other parts of the country. ""There are pockets of regional culture -- the South has an attitude that New Yorker's don't have,"" Kepnes said. ""But you don't have the cultural differences that you would get if you went to Asia, Paris or London."" Even with Chinatown in Los Angeles and Little Italy in New York City, it's just not the same as walking the streets of Beijing or riding a gondola in Venice. ""America is an outstanding country and an outstanding vacation destination -- no doubt about that,"" said Joe Byrne, executive vice president for Tourism Ireland. ""But it is America. I'm sure you have great Irish traditional music in an American Irish pub, but you don't have the Lakes of Killarney."" Skepticism and ignorance . We buy goods from Sri Lanka and outsource business to India, but when it comes to traveling to these destinations, Americans would rather stick close to home. ""Our culture doesn't emphasize knowledge of the world,"" Kepnes said. ""We're more skeptical of it because we just don't know about it."" Kepnes attributes some of our skepticism to negative media reports about the world. For example, he said that Nicaragua always draws negative connotations because of the political and civil unrest that has been covered in the news. ""When I first left I was very nervous and scared,"" Kepnes said of traveling to countries like Nicaragua. ""What if I'm mugged in Thailand or kidnapped in a hostel?"" Arndt has encountered similar feelings when he travels to lesser-known destinations. Though he is comfortable in his travels, others aren't so convinced. ""Every time I say I'm going somewhere, people assume that it's dirty, they don't have good hospitals, you're going to get sick or raped or robbed,"" Arndt said. ""If you know something about Colombia, it's drug lords, which hasn't been a problem for 20 years, but that's still what people think of."" Arndt pointed out that foreign countries generally don't make it into the media for doing good things, just for natural disasters or bad news. ""I think there's a lot of fears that people have that may be used to justify the fact that they don't go somewhere,"" he said. Work culture . Many Americans follow the same pattern: work hard in high school, go to college, accrue a load of debt and get a job right away to work it off, Arndt said. The United States doesn't promote taking a year off between major life phases like New Zealand or the United Kingdom. ""Up until recently, having a gap year was a job killer, so you chose work,"" Kepnes said. ""And that work, work, work mentality makes it much harder to leave."" A one-year break in your resume could make an American employer question your commitment to a company, whereas not taking a gap year in New Zealand would be considered crazy, Kepnes said. ""We're not a travel culture,"" he said. ""Countries are travel cultures when they put more of an emphasis on leisure time, and Americans tend to choose money over leisure time."" Even those who do receive a nice chunk of vacation time don't use it all, and those who do seem to take shorter, more frequent trips, Arndt said. ""There are some differences in terms of vacation time that are hugely influential,"" Byrne said. Workers in mainland Europe receive between six and eight weeks of vacation, while Americans average about 16.6 paid vacation days as of 2005, according to the Families and Work Institute. Thirty-six percent of those surveyed didn't plan to use their full vacation. ""It's not just about how much vacation time people get,"" Arndt said. ""Americans don't even use all the vacation time that they have."" Cost and logistics . When trying to entice Americans to visit Ireland, Byrne said the first thing he does is remind people that it's more affordable than they think. ""That's generally true of vacations to Europe,"" Byrne said. ""The exchange rate is more favorable for Americans than it has been in recent years."" The 30.3 million Americans who traveled overseas for vacation in 2009 spent an average of $2,708 each -- including airfare, lodging and other expenditures, according to the Office of Travel and Tourism Industries. It seems that getting there is about half the battle: Average airfare per person was  $1,177. Also, as Kepnes pointed out, time is money for some Americans. ""It's an easier hop if you're in Paris or Madrid, or any other European city,"" Byrne said. ""Whereas the flights from the East Coast of the United States take up to six hours."" The United States is so big that a flight from one state to another could take just as much time as a flight to Europe. At any rate, Americans are more likely to do the former. ""We're a big country, and we have a culture of traveling within the United States,"" Bommarito said. ""When you're born and raised in a European or South Asian country, your access to other countries is much easier."" Arndt doesn't see this changing any time soon, if at all. ""Cultural shifts like that are not something that happens quickly,"" he said. A swing toward international travel is going to take time. Still, Kepnes said he believes that more Americans going abroad will become inevitable sooner or later. ""Americans are going to have to speak more languages and be more culturally savvy,"" Kepnes said. ""We have to change because we have to do business with all these other cultures."" That's music to Bommarito's ears. After being nervous the first time he landed in China, he said he now feels just as comfortable on the streets of Beijing as he does anywhere in the United States. ""One of the true benefits of travel to foreign countries is it's probably the greatest form of diplomacy,"" Bommarito said. ""Strange ideas go away and you realize that we're all similar, just with different cultures.""","30% of American citizens have passports .
50% of international trips were to either Mexico or Canada .

"An Indian airline has hit on possibly the worthiest excuse yet for hiring slim women as cabin crew -- it saves fuel and therefore money. While some airlines admit to hiring women for their sex appeal, budget carrier GoAir has told The Times of India it will be hiring predominantly female flight attendants in future because they are 15-20 kilos lighter on average than men. The airline estimates each extra kilo on board costs Rs3 ($0.05) per flying hour, and the new policy will save it up to $500,000 annually. A spokesman for the airline denied to CNN that it had implemented a gender-biased recruitment policy. But he confirmed that the airline's male-female cabin crew ratio of 40:60 was among the most male-heavy in the industry in India. He also confirmed that GoAir would be seeking to adjust this ratio to be in line with the industry norm of 30 men to 70 women. Other weight-reduction initiatives will also be employed. ""The size of in-flight magazines has been reduced,"" the airline's CEO Giorgio De Roni said. ""The potable water tanks are no longer being filled to capacity as only 35% to 40% of that water is actually used."" GoAir's 130 male cabin staff (out of 330 total) will be unaffected -- the policy affects future hires only. The airline expects to hire around 2,000 flight attendants and pilots over the next seven years. Weight and its reduction is a key focus for airlines as fuel costs, comprising a third to half an airline's operating costs, continue to rise. Samoa Air last year became the first airline to charge fees according to weight, and a Norwegian economist has claimed this is the fairest and most sensible way to calculate prices.

"Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell has canceled plans to drill in the Arctic waters off Alaska  this year after a federal court ruling put the company's multibillion-dollar project on hold, the company said Thursday. It's the second year Shell has postponed its push to drill in the Chukchi Sea, where it began exploratory drilling in 2012. The effort caused widespread concern among environmentalists and native Alaskan communities, who have taken the company and the U.S. government to court to stop it. ""The lack of a clear path forward and an associated timeline makes it impossible to commit the resources needed to explore safely in 2014,"" Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said. A federal appeals court ruled last week that federal regulators used ""an unrealistically low estimate"" of the amount of oil Shell might be able to produce when calculating the project's impact on the Arctic environment. Environmental groups cheered the company's decision to sit out the year. ""Arctic offshore drilling is fraught with dangers that defy rational economic development,"" Margaret Williams, the head of the World Wildlife Fund's Arctic programs, said in a written statement. ""Shell's decision to abandon efforts to drill in this remote and extreme environment in 2014 means that Alaskan communities and wildlife will be able to go at least another year without the added threat of spills from exploratory drilling."" Shell began exploration in summer 2012. But it skipped 2013 after some high-profile snags, including the grounding of a drill barge that was being towed back to the continental U.S. at the end of the 2012 season. Smith said the company is frustrated by the obstacles it has faced but will continue working with the Department of the Interior while it reviews its options. ""Every year we are delayed from understanding the oil and gas resources under the Chukchi Sea only further delays the potential creation of tens of thousands of jobs, billions of dollars in tax revenue and much-needed new oil for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline,"" he said. The shrinking of Arctic sea ice, which hit record summer lows in 2012, has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region. Climate researchers say that decrease is a symptom of a warming climate, caused largely by the combustion of carbon-rich fossil fuels like oil -- a conclusion that's politically controversial but accepted as fact by most scientists. Shell's plans also were delayed by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, which killed 11 rig workers and unleashed an undersea gusher in the Gulf of Mexico that took three months to cap. The company says it's working at far less depth and lower pressures than those involved in that accident.","Shell says it lacks ""a clear path forward"" for drilling off Alaska .

"Most 911 centers can't receive text messages. But that doesn't always stop people from texting the familiar number in an emergency, not knowing their pleas for help won't be seen. A new initiative announced Friday will finally bring the 20-year-old SMS texting technology to emergency centers across the country in the coming years. The top four wireless carriers in the U.S. have agreed to speed up their efforts to support text-to-911 capabilities, making it available by May 15, 2014, according to a statement from the Federal Communications Commission released Friday. ""Access to 911 must catch up with how consumers communicate in the 21st century -- and today, we are one step closer towards that vital goal"" said FCC chairman Julius Genachowsk. Once the carriers are set up, local emergency response centers will still need the proper equipment, software and training, so the feature won't be available instantly. However, eventually the carriers and FCC hope to provide 90% of the population with text-to-911 features. The service will not support third-party texting apps or roaming users. In the meantime, the carriers will implement a much-needed alert message warning anyone who sends a text to 911 that their message was not received, and that they should make a phone call instead. That auto-reply system will be up and running by June 30, 2013. The carriers will handle support for texting until the national next-generation 911 service is completed in the next decade. Most 911 systems are managed locally, but the next-generation 911 project is a national push to update the systems to handle modern communications, including calls over the Internet, images and photos. One-third of the estimated 240 million calls to 911 are from wireless lines. Current systems do support the modern technology -- for example, some can pinpoint what tower a call was routed through to determine a caller's location -- but SMS text support has been more difficult.","The top four U.S. wireless carriers have agreed to support text-to-911 by 2014 .

"Kevin Ward Jr., a New York sprint car driver who was killed Saturday night after an on-track incident with NASCAR driver Tony Stewart, died of ""massive blunt trauma,"" authorities said Monday . Sheriff Philip C. Povero told reporters that the Ontario County medical examiner finished an autopsy on the 20-year-old driver on Monday. Povero also said investigators were reviewing a second video of the incident in which Stewart's car struck Ward as the young driver stood on the dirt track after a spin out. Ward died of his injuries before an ambulance arrived at a hospital. The sheriff said the investigation was progressing well, but gave no timeline as to when it would wrap up. He reiterated that there was no evidence at this point that a crime has been committed. Investigators spoke to Stewart's representatives on Monday, the sheriff said. Stewart was interviewed after the incident, authorities have said. On Saturday night, Ward's sprint car hit the outside wall during lap 14 of a 25-lap race put on by the Empire Super Sprints series at the Canandaigua Motorsports Park in upstate New York. A video of the incident shows two cars coming out of a turn with Stewart's No. 14 car sliding up the track toward Ward's No. 13 car. The two cars get close and appear to make contact before Ward's car hits the wall and spins out. Another car narrowly avoids hitting the 13 car as its sits on the track facing the wrong direction. Ward gets out of his crashed car and walks determinedly on the track toward the race cars, which had slowed for a yellow flag. Ward points a finger and appears to be yelling. One car swerves to avoid Ward on the half-mile dirt track. Stewart's car passes close to Ward, and it appears that its right rear tire hits him. The second video was taken from a different angle, the sheriff said without elaborating. Ward's funeral will be held Thursday, according to an update on the Empire Super Sprints website. ""The entire Ward family sends their sincere thanks to all that has send their heartfelt notes, calls, texts, anything that has been sent their way,"" the post says, adding the family is ""very proud of Kevin."" Stewart express sadness . ""There aren't words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr.,"" Stewart said Sunday, according to a written statement tweeted by NASCAR. ""It's a very emotional time for all involved. ... My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and everyone affected by this tragedy."" Stewart decided not to take part in Sunday's NASCAR event at Watkins Glen, New York. Whether he competes in this weekend's event is still undecided. ""The decision to compete in this weekend's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series event at Michigan will be Tony's, and he will have as much time as he needs to make that decision. It is still an emotional time for all involved, Tony included. He is grieving, and grief doesn't have a timetable,"" spokesman Mike Arning said. Opinion: Why Tony Stewart isn't likely to face charges in racetrack death . Ward began racing at 4 . Ward, from Port Leyden, New York, was in his fifth season in the Empire Super Sprints series. He began racing when he was 4, running go-kart events. A competitor who runs the car that swerved around Ward expressed sympathy. ""Our deepest condolences go to the entire Ward Family. We are one huge ESS family, you will be truly missed bud! #RIP13,"" Hebing Racing tweeted. Stewart is a three-time champion in NASCAR's top division and won a sprint car championship in 1995. He also owns a dirt race track in New Weston, Ohio, and has frequently raced sprint cars, even during the NASCAR season. He broke a leg last year in a sprint car crash that ended his racing season. He has raced the full NASCAR season this year but only returned to sprint cars in July. In 2013: Injuries as debris flies into Daytona stands during fiery NASCAR crash .

"(CNN) -- The length of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail is constantly changing. In 2010 the Appalachian Trail was officially 2,179.1 miles long. This year it's 2,181. In 2004 it was 2,173.9. The added distance is due to upgrades and repairs. (Not because your group had to backtrack a half-day because one of you left the keys to the vehicle parked at the end of the section in the vehicle parked at the start of the section.) The Appalachian Trail stretches from Springer Mountain, in north Georgia, to Katahdin, in central Maine, crossing 14 states and five national parks. The route is marked by white blazes on trees, posts and rocks. It's possible to hike the Appalachian Trail without a tent. There are more than 250 garage-size shelters ""roughly a day's hike apart"" along the length of the Appalachian Trail, according to Brian King of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, the nonprofit corporation that leads efforts to maintain the trail. That's a shelter about every 8 miles on average. They're free. So ""thru-hikers,"" people who walk the full distance in a continuous hike, often leave the tent at home, saving as much as 5 pounds from their backpacks. That's good, because that ""day's hike"" can be up to 30 miles, since shelters are built near sources of fresh water, King said. What's in an Appalachian Trail hiker's backpack? You won't see nearly as many animals as you'd expect. That's because most can hear, see or smell you long before you hear, see or smell them, and they'll flee. In the case of bears, wild pigs, raccoons and snakes, that's good. On hikes from Georgia through Connecticut, I have seen hundreds of birds, chipmunks and squirrels, spiders, a few deer, two wild turkeys as big as a washer and dryer, a wild pig, the backside of a bear running into the brush, and a rattlesnake lying across the trail warming itself in the morning sun. (Hint: It's less upsetting for all involved to hike around a timber rattler than to try to encourage it to move on by bouncing even a small stone off it.) Not wearing your glasses increases the number of animal sightings. But keep in mind that while without your glasses a tree stump can look like a bear, a bear also can look like a tree stump. But you might experience mice -- and it will be your fault. They congregate at shelters to feast on scraps left by hikers who don't follow the No. 1 rule of the Appalachian Trail: Leave no trace. And don't think that stowing your food in your pack means it's safe. We were awakened one night by a mouse that had gnawed through the pocket of a backpack and was wrestling with the wrapper of a snack bar inside. That's why shelters have ropes to hang packs up and away from small critters. Some also have ""bear boxes,"" lockers that keep food safe from larger beasts. The alternative is to hang your food in a stuff-sack from the branch of a tree. It's hard. Literally. Most of the Appalachian Trail is strewn with rocks. That makes sense, since the Appalachian Trail, for the most part, follows the ridge of the Appalachian Mountains. Still, it seems there are more rocks on the trail than off the trail. A running joke among our hiking group was that if you lose the trail, look for rocks; it'll be there. There are rocks you must climb over, rocks that stick out from the ground to slam your toes into or trip over, irregular rocks that force you to use foot and leg muscles to maintain balance with each step and rocks covered with mud or muck that are as slick as ice. It's a good idea to stow anything breakable, like a smartphone, at the top or to the back of your pack to keep it from breaking when you fall on your rear end. Downhill is worse than uphill. Hiking uphill carrying 20-30 pounds is strenuous, especially when it's a half-mile climb up large rocks. You've sweated out so much salt and potassium that you're experiencing the onset of hyponatremia, a condition in which you have difficulty using your muscles and may even experience some confusion (different from ""Why am I doing this? What was I thinking?"" which are coherent thoughts). Resting and a salty snack with water help. But on a steep downhill, your knee takes more impact. After some distance, each step is painful. Trekking poles and walking slowly can ease some of the discomfort. But knee damage is possible. An estimated 12,000 people have hiked the full length of the Appalachian Trail since it was completed in 1937. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy's King says it usually takes from five to seven months. The numbers are derived from sign-in sheets at either end of the trail and at conservancy headquarters at the unofficial midway point in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, as well as from ""ridge runners,"" who keep an eye on logbooks at shelters in their area. But there is no requirement to sign in or out, and many don't. ""So who knows what the variable is?"" King said. Those who have hiked the Appalachian Trail ""know they've done it,"" King said. Hikers usually are known by ""trail names"" they give themselves or earn, like Marty ""Wounded Knee"" Raffay (See ""Downhill is worse than uphill""). Detailed maps, books and other information about the trail are available through the Appalachian Trail Conservancy website. The trail is maintained by volunteers. Last year some 6,200 volunteers, led by members of 31 official Appalachian Trail maintaining clubs, worked 210,000 hours repairing trails, painting blazes and maintaining shelters, privies and wells, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. The conservancy is staffed by 44 paid workers year-round and 12 to 15 seasonal workers, King said. Volunteers often give up some of their vacation so hikers can use some of theirs on the Appalachian Trail. ""Trail magic"" comes from"" trail angels."" Trail magic is an unexpected act of kindness or generosity. It can be as simple as a day hiker giving a thru-hiker a candy bar or as grand as volunteers setting up a grill near a road crossing and passing out hot dogs. The little things are missed most. Anne Sharp, aka ""Margolo,"" and Travis Olson, aka ""Chaco Taco,"" are thru-hiking with Willett, a German shepherd, unofficially aka ""Dog Quixote"" (he occasionally chases imaginary threats in the woods, Sharp said). ""We feel an immense appreciation for the simple experiences we rarely get these days,"" she e-mailed from the Appalachian Trail somewhere in New England. ""Drinking coffee from a mug, having a chair to sit on, dry clothes after a storm. ..."" Follow ""Margolo,"" ""Chaco Taco"" and Willett's thru hike. One day hiking is better therapy than a year of visits to the shrink. After an hour of wisecracks (""Are we there yet?"" ""Oh, good, more rocks."" ""Did you bring the beer?"") as the day's hike begins, we settle into a quiet time alone in the woods with our thoughts. (Are we there yet? Oh, good, more rocks. I wish I had a beer.) It's also better than a day in the gym. At my weight, 127 pounds soaking wet (which is what I was after a 16-mile hike in 14 miles of rain), carrying a 30-pound pack burns about 450 calories an hour. You can trap thru-hikers with beer. ""Samurai"" was planning to catch up with some buddies at the next shelter when he ran into our group at the Wiley Shelter near Webatuck, New York. We had just come back from a 6-mile round-trip excursion into town to buy, um, supplies. Instead of hurrying to his friends, he spent the next few hours sitting with us around the ""backpackers' TV,"" roasting marshmallows and singing Irish pub songs. If a shelter is near enough to a road and to a town, it's not unusual to see a pizza delivery or two. That's why a smartphone with GPS is essential; you can use it to find towns near the trail and supplies. The world is your toilet ... as long as it's a ""cathole"" at least 6 inches deep and 200 feet from a trail, campsite or water source. Please pack out the paperwork or file it away at the site and cover it all with dirt. Remember: Leave no trace. Most shelters have privies. The more pleasant of these are composting outhouses, which require users to do a bit of yard work before use. They work by adding a handful of dirt after each visit. The dirt, called ""duff,"" is the layer of soil and mold just beneath the layer of leaves on the forest floor.","The length of the Appalachian Trail is constantly changing .

"(CNN) -- A woman whose body was found in the crawl space of an Oregon home -- the mother of a newborn who also died -- died from ""homicidal violence,"" the state's deputy medical examiner said Monday. Police released a photo of Korena Roberts, who is charged with murder. An autopsy showed causes of 21-year-old Heather Snively's death included blunt-force trauma and ""sharp-force injuries,"" Dr. Christopher Young said. Sharp-force injuries mean cut or stab wounds. Young said additional information will not be released until test results are received. Korena Roberts, 28, is charged with murder in Snively's death. She was scheduled to appear in court Monday afternoon. Medics received a call Friday from Roberts' Washington County, Oregon, home of a newborn in distress, authorities said. When they arrived, they found Roberts' boyfriend trying to revive the baby boy. Roberts told deputies the baby was hers, according to the county sheriff's office. Roberts and the baby were taken to a hospital after medics noticed a lot of blood at the home, officials said. ""Doctors at the hospital could not revive the baby,"" said sheriff's Sgt. David Thompson. ""They also discovered that Ms. Roberts had not delivered the baby at any time in the recent past."" Deputies returned to the home and found Snively's body in a crawl space beneath the kitchen. Police said she had been pregnant; authorities determined she was the baby's mother. ""At this time, it has not been determined if [Snively] died because of head wounds she received or as a result of cutting injuries she received to her abdomen,"" said a Monday statement from the Washington County, Oregon, Sheriff's Office. ""The autopsy determined that Ms. Snively's son was removed from her womb after she had been cut open."" Additional testing is needed to determine whether the infant died before or after he was removed from Snively's body, the statement said. Roberts had been telling friends and family for months that she was pregnant, police said, and had told many of those people, including her live-in boyfriend, that she was carrying twins. Young said an autopsy was completed on the baby, but he would not release information Monday. Authorities said Sunday the outcome of the autopsy could result in another murder charge against Roberts. Heidi Kidd, Snively's mother, told CNN affiliate KPTV that her daughter met Roberts on Craigslist, a classified ads Web site, and the two were to exchange baby clothes. Residents in Roberts' neighborhood told KPTV that she had told them she was expecting a child. ""She didn't appear to be pregnant to us,"" neighbor Doug King told the station. Police think Roberts may have had contact with numerous pregnant women in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area, the statement said, and police ask anyone who has had contact with her, either in person or over the Internet, to call the Washington County Sheriff's Office. Roberts' boyfriend is cooperating with police, and has not been charged in the case, authorities said. Washington County is about 30 miles west of Portland, Oregon.

"Raising a young family while juggling a career is a tough act to master at the best of times. Doing so aboard a 15-meter yacht, hemmed in by the thick ocean ice of one of the harshest environments on earth must surely complicate matters a whole lot more. But Eric Brossier wouldn't have it any other way. The French oceanographer and his wife, France, have spent the past eight winters happily recording scientific data across the northern polar-regions while living aboard a specially equipped yacht fittingly called Le Vagabond. Since 2007, the couple have been accompanied by their eldest daughter, Leonie (now six) and, since 2009, her younger sister Aurora (now three). ""It's not an ordinary life,"" he explained from the lower deck of the vessel-come-family home. ""Outside is minus 27 degrees and we won't see the sun for at least a few more weeks. ""[But we] love the wildlife, the mountains, sailing in between the ice, the mix of pack ice drifting with icebergs next to glaciers,"" he added. See also: Fine sailing art graces London in the snow . Brossier has carried out a raft of seasonal studies near the remote island of Spitsbergen, Norway, and around coastal Greenland in recent years. Polar bears, walruses and an array of spectacular arctic creatures have proved more regular company than people during these trips, which can last between six months and a year at a time. This year, however, the family headed further west and dropped anchor outside the remote Inuit town of Grise Fiord in the Canadian Arctic. The trip marks the first time they have set up camp close to a human settlement. ""The main reasons we decided to come here this winter was so that our eldest daughter could go to school and our youngest daughter could socialize with other kids her own age,"" Brossier said. ""Without kids we'd probably live a couple of kilometers further out just to feel nature a little bit more. ""Still, the town only has a population of around 120 people and we can head out if we wish on snow mobile or with dogs,"" he added. See also: Superyacht doubles as a science lab . Although Grise Fiord represents the most northerly civilian settlement in North America, Brossier explains that the town is still privy to the comforts of contemporary western life. Homes have central heating, running water and access to the internet, with Facebook being one of the most popular modes of communication -- a far cry from the spartan existence of Inuit communities in Greenland and northern Russia. Yet these modern trappings provide the Brossiers with a happy medium between the Arctic wilderness the family so adores, suitable schooling facilities and viable long-term research work. Brossier says his current assignment is based around the earth's changing climate. He is paid to measure the thickness of the winter ice, ocean currents and weather patterns in and around Grise Fiord for research institutions in Toronto and Vancouver. In previous years however, he has acted as a guide for television and documentary crews. ""We decide where to go according to the job offered to us or the measurements we have to take,"" he said. ""If we can find such projects in the future that meet our work needs and the needs of our children then we may be able to carry on for five or ten years,"" he added. But while enthusiastic about adventures the future may hold, Brossier is aware that others -- especially those with young children -- may find his nomadic lifestyle in the Arctic chill less than appealing. He admits there are things he misses from time to time but would advise any avid scientist, sailor or adventurer keen to experience the far north to set sail and experience it for themselves. See also: Computer hackers conquer high seas . ""We miss our friends and families and when we go back to France for a few weeks every year that is what we like to see first,"" he said.

"Washington (CNN)Julia Pierson, the first female director of the Secret Service, resigned Wednesday in the aftermath of a fence-jumper gaining access to the White House on September 19 and a subsequent congressional inquiry uncovering other security lapses. Homeland Security Director Jeh Johnson announced the resignation in a statement. He also announced that the Department of Homeland Security would take over an internal inquiry of the Secret Service and that he would appoint of a new panel to review security at the White House. Joseph Clancy, formerly a special agent in charge of the Presidential Protective Division of the Secret Service, was named interim director, Johnson said in his statement. Calls for Pierson to leave her post grew after a poor performance during her testimony Tuesday on Capitol Hill and another bombshell revelation the same day that an armed security contractor was allowed to get into an elevator with the President during a recent trip to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Even some high-ranking Democrats had turned against Pierson, who was in the job for less than two years. In an interview on Wednesday, Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, where Tuesday's hearing took place, said he thought Pierson -- who he referred to as ""this lady"" -- ""has to go."" The Maryland congressman reiterated this stance in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""I want her to go if she cannot restore trust in the agency and if she cannot get the culture back in order,"" he said. Secret Service director testimony omits elevator incident with Obama . And New York's Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, had announced he would call for Pierson's resignation on Wednesday as well, though that was later canceled. Republicans also had called for Pierson to step down. ""It's clear to me that the only way to solve the problem the Secret Service has is with new leadership,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said. ""What Julia Pierson describes as mistakes are major security failures on multiple fronts."" Graham said light security around Obama is ""the worst possible signal to send to terrorists and our enemies around the world."" After news of her resignation broke, lawmakers praised her decision to step down. ""The agency tasked with protecting the highest office in our land should be the crown jewel of federal law enforcement,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who sits on the Oversight Committee, said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. ""I will work with my colleagues and the Administration towards returning the agency back to the standards the President deserves."" News of Pierson's resignation came as new information about the fence-jumper came to light. Omar Gonzalez, 42, pleaded not guilty to federal and District of Columbia charges on Wednesday. A federal judge in Washington ordered additional mental testing on the 42-year-old Iraq war veteran to determine whether he is competent to stand trial. Fence jumper made it into East Room of White House . Meanwhile, the inquiry continues into how the Army veteran launched over the fence and was able to sprint up to the front door, burst into the White House and run into the ornate East Room. Neither President Barack Obama nor the first family were at home at the time of the incident. But a Secret Service source told CNN there is an elaborate closed-circuit video system, and that video is being dissected to establish new protocols. When Gonzalez burst through the White House door, he pushed a female officer to the side. But the source said, ""Gender was not a factor, she got one door secured but was pushed over while trying to get second door shut."" An alarm box had been turned down near the front door after complaints by the White House usher's office that it was too loud. A canine unit was not released to chase Gonzalez, said the source, because there were ""too many friendlies around."" Secret Service vague with details to federal court following fence-jumper arrest . Pierson was named the director of the U.S. Secret Service in March 2013, tapped by Obama to change the culture of an agency that was then marred by a Colombian prostitution scandal. Several male agents in an advance contingent before a presidential trip to Cartagena, Colombia, had taken prostitutes back to their hotel rooms, according to investigations after the trip. A morning-after dispute between one agent and a woman over payment led to exposure of what happened and the ensuing investigations. Nine agents eventually left or lost their jobs . Pierson became the Secret Service's chief of staff in 2008. Before that, she served on the protective details of Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. She had been the assistant director of the agency's Office of Human Resources and Training, and held the title of deputy assistant director in the Office of Protective Operations and the Office of Administration. Who is Julia Pierson? Pierson started her career in law enforcement as a police officer in Orlando, Florida. She joined the Secret Service in 1983, working in the Miami and Orlando field offices. Johnson made sure to praise the overall work of the Secret Service when he announced Pierson's resignation. ""It is worth repeating that the Secret Service is one of the finest official protection services in the world, consisting of men and women who are highly trained and skilled professionals prepared to put their own lives on the line in a second's notice for the people they protect.""

"(CNN) -- When my airplane touched down in Birmingham, Alabama, I could not stop grinning. The trip last weekend fulfilled a lifelong dream to visit all 50 states. At age 31, I reached my goal. Alabama may not be at the top of many travel wish lists -- it wasn't on mine -- but its layered history offers many memorable experiences. I took an airport selfie right away, holding a map of the USA on which I proudly wrote, ""I've been to ALL 50 states!"" It's a map my dad pulled out of a phone book when I was a kid, penciling in the year we checked off each state. I've carried that simple map along on my travels, slowly filling it in. Collecting states is a family tradition. My sister Mary reached 50 states when she was 21 and two of my uncles reached it in their 40s. My father has been to 49 states and my mother has been to 48. By the time I was a year old, I had been to 10 states, and by the time I was seven, I'd visited 25. Over the past four years, I've traveled frequently for work, often visiting 20 to 25 states a year, and I have been to most states multiple times. There's a lot of debate around what counts as a visit. Some people believe you need to stay overnight or eat a meal. Others count airport layovers. In my family, we say you need to stand on the ground in the state. Despite all of my travel, I've had to make a handful of dashes across a border to cross off a state still on my list, but even those trips create lasting memories. When I was 22, my cousin Maureen drove my sister, other relatives and me from her home in Memphis across the borders of Mississippi and Arkansas. The occasion for our visit was very sad: Her mother had just died from ovarian cancer. But driving us to neighboring states is what her mom would have done if she were alive to help us with our goal, Maureen said. For North Dakota, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, I tacked solo road trips onto business travel in neighboring states, driving up to 600 miles round-trip just to check off a state. In the other 45 states, I've spent time meeting people who live there, sampling the food and the local attractions. I've had Whoopie pies in Maine, Skyline Chili in Ohio, hush puppies in North Carolina, fried dill pickles in Texas, huckleberry ice cream in Montana and poke in Hawaii. 50 states, 50 spots for 2014 . I've lived in seven states from coast to coast, and I don't identify any one of them as home. The nation is my home, with its diverse landscapes, communities and landmarks. Plus, a college degree in history heightened my curiosity about the places I've studied. History is filled with a mixture of tragedy and triumph, and Alabama certainly fits. Capping off my American tour in Alabama was a meaningful way to end, but in truth visiting Heart of Dixie last was accidental. I thought a trip to a wedding in Hawaii with my partner Mark in January would fulfill my goal and I even bragged about it on Facebook. But then I dug up my dad's map on the day of our flight and saw that both Alabama and New Mexico were blank. Oops. So the quest continued. I visited New Mexico in February and my mom said she'd meet me in Alabama in May. She flew from Florida while I came from Virginia. We planned a trip centered around heroines of history and literature. In Montgomery, we stood at the very spot where Rosa Parks boarded the racially segregated bus in 1955 and refused to give up her seat. A number of other women, many of whom worked at the nearby university, had been brainstorming a bus boycott and jumped into action that night. After 13 months, their boycott worked. We drove down to Monroeville, the hometown of Harper Lee, where we watched a play based on her 1960 book ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" at the courthouse that inspired the setting in her book. The 1903 courthouse is now a museum with exhibits about Lee and her famous neighbor Truman Capote. This literary classic ranks among my favorite books, and it felt likes stepping back in time to see the volunteer actors perform it in Lee's hometown. Before the performance, we followed a walking tour map to Mel's Dairy Bar, the spot where Lee's childhood home had once stood and paid silent homage to her. The literary tour continued in Irondale because my mom and I love the Towanda-power of the movie ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" (1991) and the book that inspired it, ""Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop CafÃ©"" (1987) by Fannie Flagg. Flagg's great aunt co-owned the Irondale CafÃ©, which was the inspiration for the fictional cafÃ©. As a steady stream of trains whistled by, we tucked into greasy, tasty fried green tomatoes and other Southern cuisine. Back in Birmingham, we took another look at some of the state's most troubling past at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church -- where four girls died in a bombing -- and Kelly Ingram Park -- where white people attacked unarmed black children protesting segregation. Both events occurred in 1963 at the height of the civil rights movement. Visiting the sites highlighted for us the bravery of those seeking equality and the brutality of those who opposed them. We spent hours at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. When we started, there were students running all around us, noisily doing a scavenger hunt, but by the end, we were alone, absorbed in the exhibits. . From slavery to segregation to the heroic tactics to end it, the institute tells the gripping, moving story of change through printed words, audio clips and film. Women were appropriately honored for their crucial role, especially their on-the-ground organizing, something that too many history books and people overlook. From visiting national parks and historic landmarks to meeting kind and interesting people in big cities and small towns alike, I've had many memorable trips. But learning more about and honoring women I admire, both real and fictional, with the added benefit of spending time with my mother, puts the Alabama weekend near the top of the list. And of course, thanks to this trip I finally have the bragging rights to say I've been to all 50 states! Do you have a 50-state goal?

"Diver Brian Tovin swam deep into South Carolina's Cooper River in search of fossils and relics. In 40 feet of murky water, fighting the current, something shiny caught his eye. ""Without even shining my light on it, it was clear that it has weight to it, and it was metal or gold,"" Tovin said. ""And when I shined my light on it, I said, wow, this is the first time I've ever found jewelry underneath the water,"" he said. But it was more than just jewelry. It was a ring that had become the ""stuff of legend"" since the owner lost it nearly 40 years ago. ""I held onto it for the rest of the dive. I just didn't want to lose it,"" Tovin said. Inscribed on the large, gold ring were the initials RLP and the date 1974. The ring also displayed the name of a nearby school: the College of Charleston. With those clues, Tovin's journey to return the jewelry began. The hunt for RLP . Tovin first called the college's alumni association. The college determined that only two people who graduated in 1974 had those initials, and one was female. Now, Tovin knew who he was looking for: Robert LeVaughn Phillips. After searching on social media, Tovin eventually connected with Robert's son, Eric Phillips. Tovin quizzed him to make sure he had tracked down the rightful owner.  Phillips e-mailed a copy of his father's diploma, and Tovin was convinced he was in the right place. Tovin soon learned that like so many other things in life, this very simple college ring -- lost for so many years -- had more meaning to it than many will ever understand. UK airport tries to find century-old lost teddy's family . Another man's treasure . ""My dad was a storyteller, kind of a used-car salesman at times,"" Eric Phillips said. ""He kind of has some of the same jokes, but he talked about the ring all the time because it came from his mother, and you know it's just one of the stories that just epitomized a season of his life,"" he told CNN. Robert Phillips was boating on the Cooper River with his future wife, Nancy, when he lost the ring in 1974 -- just two weeks after he got it. ""He was very upset and hated to tell his mom that he lost it,"" Nancy Phillips said. ""Losing it in the river, we never thought we would never, ever, ever see it again,"" she told CNN. A symbol of success . Growing up without his father in his life, Robert Phillips was determined to succeed on his own. He graduated from the College of Charleston with a degree in business administration. The ring, a symbol of all he had accomplished, was his mother's last gift to him before she passed away from pancreatic cancer. Tovin hoped he could return the cherished ring to Phillips at his home, but Phillips -- now fighting cancer -- was not there. He was rushed into surgery at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston last weekend for brain surgery. That setback didn't stop a reunion 39 years in the making. A few days after Phillips' operation, Tovin met Phillips in the hospital. With his family by his side, Phillips sat in a hospital chair. His voice was barely above a whisper, but it was full of life as a stranger returned a part of his life to him. Down on one knee, Tovin opened up a ring box to reveal Phillips's lost treasure. ""I was down there fighting strong currents and alligators trying to get you your ring back,"" said Tovin, as Phillips smiled. ""And I've got it here, and I know this is going to look like I'm proposing to you, so please don't tell my wife, OK,"" he said, as the room erupted in laughter. ""Wow. That is awesome,"" Phillips said. How was a class ring found after 13 years? Coming full circle . Then, Phillips began to tell Tovin and everyone the story that his family has heard endlessly -- the story of the lost ring. ""I was on the back of the boat. And I decided I needed a beer,"" he said softly. ""I pulled the pop top and when I did, my finger got caught in the pop top, and it went with it,"" he told Tovin. ""I guess I have to go have it sized now, don't I,"" he added with a grin. ""You've got a lot of years left.  So, you're going to be wearing that ring,"" Tovin responded. With his wife and two children watching this reunion of sorts, they all felt this ring would give their patriarch the comfort he needs right now. ""No matter how much time he has with us, we'll always have that ring. And it will always signify a good season of our life and a good memory of our father, and the fact that he got to share in it before he left us,"" Eric Phillips said. In some ways, this decades-long loop of life has been closed, and a new story -- one that the Phillips family will be telling for generations -- has been written. ""Thank you Lord that I got it back,"" Robert Phillips said. ""I had a nightmare the other night that I lost it again,"" he said. ""No more beer cans,"" he laughed.","Brian Tovin finds ring while diving in the Cooper River .

"Your co-workers will bolt from work early today. Bars will make a killing. And even the most indifferent of your friends will feign a slight interest in the World Cup. For today, the United States begins its Brazil adventure when it goes toe-to-toe with its nemesis, Ghana. The Black Stars have knocked the U.S. out of competition the last two go-rounds -- in 2006 and 2010. Can the U.S. avoid a three-peat? It'd better, if it wants to see its World Cup ambitions stay alive. Because after Ghana, the U.S. takes on two giants: Germany and Portugal -- ranked by FIFA as the second- and fourth-best teams in the world. For its part, the U.S. is ranked 13th. Ghana is 37th. No wonder Group G -- the one the U.S. finds itself in -- has been nicknamed the ""Group of Death."" Why focus on the negative though? Sure, America's odds of lifting the most coveted soccer trophy in the world are 100 to 1. But the 23 players on the squad have dreamed of playing on the grandest stage of soccer since they were kids. Kyle Beckerman, 32, was one of them. As a child, he'd leave notes for his mom, signed, ""Kyle Beckerman USA #15."" Now, he signs autographs that way. This is their moment. ""For one month every four years, the world stops, everybody is watching,"" said team captain Michael Bradley. ""To have the opportunity to represent our country, to wear our colors, there's nothing else like it."" WHY YOU SHOULD WORRY . Ghana hasn't been kind to America's World Cup soccer aspirations. It knocked out the U.S. from the group stage in 2006 with a 2-1 win. In 2010, the Americans gave them a run for the money. But alas, an extra-time goal from Ghana -- in the 93rd minute -- sent the U.S. packing once again, 2-1. Seven players from the 2010 Ghanaian team are back Monday, including the lightning-fast Asamoah Gyan, the team captain. They're unpredictable. And the U.S. will have to be ready for anything. WHY YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY . In the warm-up matches ahead of the tournament, the U.S. won all three of its games -- against Azerbaijan, Turkey and Nigeria. Ghana lost two of its three -- to Montenegro and the Netherlands. (It beat fellow World Cup participant South Korea handily.) Second, none of the U.S. players is hobbled by injury. One of Ghana's best, Michael Essien, is. He'll start the match against the U.S. on the bench as will Kevin-Prince Boateng, who scored against the Americans in 2010. Finally, it's very, very wet and rainy in Natal, where the game will be played. ""When there's rain in a soccer game, it means that it's pretty much an equalizer a lot of the time,"" says CNN correspondent Lara Baldesarra. ""Anything can happen."" WHO TO WATCH . Ghana's Ayew brothers. There are two of them: Andrew and Jordan. They're fast and they're a threat -- especially Jordan Ayew, who has worked his way into the starting lineup against the United States. When Ghana beat South Korea in the warm-up, he scored all the goals but one in the 4-0 wipeout. This, after coming in as a substitute! On the U.S. side, hopes are riding high on 26-year-old Michael Bradley, the best American midfielder of his generation. He's creative and attack-minded. Look for him to come up with some dazzling plays. Then there's goalie Tim Howard. He's one of the best in the world. Oh, and he scores too -- the way he did for Manchester United in a Premier League match against Bolton Wanderers. WHO WON'T BE THERE . Landon Donovan, the all-time top U.S. goal scorer (57). For fans, coach Jurgen Klinsmann's decision to leave him out doesn't add up. Klinsmann said other players were ""a tiny little bit ahead of him,"" and though he didn't want to go into details, he alluded to the 32-year-old Donovan not having the speed and ankle-breaking one-on-one skills he once possessed. WHAT SHOULD YOU IGNORE . Klinsmann, a tough-talking German who won a World Cup himself, took over from Bob Bradley as the U.S. coach in 2011. All his work has been building up to this moment. So fans weren't too pleased when they heard him say this: . ""For us now talking about winning a World Cup, it's just not realistic. First we've got to make it through the group. So let's keep our feet on the ground and say, let's get that group first done, and then the sky is the limit."" There's another way to look at it. Maybe he's managing expectations. Or using reverse psychology. Best to ignore it. After all, Klinsmann himself struck a more optimistic note Sunday. ""We wanna go far, that's definitely our goal,"" he said. ""I booked my flight after the final."" WHO WILL WIN . Depends on the counterattacks. The Ghana players are fast and nimble. The Americans are creative at seizing opportunities.

"(CNN) -- The warnings seem almost ubiquitous today in this world of Doppler Radar and instant communication, but the word ""tornado"" actually used to be banned in weather forecasts. Before the 1950s, there were no warnings that a tornado was about to occur. ""That's when the warning system we have now was just being developed,"" said Bob Henson of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. ""Most Americans never got a tornado warning,"" he said. But what about radar? ""There was no radar,"" he said. Before that, Americans had to endure decades of agonizing blows from Mother Nature, many of the victims taken unaware. In 1882, 17 years after the Civil War ended, U.S. Army Signal Corps Sgt. John P. Finley was asked to investigate tornadoes and how they developed. As Finley was doing his research, tornado forecasting came to a screeching halt when the Signal Corps banned the word ""tornado"" from official forecasts because they were concerned the word would cause widespread panic. ""They literally avoided the word up until the 1950s or so,"" Henson said. ""They were a little concerned about the panic or the tools weren't strong enough to predict them,"" he said, ""and quite frankly without radar, you couldn't forecast them."" Twisters were not measured in the same way they are now. Thus, experts now don't know whether the 1925 Tri-State tornado -- which killed about 695 people when it tore through Missouri, Illinois and Indiana -- was actually a single funnel or many, which is why it isn't officially considered the deadliest single tornado. Tornadoes by the month: 1950-2011 . So the emphasis went on observing and reporting rather than forecasting. The U.S. Weather Bureau started reporting tornadoes, thunderstorms, hailstorms, lightning and high winds at a few experimental locations across the United States in spring 1943. Gradually, forecasters started issuing forecasts for severe thunderstorms, but could not tell the time nor place. As for tornado forecasts? Still off-limits. A breakthrough happened in the late 1940s, when two Air Force officers identified conditions that were favorable for tornado formation in the southern Plains. The first tornado forecast was issued March 20, 1948. Six hours later, a twister slammed into Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma. The tornado caused $6 million in damage, but no one was killed, thanks to a tornado safety plan that was implemented at the base after the forecast was issued. Joplin tornado sets deadly record . The tornado bulletin brought the Air Force attention from the public and local media. However, tornado forecasts were only available to Air Force weather offices and were still not issued by the Weather Bureau. Then came Radio Detection and Ranging, or radar. During World War II, radar was invented to detect enemy ships and aircraft. Radar operators soon began to notice that rain would often obscure aircraft. This led to using radar to detect storms that could produce tornadoes. Finally, in 1950, the ban on the word ""tornado"" in weather forecasts was lifted. That was the same year official federal records about tornadoes -- in terms of their location, strength and damage inflicted -- were first kept. In 1953, the U.S. Weather Bureau established the Severe Local Storms Center, known as SELS. The first tornado watches issued by SELS usually covered an average area of 27,000 square miles. Today, tornado and severe thunderstorm watches average 25,000 square miles. In 1966, SELS was renamed the National Severe Storms Forecast Center. At this time, tornado and severe thunderstorm forecasts were renamed ""watches"" to correspond with products issued by the National Hurricane Center. In the early 1990s, Doppler Weather Radar, or as it was more commonly known, Next Generation Weather Radar, was deployed at local National Weather Service forecast offices nationwide. Doppler radar allowed forecasters to see more than just precipitation. With the new radar, they could actually detect wind circulations within storms that could lead to tornado formation. Doppler weather radar was part of a wider modernization of forecast offices nationwide lasting nearly a decade. ""Today forecasters use a comprehensive system (to detect storms) but radar is the foundation because radar detects the circulation of winds that form tornadoes,"" Henson said. ""Hand in hand with that are people on the ground who are trained storm-spotters. You always need eyes on the storm,"" he said. After the deployment of Doppler weather radar, lead times for tornadoes were nearly doubled, from less than five minutes to around 10 to 13 minutes. In October 1995, the National Severe Storms Forecast Center was renamed the Storm Prediction Center, and as part of the weather service's modernization program, the Storm Prediction Center was moved to Norman, Oklahoma. Today, the Storm Prediction Center issues forecasts for severe thunderstorms as far as eight days out and is tasked with issuing severe thunderstorm and tornado watches in the United States. Tornado warnings are issued by local National Weather Service forecast offices. Even though forecasters can now identify conditions favorable for tornadoes, they still cannot predict exactly when and where tornadoes will touch down. There lies the rub. Officials in Joplin, Missouri, confirmed at least 116 people dead after a twister smashed the city Sunday. Destructive tornadoes and severe storms tore through the South in late April, killing hundreds of people. With all the advancements in storm technology, the question is simple: Why? ""That's the question of 2011,"" Henson said. ""Why have so many people died in these tornadoes? That's the open question. It's partly because of the strength of these tornadoes. Also because they've hit populated areas."" While tools such as Doppler Radar detect winds within severe storms that could indicate a tornado may be imminent, many of these rotating storms do not go on to produce tornadoes. Although tornado forecasting has remarkably improved over the last two decades with advanced forecasting techniques, weather satellites, numerical forecast models and Doppler weather radar, there is much about tornado forecasting that still remains a mystery. Journalist Craig Johnson contributed to this report.","U.S. Weather Bureau started reporting severe weather at a few U.S. locations in 1943 .

"In September 2005, I found out I was eight weeks pregnant with my first child. Everything was fine -- better than fine. I was working full time, working out with a personal trainer, and in the gym on my own every day -- sometimes for two hours. All this was cleared by my doctor, as this had been my normal routine for almost two years. In my 12th week, I started to feel a little queasy in the morning. My doctor advised me that I should probably try eating a little more, but that it would pass eventually. I never would have dreamed that it would be 18 weeks and a lot of heartache later before it subsided. Catherine and William baby news sparks media frenzy . I went from feeling queasy to not being able to hold down water and struggling just to brush my teeth. I started to plan my life around when and where I was going to feel sick. I learned not to go to the meat department in the grocery store, and to travel with grocery bags lined with napkins in my car. When I woke up, I figured out that I could not open my eyes too quickly or my head would begin spinning, making me dizzy -- and eventually making me sick. I lost my voice because my throat was burned from acid. I even started making a pallet on my bathroom floor to sleep on because I didn't have the energy to keep getting up and going to the bathroom. Concerned, I went back to the doctor. As my primary doctor was on leave, I saw another doctor. She told me that a lot of women come in with these symptoms and sometimes they just have to ""suck it up,"" and that since I had heard about morning sickness, it was probably in my head all the time anyway. She made me feel like I was crazy. But when my primary doctor returned, I was diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum -- the same condition that put Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, in the hospital. Then came the parade of medicines. I started with Zofran, an anti-nausea medication commonly given to cancer patients, but I couldn't keep the pill down long enough for it to work. Next was a drug called Reglan, compounded and applied topically on my wrists. The side effects made me feel as if I had a constant hangover, and I couldn't stay awake -- then, it stopped working altogether. The princess and the puke: A fellow sufferer's view . By this time, I was 20 weeks pregnant and I had lost 20 pounds. I found out my child was a boy and he was healthy, but I worried neither one of us would make it. A feeding tube and hospitalization entered the discussion -- my doctor said there was no choice unless I was able to gain 5 pounds in a month. I had already been to the ER so many times for dehydration, I knew most of the nurses by first name and they knew me. The last resort before hospitalization was a subcutaneous IV delivering anti-nausea medication 24 hours a day under my skin. By this time, I was out of work on bed rest. I was drowning in my illness. Life as I had known it was over. I had a home nurse who came to once a week to give me IV fluids in my home. I had a full IV stand that I could wheel around my house. My nurse taught me how to insert the IV into my thigh and change the medicine every two days. It took a week, but slowly I began to feel a change for the better. The medicine decreased to every three days and finally, when I was 30 weeks pregnant, I was taken off. Then one day, it was over. I woke up without medication, without dizziness and without being sick. I was almost scared, but it was over. I stopped feeling nauseous and I was able to gain all the weight I lost and what I should have gained in the last eight weeks of my pregnancy.

"(CNN) -- A commercial rocket company has announced plans to go where no other has gone before. Elon Musk, founder and CEO of Space X, said Tuesday that his company is building a rocket big enough to carry more cargo than any space vehicle ever built except the Saturn V moon rocket. Musk made the announcement during a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington. The rocket -- called Falcon Heavy -- will arrive at the Vandenberg Air Force Base launch pad in California in November or December of next year and should be ready for its first test flight in late 2013, Musk said. Space X is in talks, he said, with several countries, including the United States, and private companies interested in using Falcon Heavy. Space X is paying for all the development costs leading up to and including the first test launch. Musk told CNN it will cost somewhere between $300 million and $500 million. No paying customers have come forward so far for the first test launch, Musk said. ""We have lots of customers for the second, third and fourth launch,"" he said, ""but they didn't have the risk appetite for the first flight."" Space X says the first launches will take place at Vandenberg but eventually Kennedy Space Center in Florida also will be used.  Musk said his company is talking with NASA about using one of the two space shuttle launch pads for his new rocket. He said production of Falcon Heavy should create a couple hundred jobs in Florida and California. Overall, Musk said, he expects a couple thousand jobs to be added during the next two years in Florida, California and Texas. Musk told CNN he decided to build the heavy lift rocket because he needed it to put bigger satellites into orbit than his smaller Falcon 9 rocket can handle. Musk said he believes his new rocket will be capable of putting large payloads into orbit for $1,000 dollars per pound.  The lowest current cost is roughly $6,000 per pound. Musk told CNN he wants to bring ""revolutionary change, not evolutionary change, to the space business."" This rocket, he says, is revolutionary. ""The public should be very excited about this.  It re-establishes U.S. leadership in space,"" he said. Falcon Heavy also will be able to carry humans to the moon or perhaps Mars, Musk said. Because Falcon Heavy won't be as big as the old Saturn V, more than one rocket would be needed to carry out those missions. For a mission to the moon, for instance, one rocket would carry the lander and another would be for the crew and command module. Space X already has a contract for a dozen cargo flights to the International Space Station using the smaller Falcon 9.  That rocket has already flown two successful test flights and, barring setbacks, should begin the cargo flights next year. Space X is also in the running to replace the space shuttle program for ferrying astronauts to the space station.","It can carry more cargo than any space vehicle ever built except the Saturn V moon rocket .

"The Manhattan clinic where Joan Rivers suffered cardiac arrest disputed a report that it happened during a biopsy of her vocal cords. A spokesman for the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic gave CNN its first public statement since Rivers fell ill during a procedure. While federal privacy laws limit what medical providers can make public, the statement counters a New York newspaper report quoting an unidentified source saying a doctor made a ""spur-of-the-moment"" decision ""to take a scalpel to a polyp-like growth on her vocal cord."" ""A biopsy of the vocal cords has never been performed at Yorkville Endoscopy,"" the clinic's statement said. Rivers, 81, died last Thursday in New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, where she was rushed a week earlier after she stopped breathing and her heart stopped beating during treatment at Yorkville Endoscopy. Many questions have been raised about what that treatment was given and what might have gone wrong that led to the comedian's death.  Few answers have been made public because of medical privacy rules, but the New York State Health Department confirmed the agency is investigating. The clinic statement also seemed to address speculation that her cardiac arrest could have been related to the anesthesia used to sedate Rivers while an endoscope, which is a long, flexible camera, was used to examine her throat. ""General anesthesia has never been administered at Yorkville Endoscopy,"" the statement said. ""The type of sedation used at Yorkville Endoscopy is monitored anesthesia care.  Our anesthesiologists utilize light to moderate sedation."" Only licensed medical doctors who are board-certified anesthesiologists administer anesthesia at the clinic, the statement said. ""Our anesthesiologists monitor the patient continuously utilizing state-of-the-art monitoring equipment, and remain at the bedside throughout the procedure and into recovery,"" it said. The clinic's statement also appeared to address criticism that Rivers should have been treated in a hospital and not a clinic because of her advanced age. ""Yorkville Endoscopy has strict policies in place for the criteria of who gets treated in this center versus in a hospital,"" the statement said. ""Every patient is pre-screened by their gastroenterologist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse for appropriateness to be treated at Yorkville Endoscopy. Some patients are also pre-screened by their personal physicians."" The clinic is also well-equipped and staffed to handle emergencies, including for tracheal intubation when a patient stops breathing, the statement said. ""Yorkville Endoscopy has all necessary airway equipment, including a fiber optic scope available for emergency intubation,"" it said. ""Three to four board certified anesthesiologists are on duty at Yorkville Endoscopy at any given time."" All of its doctors are certified for advance cardiac life support and many of the nurses also work in hospital intensive care units and emergency rooms, it said. Rivers was a pointed, pioneering comedian . Rivers was undergoing an apparently minor elective procedure at the clinic when she suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest, according to the New York Fire Department. Paramedics took her by ambulance to Mount Sinai Hospital, about a mile from the clinic, where she was initially listed in critical condition.  Rivers spent a week on life support before she was pronounced dead on September 4. 25 of Joan Rivers' best jokes .

"Justin Bieber's lawyers are trying to persuade Los Angeles County prosecutors not to charge the singer with a felony in the alleged egg attack on a neighbor, sources close to the case told CNN Wednesday. The potential vandalism charge is what lawyers called a ""wobbler,"" meaning the district attorney must decide if it will be prosecuted as a felony -- which has much more serious consequences -- or as a misdemeanor. Several sources close to the investigation tell CNN there is little doubt Bieber will be charged with vandalism for the January incident and a decision should be announced soon. Bieber attorneys Howard Weitzman and Shawn Holley met with prosecutors Tuesday to argue that since the egging was ""a silly prank"" and Bieber has no criminal record, it should be treated as a misdemeanor, two sources said. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department detectives are pushing for a felony charge, based on the estimated $20,000 in damage caused by the eggs to the mansion next door. Justin's on the move . Bieber, 20, sold his Calabasas, California, mansion to Khloe Kardashian earlier this month and has already moved his skateboard ramp, video games and fast cars from the home where he's lived for the past two years, a source close to him confirmed. Despite tabloid speculation that Bieber planned to make Atlanta his new home, a source close to him told CNN that would not happen. He spent most of February in Atlanta, where he began his professional recording career, but in recent weeks he has flown to Florida, Texas and Canada. Bieber is now in Toronto, where he is working on new music, according to his Twitter postings. Hollywood's toughest role: Parent of a young celebrity . He is scheduled to be tried on a DUI charge in Miami on May 4. He also has an assault charge pending in Toronto, related to an alleged attack on his limo driver. None of the criminal charges facing Bieber, including the expected vandalism count, appear to threaten his freedom.  Probation sentences, fines, community service and counseling are routinely given in such cases. How Lindsay Lohan and Chris Brown could help Bieber . Bieber's Los Angeles lawyers are experienced in keeping their celebrity clients out of jail, although that can be a challenge if the client fails to comply with probation requirements. Attorney Shawn Holley also represents actress Lindsay Lohan, who became the poster child for probation violators after two drunken driving convictions. Lohan's career was derailed by supervised probation, which was interrupted several times by trips to jail and court-ordered rehab. Singer Chris Brown sits in a Los Angeles jail now because of repeated probation violations stemming from his 2009 assault conviction for the beating of then-girlfriend Rihanna.  Brown's prospects for resuming his music career anytime soon are dimmed by the requirement that he work on a highway cleanup crew three days a week for eight months after he is released from jail.","Prosecutors must decide if egging is prosecuted as a felony or a misdemeanor .

"The U.S. Justice Department has filed a notice of appeal over a federal judge's ruling that directed the Food and Drug Administration to make the morning-after birth control pill available to females of all ages without a prescription. In April, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman ordered the FDA to make emergency contraception, specifically the morning-after pill, available to females of any age without a prescription. This week's FDA announcement, which pertains to an application from Teva Women's Health Inc., is not related to Korman's order, the FDA said. The key ingredient in Plan B is the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel, which can prevent fertilization or, if an egg has been fertilized, prevent it from embedding in the uterus. Korman's ruling was in response to a lawsuit launched by the Center for Reproductive Rights. The group was seeking to expand access to all brands of the morning-after pill over the counter, such as Plan B One-Step and Next Choice, so that females of all ages would be able to purchase them without a prescription. Supporters of the ruling called it a landmark decision, while opponents raised concerns about safeguards being eliminated. On Wednesday, Planned Parenthood called on the Obama administration to allow access to the morning-after pill to be expanded. ""Studies show that emergency contraception is a safe and effective form of birth control that can prevent pregnancy if taken within five days of unprotected sex, and research also shows that teens are as likely as adults to use emergency contraception correctly,""  said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. ""Age barriers to emergency contraception are not supported by science, and they should be eliminated."" National Organization for Women President Terry O'Neill issued a statement saying the appeal of Korman's ruling is ""a step backwards for women's health."" ""Millions of women need access to this safe and effective product, and the prevention of unwanted pregnancy, particularly in adolescents, should not be obstructed by politicians,"" O'Neill said. Emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours. Many developed countries require a prescription for oral contraceptives, including Canada and most of Europe, but other countries sell the pill without a prescription even formally or informally.","The Justice Department says the judge's ruling does not have ''point-of-sale restrictions""

"(WIRED) -- Oh sure, Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner is made of composite materials and it's super fuel efficient, but unless you own an airline, the only thing you care about is how comfortable it is. Boeing knows this, and has striven to give passengers an experience unlike any other airplane. The aerospace company decided an all-new airplane needs an all-new interior and went all-out to make the 787's interior as innovative as its airframe, aerodynamics and engines. From the air you breath to the turbulence you (won't) feel to the windows you look through, the passenger experience promises to provide something new at every stage of your flight. ""When you go inside a 787 mockup, you get this 'wow!'"" said airline analyst Scott Hamilton, who got to see a demo interior at Boeing's facility near Seattle. You know the 787 is something different the moment you step inside. Boeing wastes no time giving passengers a new experience. As soon as you board the Dreamliner, you're greeted by an open area just inside the door. The ceiling resembles a skylight, complete with blue LED lighting that mimics the sky. ""They've designed this kind of lounge area instead of coming in next to a galley,"" Hamilton says. ""It really gives you a welcoming area instead of entering into somebody's kitchen."" Of course, it's up to the airlines buying the planes to decide what you see, and some of them may well modify the boarding area and other features of the plane. But even if they muck it up completely, there's still a lot of ""wow"" in the 787 cabin. The onboard lighting is one of the coolest features. Anyone who has flown across more than a couple of time zones knows how difficult it is to sleep, and to be awakened with the flick of a switch that floods the cabin in fluorescent white light. Boeing's LEDs allow the crew to adjust the lighting to match different phases of the flight. The light is fairly standard during boarding and while cruising. During meals it is adjusted to warmer tones. Once you're done eating and want to tilt the seat back and relax, the cabin can be bathed in a relaxing lavender hue. When it's time to sleep, the lights are turned way down. But it's how the crew wakes you that's the best part of the Dreamliner's lighting. Instead of flicking the lights on and flooding the cabin in light, the cabin will brighten slowly, with the light transitioning from the purples and oranges of a sunrise to yellows, and eventually white against a blue sky. Boeing's thought is mimicking the light schedule of your destination, some of the dreaded jet lag can be alleviated . Sleep time brings up another innovation. Gone is that dreaded moment when, after you finally fall asleep, that passenger in the window seat raises the shade to make sure the Pacific Ocean is still there and fills the cabin with sunlight. The windows of the 787 don't have shades. They use an electrochromic dimmable system. You can let in all the light you want -- or none at all -- at the flick of a switch. Of course, the crew has a master switch, so when it's time to sleep, that guy in the window seat can only get just enough light to confirm the Pacific hasn't gone anywhere without bothering everybody else. He'll have a better view, too. The 787's windows are 65 percent bigger than the windows in other planes. Boeing made them taller, so kids and NBA players can enjoy the same view as the average passenger. Boeing spent a lot of time focusing on how passengers perceive the cabin. Let's face it: you're sitting in a tube. It's only so big -- the fuselage is 18 feet 11 inches wide -- and there's only so much space you can use. Things are always a little more spacious in first class, but Boeing wanted to make sure even those of us crammed into coach feel like we have more room. To do that, Boeing's designers gave the 787 an open, airy design. It's another reason for the skylight-like lighting. ""The upper ceiling designs are arched in such a fashion that you get a much more open feeling than you do in a typical wide-body airplane,"" Hamilton says. Even the overhead bins have been redesigned. To accommodate the trend of more carry-on bags due to baggage fees and the unwillingness of some passengers to part with their luggage, Boeing made the bins about 30 percent bigger. They're easier to load because they lower when opened and tuck away when raised. That should be a big help for people who don't understand what a carry-on should be and make it easier for the rest of us to stash our stuff and get out of the aisle. The composite structure of the 787 means the Dreamliner is lighter and more aerodynamic, which is a boon for airlines. But the composite construction means the airframe isn't prone to corrosion like aluminum. That means the crew can increase the humidity of the cabin, reducing that parched feeling you have after a long flight. And thanks again to the composite fuselage, the interior cabin pressure can be increased. This means the cabin will be pressurized to an altitude of 6,000 feet instead of the typical 8,000 feet. These combined factors should make breathing much more comfortable and lead to fewer headaches, fatigue and other health issues common to many passengers. Another factor that often leads to headaches and general annoyance is noise, especially if you're sitting behind the engines. The new serrated engine nacelles on the 787 make the plane quieter -- both for passengers and those who live in the plane's flight path. Even the fan blades inside the engine are designed to be quieter. One of the more innovative passenger comfort systems on the 787 is the computer-controlled turbulence-reduction system. Boeing claims the Smoother Ride Technology will provide an eight-fold reduction in the number of people experiencing motion sickness. Sensors throughout the airplane detect subtle changes in air pressure indicative of turbulence and direct the fly-by-wire flight controls to move flaperons on the wings to counter the vertical motion. It won't eliminate all the bumps, but Boeing says it will work especially well on the moderate turbulence that causes most airsickness. All of this technology puts the 787 well ahead of the competition, Hamilton says. He points out that if you only know the standard airline interior, you won't feel like you're missing anything. But even the most modern of interiors in other airplanes doesn't compare. ""Airbus had done a complete makeover of the A320 interior in 2007,"" Hamilton says. ""But it's a conventional looking interior. It's very good, but having been inside the 787, you just get that 'wow' factor."" And the new interiors will make the airlines happy as well. From the windows to the bathrooms and everything in between, the 787 interior is designed to be easier to clean and cheaper to repair or replace. The Dreamliner is two years overdue and Boeing has lost orders because of those delays. But Hamilton and others say once the flight test is finished and the first loads of passengers have flown on the new airplane, most of the bad memories should be erased. He says there are likely to be a few more hiccups between now and then, but is confident both the airlines and the flying public will appreciate the new design. ""Boeing is going to have a real winner on its hands,"" he says. We'll find out in nine months. That's when Japan's All Nippon Airways starts service with the first passenger carrying 787.

"Shipping companies may have found a new tool to fight piracy: It turns out, pirates like to tweet. Not only that, Somali-based pirates blog and are on Facebook, security experts say. And it is through social media that shipping companies are increasing their understanding of how they operate. ""Somalia is a very sophisticated economy, it has one of the best mobile phone communication systems in the world,"" said Jessica Lincoln, director of intelligence at Rubicon Resolution, a risk consultancy. Lincoln follows pirates' activities using what she describes as ""normal"" web tools. She gathers whatever individuals and organizations like al-Qaeda's Somali affiliate Al-Shabaab post online about attacks. The insurgent organization runs a Twitter account  where it publicizes its activities. The Al-Shabaab Twitter account has been a part of the debate over whether terrorist organizations should be allowed to use Twitter. Twitter does not take responsibility for the accuracy and appropriateness of user content in its terms of service. Another source for her is the Kenyan army,  which Lincoln describes as fully engaged in online exchanges with Al-Shabaab. Fertile territory for Al-Shabaab in chaos of Somalia . Other organizations, like the International Maritime Organization, document pirate attacks and tweet about them. While, for example, Al-Shabaab may claim an attack was carried out, Lincoln will confirm this claim with other online sources, like the Kenyan army or the IMO. Lincoln has put together data from social media, mainstream media, academics, governmental organizations, and NGOs to create a virtual representation of the social networking web of pirates in Somalia. Her work -- aggregated from online sources -- has drawn the interest of shippers and government intelligence agencies. Her work was on display at a recent shipping conference in Hong Kong, where more than half the conference dealt with risks and crises in this field, suggesting the industry's growing concern with violence and piracy. But the same weakness Lincoln exploits can favor criminals. Shipping companies, like all listed enterprises, are required to disclose information like vessel sizes, their expenses in armed escorts and usual routes. Pirates are armed with increasingly sophisticated technology and ample online access to stay ahead of the game.  As a result, the high-seas clash between pirates and commercial shippers is becoming more of a technology race, security experts say. ""[Pirates] are being more understanding of the shipping industry, because of the World Wide Web and the money they've got through ransom payments, they bought themselves the laptops, they've got their iPhones and their iPads,"" said Lane Aldred, director of maritime and security services at Control Risks. Aldred said pirates look at shipping schedules and the protection measures aboard to select targets. In 2011, the total cost of piracy was $7 billion, according to a report by Oceans Beyond Piracy, an NGO. Aldred considers this estimate conservative. Meanwhile, the same report said that ransoms were 2% of these total costs. Re-routing ships is piracy's biggest cost, estimated at $2.4 billion a year, or about a third of the total. Other growing piracy costs for shippers are insurance premiums and security equipment. Nevertheless, OBP states that while successful attacks are decreasing due to improving counter measures, ransoms and the time a ship is held have increased. Longer kidnap times for seafarers implies a series of problems that pirates solve through specialization: while some attack ships on sea, others supply a number of services on land. ""It's like a supply chain... you have the attackers, they're the guys on the skiffs, approaching the vessel, boarding the vessel and getting the hostages; you got the guy who sets himself up as the negotiator; you got the guy that manages the vessel and the hostages,"" Aldred told CNN. ""There are different actors brought in for their specialist function."" As more people get involved in these operations, their impact reverberates throughout local communities. Somalia earn on average about $600 a year, according to the CIA, so a $1 million ransom payment can be a boon to local operators involved in an aspect of the pirate trade, analysts said. Many people in Somalia are aware of what's going on, and they talk about it on Twitter and other social media. Still, analysts face the same problems social media encounters elsewhere. ""Actually getting verified information from within Somalia is very difficult, because anybody can tweet, anybody can post anything,"" Lincoln said. Therefore, Twitter is only one source that undergoes a validation process before accepting these bits of information as usable, she said. Lincoln has three guidelines. ""First we look at corroboration of data,"" she said. The analyst tries to compare tweets to recognized sources reporting on piracy like the International Maritime Organization. If data can't be matched to a report by the IMO or other trusted organization, she seeks to understand who's behind it. ""If you can understand their agenda, you can understand where they're coming from judging that piece of information,"" she said. Militant groups use Twitter as propaganda, whereas others could be trying relay a fact, according to the analyst. And if these two steps fail, and the information is still valuable, Lincoln includes it in her analysis with a full disclosure of source and circumstance, she said.","Pirates are using Twitter, Facebook and other social media to do their business .

"A dispute between a Muslim gold shop owner and two Buddhist sellers erupted in clashes that left 10 people dead, 20 injured and four mosques burned to the ground in central Myanmar, local officials said Thursday. The clashes began Wednesday morning in Meiktila Township after a quarrel between the shop owner and the sellers, police said. The sellers were beaten up by four other Muslim shop owners, police said. In retaliation, Muslims and Buddhists took to the street, torching houses and schools, said Police Lt. Col. Aung Min. To defuse tensions, police imposed a curfew Wednesday night. Tension, police presence . The death toll from the violence has risen to 10, said Win Htein, a member of parliament for the area. He described the situation as still tense despite the increased police presence. Win Htein, a member of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's National League of Democracy, linked the unrest to feelings stirred up by clashes between Buddhists and Muslims in western Myanmar last year. When police took two Muslim shop owners to court Thursday, a group of several hundred Buddhists tried to attack them and threw rocks, he said. Myanmar is emerging from decades of military repression to democracy, but has been plagued by bouts of ethnic violence. In the western state of Rakhine, tensions between the majority Buddhist community and the Rohingya -- a stateless ethnic Muslim group -- boiled over into clashes that killed scores of people and left tens of thousands of others living in makeshift camps last year. Most of the victims were Rohingya. 'Grave concern' ""The ongoing intercommunal strife in Rakhine State is of grave concern,"" the International Crisis Group said in a November report. ""And there is the potential for similar violence elsewhere, as nationalism and ethno-nationalism rise and old prejudices resurface."" A failure by authorities to address deepening divisions between the communities could result in a resumption of violence in the future, the report said, ""which would be to the detriment of both communities, and of the country as a whole."" The U.S. ambassador to Myanmar, Derek Mitchell, said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the reports of violence in Meiktila this week. U.S. diplomats are monitoring events closely, he said in a post on the embassy's Facebook page. Win Htein, the local lawmaker, said that about 30% of the township's 100,000 residents are Muslim.","The death toll from the violence rises to 10, a local lawmaker says .

"With New Delhi's iconic Red Fort as a backdrop, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced Wednesday his country has set its sights on the Red Planet. In a Wednesday speech marking India's independence day, Singh said his government has approved plans to put an unmanned probe in orbit around Mars. The mission ""will be a huge step for us in the area of science and technology,"" he said. It's an ambitious goal, with a planned launch in November 2013 for a 10-month flight, said Kiran Karnik, a former official with the Indian Space Research Organization. ""By the time the mission gets there, Mars will be comparatively the closest,"" Karnik told CNN's sister network CNN-IBN. ""So there's a small window in which we need to make a launch and that's the reason the mission has to go up next year."" NASA's Mars rover set for test drive . The goal of the mission is to search for clues to the ""geology, origin, evolution and sustainability of life"" on Mars, according to an ISRO report published earlier this year. India's space program launched its first Earth satellite in 1975 and put an unmanned probe into orbit around the moon in 2008. It plans to launch its first manned spaceflight in 2016, though an Indian cosmonaut, Rakesh Sharma, flew aboard a Soviet space mission in 1984. Mars 'Mohawk Guy' inspires Obama . The announcement comes as the U.S. space agency NASA is basking in the successful landing of its Curiosity rover August 6. If the 2013 mission is successful, India would become the first Asian country to reach Mars: A 1998 attempt by Japan failed to insert itself into martian orbit, while a Chinese probe was lost along with the Russian Phobos-Grunt mission in January. But Karnik said India shouldn't be concerned with stunts. ""My only concern, if anything, is not the risk of failure,"" he said. ""It's the risk that the program should not get diverted to these high-visibility, somewhat prestige-related events.""

"More than 20,000 people have been displaced by fighting between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in western Myanmar that saw Islamic organizations canceling the religious holiday of Eid al-Adha, a U.N. official said Sunday. That estimate came from Ashok Nigam, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Myanmar. It follows clashes between the two sectarian groups that have left at least 64 people dead and thousands of homes torched in the western state of Rakhine. The fighting came as the All Myanmar Islam Association, a collaboration of five major Islamic organizations, canceled celebrations for Eid al-Adha, a four-day holiday observed by many Muslims. The group gave no explanation for the move, but locals are seeing it as a precautionary measure after the violence in recent days. There has been tension between the Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims since May, when violence began after three Muslim men were arrested on suspicion of raping and killing a Buddhist woman. New satellite imagery obtained by Human Rights Watch shows what it said was extensive destruction of buildings in a predominantly Rohingya area of the coastal town of Kyauk Pyu. The swath of arson, the group said, stretched over 35 acres and included houseboats and floating barges. The government in Myanmar ""urgently needs to provide security for the Rohingya ... who are under vicious attack,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. ""Unless the authorities also start addressing the root causes of the violence, it is only likely to get worse."" The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority who say they have been persecuted by the Myanmar military during its decades of authoritarian rule. Myanmar doesn't recognize them as citizens. Q&A: What's behind the sectarian violence in Myanmar? Unrest between the Rohingya and majority Buddhists has tested President Thein Sein's administration, which is trying to seek reconciliation with Myanmar's different ethnic groups and move the country toward more democratic governance. The government has sent extra security into the troubled region and declared a state of emergency. The president's office warned Thursday that ""manipulators"" behind the violence can expect to be found and prosecuted. Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, speaking in Parliament on Friday, called for a greater security presence and urged authorities to investigate suspected human rights offenses.","Clashes between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims have left 20,000-plus homeless, U.N. says .

"Whenever there is an uprising among the people of this country in the form of protests and organized dissent, especially with a presidential election 13 months away, the discussion inevitably shifts to what it will mean for one of the nation's two political parties. No matter how hard they've tried to suggest that they aren't partisan, the tea party is nothing more than a sub-group of the Republican Party. If there were a healthy number of tea party Democrats, then that would be true. But there isn't, so it's nonsensical to waste time not calling the tea party Republicans exactly what they are: tea party Republicans. From Day One the movement aligned itself with the GOP, and that is true today. Yet the attempt by Fox News, conservative radio show hosts and the GOP presidential candidates to associate Occupy Wall Street protesters with the image of far-left radical hippies being in lockstep with the Democratic Party is wrong, shameful and pure intellectual dishonesty. Being concerned about the nation's well-being, and the depths to which the big-monied interests are driving the nation's policies is not a partisan question; it is a moral one. GOP presidential candidate wants to cheapen the discussion by suggesting Occupy Wall Street protesters hate capitalism. I sense they despise a nation that has come to be one in which Fortune 500 companies and big banks run ads talking about how great America is, but work hard to destroy America by shipping jobs overseas and engaging in shameful business practices that require the taxpayer to bail them out. It's really simple, and insanely stupid, to examine the real anger of Occupy Wall Street as a bunch of young folks with nothing to do. If we recall March 2009 when the AIG bonuses came to light, every corner of this nation was angry with what we heard. Political ideology didn't matter. It was seen as a matter of right and wrong. That's why the various leaders of Occupy Wall Street, no matter how local and decentralized, must look at their effort as not being a galvanizing force to put one party into office. Instead, it should be about candidates of both political parties, as well as independents, speaking to their needs and desires. This tea party vs. Occupy Wall Street construct is a ridiculous one. From a media perspective, it's a cheap and easy narrative that, in the end, doesn't tell the full story. As someone who is more enamored with studying the intricacies of the civil rights movement rather than memorizing key speeches of its leaders, what was clear from Day One was that it wasn't about getting a Democrat or Republican elected. It was always about ensuring full freedom and equality for African-Americans who were denied their rights as citizens. At different points, Republicans and Democrats were allies of the civil rights movement, while at the same time some Republicans and Democrats were virulent opponents. It wasn't about party for civil rights leaders; it was about principle. And that is exactly where we sit today. As I listen to the Occupy Wall Street protesters and watch as their protest spread across the country, similar to the lunch counter sit-ins that spread like wildfire across the South in 1960, the goals and ideals sound eerily familiar. While in the 1960s it was about race, the civil rights battlefront today is about class. It is about the widening gap between the rich and poor, and how the middle class is being pushed down to the poor, rather than being helped upward. This struggle is the moral dilemma the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. frequently discussed. If folks would stop focusing on the last part of his ""I Have A Dream"" speech and read all of what he said at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on Aug. 28, 1963, they would understand that. So what if Russell Simmons, Kayne West and other celebrities have millions and are showing support for Occupy Wall Street? When Harry Belafonte, Dick Gregory, Sidney Poitier, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Peter, Paul and Mary, Charlton Heston, Mahalia Jackson and other celebrities attended the 1963 March, no one said how dare those individuals with big bank accounts stood in solidarity with those with no bank accounts. When it comes to fairness, your values matter more than your tax bracket. If labor unions and politicians want to stand in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street, that is a good thing. If individuals who work on or used to work on Wall Street want to show their support for the need to systemic changes to this system, more power to them. If self-identified Democrats and Republicans want to show their moral outrage, praise God. Moral movements aren't supposed to be poisoned by politics. When they do, that's when their legitimacy is lost. If politicians want to use their voices in support, they should. But at no time should Occupy Wall Street be about getting one party elected to local, county, state and national office. The time has come for men and women of conscience in this nation to stand up. It's vital that we elected individuals, regardless of party, who choose not to be an incestuous relationship with the rich in this country who are only about fattening their bottom lines while ignoring the plight of others. As Dr. King said: ""An individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.""","Roland Martin: Saying protesters are in lockstep with Democrats is intellectual dishonesty .
Candidates of both political parties should peaking to their desires, Martin says .

"(CNN) -- As the streets of New York and other cities filled with people protesting the non-indictment in the choking death of Eric Garner, defenders of the police generally fixated on Garner's health. Because Garner was obese, diabetic, asthmatic, suffered from sleep apnea, and had a heart condition, goes the argument, he was somehow to blame for his own death. Representative Peter King, R-New York, for example, went on CNN to thank the grand jury for not indicting Officer Daniel Panteleo. ""You had a 350-pound person who was resisting arrest. The police were trying to bring him down as quickly as possible,"" King said. ""If he had not had asthma and a heart condition and was so obese, almost definitely he would not have died."" King's comments have been echoed elsewhere, including by many law enforcement commentators on the site, PoliceOne.com. Their comments repeatedly invoke Garner's health, saying things such as, ""This guy would have died going up a flight of stairs,"" ""He died because of his preexisting medical conditions,"" and ""His family should sue Papa Johns, Dominos, Pizza Hut, Burger King, McDonalds."" What we are seeing in the death of Eric Garner and the reaction to the initial exoneration of his killer, is the intersection of racism, fat-hatred (as discussed by Melissa McEwan), and the failure of law enforcement to accommodate disability. Garner's case is not the first to suffer from these deadly intersections -- the language we've heard echoes numerous other cases in which police and their defenders blame disability for the results of police violence. Sadly, it also won't be the last, unless we stop letting people use one type of discrimination to defend against another. When Ethan Saylor, a man with Down syndrome, was allegedly killed by asphyxiation by ""off-duty deputies moonlighting as security guards,"" Saylor's disability and weight ended up being blamed. Their sheriff reportedly said that Saylor died because of a ""medical emergency."" The coroner likewise blamed Down syndrome and size for the death, and the grand jury didn't indict. As with Garner, there is some truth to the focus on health, but none of that would have mattered if law enforcement hadn't applied pressure to the throat. It's not just physical disability. It seems that every time a person with schizophrenia or other psychiatric disabilities gets hurt by law enforcement, the officers justify their actions by explaining that the individual acted in unpredictable ways, was potentially threatening, and so force had to be applied. We saw this after the death of Kajieme Powell in St. Louis last August. More recently, Tanesha Anderson died after allegedly being taken down to the ground by an officer. In Bessemer, Alabama, Donald Wilson was shot (but survived). Wilson and Powell both had small knives, were alleged to have known to be in mental-health crisis, and were shot after they reacted to officers entering close proximity. In all these cases, patience would likely have saved lives. According to the American with Disabilities Act (ADA), we must all provide ""reasonable accommodations"" to people with disabilities. I have argued before on CNN that this principle must be applied by the police even when they want to take people with disabilities into custody. In fact, this argument is the core question of Sheehan vs San Francisco, a case that the Supreme Court just agreed to hear. Sheehan, a woman with psychiatric disabilities, was shot by police in 2008. She's sued under the ADA, claiming that her disability was not reasonably accommodated when police charged into her room without backup, got close to her, and then shot her when she didn't immediately comply. How the high court rules on the case will shape law enforcement reactions to disability for the foreseeable future. I argue that far from exonerating Panteleo, the focus on Garner's health merely tries to conceal structural racism under the cloak of ableism. It is not ""reasonable"" to place an unarmed man like Garner in a chokehold. He was not a threat, he was known to be suffering from health issues, and he was obviously obese. Yes, without those health issues Garner might well have survived, but their presence excuses nothing. Rather, they reveal the ways in which one form of discrimination intensifies when linked to another. When something like Garner's death happens, we have to be willing to approach it as an intersection of multiple factors. Ableism doesn't excuse racism. Racism doesn't excuse fat-hatred. Fat-hatred doesn't excuse the class-based discrimination. Rather, they sweep together, enabling us to see patterns of prejudice and their horrific outcomes. And when we can see the whole, then we can concentrate on solutions that address them all, such as demanding reasonable accommodations, reforming police procedure, and reinforcing basic civil rights for all Americans.","David Perry: Defenders of police in Garner case have focused on health .

"(WIRED) -- From the earliest days of aviation, pilots have relied upon paper maps to help find their way. Even in an era of GPS and advanced avionics, you still see pilots lugging around 20 pounds or more of charts. But those days are numbered, because maps are giving way to iPads. The Federal Aviation Administration is allowing charter company Executive Jet Management to use Apple's tablet as an approved alternative to paper charts. The authorization follows three months of rigorous testing and evaluation of the iPad and Mobile TC, a map app developed by aviation chartmaker Jeppesen. The latest decision applies only to Executive Jet Management, but it has implications for all of aviation. By allowing the company's pilots to use the Apple iPad as a primary source of information, the FAA is acknowledging the potential for consumer tablets to become avionics instruments. The iPad has been popular with pilots of all types since its introduction last year. But until now, it could not be used in place of traditional paper charts or FAA-approved devices such as more expensive, purpose-built electronic flight bags. The iPad was OK for reference, but not as a pilot's sole source of information. The new FAA authorization changes all that. To receive FAA authorization, Jeppesen and Executive Jet Management went through a rigorous approval process. It included rapid-decompression testing from a simulated altitude of 51,000 feet and ensuring the tablet will not interfere with critical navigation or electronic equipment. Executive Jet tested the iPad and Mobile TC in 10 aircraft flown by 55 pilots during 250 flights. The first thought many pilots, not to mention passengers, may have is: What happens if the iPad or the app crashes? Jeff Buhl, Jeppesen's product manager for the Mobile TC app, says the Apple iOS operating system and the app proved ""extremely stable"" during testing. In the ""unlikely"" event of a software crash, he says, it takes but a moment to get them running again. ""The recovery time for an application crashing or the OS crashing is extremely rapid,"" Buhl says. During the evaluation period with the FAA, the production app did not crash. But even if it did, Buhl says it's ready to go again ""in 4-6 seconds from re-launch to previous state."" The FAA says each individual operator -- in this case Executive Jet Management -- must develop specific procedures for dealing with system or software crashes and other issues. Under the authorization, Executive Jet Management will require a second approved electronic device, which most likely will be another iPad, in the cockpit. Pilots may get magic fingers to keep them alert . Although this authorization applies to just one company, it is a milestone for all operators, including major airlines, because it opens the door for them to embrace the iPad. Though any company wishing to follow Executive Jet's lead will have to endure equally rigorous scrutiny by the FAA. Agency spokesman Les Dorr says the process is no different from what is required for any other electronic device used to display navigation information. ""As far as the iPad is concerned, we do that on a case-by-case basis when an airline applies to be able to use it,"" Dorr says. The FAA is already seeing more requests to use the iPad in the cockpit. Alaska Airlines began testing the iPad back in November and there are about 100 pilots currently evaluating the device according to spokeswoman Marianne Lindsey. She says in addition to the convenience, there is a practical weight-saving aspect to using the iPad as well, ""it's replaced about 25 pounds of manuals and charts."" Jeppesen's director of portfolio management, Tim Huegel, says several carriers are looking into using the iPad and TC Mobile, and with the FAA granting one approval, it should become increasingly easy for others to follow Executive Jet's lead. ""We'll be able to reuse a lot of the documentation and the lessons learned working with Executive Jet Management to help our commercial customers as they now begin to pursue FAA authorization,"" he says. The charts available with Mobile TC include charts for visual flight rules and for instrument flight rules, which are more commonly used by commercial operators. The app only shows an electronic version of the paper charts Jeppesen has been producing for years, but Huegel says future versions could incorporate the iPad's GPS capability. He sees a day when tablets provide ""door-to-door management"" of a pilot's information, from crew scheduling to weather information to navigation charts.

"Google already is a major player in search, online mapping, social networking and other key functions of the Web. Now it wants to sell domain names, too. The Internet giant on Monday announced the launch of an invite-only service, Google Domains, to help small businesses find, register and manage their Web addresses. The service is currently in beta testing with a small number of users. ""Businesses will be able to search, find, purchase and transfer the best domain for their business -- whether it's .com, .biz, .org, or any of the wide range of new domains that are being released to the Web,"" Google said in a blog post about the venture. With this move, Google will be directly competing with companies they once partnered with. Their most notable partner-turned-rival will be GoDaddy, the world's largest domain-management company, which has faced financial troubles in recent years. GoDaddy has 57 million domains registered to its service, but the company hasn't generated a profit since 2009 and in the last two years has reported combined losses of $480 million. Earlier this month, the company filed for a $100 million IPO. The new Google service will allow users to purchase new domain names as well as transfer existing ones. It also offers some perks that other companies don't, such as free private registration, which keeps the site owner's personal information hidden from the public. Google isn't quoting prices yet, although a window on the Google Domains site suggests that registering a domain will cost $12 a year. Google hasn't announced when Domains will be available to the public, although it's encouraging potential customers to request invite codes to test the service. Google said the beta-testing process will investigate ways to streamline Domains for users, improve customer service and determine which extra services, such as mobile-site design, will be offered. The service will allow Google to take advantage of 1,400 newly created top-level domain endings, such as the already popular .guru.  Google is already on the International Corporation for Assigned Names and Number's list of accredited registrars for well-known domains like .com, .net, and .org. Domain-name registration has increased steadily over the years.  According to the website nTLD Stats, 1.3 million new names have been registered already this year.  Verisign, a domain research group, reported an increase of 7% from the end of 2012 to end of 2013. Google is late to the domain-name market. But as a dominant Internet player, it may be able to leverage this new service in ways smaller rivals cannot. ""The company has a vested interest in getting as many businesses online as possible. It gets them hooked into its many products including Google Apps, Gmail, Google Pages, etc.,"" wrote Andrew Allemann for Domain Name Wire, an industry blog. Google then could sell them ads, he noted.

"""We have broken through the partisanship and the gridlock,"" Sen. Patty Murray, one of two chief budget negotiators, said of Tuesday's deal to avoid another government shutdown. Murray, a Democrat from Washington state serving her fourth term, is considered a steady hand in the Senate who shuns grandstanding and garners respect from both sides of the aisle. She is a liberal, but can be pragmatic and has some conservative thoughts on budget issues. As Senate Budget Committee chairman, she is concerned about the deficit, and the deal she struck with her more flashy House Republican counterpart, Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan, on Tuesday makes up some ground for the failure of bipartisan talks she helped lead two years ago to reach a grander fiscal bargain. She said the new agreement was one she would not have put forth alone. It was a compromise, she said at a news conference. ""We need to acknowledge that our nation has serious long-term fiscal challenges"" that the proposal ""does not address,"" Murray said. Murray and Ryan have spent the last two months working on an agreement that would set government spending levels and replace the next round of deep automatic cuts to avoid another government shutdown, known as the sequester. Murray assumed the Democratic chairmanship of the budget committee this year, replacing retiring Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota. She won re-election in 2010 by a slim margin, defeating Republican Dino Rossi, 52% to 48%. First elected in 1992 after serving four years in the Washington State Senate, Murray has become a powerful player in the upper chamber as chairwoman of the budget committee -- leading her party's voice in fiscal talks -- as well as helping Democrats maintain the Senate majority in her role as chairwoman of the campaign committee. Murray's father, who was awarded a Purple Heart in World War II, suffered from multiple sclerosis and was disabled. Her family was on food stamps for a time. She points out on her website how the federal government helped her and her brothers and sisters; her mother went back to school under a government program to find a better paying job. She and her siblings attended college on federal grants and student loans. Like her negotiating partner, Murray loves the outdoors and fishing, something she alluded to as they announced the deal and their ability to find a compromise. ""We do have some major differences,"" she said. ""We cheer for a different football team, clearly. We catch different fish. We have some differences on policy, but we agree our country needs some certainty.""","Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Paul Ryan are key players in budget deal .

"A member of the Sugarhill Gang, whose pioneering hit ""Rapper's Delight"" brought hip hop to mainstream audiences 35 years ago, died Tuesday of complications from cancer. ""Big Bank Hank,"" whose real name was Henry Jackson, died early Tuesday in Englewood, New Jersey, according to David Mallie, who manages the two surviving Sugarhill Gang members. The New York native was 57. A beefy, boisterous presence onstage, Hank handled vocals in the early to middle portion of ""Rapper's Delight,"" which despite its extended length -- one version was more than 14 minutes long -- became the first rap song to reach the Top 40 on the U.S. Billboard charts. Jackson traded rhymes with bandmates ""Wonder Mike"" Wright and Guy ""Master Gee"" O'Brien and spoke some of the song's catchiest lines, including ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn/If your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend."" Wonder Mike and Master Gee issued a statement Tuesday: . ""So sad to hear about our brother's passing.  The 3 of us created musical history together with the release of Rapper's Delight.  We will always remember traveling the world together and rocking the house.  Rest in peace Big Bank."" The three friends were unknown MCs when producer Sylvia Robinson recruited them to record the song for her rap label, Sugar Hill Records. Released in fall 1979, ""Rapper's Delight"" became a novelty hit and a staple at dance clubs well into 1980. It was born from the emerging New York hip-hop scene of the late '70s, in which young rappers gathered in clubs and exchanged rhymes over instrumental breaks from popular songs, most notably Chic's hit ""Good Times."" ""Rapper's Delight"" also borrowed its bass line and other flourishes from ""Good Times,"" prompting threats of legal action by Chic co-founders Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards. After a settlement, Rodgers and Edwards were listed as co-writers of the song. ""It felt like a new art form,"" Rodgers said later of ""Rapper's Delight.""

"The events in Ferguson, Missouri, are a ""tragedy,"" but the U.N. Committee Against Torture ""has to respect the decision"" of authorities not to prosecute police Officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, committee member Alessio Bruni said Friday. Bruni spoke at a news conference about the release of a committee report that criticizes, among other things, racial profiling and excessive use of force by U.S. police. While the  report does not specifically mention the Ferguson case, it does express concern about the militarization of U.S. police departments. The U.S. was one of eight countries getting a periodic review of compliance with the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The other countries getting reports from the committee Friday were Sweden, Ukraine, Venezuela, Australia, Burundi, Croatia and Kazakhstan. Much of the 16-page report that focuses on the U.S. deals with Guantanamo Bay and the treatment of detainees there, but it also includes a section on police brutality and criticizes ""excessive use of force by law enforcement officials, in particular against persons belonging to certain racial and ethnic groups."" The report's release comes about two weeks after Brown's parents spoke to the committee in Geneva, Switzerland, in testimony behind closed doors. Though the talk was private, the delegation that organized their trip said the couple told the committee that Brown's killing, and force used by police officers during protests that followed, ""represent violations of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment."" The U.N. report mentions ""deep concern at the frequent and recurrent police shootings or fatal pursuits of unarmed black individuals."" Instances of police brutality should be investigated  by entities that have ""no institutional or hierarchical connection between the investigators and the alleged perpetrators,"" the report recommends. The U.N committee also expressed  concern about juveniles in the criminal justice system, the use of the death penalty and sexual violence in the U.S. military.","The U.S. is one of eight countries reported on by the U.N.

"In 2001 a huge earthquake shook the state of Gujarat in India. 2,000 people were killed, 400,000 lost their homes, and countless more lost their businesses in the devastation. One young entrepreneur, Mansukhbhai Prajapati, lost everything, but found an innovative way to get back on his feet. Prajapati designed a low-cost clay fridge which required no electricity and continued to function in the event of major catastrophes or blackouts such as the one that devastated his village. Prajapati's invention is part of a growing trend in India that has become known as ""frugal innovation"" -- below-the-radar inventors across the country devising low-cost solutions to local problems, often borne of necessity, using bespoke technologies of their own creation. So striking has the trend for frugal innovation become, that last year the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (Nesta), an independent charity in the UK, commissioned and published a major research paper on the phenomenon. The paper said ""frugal innovation is found throughout the Indian system: from ... efforts to crowdsource drug discovery driven by government labs, to Bharti Airtel's approach to cutting the cost of mobile phone calls, to the Keralan approach to palliative care which is providing access to support at the end of life for thousands in a void of formal healthcare."" At the forefront of the frugal innovation movement is Professor Anil Gupta who, for the last 20 years, has been travelling across India in search of local inventors whose creativity has had a positive impact on rural poverty. In 1989, Gupta founded the Honey Bee Network, an organization that uncovers grassroots inventors, and helps bring their inventions to the world. ""I have walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years,"" says Gupta. ""I have tried to map the minds of people who are creating around the country."" Gupta's journey has brought him into contact with inventors who are solving common problems in frugal ways, using traditional knowledge and readily available materials. By his own reckoning, Gupta believes that the Honey Bee Network has helped unearth over 25,000 new inventions, including a motorbike-mounted crop sprayer, a device for climbing trees, an amphibious bicycle and a wind-powered irrigation system. Kirsten Bound, the author of Nesta's report, says ""frugal innovation is all about creating advantage out of constraint. Faced with scarce resources and institutional voids, frugal innovators develop radical new solutions to problems. It's not just about making things cheaper, but better, more appropriate and scalable. It involves leveraging available resources in new ways, reducing or re-using waste or even re-thinking an entire system around a product or service."" Mansukhbhai Patel, a Gujerati farmer devised just such a product. Picking cotton in Gujarat is a manual task which, in the past, has frequently been undertaken by children. In a bid to reduce the work involved, Patel invented a cotton-stripping machine that can be operated by one person. Professor Gupta believes the invention has helped significantly reduce child labor in the region. Frugal Digital, a research group run by the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design, seeks to promote exactly this kind of invention. The group runs projects in conjunction with Indian inventors to build cheap, ""hackable"" devices to solve enduring problems across the subcontinent. Priya Mani, project manager for Frugal Digital, says that there is a lot to learn from ""thinking about how you can hack everyday castaway objects."" The projects the organization has run in conjunction with Indian inventors have already yielded products that are being used around India today, including a classroom projector fashioned from repurposed cell phone components and a low-cost health screening tool made from an old alarm clock. But Mani believes that work being done by frugal innovators  in India has yet to have a significant international impact: ""People thought we were totally nuts trying to create something new out of old parts."" Bound believes that the philosophy of frugal innovation and the practice of repurposing technology  could be applied globally. ""Frugal innovation coming out of India could have important implications for the rest of the world"" says Bound. ""General Electric has shown with its now famous ultra-low cost ECG machine that there is a Western market for products born out of the constraints of the Indian healthcare market. It forces multinationals to think about how their existing investment intensive models of innovation can face inevitable growing competition with Indian and Chinese multinationals."" Of course, not all stories of frugal innovation have a happy ending. In 1975, flooding across India brought the province of Bihar to a standstill. The rising waters in the village of Jatwa-Janerwa made it impossible for many people to work, shop or go about their daily lives. Local honey salesman, Mohammed Saidullah, was forced to cross the swollen Ganges river for sell honey, but every trip came at a price -- the boat was expensive and paying the levy was driving him towards penury -- so he came up with novel solution. Saidullah locked himself away for three days of solid design and construction. When he emerged he had constructed an amphibious bicycle, which would allow him to contend with the annual monsoon. It looked like a regular bike, but had large retractable floats attached to the sides of each wheel. Saidullah's invention earned him a raft of awards including the National Innovation Foundation's lifetime achievement award. Yet in spite of the recognition, the inventor still lives in poverty. Gupta says there is work to be done yet in connecting creative people with funding, and not all of it can come from the public purse. According to Gupta, connecting grassroots technologists with big business will be key to development not just in India, but around the world. ""Nothing,"" he says, ""can justify preventing people from learning from one another.""","Indian inventors recycle old technology to solve local problems .

"Justin Bieber's neighbor accused the singer of spitting on him and making threats during a heated confrontation outside his California home Tuesday, a sheriff's spokesman said. Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies are investigating the neighbor's battery complaint against Bieber, spokesman Steve Whitmore said. Bieber's representative denied to deputies that the singer spat on or threatened the neighbor, Whitmore said. A member of the singer's security personnel toldCNN there was no physical contact. ""The neighbor went onto Justin's property. They exchanged words. The neighbor has had issues before,"" the source said. Investigators are also looking into the neighbor's complaint that Bieber drove his sports car at high speeds through the otherwise quiet streets of his gated Calabasas, California, community, Whitmore said. Bieber had just returned to his California home Tuesday morning after performing in Europe. Bieber, 19, moved into a $6.5 million mansion in The Oaks of Calabasas a year ago. The exclusive community is also home to Michael Jackson's mother and his three children. The teen pop star went through similar brush with the law last May when a photographer filed a complaint with the sheriff accusing Bieber of misdemeanor battery. That incident involved an alleged scuffle in the parking lot of a Calabasas shopping center.  The photographer said Bieber attacked him as he was taking photos of Bieber and his then-girlfriend, Selena Gomez.  Prosecutors declined to pursue the charge against Bieber in the case.","Los Angeles County deputies investigate neighbor's battery complaint against Bieber .

"Americans are steadfastly opposed to sending U.S. ground troops to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria, but an overwhelming number of people continue to support the U.S.-led airstrikes against the terrorist group, a new CNN/ORC International poll shows. While fewer than four in 10 Americans favor sending U.S. ground troops into a combat situation against ISIS, there is a widespread belief that such an action is inevitable, according to the poll. Only 24% of Americans do not think the United States will send combat troops to battle ISIS, while 36% say it is likely and another 39% say it is somewhat likely. Count House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, as one of those people. Boehner said Sunday it may take U.S. boots on the ground to defeat ISIS, as he questioned President Barack Obama's plan -- which includes airstrikes, training and equipping the Iraqi Army and moderate Syrian rebels -- to defeat the terrorist network. ""Listen, the President doesn't want to do that,"" Boehner said in an interview on ABC's ""This Week."" ""If I were the President, I probably wouldn't have talked about what I wouldn't do. And maybe, maybe we can get enough of these forces trained and get them on the battlefield, but somebody's boots have to be there."" Boehner later added that the United States might have ""no choice"" but to put U.S. soldiers on the ground. ""These are barbarians,"" Boehner said of ISIS in the ABC interview. ""They intend to kill us, and if we don't destroy them first, we're going to pay the price."" But Obama, in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS, continued to emphasize that U.S. combat troops will not be put on the ground, saying that the situation in the region is not a military problem, rather a political problem that leaders of those countries -- specifically Iraq -- need to address. ""This is not America against ISIL,"" Obama said in the interview that aired on '60 Minutes.'"" This is America leading the international community to assist a country with whom we have a security partnership with, to make sure that they -- are able to take care of their business."" Even though Obama has said he will not place combat troops in the region, the United States does have military advisers on the ground training and helping the Iraqi army strategically as it battle ISIS. ISIS fighter says U.S. airstrikes aren't effective . The formation of the international coalition of countries working with the United States to destroy ISIS is what appears to be giving Obama a boost of support from the American public for military action against ISIS. Seventy-three percent of Americans back the joint U.S. and ally airstrikes, but support drops to 50% if the mission had been undertaken solely by the United States. Americans have a weary eye about one piece of the plan to defeat ISIS: arming the moderate Syrian rebels. While Congress approved legislation before it left for the campaign trail to allow for the arming and training of the rebels, only 42% of Americans favor this action, and 54% oppose it. Still, there is an undeniable belief among Americans that ISIS poses some level of threat to the United States, with 45% describing it as ""very serious,"" 23% saying it is ""fairly serious"" and 23% noting that it is ""somewhat serious."" Since the President addressed the nation on September 10 to outline his plan to defeat ISIS, Americans appear more confident in his ability to address the situation. A CNN/ORC poll conducted before his speech showed that 37% of Americans approved of how he was handling ISIS, but this number has now increased to 45%. Overall, 46% of Americans approve of how he is handling the general topic of terrorism, up five points from the CNN/ORC poll conducted earlier this month. Overall, the President's approval rating remains constant from the previous CNN/ORC poll. Earlier this month, 43% of Americans approved of how he was handling his job, while the new CNN/ORC poll shows that it ticked up one point to 44%. Keating Holland, CNN's polling director, notes that only 40% of Americans believe the United States is at war with ISIS, which ""may explain why ... his job rating doesn't reflect a 'rally effect' that previous presidents have experienced during wartime."" In terms of the general mood of the country, 50% of Americans say things are going well, while 49% say it is going badly. On the five major general themes, Obama rates under 50%: terrorism, 46%; ISIS, 45%; foreign affairs, 42%; economy, 42%; health care 42% -- more signs that Obama could be more hurtful than helpful to vulnerable Democrats seeking reelection in November. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International, which interviewed 1,055 adult Americans, by telephone between September 25 and September 28. The sampling error is +/-3 percentage points.","Fewer than four in 10 Americans favor sending U.S. ground troops in fight ISIS .

"Like the spokesmen for Arab dictators feigning bewilderment over protesters' demands, mainstream television news reporters finally training their attention on the growing Occupy Wall Street protest movement seem determined to cast it as the random, silly blather of an ungrateful and lazy generation of weirdos. They couldn't be more wrong and, as time will tell, may eventually be forced to accept the inevitability of their own obsolescence. Consider how CNN anchor Erin Burnett, covered the goings on at Zuccotti Park downtown, where the protesters are encamped, in a segment called ""Seriously?!"" ""What are they protesting?"" she asked, ""nobody seems to know.""  Like Jay Leno testing random mall patrons on American History, the main objective seemed to be to prove that the protesters didn't, for example, know that the U.S. government has been reimbursed for the bank bailouts. It was condescending and reductionist. More predictably perhaps, a Fox News reporter appears flummoxed in this outtake from ""On the Record,"" in which the respondent refuses to explain how he wants the protests to ""end."" Transcending the shallow partisan politics of the moment, the protester explains ""As far as seeing it end, I wouldn't like to see it end. I would like to see the conversation continue."" To be fair, the reason why some mainstream news journalists and many of the audiences they serve see the Occupy Wall Street protests as incoherent is because the press and the public are themselves. It is difficult to comprehend a 21st century movement from the perspective of the 20th century politics, media, and economics in which we are still steeped. In fact, we are witnessing America's first true Internet-era movement, which -- unlike civil rights protests, labor marches, or even the Obama campaign -- does not take its cue from a charismatic leader, express itself in bumper-sticker-length goals and understand itself as having a particular endpoint. Yes, there are a wide array of complaints, demands, and goals from the Wall Street protesters: the collapsing environment, labor standards, housing policy, government corruption, World Bank lending practices, unemployment, increasing wealth disparity and so on. Different people have been affected by different aspects of the same system -- and they believe they are symptoms of the same core problem. Are they ready to articulate exactly what that problem is and how to address it? No, not yet. But neither are Congress or the president who, in thrall to corporate America and Wall Street, respectively, have consistently failed to engage in anything resembling a conversation as cogent as the many I witnessed as I strolled by Occupy Wall Street's many teach-ins this morning. There were young people teaching one another about, among other things, how the economy works, about the disconnection of investment banking from the economy of goods and services, the history of centralized interest-bearing currency, the creation and growth of the derivatives industry, and about the Obama administration deciding to settle with, rather than investigate and prosecute the investment banking industry for housing fraud. Anyone who says he has no idea what these folks are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for most of the rest of us are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns. That's because, unlike a political campaign designed to get some person in office and then close up shop (as in the election of Obama), this is not a movement with a traditional narrative arc. As the product of the decentralized networked-era culture, it is less about victory than sustainability. It is not about one-pointedness, but inclusion and groping toward consensus. It is not like a book; it is like the Internet. Occupy Wall Street is meant more as a way of life that spreads through contagion, creates as many questions as it answers, aims to force a reconsideration of the way the nation does business and offers hope to those of us who previously felt alone in our belief that the current economic system is broken. But unlike a traditional protest, which identifies the enemy and fights for a particular solution, Occupy Wall Street just sits there talking with itself, debating its own worth, recognizing its internal inconsistencies and then continuing on as if this were some sort of new normal. It models a new collectivism, picking up on the sustainable protest village of the movement's Egyptian counterparts, with food, first aid, and a library. Yes, as so many journalists seem obligated to point out, kids are criticizing corporate America while tweeting through their iPhones. The simplistic critique is that if someone is upset about corporate excess, he is supposed to abandon all connection with any corporate product.  Of course, the more nuanced approach to such tradeoffs would be to seek balance rather than ultimatums. Yes, there are things big corporations might do very well, like making iPhones. There are other things big corporations may not do so well, like structure mortgage derivatives. Might we be able to use corporations for what works, and get them out of doing what doesn't? And yes, some kids are showing up at Occupy Wall Street because it's fun. They come for the people, the excitement, the camaraderie and the sense of purpose they might not be able to find elsewhere. But does this mean that something about Occupy Wall Street is lacking, or that it is providing something that jobs and schools are not (thanks in part to rising unemployment and skyrocketing tuitions)? The members of Occupy Wall Street may be as unwieldy, paradoxical, and inconsistent as those of us living in the real world. But that is precisely why their new approach to protest is more applicable, sustainable and actionable than what passes for politics today. They are suggesting that the fiscal operating system on which we are attempting to run our economy is no longer appropriate to the task. They mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance America produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture. And in the process, they are pointing the way toward something entirely different than the zero-sum game of artificial scarcity favoring top-down investors and media makers alike.","Douglas Rushkoff says traditional media condescends to Occupy Wall Street movement .

"(CNN)What is it about winning streaks and racing drivers called Seb? First there was France's Sébastien Loeb with nine consecutive World Rally Championship titles between 2004 and 2012. Then came Germany's Sebastian Vettel who dominated Formula One for four straight seasons ending in 2013. Today, it's the turn of another Frenchman, Sébastien Ogier to leave the opposition trailing in his wake. The 31-year-old Volkswagen driver has dominated rallying over the past two seasons winning back-to-back world titles alongside co-driver and compatriot Julien Ingrassia. Ogier may have an unimpeded view at the front of the field now, but the road ahead hasn't always been so clear. ""Of course it was not a straight or easy way to the top,"" Ogier told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""It's never like that in any sport for any professional or any champion, I guess. I had to fight hard to (overcome) some difficult times but I have to say that the progression was very quick."" Hurtling through narrow forest roads, up and down mountain passes and skidding around dirt tracks at speeds routinely approaching 200 kph (125 mph) is where he's happiest. But like his compatriot Loeb, Ogier was a late bloomer in the sport, only starting his career at the age of 22. ""I really love rally because of the diversity of the sport. We are racing all over the world on lots of different surfaces -- we are driving on gravel, on tarmac, on snow. We always have to adapt and face very different situations. ""You need to have a lot of skills of adaptation because we are always facing the unknown -- we are never quite sure what's going to happen around the next corner."" Born in Gap, a small village in the foothills of the French Alps, Ogier developed a love of rallying at an early age watching competitors in the Monte Carlo Rally speed up and down the mountains near his home every January. ""My childhood dream was to become a racing driver for sure, but it was really looking like an unreachable dream for me (because) I was coming from a very modest area. ""My parents did their best ... but motorsport was obviously impossible to (break into) because it was too expensive,"" he says. His father gave him a rally kart when he was eight years old, but with no family money or sponsorship to fuel his ambitions further, Ogier got on with other things training to become a car mechanic, qualifying as ski instructor and gaining a reputation as a handy boules player too. There were forays into racing arenas, but only as a volunteer fire marshal at the Monaco Grand Prix -- a cheaper way to get a ringside seat, he says. His life would change though in 2005 when he won the Rallye Jeunes, an annual talent-spotting contest run by the French Motorsport Federation (FFSA). With the FFSA's financial backing, Ogier grabbed the opportunity with both hands, winning the Peugeot 206 Cup (a competition for aspiring rally drivers) in 2007 -- the first of many triumphs alongside co-driver Ingrassia. The pair won the Junior World Rally Championship the following year before stepping up to the World Rally Championship (WRC) proper in 2009, joining Citroen -- the home of Loeb, who had just won his fifth straight world title for the French team. Unfazed, Ogier was soon nipping at the heels of his illustrious teammate and a first podium finish in the second race of 2010 (in Mexico) was followed by a maiden WRC win in Portugal later that year. ""It was for sure a great moment. I always mention every step which brought me to the top, where it was very important to my career (but) obviously the first victory is a special moment that you remember forever."" Ogier secured third place overall in 2011, but the season was soured by a clash of egos with Loeb and the pair's increasingly fractious relationship came to a head in a row over team orders at the Acropolis Rally in Greece. The spat ultimately saw Ogier jump ship to Volkswagen helping the German manufacturer develop its Polo R WRC car during 2012 before returning to racing with a bang in 2013. He won nine of the 13 races, clinching his maiden world title on home soil in Strasbourg before winning a further eight races on his way to world title number two in 2014. Victory in last year's WRC was particularly satisfying after a horrific high-speed crash in Germany had threatened to derail the defense of his crown. He and Ingrassia walked away unscathed after plowing through a safety barrier -- Ogier later blamed himself for the error citing a lack of focus brought about by concerns over proposed rule changes to the sport. ""That big crash I took like a wake-up call that I had really to react because I put myself in danger, Julien as well. We really had a big accident and that was really the time to react and do something,"" Ogier told RedBull.com at the end of last year. It was testament to his mental resolve that he bounced back so quickly, winning three of the four remaining rallies clinching the title in the final race at the GB Rally in Wales. ""Second place is a first loser,"" he replies when asked what his motto for life might be. ""I'm not the first one to say it but I've always been a fighter, a competitor whatever I was doing in life. (I don't react) the best way when I lose, so when you are like that you have to fight to become the first one."" Ogier has begun 2015 where he left off last year, driving to victories at the opening two races in Monte Carlo and Sweden. The sequence extends his winning streak of rallies to four and few will be betting against the flying Frenchman making it five in a row at the next rally in Mexico in March. His rivals may hope that his recent marriage to German TV presenter Andrea Kaiser may soften his desire to win, but with most rally drivers peaking in their 30s, Ogier is perhaps just beginning a run of success that could rival Loeb's historic sequence of titles. But as he's learned from driving a car at breakneck speed, it pays to concentrate on the stretch of road immediately up ahead. ""I don't have such a long plan in front of me -- I just take the year, one after each other. ""For sure, I want to race a few more years but to be honest I really don't know, I always think about the future dreaming about family, children, being a normal person again.""","Sébastien Ogier is the reigning world rally champion .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The monument commemorating the journalist who hurled his shoes at President George W. Bush was taken down a day after it was erected, local officials in Tikrit told CNN. A monument to a shoe thrown at former President Bush is unveiled at the Tikrit Orphanage complex. Assisted by kids at the Tikrit Orphanage, sculptor Laith al-Amiri on Tuesday erected a huge brown replica of one of the shoes hurled at Bush last month by journalist Muntadhir al-Zaidi during a press conference in Baghdad. But officials from Salaheddin province told CNN that the monument was removed after a request from the central government, which has charges pending against al-Zaidi -- now in an Iraqi jail. After the request was made, Iraqi police visited the location to make sure that the shoe monument was removed. ""We will not allow anyone to use the government facilities and buildings for political motives,"" said Abdullah Jabara, Salaheddin deputy governor. Al-Zaidi's angry gesture touched a defiant nerve throughout the Arab and Muslim world. He is regarded by many people as a hero, and demonstrators last month took to the streets in the Arab world and called for his release. The shoe monument, made of fiberglass and coated with copper, consists of the shoe and a concrete base. The entire monument is 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) high. The shoe is 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) long and 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) wide. The orphans helped al-Amiri build the $5,000 structure in 15 days, said Faten Abdulqader al-Naseri, the orphanage director. ""Those orphans who helped the sculptor in building this monument were the victims of Bush's war,"" al-Naseri said. ""The shoe monument is a gift to the next generation to remember the heroic action by the journalist."" Saddam Hussein, the former Iraqi leader toppled by the United States in 2003, was from the Tikrit region. Al-Zaidi marked his 30th birthday in jail earlier this month. One of his brothers told CNN he ""in good health and is being treated well."" Al-Zaidi's employer, TV network al-Baghdadia, keeps a picture of him at the top left side of the screen with a calendar showing the number of days he has spent in detention. The network has been calling for his release. By tradition, throwing a shoe, is the most insulting act in the Arab world.

"At first, Felisha Archuleta thought her young son's affinity for wearing dresses, primping his hair and playing with Barbies and Bratz dolls indicated he was going through a stage. But Bobby Montoya's interest in ""girl stuff"" has not been short-lived: He's grown his hair out and has dressed as a girl when he can for much of his 7 years. Bobby's been ""outspoken"" about his gender identity, said Archuleta. The Denver, Colorado, family's recent attempt to sign up Bobby with Girl Scouts, however, left him in tears, his mother said. A leader said he could not join because of his ""boy parts,"" Archuleta told CNN affiliate 9News. The Girl Scouts of Colorado has since said it was an ""inclusive"" organization and ""if a child lives life as a girl"" he or she is welcome to join. ""When a family requests membership for their daughter, we do not require proof of gender, we respect the decisions of families."" Archuleta doesn't label her son, who has been bullied and taunted. ""I consider Bobby to be born in the wrong body."" The Colorado case has brought to light questions about labels and the rapidly evolving discussion about gender non-conforming children. ""A person is going to be who they are going to be,"" said Boston-based family therapist Terry Real. ""These children are operating in a hostile environment. As a parent, you are navigating a child in two poles -- authentic to their feelings, the other being on the brunt end of ill treatment."" Despite the uphill battle, psychologists and therapists speak of a ""sea change"" toward growing acceptance of children who don't meet long-held cultural norms. And, they point out, families have more resources to learn about gender variance, including websites and peer and support groups. It can be a complicated discussion, especially when terms like tomgirl, gender fluid or transgender are bandied about. The terms sex and gender are often used interchangeably, particularly on official forms, but sociologists say they are not the same thing. Sex refers to biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women. Gender refers to socially constructed roles and behaviors society considers appropriate for men and women. Gender identity and sexual orientation also are different. Sexual orientation refers to an individual's enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attraction to another person, whereas gender identity refers to one's internal sense of being male, female, or something else, according to the American Psychological Association. Transgender children and adults are ""people who are being assigned one gender but affirm that they are the other,"" said Diane Ehrensaft, a San Francisco Bay Area developmental and clinical psychologist and author of ""Gender Born, Gender Made."" There is little consistent advice for parents, because robust data and studies about transgender children are rare. The rates of people who are transgender vary from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 1,000, depending on various international studies. Gender non-conforming children who do not receive support from their families are at higher risk for mental health issues, attempted suicide and drug use, said Real, citing research at the Family Acceptance Project. In some cases, parents should strongly consider working with a gender-sensitive therapist, he said. ""They have experience in helping a child and parent with difficult decisions,"" Real said. ""Things like disclosure, how do you talk about it, do you wear your hair long. ... It is the responsibility of the parent to deal with the needs of this child. There are minute-to-minute questions."" The Family Acceptance Project, based at San Francisco State University, has produced videos to support families of transgender children. Research has shown  that a high proportion of lesbians, gays and bisexuals are gender non-conforming, said Caitlin Ryan, director of the center. People can be gender non-conforming and heterosexual, she adds. Ryan said parents of non-conforming children should learn more about neighborhood schools. ""Parents need to find out what the school policies are,"" Ryan said. ""Do the teachers have training? Is the school environment overall supportive?"" But experts also said parents must be prudent. ""In some cultures it may not be safe to send your boy to a school in a dress. You can work with schools,"" said Ehrensaft. '""Support would be to tell the child it is an unfair world and there may be some places it is not safe to be who you want to be. It is not your fault, it is their fault."" Sarah Hoffman, a writer and activist in the Bay Area, blogs about ""parenting a boy who is different."" The writer, who said she uses a pseudonym to protect the safety of her family, said her son, Sam, 9, represents the gender spectrum -- one foot in the masculine world, one foot in the feminine. For that, she said, her son has endured bullying. Sam sees himself as a boy but has liked tiaras and dresses, Hoffman said. While he has long hair, Sam now usually wears masculine clothes. ""He is just a mix,"" Hoffman told CNN. ""The problem is not our kids,"" Hoffman said. ""The problem is our culture not accepting kids."" Hoffman said some readers have called her a weak parent for letting Sam express himself. Ehrensaft said she has received e-mails from critics telling her to read the Bible and ""see God's way."" Ehrensaft and Ryan said they have assisted people who are socially and religiously conservative. ""We help them balance their beliefs with what is happening with their child,"" said Ryan. In general, fathers have a harder time accepting gender variance than mothers, experts say. And the culture more often raises eyebrows when a boy dresses as a girl than when a girl looks masculine. ""Girls have more license to express a range of gender presentations until they get into junior high,"" said Ryan. By then, they are expected to be interested in boys. The researcher and others stress the importance of parents paying close attention to children showing gender non-conformity. ""They know what feels right to them. They know what clothes they want to wear,"" Ryan said. ""They very clearly know who they are."" Parents need to be careful not to rush to a diagnosis and predict a child's eventual sexual orientation or gender identity, experts said. For example, a child dressed in drag may be depressed and looking for attention -- but not have a gender issue. ""You have to live in a state of not knowing for a while,"" said Ryan. ""They are exploring their gender. The most important thing is to give them space for exploration. If you categorize them at age 3, that could be a big mistake."" Families also should be aware of what may lie ahead, Real said. There could be discussion of delayed puberty and hormone therapy to decrease certain anatomical attributes. Joel Baum, director of education and training at Gender Spectrum, which promotes an ""inclusive environment,"" said ""more and more families are seeing their children express themselves a little differently from what others believe. They are kind of saying, 'I am going to see where this goes.'"" ""We don't talk about the damage we do when we don't allow a kid to explore this aspect of self,"" Baum said. Not everyone is happy with that approach. Regina Griggs, executive director of Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays & Gays, a group that works with people who no longer practice gay, lesbian or transgender lifestyles, said of transgender individuals: ""If they aren't helped to celebrate their true gender they will be confused."" Gender confusion can be sign of a treatable mental disorder, according to Griggs. The American Psychiatric Association is reviewing its current definition of gender identity disorder. Whether a person has a disorder is dependent on how much mental distress it causes, according to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, composed of doctors, psychologists and others professionals. Simply dressing in a non-traditional way does not mean the person has a disorder. Ehrensaft stressed parents need to become resilient to critics. ""I'm not letting my child do something,"" parents might state, she says. ""I am listening to who my child is."" Felisha Archuleta, who has two older children, said Bobby is still interested in joining the Girl Scouts, but not the same unit he first came in contact with. The Girl Scouts of Colorado is taking such situations ""on a case by case basis,"" said spokesperson Rachelle Trujillo. ""This is a pretty new thing for us."" ""I have absolutely heard of many situations of transgender kids who are absolutely living as a girl. Girl Scouts shouldn't be any different for them,"" she said. Archuleta said her son doesn't need counseling and does not the dress the way he does because of his environment. ""I know it's going to be a really hard road for Bobby,"" Archuleta said. ""I feel if we are there for him, we will get through it together.""","A 7-year-old Colorado boy who dresses as a girl wants to join the Girl Scouts .

"I'm relaxing at home on the couch watching TV, and everything seems to be about the Olympics. I can't seem to avoid the constant reminder of where I would like to have been at this moment: in Sochi, Russia. I change the channel to NHL hockey, and now I am confronted with the images of guys who I grew up with and played against, skating with the pros!  How much can one athlete endure? Well, I can tell you from a personal standpoint, it's quite a lot. CAT scans, MRIs, hours in physical therapy, pool exercises while wearing a hard plastic torso brace that I took off only to shower, Z-joint injections and plenty of non-steroidals were my life for my year spent off the ice. Sometimes I questioned myself: Was it really worth it? Absolutely! I have always wanted to be the best, and it drives me every day, no matter the obstacle. I had dreamed of playing in the NHL until bilateral fractures of L4 (one of the lumbar vertebrae in the lower back) derailed that quest. My teammates, friends and family were very supportive, and my desire to return to the ice was unquestioned.  However, the possibility of recurrent injury and perhaps never walking pain-free again steered me in the direction of figure skating. 'Don't put limits on your dreams' In retrospect, what was I thinking?  Quadruple jumps, triple axels ... hockey might have been a less injurious endeavor. The long days of multiple repetitions, weights and stretching with the physical therapists reinforced a mental strength that I had developed over years of elite competition. Nothing was going to stand in my way of returning to the ice. I hope that my work ethic has been a model for those who do not believe in themselves or have lingering doubts about their own abilities. Nothing makes you try harder than to be told that you are not good enough or that you simply do not have the skills. Fast-forward to the the U.S. Nationals in San Jose, California.  I trained with a single focus: to medal in my first senior competition. However,  I let my my nerves get to me, and I finished eighth. A few months of soul-searching and some encouragement from my mom and dad put me back in the game. Anyone who thinks I can't doesn't really know Max Aaron. I love hard work. If I'm not sweating, then I'm not working. Surround yourself with positive people. Don't back down. All the things that I learned from playing hockey could be translated to competing in figure skating.  Happily, I didn't have to spend time in the box! Omaha, Nebraska, January 2013: the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. I felt confident.  It was my time.  A couple of silly errors in the short program left me within striking distance, exactly where I wanted to be going into the long program. Time to drop the gloves. I didn't want my long program to end. It felt better than a hat trick, and I won. Being the champion comes with expectations and new pressures. You need to adjust. Going to the World Championships as a senior international debut! No problem. My coaches reminded me to stick with the process that had gotten me to that point. Heading into the fall of 2013, I was feeling confident but knew that sometimes you need even more than hard work. We created a challenging long program for the Olympic season with three quadruple jumps. Olympian transplant survivor: 'Enjoy the ride' I still believe that it was a great strategy, but maybe not in an Olympic season. At the end of the day, I've always learned from my experiences. I skated clean in practice numerous times. In competition, I struggled a bit. Going into the U.S. trials, I decided to stick with jump passes that were more familiar to me. I took a slightly less risky program into Boston for the 2014 Championships.  The short program was respectable, not my best. For the long, ""just do what you did last year,"" I told myself. But a couple of minor errors left the door open, and terrific skates from others left me at the doorstep of another dream. NHL hockey ... nope. Sochi Olympian ... nope. Time to turn the page again. The fire within burns until I alone extinguish that flame. Don't take no for an answer. It is these truths that I hope I can inspire others with, whether in athletics or just people facing adversity in life of any kind. FYI, I turned the channel back to the Olympics after watching some great hockey that cold winter's day. Watching the figure skating that day threw fuel on my fire to work toward the World Championships in Japan and competitions beyond.

"Protesters rallied outside the Chicago campaign headquarters of President Barack Obama on Monday on the last day of the two-day NATO summit. The peaceful nature of the demonstration came in stark contrast to violent clashes that left protesters and eight police officers injured a day before. ""NATO has to go. Everywhere they go, this is the result -- violence against innocents, violence in the service of the international 1%,"" said Joe Iosbaker, an activist. ""We are here to demand accountability, and we're not just talking about the rank and file cops who did the swinging and split skulls. We're talking about (Chicago) Mayor (Rahm) Emanuel and (Chicago) Police Superintendent (Garry) McCarthy,"" he said. Earlier in the day, protesters chanted and tossed paper airplanes as they protested Boeing Corp.'s role as a defense contractor. ""These are peaceful protesters. That's what we expected,"" said superintendent McCarthy. Later in the day, he drew a distinction between protesters and criminals. ""Yesterday was not a clash between protesters and police. That was a clash between criminals and police,"" he told CNN. ""The news isn't what happened. The news is what did not happen."" By early afternoon, protesters had moved on from the heavily guarded Boeing building, where some windows had been covered in anticipation of possible violence. ""It's kind of a celebration,"" protester Blaise Sewell said. ""We effectively shut down Boeing with a Facebook event."" While McCarthy said officers behaved admirably in the face of attacks by protesters Sunday, the Chicago chapter of the National Lawyers Guild accused police, in a statement, of ""indiscriminate violence."" ""Police completely overreacted to protesters approaching the security perimeter and unleashed a violent attack on them without an ability to disperse,"" attorney Sarah Gelsomino of the People's Law Office said in the guild statement. Protesters suffered serious injuries, including broken bones, busted lips and concussions, she said at a Monday rally. The guild has close to 60 accounts of police brutality, Gelsomino said. Security remained tight in Chicago as the summit wound down. Commuters faced a more difficult trip with the closure of 25 stops on the city's Metra train lines, which had been planned earlier. The city's iconic Lake Shore Drive was also to remain closed through much of downtown, city officials said. Speaking inside the the NATO meeting, President Barack Obama thanked the people of Chicago for putting up with the traffic and also the city's mayor and its police force for their work, which he said was done under ""some significant pressure and a lot of scrutiny."" ""This is part of what NATO defends -- is free speech and freedom of assembly,"" he said. A day earlier, police clashed with protesters at the end of a march just blocks from the NATO summit after a they refused police orders to disperse and began pushing against a line of officers clad in riot gear. A video from CNN affiliate WLS showed protesters, some with bloodied faces, struggling against the officers, some of whom struck the demonstrators with batons. The confrontation led to a two-hour standoff between police and protesters. Occupy Chicago said dozens were injured in the clashes, though fewer than a dozen protesters were treated at area hospitals, officials said. McCarthy said Monday that eight officers had been injured, including one who was hospitalized for exhaustion and another who was stabbed in the leg but went back on duty hours later. Police said they arrested at least 45 people Sunday. The National Lawyers Guild estimated 60 arrests Sunday and more than 100 since the summit began. On Sunday, McCarthy said officers responded after protesters assaulted them, and ""the finger should be pointed at the people who assaulted the cops."" On Monday, he said protesters were largely peaceful and blamed Sunday's violence on a group of protesters intent on breaking the law. While police want to protect people exercising free speech rights, he said, they cannot tolerate illegal acts. Police spokeswoman Melissa Stratton also said Monday that some protesters had splashed themselves with fake blood before returning to the protest lines. While some protesters accused police of brutality in Sunday's confrontations, Illinois Lt. Gov. Sheila Simon said Monday that police seemed to be doing a good job. ""I think for the most part, they have been doing a fantastic job of making sure that people are protected and free speech rights are protected as well,"" she said. ""It's a tough balance to get, but I think they are doing a good job.""","Police superintendent draws a distinction between protesters and criminals .

"Each year, 75,000 witnesses identify criminal suspects. Yet, as the New Jersey Supreme Court has acknowledged in a recent landmark case, there is ""a troubling lack of reliability in eyewitness identifications."" In fact, given the risk of executing an innocent person, 16 states ban capital punishment. Yet, in Georgia, Troy Davis faces execution on Wednesday, even though seven out of nine witnesses have recanted their testimony against him. A study released Monday by the American Judicature Society, analyzing 850 photographic lineups, found that mistakes in identification are often related to how the photos of a line-up are presented. It found if a person uninvolved in the case presents the photos one-by-one, rather than all at once, fewer mistakes are made. Another critical factor is whether the authority presenting the photos knows who the suspect is. But it's not only the method of presentation that is skewing justice. It's also fear. I know.  I had my own bout with mistaken eyewitness testimony. A few years ago, on a bright clear sunny afternoon, I was driving on an empty Connecticut country road when a man ran out in front of my car from a field to my left, carrying a VCR in his arms.  The movement, and his incongruous burden, drew my attention. The man froze when he saw my car, and as I passed him our eyes met for a very long moment in the rear-view mirror. I will never forget the jolt of that confrontation.  I didn't understand at the time what I was seeing, but the fear, and something wilder, that I saw in his eyes was palpable. After I passed, he dodged into the bushes on the other side of the road and disappeared. I went on to do the errands of the day, while puzzling about the meaning of what I had just seen.  Four hours later I decided to tell this experience to the police. It was then I found out there had been a robbery in that neighborhood, a VCR had been stolen and a suspect caught.  But before he had been arrested, the suspect shot a police officer, who was in the hospital badly wounded.  The police asked me to make an  identification from a photographic lineup. Here is what I did: Three separate times, I pointed out a photograph of a man with a beard as the man I had seen on the road. As I learned from the subsequent unfolding of the case, the man I had seen on the road had no beard. In four hours, of course, he hadn't had time to grow one.  There was no way that the photograph to which I pointed could have been a picture of the man who was under arrest. I chose the photograph of another man because meeting the suspect's eyes in the rear-view mirror had shocked me so much -- even though I had no conscious knowledge that he had a gun -- that I refused to recognize his face. It was probably because, subconsciously, I never wanted to see him again. This is what it can mean to be a witness to violence. You are not a rational spectator. It doesn't matter if a photograph is set in front of you that depicts the real criminal and no one influences you improperly.  You can still choose an innocent man. We can analyze all the numbers we want, but until we acknowledge more fully the role emotions play, we won't have the data required for the policies we need. Other factors are also instrumental, according to the New Jersey Supreme Court. Findings can be influenced by whether the witness is under a lot of stress, whether the sighting is brief or a weapon is visible, if the witness is a different race from the suspect.  The court recommended that juries be better instructed in how these and other factors can affect the ability to remember correctly. But the AJS study's conclusion is stark: Even if the photos are viewed one by one, culprits were correctly identified only 27% of the time.  According to The Innocence Project, 76% of those who were exonerated based on DNA evidence were convicted, at least in part, by eyewitness accounts. I am a historian of photography and a scholar of visual studies.  I have made my living and my reputation by the sharpness with which I can see, remember and recount the details and meaning of photographs.  By the time I was asked to make this identification from a set of photographs, I had been practicing this profession for over a quarter of a century.  I was used to looking at all kinds of photographs, even mug shots, which are an area of interest for contemporary artists and cultural critics. And I got it wrong. Until we understand what happens when people look at photographs they don't want to see, we will not get the data that will drive better policy. We will continue to get wrongful identifications, wrongful convictions and worse, wrongful executions.","Laura Wexler:  7 out of 9 witnesses recanted testimony against Troy Davis .

"It's not your usual selfie. ""The sensation is happening again,"" Stacey Yepes tells the camera. ""It's all tingling on left side."" ""I don't know why this is happening to me."" The Toronto-area woman was having her third stroke in three days. And this time, she refused to suffer in private. Yepes recorded a selfie video of her symptoms after pulling over while driving. The next day, the video would help doctors at Toronto Western Hospital correctly diagnose her with transient ischemic attacks, or ""mini-strokes,"" due to plaque buildup in her arteries. Now, according to Yepes, she is on cholesterol-lowering medication and blood thinners, and hasn't had any more strokes. The video may have saved her life. No two strokes are alike: My story . Two days before the recording, doctors at a local emergency room in Toronto dismissed her face numbness and slurred speech as stress-related. They told her stroke tests had come back negative and counseled the 49-year-old legal secretary on breathing techniques. Those were ineffective, and Yepes suffered two additional mini-strokes in consecutive days -- the first leaving the hospital parking lot on April 1. She knew something had to be done. ""I think it was just to show somebody, because I knew it was not stress-related,"" she said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. ""And I thought if I could show somebody what was happening, they would have a better understanding."" That was exactly what happened. Yepes filmed the third ""mini-stroke"" the next day en route to work. After arriving, she showed the video to co-workers, who immediately suggested she go to a different hospital. Still, Dr. Markku Kaste with the World Stroke Organization said he believes Yepes was lucky. His advice: ""Don't waste time on a video, just call 911."" He said, ""It's the same thing for everyone. If you're having a stroke, think you're having a stroke or see someone having one -- just call 911."" Kaste and his organization are working on an upcoming campaign targeting women and their likelihood for strokes. According to the National Stroke Organization, 55,000 women have strokes each year. As in Yepes' case, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said signs of stroke generally include sudden numbness, confusion and difficulty walking. The American Stroke Association uses the acronym F.A.S.T -- meaning face dropping, arm weakness and speech difficulty are all signs that it's time to call 911. Usually, paramedics, emergency responders and doctors correctly identify the situation and will get individuals the help they need. ""It's hard to say why there was an incorrect diagnosis (initially), but things like that can happen,"" Kaste said. ""Still, the quicker you are to the hospital, the higher the likelihood of a good outcome."" Related: Recovering from a stroke .

"The Mediterranean diet is a well-known weapon in the fight against heart disease, but exactly how effective is it? To find out, researchers led by Dr. Ramón Estruch, from the Department of Internal Medicine at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, put the Mediterranean diet to the test against a low-fat diet. They followed participants to track rates of heart attack, stroke and heart-disease-related death. After nearly five years, the results were so striking for one group that the study was stopped early, according to research published online by the New England Journal of Medicine. The group that showed the least heart problems and lowest rate of heart disease deaths? Those who ate a Mediterranean diet high in extra-virgin olive oil. Coming in at a close second were participants who ate a Mediterranean diet high in nuts. Compared with those eating the low-fat diet, the extra-virgin-olive-oil group showed a 30% lower risk of having a heart attack, stroke or dying of heart disease after five years, while those consuming the Mediterranean diet with more nuts showed a 28% lower risk of these outcomes. TIME.com: Mediterranean diet linked to lower child-asthma risk . ""We think the strength of this study comes from the fact that we measured hard outcomes and not just blood pressure or changes in cholesterol levels,"" says Estruch. ""We really believe the Mediterranean diet lowers incidence of (heart attack), stroke and cardiovascular deaths."" Previous studies have linked Mediterranean diets to fewer heart attacks and deaths from heart disease, but most of those have correlated people's recall of their diet with heart-disease outcomes rather than randomly assigning participants to eat specific diets and then following them for heart-disease risk, as Estruch and his colleagues did. In the study, the participants in the Mediterranean diet groups agreed to replace red meat with white meat like chicken and eat three or more servings of fish each week, along with three or more servings of fruit and two or more servings of vegetables a day. The extra-virgin-olive-oil group also consumed more than four tablespoons of the oil a day, replacing regular olive oil with the extra-virgin variety, which contains more potentially heart-healthy compounds like polyphenols and vitamin-E tocopherols -- which can lower levels of inflammatory factors that contribute to heart disease -- in addition to oleic acids, which are lower in the saturated fat that can build up in blood vessels. The group that consumed more nuts was asked to eat a combination of 30 grams of walnuts, almonds and hazelnuts every day. These groups were also asked to stay away from sodas and red meats. The participants eating the low-fat diet ate three or more servings of fish or seafood a week and the same amount of fruit and vegetables as the Mediterranean diet groups. They were discouraged from consuming more than two tablespoons of vegetable oils, including olive oil, each day. TIME.com: Can olive oil help prevent stroke? To ensure that other factors that could affect heart-disease rates were not playing a role, the researchers also adjusted for the total amount of calories the groups were eating, since obesity can be a major contributor to heart attack and stroke. Even after making these adjustments, however, the olive-oil group showed statistically significant drops in heart-disease risk. And because the three groups were randomly assigned to their diets, Estruch says that factors like the amount of exercise the participants did, or the medications they took, would be about the same in all three groups, and thus affect all participants equally. Estruch says that the study has some limitations, most notably that the low-fat diet group may not have had as intense an intervention during the first part of the study as the Mediterranean groups did, potentially biasing the results in favor of the Mediterranean diet. Some volunteers also dropped out, most of whom had higher body mass index on average, which may also skew the results toward a beneficial effect of the Mediterranean diet, since the individuals who remained might have been more motivated to take care of their hearts to begin with. Still, the findings add to the body of evidence that suggests the Mediterranean diet can play an important role in protecting the heart, and should guide doctors and patients who want to avoid heart disease toward eating the foods that can help them the most.

"Iran started suspending high levels of uranium enrichment Monday as an interim deal struck with six world powers went into effect, state media reported, making way for more talks and fewer sanctions. All of its voluntary moves will be completed by Monday evening, Iran's nuclear spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi told state-run news agency IRNA. The United States and European Union announced that they were suspending certain sanctions for six months as part of the deal. ""In reciprocation for Iran's concrete actions, the United States and its P5+1 partners -- the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China -- as well as the European Union will today follow through on our commitment to begin to provide the modest relief agreed to with Iran,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney. ""At the same time, we will continue our aggressive enforcement of the sanctions measures that will remain in place throughout this six-month period."" Iran stopped enrichment of uranium to the 20% purity level and disconnected cascades of centrifuges enriching uranium in Natanz, a top nuclear official told state-run Press TV. A centrifuge is a mechanism used to enrich uranium. ""From now on, the centrifuges which were used for producing 20% enriched uranium will be used for enriching uranium to the 5% purity level,"" said Mohammad Amiri, a director in the nation's nuclear agency. Iran's nuclear capabilities . International inspectors were present when Iran started implementing the historic deal, Press TV said. The action is part of a six-month interim agreement that gives Iran and the other countries more time to negotiate a permanent solution. Iran struck the deal on November 24 in exchange for lighter sanctions. Tehran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful, civilian energy purposes, despite concerns from the West that it's a guise for working toward a nuclear weapons program. Nuclear power plants use uranium that is enriched to 5% as fuel to generate electricity. As part of the agreement, Iran must eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium, dismantle some infrastructure that makes enrichment possible, and allow broader and more intrusive inspections of its programs. The six nations and the European Union are reviewing a report by the U.N. watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which provided details of the nuclear activities on the first day of the deal, according to the U.S. State Department. ""This is an important day in our pursuit of ensuring that Iran has an exclusively peaceful nuclear program,"" said Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief. She said she's optimistic a new round of negotiations could come soon. Obama makes case on why Congress should not add sanctions on Iran . ""Depending on how things work out today, I hope that we will start talks in the next few weeks,"" Ashton said. If all conditions are met, Iran will get sanctions relief totaling about $7 billion, including access to $4.2 billion in frozen assets, during the six months the interim deal is in effect. ""The psychological effects of the lifting of sanctions will create a new atmosphere in the country,"" said Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi, according to IRNA. For years, Iran and Western powers have left negotiating tables in disagreement, frustration and open animosity. The diplomatic tone changed last year when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was elected. And the deal appeared to be on the right track Monday. As part of the deal, Iran was required to dilute its stockpile of uranium that had been enriched to 20%. While uranium isn't bomb-grade until it's enriched to 90% purity, ""once you're at 20%, you're about 80% of the way there,"" said Mark Hibbs, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The deal also mandates Iran halt all enrichment above 5% and dismantle the technical equipment required to do that. World leaders applauded the interim deal after years of a stalemate. ""For the first time in nearly a decade, we have halted the progress of the Iranian nuclear program,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said when the deal was announced in November.","U.S. and EU suspend some sanctions for 6 months .

"(CNN) -- More than 100 countries attending a conference in Dublin, Ireland formally adopted a treaty Friday to ban cluster bombs -- a large, unreliable and inaccurate weapon that often affects civilians long after the end of armed conflict. Ali Wansa, a 44-year-old Lebanese national, lost his leg to a cluster bomb. The countries agreed never to use cluster munitions or the explosive bomblets they contain, and they also agreed never to develop, acquire, retain or transfer cluster munitions, according to the official treaty document. The 111 countries attending the two-week meeting agreed to the treaty Wednesday but formally signed it Friday. The countries said they are ""deeply concerned"" about civilians suffering the long-term effects of cluster bombs. They are ""concerned that cluster munition remnants kill or maim civilians, including women and children, obstruct economic and social development, including through the loss of livelihood, impede post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction, delay or prevent the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, can negatively impact on national and international peace-building and humanitarian assistance efforts, and have other severe consequences that can persist for many years after use,"" the document said. In addition to calling for a total, immediate ban of the weapons, the international accord calls for strong standards to protect those injured by them and to make sure that contaminated areas are cleaned up as quickly as possible and that the weapons are immediately destroyed, a spokesman for the Cluster Munition Coalition told CNN. Some of the biggest makers and users of cluster bombs cited by human rights groups -- such the United States, Russia, China and Israel -- were not involved in the talks and did not sign the accord. Organizers expressed hope that those nations would nevertheless be pressured into compliance. ""Even though we all know that there are important states not present, I am also convinced that together we will have succeeded in stigmatizing any future use of cluster munitions,"" said Micheal Martin, Ireland's minister for foreign affairs. Martin said he ultimately wants to see all U.N. member states ratify the treaty. The agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years, said Thomas Nash, coordinator of the Cluster Munition Coalition. Cluster munitions, which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets, are what the International Committee of the Red Cross has called a ""persistent humanitarian problem."" Most of a cluster bomb's bomblets are meant to explode on impact, but many do not. Credible estimates show the weapons fail to explode on impact between 10 and 40 percent of the time, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. That means unexploded bomblets lie scattered across a target area, often exploding only when handled or disturbed -- posing a serious risk to civilians. Earlier this month, a U.S. State Department representative called it ""an absolute moral obligation"" to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after the battle. But Acting Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Stephen D. Mull said the United States was attempting to solve the problem through a disarmament body called the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, or the CCW, which meets in Geneva and comprises major military powers and military trade producers. The CCW is to meet next in July. The United States would not agree to any ban because the country considers cluster munitions an important part of its defense strategy, Mull said. He urged regulation of the weapons to render them harmless after battle. During the 34-day war in Lebanon in 2006, the United Nations estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets, 1 million of which may not have exploded, according to the ICRC. More than 250 civilians and bomb-disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern Lebanon since the war ended. Cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in Kosovo. ""Very quickly after the Kosovo conflict, the major killer of civilians (was) not antipersonnel mines or anti-vehicle mines or conventional munitions, but these munitions,"" said Lt. Col. Jim Burke, a military adviser to the Irish Defense Forces. In more than 20 countries, according to the ICRC, cluster bombs have created lasting ""no-go"" areas, rendering them as dangerous as minefields. Laos is the most affected country. Millions of bomblets dropped during the Vietnam War continue to kill civilians more than three decades later. Still, militaries consider cluster bombs important for use against multiple targets dispersed over a wide area, such as tanks or military personnel moving across the landscape. A single bomb containing hundreds of submunitions can cover more than 18 square miles.","111 countries formally agreeing treaty banning cluster bombs .

"China has evacuated more than 3,000 of its citizens from Vietnam and is sending ships to retrieve more of them after deadly anti-Chinese violence erupted last week over a territorial dispute between the two countries. Five Chinese ships will travel to Vietnam to help with the evacuation, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported Sunday, citing the Ministry of Transport. One of the ships has already set off from the southern island province of Hainan, the ministry said. Sixteen critically injured Chinese citizens were flown out of Vietnam on Sunday morning on a chartered medical plane organized by Chinese authorities, Xinhua said. Two Chinese citizens were killed and more than 100 others were injured in the violence that hit parts of Vietnam last week, according to the news agency. Some of the worst violence appeared to have taken place in the central coastal province of Ha Tinh. Foreign factories, particularly those run by companies from China and Taiwan, were burned and looted by rioters outraged over Beijing's decision to send an oil rig into waters of the South China Sea that both countries claim as sovereign territory. Protests spin out of control . Vietnamese authorities initially allowed protests, which are usually forbidden in the country, to take place over the Chinese move. But after the unrest spiraled lethally out of control, the government tried to rein in its angry citizens. On Saturday, the government sent out a series of text messages to cell-phone users saying Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung was urging people ""not to participate in illegal protests that cause public disorder and harm social safety."" Chinese officials have repeatedly called on Vietnam to take action over the riots, protect Chinese citizens and help victims. Vietnamese authorities have arrested hundreds of suspects and started legal proceedings against several of them, Vietnam's state-run news agency VNA reported Saturday, citing Minister of Public Security Tran Dai Quang. He described the attacks as regrettable, saying dozens of police officers were injured as they tried to bring the situation under control. Ships clash at sea . But out in the South China Sea, neither side appears to be showing any sign of backing down over the territorial dispute that sparked the violence. VNA on Saturday accused China of continuing to show ""its aggressiveness by sending more military ships"" to the area around the oil rig. Vietnam has demanded that China immediately withdraw the rig from the disputed waters. The news agency cited Nguyen Van Trung, an official at the Vietnam Fisheries Surveillance Department, as saying that China had 119 ships in the area on Saturday morning, including warships, coast guard vessels and fishing boats. Some of the ships were provoking the Vietnamese vessels by ramming them and firing water cannons at them, he said. 'We are not afraid of trouble' China, for its part, has continued to accuse Vietnamese ships of similar acts, saying they are trying to disrupt the oil rig's drilling operation. It has declared a three-mile exclusion zone around the rig, which is operated by the state-owned oil and gas company CNOOC. ""We do not make trouble, but we are not afraid of trouble,"" Gen. Fang Fenghui, the chief of the general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), said Thursday during a visit to the United States. ""In matters of territory, our attitude is firm. We won't give an inch,"" Fang said after meeting U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey. U.S. concerns . Relations between China and Vietnam soured earlier this month, when the Chinese platform began drilling for oil near the Paracel Islands, which are claimed by both countries. At the time, the U.S. State Department called the move ""provocative,"" saying it ""raises tensions."" Beijing has laid claim to most of the South China Sea, putting it at odds with several of its neighbors in the region, including the Philippines and Malaysia. China is also locked in a bitter dispute with Japan over a group of tiny islands in the East China Sea. ""We have to acknowledge there are territorial disputes,"" including ""what exactly is the status quo and who is seeking to change it,"" Dempsey said Thursday at the news conference with Fang of the PLA. His comments were a veiled reference to Washington's view that Beijing is attempting to change the status quo by more aggressively seeking to establish control over disputed areas.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- About 1,000 protesters gathered in front of Kabul University on Tuesday morning, as protests continue throughout Afghanistan to condemn the burning of a Quran by a pastor in the United States. The demonstrators marched toward the city center amid a heavy police presence but without incident, said Kabul City police official Abdullah Mahboob. The sight was in marked contrast to earlier demonstrations, some of which turned deadly. On Sunday, police and stone-throwing demonstrators clashed in Kandahar with as many as three people killed in the violence. At least nine people were killed and 73 injured in Kandahar on Saturday, and 12 people died Friday -- including seven U.N. employees -- when angry demonstrators stormed a U.N. compound in Mazar-i-Sharif. The demonstrations were sparked by the actions of a controversial Florida pastor who presided over what he called a trial of the Quran on March 20. The holy book of Islam was ""found guilty"" by members of Jones' tiny church and burned, according to a release posted on the church's website. Afghan President Hamid Karzai strongly condemned the burning as did various U.S. officials, including U.S. President Barack Obama. ""The desecration of any holy text ... is an act of extreme intolerance and bigotry,"" he said Saturday in a statement released by the White House. ""However, to attack and kill innocent people in response is outrageous, and an affront to human decency and dignity.""","The protests go off without incident .

"A body encased in concrete and buried in a Georgia backyard has been identified as that of a former Florida journalist who went missing in August. The positive identification of 30-year-old Sean Dugas was made using dental records and facial bone CT scans, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Friday. Dugas, a former crime reporter at the Pensacola News Journal, had been missing since August 27. William and Christopher Cormier, twin 31-year-old brothers, are charged with murder in Dugas' death, according to police in Winder, Georgia, where the body was found. The brothers had earlier been charged with concealing a death in the case. Winder police went to the home of the brothers' father on Monday, acting on information from Pensacola police, Winder Police Chief Dennis Dorsey said. The father said his sons arrived from Florida three weeks ago, and the brothers told their father they had been caring for the missing man's dog but ended up killing the dog, Winder police said. The dog was buried in the backyard of a home that the father is renting, Dorsey said. In the yard, police unearthed a body in a plastic storage container that had been encased with concrete, Dorsey said. Authorities believe the body was buried about three weeks ago, and the concrete may have been purchased at a Home Depot, Dorsey said. When the two brothers arrived at their father's home during the police investigation, they were detained, Dorsey said. The father hasn't been charged and is cooperating with investigators, Dorsey said. Managing Editor Ginny Graybiel of the Pensacola News Journal said Dugas worked at the newspaper from 2005 to 2010. ""He started as a clerk and became a police reporter -- along the way he did a good bit of entertainment coverage,"" Graybiel said. ""Sean was a very gentle, good-hearted soul. To be the victim of a crime like this is, of course, something we never could have imagined."" Dugas' girlfriend noticed he was missing August 27 when she went to pick him up at home for lunch that day, Pensacola Police Capt. David Alexander said in a statement. When she returned to the home on September 7, she found it empty except for a television, Alexander said. A man who also lived at the house was gone, police said. The girlfriend reported to police on September 13 that Dugas was missing, Alexander said.","Authorities use dental records to identify remains of Sean Dugas .

"(CNN) -- The international effort to respond to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria begs the question: Why intervene now, and not earlier in the civil war? More than 100,000 people have died in the conflict, which has raged for more than two years. There have been massacres. Populated areas have been bombed. Blasts have targeted people lining up for food at bakeries. People have been decapitated. Millions of Syrians are displaced. But a single, horrifying attack has crossed what U.S. President Barack Obama called a ""red line."" Rebel officials say more than 1,300 people, including many women and children, died recently as a result of chemical weapons. The United States believes Syria was behind it; rebels blame the Syrian government as well. The Syrian regime denies it, and some Syrians have told CNN they doubt their government used chemical weapons. Given the massive human toll of attacks with conventional weapons, what makes this a potential turning point for the world to act? What justifies intervening if Syria uses chemical weapons? Conventional attacks called no 'less evil' ""Blowing your people up with high explosives is allowable, as is shooting them, or torturing them,"" complains Dominic Tierney, political science professor at Swarthmore College. ""But woe betide the Syrian regime if it even thinks about using chemical weapons!"" In a column in The Atlantic, Tierney -- author of a book on what he calls ""the American way of war"" -- adds, ""A woman and her child under fire in Aleppo might miss this distinction. It's not obvious that high explosives are inherently less evil than chemical weapons."" Writer Paul Waldman makes similar comments in The American Prospect: ""Getting killed by mustard gas is surely awful. But so is getting blown up by a bomb. Using one against your enemies gets you branded a war criminal, but using the other doesn't."" And the Los Angeles Times' Paul Whitefield writes, ""Bombs blowing up buildings, which fall on innocent civilians -- men, women, children -- that's bad, but not cause for us to act? But a chemical weapons attack: That we can't allow? Spare me."" Missile strikes on Syria likely response to chemical attack . Obama tells CNN: U.S. interests at stake . The White House argues there's good reason to view chemical weapons attacks differently. ""The use of chemical weapons is contrary to the standards adopted by the vast majority of nations and international efforts since World War I to eliminate the use of such weapons,"" spokesman Jay Carney said this week. "".... The use of these weapons on a mass scale and a threat of proliferation is a threat to our national interests and a concern to the entire world."" He added, ""Without question, there is ongoing barbarity in Syria, perpetrated by the Assad regime, and we have provided substantial assistance to the Syrian opposition and will continue to provide substantial assistance to the Syrian opposition in their struggle with Assad."" Obama, in an interview with CNN last week, said, ""When you start seeing chemical weapons used on a large scale... that starts getting to some core national interests that the United States has, both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region."" Gingrich: Stay out of Syria's civil war . More than 1 million killed since World War I . The Geneva Protocol, signed in 1925, banned chemical weapons attacks. It was a response to one of the horrors of World War I, in which chemical agents -- including chlorine, phosgene (a choking agent) and mustard gas (which inflicts painful burns on the skin) caused nearly 100,000 deaths, according to the United Nations. But since World War I, chemical weapons have killed more than a million people, the U.N. says. ""The Cold War period saw significant development, manufacture and stockpiling of chemical weapons,"" the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs says. The most notorious case in recent history came in 1988, during the Iran-Iraq War. Saddam Hussein used them against Kurds in Iraq's Kurdish city of Halabja, and against Iranian troops. In 1992, the Chemical Weapons Convention was adopted, calling for the prohibition on chemical weapons. 'Should we have any boundaries in war?' Some analysts say it makes sense for the United States and the world to respond differently to chemical attacks. ""They're so indiscriminate,"" says Don Borelli, a former FBI official now with The Soufan Group, a security consultancy. ""At least there's some discrimination in conventional weapons."" ""Modern weaponry, while it's grown more lethal, has also grown more precise,"" says Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official now with the American Enterprise Institute. But chemical agents disperse to affect large numbers of people and ""can produce horror for a lifetime."" Some conventional attacks do the same, he acknowledges. But there's another reason that it makes sense to view a chemical attack as a reason for international intervention, Rubin says. ""We want to establish the parameters of warfare. If you don't, combatants will keep pressing the boundaries. Ultimately, the question is, should we have any boundaries in war or not?"" It's a slippery slope, he says. If a chemical weapons attack goes unchecked, what about some other form of weapon of mass destruction -- a biological or nuclear attack? Some chemical attacks have gone unchecked. In the current conflict, chemical weapons are alleged to have been used on a smaller scale several times. And Foreign Policy reports this week that says the United States, back in 1988, ""helped Saddam as he gassed Iran."" Rubin said he doubts that. But either way, he said, ""There's a fundamental question: Should we learn from our mistakes? If we did the wrong thing should we simply sit by the wayside and allow that to happen again?"" The United States and other countries, he said, want to ""restore a stigma"" against chemical weapons that was in place in the world's psyche ""after World War I and Halabja."" Intervening in Middle East turmoil: Mission impossible? Analyst: Chemical weapons' impact 'exaggerated' Tony Cordesman, a former Defense Department official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says the image people have of chemical weapons is often exaggerated. ""Chemical weapons attacks are not necessarily any more horrifying than the use of conventional weapons,"" he said Tuesday. And ""the lethality has always been far worse on paper than in reality."" There are no definitive statistics on how many people were killed in Halabja, he says. The prevailing image many people have is still from World War I, ""which was the last really mass use of chemical weapons,"" Cordesman adds. Tierney, in The Atlantic, suggests a ""strategic self-interest"" for the United States to oppose chemical weapons. ""Powerful countries like the United States cultivate a taboo against using WMD partly because they have a vast advantage in conventional arms,"" he writes. ""... Washington can defeat most enemy states in a few days -- unless the adversary uses WMD to level the playing field."" Rubin rejects that argument, saying the U.S. advantage in weapons of mass destruction precludes any possibility of a level playing field. And while the alleged previous, smaller-scale use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war were not enough to bring about calls for action, he said, ""This is such a blatant example, we can't pretend not to see it.""","More than 100,000 people have died in Syria, the vast majority through conventional attacks .

"A company in China reportedly used giant 3-D printers to make 10 houses in one day.  This leads to two obvious questions. First, how big were those printers? The answer is: 10 meters wide by 6.6 meters high. A mixture of cement and construction waste were sprayed to build the walls layer by layer. And second, if 3-D printers could be used to create a neighborhood of full-sized, detached single family homes in less time and money than it would conventionally take, could 3-D printers help end homelessness? I'm not Pollyanna-ish when it comes to ending poverty. Many of the world's problems stem from decades of government policies that fostered inequality and neglect, dynamics that cannot be easily fixed by one solution. At the same time, I'm completely obsessed with 3-D printers, probably because I don't fully understand them, so they seem like magic sent to us from the future by Captain Picard. If these printers can make even a dent in some of the world's most pressing challenges, they would be even cooler in my book. So, what major social and economic problems might we potentially print our way out of?  Here are some possibilities. Hunger . At South by Southwest this year, I got to eat candy that came out of a printer, courtesy of the folks at Deloitte.  Last fall, writer A.J. Jacobs documented in The New York Times an entire meal he and his wife ate that was produced by 3-D printers, including pizza, pasta and dessert. While Jacobs needed the help of several companies and their Ph.D. staff to produce his meal, on Kickstarter, one startup tried to get funding for the ""Foodini:"" a 3-D food printer for home chefs. For now, the technology is too expensive, and like many trends the exploration is happening more in high-end settings (3-D printed caviar, anyone?). But as the costs come down and the technology improves, could there be a 3-D printer making nutritious food in every village around the globe? Perhaps. Homelessness . It's quite a feat for the Chinese company to build 10 homes in one day, but they're not the only innovators. Earlier this year, Professor Behrokh Khoshnevis at the University of Southern California built a giant 3-D printer that can produce a basic house in one day. And in Amsterdam, construction has begun on what appears to be the first multistory -- and aesthetically pleasing -- 3-D printed house.  Of course, homelessness is far more complex than simply a lack of housing. But the ability to create ""affordable housing"" even more affordably would not only help homeless people but also low-income individuals. Disease . I understand stem cells even less than I understand 3-D printing, so I'm not going to say much here except to note that scientists are experimenting with what seems to be impossible but apparently isn't: printing human organs. CNN.com reported on how bioprinters use an ""ink"" of stem cells to print 3-D shapes that can be placed into the human body, where hopefully the cells will be accepted by the existing tissues. Bioprinting has a lot of potential. In 2013, a little girl born without a windpipe got one thanks to a 3-D printer that rendered one out of the girl's own stem cells. A foundation has created a $1 million prize to be awarded to whomever comes up with the first 3-D printed functioning liver, which would be a big deal to the 17,000 Americans waiting for liver transplants — and a huge sign of hope to millions of people worldwide with all kinds of organ needs because of diseases and conditions. Pollution . There are many causes of climate change, one of which is pollution from industrial production. 3-D printing offers many promising alternatives to more traditionally wasteful and dirty manufacturing methods. Rather than having to throw out entire products when one piece needs replacing (""planned obsolescence""), 3-D printing will make it easier to replace parts. Even complex products can be produced and assembled locally rather than shipped from across the continent, which would reduce the carbon footprint. (The raw materials will need to be shipped, but they take up less room.) Money . Printing money is as illegal in three dimensions as it is in two.  And while 3-D printing may never eliminate the need for money, it may change the demand for it. Think about how the Internet reduced the cost of information or how Spotify has reduced the cost of music. Or how cell phones are prevalent all over the world. Imagine years into the future when 3-D printers are just as affordable and available as cell phones. Communities could meet their basic needs -- not just for food but everyday items -- with far less money. Imagine a 3-D printer making plates and cups and toothbrushes and hammers and nails and much more for entire communities, to be shared or bartered for rather than purchased with cash.  And for goods that are bought and sold, 3-D printing could maybe reduce costs without affecting production wages (I'm looking at you, Wal-Mart). The possibilities are so exciting that the World Bank has considered the implications of 3-D printing for reducing poverty and sharing prosperity. Let's hope 3-D printing will truly be as revolutionary as we hope.","A company in China reportedly used 3-D printers to make 10 houses in a day .

"The path to Enlightenment, as any spiritual seeker will testify, can be long and difficult. Unless you take a shortcut. Whether a trip to the McLeod Ganj just above Dharamsala in northern India -- the hometown of the Dalai Lama -- offers an easy route is open to question. For many reaching the seat of the Dalai Lama and current home of the self-declared Tibetan government-in-exile is part of a quest for true happiness and a more altruistic way of life. For some, it's a journey motivated by political activism. And for others, it's simply a port of call on India's hippy trail. I'm heading there to witness one of the Dalai Lama's teaching sessions. The Tibetan spiritual leader holds these around the world throughout the year, but to attend one at his own temple in Dharamsala is considered by many to be nothing short of a pilgrimage. 'Little Lhasa' Leaving Pathankot station on the overnight train from Delhi, I meet Lobsang Rabten, a 27-year-old exiled Tibetan monk, currently based at The Sera Jey Monastery  in Southwest India. Like thousands of others he's on his way to listen to a three-day teaching on wisdom and compassion. We share the two and a half hour taxi ride up through winding hill roads, dense forests and sparsely populated towns. As we approach the McLeod Ganj suburb of Dharamsala or ""Little Lhasa"" as the locals call it, the traditional orange robes of Tibetan Buddhists stand out in ever-greater numbers along the bustling, narrow streets. ""The Dalai Lama's compassion teachings give me strength,"" Rabten says as he leans out the window to enjoy the cool mountain air. ""That is to say I can feel all sentient beings to be the same as me in their desire for happiness and to reduce suffering."" With people from more than 60 countries and simultaneous translations in dozens of languages, the event feels like some kind of global congress. Burning incense . During the event, the Dalai Lama appears each morning at 8 a.m., led by plain clothes armed policemen and followed by a small entourage of a handful of monks carrying pots of burning incense. He makes his way through the temple courtyards, up two flights of stairs and through the back of the main hall. Those who get to shake his hand -- I'm one of them -- talk of an overwhelming feeling of peace and calm followed by a giddy, childlike joy. Lisa Heath, a 62-year-old sculptor from Massachusetts describes her brief encounter as ""simply divine."" Speaking in Tibetan and sometimes English, the Dalai Lama begins the first day with a recap on the importance of secular ethics, universal human values, inter-religious harmony, climate change and the importance of preserving Tibetan culture. Young monks quietly weave their way through the solemn crowds with large, metal jugs of butter tea and warm bread. ""Our whole world is interconnected and the global economy is concerned with the whole world and not only individuals,"" the Dalai Lama says, following his comment with by a deep, roaring laugh that brings a smile to everyone's face. The importance of connection or belonging to a greater whole was evident not only at the teachings but throughout the small hilltop communities in the area. Touring the neighborhoods . Amid peace poles, sacred cows and rows of vendors selling everything from mala prayer beads to crystals and macrame, the temple crowds dissipate. Many of the younger travelers make their way back up the rocky paths to nearby hillside communities of Bhagsu and Dharamkot at the end of the day. Along the way, it's almost impossible to walk past a coffee shop, internet cafe or book store without seeing posters of the Dalai Lama and slogans calling for a free and independent Tibet. While the culture of the towns, Dharamsala and McLeod Ganj, are predominantly Tibetan Buddhist, the small surrounding villages are more Indian and attract an international hippy crowd. In Upper Dharamkot, a village so heavily populated by Israelis even the shop signs and menus are written in Hebrew, there's a large choice of yoga workshops, dream catcher classes and programs in Ayurvedic cleansing -- an ancient natural healing technique in India. The Jewish community organization Chabad House (Dharamkot village, Mcleod Ganj; +91 1892 221005), has one of the largest buildings in town partly to ensure spiritual experimentation does not lead to religious desertion. A typical Friday night dinner here sees hundred of Israelis eating and praying together. A break from the all the spiritual adventure can be found at the Trimurti Garden Cafe (Bhagsunag, Mcleod Ganj; +91 98 1686 9144) in Lower Dharamkot, a little oasis serving the best carrot cake and vegan chocolate cake in the area. How to attend the sessions: . All visitors must register with the Tibetan Branch Security Office in McLeod Ganj near Hotel Tibet or at the temple first. Registration opens only three days before the teaching. Travelers are required to bring two passport size photos and copy of their passport. Attendance passes are issued on the spot and cost less than 50 cents each. More details can be found here: http://www.dalailama.com/teachings/attending-the-teachings. The Dalai Lama offers teachings at Dharamsala a few times every year but also in different places. The next public lectures in Dharamsala are from November 11-13 and December 2-5.

"He's been running all his life, running for freedom, running for peace. It started when he ran away from home at the age of eight. Later he ran away from his homeland, Iran, and spent seven years on a bicycle, pedaling 49,700 miles across 55 countries. In 2002, he reached America. He now lives in a tent in Death Valley. It's been nearly 10 years since Reza Baluchi escaped from Iran. He has run across the United States twice and around its perimeter once. He sets out on every journey with the same mission: to spread a message of world peace. Baluchi plans to begin his next extended run in Israel and finish atop the highest peak on earth -- Mount Everest. His route will take him through the Middle East, including Iran. He'd be going home for the first time since escaping on his bike. ""I got tired of having no freedom,"" he said. ""I would wear a t-shirt and they would stop me. I'd grow out my hair and they'd make me cut it. I traveled out of the country with the cycling team and never came back."" Baluchi grew up in the northern Iranian city of Rasht, the youngest of eight children including a brother permanently traumatized by his service in the Iran-Iraq war. His family barely made a living from their rice farm. He would run seven miles to school, and back home, every day. Baluchi ran away from home after upsetting his mother and getting a beating. He fled on foot, running more than 300 miles to Isfahan where he stayed with his aunt and uncle and continued his schooling. Despite his young age, Baluchi helped support that family by working as a mechanic, running another 14 miles to work after class each day. His athletic abilities didn't go unnoticed; he was recruited to join the national cycling team at 14. Baluchi cycled and won numerous competitions through his teen years. He also fell away from Islam, the state-sponsored religion of Iran. He says he was a peaceful activist -- and got in trouble for associating with dissidents. At 19, he was arrested by a government militia known as the Basij for eating during Ramadan, the holy month when Muslims are expected to fast. Baluchi was wearing a Michael Jackson t-shirt and carrying ""banned pre-revolutionary videotape"" -- a romantic movie. He says he spent the next 45 days imprisoned in a torture cell. ""Every day they tortured me,"" Baluchi said. ""They broke my shoulder; I cried. They would hit me with a baton and burn me with skewers."" He says he was frequently beaten unconscious and, on some occasions, hung from a tree by his wrists. ""My hands had turned completely black from the dead blood; I thought I would have to cut them off. Every day I prayed that I die. Every day I would cry. I thought it would be better if they just killed me so I wouldn't have to suffer."" After questioning his family and investigating his intentions, Baluchi says the Basij deemed him essentially harmless. He was removed from the torture cell, and spent the next 18 months jailed under less threatening conditions. ""I was much more comfortable,"" he said. ""I was running and exercising every day. I also worked as a mechanic on the officers' cars once they realized I wasn't a threat."" Baluchi says running kept him sane during his imprisonment. Once released, he returned to the cycling team. Baluchi and his teammates traveled to Germany for competition. ""At that point, I never wanted to go back to Iran,"" Baluchi said. He spent the next four years competing with the German cycling team. Baluchi was taken aback by the level of admiration and respect he received. He had little education, no income and would sleep wherever he could lay his head. Once he was granted a German passport, he set out for other destinations. With only a backpack and his bicycle, he steered clear of transportation by car or train for fear of getting caught. He says he stopped frequently to help the homeless, despite his own very limited resources. ""While in Morocco I rode by this old man who had torn-up shoes tied onto his feet,"" Baluchi said. ""I gave him my own shoes and the only $2 I had left. Anything that I had, besides my bike, I would give away."" On another African stop, Baluchi says he spent a day rebuilding the roof of a damaged school. He says he made friends everywhere he went, and they took care of him as well. A Portuguese family gave him $2,000, which he mailed to Iran for his family. And a Colombian dentist fixed his teeth for no charge. His life on the road -- running in a security vest adorned with the American and Iranian flags -- took him from China to Panama, France and New Zealand -- 55 countries in all. Communicating the message of love and peace. Eighty-five flat tires later, Baluchi arrived at the U.S. border in Monterrey, Mexico, asking for a visa to enter America. After waiting three months with no document, Baluchi says he got lost while riding his bike in the desert. ""I was 27 miles in Arizona and I had no idea,"" he said. ""I was awakened one morning by a helicopter hovering over my tent. It was border patrol. When they told me I was actually in the U.S. I started crying."" It was a year after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, and a Middle Eastern man riding alone in the desert might raise suspicions. ""I started speaking German, hoping they wouldn't know my nationality. Once the officer searched my tent and saw one of the newspaper headlines 'Iranian Runs Around the World for Peace,' he jumped back and put his hand on his gun."" Baluchi was arrested for entering the United States illegally and spent five months in a detention center, unable to post $5,000 bail. By this time, Los Angeles businessman David Hyslop, intrigued by what he had read of Baluchi's journey for peace, wrote him a letter of support addressed to the detention center. He attached his photo and phone number. ""Three days later the phone rang and sure enough it was Reza speaking his broken English,"" Hyslop said. ""He was convinced he would get political asylum and sure enough, he did."" Baluchi says he convinced the judge to release him on humanitarian grounds, promising to run across America for the victims of 9/11 and donate his only possession -- his bicycle -- to the New York Fire Department. He spent 10 days prepping for the cross-country trek. Hyslop bought him new clothes and rallied the support of local Iranian-Americans. Under his guidance, Baluchi was able to raise several thousand dollars and was donated a motor home. Hyslop decided to leave his partnership in a video systems integration company and volunteered to drive the motor home, cook his meals and be his traveling press agent. ""He ran an average of 29 miles a day for 124 days,"" Hyslop said. ""There was just something about Reza that told me he could do it. And he did."" They left Los Angeles on Mother's Day, planning to arrive in New York City by the second anniversary of Sept.11. They were traveling with a $28,000 donation for the Children's Aid Society, Baluchi's bicycle and ""Rocky,"" a stray dog they picked up along the way. Baluchi arrived to a cheering crowd at Battery Park. The next day he presented his bike to Engine 33, Ladder 9, the closest fire station to Ground Zero. Ten of its 14 firefighters were killed in the response to the World Trade Center attack. ""We found out these guys were also cyclists,"" Hyslop said. ""We pulled up to the fire house and they were standing outside waiting for Reza. There wasn't a dry eye in the house, it was unbelievable."" ""These guys are true heroes,"" Baluchi said. ""They gave their lives to save others. So I wanted to donate my bike from the people of Iran, not from the government. I stay out of the politics."" In 2007, Baluchi laced up his shoes once again. He ran the perimeter of the United States, raising money for the Children's Hospital of Denver. He says he spent 202 consecutive days running a grand total of 11,720 miles. ""Because it was so difficult for me to leave my country and reach America, I ran for children around the world that are also homeless,"" he said. ""It's his personal mission to help others,"" said his former agent Scott Hettermann. ""He doesn't have anything yet he's the happiest person I know. He's a completely nomadic creature."" In 2009, Baluchi ran from Los Angeles to New York City again, and now he's training and planning for his ultimate trip -- a run that will traverse every country on the planet -- a lifelong dream that even his supporters say probably is out of anyone's reach. ""Reza doesn't listen to anyone,"" Hyslop said. ""He has these outsized ambitions that he sets his mind to. He's a success above and beyond anyone's expectations. It's almost biblical. But you gotta be a little crazy to undertake such an endeavor, right?"" Nowadays the 40-year-old Baluchi lives in a tent, and spends his days training in Death Valley, California. In February 2013, he plans to begin his next run for peace in Jerusalem -- the trip that will take him back to where it all started. Baluchi, idealistic to the extreme, admits there is a real danger returning to his home country. ""I don't know if I'll be able to run freely through Iran. I fear that I might not make it, but I'd like to try and see my mother one last time,"" he said. ""Who knows what the regime is going to do,"" Hyslop added. ""We don't know how the government feels about him. He could end up a martyr if he's not careful."" Despite the risk, Baluchi says he refuses to be distracted from his goal. ""I always wanted to give children around the world hope that anything is possible,"" he said. ""Until my heart stops beating, I'll keep running for peace.""","Reza Baluchi aims to run through the Middle East and finish on top of Mt. Everest .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States tortures prisoners in violation of international law, former President Carter said Wednesday. Former President Carter says the U.S. ""has abandoned the basic principle of human rights."" ""I don't think it. I know it,"" Carter told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""Our country for the first time in my life time has abandoned the basic principle of human rights,"" Carter said. ""We've said that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to those people in Abu Ghraib prison and Guantanamo, and we've said we can torture prisoners and deprive them of an accusation of a crime to which they are accused."" Carter also said President Bush creates his own definition of human rights. Carter's comments come on the heels of an October 4 article in The New York Times disclosing the existence of secret Justice Department memorandums supporting the use of ""harsh interrogation techniques."" These include ""head-slapping, simulated drowning and frigid temperatures,"" according to the Times. The White House last week confirmed the existence of the documents but would not make them public. Responding to the newspaper report Friday, Bush defended the techniques used, saying, ""This government does not torture people."" Asked about Bush's comments, Carter said, ""That's not an accurate statement if you use the international norms of torture as has always been honored -- certainly in the last 60 years since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was promulgated. ""But you can make your own definition of human rights and say we don't violate them, and you can make your own definition of torture and say we don't violate them.""  Watch Blitzer's interview with the former president » . After reading a transcript of Carter's remarks, a senior White House official said, ""Our position is clear. We don't torture."" The official said, ""It's just sad to hear a former president speak like that."" Carter also criticized some of the 2008 Republican presidential candidates, calling former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani ""foolish"" for his contention the United States should be open to use force on Iran. ""I hope that he doesn't become president and try to impose his conviction that we need to go to war with Iran,"" Carter said. The Giuliani campaign declined to comment on Carter's criticism. The former president didn't spare the rest of the GOP field either. ""They all seem to be outdoing each other in who wants to go to war first with Iran, who wants to keep Guantanamo open longer and expand its capacity -- things of that kind,"" Carter said. ""They're competing with each other to appeal to the ultra-right-wing, war-mongering element in our country, which I think is the minority of our total population."" Carter declined to say which Republican candidate he feared the most. ""If I condemn one of them, it might escalate him to the top position in the Republican ranks,"" he said. Democratic Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois also drew Carter's criticism for refusing recently to pledge to withdraw all troops from Iraq by the end of their first terms if they win the presidency in 2008. ""I disagree with their basic premise that we'll still be there; I think the American people want out,"" Carter said. ""If there is an unforeseen development where Iraqi people request American presence over a period of time I think that would possibly be acceptable, but that's not my personal preference.""

"The idea of ""wearable robots"" may seem like something out of a movie, but this technology is already being used in real life. Started as a project for the military, the exoskeleton has transformed from a device designed to allow soldiers to lift heavy loads and walk further to one that enables people with disabilities to step out of wheelchairs and stand upright. The ""Ekso"" is a bionic exoskeleton developed by Ekso Bionics that gives paraplegics upright mobility. While the commercial version of the Ekso has recently been made available to hospitals and rehabilitation centers, the company hopes to make the technology more accessible so that people can use it at home and in their everyday lives, with a personal version releasing in 2014. CEO Eythor Bender sat down with CNN to talk about Ekso, the bionic exoskeleton he helped develop. CNN: How many years have you been working on exoskeletons? Bender: We have been working on exoskeletons for the last 10 years. It started as a project with the military and it was funded by DARPA, the same people who funded the Internet and GPS systems. So it was groundbreaking technology, and in the year 2005 we had a breakthrough in terms of making sure that the weight of the exoskeleton transfers all the way down to the ground. So the user who is wearing it -- it usually weighs up to 50 pounds -- doesn't feel the weight at all. And that's so important because obviously you are trying to make their lives easier, not more difficult. CNN: What powers the exoskeleton? Bender: What we are using here is electric motors, and there are four of them, which is actually quite unique especially when you compare it to (technology used by) amputees. Prosthetics so far have usually had one moving component, and in this case you have in one system four moving components. You have four motors -- two sitting at the hips and two at the knees -- and that's what you hear. and it's driven by a battery pack sitting on the back. In the middle, between the two batteries, is a computer and so that is pretty much it. It's an outer frame that pretty much mimics the bone structure. There are 15 sensors in it that almost re-create your nerve system. And then there is the computer, which is really the brain of the whole thing. CNN: What is your long-term hope or vision for this product in terms of helping people on the medical side? Bender: Our hope is simply to help people in wheelchairs to live a fuller life. They already live a pretty full life. They can do pretty much anything except they can't walk, and that is such a basic need if you think about it. We all learn to walk even before we learn to talk, and suddenly in the prime of your life you are deprived of that basic need. We are determined to provide at least a tool that people can have, whether it is about walking for part of the day or it is in the recovery phase or rehabilitation or simply in daily living where people want to go about and do things during the day just like an amputee would use a prosthetic leg during the whole day. CNN: Will the Ekso exoskeleton eventually be available in homes for people to use whenever they want? Bender: Yes. We see it as a companion during the whole day. It's not going to happen overnight for us to get there. We have been on this journey, working with the best rehab centers around the world improving the Ekso and making it better. But at the same time, through working with users in rehab centers, it is helping us take the first step into homes so that we can develop a product -- and it's probably going to be products -- that help people not only to gain their health back or get back on their feet, but simply to become a mobility tool similar to the wheelchair. The wheelchair by the way has been around for 1,500 years and it is pretty much the single mobility tool for people that can do pretty much anything else.","The Ekso is a wearable robot consisting of a motorized frame and computer .

"Video gamers spend tons of time -- for many it's 10,000 hours by age 21 -- battling mythic monsters, shooting aliens and rescuing princesses from digital castles. Adrien Treuille wants to put those efforts to better use. The Carnegie Mellon computer scientist is the creator of two online games -- Foldit and EteRNA -- that put video gamers to work solving epic scientific puzzles. His aim is to make super-boring-sounding scientific mysteries like ""protein folding"" and ""RNA synthesis"" fun and challenging for gamers. The results have been staggering, as Foldit and EteRNA players -- there are about 430,000 of them between those two games, most of them playing Foldit -- continue to make discoveries that had eluded  scientists and their supercomputers. Earlier this month, for example, Foldit players helped solve a puzzle about proteins that could further research into HIV/AIDS. Their work was co-published in the journal Nature. Players know they're working on science puzzles, but the games are meant to be fun. ""One of our goals when we made Foldit is to make proteins toy-like, which is actually a technical term from game design,"" Treuille said in a recent interview at the PopTech conference. ""It should be something you want to play with, like a Lego or a Tinkertoy. ""Proteins are these esoteric things that most people don't know very much about, but through computer graphics and interaction we were able to make them something you can play with and wiggle and pull -- and make them physically real for people. And I think that realness -- that toy-like aspect of proteins -- is what made it ultimately comprehensible to our players, and allowed them to solve problems that elude computer programs."" To get why this is significant you have to understand a little bit about proteins, which Treuille describes as building blocks for life. If scientists can better understand the shapes of proteins, they can do more to build them themselves, which could lead to new methods of disease prevention and treatment. But they need help figuring out how to use these tools. ""We're building with, like, completely new materials,"" he said, ""so we know how to build with hammers but we don't know how to build with As Gs Cs and Us yet."" That's where the games come in. Gamers essentially are teaching scientists and computers how to build with genetic code, by toying with the shapes of RNA and proteins to see what works best. In Foldit, they're awarded points for making proteins that use the least amount of energy. In EteRNA, which launched earlier this year, a Stanford lab actually will create a picture of the sequences made in the game. ""When you create a molecule in the game we actually synthesize it -- we make it for real and we send you back pictures of what you've made,"" he said. Here's more on how that game works: . ""What we actually do is give the players very simple tasks like build a circle, build a star,"" he said. ""These are tasks that are beyond the limits of science today, but through trial and error and being able to play with real molecules through this computer game, people have been able to figure out how to solve these tasks, which is sort of extraordinary."" Treuille has high hopes for gaming's potential to unlock good in humanity -- and impact the real world. ""People can solve much more complex problems online at the edge of human knowledge,"" he said in a PopTech speech, ""and I think we've just scratched the surface.""","Adrien Treuille, a computer scientist, designs games that further science .

"Founded on the heels of America's civil rights movement, the Southern Poverty Law Center  burnished its name with legal wins over white-supremist groups and helped integrate institutions like the Alabama State Police. But it has also stoked anger with the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian policy group that lashed out this week after a 28-year-old gunman stormed their downtown Washington headquarters and opened fire. ""Let me be clear that Floyd Corkins was responsible for firing the shot yesterday,"" said council president Tony Perkins. ""But Corkins was given a license to shoot an unarmed man by organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center that have been reckless in labeling organizations hate groups because they disagree with them on public policy."" Shooting sparks controversy over 'hate' designation . The SPLC has listed The Family Research Council as a hate group since 2010, pointing to what it describes as its anti-gay propaganda and legislative agenda. In 1999, an FRC analyst co-authored a document titled ""Homosexual Activists Work to Normalize Sex With Boys,"" according to the law center. The booklet, which is not available on the FRC website, reportedly argued that ""the primary goals of the homosexual rights movement is to abolish all age of consent laws and to eventually recognize pedophiles as the 'prophets' of a new sexual order,"" according to the SPLC. The group opposes same-sex marriage and lobbied to prevent the repeal of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, which prohibited military service by openly gay men and women. Perkins said the SPLC ""should be held accountable for their reckless use of terminology that is leading to the intimidation and what the FBI here has categorized as an act of domestic terrorism."" The gunman apparently said, ""I don't like your politics"" during the incident, and had been carrying 15 Chick-fil-A sandwiches, a possible connection to the restaurant chain's CEO and his stance against gay marriage. Accusations fly after D.C. shooting . Corkins, a former George Mason University student, had reportedly worked as a volunteer at an organization serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. He allegedly shot a security guard on Wednesday at the building before being wrestled to the ground. But soon after Perkins' comments, the SPLC defended its classification of the council. ""Perkins' accusation is outrageous,"" said Mark Potok, a SPLC Senior Fellow. ""The FRC and its allies on the religious right are saying, in effect, that offering legitimate and fact-based criticism in a democratic society is tantamount to suggesting that the objects of criticism should be the targets of criminal violence."" Conservatives: Shooting is evidence of war on religion . While the SPLC says it distinguishes groups that spread hateful information from violent ones, its final tally, according to Booth Gunter, a SPLC spokesman, largely depends on the answer to a single question: Does a group promote hate? ""It's not an estimate of criminality,"" Gunter said. ""Some are violent and some aren't."" Earlier this month, the Montgomery-based SPLC came under scrutiny after it announced that it had monitored Wade Michael Page, a 40-year-old gunman and former front-man for a white supremacist rock band. Page killed himself in a suburban Milwaukee parking lot on August 5 after fatally shooting six people in a Sikh temple, less than two weeks after a deadly shooting at a movieplex in Aurora, Colorado. Suspect charged in Family Research Council shooting . ""There are thousands of guys like that,"" said Gunter. ""Unless we get some information that he's planning an attack, we don't usually call law enforcement."" The group instead monitors and publishes material about extremist groups, and offers police training, ranging from how to interpret tattoos to what officers should be aware of during traffic stops. Speckled across the SPLC's online map is a hive of red numbers that reveals the nation's ""hate groups."" Information on skinheads, neo-Nazis and Klan members comprise the thousand-plus organizations suspected of spreading hate. Each name is accompanied by a symbol, with characters ranging from a crescent moon, signifying anti-Muslim, to a fist, which points to white nationalism. The privately funded SPLC says it is nonpartisan, funded by member donations and a $223 million endowment. But it has been criticized by groups on the right for leaning left. It was incorporated in 1971, with civil rights activist Julian Bond named as its first president.","The SPLC founded on heels of civil rights movement .

"A security official with the U.S. Embassy in Yemen was shot dead on his way to work Thursday, Yemeni officials said. The killing of Qassim Aqlan, a Yemeni national, bears the hallmarks of al Qaeda, the officials said. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has been blamed for numerous attacks in Yemen. Gunmen on a motorcycle shot at the vehicle Aqlan was in. He died at the scene, Interior Ministry officials said. ""Motorcycle attacks are currently al Qaeda's main tactic,"" a senior Interior Ministry official said, adding that such attacks ""are easier for terrorists to coordinate and plan for."" The shooting took place along Siteen, a main street in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, which is generally considered one of the safest, officials said. The Yemeni president's house is on the same road. ""We are deeply saddened by the killing,"" said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. ""We condemn this vicious act in the strongest terms possible and extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends at this difficult time."" Aklan was a foreign service national investigator for the embassy for the past 11 years, Nuland said in a statement.  ""He was a dedicated professional who will be greatly missed. We are coordinating closely with the Yemeni authorities to investigate this attack and to help bring those responsible to justice."" While some Interior Ministry officials at first said Aqlan was overseeing the investigation into an attack last month on the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, others later told CNN he was not. The U.S. State Department said he was not involved in the investigation. Interior Minister Abdulkader Qahtan is overseeing that investigation, said a Yemeni government official not authorized to speak to the media. Aqlan's death ""sends a message that if you're working with the Americans you'll be targeted no matter who you are,"" the official said. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the embassy in September to protest the video ""Innocence of Muslims,"" which maligns the Prophet Mohammed. The demonstration turned violent, and some protesters broke into the embassy. Clashes between security forces and demonstrators left at least four protesters dead and more than 30 people injured.","The security official was not involved in the embassy attack probe, the U.S. says .

"Torrential rains washed long-buried landmines onto a heavily traveled highway near Chile's border with Peru this week. No one was injured, but activists say the incident is a reminder of the risks such explosive devices pose. ""They are a constant threat. ... This is just reinforcing the need for all governments to clear all contaminated land, or seek assistance in doing so if you're struggling to clear it,"" said Kate Wiggans, a spokeswoman for the Geneva-based International Campaign to Ban Landmines. In the 1970s, Chile placed mines along the South American nation's borders with Peru, Argentina and Bolivia as regional tensions rose during Gen. Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship, which lasted until 1990. Decades later, more than 120,000 antipersonnel mines remain in Chile, according to the Chilean nonprofit Centro Zona Minada (Mined Zone Center). This week's appearance of landmines on the Pan-American Highway forced authorities to close a busy border crossing for two days while teams detonated the explosives. It wasn't the first time the lingering landmines from Chile's military rule have threatened the population, and it won't be the last, said Elir Rojas Calderon, the center's director. Government officials must do a detailed evaluation of Chile's minefields and take swifter action to remove the dangerous explosives, Rojas said. ""It has become a critical situation, affecting a very traveled pathway. And this situation is going to repeat itself. Every year this happens, and it's something that can be controlled and prevented,"" he said. Chilean officials have pledged to clear all the country's landmines by 2020. ""The problem that we have is that it's very difficult work,"" Defense Minister Andres Allamand told CNN Chile this week, noting that many devices are located in remote, high-altitude areas that are difficult to access. Landmines are a global problem extending far beyond the South American country's borders, Wiggans said. Floodwaters have also pushed landmines to the surface in Pakistan and Cambodia, Wiggans said. And they've made some mines sink farther underground, making them more difficult to detect. But that doesn't make them any less dangerous, Wiggans said. ""The only way that you can say that this field is safe is if every single inch of that field has been checked by human beings. ... It's very time consuming and costly,"" Wiggans said. ""Quite often governments won't clear the land. They think, 'oh, the mines are miles away, no one is every going to get hurt by them.'"" In 2010, landmines injured or killed 4,191 people, a 5% increase from the previous year, according to an International Campaign to Ban Landmines report issued late last year. Globally, tens of thousands of victims are living with injuries caused by landmines, Wiggans said, and many of them are seriously maimed and living in poor countries with limited infrastructure and resources to support them. Roughly 80% of the world's countries have signed on to an international treaty banning landmines. Wiggans said other nations have stopped producing the mines, but haven't signed it, including the United States and China.","Landmines ""are a constant threat,"" one activist says .

"American lawyers have never been accused of lacking creativity in seeking to justify the nefarious deeds of their clients.  Texas defense attorney Scott Brown, however, appears to have raised the bar to a new level by asserting the newly minted defense of ""affluenza"" to obtain leniency in a tragic vehicular homicide case arising out of the reckless driving of his very drunk and very rich 16-year-old client,  Ethan Couch. Affluenza may be a contender for a collection of odd and unlikely defenses that can trace their lineage back to the infamous (and some even say apocryphal) ""Twinkie defense."" The notorious junk food defense was asserted in psychiatric testimony as part of a broad claim of diminished capacity caused by depression with at least some success in the 1979 trial of Supervisor Dan White for the assassination of San Francisco  Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. Although White was charged with murder, the jury found him guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. The current claim in Fort Worth, Texas, is that the condition of affluenza, a combination of the words  ""affluence"" and ""influenza"" should immunize Ethan Couch from full responsibility for his actions in killing four people and critically injuring two others. The Oxford Dictionary defines the condition as ""a psychological malaise supposedly affecting young people, symptoms of which include a lack of motivation, feelings of guilt, and a sense of isolation.""  Defense attorney Brown apparently succeeded in convincing soon-to-be retired juvenile Judge Jean Boyd that this spoiled rich kid syndrome diminished Ethan Couch's capacity to distinguish right from wrong. 'Affluenza': Is it real? In the face of prosecution demands for 20 years in the slammer, the judge responded with a sentence of 10 years of probation and rehabilitation. Couch's rich daddy proposes to fund a trip to a $450,000 a year California rehab facility that offers treatment to those with way too much cash and free time on their manicured hands. I wish I was kidding about this, but I am not. Defense psychologist Dr. G. Dick Miller testified that poor Ethan Couch was never properly disciplined by his wealthy parents, eventually driving at age 13, abusing alcohol, and coming to believe that money could buy him out of pretty much any situation where he hurt someone. Affluenza, the shrink suggests, diminished Ethan's capacity to obey the law and tragic consequences followed. Miller's offensive analysis fails to explain why this strange condition is not mentioned in the diagnostic bible of the psychiatric profession, the DSM-5 and its predecessor volumes. Rich kid syndrome, or the more succinct label affluenza, seems to be made of the same empty calories that made the Twinkie defense so offensive to the public at the time it was served up in a 1970s San Francisco courtroom. The facts of the case are as disturbing as one can imagine in a criminal prosecution.   A night that would end in manslaughter and mayhem began with Couch and his friends  stealing beer from a Walmart and then jumping into his flatbed Ford. Then an intoxicated  Ethan Couch recklessly drove the truck at 70 mph in a 40 mph zone and smashed  into the four helpless victims, ending their  lives and shattering the lives of their families. Opinion: All the injustice money can buy . When Couch's Ford F-350 truck finally stopped, the carnage was stunning.  The young driver, whose blood-alcohol level tested at three times the legal limit (.24), had snuffed out the lives of Brian Jennings, a 43-year-old youth pastor; Shelby Boyles,  21, and her 52-year-old mother, Hollie Boyles; as well as 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell. Two of the seven teens who were riding in Couch's truck were also critically injured.  One of them, Sergio Molina, who had been riding in the bed of the truck, was paralyzed.  After emerging from a coma, he can reportedly only communicate through eye-blinking. Judges are human and they make mistakes as we all do. Juvenile proceedings are particularly difficult, because the judicial system seeks to rehabilitate rather than punish children who make mistakes. Here, though, the crime is so serious and the explanation of affluenza so transparently preposterous, the judge demeans the entire justice system by affording it any legitimacy. In a system where rich and poor are supposed to be treated equally, affluenza as a defense is an insult to us all. Lady Justice, displayed in courthouses across the nation, wears a blindfold to immunize her from the impact of wealth and power as she weighs only the relative strength of evidence on her justice scale. The wrong message has been sent in this case about wealth, power and  the penalty for killing others while recklessly driving in an intoxicated state. The law exists to rehabilitate but also to deter unlawful conduct by the rich as well as the poor. A wise judge presented with the claim of affluenza as a defense to manslaughter would have responded in a very different way.  Ethan Couch, his lawyer and his wealthy father should have been told that the cure for affluenza is a solid dose of state-inflicted poverty in a prison cell where Ethan Couch would learn that his money can't buy justice.  In fact the only thing it should  buy  is junk food in the prison commissary -- maybe some Twinkies if any remain on the shelf after all these years.","Texas teenager won't go to jail for drunk driving incident that killed four people .

"(CNN) -- FC Moscow have pulled out of the 2010 Russian Premier Liga after the club's owner withdrew financing of the club. After days of speculation Sports Projects, a subsidiary of the club's owners Norilsk Nickel, confirmed on Friday the company could no longer justify financing the club. The club's future now looks uncertain, with lower league football or even closure a possibility. Meanwhile, Montenegrin coach Miodrag Bozovic, his staff and players are expected to be told to find new employers. ""In my opinion the decision has been taken because, from the point of view of the club's location and name, it does not fit in with the priorities of Norilsk Nickel, the majority of whose workforce are based in Russia's polar regions and the Krasnodar territory,"" Sports Projects general director Leonid Isakovich told reporters. ""Our decision has been influenced by a lack of support from the Moscow authorities. We have made several attempts to find mutual cooperation, but were unable to find an understanding."" The club passed the licensing requirements to compete in the Premier Liga on Thursday, offering a glimmer of hope. But the growing speculation surrounding Norilsk Nickel's continued backing led to a group of fans congregating at the city's Sheremetyevo airport to lobby support from national team coach Guus Hiddink, who was returning to the country to meet new Russian Football Association president Sergei Fursenko. FC Moscow were founded in 1997 under the name Torpedo-ZIL. They finished the 2009 season in sixth place, narrowly missing out on a Europa League spot, and have reached the quarterfinals of the Russian Cup, with ties due to be played in April. Former Russian champions Alania Vladikavkaz, who finished third in Division One, are now expected to take FC Moscow's place in the top flight. FC Moscow may not turn out to be the Premier Liga's only casualty this season. Samara-based side Krylya Sovetov, who are heavily in debt and are reported to owe some of their players wages and bonuses going back to August, have until February 15 to clear their debts and satisfy the licensing requirements for the coming season.

"National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden has written an ""open letter to the people of Brazil"" offering to help investigate U.S. surveillance of Brazilian citizens. The letter was posted on the website pastebin and on the Facebook page of David Michael Miranda, partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald, according to a tweet from Greenwald. In the letter, Snowden says he has told Brazilian lawmakers that he is willing to help investigate ""suspected crimes against Brazilian citizens."" ""I have expressed my willingness to assist wherever appropriate and lawful, but unfortunately the United States government has worked very hard to limit my ability to do so -- going so far as to force down the Presidential Plane of Evo Morales to prevent me from traveling to Latin America! ""Until a country grants permanent political asylum, the U.S. government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak."" Morales challenges U.S. after Snowden rumor holds up plane . The Brazilian government does not plan to respond to Snowden's letter, according to an official in the press office of the Foreign Ministry. At this point, no new request for asylum has been received, so authorities also will have have no comment on speculation surrounding the possibility one could be forthcoming, the official said. An initial request was received in July, but it was a letter sent not by Snowden himself, but by Amnesty International to several countries. Brazil said then that it was not going to respond to the generic letter. Consternation in South America . Brazil has been in an uproar over reports of U.S. spying. In September, Brazilian lawmakers said they planned to send a commission to Russia to speak with Snowden, who had allegedly leaked information about U.S. spying against the country's president. Foreign Minister Luiz Alberto Figueiredo called the situation ""an inadmissible and unacceptable violation of Brazilian sovereignty."" Last month, Brazil acknowledged its own past snooping. The newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo revealed that Brazil spied on foreign diplomats inside Brazil in 2003 and 2004. Its targets included officials from Russia, Iran and the United States. ""I see the situations as completely different,"" Brazilian Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo told the paper. Judge: NSA domestic phone data-mining unconstitutional . In his letter, Snowden, a former NSA contractor, writes, ""Today, if you carry a cell phone in Sao Paolo, the NSA can and does keep track of your location: they do this 5 billion times a day to people around the world. When someone in Florianopolis visits a website, the NSA keeps a record of when it happened and what you did there. If a mother in Porto Alegre calls her son to wish him luck on his university exam, NSA can keep that call log for five years or more. They even keep track of who is having an affair or looking at pornography, in case they need to damage their target's reputation. Opinion: Who really broke the law, Snowden or the government? ""American Senators tell us that Brazil should not worry, because this is not 'surveillance,' it's 'data collection.' They say it is done to keep you safe. They're wrong. There is a huge difference between legal programs, legitimate spying, legitimate law enforcement -- where individuals are targeted based on a reasonable, individualized suspicion -- and these programs of dragnet mass surveillance that put entire populations under an all-seeing eye and save copies forever. These programs were never about terrorism: they're about economic spying, social control, and diplomatic manipulation. They're about power."" Snowden to testify to panel of European Parliament . Snowden has agreed to testify, via teleconference, before a civil liberties committee of the European Parliament, sources in the Parliament say. Some within the Parliament opposed the invitation, but the majority supported the idea, the sources said. The testimony may take place in January, they said. It's unsure whether Snowden would testify live or would be pre-recorded, the sources said, adding that his testimony is expected to cover all aspects of NSA surveillance internationally.

"An interactive map showing the names and addresses of all handgun permit holders in New York's Westchester and Rockland counties has infuriated many readers since it was posted Saturday on a newspaper's website. The map, published by The Journal News, allows readers to zoom in on red dots that indicate which residents are licensed to own pistols or revolvers. It had prompted more than 1,700 comments as of Wednesday morning. Blue dots indicate permit holders who ""have purchased a firearm or updated the information on a permit in the past five years."" ""So should we start wearing yellow Stars of David so the general public can be aware of who we are??"" one commenter wrote. ""This is crazy!"" wrote another. Opinion: Guns endanger more than they protect . Some of those responding threatened to cancel their subscriptions or boycott the publication. ""I hope you lose readers now,"" one wrote. The paper's publisher, Janet Hasson, president of the Journal News Media Group, defended the decision in a statement Wednesday. ""One of our roles is to report publicly available information on timely issues, even when unpopular. We knew publication of the database (as well as the accompanying article providing context) would be controversial, but we felt sharing information about gun permits in our area was important in the aftermath of the Newtown shootings,"" she said. The newspaper also said it had wanted to publish even more information. ""We were surprised when we weren't able to obtain information on what kinds and how many weapons people in our market own,"" the newspaper said in a statement. County clerks' offices had told the paper that ""the public does not have the right to see specific permits an individual has been issued, the types of handguns a person possesses or the number of guns he or she owns,"" the statement said. ""Had we been able to obtain those records, we would have published them."" The map came about in the wake of the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, The Journal News said. ""In the past week, conversation on our opinion pages and on our website, LoHud.com, has been keenly focused on gun control,"" the newspaper's editor and vice president, CynDee Royle, said in a statement Tuesday. The names and addresses of the two counties' permit-holding residents were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The website notes that the map does not indicate whether the residents own handguns, only that they are legally able to, and that the data do not pertain to rifles or shotguns, which can be bought without a permit. NRA doubles down: New gun laws won't work . Still, hundreds of residents were shocked to see their information posted without their being notified. Some said the map would prompt burglaries because thieves are now aware of where weapons might be found. ""Now everyone knows where the legal guns are kept, a valuable piece of information for criminals,"" a commenter wrote. ""Why don't you do something helpful, like trying to find out where the illegal guns are kept?"" A great majority of readers commenting at CNN.com were opposed to the newspaper's move, but some defended it on the grounds that the public has a right to know who might own weapons. One commenter wrote: ""If you're a gun owner it's a matter of public record. If you're embarrassed by your gun, get rid of it. I have a car and a house -- they're no secret. People contact me all the time trying to sell me stuff. I don't expect a right to privacy for these things."" Another wrote, ""Every gun manufactured, transferred, and sold should be on the internet, all on one website, including date of purchase, current owner, stored location, and gun license number."" Several Twitter commenters also came out in support in tweets to CNN: . -- ""The gun permit maps are an effective way of showing how horribly widespread gun ownership is."" -- ""please thank them. This could be a turning point. I do not want my daughter playing in a house with guns."" -- ""LOVE the Gun License map! Excellent information to anyone concerned with who they live around!"" The Journal News argued that residents have a right to access information regarding weapon holders in Westchester and Rockland communities. ""Our readers are understandably interested to know about guns in their neighborhoods,"" Royle said in her statement. In an article about the uproar, The Journal News says many of the thousands of people who ""have taken to their computers and phones in rage"" live outside the counties covered by the map. In searching through hundreds of comments listed on the website, CNN did not immediately see any in support of the newspaper's decision to publish the interactive map. The Journal News said it published an article in 2006 that received similar responses, but this time around, social media spread the story far and wide. In 2007, roanoke.com, the website of The Roanoke Times, published a list of Virginians licensed to carry concealed weapons, and then deleted it the next day.  The paper explained that the list, originally published as part of an opinion column, was removed ""out of concern that it might include names that should not have been made public."" The Poynter Institute, a school for journalists, notes that some other news agencies have published various types of databases as well. ""Publishing gun owners' names makes them targets for theft or public ridicule. It is journalistic arrogance to abuse public record privilege, just as it is to air 911 calls for no reason or to publish the home addresses of police or judges without cause,"" Al Tompkins, a Poynter senior faculty member, said in a statement Wednesday.  ""Unwarranted publishing of the names of permitted owners just encourages gun owners to skip the permitting."" The paper said Royle was not available for interviews Wednesday.

"Eight weeks before the midterm elections, a new CNN/ORC International poll shows that voters in key geographic regions favor Republican candidates heading into November, highlighting significant challenges for Democrats trying to protect half a dozen vulnerable Senate seats and ultimately control of the chamber. Equally concerning for Democrats is that the GOP has a 15-point advantage with independent voters on the generic ballot, and Republicans have an edge at this point in supporter enthusiasm. While Republicans are all but assured of maintaining a healthy majority in the House, the GOP needs a net gain of six seats to control the Senate and its committees that oversee the Obama administration. Should the GOP control Capitol Hill next year, it would be positioned to direct the legislative agenda and influence President Barack Obama's final two years in office. Harman: Time for Obama to turn crisis into opportunity . Because of this, Democrats are desperately trying to protect at least five incumbents in Southern or heavily rural states such as Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, and North Carolina as well as an open seat in Iowa. Most of these races are considered tossups or the GOP has a slight advantage, according to state polling and analysis by independent political handicappers. Meanwhile, there is widespread belief that three other open Democratic seats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia have already been lost to Republicans -- putting the GOP within striking distance of the net gain of six seats needed to take the Senate majority. Lawmakers urge Obama to work with Congress on immigration . Assuming Republicans maintain control of the House — Americans are split over which party should have control of the Senate with 46% supporting a Democratic majority and 42% backing GOP control. It is a different story in the South where a majority of voters, 51%, seek a GOP controlled Senate next year, perhaps making life difficult for Democratic incumbents in Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina. At the same time rural voters also want to see a GOP-controlled Senate by a 48%-37% margin that could have significant implications for Democrats in Alaska and Colorado. 5 key midterm races to watch . Overall, Americans are angry with Capitol Hill, as a whole, with a whopping 83% saying they disapprove of how Congress is handling its job, while 65% describe it as the ""worst Congress of their lifetime."" The current approval rating for Congress is 14%, just four points higher than the all-time low of 10% in a September 2013 CNN/ORC Poll. This might explain why voter enthusiasm has dropped off significantly since the last midterms in 2010 -- particularly among Republicans. Four years ago, 53% of Republicans said they were enthusiastic or very enthusiastic about voting, that number has now dropped to 37%. In 2010, 30% of Democrats were enthusiastic about voting -- fast forward four years and that number has decreased two points. Challenges to predicting the November election result . Despite the drop-off in voter enthusiasm from 2010, the GOP has an advantage in this category, according to the poll. And other data points show that Obama will not be helpful to many of the endangered Democrats seeking re-election. The CNN/ORC poll shows that 52% of registered voters would support a candidate for Congress who opposes Obama, while 39% would support a candidate that backs the president. Democrats are hoping that candidates in Kentucky and Georgia are able take back GOP held seats, which would help the task of keeping the GOP net gain under six seats a lot easier. As for the overall electoral mood for the House, the GOP holds a 49%-45% edge over Democrats in the generic ballot question of which party would you vote for in your congressional district. Terror fears could help GOP in midterms .","Poll reflects significant challenges for Democrats trying to keep Senate majority .

"(CNN)Maj. Mariam Al Mansouri may be ISIS' worst nightmare. The first female fighter pilot in the United Arab Emirates, she led a strike mission this week against the terror group, that country's ambassador to the United States said Thursday. ""She is (a) fully qualified, highly trained, combat ready pilot, and she led the mission,"" Yousef Al Otaiba told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" The UAE has joined the United States and a handful of other Arab nations in conducting airstrikes against ISIS in Syria. This summer, the group declared the establishment of a ""caliphate,"" an Islamic state stretching across the territory it has conquered. It maintains strict rules for women, who are lashed for infractions such as not being fully covered. Al Otaiba said the campaign against ISIS basically boils down to the question of what type of society one wants. ""It's important for us -- moderate Arabs, moderate Muslims -- to step up and say this is a threat against us. This is more of a threat against us than it is against you. This is not just a threat to our countries. This is a threat to our way of life,"" the ambassador told MSNBC. CNN spoke to Al Mansouri earlier this year about her work. She had wanted to be a fighter pilot since she finished high school, but had to wait until women were allowed. ""At that time, the doors were not open for females to be pilots. So I had to wait almost 10 years for the decision to be taken,"" Al Mansouri said. She stressed there's no difference between men and women when it comes to defending their country. ""We are in a hot area so that we have to prepare every citizen,"" Al Mansouri said. ""Of course, everybody is responsible of defending their country -- male or female. When the time will come, everybody will jump in."" Complete coverage on ISIS . CNN's Becky Anderson contributed to this report.","Maj.
