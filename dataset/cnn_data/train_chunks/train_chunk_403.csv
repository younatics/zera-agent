"Jerusalem (CNN)Israel has decided to freeze the transfer of more than $127 million in tax revenues collected on behalf of the Palestinians in the wake of their bid to join the International Criminal Court, Israel's newspaper Haaretz reported Saturday. A Palestine Liberation Organization spokesman said that the freezing of tax revenues is an Israeli decision. ""Palestinians took a legitimate step with the ICC and we are being returned not in kind. They are following our legal step with an illegal one,"" said Xavier Abu Eid, spokesman of the PLO's Negotiations Affairs Department. Israeli authorities couldn't be immediately reached for comment. On Wednesday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas signed a bid to join the International Criminal Court. That move came a day after the U.N. Security Council rejected a resolution calling for Palestinian statehood by 2017, and for Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The bid sets the stage for the Palestinian Authority to possibly pursue war crime complaints against Israel. The U.S. State Department, however, has said it was ""deeply troubled"" by the Palestinian Authority's move, calling it an ""escalatory step."" The State Department said ""direct negotiations are ultimately the only realistic path"" for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The move ""is entirely counterproductive and does nothing to further the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a sovereign and independent state. It badly damages the atmosphere with the very people with whom they ultimately need to make peace,"" the State Department said. CNN's Irene Nasser reported from Jerusalem, and Michael Martinez wrote and reported from Los Angeles.","Israel halts $127 million in tax revenues due to Palestinians, media report says .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama on Sunday accused Sen. Hillary Clinton of echoing the ""bluster"" of President Bush when she said the U.S. would be able to ""obliterate"" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Sen. Barack Obama talks with voters in Elkhart, Indiana, on Sunday, days before the state's primary. ""It's not the language we need right now, and I think it's language reflective of George Bush,"" Obama told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Clinton made the statement about Iran on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday. ""I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran [if it attacked Israel],"" Clinton said. ""In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them."" Not long after Obama weighed in Sunday on Clinton's remark, she was asked if she stood by her statement on ABC's ""This Week."" She stuck with her message, saying warnings of ""massive retaliation"" are needed to keep the Islamic republic in check. Obama and Clinton's sparring comes two days before critical Democratic primaries in Indiana and North Carolina. Obama, addressing Clinton's statement about Iran, said, ""We have had a foreign policy of bluster and saber-rattling and tough talk, and in the meantime have made a series of strategic decisions that have actually strengthened Iran."" Israel is ""the most important ally"" the United States has in the Middle East, and that Washington would respond ""forcefully and appropriately"" to any attack, Obama said Sunday. ""But it is important that we use language that sends a signal to the world community that we're shifting from the sort of cowboy diplomacy, or lack of diplomacy, that we've seen out of George Bush,"" he said. ""And this kind of language is not helpful."" ""When Iran is able to go to the United Nations complaining about the statements made and get some sympathy, that's a sign that we are taking the wrong approach,"" Obama said. The Bush administration has accused Iran of working to obtain nuclear weapons, an allegation officials in Tehran deny. But Iran has ignored U.N. resolutions demanding it halt its uranium enrichment program, insisting its production of nuclear fuel is strictly for peaceful purposes. Speaking on ABC, Clinton said U.S. leaders ""have to be very clear about what we would do"" in case of an Iranian attack on Israel. ""I don't think it's time to equivocate about what we would do,"" she said. ""They have to know that they would face massive retaliation. That is the only way to rein them in."" Israel is widely believed to have its own nuclear arsenal, though it has never joined the ranks of the world's declared nuclear powers. Clinton said she did not believe Iran would attack Israel. ""But I sure want to make it abundantly clear to them that they would face a tremendous cost if they did such a thing,"" she stressed. Obama and Clinton have frequently disagreed over Iran. Obama has said that in his first year as president, he would be willing to meet with the nation's firebrand president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who calls for the end of Israel as a Jewish state. Clinton has said she supports diplomatic engagement -- but not at the presidential level until the Iranian leadership takes certain steps. The two candidates also used Sunday's nearly hourlong interviews -- which, in Clinton's case, included questions from potential voters -- to address other issues dogging their campaigns. Recent comments made by Obama's former pastor Jeremiah Wright, including alleging that AIDS was created by the federal government, made it clear to Obama that Wright ""didn't know me as well as I thought he did, and I certainly didn't know him as well as I thought I did,"" the candidate said. Obama said the experience regarding Wright has been ""disappointing, but something that I had to clearly speak out about."" Obama added that he thinks Wright was after attention. ""It's possible, as a consequence of [Wright] retiring, that having the spotlight was something attractive to him."" He also criticized Clinton's support for a ""gas tax holiday,"" calling it ""a classic Washington gimmick"" that would do little or nothing to help drivers.  Watch Obama and Clinton aggressively woo unions Â» . Clinton said it would alleviate some of the pain at the pump in the short term. ""If we actually did it right, if we had a president who used all the tools of the presidency, we would design it in such a way that it would be implemented effectively,"" she said Sunday. Clinton was being interviewed on ABC by journalist George Stephanopoulos, who was part of her husband's 1992 presidential campaign. ""George and I actually were against NAFTA,"" she said, adding, ""I'm talking about him in his previous life, before he was an objective journalist and didn't have opinions about such matters."" He then suggested she is having it ""both ways"" by claiming credit for NAFTA's successes while not taking ""blame for the bad."" ""I have said very clearly that I am going to renegotiate NAFTA and I will fix NAFTA,"" Clinton responded. When Republicans took control of Congress in 1995, she said, ""they had a different set of priorities than the Clinton administration did."" Stephanopoulos also asked Clinton to respond to conservative radio star Rush Limbaugh's calls for Republicans to vote for Clinton as a way of keeping Democrats divided. ""He's always had a crush on me,"" she joked, triggering laughter throughout the room.

"Happy birthday, Gloria Steinem! The ""Face of Feminism"" turns 80 Tuesday, and guess what? Feminism seems to be turning the corner -- again. Many young women are now embracing the term and rejecting the notion that feminists are hairy, ugly, man-hating, angry women. Heck, even Beyonce appeared on the cover of Steinem's magazine, Ms., last year. And lest critics point to Beyonce's overt sexuality as evidence of her hypocrisy, this year Queen Bey took it a step further and wrote an essay for ""The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Pushes Back from the Brink."" In it, Beyonce Knowles-Carter (note the hyphenated name!) proclaimed that ""gender equality is a myth!"" She went on to write, ""the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes. But unless women and men both say this is unacceptable, things will not change."" A few years ago, Emma Watson told People magazine of her ""Harry Potter"" character, ""Hermione's not scared to be clever. I think sometimes really smart girls dumb themselves down a bit, and that's bad."" Watson added she's a lot like Hermione: ""I'm a bit of a feminist. I'm very competitive and challenging."" That's not to say all young women feel the same. Or certain older men. 5 reasons why we love Gloria Steinem . Rush Limbaugh perverts the word ""feminist"" all the time. He likes to call his targets ""feminist extremists"" and ""feminazis."" In 2012, Limbaugh took on Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke. She testified before Congress about the need for her Jesuit university to provide contraception insurance coverage for female students. She even admitted to being an ""American woman who uses contraceptives."" Oh, my! Limbaugh promptly labeled her a ""feminazi"" and a ""slut."" Or to quote the big man himself, ""So, Ms. Fluke and the rest of you feminazis, here's the deal. If we are going to pay for your contraceptives, and thus pay for you to have sex, we want something for it, and I'll tell you what it is. We want you to post the videos online so we can all watch."" It so evokes Bobby Riggs, right? A pro tennis player who, on September 20, 1973, challenged Billie Jean King to a tennis match because ""the best way to handle women is to keep them barefoot and pregnant."" Happy 80th, Gloria Steinem . Courtney Martin, who co-edited Feministing.com -- a widely read and influential feminist blog -- and author of ""Perfect Girls, Starving Daughters,"" says  many young women have been afraid of the word ""feminist"" because it's been the target of a powerful smear campaign for decades. But, thanks largely to the Internet, smears like Limbaugh's are losing their power. At Feministing.com, she says, ""we get mail from teenaged girls in the middle of Iowa who say ... 'I stumbled on your site and realized feminism isn't about man-hating and  Birkenstocks.' "" It's actually ""kind of cool and counter-cultural."" Wow. Really? Martin says yes. Because today's feminist movement realized it had to embrace aesthetics. Beauty and fun and relationships matter, too. So does the cool factor.  Jon Stewart, anyone? Stewart has a cultural agenda, he's cool, and young people follow him in droves. Jessica Valenti, an author sometimes described as a feminist evangelist, says that when she delivered talks on feminism on college campuses a few years ago, one or two hands went up when she asked who considered themselves a feminist. Today, she says, ""now almost all of them do."" And, says Martin, it's not just because of ""cool"" or contraception or abortion rights. It's because of a more evolved definition of feminism. ""Feminism means a fight for others,"" Martin said. It's about living a ""feminist life."" That means equality for everyone: women, children and, yes, men. That includes advocating on issues like immigration, human trafficking and so much more. Perhaps Lena Chen, an activist and media commentator for Salon, Glamour and her own blog, put it best. ""In my lifetime feminism has evolved far beyond the binary identity politics of women vs. men,"" she wrote in an e-mail. ""To me, feminism is one part of a larger global movement for liberation.  Gender norms dictating how you ought to behave, dress, marry, or work are oppressive regardless of what body you inhabit or how you identify yourself."" She says social media have helped many young activists in her generation speak with powerful voices. They no longer need one ""figurehead"" in ""order to create change."" They just need each other. So, happy birthday, Gloria. On your 80th birthday, feminism has indeed turned a corner. We'll have to see how far it has gone when you turn 90. Or 100.","The face of feminism, Gloria Steinem, turns 80 on Tuesday .

"Sheryl Sandberg's ""Lean In"" venture is being rightly attacked for all the wrong reasons. She's been drubbed for being too privileged and too powerful. What could a Harvard MBA who hopped from the World Bank to Google to Facebook's COO know about the lives of ""real"" women? So much of the flap -- pro and con -- over Sandberg's attempt to jump-start a women's revolution has less to do with the attempt than with resentment over her class status. Her antagonists can't get two sentences into their critique without invoking her net worth and the square footage of her house ($500 million and 9,000, respectively). And her proponents can't get two sentences into their defense without telling us how marvelous she was at that tete-a-tete at that five-star restaurant or that world power brokers' summit that they had the good fortune to attend. Economic envy is the skunk at Sandberg's book release party. We hate her for being so anointed, or we love her because we were deemed anointed enough to rub shoulders with her at some post-TED-talk party -- ""we"" being the comfortable middle-to-upper class women fueling this media debate. Either way, what's been missed is a real opportunity that Sandberg's proposal unintentionally spotlights: the opportunity to talk honestly about feminism and class. The unmentionable issue of class . Americans are notoriously averse to discussing class. We want to believe the prime barrier to socioeconomic advancement is ourselves. Sandberg believes that, too. ""We can reignite the revolution by internalizing the revolution,"" she writes in ""Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead."" All we need to do is ""lean in"" to our ambitions, and up, up and away we go. The handpicked positive stories posted on the Lean In website all attest to the same ethos: ""You are the boss of you,"" writes Beth Comstock, ""CMO, G.E."" Or, as Reese Witherspoon, ""Actress & Global Ambassador,"" puts it: ""Just jump!"" What we need to do, Sandberg tells us in her book, is jettison our fears: ""Fear of overreaching. Fear of being judged. ...  And the holy trinity of fear: the fear of being a bad mother/wife/daughter."" In this feminist-sounding riff on ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,"" the only fear not raised is the one FDR was addressing: economic. It's remarkable oversight in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. But Sandberg isn't alone in her silence. Mainstream feminist debate, for all the lip service paid to the ""intersectionality"" of race, class and gender, has also left economic divisions on the cutting-room floor. It's more marketable to talk about sex or pop culture. The recoil from class issues came early, when American feminism began retreating from its examination of root causes. In a 1972 article in the feminist newspaper, The Furies, Coletta Reid observed: ""Early in the women's liberation movement, I saw class as an issue that men in the Left used to put down feminism. Later it became an issue that many women said we had to discuss,"" but never seriously did. And yet, we won't ever productively confront women's secondary status without confronting class. Our economic framework is founded on women's subjugation. The power structure that Sandberg wants to feminize was built to cement the power of (some) men, and on the backs of (most) women, who would not only stay out of the power suites but would make all the power plays possible by assuming every backstage duty, from minding the kids to handling the least glamorous and lowest-paid work. It's in capitalism's DNA, and no cosmetic paste-ons at the top are going to change the dynamic without significant change on the bottom. Charlotte Bunch, whose sane voice on so many feminist questions deserves more notice, limned that connection years ago in her essay, ""Class and Feminism."" ""Class distinctions are an outgrowth of male domination,"" she wrote, ""a political mechanism for maintaining not only capitalism but also patriarchy and white supremacy."" You can't change the world for women by simply inserting female faces at the top of an unchanged system of social and economic power. ""You can't,"" to quote Bunch again, ""just add women and stir."" Could Sandberg's book have launched such a necessary discussion? Well, actually, yes, if you skip the many pages devoted to variations on her exhortation to ""have the ambition to lean in to your career and run the world,"" and linger instead on one sentence that should be at the forefront of such a conversation: ""The number of women supporting families on their own is increasing quickly; between 1973 and 2006, the proportion of families headed by a single mother grew from one in 10 to one in five."" Breadwinners and barely staying afloat . Since 2000, as many households depend on a single mother as the breadwinner as depend on a traditional male breadwinner. One fourth of mothers are single, and at least half of children will spend some time in a single-mother home. In short, single mothers are now a huge demographic and a potential force for change. And they're a subjugated majority. Most single mothers operate under extreme social and economic impediments -- triple the poverty rate of the rest of the population, the highest rate of low-wage employment, the worst wage gap, the lowest net worth, the highest risk of bankruptcy -- that add up to a massive inequality in American society. And this isn't because of a lack of lean-in self-confidence. The U.S. provides the worst support structure for single parents of any economically comparable nation, a recent major study by Legal Momentum found. And it's only getting worse, as politicians aim to slash welfare programs, enforcement of child support, child tax credits and anything else they can think to deny single mothers, as they blame them for all that's wrong with society. Nor is their plight because of a lack of lean-in commitment. The study found that American single mothers work more hours than single mothers in any developed nation. And many of them work for subsistence wages for the same companies that have signed up to sponsor Sandberg's Lean In campaign for executive equality. Wal-Mart, a Lean In ""partner,"" is facing sex discrimination claims from 2,000 female employees in 48 states. Sandberg's book mentions single mothers in passing. But what if she were to champion them? What if the Lean In community or any group of feminist-minded women were to organize around the cause of single motherhood instead of the cause of their own self-congratulation? It would involve, first of all, a change in Sandberg's rules. Testimonials on her Lean In website must be inspirational, not troubling: ""Share a positive ending,"" its story guidelines instruct. The flip side of the view that women can do anything if they ""just jump"" is the assumption that anyone who doesn't should remain invisible. That message is the precise opposite of feminism. Consider instead the benefits of a campaign that bore down on the causes behind the negative endings that mar so many single mothers' lives. It would not only be confronting a problem that affects huge numbers of women, it would be mounting a significant challenge to a system that will otherwise continue to stand between women and full emancipation. Because what does a single mother signify? She is an adult woman with responsibilities who is not supported by a man. Symbolically, she stands for the possibility of women to truly remake the patriarchal structure. That would require a movement built not around corporate bromides, but a collective grassroots effort to demand the fundamental social change necessary to grant independent mothers a genuine independence. Single mothers can only be insulted by the advice to ""lean in"" -- they couldn't lean out if they wanted. And any brand of feminism that leaves them out is a faux liberation. Liberating single mothers requires more than showing other women of privilege how they can be queen of the system. It means following the advice of Charlotte Bunch, and changing -- even destroying -- the system that the Lean In women are so happy and eager to run.","Susan Faludi: Sheryl Sandberg's detractors and supporters focus on her class .

"New York (CNN)The ceremonial burning of paper money and the melodic sounds of Buddhist chants are marking a weekend of remembrance for the second police officer killed in an ambush by a lone gunman in December -- a sendoff that reflects the changing face of a department once known for its deep Irish and Italian roots. Under a mix of rain and snow, Det. Wenjian Liu was remembered Saturday at Aievoli Funeral Home in Brooklyn, where Mayor Bill de Blasio, Police Commissioner William Bratton, local officials and throngs of uniformed police officers and firefighters gathered at his wake in a sign of the diversity and unity of the nation's largest city. Liu was 12 when his parents emigrated with him in 1994, coming to the United States from Canton, China. His police partner, Rafael Ramos, a New York native of Puerto Rican descent, was remembered last week with a massive outpouring at a Protestant church in Queens. With the city and nation divided over the treatment of minorities by their brothers and sisters on the force, the lives of the two fallen officers more closely reflected the city's diversity. On Sunday, a sea of dark blue drawn from the police forces of New York and beyond is expected to find its way to the funeral home for Liu's funeral at 11 a.m. ET. When his NYPD colleagues gather there, their boss has an urgent request of them: Please remain reverent throughout the services. Don't carry out an ""act of disrespect"" against anyone, Police Commissioner William Bratton said in a memorandum obtained by CNN. Turning their backs . The message was directed at a large group that attended the funeral for Ramos last week and turned their backs on de Blasio as he gave his eulogy.  On Saturday, several officers saluted de Blasio when he arrived at the funeral home. It was a repeat protest. They had done it before, the night after the two men were shot dead in their car, when de Blasio entered the hospital to condemn the killing. Some officers accused the mayor of encouraging anti-police fervor due to his support of protests against police brutality. Tens of thousands had taken to the streets in the wake of the death of African-American man Eric Garner during an encounter with white officers. Pat Lynch, head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, has taken aim at de Blasio, even saying the mayor's office was stained with the officers' blood. He has called for searing protest by police officers, and some have heeded that call. But for Sunday's funeral, Bratton is putting his foot down at a potential repeat by some officers. 'Grieving, not grievance' ""A hero's funeral is about grieving, not grievance,"" Bratton said. The last display put all NYPD officers in a bad light, he said. ""It stole the valor, honor and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of detective Rafael Ramos's life and sacrifice,"" his memo read. But he commiserated with the sentiments of many officers. ""As a cop, one who lived and worked through the assassination threats of the 1970s, I understand that emotions are high,"" he said. Still the message was clear: Respect the fallen; honor of the uniform. He expressly said there'd be no punishment for noncompliance at Liu's funeral but made sure the request was heard by all. His memo was to be read or displayed at police roll calls through Sunday. The ambush . Ramos and Liu were sitting in their squad car in Brooklyn when Ismaaiyl Brinsley ambushed them with a gun December 20. He shot himself to death in a nearby subway station. Brinsley had a lengthy rap sheet that included gun crimes. Before killing the two men, he had tweeted messages that he would kill police officers in the wake of the deaths of Garner and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Bratton promoted Liu and Ramos to the rank of detective first grade during Ramos' funeral, to rousing applause. Wenjian Liu . Liu's family came to the United States from Canton, China, in search of a better life. He majored in accounting in college, but he opted for a different path, joining the New York Police Department in 2007. He was proud to serve as an officer, his family said, using his Chinese-language skills whenever they were needed. He got married in September and had been looking forward to having his own family. Liu's family described him as selfless and kind in an interview given to the New York Daily News. Holding back tears, his father said that as a young officer, Liu once bought a meal for someone he pulled over before guiding him home, he told the Daily News. Liu's funeral comes five days after his partner's. His family was waiting for family to come from China. His widow gave a brief statement on the day of Ramos' funeral, thanking members of the community for their support and sending condolences to the Ramos family. ""This is a difficult time for both of our families,"" Pei Xia Chen said, ""but we will stand together and get through this together."" Rafael Ramos . Ramos saw his work as a police officer as a ministry and was posthumously appointed honorary NYPD chaplain. He was just hours away from becoming a lay chaplain and graduating from a community-crisis chaplaincy program before his violent death. He left behind a wife, Maritza, and two sons, Justin and Jaden. Vice President Joe Biden, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, de Blasio and Bratton delivered eulogies at his funeral. More than 25,000 police officers from across the country and Canada attended. Officers formed long chains holding hands in prayer. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Fellow officers to say goodbye to Det.

"In a closely watched vote, Uruguayan lawmakers approved a proposal to make recreational marijuana legal for adults and to regulate its  production, distribution and sale. Once it's signed by President Jose Mujica, who initiated the proposal, Uruguay will be the first nation in the world to fully legalize the drug. In the year and a half since President Mujica announced the proposal in June 2012 as part of a comprehensive package aimed at fighting crime and public insecurity, a strong coalition of LGBT, women's rights, health, student, environmental and human rights organizations joined forces with trade unions, doctors, musicians, lawyers, athletes, writers, actors and academics under the banner of Regulacion Responsable (Responsible Regulation) to support the initiative and created a lively public campaign in favor of the proposal. Under the proposal, people will have four ways to access marijuana: medical marijuana through the Ministry of Public Health, domestic cultivation of up to six plants, membership clubs similar to those found in Spain and licensed sale to adults in pharmacies.  The bill was approved in the Chamber of Deputies in late July and passed in the Chamber of Senators on Tuesday. Why marijuana, why now and why Uruguay? The following three simple reasons have a lot to do with today's outcome: . Because it's the smart thing to do. Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is insanity, and Uruguay knows this. For 40 years, marijuana prohibition simply hasn't worked. Billions of dollars have been spent on repression, but marijuana use has only gone up -- along with the number of lives lost to failed policies. The tens of thousands who have died in Mexico's drug war -- estimates in 2012  ranged from 60,000 to 70,000 over six years -- Central America's globally high homicide rates and the United States' racially driven mass incarceration are but a few examples of the human cost of the war on drugs. But rather than closing their eyes to the continuing problem of drug abuse and drug trafficking, Uruguay's leaders have chosen responsible regulation of an existing reality. Because the winds are changing, and they're starting to blow in that direction. In recent years, debate and political will for an overhaul in drug policy has gained unprecedented momentum throughout the U.S., Latin America and elsewhere. In 2011, Kofi Annan, Paul Volcker and Richard Branson joined former Presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil,  Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico  and other distinguished members of the Global Commission on Drug Policy in saying the time had come to ""break the taboo"" on exploring alternatives to the failed war on drugs and to ""encourage experimentation by governments with models of legal regulation of drugs,"" especially marijuana. More recently, Presidents Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia and Otto Perez Molina in Guatemala have joined these calls for reform. In May, the Organization of American States produced a report, commissioned by heads of state of the region, that included marijuana legalization as a likely policy alternative for the coming years. In November 2012, the states of Colorado and Washington approved the legal regulation of marijuana.  In August, the White House announced that the federal government will not interfere with state marijuana laws -- as long as a number of stipulations are adhered to, such as preventing distribution to minors. By approving this measure, Uruguay has taken the broad regional discussion on alternatives to drug prohibition one step further, representing a concrete advance in line with growing anti-drug war rhetoric in Latin America and throughout the world. Because Uruguay is used to doing exceptional things. You might hear ""Uruguay"" and think of football, yerba mate, beef, tango or, now, marijuana. But this tiny country of just over 3 million people has a history of remarkable political reforms and a strong human rights ethos. Just last year, Uruguay legalized same-sex marriage and abortion. It has long been at the forefront of progressive policies, being one of the first nations in the region to grant divorce rights for women in 1912, instituting the eight-hour workday in 1915 and including women's right to vote in its Constitution in 1917. It has never criminalized prostitution and has legally regulated it since 2002. In 2009, Uruguay granted adoption rights for same-sex couples and the legal right to choose one's own gender identity. This also comes from a country where the church and state have been officially separated since 1917. It's a country where the president, 78-year-old former Tupamaro guerrilla Mujica, lives an austere lifestyle after having spent 14 years as a political prisoner during Uruguay's dictatorship, 10 of them in solitary confinement. He donates 90% of his salary to charity, shuns the presidential palace and chooses instead to remain on his farm with his wife, also a former political prisoner, working to construct a more fair, more inclusive Uruguay. The consensus is there. Marijuana prohibition hasn't worked, and it's time to try an innovative, more compassionate and smarter approach. Let's hope more countries soon follow Uruguay's brave lead.

You might win enough to cover your tab or your order at Lucy's Fried Chicken on the same block. Celebrate like the Basques, Boise, Idaho . One of the largest Basque festivals in the world, Jaialdi 2015 celebrates Idaho's Basque community, a distinct culture tracing its roots back 2,000 years to northern Spain's Basque autonomous region. The dancing and games (including jai alai) that are central to Basque life will be on display during the July 28-August 2 festival, pegged to the community's celebration of San Ignacio of Loyola, its patron saint. If you can't make the every-five-years festival, stop by Boise's ""Basque Block"" anytime to eat, drink and learn more about Basque culture. Salt of the earth, Malden, West Virginia . Chef Nancy Bruns' relationship with salt runs deep. Her family's salt business goes back seven generations to the early 1800s, when Bruns' great, great, great, great-grandfather William Dickinson came to the Malden area. He made a life from the salt in the natural brine springs bubbling up from an ancient ocean underneath the Appalachian Mountains. The family dug wells to reach richer, heavier brine buried in the earth. The family stopped harvesting salt in 1945, but Bruns and her brother Lewis Payne relaunched the business in 2013 with an emphasis on local, sustainable food and business practices. Tours of J.Q.

Even if you can't make the annual celebration of truckers, you can buy big rig lights and fenders amid the aisles of chrome in the Super Truck Showroom, get your teeth fixed at the dentist and catch a movie at the truck stop theater. An 18-wheeler named ""America the Beautiful"" welcomes truckers to the stop. On its side is a landscape painting featuring famous sites along I-80, America's ""Main Street."" (The actual highway stretches about 3,000 miles from New York to San Francisco.) You can also learn about big rigs of old at the Iowa 80 Trucking Museum. This land is our land, Tulsa, Oklahoma . The return of great American folk singer Woody Guthrie's archives to Oklahoma -- and the opening of a museum dedicated to his legacy -- is a huge boon for his home state. The Woody Guthrie Center houses instruments, drawings and writings by the late performer and many he inspired, including Pete Seeger and Tom Morello. The archive vault of the ""This Land is Your Land"" singer holds stacks of notebooks of unpublished songs and poems available for research purposes. The center is the cornerstone of Tulsa's revitalized Brady Arts District, sharing a repurposed paper plant with a contemporary art gallery, an arts education center and a Philbrook Museum of Art satellite location.

Calling all ducks, Stuttgart, Arkansas . Hear that quacking sound? It may not be a duck. Head toward the 80th annual Wings Over the Prairie Festival and World Championship Duck Calling Contest in Stuttgart during Thanksgiving week to hear the best of the best. Imitating a duck doesn't always come easy: Many hunters use duck calls, made like musical instruments, to lure flying ducks closer to them during a hunt. Hunters must learn many different calls depending on the moods and flight patterns of the ducks crossing overhead. Every five years, there is a Champion of Champions duck-calling contest that is open only to the former world champions, and that faceoff will take place in 2015.  Also a part of the activities is the 35th annual World Championship Duck Gumbo Cookoff. A pile of dough, Skowhegan, Maine . If you love good bread -- the hand-baked variety, not the store-bought stuff -- you'll flip for the three-day Kneading Conference and Artisan Bread Fair in the picturesque town of Skowhegan on the Kennebec River. The conference portion of this three-day celebration of dough features workshops on such bread-geek topics as building brick ovens and the benefits of milling whole grains with strange names like einkorn and spelt. It's followed by a fair where vendors sell baked goods of every variety, from crusty rosemary boules to flatbreads to artisanal donuts. You can watch demonstrations of scything and wood-fired pizza baking, and even try your hand (foot?) at milling flour by pedaling a bicycle. The conference takes place July 30 and 31, followed by the bread fair on August 1. Running after Rocky, Philadelphia . You may want to run up Rocky's 72 steps before they're modified. Star architect Frank Gehry's plans for the modernization of the Philadelphia Museum of Art would cut into the iconic steps to create an entrance and light for the museum's new lower level galleries. Sigh. It's supposed to take at least a decade, and the museum needs to raise $350 million for the project, so you have time for more than a couple of sprints.

"(CNN)  -- When a young mother named Marguerite Elisofon first contacted Dr. Stanley Greenspan, her baby daughter was interested in almost nothing. Samantha just stared into space. She was, said her mother, ""in a distant land."" Elisofon remembers thinking that maybe Greenspan ""could be our Magellan and give us a road map to follow with new and better games to help our daughter catch up and be like other toddlers."" Stanley Greenspan, child psychiatrist, spent 30 years exploring the emotional lives of children. The creator of an original approach to teaching and parenting children with autism died last Tuesday at the age of 68. Greenspan called his method ""floor time."" The process, he said, begins by ""entering a child's world ... and bringing the child into a shared world."" ""Then,"" said Dr. Greenspan, ""we get cooking."" What Dr. Greenspan means by ""cooking"" can be seen on this video. A mother and father are trying hard to connect with their 3-year-old son, Alex, to no avail. The fire is lit at one minute and 51 seconds into the video. Alex makes a sound. Not a word. Just a sound. ""Eeh."" From his vantage point -- on the floor of his office -- Stanley Greenspan seizes that ""Eeh"" to steer Alex's parents into their little boy's world, in much the same way that he guided the Elisofons into Samantha's world at the beginning of an 18-year journey that Samantha's mother recalls. In an interview with CNN last summer, Greenspan was ailing and in pain. But his passion was intact. ""Each and every week when I see patients, I learn something new,"" he said. Children were Greenspan's teachers. Parents too. ""I still am amazed at gifted parents and what they teach me in my practice,"" he said. One thing that makes his approach to autism, and parenting in general, so distinctive, is that he treated what appeared to be strange behaviors as windows of opportunity -- as new paths to distant lands. Watching Greenspan recount for CNN the story of an autistic boy he'd seen a few days earlier reveals something beyond parenting though -- when you're passionate about your work, you can be ailing and cooking at the same time.","Creator of an original approach to teaching children with autism died last Tuesday .

"(CNN)West Indies batsman Chris Gayle has scored the first double hundred in Cricket World Cup history. The big hitter reached his double century off just 138 balls in a Pool B match as the West Indies defeated Zimbabwe by 77 runs in Canberra, Australia. Gayle's knock of 215 off 147 balls beats the previous best by South Africa's Gary Kirsten, who scored 188 not out against the United Arab Emirates at the 1996 World Cup. The 35-year-old left-hander -- the only batsman to hit a century in Twenty20 Internationals -- blasted 16 sixes and 10 fours during his innings as the Windies finished on 372 for two off 50 overs. ""It was slow at the start, but you have to take the bull by its horns and try to put some pressure on them,"" Gayle said, BBC Sport reported. ""Eventually the field spread and I targeted which balls to attack. When I got past one hundred, I knew I wanted it to be a double hundred, so I'm glad I got the chance to deliver it."" The Jamaican made a shaky start surviving a close LBW decision off the first ball of the match before eventually losing his wicket to the final ball of the innings. ""With the innings, I struggled at the start and it was scary the first ball. I was like 'come on you're not serious, I can't be out on this first ball'. I needed a chance and got a break and made the best use of it."" West Indies, two-time winners of the Cricket World Cup, recorded a shock loss against minnows Ireland in their first group game but bounced back with a win against 1992 champions Pakistan in their second pool match.","West Indies' Chris Gayle broke cricket World Cup records by hitting a double century in a match against Zimbabwe .

"A Pennsylvania judge is expected to rule Tuesday whether or not to uphold a new state law requiring every voter to present a photo ID at the polls. Supporters argue that the law signed in March by Republican Gov. Tom Corbett will prevent voter fraud and is upheld by the constitution.  But opponents counter that the new law will disenfranchise voters, and any implementation should be postponed until after the November 6 presidential election. The state Supreme Court has given Commonwealth Court Judge Robert Simpson, Jr., until Tuesday -- five weeks before the election  -- to decide on the matter. Here's a overview of what's at stake: . What exactly is the lower court judge ruling on? Judge Simpson is not ruling on whether the law is constitutional -- that's up to the state supreme court.  He has been tasked by the state's high court to determine whether people across the state have equal access to photo IDs in time for the November 6 election. If he finds that they do not, the court is obligated to enter a preliminary injunction -- in other words, temporarily halt the law -- until after the upcoming presidential election to prevent voter disenfranchisement. Whatever he decides, it's highly likely that the other side will once again appeal his ruling. So, if the law is upheld, what will change for Pennsylvania's voters in November? Prior to this law, first-time voters in Pennsylvania were allowed to present documents such as bank statements and utility bills in lieu of photo identification. If the law is upheld, all voters will have to present a valid photo ID -- one that is sanctioned by the state -- before they cast their ballots. One thing that won't change: Pennsylvania voters must be registered by October 9 to cast a ballot in the November 6 general election. What kind of IDs are allowed under the law? And just how hard is it to get one? Under the law, voters need to present one of the following at their precinct: . * A Pennsylvania driver's license . * A state ID issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) * A U.S. passport . * An active duty or retired U.S. military ID . * A military dependent's ID . * A state employee ID issued by the federal, state, county or municipal government . * A school ID issued by an accredited Pennsylvania university, college, seminary, community college or two-year college to students, faculty, employees and alumni. * An ID issued by a Pennsylvania care facility . To get a photo ID, residents must have a valid Social Security card; an official birth certificate or U.S. citizenship documents; and two proofs of residency, such as a utility bill or tax records. (The state has more details for residents on its website). Is this just partisan politics at play? Pennsylvania is a likely swing state in the upcoming presidential elections, and that means any attempt to change the voting mechanisms this close to the election is bound to trigger accusations of partisan politics. Gov. Corbett said the law ""sets a simple and clear standard to protect the integrity of our elections."" While the law protects only against voter impersonation -- and lawyers on both sides admit there are no known cases of in-person fraud -- it still has a broader impact, according to conservative columnist John Fund. ""If someone walks in and votes in the name of the dead person (and) they don't have to show ID, how likely is that dead person to complain? We'll never know. And unless they confess, the crime is perfect,"" Fund said. But critics say it's just an attempt by Republicans -- who overwhelmingly support the measure -- to gain an upper hand in a close election. ""Given that the vast majority of people who are impacted by this law are poor, are uneducated, or of color, or live in cities, i.e. Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, (and) are likely to vote Democratic, this law could have an impact on the presidential election,""  said Vic Walczak, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania. That position was bolstered when the state's House GOP leader Mike Turzai told a group of fellow Republicans in June that the measure would ""allow Governor Romney to win the State of Pennsylvania."" Turzai's office has since said the legislator was commenting on the issue of voter fraud. Why is this issue still being debated so close to the presidential election? The issue actually started eight months before the elections when Corbett signed the law in March.  After that, civil rights organizations and attorneys filed a lawsuit in May to overturn the law.  That eventually made its way to the state Supreme Court which sent the dispute back down to Simpson in Commonwealth Court, who upheld the law in August. Sisters navigate new voter ID law . Last month, the state Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of Simpson's decision, then sent the case back to Simpson for additional review, with a court-imposed deadline of October 2 for a final ruling.","A Pennsylvania judge has until Tuesday to rule on state's voter ID law .

"China's State Council recently handed down an ""authoritative White Paper"" on the ""one country, two systems"" model as applied to Hong Kong. Deng Xiaoping, a reformist leader and the man who launched China toward becoming the world's largest economy, invented the idea originally for Taiwan, but events transpired to make Hong Kong the test bed. That tiny test bed is currently turning into a big headache for China's leaders as 787,767 Hong Kongers voted last week in an unauthorized referendum for what they consider acceptable models of democratically nominating and electing their chief executive -- the city's top politician -- in 2017. At present, Hong Kong's chief executive -- currently Leung Chun-ying -- is selected by a 1,200-member election committee with the approval of Beijing. Many are voting more against the White Paper, which maintained China's ""comprehensive jurisdiction"" over the city, than for one of the models. They, and nearly the entire legal profession in Hong Kong, object to the paper calling judges ""administrators"" who must take orders from Beijing. Hong Kong follows the British-derived common law system. The rule of law, insured by judges independent of the administration is, according to nearly everyone, the key distinguisher between the legal system in Hong Kong and that holding sway on the mainland. Autonomy unchallenged until now . At the core of ""one country, two systems"" is just how autonomous the smaller system can be against the larger, dominant one.  And one thing most dependent on that ""high degree of autonomy"" Deng promised is the rule of law. This autonomy has been largely unchallenged since 1997, when Britain handed over the city to China. But today the issue of just how democratic Beijing will permit the election of the next chief executive to be has brought the whole concept of genuine autonomy into doubt. Deng and his successors have repeatedly told Taiwan -- which China considers to be a renegade province -- under this concept that it could keep its army, currency and separate political system, just as long as it stuck to there being ""one China."" But the White Paper on the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region spells out a very different version of autonomy, one that's closer in terms of central control to the iron fist actually practiced in the Tibet Special Administrative Region rather than the velvety promises being given to Taiwan. Hong Kongers are up in arms over this -- so far -- typographic crackdown on autonomy.  But the Taiwanese are also not amused. And here's why this drama matters outside China. China has shown first with Japan over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands and now with Vietnam, that it takes its claims to the whole South China Sea (which includes Taiwan) seriously. China is very sensitive about any hint of separatist or secessionist activity. Beijing may not see the difference between their concerns for state security and unification, and the local actions in Hong Kong that actually have nothing to do with secession from China. There are a lot of missiles, ships, submarines, fighters and troops faced off across the strait between Taiwan and the mainland. ""One country, two systems"" is supposedly the peaceful alternative to war for reunification with Taiwan. If Hong Kong shows ""one country, two systems"" was a promise given by Beijing with no intent to keep its treaty-given word, Taiwan is very unlikely to agree to reunify with mainland China under those terms. Even an international treaty supposedly protecting Taiwan's ""high degree of autonomy"" would little persuade if there's a Hong Kong crackdown with no international reaction. Nobody knows what the replacement for ""one country, two systems"" should be. China is increasingly throwing its weight around, facing off with Vietnam, the Philippines and the United States. Hong Kong is part of this larger context of China becoming aggressive and assertive -- and if it's willing to take on all these nations at the same time, it's not going to let a few hundred thousand people intimidate it. Beijing promises . Another reason it matters becomes clear in the paper's timing, just before last week's ""people's referendum"" on political reform. In 2007, Beijing promised Hong Kong could elect its chief executive by universal suffrage in 2017. Since it already directly elects over half its legislature, Hong Kong is well ahead of the rest of China in political reform. Hong Kong has long led the way to both economic and political change in China. The village election system Deng started in 1982 was directly modeled on Hong Kong village elections, and recent elections of District Boards in a number of mainland cities drew once more on Hong Kong's own invention of District Boards in 1982. If China is going to start making a transition from authoritarian dictatorship to something closer to democracy, the Hong Kong test bed is the place to start. Stopping reform in Hong Kong very likely means killing it in the rest of China. This matters to the rest of world because democracies have dominated the globe economically and politically for over a century.  But now, with China soon taking the top spot economically, will democratic habits of discussion, voting and compromise collide with an elite more accustomed to giving orders that are obeyed? That's what makes the White Paper on Hong Kong so important, and so worrying.  Not only does it take a rather imperious tone; it was issued in seven languages, so much as stating to the rest of world: ""pay attention, what we do in Hong Kong is our business and no one else's, whatever an international treaty like the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration might say."" Japan, with treaty claims to the Diaoyu/Senkkaku Islands; Vietnam, already in dispute with China; and the United States, which claims the South China Sea is international waters, according to treaty, take note.","""One country, two systems"" promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy under Chinese rule .

"(CNN) -- A major snowstorm slammed the East Coast and snarled the busy holiday travel season Saturday as airports shut down runways, rail service slowed and bus routes were suspended on the last weekend before Christmas. Record snowfall totals were reported Saturday afternoon at Washington Dulles and Reagan National airports -- and snow was still falling. Accumulation at Dulles reached 16 inches, breaking the old record of 10.6 inches set December, 12, 1964; 13.3 inches was reported at Reagan. The old record there was 11.5 inches set December 17, 1932. Three deaths in Virginia were blamed on the storm, state officials said. One person was killed late Friday in a single-car crash. Two other deaths were reported Saturday as more heavy snow was expected. Virginia Gov. Timothy Kaine authorized up to 1,000 National Guardsmen to assist in responding to the storm, which dumped more than 20 inches of snow in parts of the state by Saturday evening. Virginia State Police had responded to nearly 3,000 accidents or disabled vehicles since Friday night, the governor's office said. The storm stretched from Tennessee and North Carolina to the southern New England states, blanketing the mid-Atlantic region and the heavily populated I-95 corridor. The forecast called for 12 to 22 inches of snow in some areas. See current flight delay information on the FAA Web site . CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said the storm -- known as a nor'easter -- could rival the Knickerbocker blizzard of 1922, which dropped between 28 and 33 inches of snow in the D.C. area. ""I don't know that it will be a record-breaker, but this is significant,"" she said. ""This is a really bad storm right now."" The foul weather prompted an emergency declaration in the nation's capital, stranded hundreds of motorists, shut down airports, caused power outages, and threatened to keep hordes of Christmas shoppers indoors. The weather delayed start times for two National Football League games Sunday. The Chicago Bears-Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers-Philadelphia Eagles games will be played at 4:15 p.m. instead of 1 p.m. Chicago Bears players and staff were scheduled to arrive in Baltimore via a charter late Saturday night, after a single runway was opened at BWI-Thurgood Marshall Airport. That runway is expected to remain open for all flights, a spokesman for the Maryland Aviation Airport Authority said. A winter storm warning was in effect for the Washington area until 6 a.m. Sunday. Blizzard warnings were issued for New York's Long Island and parts of southern New England with forecasters predicting whiteout conditions due to high winds. Is winter weather affecting you? Share stories, photos and videos . ""I strongly urge everyone to stay at home and off the roads,"" said Michael Cline, state coordinator for the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. ""There are hundreds of vehicles abandoned or stuck on roads. There is already one to two feet of snow on the roads, and snow is still falling."" Similar warnings were issued by state officials up and down the East Coast. Parts of U.S. 29, I-77 and I-81 were closed and hundreds of bus passengers were stranded at a terminal in Washington as nearly 300 routes were canceled from New England to Jacksonville, Florida, Greyhound Bus Lines spokeswoman Maureen Richmond said. Travelers stuck at Greyhound terminals are being made comfortable with assistance from the Red Cross and Salvation Army, Richmond said. See traffic and road closure information on the U.S. DOT Web site . The storm also affected rail service. Passengers aboard an Amtrak train that originated in New Orleans on Friday morning sat outside Alexandria, Virginia, for more than five hours Saturday afternoon. The train had full power, and passengers were being given food and drinks throughout the ordeal, Amtrak spokeswoman Vernae Graham said. She expected the train to pull into Washington Saturday night. Trains were running 30 to 60 minutes behind schedule early Saturday, and 60 to 90 minutes later in the day. Meanwhile, more than 400 people hunkered down in 20 shelters across Virginia. A Virginia National Guard spokesman said it is working with other agencies to transport stranded motorists to shelters, and is getting food and water to people stuck in their vehicles. As snow continued to fall in the mid-Atlantic states, folks in western North Carolina were digging out Saturday from the powerful storm. More than 50,000 were without power in Asheville's Buncombe County after more than a foot of snow fell in the mountains. Crews were traveling from Kentucky and South Carolina to help restore power, a spokeswoman for Progress Energy told CNN affiliate WLOS. In Washington, Mayor Adrian M. Fenty said the storm is ""perhaps the biggest we've seen in several years."" ""We are going to throw everything we have at it to keep the district open for business on this busy pre-holiday weekend,"" Fenty said when he announced the snow emergency. But, he also urged residents to stay in their homes. ""This snow should end early tomorrow morning with a 24-hour cleanup. We should have a lot of streets ready to go by rush hour Monday. And, hopefully, all of it done between Monday and Wednesday."" Nine people were taken to a hospital after a bus and a city snow plow collided, a D.C. fire official said. The injuries are not considered serious. The storm also halted above-ground Metrorail operations in the district because of heavy snowfall covering the electrified third rail, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority said. Trains were shifted to underground travel, and the underground Metrorail stations will remain open until 3 a.m., the normal closing time for a Saturday night. In West Virginia, Gov. Joe Manchin on Saturday declared a state of emergency and ""authorized the use of the National Guard to assist with snow removal and emergency assistance and operations."" West Virginia is working to help stranded motorists, clear roadways, and restore power outages, Manchin said in a statement. In Massachusetts, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino declared a snow emergency beginning at 10 p.m. Forecasters are predicting up to 15 inches of snow with 30 mph winds between Saturday night and late Sunday morning. Crews were standing by with snow removal equipment and salt, and the city's emergency homeless shelters will be open ""throughout the day and evening."" While the storm caused chaos for weekend travelers and shoppers, UPS spokesman Norman Black on Friday said shipped packages shouldn't be delayed. ""The good thing for us and our competitors is that this is happening on a weekend,"" Black said. He said that packages set for Monday delivery were on planes that landed and offloaded Friday night. UPS never has packages in motion on a Sunday, even the Sunday before Christmas. And because Saturday volume is usually light -- because delivering on Saturday is a premium service -- Black expected few problems. That is, unless the roads are still a mess and airports aren't cleaned by Monday.","Nor'easter blankets heavily populated Interstate 95 corridor from Tennessee to New England .

"(CNN) -- Cargill Meat Solutions Corp. has announced for the second time in less than six weeks a voluntary recall of ground turkey products after tests found they were contaminated with a strain of salmonella bacteria that can prove fatal. ""That's one of the challenges and frustrations about trying to get one's arms around a naturally and randomly occurring bacterium that exists throughout the environment,"" said Mike Martin, director of communications for the company in Wichita, Kansas. ""It is frustrating but it strengthens our resolve to also do more to find additional methods and measures that are going to further reduce the potential for pathogens that can cause food-borne illnesses."" The latest recall, of 185,000 pounds of ground turkey meat, was announced Sunday for products produced August 23 and 24, and 30 and 31 from the company's establishment in Springdale, Arkansas. No illnesses have been linked to the current recall. The previous recall was one of the largest in history, affecting 36 million pounds of ground turkey meat produced at the plant between February 20 and August 2. In all, 2 million pounds of the tainted meat were recovered and buried in a landfill. Federal health authorities said the August recall was associated with an outbreak of multi-drug-resistant Salmonella Heidelberg, which killed one person and sickened 111 others in 31 states. After the outbreak was discovered, the company suspended production of ground turkey products at the processing facility for eight days and instituted stricter production processes, Martin said. In the wake of the August recall, antibacterial washes were added and ""the most aggressive sampling and monitoring program in the industry"" was put into place, Martin said. But federal health officials took a sample on August 24 and found the same Heidelberg variant of the bacteria, one that is resistant to a number of antibiotics. A second sample taken on August 30 came back with a presumptive match, he said. ""We know it came in with the birds,"" he said. ""We're looking at the entire supply chain back to, obviously, bird farms."" He added, ""We understand that people expect their food to be safe when they purchase it, and we are going to do everything we can to ensure that's the case."" But the ubiquity of the bacteria means there could be similar recalls in the future, he said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service recommends meat be cooked to an inner temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 Celsius), a temperature that kills bacteria. Infection with the bacteria can cause people to develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The sickness usually lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment. But, in some cases, it can cause severe diarrhea and require hospitalization. If the infection spreads from the intestines to the bloodstream and then elsewhere in the body, the bacteria can prove fatal, according to public health experts.","Cargill Meat Solutions Corp. recalls 185,000 pounds of ground turkey meat products .

"Paris (CNN) -- Severe weather continued to disrupt travel across Europe Thursday, as heavy snowfall forced a border closure between France and Luxembourg and stranded thousands of airline passengers in Germany's busiest airport. The relentless snowfall shut down traffic on the A31, a major highway, which prompted the closing of the border. The severe weather also forced German officials to cancel 239 flights and order a four-hour shutdown of the Frankfurt airport. German's second largest airport, in Munich, announced the cancellation of 51 flights, most of them resulting from canceled flights at other airports. The border closing and flight cancellations come a day after heavy snow paralyzed travel in the Paris region, where officials suspended air traffic at one of Europe's busiest airports, closed several highways and shut down the Eiffel Tower. The tourist attraction reopened Thursday as officials downgraded a weather warning for central France from orange to yellow. French police urged motorists to avoid driving unless absolutely necessary to get to work. However, GÃ©rard Gauzet, director of Paris motorways, said Thursday morning that ""traffic should be back to normal by mid-afternoon."" The Paris Metro is also running smoothly, but weather continues to delay some bus traffic, which was completely shut down by snow on Wednesday. At Charles de Gaulle airport, ""air traffic is almost back to normal,"" according to an airport spokeswoman. ""However, passengers should be prepared for delays and cancellations depending on the airline,"" the spokeswoman said. Snowfall shut down air traffic for several hours in the afternoon Wednesday. The Wednesday traffic jams in the Parisian metro area set a new record. According to the National Center for Highway Information, snarled traffic lined 420 kilometers of roadways around the capital. Shelters opened in the region to take in stranded motorists, and many people reported spending the night in their offices after being unable to get home. Some disruptions were also reported on the region's railways Wednesday, with the high-speed TGV trains limited to a speed of 230 kph instead of the usual speeds of up to 320 kph, and several trains were delayed. Journalist Celine Martelet of radio station RMC told CNN affiliate BFM-TV on Wednesday she had been blocked on a highway near Paris for three hours.

"The ""Occupy Wall Street"" movement went global Saturday, crossing the Atlantic to many European cities, where protesters turned out by the thousands for largely peaceful demonstrations. In many cities, handfuls of protesters donned masks portraying a sinister, smiling face with a pointy black mustache and a thin lip beard taken from the movie ""V for Vendetta"" about a masked hero who fights against totalitarianism. Here's a country-by-country look at the European demonstrations: . Italy . An initially peaceful protest in central Rome turned violent Saturday, after anarchists -- some wearing ski masks and belonging to a group termed ""Black Bloc"" -- torched cars, broke windows and clashed with police. The violent group also fought with other protesters, who attempted to extricate the rowdy anarchists from the march.  Rocks, bottles and tear gas canisters flew, and an interior ministry building caught fire in the mayhem. Firefighters battled the blaze at the main gathering spot, the Piazza San Giovanni, which transformed into a battleground between police with water cannons on the one side and anarchists armed with knives, bats, Molotov cocktails and fireworks on the other, Newsweek correspondent Barbie Nadeau told CNN. Italy, which was hit hard by the global economic crisis, has been struggling with potentially crippling debt problems. Last month, Standard & Poor's cut Italy's sovereign credit rating, saying the nation's weakening economic growth and political uncertainty have dented its financial stability. Italy has debts equal to nearly 120% of its gross domestic product. Spain . More than 10,000 demonstrators of all ages gathered peacefully in Madrid's spacious Plaza de Cibeles on Saturday and than walked uphill  to Puerta del Sol, according to CNN correspondent Al Goodman. The ""May 15 Movement"" started five months ago to the day over austerity measures and high unemployment. Some demonstrators said they felt Spain's protest had gone global and that the world had joined the movement started in their country. The newspaper El Pais quoted Catalan regional police as saying an estimated 60,000 protesters turned out in Barcelona. CNN was unable to confirm that number Saturday evening. Along with Italy, Spain was hit by the financial crisis and subsequent European Union debt woes. It announced new measures recently meant to reduce its deficit, though investors continue to believe the country faces dim prospects. Standard & Poor's downgraded Spain's credit rating Friday, citing risks to economic growth and the banking sector. Spain is one of the so-called ""PIIGS,"" a group of fiscally distressed nations that include Portugal, Italy, Ireland and Greece. United Kingdom . An appearance by Julian Assange highlighted Saturday's ""Occupy London"" protest, when the WikiLeaks co-founder led the crowd in protest chants from the steps in front of St. Paul's Cathedral on the edge of London's financial district. Thousands marched through the streets protesting austerity cuts and criticizing bankers. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne told lawmakers in August that the road to economic recovery in Britain will be ""longer and harder than had been hoped"" and will require continued commitment to the government's deficit-reduction program. He noted that financial instability in Britain's main export markets has contributed to the country's reduced expectations for growth. Belgium . About 7,000 people marched through the EU capital of Brussels on Saturday, according to police. ""There has been no violence, some people have been stopped and checked but were later released, one has been arrested for assault on a police officer, but apart from that it has been calm,"" Christianne de Ridder, a spokeswoman for the Brussels police department, told CNN. Belgium's debt is expected to grow to 85% of GDP by 2015, according to the International Monetary Fund. Germany . Thousands took to the streets in front of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt as well as in other major cities, including the country's capital Berlin, where protesters marched to the Office of the Chancellor.  Protesters held up signs condemning corporate power and demanding stronger democracy and social justice. Germany, the region's economic powerhouse, reported a paltry 0.1% increase in second-quarter gross domestic product, compared with a more robust 1.3% in the first quarter. But economists say Germany is still on track for modest growth in 2011. The German economy is heavily dependent on exports and has benefited from rapid growth in emerging nations such as China. As activity cools in those markets, the outlook for Germany has dimmed. The slowdown raises troubling questions about the long-term outlook for the Euro Zone. Sweden . A small crowd gathered in Stockholm to join the ""Occupy"" protests.  About 400 demonstrators gathered at the central square in Stockholm then ""moved on to the Bank of Sweden where they protested some more, and then they went home,"" a police spokeswoman said. Sweden is known for its strong social democratic system, which provides for many needs of its citizens and protects the stability of Swedish jobs. Unlike some other members of the European Union, Sweden largely avoided the worldwide recession. Still, the country has a keen interest in helping members of the Euro Zone stay healthy economically. Last year, it offered to loan Ireland $1.5 billion to help it through a tight financial spot. Sweden also depends on the strength of its trading partners, such as Germany, which accounts for some 11% of Sweden's exports and 18% of its imports.","Anarchists turn peaceful protest violent in Rome .

"Myra Hilliard heard it before she saw it: The roar of what she believes was a tornado forming in her Stedman, North Carolina, neighborhood on Tuesday. Then she opened her front door to see it chew through the tree line across the street from her house. ""I grabbed my phone, and I ran and jumped in the bathtub,"" she told CNN. It was a scenario that played out repeatedly across the South as people were urged to keep an eye on the weather, with forecasters warning of tornadoes, high winds and hail spawned by storms that have left at least 35 people dead since Sunday. By Tuesday night, much of the fear of severe storms that could produce large tornado tracks in the eastern half of the United States, from Mississippi to New York, dissipated after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center downgraded the threat. Some storm risks remain, including the possibility of large hail, damaging winds and flash flooding in portions of the South and East Coast, forecasters said. Mississippi and Alabama -- where tornadoes Monday caused widespread destruction and several deaths -- were again in the bull's-eye for the worst of the forecast on Tuesday evening. A number of tornado warnings expired Tuesday night in North Carolina, where forecasters say the storm was barreling north. Authorities were assessing damage. Tens of thousands were without power in the South, where suspected tornadoes tore through homes and businesses late Monday. At least 17 people were killed in Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee on Monday. Those deaths are in addition to 18 others reported in Arkansas, Oklahoma and Iowa from storms Sunday. Search and rescue efforts were still under way in Louisville, Mississippi, about 90 miles northeast of Jackson, where a tornado the day before flattened a day care center, said Robert Latham of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant said the twisters inflicted ""severe damage"" in Louisville. Winston Medical Center, Louisville's major hospital, was also among the buildings hit. ""One of the confirmed deaths we received is the manager of that facility,"" he said, adding that search and rescue crews were still combing through the debris for possible victims. All the children have been accounted for, he said. Surprising tornado tidbits . Meanwhile, the storm that walloped Mississippi and Alabama overnight was making its way through parts of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Get the fast facts on tornadoes . 'It hurts to look' Monday's storms left a trail of damage through several Mississippi and Alabama communities. Mississippi authorities confirmed 12 deaths. Three people died in Alabama and two in Tennessee, according to officials. In Tupelo, birthplace of Elvis Presley, buildings near a major commercial district on the city's north side were ""wiped away,"" Scott Morris, a reporter for the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, told CNN's ""The Lead."" Numerous trees and power lines were down, and ""quite a few buildings are destroyed up there,"" Morris said. The storm destroyed Britney Butler's home in Tupelo, WMC-TV reported. ""It hurts to look, because I won't come home tonight,"" said Butler, who still managed to smile after discovering her dog had come out unscathed.  ""Oreo means the most to me."" As things got ugly, Matt Laubhan, the chief meteorologist at Tupelo television station WTVA, took charge. He ordered station staff to take cover before walking off the set himself. ""Basement. Now ... let's go,"" Laubhan said. Two people died in Lincoln County, Tennessee, near the border with Alabama. Part of an elementary school there was torn away, the building's roof was ripped off and the storm hurled a school bus into the school, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. The bus and school were empty at the time, the station said. Power outage safety tips . Alabama also hit hard . One of the three Alabama deaths was a 21-year-old University of Alabama student from Tupelo, according to the school. Jon Servati was a member of the school's swimming and diving team, the school's athletic department said in a statement. He died from injuries suffered at an off-campus home, the school said. The other two deaths came at a trailer park near Athens, about 22 miles west of Huntsville. The storm reduced a complex of houses and duplex apartments in the town to rubble. Downed power lines and gas leaks made the area dangerous, CNN's Brian Todd reported from Athens. Authorities in Limestone County, where Athens is located, asked people to stay off roads wherever possible Tuesday. Emergency crews need unimpeded access to roads, and extensive damage and downed power lines make travel hazardous, authorities said in the message transmitted by the National Weather Service. How you can help . In Jefferson County, Alabama -- site of the state's largest city, Birmingham -- a fire station was hit, as was a church. People were trapped for a time in the church, but no one was seriously injured, Horace Walker, a spokesman for county's emergency management agency, told ""New Day."" About 90,000 homes and businesses were without electricity Tuesday afternoon, according to Brian Corbett of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency. About 10,000 customers remained without power around Jackson, Mississippi, Entergy Mississippi reported. Video: See meteorologist take cover . Act II . Monday's storms were Act II of a powerful weather system that brought punishing thunderstorms to the central United States. Suspected tornadoes spawned by those storms on Sunday killed 15 people in Arkansas, two in Iowa and one in Oklahoma, authorities in those states reported. Sunday's hardest-hit area was Faulkner County, Arkansas, where a suspected tornado shattered homes, tossed tractor-trailers and killed 11 people in the towns of Vilonia and Mayflower, including one death newly reported by authorities on Tuesday.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Just because they named their new CD ""Yes,"" does not mean that British electro-pop duo, the Pet Shop Boys, will agree to just about anything. PETA has asked the Pet Shop Boys to change the band's name to Rescue Shelter Boys. The band has turned down a request from an animal rights group to rename itself the Rescue Shelter Boys. The organization, the People for the Ethical Treatment for Animals (PETA), sent a letter to Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe acknowledging that its request, at first blush, might appear ""bizarre."" But, by changing its name, the band could raise awareness at every tour stop of the ""cramped, filthy conditions"" that breeders keep animals in before selling them to pet stores, PETA said in its letter. Read how the Pet Shop Boys got their name . The duo, which has performed under its current name for more than 20 years, reproduced PETA's written request in full on its Web site. The musicians said they were ""unable to agree"" to the request ""but nonetheless think (it) raises an issue worth thinking about."" The animal rights group said it was pleased the Pet Shop Boys had drawn attention to the issue by posting its letter so prominently on the band's site. Talking about its campaign on a blog entry, a PETA staffer wrote: . ""I think I may have to stick ""West End Girls"" on my iPod right now to celebrate."" ""West End Girls"" is one of the many hits the group has had in its long career. PETA is no stranger to oddball campaigns.

"(CNN) -- Last week's attempted terror attack on an airplane heading from Amsterdam to Detroit has given rise to a bunch of familiar questions. How did the explosives get past security screening? What steps could be taken to avert similar attacks? Why wasn't there an air marshal on the flight? And, predictably, government officials have rushed to institute new safety measures to close holes in the system exposed by the incident. Reviewing what happened is important, but a lot of the discussion is off-base, a reflection of the fundamentally wrong conception most people have of terrorism and how to combat it. Terrorism is rare, far rarer than many people think. It's rare because very few people want to commit acts of terrorism, and executing a terrorist plot is much harder than television makes it appear. The best defenses against terrorism are largely invisible: investigation, intelligence, and emergency response. But even these are less effective at keeping us safe than our social and political policies, both at home and abroad. However, our elected leaders don't think this way: They are far more likely to implement security theater against movie-plot threats. A ""movie-plot threat"" is an overly specific attack scenario. Whether it's terrorists with crop dusters, terrorists contaminating the milk supply, or terrorists attacking the Olympics, specific stories affect our emotions more intensely than mere data does. Stories are what we fear. It's not just hypothetical stories -- terrorists flying planes into buildings, terrorists with explosives strapped to their legs or with bombs in their shoes, and terrorists with guns and bombs waging a co-ordinated attack against a city are even scarier movie-plot threats because they actually happened. ""Security theater"" refers to security measures that make people feel more secure without doing anything to actually improve their security. An example: the photo ID checks that have sprung up in office buildings. No one has ever explained why verifying that someone has a photo ID provides any actual security, but it looks like security to have a uniformed guard-for-hire looking at ID cards. Airport-security examples include the National Guard troops stationed at U.S. airports in the months after 9/11 -- their guns had no bullets. The U.S. color-coded system of threat levels, the pervasive harassment of photographers, and the metal detectors that are increasingly common in hotels and office buildings since the Mumbai terrorist attacks, are additional examples. To be sure, reasonable arguments can be made that some terrorist targets are more attractive than others: airplanes because a small bomb can result in the death of everyone aboard, monuments because of their national significance, national events because of television coverage, and transportation because of the numbers of people who commute daily. But there are literally millions of potential targets in any large country -- there are 5 million commercial buildings alone in the United States -- and hundreds of potential terrorist tactics. It's impossible to defend every place against everything, and it's impossible to predict which tactic and target terrorists will try next. Security is both a feeling and a reality. The propensity for security theater comes from the interplay between the public and its leaders. When people are scared, they need something done that will make them feel safe, even if it doesn't truly make them safer. Politicians naturally want to do something in response to crisis, even if that something doesn't make any sense. Often, this ""something"" is directly related to the details of a recent event. We confiscate liquids, screen shoes, and ban box cutters on airplanes. We tell people they can't use an airplane restroom in the last 90 minutes of an international flight. But it's not the target and tactics of the last attack that are important, but the next attack. These measures are only effective if we happen to guess what the next terrorists are planning. If we spend billions defending our rail systems, and the terrorists bomb a shopping mall instead, we've wasted our money. If we concentrate airport security on screening shoes and confiscating liquids, and the terrorists hide explosives in their brassieres and use solids, we've wasted our money. Terrorists don't care what they blow up and it shouldn't be our goal merely to force the terrorists to make a minor change in their tactics or targets. Our current response to terrorism is a form of ""magical thinking."" It relies on the idea that we can somehow make ourselves safer by protecting against what the terrorists happened to do last time. Unfortunately for politicians, the security measures that work are largely invisible. Such measures include enhancing the intelligence-gathering abilities of the secret services, hiring cultural experts and Arabic translators, building bridges with Islamic communities both nationally and internationally, funding police capabilities -- both investigative arms to prevent terrorist attacks, and emergency communications systems for after attacks occur -- and arresting terrorist plotters without media fanfare. They do not include expansive new police or spying laws. Our police don't need any new laws to deal with terrorism; rather, they need apolitical funding. The arrest of the ""liquid bombers"" in London is an example: They were caught through old-fashioned intelligence and police work. Their choice of target (airplanes) and tactic (liquid explosives) didn't matter; they would have been arrested regardless. But even as we do all of this we cannot neglect the feeling of security, because it's how we collectively overcome the psychological damage that terrorism causes. It's not security theater we need, it's direct appeals to our feelings. The best way to help people feel secure is by acting secure around them. Instead of reacting to terrorism with fear, we -- and our leaders -- need to react with indomitability, the kind of strength shown by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill during World War II. By not overreacting, by not responding to movie-plot threats, and by not becoming defensive, we demonstrate the resilience of our society, in our laws, our culture, our freedoms. There is a difference between indomitability and arrogant ""bring 'em on"" rhetoric. There's a difference between accepting the inherent risk that comes with a free and open society, and hyping the threats. We should treat terrorists like common criminals and give them all the benefits of true and open justice -- not merely because it demonstrates our indomitability, but because it makes us all safer. Once a society starts circumventing its own laws, the risks to its future stability are much greater than terrorism. Despite fearful rhetoric to the contrary, terrorism is not a transcendent threat. A terrorist attack cannot possibly destroy a country's way of life; it's only our reaction to that attack that can do that kind of damage. The more we undermine our own laws, the more we convert our buildings into fortresses, the more we reduce the freedoms and liberties at the foundation of our societies, the more we're doing the terrorists' job for them. Today, we can project indomitability by rolling back all the fear-based post-9/11 security measures. Our leaders have lost credibility; getting it back requires a decrease in hyperbole. Ditch the invasive mass surveillance systems and new police state-like powers. Return airport security to pre-9/11 levels. Remove swagger from our foreign policies. Show the world that our legal system is up to the challenge of terrorism. Stop telling people to report all suspicious activity; it does little but make us suspicious of each other, increasing both fear and helplessness. Counterterrorism is also hard, especially when we're psychologically prone to muck it up. Since 9/11, we've embarked on strategies of defending specific targets against specific tactics, overreacting to every terrorist video, stoking fear, demonizing ethnic groups, and treating the terrorists as if they were legitimate military opponents who could actually destroy a country or a way of life -- all of this plays into the hands of terrorists. We'd do much better by leveraging the inherent strengths of our modern democracies and the natural advantages we have over the terrorists: our adaptability and survivability, our international network of laws and law enforcement, and the freedoms and liberties that make our society so enviable. The way we live is open enough to make terrorists rare; we are observant enough to prevent most of the terrorist plots that exist, and indomitable enough to survive the even fewer terrorist plots that actually succeed. We don't need to pretend otherwise. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier. An earlier version of this essay appeared in New Internationalist magazine.","Incident on Detroit-bound plane led to tightening of airport security .

"ATLANTA (CNN) -- To a degree some may find hard to swallow, science is proving the old adage ""you are what you eat."" Americans eat corn in the form of chips but also consume it in the ubiquitous high fructose corn syrup. Proteins and fats in your food are incorporated into your body and brain with potentially profound effects on your health and even your behavior. Todd Dawson, a plant biologist at the University of California-Berkeley, can test a strand of hair to determine how much corn is in your diet or mine by looking for a form of carbon found in corn. ""We are what we eat with respect to carbon, for sure. So if we eat a particular kind of food, and it has a particular kind of carbon in it, that's recorded in us, in our tissues, in our hair, in our fingernails, in the muscles,"" Dawson says. Dawson tested a strand of my hair: 69 percent of the carbon came from corn. This may seem high, but it is typical for Americans. ""We're like corn chips walking because we really have a very, very large fraction of corn in our diets, and we actually can't help it because it's an additive in so many of the foods we find on the market shelves,"" Dawson says. Foods like ketchup, salad dressing, soda, cookies and chips all contain corn, usually high fructose corn syrup. ""I think where the danger comes in with corn is that much of the corn grown now in North America is going into making high fructose corn syrup,"" Dawson says. ""So it's not that corn per se is bad, but it's the sweetener made from corn that gets into many of the foods that Americans are probably consuming too much of, and we now see that showing up as obesity and heart disease and potential for type 2 diabetes."" To be fair, researchers say we're eating too much of all kinds of sugar, not just high fructose corn syrup. And the Corn Refiners Association points out that ""many parts of the world, including Mexico and Europe, have rising rates of obesity and diabetes, despite having little or no high fructose corn syrup in their foods and drinks."" Europeans eat a diet with far fewer processed foods and corn-based sweeteners. Dawson tested his own hair after three months in Italy: 5 percent corn. Americans also eat an extraordinary amount of soybean oil, another key ingredient in most processed foods. Checking labels during a recent trip to the grocery store I found soybean oil in everything from tortilla chips to fruit syrup. Dr. Joseph Hibbeln at the National Institutes of Health estimates that soybeans, usually in the form of oil, Â­ account for an astonishing 10 percent of our total calories in the United States. In recent years, a form of soybean oil has been the primary source of trans fats, which raises levels of LDL, or bad cholesterol, in our bodies and is thought to contribute to heart disease. Our bodies need a balance of omega-6 fatty acids like soybean oil and omega-3 fatty acids like fish oil, Hibbeln says. Over the last century, our diets have shifted almost completely to omega-6 fatty acids. ""It's quite likely that most of the diseases of modern civilization, major depression, heart disease and obesity are linked to the radical and dramatic shift in the composition of the fats in the food supply,"" Hibbeln says. Our brains are composed of fatty acids, and an absence of omega-3 fatty acids can actually change our behavior, according to Hibbeln. Hibbeln's research suggests diets containing omega-3 fatty acids found in fish reduce depression, aggression and anger, while improving mental well-being. Quite literally, food for thought.

"When an attorney involved in Pfc. Bradley Manning's sentencing hearing made reference Wednesday to something being ""normal"" in the WikiLeaks case, the former general promptly cut him off. ""There was nothing about WikiLeaks that was normal,"" said retired Army Brig. Gen. Robert Carr, a 31-year veteran. The prosecution called Carr to testify about his time with the Information Review Task Force put together when WikiLeaks first started releasing the documents leaked by Manning. The task force was charged with determining if any coalition members, intelligence sources or methods that had been put at risk by the leaks. About 900 Afghans were identified in some way in the documents, Carr said, but he didn't say if any of them were harmed. Asked if Manning had made the jobs of junior intelligence analysts more difficult by damaging their superiors' trust in them, Carr said it was ""hugely important to empower these young intel analysts."" As Manning's sentencing phase began Wednesday, the convicted leaker has already tallied 1,274 days behind bars. The question now is how many more of the potential 136 years he'll serve. The military will give Manning credit for each of his 1,162 days of pre-trial confinement, plus the judge, Col. Denise Lind, credited Manning with an additional 112 days for the harsh treatment he suffered while being held at a Marine Corps Base Quantico brig. The defense has also filed motions to have four of the charges on which he was found guilty merged into two. Lind isn't expected to rule on that motion before Friday. Convictions and acquittal . Lind acquitted Manning of the most grievous charge of aiding the enemy. Had she convicted him of that one charge, he could have spent life in prison without the possibility of parole. Manning still faces the prospect of a lengthy prisoner term. He was found guilty of 20 counts that include violations of the Espionage Act. Twelve of them carry maximum sentences of 10 years each. Lind may decide not to slap him with the maximum for each count. She may rule that he'll serve the sentences concurrently, rather than consecutively. Whistle-blower or traitor? It may take several days before she reaches a decision. Manning was convicted of stealing and disseminating about 750,000 pages of classified documents and videos to WikiLeaks. The leaks dealt with everything from U.S. military strategy in Iraq to State Department cables outlining foreign relationships. They also included a secret military video from the Iraq war. WikiLeaks has never confirmed the soldier was the source of its information. The military accused him of putting lives in danger, saying some of the material was found in Osama bin Laden's compound. Lind, in acquitting Manning of the main charge, said he didn't know that al Qaeda would get the material and therefore did not aid the enemy. Opinion: Bradley Manning betrayed America . Free speech . Manning said he just wanted the public to know what the government was doing. WikiLeaks supported his claim in a statement Tuesday blasting the convictions on the other counts as ""a dangerous precedent and an example of national security extremism."" What do his actions mean? ""It can never be that conveying true information to the public is 'espionage.' "" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange plans to talk about the verdict live on the Internet on Wednesday, according to a tweet from WikiLeaks' confirmed feed. Civil rights organizations also came out in support of Manning as a hero of free speech. ""The only reason why the government decided to proceed with this trial is so that it could pursue this dangerous theory that equates leaks to the press with aiding the enemy,"" said ACLU spokesman Ben Winzer. Others saw the acquittal on the main charge as a victory for free speech. Manning pleads guilty to some charges . ""It shows that a really very junior enlisted person can do battle with the federal government in a case where the government is really mad as hell about what happened here, throws everything it has at him, and its biggest charge fizzles,"" said Gene Fidell from the National Institute of Military Justice. Opinion: Manning verdict's lesson in a digital age . Citizen journalist . During Manning's sentencing hearing, Congress will convene a hearing on the future of the National Security Agency's surveillance programs in the wake of a second major intelligence leak: Edward Snowden's leaks of records to journalist Glenn Greenwald. Greenwald, who writes for the British daily newspaper The Guardian, believes Manning's convictions are evidence of differential justice, he told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday. He said the soldier was just doing the job journalists should do to make government transparent to Americans. Greenwald compared Manning to famed journalist Bob Woodward, who gained international fame when he broke the iconic Watergate wiretapping scandal. Its cover-up led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. ""Bob Woodward has written book after book after book and has become extremely rich by publishing secrets way more sensitive than anything Bradley Manning ever published,"" Greenwald said. The difference in the eyes of U.S. justice, in Greenwald's opinion: Woodward is well connected with senior officials who leak to him. Manning, he said, is not. Opinion: Unfair verdict on Manning .","900 Afghans identified in Manning leaks; unclear if any harmed, ex-general says .

"(CNN) -- A group cited by U.S. officials as a domestic terrorism threat claimed responsibility Friday for knocking down two radio station towers in Snohomish County, Washington. Much of the tower system, owned by radio station KRKO, was ""flattened like a pancake,"" the manager said. The Earth Liberation Front (ELF) issued a statement saying opponents of the towers argue that ""AM radio waves cause adverse health effects including a higher rate of cancer, harm to wildlife, and that the signals have been interfering with home phone and intercom lines."" ""When all legal channels of opposition have been exhausted, concerned citizens have to take action into their own hands to protect life and the planet,"" Jason Crawford, a spokesman for the group, said in a news release. Members of ELF have been sentenced for acts of domestic terrorism in the past. Though no one is known to have been killed in ELF attacks, the government defines domestic terrorism as use or threatened use of violence by a domestic group ""against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives,"" the FBI's then-domestic terrorism chief, James F. Jarboe, explained in congressional testimony in 2002. The towers belong to radio station KRKO. ""There's quite a bit of destruction to the antenna system and it will probably take at least three months to get it back up and operational again,"" station manager Andy Skotdal told CNN affiliate KIRO, adding that much of it was ""flattened like a pancake."" The station remained on the air by using a backup transmitter site, he said. KRKO is working with authorities to find those responsible, Skotdal said, adding, ""We'll use our own airwaves to do it."" The perpetrators stole an excavating machine out of a yard in order to knock down the towers, Skotdal said.  Watch the aftermath of the scene Â» . The Snohomish County Sheriff's Office said the Seattle office of the FBI is the lead investigative agency in the incident. Officials at the FBI office did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Snohomish County is just north of Seattle. The attack took place in an unincorporated part of the county, officials said. In its news release, the ELF describes itself as ""an international underground organization that uses direct action in the form of economic sabotage to stop the systematic exploitation and destruction of the planet. Since its inception in North America in 1996, the ELF has inflicted well over $150 million in damages to corporations and governmental agencies that are profiting from the destruction of the Earth.""","Earth Liberation Front: ""AM radio waves cause adverse health effects""

"(CNN) -- A jury has found five men guilty of conspiring to kill soldiers at Fort Dix, New Jersey, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office said Monday. Five men were accused in a plot to kill soldiers at Fort Dix in New Jersey. The defendants were acquitted of attempted murder charges but face life in prison. The jury spent six days deliberating. Six men were arrested on May 7, 2007, in New Jersey, as two of them were meeting a confidential government witness ""to purchase three AK-47 automatic machine guns and four semi-automatic M-16s to be used in an attack they had been planning from at least January 2006,"" according to a criminal complaint. The sixth defendant, Agron Abdullahu, pleaded guilty in October to a reduced charge of providing firearms to illegal aliens and received a sentence of 20 months in prison and three years of supervised release. ""For the 12 of us involved in these deliberations, this has been one of the most difficult things we've ever had to do,"" the jury said in a written statement given to the news media, according to CNN Radio affiliate KYW. ""We have not reached our conclusions lightly. The burden imposed on us has been heavy but we are confident that our verdict has been reached fairly and impartially."" For the conspiracy conviction, each of the defendants faces a sentence of as much as life in prison. They are to be sentenced in April. Abdullahu told the court in October that, from January 2006 to May 2007, he and Turkish-born Serdar Tatar, 25, provided firearms to brothers Dritan Duka, 30; Shain Duka, 27; and Eljvir ""Elvis"" Duka, 25. The Duka brothers, born in the former Yugoslavia, were in the United States illegally. Tatar and Abdullahu are both legal U.S. residents. The other defendant, Jordanian-born Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer, is the only U.S. citizen among them. The jury found one member of the group conducted surveillance at Fort Dix and Fort Monmouth in New Jersey, Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and the U.S. Coast Guard facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the U.S. attorney's office said in a written statement. The alleged Fort Dix plot came to light when two men gave an 8 mm videotape to a clerk at a Circuit City store in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, and asked him to convert it to DVD format. Authorities said the tape showed 10 young men shooting at a practice range and shouting in Arabic, ""Allahu Akbar,"" or ""God is great."" The clerk, Brian Morgenstern, said the video showed the men with handguns and rifles that appeared to be ""fully automatic weapons."" ""I saw some stuff on the film that was disturbing and it kind of gained my attention that way,"" he told CNN in May 2007. Morgenstern alerted the police, who initiated the investigation into the men, who were living in Philadelphia's southern New Jersey suburbs. Michael Riley, the lawyer for Shain Duka, said he will appeal the verdict. ""It's a certain time in our history where these certain types of allegations are very troublesome, and it's very difficult,"" he said. ""It's disappointing when it doesn't come out the way you think it should."" Tatar's lawyer, Richard Sparaco, predicted an appeal would be filed on behalf of all the defendants. U.S. District Judge Robert B. Kugler scheduled sentencing for the Duka brothers for April 22 and for Shnewer and Tartar on April 23.

"A few weeks ago, I said Mitt Romney's Hispanic outreach was not visible to the naked eye. I try to call 'em as I see 'em, even when it means criticism of my own party. Today, I see a Romney Hispanic blitz. Latino-Palooza is underway. Hispanic volunteers are holding events, making phone calls, knocking on doors. Romney began to spend significant resources on Spanish TV ads in swing states with a sizable Hispanic population. He's doing an interview with Telemundo, speaking to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and participating in a Univision Candidate Forum, all this week. My unsolicited advice to Romney: CONNECT! For the love of God, Mitt, acknowledge you are in front of Latinos. It's OK to talk to different communities about specific issues that affect them more than others. If done correctly and with sincerity, it is called speaking to your audience. If it strikes an inauthentic note, it's pandering. Earlier this year, Romney spoke to the Latino Coalition. He mentioned ""Latino"" twice, once while thanking his hosts. Recently, he spoke at an event in Miami, Florida. You may have thought it was taking place in Miami, Ohio. He made no comments specifically targeted to the thousands of Hispanics braving the heat and humidity to hear him. Romney never mentioned foreign policy toward Latin America, not even Cuba. How someone fails to do that in the heart of Cuban-American Miami is puzzling. Barack Obama, for his part, has been working the Latino community. In the past six months, it's reached a fever pitch. The Democrat National Convention was a parade of Latinos: elected officials, celebrities, singers, students and even an undocumented young woman, representing the Dreamer students who would qualify for legal status under a potential Dream Act. Obama knows winning the Latino vote is key. Just as crucial as the margin of victory is the level of turnout. Obama's task is to maintain his current numbers of 65% to 68% support and increase voter enthusiasm. Romney must chip away at Obama's lead. He will have a difficult time winning the election with his Hispanic poll numbers hovering around 30%. Hispanic events provide an opportunity to ask tough questions. Romney and Obama have some explaining to do. Like many other voters, Hispanics want to hear more specifics from Romney and Obama. Whether its economic policy or foreign policy, they would like the candidates to  get past lofty platitudes. Many Hispanics live in Florida, Nevada and Arizona, which have been disproportionately affected by the foreclosure crisis. They want to know how they are going to get out of houses that are underwater and mortgages that are overwhelming. Hispanic unemployment has run significantly higher than the national average (now 8.1%) during the Obama administration. It is still high at 10.2%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. On education, Hispanic dropout rates continue to be higher than the national average. Last year, it was estimated by one study to be as high as 28%. These are real problems that require real solutions. We want to hear concrete steps towards opportunity. Then there is immigration. Note to Romney: Take a deep breath. Close your eyes and jump! You must address this issue. Continuing to avoid it turns it into an albatross around your neck. Romney needs to move beyond his positions during the primary. He promised to veto the Dream Act. He should then tell us if and how he plans to confront the predicament these young people face. Proposing to staple a green card to the diploma of foreign students graduating from U.S. universities does not cut it. While he's at it, he should say what he plans to do about the administrative order issued by the Obama administration that provides Dreamers temporary status for two years. If he becomes president, will he revoke it or will he let the order stand for at least the initial two-year period? A simple yes or no will suffice. There also needs to be a responsible plan to deal with securing our borders and enforcing our immigration laws but also providing a practical and humane solution for the 11 million undocumented people already here. Unless it's meant as a lame attempt at humor, ""self-deportation"" is not an adequate response. Talking of self-deportation, there's a question as to whether Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state who advocates the concept and is credited as the architect of Arizona's controversial SB1070 law, is an adviser or a supporter to Romney. Which is it? Romney has not publicly embraced Dreamers, but he's had no difficulty embracing the guys who give us nightmares, such as Sheriff Joe Arpaio, U.S. Rep. Steve King of Iowa and Kobach. How should Hispanics feel about that and what role, if any, would any of them play in a Romney administration? Obama has his share of explanations to give. Many Latinos have felt great economic pain during his administration. Some of us, who don't think we should give one inch to anti-democratic regimes in Latin American, did not like seeing Obama in a discussion of missile defense, tap then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on the knee and promise more flexibility in a second term. What does that mean vis-a-vis the likes of Fidel Castro or Hugo Chavez? In 2008, Obama promised Hispanics he would pass comprehensive immigration reform. He had a majority in the House and Senate and a powerful mandate for his first two years, and he failed to so much as present a plan, much less push for its passage. Blaming Republicans for his broken promise is silly. He passed his other priorities, including health care reform and the stimulus package, with practically no Republican support. Those first two years, where Obama showed will, he found a way. He chose not to make immigration a priority. Why should we believe him now? How does he plan to pass any meaningful reform in his second term when 1) he will be a lame duck from day one; and 2) he will in all likelihood have a Republican-controlled House and very divided Senate? Obama has not been known to cultivate congressional allies, Democrat or Republicans. Passing controversial legislation will not be easy. Four years ago, Obama chanted, ""Si, se puede!"" (Yes, we can!) He's grown older and grayer; so have we. He couldn't and didn't in his first term. He'd be well-served to acknowledge that and take some responsibility, instead of just laying the blame elsewhere. Hispanics are disappointed in Obama and distrustful of Romney. Both of them have seven weeks to change that. The clock is ticking.","Ana Navarro: Romney is furiously wooing Latino voters now. Some advice: Connect!
She says at events, he fails to acknowledge Latinos' concerns, but he must for support .

"London (CNN) -- A teenager has been arrested near London in connection with the hacking of Sony, London's Metropolitan Police said Tuesday. The 19-year-old is suspected of hacking into systems and mounting denial of service attacks against ""a number of international businesses and intelligence agencies,"" police said. Naming suspects who have been arrested is illegal in Britain. A police spokesman, who declined to be named in line with custom, said the arrested man's computers will be examined for activities related to hacks against the UK's Serious Organized Crime Agency, the CIA and Sony. Sony's PlayStation Network went down on April 20 after what Sony said was a massive data breach. It had more than 70 million subscribers at the time. It began coming back online in mid-May. The PlayStation Store did not reopen until June 2. The company estimated the cost of that attack will total $171 million. Hackers later broke into Sony Pictures' website, compromising the accounts of over 1 million users, and the gaming company Sega, stealing nearly 1.3 million users' details via a British subsidiary of the Japanese company. Sega makes games for PlayStation and other gaming systems. The suspect's computer will also be examined for links to LulzSec, another police spokesman told CNN, who also declined to be named in line with custom. ""This link has not been established yet as it is still early days,"" the spokesman said. The hacker group LulzSec posted an irreverent denial that its leader was the one arrested. ""Seems the glorious leader of LulzSec got arrested, it's all over now ... wait ... we're all still here! Which poor bastard did they take down?"" they said on Twitter several hours after the announcement of the arrest. LulzSec claimed recently to have attacked the CIA website, and took credit for hacking into the website of the American public broadcaster PBS and posting a fake story saying the rapper Tupac Shakur was still alive. He was killed nearly 15 years ago. It's unclear whether LulzSec members played a role in the Sony PlayStation Network breach. But they have posted on their website what they claim is proprietary information from Sony Pictures and other Sony properties' websites. On Friday, on the occasion of their 1,000th tweet, the group posted a manifesto of sorts in which they said people, including their targets and advocates of Internet freedom, should be thankful. ""The main anti-LulzSec argument suggests that ... our actions are causing clowns with pens to write new rules for you,"" the group wrote. ""But what if we just hadn't released anything? What if we were silent? That would mean we would be secretly inside FBI affiliates right now, inside PBS, inside Sony ... watching ... abusing ... ."" They seemed to suggest that by making their attacks public, they'll push websites to increase security. They said they're sitting on account information for 200,000 players of the online game Brink, but moments later said that releasing people's information is worth doing sometimes because it's fun. ""Yes, yes, there's always the argument that releasing everything in full is just as evil, what with accounts being stolen and abused, but welcome to 2011,"" they wrote. ""This is the lulz lizard era, where we do things just because we find it entertaining."" Analysts said the group appears to be some sort of spin-off of ""Anonymous,"" the loose coalition of hackers that grew to prominence through their support of the whistle-blower site WikiLeaks. But while Anonymous has its own set of moral codes and is largely politically motivated, LulzSec seems to be random. For every hack like the one on PBS, which the group said came out of anger over a documentary about WikiLeaks, there's the cracking of porn site pron.com -- and a subsequent public list of members' e-mail addresses and passwords. The teen suspect was arrested in Essex, outside London, in a raid that police said was ""intelligence-led."" The suspect was arrested Monday night and police are now examining a ""significant amount of material,"" they said. CNN's Per Nyberg, Carol Jordan and Doug Gross contributed to this report.","NEW: Hacker's computers to be examined for information related to UK police, CIA and Sony hacks .

"(CNN) -- To project elections, CNN and its election experts use scientific statistical procedures to make estimates of the final vote count in each race. CNN will broadcast a projected winner only after an extensive review of data from a number of sources. CNN editorial policy strictly prohibits reporting winners or characterizing the outcome of a statewide contest in any state before all the polls are scheduled to close in every precinct in that state. CNN will receive information from the following sources: . The Associated Press: The Associated Press will provide vote totals for each race. The AP will be gathering numbers via stringers based in each county or other jurisdiction where votes are tabulated. Edison Research: To assist CNN in collecting and evaluating this information, CNN, the other television networks and The Associated Press have employed Edison Research. In previous elections, this firm has assisted CNN in projecting winners in state and national races. Edison will conduct exit polls, which ask voters their opinion on a variety of relevant issues, determine how they voted, and ask a number of demographic questions to allow analysis of voting patterns by group. Using exit poll results, precincts scientifically selected at random, vote results from The AP, and a number of sophisticated analysis techniques, Edison also recommends projections of a winner for each race it covers. Collecting data . The process of projecting races begins by creating a sample of precincts. The precincts are selected by random chance, like a lottery, and every precinct in the state has an equal chance to be in the sample. They are not bellwether precincts or ""key"" precincts. Each one does not mirror the vote in a state but the sample collectively does. The first indication of the vote comes from the exit polls conducted by Edison. On the day of the election, Edison interviewers stand outside of precincts in a given state. They count the people coming out after they have voted and are instructed to interview every third person or every fifth person, for example, throughout the voting day. The rate of selection depends on the number of voters expected at the polling place that day. They do this from the time the polling place opens until shortly before it closes. The interviewers give each selected voter a questionnaire, which takes only a minute or two to complete. It asks about issues that are important, and background characteristics of the voter, and it also asks for whom they voted in the most important races. During the day, the interviewer phones the information from the questionnaires to a computer center. Next, vote totals come in from many of the same sample precincts as the exit polls after the voting has finished in those precincts. These are actual votes that are counted after the polls have closed. Election officials post the results so anyone at the precinct can know them. The third set of vote returns come from the vote tallies done by local officials. The local figures become more complete as more precincts report vote returns. The county or town vote is put into statistical models, and Edison makes estimates and projections using those models. In addition, CNN will be monitoring the Web sites of the Secretaries of State offices to help analyze the outcome of early voting and absentee voting. Projections . The projections for CNN will be made from the CNN Election Analysis Center at the Time Warner Center. An independent team of political analysts and statistical experts will analyze the data that will lead to the final decisions on projections. CNN will decide when and how to make a projection for a race depending on how close the race is. In races that do not appear to be very close, projections may be made at poll closing time based entirely on exit poll results, which are the only information available when the polls close about how people voted. The races projected from exit polls alone are races with comfortable margins between the top two candidates. Projections from exit polls also take into account the consistency between exit poll results and pre-election polls. In the case of close races, CNN will wait for actual votes to be tabulated and reported. Edison may make projection recommendations to its clients, but CNN will make all final calls for broadcast. Shortly after poll closing time, CNN may make projections using models that combine exit polls and actual votes. This happens in closer races. For extremely close races, CNN will rely on actual votes collected at the local level. These are the races that cannot be projected when the polls close from exit polls or even from actual votes collected at the sample precincts mentioned earlier. The projection for these races will be based on a statistical model that uses the actual votes. If it is too close for this model to provide a reliable projection, CNN will wait for election officials to tally all or almost all the entire vote. What a projection call means . CNN analysts will make all projections for CNN broadcasts. When CNN's analysts project a winner in a race, whether it is based upon data from Edison or from the CNN computations, it means that when all the votes are counted, CNN projects that the candidate will win the race. A projection is as close to statistical certainty as possible, but that does not mean that a mistake cannot happen; rather, it means that every precaution has been taken to see that a mistake is not made. CNN will not ""declare"" someone a winner because that declaration is up to election officials. CNN will make projections based on our best estimate of how CNN expects an election to turn out. When a lot of vote returns have been tallied, a race may be referred as ""too close to call"" by CNN anchors and analysts. ""Too close to call"" means the final result will be very close and that the CNN analysts may not know who won. For the races that are the closest, the CNN Election Analysis Desk will keep CNN viewers up to date on the state-by-state rules regarding automatic recounts and will report immediately on any official candidate challenge regarding the results or voting irregularities.","CNN receives data from The Associated Press, Edison Research .

"(CNN)  -- ""Captain Hutaree,"" his wife and two sons planned with other militia members to kill a law enforcement official to draw the officer's colleagues to the funeral, authorities say. Then, according to an indictment unsealed Monday, the militia planned to attack the funeral procession to kick off its war against the U.S. government. Members of the Hutaree militia, whose Web site says it is preparing for end times to ""keep the testimony of Jesus Christ alive,"" have been indicted on five counts, including seditious conspiracy and attempting to use weapons of mass destruction. Federal authorities allege militia members had declared war against law enforcement and ""foot soldiers"" of the federal government. They had conducted ""military-style training"" in Lenawee County, Michigan, about 35 miles northwest of Toledo, Ohio, since 2008, the indictment said. The group's Web site outlines the militia's philosophy: ""Jesus wanted us to be ready to defend ourselves using the sword and stay alive using equipment. The only thing on Earth to save the testimony and those who follow it are the members of the testimony, till the return of Christ in the clouds."" The group's leader, David Brian Stone -- aka ""Joe Stonewall"" or ""Captain Hutaree"" -- allegedly planned to kill a law enforcement officer to instigate a war against the U.S. government. In a phone interview Monday with CNN, Donald Stone, David Stone's brother, said he wasn't aware that his sibling was a member of the Hutaree militia nor did he believe David would set out to harm police officers. ""No, I don't believe that would ever happen,"" he said. ""That takes a very dark person."" Donald Stone said his brother, whom he said he hasn't seen in months, is employed in a factory and ""works like everyone else. Life's a struggle."" The indictment alleges that killing a law enforcement official would be just the beginning:  ""As a consequence of this act, law enforcement officers from throughout the nation would be drawn to and gather in the Eastern District of Michigan for the funeral,"" the indictment said. ""According to the plan, the Hutaree would then attack law enforcement vehicles during the funeral procession with improvised explosive devices with explosively formed projectiles."" The federal conspiracy charges say the militia devised several options for killing a law enforcement officer: after a traffic stop, during an ambush in a rural community, or by ""luring a member of law enforcement with a false 911 emergency call."" The militia also considered killing a law enforcement official and family members at home, the indictment said. The intention of the group was that such acts ""would intimidate and demoralize law enforcement, diminishing their ranks and rendering them ineffective,"" the indictment said. The militia would then retreat to a rally point where it would ""wage war against the government and be prepared to defend in-depth with trip-wired and command-detonated anti-personnel improvised explosive devices."" Hutaree members believe, according to the indictment, that their fight would ""serve as a catalyst for a more widespread uprising against the government."" The government alleges that, in preparation for such an uprising, the militia acquired firearms, ammunition, explosives, uniforms, communication devices, vehicles and medical supplies. The militia also conducted military-style drills, including explosives and firearms training, as well as ""close-quarter battle drills."" Members also prepared defensive fighting positions, including ""ambush kill zones"" and storage bunkers, the indictment said. On February 6, Stone and several others intended to travel to Kentucky to meet with other militia groups, but weather conditions prevented them from reaching their destination. However, according to the indictment, Stone contacted ""a person he believed capable of manufacturing destructive devices to provide him with four anti-personnel improvised explosive devices to take with them to the summit."" The indictment alleges that Stone identified law enforcement officers near his residence -- and one in particular -- as potential targets. Stone announced a covert reconnaissance exercise that was scheduled for next month, the indictment said, adding that ""anyone who happened upon the exercise who did not acquiesce to Hutaree demands could be killed."" The Hutaree Web site's main page, viewed Monday by CNN, announced an April 24 training exercise and asked visitors to ""contact headquarters immediately."" Stone and six co-conspirators engaged in training as recently as February 20, the indictment said, and each used at least one firearm. U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade explained the federal raid's timing in a statement announcing the indictment. ""Because the Hutaree had planned a covert reconnaissance operation for April which had the potential of placing an unsuspecting member of the public at risk, the safety of the public and of the law enforcement community demanded intervention at this time.""","NEW: Brother of suspect denies knowing of sibling's involvement in plot to kill law officers .

"(CNN)In 1985, Meng Weina set up China's first private special needs school in the southern city of Guangzhou. As a single mother she was motivated to help those who are often overlooked by the country's health care system and stigmatized by society. From her first center in Guangzhou, Weina now has Hui Ling operations in a dozen cities across China providing a range of services, from kindergartens and primary schools to youth workshops and adult residential homes. The expansion of the donation-funded NGO shows not just the success of the Weina's vision but the desperate need for mental health care provision in China. ""We estimate that only 10% of people with intellectual disabilities in China are receiving some kind of care or help,"" said Weina. According to a 2009 study published in British medical journal The Lancet, around 173 million Chinese suffer from a mental disorder. However there are only 20,000 psychiatrists, equaling 1.5 for each 100,000 people, or a tenth of the ratio in the United States. Mental health legislation . Last year saw the introduction of China's first mental health legislation, which took a reported 27 years to pass. Among the changes from the law are new financing initiatives for mental health services and training for primary care-givers. Perhaps the most significant was a new set of rights for patients, including not being hospitalized against their will. Negative perceptions of those with metal health problems are often portrayed in the media in China; they are either victims or perpetrators of violence. Weina knows that each individual that comes to a Hui Ling center has their own set of needs and unique personality, and helping bring out their best encourages her to keep working. ""I wanted to do something to make my life worth while,"" said Weina.

"(CNN) -- After scouring northern Colorado by foot and air, frantically chasing a Mylar balloon for miles and repeatedly interviewing his big brother, authorities ended the search for 6-year-old Falcon Heene where it began -- at his house. 6-year-old Falcon Heene says he was hiding in a box in the attic while authorities were searching for him. He was in a box. In the attic. The whole time. ""I played with my toys and took a nap,"" Falcon told a group of reporters outside his home Thursday afternoon. ""He says he was hiding in the attic,"" said Falcon's father, meteorologist Richard Heene, clutching his son. ""He says it's because I yelled at him."" ""I'm sorry I yelled at him,"" added Heene, tearfully hugging the boy. In a later interview with CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" Falcon said he heard his parents call for him from the garage. When asked by his father on-air why he didn't respond, the boy replied, ""You guys said we did this for the show."" When the father was pressed by Wolf Blitzer, who was filling in for King, to explain what his son meant, he became uncomfortable, finally saying he was ""appalled"" by the questions, and then adding that Falcon was likely referring to all the media coverage.  Watch the Heenes talk about the ordeal on CNN's Larry King Live Â» . Authorities said they believe the case was genuine. The situation grabbed the nation's attention early Thursday afternoon, after authorities reported that the experimental helium balloon was set adrift with the 6-year-old apparently riding in it. Heene said the family was in the early stages of working on the balloon -- a ""3D low-altitude vehicle"" -- when the contraption and the boy went missing. His brother had said he watched Falcon get into the balloon before he untied the tethers, setting it free. Heene later said Falcon was videotaped getting into the vessel by his brother, but ""obviously he got out."" Once it was untethered, the saucer-like craft flew eastward from the Heenes' neighborhood, though officials couldn't immediately confirm how fast it was going.  Watch the balloon float thousands of feet over Colorado Â» . Authorities said the silver balloon, 20-feet long and 5-feet high, at times reached 7,000 feet above the ground while adrift. It was found more than 90 minutes later in a field near Colorado Springs. The story took a turn when ABC said that Falcon's parents, science enthusiasts Richard and Mayumi Heene, were featured on the 100th episode of ABC's prime-time program ""Wife Swap"" in March 2009. According to the network's Web site, the Heene family ""devote(s) their time to scientific experiments that include looking for extraterrestrials and building a research-gathering flying saucer to send into the eye of the storm."" Richard Heene is a meteorologist and former television weatherman who has submitted to CNN iReports accounts of his sons helping him chase Hurricane Gustav, among other contributions. iReport.com: Heene family chases a storm . Rescuers from several counties followed the saucer-like vessel until it made a soft landing some 90 miles away. Officials rushed to the scene of the landing, smacking the metallic balloon until it deflated. They looked inside -- no Falcon. At that point, there were two possibilities: Either Falcon never got in the balloon, or he fell out. Authorities began to fear the worst after reports surfaced that a box possibly carrying Falcon may have fallen off the balloon. A Weld County Sheriff's deputy had said he saw an object fall off the balloon somewhere over Platteville, Colorado, which is in the search area. There was no box attached when the balloon landed at 1:35 p.m.  See map of balloon's trip Â» . The widespread worries prompted the Colorado Air National Guard to deploy a UH 60 Black Hawk helicopter, with plans to launch a second one equipped with night vision if necessary. The search, which initially focused on Weld County, covered ""the entire flight plan, from the Fort Collins area down to the Denver International Airport area,"" Col. Mark Riccardi said. But a little while later, Falcon turned up at home. Larimer County Sheriff James Alderden said it's not uncommon for children to seek cover when they realize they're the subject of a massive search. ""They hide because they think they are in trouble,"" he said. ""What was confusing was the eyewitness who said [Falcon] climbed into the apparatus, which was not the case,"" Alderden said, referring to the boy's brother. The sheriff said the brother was interviewed several times by investigators and that he was consistent with his story.

"White House officials have pressured insurance industry executives to keep quiet amid mounting criticism over Obamacare's rollout, insurance industry sources told CNN. Sebelius: 'I apologize, I'm accountable' for Obamacare website flaws . After insurance officials publicly criticized the implementation, White House staffers contacted insurers to express their displeasure, industry insiders said. Multiple sources declined to speak publicly about the push back because they fear retribution. But Bob Laszewski, who heads a consulting firm for big insurance companies, did talk on the record. ""The White House is exerting massive pressure on the industry, including the trade associations, to keep quiet,"" he said. Laszewski, who's been a vocal critic of Obamacare, said he's been asked by insurance executives to speak out because they feel defenseless against an administration that is regulating their business -- and a big customer. Government-backed plans accounted for about half of health care policies last year, a number that is expected to grow over the years. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the idea that administration officials are trying to silence insurance industry insiders is ""preposterous and inaccurate."" He added that Laszewski has been a vocal critic of health care reform for two decades. ""Plus, it ignores the fact that every day insurance companies are out talking about the law  -- in large part because they are trying to reach millions of new customers who will now have new affordable insurance options available from providers through the new Market Places,"" Carney said. Obama and his top advisers have acknowledged problems with the health care website. On Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was the latest administration official to apologize for the bungled rollout.

"The recession has been rough on everyone -- except maybe Bruce Springsteen, who's emerged with some good material for his new album. He says ""Wrecking Ball"" was inspired by Occupy Wall Street, and even though some of these songs were written before anyone pointed a bullhorn at the banks, he's smart to make that declaration. Whenever America's falling on hard times, his music simply sounds better, his lyrics taking on near-biblical significance. Take 2000's ''My City of Ruins,'' which was originally written to help promote the revitalization of Asbury Park, New Jersey, but took on an entirely new meaning after September 11, when he began introducing it as ''a prayer for our fallen brothers and sisters.'' Or there's 2005's ''Devils & Dust,'' penned before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which became a de facto anti-Iraq-war song after he added a coda for the troops: ''Bring 'em home!'' Whenever there's a movement in need of an anthem, it turns out Springsteen has already written one. There's no doubt that die-hard fans will hear a fierce rallying cry on behalf of the 99 percent on ""Wrecking Ball."" With an awesomely rootsy production style that recalls 2006's ""The Seeger Sessions,"" the album even sounds like a cross section of America, drawing from folk, gospel, and hip-hop. And on ""Ball's"" best moments, Springsteen is fired up enough to borrow a socket wrench and knock out Lehman Brothers' teeth. The working-man paean ''We Take Care of Our Own'' recalls ''Born in the U.S.A.'' both in its upbeat E Street boogie and in its ironic message, which practically dares some Republican to misinterpret it as a campaign song. Elsewhere, the moving title track (one of the last to feature the late, great Clarence Clemons) stands among his best blue-collar anthems, with a chorus that's the perfect prayer for anyone who's been laid off: ''Hold tight to your anger/And don't fall to your fears.'' Of course, that message could just as easily apply to football fans. (He actually wrote ''Wrecking Ball'' about the demolition of Giants Stadium.) That's the problem here: The images are so broad -- every song's got a rising flood or a train of sinners or a dead man's moon -- you'll be dying for a detail that's anchored in the real world, circa 2012. True, Springsteen's ballads have always been made of archetypes like rivers and fast cars. But he's rarely written anything as excruciatingly vague as ''You've Got It,'' which plays like Twenty Questions clues: ''Ain't no one can break it/Ain't no one can steal it.... You just know it/When you feel it.'' Though there are heartfelt tributes to the downtrodden, the only overt reference to the financial collapse comes in ''Easy Money,'' when he scoffs at ''all them fat cats.'' The money may be easy -- but the target is too. B . See the full article at EW.com.","Bruce Springsteen says ""Wrecking Ball"" was inspired by Occupy Wall Street .

"We know an industry is in crisis when its top institutions cannot establish stable leadership. That is the case with some of our nation's best public universities today. When the Board of Visitors at the University of Virginia pressured President Teresa Sullivan to resign on June 10, she became the fourth leader of a flagship public university to leave office under a cloud of controversy recently. The other casualties included the highly respected leaders of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the University of Illinois and the University of Oregon. The president of the University of California at Berkeley has also announced that he will step down in December. Leaders of public universities in other states face equally strong pressures to go. The men and women in these jobs seem to have a target on their backs. This can't go on. Our nation's public universities are the heart and soul of our higher education system, which is the envy of the world. Flagship public universities educate more of the brightest high school students than private universities in many states. They conduct the lion's share of advanced research. They also attract the largest number of foreign students. If our public universities fall into a decline because of a leadership vacuum, then our entire system will decline, too. University leaders are an endangered species because they are wedged between opposing and powerful pressures that are undermining public universities. Government officials in state capitals want to cut funding while requiring far-reaching reforms. They demand more control over costs that have risen much faster than inflation or family income in the last decade. They also ask for increased public access to flagship universities through traditional and online forms of education. Governors and legislators want all these benefits as they continue to reduce state expenditures for higher education. Professors and administrators on campus view these reforms as attacks on serious education and research. Advanced training in the sciences, engineering and humanities requires intensive small-group work that cannot be subjected to assembly-line efficiencies. Anyone who has taught writing, for example, knows that there is no substitute for the instructor sitting with the student and going line-by-line through each sentence. The same is true for theoretical physics, medicine, law and many other fields. You need extended time and personal contact for young minds to mature as effective thinkers. That is expensive, but it is money well spent for the good of the society. It's the same for advanced research. Innovation and creativity require freedom, security and flexibility. Scholars must have the ability to pursue a question in depth and examine its many implications. Sometimes an important project may take years to complete. Without university research of this kind we would not have many of the technologies and medicines we take for granted today. Governors and legislators have a strong argument about the elitism, the inefficiency and the sometime self-serving nature of university faculty. Professors have a strong case for the merits of what they do, and the remarkable record of achievements and historical job-creation coming out of our best public universities. The system works for some, but not for everyone. The system produces value, but at costs that might not be sustainable. University leaders are caught in the middle. Governors are impatient for new ""efficiencies."" Professors are adamant about protecting the freedom necessary for their work. University presidents have the title to address these issues, but they have little power when funding is tight and the two sides are equally uncompromising. No one wants to acknowledge the legitimacy of the other side's point of view. Wealthy alumni groups are very generous and loyal to their alma maters, but they cannot solve this crisis. Although alumni want their universities to be the best in the world, their support (as generous as it may be) cannot replace government money. Despite steep decreases in state funding for universities, state and federal agencies provide the largest share of money to public universities for research and related activities. The National Institutes of Health, for example, is the dominant funder for medical research in the world. States own the land on which public university campuses are built. So where do we go from here? Reforms to public universities are indeed necessary, but they will not emerge effectively from political attacks and vindictive cuts. What we need is an open and participatory process where university boards, state leaders, faculty, students and campus presidents formulate measurable goals for reasonable reforms, cost-savings, and more efficiency. These discussions should also include meaningful incentives for increased excellence (in teaching and research), public accessibility and international recognition. University presidents should be empowered to pursue these goals, in a reasonable time frame, with transparent accountability. While faculty must preserve the essential freedoms for their creativity, they cannot expect to do this by protecting privileges at all costs. Along with administrators, they have to accept changes to their comfortable routines. If both state and campus communities contribute to mutually beneficial changes, the reformed public university of the 21st century will be much improved. At present, the attacks on university leaders from all sides are attacks on the very idea of a public university. When Thomas Jefferson designed the University of Virginia, and when Abraham Lincoln created the federal land-grant system to finance public education, they had a faith that the most advanced intellectual work would improve the nation as a whole. That is what they meant by the ""public"" in university. Jefferson and Lincoln's support for public higher education made the United States a model for the rest of the world. We need leaders in government and on campus with the same vision -- the same desire to use limited resources not as instruments for political or personal advantage, but as opportunities for constructive engagement and the greatest long-term public good. Public universities need protection and they also need serious, thoughtful reform. Let's start with giving university presidents a fair chance to do their work.","Jeremi Suri: Some of the best public universities in America are losing their presidents .

"Twitter is coming forward as the latest site to be hacked. The social network said in a blog post Friday afternoon that approximately 250,000 user accounts were potentially compromised, with attackers gaining access to information including user names and email addresses. The company first detected signs of an attack earlier in the week, which led to an investigation and the discovery of a larger breach. ""This week, we detected unusual access patterns that led to us identifying unauthorized access attempts to Twitter user data. We discovered one live attack and were able to shut it down in process moments later,"" said Bob Lord, Twitter's director of information security, in a post. ""However, our investigation has thus far indicated that the attackers may have had access to limited user information."" Twitter has reset the passwords and revoked session tokens, which allow you to stay logged into the service without reentering a password, for all of these accounts. Affected users will not be able to log in and will receive an e-mail instructing them to reset their password. The post doesn't go into details about the methods the attackers used, but does refer to a recent Java vulnerability. The Department of Homeland Security recently warned users about the issue and suggested they disable Java in their browsers unless ""it is absolutely necessary."" This attack follows major security breaches at the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, which were both attributed to Chinese hackers. The New York Times suspects it was in response to negative coverage of the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, and the Journal said evidence pointed to an attempt to ""target the monitoring of the Journal's coverage of China."" The Washington Post announced late Friday that it too had experienced attacks that fit the profile in 2011, and Bloomberg News acknowledged that it was targeted but said no computers were compromised. While the Twitter post does not mention China or blame the hacks on any specific country or group, it does mention the news organization hacks. ""This attack was not the work of amateurs, and we do not believe it was an isolated incident. The attackers were extremely sophisticated, and we believe other companies and organizations have also been recently similarly attacked,"" said Lord. A quarter-million accounts is a small segment of Twitter's 200 million monthly active users worldwide.

"Whitney Houston drowned face down in a tub of ""extremely hot water"" about 12 inches deep, the final autopsy report on the singer's death said. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Houston's February 11 death was an accidental drowning with the ""effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use"" as contributing factors. The coroner's report stopped short of detailing what happened to Houston, but HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky, an addiction medicine specialist, examined the autopsy report for CNN and suggested she might have suffered a seizure brought on by the use of cocaine possibly combined with a withdrawal from alcohol and a prescription sedative. An empty bottle of the Xanax was found in her room, but the level of the sedative found in her blood was low, he said. Empty beer bottles were also found, but alcohol was not detected in her body, he said. ""To me, a sudden drop off in the Xanax level, a drop off in your alcohol consumption, add cocaine, that's a recipe for a seizure,"" Pinsky said.  ""Somebody who's now upside down in a bathtub could easily seize and drown."" However, Henry Spiller, a toxicologist and director of the Kentucky Regional Poison Control Center, said the level of Xanax found in Houston's blood was not low enough to trigger a seizure. Those who abuse Xanax can take up to 20 pills a day, he said, and the level found in Houston's body would indicate she took four to six pills several hours before she died. Since the drug was found in her blood, a seizure brought on by withdrawal is unlikely, he said. The coroner's report notes that Houston suffered several small scald burns on her face at the time of her death. A 60% narrowing of her arteries found in the autopsy is ""very mild heart disease,"" Pinsky said, which should not have caused a problem. Spiller said that based on his experience with cocaine abusers, two things may have happened -- either Houston had a seizure and fell into the tub, or had a cardiac arrhythmia. An arrhythmia occurs when the heart stops beating properly and fails to pump for a period of time, depriving the brain of oxygen and causing a loss of consciousness. It can be fatal. ""If you look at cocaine deaths, more deaths are from arrhythmias than seizures,"" Spiller said. ""Based on what is the report, it seems more likely that she had a vasospasm (which shuts off blood flow to the heart) or a fatal arrhythmia."" Toxicology testing measured .58 micrograms of cocaine per milliliter of blood drawn from a vein in her leg during the autopsy, which Pinsky called a moderate level. Spiller said for that level of cocaine to be in Houston's body, ""we're talking about approximately half a gram of cocaine having been possibly ingested within 30 minutes to 90 minutes before her death. For someone who has been abusing cocaine, this may be their routine amount, but (for) someone who doesn't regularly use cocaine and therefore doesn't have a tolerance for the drug, this would be a high level."" Houston's cocaine use appeared to have occurred ""in the time period just immediately prior to her collapse in the bathtub at the hotel,"" Chief Coroner Craig Harvey told reporters when he released the preliminary report last month. Investigators found ""a small spoon with a white crystal like substance in it and a rolled up piece of white paper"" in the bathroom where Houston drowned, coroner's investigator Kristy McCracken wrote. ""Remnants of a white powdery substance"" were found on a bathroom counter, McCracken wrote. ""I also collected remnants of a white powdery substance from out of a drawer and from the bottom of a mirror in the same drawer in the bathroom counter,"" she wrote. Detectives found a ""plethora of medications bottles"" in the hotel room, although the coroner concluded the prescription drugs  ""did not contribute to the death."" Along with cocaine, the toxicology tests found other drugs in her body, including marijuana, the anti-anxiety drug Xanax, the muscle relaxant Flexeril and the allergy medicine Benadryl, the report said. Houston was last seen alive by her personal assistant in her Beverly Hilton hotel room at about 3 p.m. that Saturday, the report said.  The assistant left to run errands after telling Houston to take a bath in preparation for a pre-Grammy Awards party at the hotel that night, it said. When the assistant returned to the locked room at 3:35 p.m., she found Houston ""lying face down in the bathtub filled with water, unresponsive."" ""The assistant called for her bodyguard, and together they pulled the decedent out of the bathtub,"" the report said. When paramedics arrived about 10 minutes later they moved Houston to the living room floor.  It was at 3:55 p.m., 20 minutes after she was found by the assistant, that paramedics concluded she was dead, the report said. Houston won six Grammys and sold 170 million albums, singles and videos over her career. In recent years, the singer's accomplishments were overtaken by her struggles with drug addiction.","A toxicologist says Houston's death could have stemmed from cardiac arrhythmia .

"Chuck Yeager retraced history on Sunday, 65 years to the minute, as the first test pilot to break the sound barrier, taking to the skies once again to fly faster than the speed of sound. The 89-year-old Yeager broke the sound barrier in a U.S. Air Force F-15 at 10:24 a.m. over the Mojave Desert, the same location where he first flew past Mach 1 on October 14, 1947, the military said in a statement. Yeager, flying in the F-15 with an Air Force captain, told CNN late Sunday that he hit Mach 1.3 and ""laid down a pretty good sonic boom over Edwards"" Air Force Base. Yeager's reenactment of his historic flight came the same day that Austrian Felix Baumgartner became the first person to break the sound barrier as a skydiver, jumping from a balloon at the edge of space to make the 23-mile journey. Not the only one to break the sound barrier this day . While Yeager's sound-breaking flight was news in military and aircraft manufacturing circles, his popularity soared when Tom Wolfe detailed Yeager's flight in the book ""The Right Stuff"" and its subsequent film adaptation. ""I really appreciated the Air Force giving me a brand new F-15 to fly,"" Yeager told CNN. Today, fighter jets can easily break the sound barrier. In fact, Yeager's flight Sunday did it at an altitude of about 33,000 feet, according to a statement provided by the Air Force. But in 1947, the golden age of flight, Yeager was dropped in an experimental rocket-propelled Bell X1 jet from a B-29 bomber at an altitude of 45,000 feet. ""That's the only way we could do it,"" he said. ""It took the British, French and the Soviet Union another five years to find out that trick. It gave us a quantum jump"" in aviation advancement, he said. On Sunday, Yeager took off from Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas in the second seat, the one behind the pilot, though he said he was flying the F-15 when it broke the sound barrier over Edwards. ""We had to keep it below Mach 1.4. If you want to go Mach 2, you start breaking glasses and cracking roofs,"" he said. But Yeager hardly sounded disappointed. His final aerial move, he told CNN, was a fly-by, buzzing the tower, at Nellis.","Chuck Yeager was the first test pilot to break the sound barrier .

"Some of Thomas Harte's New Hampshire neighbors are frustrated by the Affordable Care Act's insurance marketplaces but not for the reasons you might expect. Harte is an insurance broker. He still has his share of frustrations with the marketplace websites, but the growing number of complaints he hears come from clients and fellow brokers who have seen the policies these marketplaces offer. Nationally the marketplaces offer tens of thousands of different policies with a wide variety of coverage, but Harte has noticed many have one thing in common: They cover a narrow network of doctors and hospitals. Obamacare sign-up more than a phone call away . That narrower network comes as particularly bad news for the residents of Concord, New Hampshire. Concord's one hospital won't accept any policies offered by the marketplaces. To see a doctor, specialist or primary care provider affiliated with the hospital, patients on these Obamacare plans will have to pay out of their own pocket. The closest in-network hospital is in Manchester. ""Can you imagine having to go 25 miles away to Manchester to get access to a health care provider that is covered by your insurance?"" Harte asked. ""Right now, Concord is one big black hole of health care for people buying these plans."" HealthCaregov: What works, what doesn't . And it's not just Concord. Nationally, consumers are learning a number of well-known hospitals won't accept insurance offered through the marketplaces. In New York, NYU will accept only a minority of the plans. In Los Angeles, UCLA medical centers will accept a couple. In Atlanta, Emory has limited the number of plans it will take. Academic medical centers are often pricier because they tackle the more complex cases. WellPoint, a Blue Cross Blue Shield insurer offering policies in 14 states, is narrowing its networks in many markets after research showed consumers care more about the price than the provider. A survey done by PriceWaterhouse Cooper found that 43% of those surveyed considered the cost of the policy the most important factor when they pick a health insurance plan. What we learned -- and didn't -- from Obamacare website . But the picture isn't all bleak. ""Some coverage is better than no coverage,"" said Karen Davis, an economist and professor of health policy at Johns Hopkins University. Davis gives the ACA marketplaces high marks overall since it is a lot easier to compare plans in these marketplaces than when consumers were buying insurance on their own. With the standardized essential benefits offered by all plans, ""you can be a little bit more assured that Plan A and Plan B will provide decent coverage."" ""We're going to get better benefits in this market,"" said Jonathan Gruber, an economist at MIT who was an architect on both the Massachusetts and U.S. health plans. ""Right now, in this insurance market, not only is it discriminatory, but the typical person with an individual-payer plan has a very weak insurance plan. ... It's not real insurance. We're going to get rid of that -- everyone will have guaranteed, real insurance."" Obamacare open enrollment: Here's everything you need to know . In the case of Concord Hospital, the CEO and president wrote a letter to the local newspaper explaining that his hospital wasn't opting out of Obamacare as a ""political statement."" Instead, Michael B. Green blamed Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, the state exchange's only provider, for being ""unwilling to negotiate sustainable contract terms."" The hospital, he wrote, would be ""paid less than what it costs us to provide care,"" and said his advisers told him the facility should be cautious about ""committing to rates that could be detrimental to one's organization."" Concord is not the only New Hampshire city with a limited network of providers. Portsmouth's hospital isn't taking the insurance either. And only one of the two major hospitals in Nashua is in-network, according to Harte. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: 5 surprises from Sebelius interview . ""That's a big frustration to my clients who heard their President promise that if you like your doctor you can keep them,"" Harte said. ""Sure, you can keep them if you pay cash for their services. But if you want your new insurance to cover that doctor visit, forget it. You're going to have to switch."" In selling his health care plan to the nation, President Barack Obama did offer a ""guarantee"" that ""if you've got a doctor that you like, you will be able to keep your doctor."" The HealthCare.gov site is more specific in its section ""Can I keep my own doctor?"" It explains, ""Depending on the plan you choose in the Marketplace, you may be able to keep your current doctor. Different plans have different networks and providers."" ""May,"" of course, differs from a ""guarantee."" CNN Money: Doctor choice in Obamacare? Not so much . ""Across the board, the networks and the PPOs (preferred provider organizations) are significantly narrower than people are used to,"" said Micah Weinberg, a senior policy adviser dealing with health policies for California's Bay Area Council, a business-sponsored public policy advocacy group. ""Narrower networks is one way to keep costs (of these policies) down. Some of the networks may be too thin, at least for now anyway."" Provisions in the health care reform law say there has to be an adequate number of providers offered in these insurance networks. ""It still remains to be seen if that happens,"" said Davis of John Hopkins. ""In principle, you couldn't exclude all obstetricians, for instance. That plan would not be considered adequate."" As the marketplaces are around longer, more providers may opt into the system, according to Dr. Susan Turney, head of the Medical Group Management Association, a trade group that represents multiple physician medical practices. The hidden truth behind early Obamacare numbers . The group's survey of its members in September found that more than 40% were still deciding if they were going to accept the insurance offered through the ACA marketplaces. ""Many of the practices are still struggling to know what it means for them,"" Turney said. The association suggests that people who already have a doctor call to see if they will accept a particular policy. ""We know a number of our members have trained their staff to answer those kinds of questions."" If someone doesn't have a doctor, online resources can help with selecting one. While providers are limited with these plans, in the long run Davis said she believes ""it's actually a good thing to reward higher quality, lower cost providers"" as that could ultimately cut the cost of health care as the reform legislation intended. Doctor shortage, increased demand could crash health care system .","Insurers in Obamacare marketplaces providing fewer in-network doctors, experts say .

"The sixth suspect in the gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old woman is a minor and will be tried in juvenile court, police said Monday. The 17-year-old boy, whose name has not been released, was arrested by police in December and accused of taking part in the December 16 assault aboard a New Delhi bus. Police said the suspects attacked the woman and her male companion on a bus, robbed them and dumped them by the side of the road. The woman was badly injured in the attack. She died two weeks later after being flown to Singapore for treatment. The man survived. The five adult suspects are being tried in a ""fast-track"" court designed to bypass red tape. Hearings began last week, but details about what happens in court cannot be reported under a judge's ruling imposing restrictions on coverage of the case.

READ: Vine, Instagram and the rise of the bite-sized video . A Web version of MixBit and an app for Apple devices are now up and running. An Android version is expected to roll out before the end of September. With camera-equipped smartphones and tablets becoming nearly omnipresent, the past couple of years have seen a wave of quick video editing and uploading tools roll out. In addition to Twitter-owned Vine and Facebook's Instagram, which start as photo-only, apps like Viddy and Socialcam have sought to entice users increasingly accustomed to being able to create and share on the go. The key for MixBit, creators say, is encouraging collaborative creation, often among complete strangers. The app features easy-to-use editing tools that let users link up video clips as short as one second long. Up to 256 clips can be used in a video, which can be up to an hour long.

"For something that predicts the future, the software is deceptively simple looking. A map of a city is marked up with small red squares, each indicating a 500-by-500-foot zone where crimes are likely to take place next. A heat-map mode shows even more precisely where cars may be stolen, houses robbed, people mugged. The program is called PredPol, and it calculates its forecasts based on times and locations of previous crimes, combined with sociological information about criminal behavior and patterns. The technology has been beta tested in the Santa Cruz, California police department for the past year, and in an L.A. police precinct for the past six months, with promising results. Predictive-analytics software is the latest piece of policing technology working its way into law-enforcement stations around the country, although it's going up against tight budgets, bureaucracy and a culture still clinging to its analog ways. ""We had to try something because we were not being offered more cops,"" said Zach Friend, a crime analyst with the Santa Cruz Police Department. Last year, Friend contacted researchers working on the algorithm -- originally used for predicting earthquake aftershocks -- after reading an article in the LA Times. Gadgets to help you survive a power outage . At the time, his city had experienced a 30% increase in crime and a 20% decrease in police staff. He knew they had to try something. At first the Santa Cruz police department used the software to estimate where home, car and vehicle burglaries might take place, handing printouts of the maps to officers at the start of their shifts. Later it expanded it to bike thefts, battery, assault and prowling. The city has seen a 19% reduction in burglaries over the past year. While these kinds of experiments are promising, most police stations are still a far cry from the futuristic headquarters we see on TV shows like CSI. Real police departments lag behind your typical American teenager when it comes to technology -- some police cars still record video on VHS tapes, and it's not uncommon to fill out a police report on carbon paper. Last month, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee announced plans to develop a smartphone app that would allow officers to file police reports from the field. But SFPD chief information officer, Susan Giffin, told the Bay Citizen the department doesn't have the budget to buy smartphones on which to run the app. (San Francisco police officers only got e-mail addresses for the first time last year.) Thankfully for crime fighters, it's not all landlines, beepers and fax machines. Cool new crime-fighting technology is still being developed and tested by agencies around the country. There are gadgets such as Taser's small wearable cameras for police and other security professionals. The units can mount on a pair of Oakley sunglasses or a shirt collar, and they have accompanying Android and iOS apps. In Southern Florida, many police departments are using portable fingerprint scanners to ID suspects and bring up any outstanding warrants on the spot. The smartphone-sized devices cost $2,500 apiece. A ShotSpotter system uses microphones positioned around a city to detect gunshots and triangulate their location within 40 to 50 feet. A human at ShotSpotter's headquarters confirms if it's a gunshot and alerts the police. The system starts at $40,000 for every square mile of coverage. Some of the more widely adopted tech is decidedly low-budget. Police can Google suspects and check their Facebook profiles to gather information. Friend says the Santa Cruz department has had more luck posting photos of wanted suspects to the official department Facebook page than through traditional police channels. (The unusually tech-savvy department also has a Twitter account, blog, and YouTube channel.) Now predictive policing software is picking up steam, thanks to a few well-publicized test cases, low overhead and impressive drops in crime rates that, while they can't be directly tied to any one initiative, bode well for the maps.

PredPol is new to the field, but IBM has been testing predictive policing software since 2010, using databases of past crimes and information like timing and weather to identify trends and map out predictions. The company has worked with police departments in Memphis, New York City, and most recently Charleston, South Carolina. A final hurdle for all types of new technology is getting the officers themselves to adopt and use it. ""Law enforcement agencies historically are conservative in their approach to change. That includes to adopting all kinds of technology, from computers in the cars to even radios,"" said Friend. A new generation of police who have grown up immersed in technology will likely help ease the transition by communicating to older officers that the new tools only enhance what they already know. Seasoned patrol cops rely on their instincts, developed over years of experience walking the same streets and patrolling familiar neighborhoods. Experts say this new technology can cut down on paperwork and make policing more efficient so the police can focus on what they do best. ""It doesn't replace what they do,"" said Friend of PredPol. ""When they get into those locations, they still need to be good cops."" Report: Next Kindle Fire will have camera, sharper display .","Predictive analytic software PredPol anticipates future crime based upon past activity.
The program was adapted from similar software meant to predict earthquake aftershocks.
Many police stations still use obsolete technology due to small budgets and aversion to change.
Even so, police depend heavily upon social media to solve crimes."
"The escalation in recent days of eastern Congo's brutal war demonstrates that unless its root causes are addressed in a broader peace process, violence could intensify and Rwanda could be drawn more directly into the fray, regionalizing the war. Over the past week, Congo's army has nearly militarily defeated the most powerful rebel group, the M23. Rwanda has threatened to strike Congo in retaliation for what it claims was shelling on its territory by Congo's army. M23 may soon be a spent force militarily, but many other armed groups are still active and could replace it as major destabilizers of eastern Congo unless the root causes of the war are addressed. Recently suspended talks in Uganda only involve the Congolese government and M23, and address none of the underlying political, economic, or security drivers of violence that have created the deadliest conflict globally since World War II. Corrupt governance, intercommunal divisions and illegal exploitation of lucrative natural resources allow the Congolese army and a host of predatory militias to operate with impunity.  But the most important factor in ending mass violence is the Congo-Rwanda relationship and the economic and security interests that underlie it. The fates of Rwanda and Congo are deeply intertwined. The aftermath of the Rwandan genocide spilled over into Congo in the mid-1990s, acting like gasoline on the fire of preexisting ethnic tensions, localized conflict and state collapse. Since then, Rwanda's periodic direct intervention and support for armed groups in eastern Congo have been central drivers of continuing conflict. Remarkably, however, no major international peace initiative has comprehensively analyzed and addressed Rwanda's core interests as part of a solution. Rwandan security interests in Congo center on containing the threat posed by the Congo-based armed group, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), whose leaders participated in the 1994 genocide against Rwandan Tutsis. Congo's army has at times supported the FDLR. The Rwandan government, which defeated the regime that committed the genocide, believes that as long as the FDLR is in Congo with supporters around the world motivated by a genocidal ideology, it represents a threat. Rwanda also has economic interests in Congo in natural resources, land and cross-border trade. Rwanda has its own domestic minerals sector but benefited significantly from smuggled conflict minerals from Congo -- in particular tin, tantalum, and tungsten -- for several years.  According to numerous U.N. investigative reports, some Rwandan traders have relabeled Congolese minerals as Rwandan and exported them. Rwanda is reliant on the minerals trade to reduce its significant balance of trade deficit. Widely divergent opinions focus on Rwandan President Paul Kagame. Supporters cite his ending the 1994 genocide and tout the country's dramatic economic recovery since then, but are uncritical of Rwanda's role in Congo or the lack of internal political freedom. Critics focus only on its destructive behavior in Congo and repressive policies at home but overlook the progress Rwanda has made in other spheres. The ""11+4 Framework"" for a peace initiative signed by all the governments in the region provides a new window to address the core causes of the conflict and involve civil society. The appointments of Mary Robinson and Russ Feingold as U.N. and U.S. envoys, respectively, further improve the odds. The primary key to ending the violence is changing the economic incentives from war to peace and addressing regional security threats. This in no way diminishes the urgent need for political reforms in Kigali, Kinshasa, and elsewhere in the region, as well as the importance of placing targeted sanctions against any officials supporting armed groups, combating spoiler militias like the FDLR and M23 by buttressing the U.N. Intervention Brigade's capacities and prosecuting war crimes. But the most promising opportunity for peace is in the economic interdependence between Congo and Rwanda.  The perceived zero-sum nature of Rwanda's interests that help fuel the war has to be transformed for the war to end. If the mineral sector alone was developed by serious investment in conflict-free, transparent semi-industrial and industrial mining, and the artisanal trade was more formalized with better equipment and fair-trade small-scale mining, there would be a greatly expanded economic pie for the entire region. Instead of the current fighting over surface-level minerals left to armed smugglers, there could be exponentially larger revenues for both countries and wealth-building opportunities for Congolese communities from the deeper mines in a legal, peaceful trade. The envoys can help by pressing to finalize the regional minerals certification process and asking the World Bank to accelerate its regional infrastructure programs. Rwanda and Congo can grow together if Rwanda becomes a gateway for international businesses to invest in Congo's natural resource sector, while attracting investors on the basis of good roads, electricity, transparent business regulations and banking institutions. Singapore grew similarly by attracting investors interested in neighboring Indonesia's and Malaysia's natural resources. All three countries benefited tremendously from this arrangement: Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore are now all in the top 20% of world economies. Congo and Rwanda may not be top 20 candidates soon, but a peaceful sub-region would be a good start.","Authors: Unless root causes are addressed, violence will intensify in Congo .

"Throngs of people weighed in on the Chick-fil-A debate at stores across the United States on Wednesday, buying chicken sandwiches to show their support for the restaurant chain and its president's opposition to same-sex marriage. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee dubbed it ""Chick-fil-A  Appreciation Day."" He called for a vocal response to the backlash against the fast food restaurants and their president. Eat Mor Chikin: Chick-fil-A's stance on same-sex marriage faces test . The controversy started after an interview with the fast food restaurant chain's president and COO, Dan Cathy, appeared in The Baptist Press on July 16. He weighed in with his views on family. ""We are very much supportive of the family -- the biblical definition of the family unit,"" Cathy said. ""We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that."" On a Facebook page Huckabee created announcing the event, more than 620,000 people said they would participate. ""The goal is simple: Let's affirm a business that operates on Christian principles and whose executives are willing to take a stand for the godly values we espouse by simply showing up and eating at Chick Fil-A on Wednesday, August 1,"" wrote Huckabee, a former pastor. Lines snaked around a Chick-fil-A in Dallas, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. Patrons packed a Chick-fil-A in Smyrna, Georgia. A food court with a Chick-fil-A was flooded in Laurel, Mississippi. On Facebook, fans posted photos of themselves holding bags emblazoned with the restaurant chain's bright red logo. Edwin Guzman told CNN's iReport that he waited about 30 minutes for his lunch at a ""crazy packed"" Chick-fil-A in Clarksville, Tennessee. ""It's really hard to find people or leaders that stand for something good and stay firm,"" he said of the restaurant chain. In Barboursville, West Virginia, Brett Walker said, ""the scene at Chick-fil-A seemed like a massive silent protest."" Walker told iReport he chose to eat at the restaurant Wednesday ""in support of free speech"" and waited 40 minutes to receive his order. Have you seen demonstrations at restaurants in your area? A police officer directed traffic as cars jammed the area, and employees walked car to car in the drive-thru line to take orders, he said. Roger Cates told iReport he had lunch at Chick-fil-A in Owensboro, Kentucky, and planned to return with his family for dinner. Political leaders who have criticized the chain, like the mayors of Boston and Chicago, are hypocritical, he said. ""I think it is ironic that the so-called forces of tolerance and inclusion are calling for the exclusion of Chick-fil-A from cities simply because of the beliefs of their chairman. ... People that disagree with me have a right to their opinion, and I have a right to mine,"" he said. In Oklahoma, Tim Tibbles told iReport that many braved hot weather to show their support for the restaurant. ""It's 109 degrees here, and people have been standing outside for well over an hour. Nobody is complaining or talking about the controversy. They're showing quiet support,"" he said. Andy Kives drove 45 minutes each way Wednesday morning to get breakfast for his employees. The Blairsville, Georgia, resident told iReport he doesn't care about the issue of same-sex marriage but felt compelled to support Chick-fil-A because ""it's an uber-successful privately held corporation"" that ""happened to take a public stand against a topic that the liberal media chooses to champion."" In the Atlanta area, CNN affiliate WSB warned of traffic delays around Chick-fil-As. Wendy Neill of Searcy, Arkansas, told iReport she brought her two daughters, ages 12 and 14, with her to Chick-fil-A on Wednesday. ""It was good for them to see (that) this is what it means to be an American, and we have free speech, and when we want to make a statement, we can make it,"" she said. Support extended beyond the restaurant chain. Some Wendy's franchises in North and South Carolina weighed in Wednesday morning with signs outside their restaurants saying, ""We Stand With Chick-fil-A."" ""Too often, those on the left make corporate statements to show support for same-sex marriage, abortion, or profanity, but if Christians affirm traditional values, we're considered homophobic, fundamentalists, hate-mongers, and intolerant,"" Huckabee said on the Facebook page, adding that neither the company nor the Cathy family was involved in proposing or promoting the event. A vice president of the company said the day was not created by Chick-fil-A. ""We appreciate all of our customers and are glad to serve them at any time,""  Steve Robinson said in a statement. ""Our goal is simple: to provide great food, genuine hospitality and to have a positive influence on all who come into contact with Chick-fil-A."" He declined to comment on sales figures or volume, saying  Chick-fil-A is a privately held company. Proponents of same-sex marriage organized a simple counterprotest for Wednesday, asking people to donate the approximate cost of a Chick-fil-A meal, about $6.50, to gay and lesbian rights groups, according to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, known as GLAAD. The organization is backing a ""National Same-Sex Kiss Day"" to be held Friday at Chick-fil-A restaurants nationwide, encouraging participants to post photos to the Internet.

"Reacting to ""feedback from the Xbox community,"" Microsoft is appearing to reverse course and change two key components to policies for its new Xbox One video game console. All disc-based games can be played without ever connecting online, and the 24-hour connection requirement has been dropped, according to an update to a May post concerning questions about the new device, due to be released this fall. Additionally, there will be no limitations to using and sharing games, Don Mattrick, president of the Interactive Entertainment Business division, says in the post. People will be able to share, trade or resell their games in the same way they do for Xbox 360 games. The changes indicate Microsoft is having second thoughts about some of its future plans with the Xbox One. The post read, ""Update on June 19, 2013: As a result of feedback from the Xbox community, we have changed certain policies for Xbox One reflected in this blog. Some of this information is no longer accurate."" The company has been taking a public berating since it announced restrictions to used games and their requirement for an Internet connection. Consumers have been reacting with anger over the policies, but the tipping point may have been when Jimmy Fallon, host of NBC's ""Late Night,"" pointed out that only the PlayStation 4 could freely play used games, which created more confusion. The flogging became worse when Sony took to the stage at this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) trade show and pointedly did not include such restrictions for the new PlayStation 4. A YouTube video produced by Sony made fun of the used-game restriction by showing how people could share games on the PlayStation 4 -- by just handing them to another person. Fans air concerns about new PlayStation, Xbox . The new Xbox One used-games policy only affects disc-based games. Titles downloaded through Xbox Live cannot be shared or resold. Also, disc-based games must have the disc inside the console to play. The changes being made also affect its proposed family sharing policy. Since Microsoft is allowing players to have the flexibility to use games offline, it will not be launching its family sharing plan, which would have allowed up to 10 family members to log in and play games from anywhere. However, Marc Whitten, chief product officer for Xbox, told CNN the company still believes very deeply in its digital vision. ""So much of what we've built around our digital ecosystem still works,"" Whitten said. ""It's what we building in how you can use your games. Our online vision and the Xbox One architecture really power the complete new experience in how the Cloud changes everything and we're massively invested in this."" He also said the flexibility the company added for physical-disc play will not change for the life of the Xbox One. Whitten said there are no changes surrounding the addition of Kinect with the Xbox One. He said the company believes the motion sensor/controller is critical to building out the next generation experiences gamers are craving. The Xbox One will cost about $100 more than Sony's PlayStation 4 ($499 versus $399), but officials at the Redmond, Washington-based company believe their console will be worth the value. ""While we believe that the majority of people will play games online and access the cloud for both games and entertainment, we will give consumers the choice of both physical and digital content,"" Whitten wrote in the blog post. ""We have listened and we have heard loud and clear from your feedback that you want the best of both worlds.""

"Actress Angelina Jolie announced in a New York Times op-ed article on Tuesday that she underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning that she carries a mutation of the BRCA1 gene, which sharply increases her risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. ""My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman,"" Jolie wrote. ""Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much I could. I made a decision to have a preventive double mastectomy."" Five reasons we love Angelina Jolie . Jolie's mother, actress and producer Marcheline Bertrand, died of ovarian cancer in 2007 at the age of 56.  Jolie is 37 years old. In the Times op-ed, titled ""My Medical Choice,"" Jolie said she finished three months of medical procedures at the Pink Lotus Breast Center in California on April 27 that included the mastectomies and reconstruction. Opinion: Jolie's choice carries risks with benefits . A mastectomy is an operation that removes all or part of the breast. She wrote that her experience involved a three-step process. On February 2, the actress had a procedure that increases the chance that the nipple can be saved. Two weeks later, she had major surgery where the breast tissue was removed and temporary fillers were put in place. Nine weeks later, she described undergoing ""reconstruction of the breasts with an implant."" ""There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years,"" she said, ""and the results can be beautiful."" Why double mastectomies are up . ""I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a mastectomy was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made,"" Jolie wrote. ""My chances of developing breast cancer have dropped from 87 percent to under 5 percent."" BRCA stands for breast cancer susceptibility genes, a class of genes known as tumor suppressors, according to the National Cancer Institute. Hollywood applauds Jolie for going public with surgery . Mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. A blood test can determine if a woman is ""highly susceptible"" to the cancers. Fellow actress Christina Applegate had a similar procedure in 2008. She also had a mutation of the BRCA1 gene. My preventive mastectomy: Staying alive for my kids . Jolie may be best known for title role in the ""Lara Croft"" series of films, but she also won an Academy Award for best supporting actress in ""Girl, Interrupted."" She also received a Golden Globe Award and SAG Award for the same role. Opinion: Jolie's brave message . Jolie serves as a special envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and has visited refugee camps around the world. The actress has been in a relationship with actor Brad Pitt since the mid-2000s, and they are engaged. The couple has three biological and three adopted children. In telling her story, Jolie acknowledged that surgery might not be the right choice for every woman. Tough choices in cancer gene fight . ""For any woman reading this, I hope it helps you to know you have options,"" Jolie wrote. ""I want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices."" But for Jolie, the decision ultimately came down to her kids. ""I can tell my children that they don't need to fear they will lose me to breast cancer,"" she said. iReporters: BRCA gene not a death sentence .","A blood test can detect if a woman is ""highly susceptible"" to breast or ovarian cancer .

"More than a decade after that dreadful day, 9/11 memories are still fresh for me. The intense, flesh-cutting urgency of the pain has diminished. I am no longer a grieving mother. I have learned to live with the loss of my son, Mohammad Salman Hamdani. But I am still waiting for justice. What I want is not complicated -- a recognition that, when Salman died beneath the rubble that day, he died as a first responder. His name should be reflected that way at the 9/11 Memorial, properly listed among the other first responders who rushed bravely toward the flames. On that terrible day, my husband Saleem and I could not know where Salman was. Nor could his brothers, Adnaan and Zeshan, know what had become of their Bhaijaan, the Urdu word for a beloved and revered elder brother. As anyone who lost a loved one on 9/11 knows, that uncertainty was cruel and crushing. We couldn't know it then, but what had happened to Salman that morning, along with the events of the following months, changed everything for our family, bringing unbearable pain into our lives and suddenly making us public persons. In the months before 9/11, Salman had served as a cadet in the New York Police Department. He was also a trained emergency technician. At the time of his death, he was working as a lab analyst at Rockefeller University's Howard Hughes Medical Institute, on Manhattan's Upper East Side. He was working there because it was a path toward becoming a doctor. Salman was determined to keep trying to get into medical school. If he couldn't, he planned to join the NYPD and work toward becoming a detective, using his scientific skills. It was a momentous time of decision in his life. Opinion: After 9/11, how we honored our son's memory . On that crisp and glorious morning, I drove away from our home in Bayside, Queens. I dropped off Zeshan at Queensborough Community College, then continued on to Catherine & Count Basie Middle School 72, where I taught English. When Zeshan and I left the house, at about 7:15, Salman was still sleeping. He had been up much of the evening, first polishing up his medical school application, then providing medical care to his father, who was feeling ill. Finally, Salman went up to bed at 3 a.m. in the bedroom he shared with Zeshan. After Zeshan and I had left, Salman would have pursued his usual routine, catching a bus and then the 7 train to Manhattan. As we have since deduced, he must have seen the flames at the World Trade Center from the elevated train, then rushed downtown to try to help. Clearly, he did not make that decision and take that fatal detour as a lab analyst, but as the first responder he was trained to be. In the months that followed, in addition to uncertainty about Salman, our family had to endure suspicion pointed at him. Before anyone knew where he was, a flyer circulated around the city, saying that my son was wanted for questioning. And the New York Post ran a story with Salman's photo and this hateful headline: ""Missing -- Or Hiding?"" It wasn't until late March that the police told us that Salman's remains had been found beneath the pile -- in 34 pieces. Ultimately, what we would get to bury was nothing more than a body bag filled with all that was left of our son. At Salman's funeral, the many mourners included Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and our congressman, Gary Ackerman. The Patriot Act, enacted in response to the terror attacks, specifically refers to Salman as a 9/11 hero. Yet, at the 9/11 Memorial, his name is grouped among the miscellaneous victims, not among the first responders who sacrificed their lives, where it belongs. Salman responded to the call of duty, transcending the barriers of race, faith and ethnicity. Yet, sadly, he is not getting his due place in history. Salman is not here to defend himself. But I will speak for him. He is my strength, and I am his voice.","Talat Hamdani: My son, Mohammad Salman Hamdani, was killed on 9/11 .

"Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has signed into law a bill that toughens penalties against gay people and defines some homosexual acts as crimes punishable by life in prison. Homosexual acts are already illegal in Uganda, and Museveni had gone back and forth recently about whether he would sign the controversial bill in the face of vocal opposition from the West. At the public signing of the bill Monday, a defiant Museveni declared that he would not allow the West to impose its values on Uganda. ""We have been disappointed for a long time by the conduct of the West, the way you conduct yourselves there,"" he told CNN's Zain Verjee in Entebbe. ""Our disappointment is now exacerbated because we are sorry to see that you live the way you live, but we keep quiet about it.  Now you say 'you must also live like us' -- that's where we say no."" The bill, introduced first in 2009, originally included a death penalty clause for some homosexual acts. It was briefly shelved when Britain and other European nations threatened to withdraw aid to Uganda, which relies on millions of dollars from the international community. The nation's parliament passed the bill in December, replacing the death penalty provision with a proposal of life in prison for ""aggravated homosexuality."" This includes acts in which one person is infected with HIV, ""serial offenders"" and sex with minors, according to Amnesty International. The bill also proposed years in prison for anyone who counsels or reaches out to gays and lesbians, a provision that would ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Museveni's position on the law changed several times since lawmakers passed it late last year. In January he said he wouldn't sign the bill, describing homosexuals as ""sick"" people who needed help, not imprisonment. But he backtracked this month and said he'd sign it because scientists had determined that there is no gene for homosexuality and that it is merely a choice to embrace abnormal behavior. ""It was learned and could be unlearned,"" Museveni said. Shortly after his announcement, U.S. President Barack Obama warned that enacting the bill would affect relations between the two nations. He described the proposal as an ""affront and a danger to the gay community"" in Uganda. The U.S. is among the nation's largest donors. On Monday, Museveni rejected the suggestion that the new laws were a step back for Uganda and said he wasn't concerned about the West's perception of his country. ""Worried? Not at all,"" he told CNN. ""If the West doesn't want to work with us because of homosexuals, then we have enough space here to live by ourselves and do business with other people."" ""We see how you do things, the families, how they're organized. All the things, we see them, we keep quiet,"" he said. ""It's not our country, maybe you like it.  So there's now an attempt at social imperialism -- to impose social values of one group on our society."" Homosexuality in Africa . Homosexuality is illegal in 38 African countries, where most sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. In Uganda, homosexual acts were punishable by 14 years to life in prison even before the controversial bill was signed into law. Lawmakers in the conservative nation sought tougher legislation, saying the influence of Western lifestyles risked destroying family units. Rights groups worldwide have condemned the bill as draconian.","Museveni signs bill that could mean life in prison for ""aggravated homosexuality""

"When traveling through space, there are certain items you know you're going to need. A spacesuit? Most likely. A towel? Some say it's the most massively useful item you can have. For all the rest, NASA has a new plan: 3-D printers. In space. The agency plans to send a 3-D printer to the International Space Station in June, when the fifth SpaceX supply mission is scheduled. In a video published Monday, the agency explains that a functional 3-D printer would help astronauts keep a steady supply of all the little parts needed to keep the 15-year-old station in working order without having to deliver or find storage space for replacements. ""3-D printing provides us the ability to do our own 'Star Trek' replication right there on the spot,"" NASA astronaut Timothy ""T.J."" Creamer says in the video. The printer would ""help us replace things we've lost, replace things we've broken or maybe make things that we've thought of that would be useful."" NASA will be able to load software for items it knows the astronauts will need onto the printer beforehand but also will be able to upload new ones from Earth if needed. A model of the proposed 3-D printer, from private company Made In Space, recently passed a battery of tests at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Chief among the questions addressed: whether the printer can withstand the pressure of a launch and how it would perform in ""micro-gravity"" aboard the space station. ""The 3D printing experiment with NASA is a step towards the future,"" Made In Space CEO Aaron Kemmer said in a news release when the partnership was announced. ""The ability to 3D-print parts and tools on demand greatly increases the reliability and safety of space missions while also dropping the cost by orders of magnitude."" Niki Werkheiser, NASA's point person on the project, said 3-D printing will significantly improve efficiency and convenience for astronauts. ""As you might imagine on Space Station, whatever you have available in orbit is what they have to use,"" she said. ""Just like on the ground, you have parts that break or get lost. When that happens, you do have to wait for replacement parts, or we have to use multiple spares that have to be launched -- which does require extra mass."" So what types of things could easily be lost and reproduced on the printer? In the video, Creamer mentions tools used on the space station and small pieces of storage racks used to anchor them down. But a 3-D printer could also be used to replicate more ambitious items in space -- someday, maybe even a pizza.","NASA plans to launch a 3-D printer to the International Space Station .

"At a coming-out party for its upcoming PlayStation 4 console, Sony leveled its guns at rival Microsoft's Xbox One device and fired until the chambers were empty. During a press event Monday night at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, Sony hammered home key points about its new gaming system: Sharing games will be free. If people want to sell used games, that's fine. And a near-constant Internet connection, meant to monitor game usage, won't be required. In other words, the PS4 will do many things the new XBox apparently cannot. Oh, and the PlayStation 4 will sell for $399 -- $100 less than the Xbox One. Both consoles are expected this fall in time for the holiday shopping season, setting up a battle for the hearts, minds and wallets of the gaming community. A big point of contention among gamers is that Microsoft's new Xbox will require an online check-in every 24 hours (less than the ""always-on"" mode gamers expected) and will only allow games to be resold at selected retailers. Games may be shared only among a limited number of friends and family members. Microsoft's daily check-in is designed, in part, to make sure users haven't resold, traded in or given away a game they've already downloaded on their consoles. The idea is to prevent more than one person from effectively owning a game that was purchased only once. After rolling out a list of new games, Jack Tretton, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America, essentially went down a laundry list of complaints about the new Xbox, which had been showcased earlier Monday, and promised the opposite. ""In addition to creating an amazing library of new titles on PlayStation 4, we're equally focused on delivering what gamers want most without imposing restrictions or devaluing their PS4 purchases,"" Tretton said. ""For instance, PlayStation 4 won't impose any new restrictions on the use of pre-owned games."" That announcement got a loud and sustained round of applause from an E3 crowd not always easy to impress. ""I guess that's a good thing,"" a smiling Tretton replied. In game-console terms, digital-rights management is a code that allows users to access a game's content. It's designed to assure developers and publishers that only the person who paid for the game, and close family and friends, can play it. Sony and Microsoft aren't the ones that would benefit from DRM, or used-game restrictions. Game publishers want to make sure they are getting paid for their work, and that includes the secondhand market. In the weeks leading up to E3, Microsoft had sought to calm gamers' concerns with a series of blog posts that some felt nibbled around the edges of rights-management issues but never offered definitive answers. Sony then was conspicuously quiet in what, now, appears to have been an orchestrated effort to lower the boom at E3. Witness the ""Official PlayStation Used Game Instructional Video"" released shortly after the presentation. It's 22 seconds long and features only ""Step 1,"" a man handing a disc to another man. That cheeky video had racked up more than 1.5 million views on YouTube in less than 24 hours. Microsoft did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request seeking comment. But online pundits were quick to praise Sony for landing some blows against its rival. ""As crude as it is to declare a company the 'winner' of E3, it's hard to see Sony's presentation today as anything but a PR coup ... ,"" Kyle Orland, senior gaming editor at CNN content partner Ars Technica, wrote Monday. ""Among some of the most influential and hardest-to-please gamers on the Internet, Sony is now the savior company that can do no wrong. They should enjoy the ride, which will last just as long as it takes for them to do something wrong."" Writing for Time, Jared Newman takes a longer view. Sony's move is meant to preserve the future of disc-based games, at least for now, while Microsoft stands ready to kill discs entirely, moving to an almost entirely digital model, he said. Playing to what's already comfortable for gamers was clearly part of Sony's strategy, Newman said.

"A fire that swept through a Bronx apartment killing three young brothers was caused by a candle and occurred one day after the power company cut off electricity for unpaid bills, officials said Saturday. A neighbor said she was in her apartment in the building on West 165th Street -- half a mile from Yankee Stadium -- when she heard the boys' mother, Tashika Turner, screaming ""Fire!"" ""She was yelling out the window,"" Cynthia Woods told CNN affiliate NY1. ""She saw me and said, 'Fire!' So I ran upstairs to the apartment and I kicked the door open. ""I tried to go in and get the kids, because I could hear the kids hollering. But the fire was like real heavy, so I fell, and I couldn't get into the house to save the kids ... And I couldn't get them. I couldn't get the kids out. I heard them crying, and they were burning. I couldn't get them. I couldn't get them out. I tried."" Woods said she kicked the door so hard she fell back. When she finally forced it open, ""the fire came out -- and all I could hear is them hollering. And I tried to go in, but I couldn't go in. There was so much smoke and fire. It was a big flame. The whole front, the kitchen, everything was on fire."" It took about 100 firefighters about 90 minutes to bring the two-alarm fire under control by 9:30 p.m. Friday in the six-story building, officials said. By then, it was too late. The boys -- Elijah Artis, 5; Jeremiah Artis, 2; and Michael Turner, 4 months -- were declared dead on arrival at Lincoln Medical Center, police said. Hospital spokeswoman Nydia Negron said two children -- sisters ages 4 and 4 months -- were in stable condition in the intensive care unit; the mother was treated and released. Their mother -- whom Negron identified as Tashika Turner -- survived, too. Fire marshals have determined the fire was accidentally ""caused by a candle in the kitchen,"" FDNY spokesman Daniel Glover said. Con Ed spokesman Allan Drury explained that the apartment's residents owed ""a significant amount ... -- well into the thousands of dollars."" ""We try to avoid turning service off to customers,"" Drury added. ""We'll put them on payment plans to work with them to avoid turnoff, but this account had substantial arrears."" The fire occurred 180 feet from 1022 Woodycrest Avenue, a four-story building that caught fire in March 2007 when a space heater cord overheated, killing 10 people, nine of them children. At the time, Mayor Michael Bloomberg called it the worst fire in New York City since the Happy Land social club -- also in the Bronx -- went up in flames in 1990, killing 87 people.

"Heather Kern's heart had raced ever since she was 11. It would randomly speed up at times and then drop back to normal. But those quirks didn't stop her from lacing up her boots for a hike every weekend or jumping in the pool for a long swim -- at least until she gave birth to her little girl in August 2008. That's when her heart changed. Two weeks after delivering her daughter Cindy, Kern realized something was very wrong. The 32-year-old began experiencing numbness in her limbs and had severe chest pain. ""My heart felt like a Ping-Pong ball -- it was going crazy speeding up and slowing down,"" she remembers. Kern went to see a cardiologist in their new home state of Texas. She didn't know what to expect; for years doctors had shrugged off her symptoms. She was stunned to learn that her problems were caused by heart disease. The new mother had a left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy, a congenital disorder that affects a small percentage of people. With LVNC, muscle fibers in the lower left chamber of the heart do not turn into solid muscle as they should during normal development. Instead the fibers remain and interfere with the heart's function. Kern's cardiologist suspected that she also had Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia, an abnormal heart rhythm disorder that could potentially cause sudden cardiac arrest. The diagnosis sent her into a spiral of depression. ""I thought I was going to die,"" she says. She had already put on 40 pounds during pregnancy and was now being told she couldn't do anything active that would strain her heart. Life became a series of tests and checkups, shuffling in and out of the hospital. She had to get an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implanted, and was put on heart medication to regulate her life-threatening arrhythmias.  Eventually, Kern started seeing a counselor to deal with the emotional pain. ""That first year with my daughter, I couldn't enjoy her because I was having problems, and I was sick,"" she says. As she tried to cope with her new reality, she turned to food. Over the next four years, her weight ballooned. Food, inactivity and even her heart medicine caused her to put on weight. And her growing waistline was not helping her self esteem. She became so heavy she couldn't bear to step on the scale and refused to pose in photographs with friends. At the start of 2012, she came across a weight-loss challenge on a couponing website. The challenge was between a group of strangers online who counted calories to lose weight. It didn't seem like something that would strain her heart, so Kern decided to join the group's challenge. ""I thought I'd try losing weight with people online. I figured if I fail it's not as bad because I don't really know them,"" she says. So she cut her food intake by 500 calories a day, eating only 1,200 calories and religiously documented everything she put in her mouth. A chocolate lover, she got rid of all candy from her house. And she stopped eating after her daughter. ""Oh the French fries -- my kid with her Happy Meals would drive me crazy,"" she says. ""I would eat half her meal because she couldn't finish it."" But with calorie counting, there was no room for extra food. She weighed in at 260 pounds at the start of the challenge. In six weeks she had dropped 20 pounds, winning the weight-loss competition. It was a boost of confidence that motivated her to take control of her life. She was determined to get to a healthy weight not only for herself, but also for her daughter. ""My mom and grandfather both died in their forties because of this, and they didn't know they had heart disease,"" she said. ""A lot of people have the same kind of thing I have. It's like a totally different ball game when you're trying to lose weight."" She made counting calories a routine, logging her intake on sites like caloriecount.com or on her mobile phone. But she wanted to do more. She wanted to be active but didn't know how. She asked her cardiologist about light exercise; he thought it would be a good idea to try. So Kern strapped on her tennis shoes and put Cindy in a stroller and walked down the street. That was as far as she would go. The fear that her heart would act up made her turn around. But those first few steps were just the beginning. She slowly built the courage to walk a little further each day around her neighborhood, paying close attention to her body. Soon, she was able to jump on the elliptical for five minutes at a time, building up her endurance. ""You got to go slowly,"" she says. Losing weight was gradual for Kern, who is 5'8"". It took her two years to reach her goal weight of 135 pounds on October 2013. Kern, who started a new job at a patient advocacy company, now focuses on maintaining her weight. She joined a gym to build muscle and goes every day. She still lives with her heart condition, but losing the weight has helped keep her heath in check. ""Some days I go to the gym and my heart isn't cooperating. It feels like it is rattling around,"" she says. ""You never push yourself with this disease. They tell you to push yourself at the gym, but you have to listen to your body."" Kern currently takes only half her heart medication. Her cardiologist attributes her improved health to her weight loss. She says the entire process changed the way she views life. ""When I was diagnosed with heart disease, I literally thought that my life was over,"" she said. ""But the huge weight-loss proved to me I could still do what I set my mind to. Life wasn't over; it could be wonderful.""","When Heather Kern was diagnosed with congenital heart disease her life changed .

"Chris Kelly, half of the 1990s rap duo Kris Kross, died of a drug overdose that included heroin and cocaine, his autopsy report said Wednesday. Kelly, 34, died at an Atlanta hospital after he was found unresponsive at his home on May 1, police said. The Fulton County medical examiner concluded that Kelly's death was an accident caused by the combined toxic effects of heroin, cocaine, ethanol and hydrocodone, and alprazolam, said the medical examiner's spokeswoman, Karleshia Bentley. After paramedics took him to the hospital, a woman who identified herself as Kelly's friend told an investigator that Kelly had taken a mixture of heroin and cocaine the night before, and that she had brought Kelly home ""to recover from his drug use,"" according to a police report. Kelly, together with Chris Smith, shot to stardom in 1992 with ""Jump,"" which spent eight weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100. The duo opened for Michael Jackson that year on his Dangerous World Tour. Their penchant for wearing their clothes backward was, at least for a time, widely emulated. Discovered at a mall . Kelly and Smith were 13-year-olds when they were discovered in 1991 at an Atlanta mall by producer Jermaine Dupri. Going by the stage name Mac Daddy (with Smith known as Daddy Mac), the pair followed up their smash ""Jump"" with the single ""Warm It Up."" Together, the songs pushed their debut album, ""Totally Krossed Out,"" to multiplatinum status. Next came 1993's ""Da Bomb."" But the album failed to find the following of the duo's debut, in large part because the boys had hit puberty and they were marketed with a tougher image. Their career never again reached the heights of their debut, but they continued to make music. In 1996, the duo released the album ""Young, Rich and Dangerous.""

"In the end, a coupon changed Torrie Creamer's life. Years of New Year's resolutions hadn't done it. Her son's probing questions about her ""still pregnant"" belly hadn't done it. Hurtful comments from a friend about another obese woman at a ballgame had only primed her desire to lose weight. Then the LivingSocial deal arrived in her inbox. For $25, she could take four weeks of classes at a women's fitness boot camp. And after the incident at the ballpark, Creamer was ready to try just about anything. Learn more about Creamer's journey in her own words . The Norfolk, Virginia, resident had been steadily gaining weight since she married her high school sweetheart Jason more than 10 years before. Each kid -- Jordan, then Gabriel, then Kameron -- added extra pounds she couldn't seem to shake. By 2011, she was 5-foot-11 and weighed 322 pounds. Boot camps have become popular in the fitness community over the past decade, earning praise for their focus on high-intensity intervals and body weight exercises. Trainer Ken Williams started Bootcamp for Women - Body by Ken with five members in May 2002. By July, it was standing room only. Walking toward the beach for her first workout, Creamer spotted women running back and forth in the sand. She hesitantly joined in and promptly fell down. It took three male trainers to pick her back up. Creamer left the class crying. But the next day she returned, and she continued to go to every class for the next four weeks. ""I was always the last runner in, or in my case, the last walker in,"" she says. ""I could not do push-ups. I could not finish a routine without feeling like I was dying and about to vomit. But somehow I made it there."" She lost 15 pounds in four weeks and told Williams she was coming back. The next day Creamer found out she had been laid off from her job. She left a message for Williams saying she couldn't afford the program without a steady income and figured that was that. But that night she got a phone call from someone in the group. The women talked and were going to chip in so Creamer could continue to work out. ""I sat on my porch thinking to myself, 'These people don't know me,'"" Creamer says. ""At that moment I made the promise to myself... if these people were not letting me fail, then how can I let myself fail?"" Creamer committed to 12 more weeks of boot camp. Each week it got easier for her to complete Williams' grueling workout. She continually increased her goals and spoke with Williams about changes she could make when she hit a plateau. When the 12 weeks were over, she came back again. ""Everyday she came I could see her giving 100%,"" Williams says. ""That's the thing I saw different in her. When you put that in your head, when you put that in your mind, when you have that attitude -- you can't help but be successful."" Creamer also overhauled her diet. She used to eat a bowl of ice cream every night before going to sleep; she loved ""any and all"" fried foods, carbohydrates and sweets. Now she eats six small meals a day, using a child's plate to control her portion sizes. Her typical day consists of: . -- A protein shake with oatmeal for breakfast . -- Mixed nuts for a morning snack . -- A turkey salad sandwich for lunch . -- Yogurt with fruit for an afternoon snack . -- Chicken with vegetables and ""good carbs"" for dinner . -- And another protein shake for a post-dinner snack . All the people Williams has seen lose a significant amount of weight have one thing in common, he says: ""They're tired of being sick and tired."" Since that fateful day on the beach, Creamer has lost 145 pounds. She's happier and more positive than she's ever been, and it shows in every aspect of her life. She loves having enough energy to play with her kids. And she's introduced a ton of new customers to Williams' program. She's determined to spread her ""healthy hugs"" to other overweight women who are suffering. ""I feel like this is what I truly was put here to do, and honestly it (took) hitting rock bottom before I could understand that,"" Creamer says.

"Cady Stanton used to find solace in the sweet taste of ice cream. Growing up, she would sneak downstairs after her family had gone to sleep and numb her anxiety by digging into a half-gallon container. She would eat until she was sick, knowing this was something she had to do in secret. As the oldest child of a struggling Jehovah's Witness family, Stanton shouldered a lot of responsibilities at a young age. Her mother suffered from a number of health issues, and her father worked three jobs just to put food on the table. The family's financial struggles had a huge impact on Stanton's diet. Nearly all Stanton's family was overweight, as they had neither the resources nor the knowledge to prepare healthy meals regularly. They ate a lot of ground beef, spaghetti and the occasional treat of a take-and-bake pizza. They would wait in line for government-issued cheese and foodstuffs like powdered eggs and milk. ""Healthy eating requires money and time, something financially stressed families have little of,"" she said. ""We ate what was quick and cheap and familiar."" Stanton knew she was overweight in the first grade when she looked down and saw her feet swelling out of her Mary Janes. But it wasn't until her freshman year of high school that she made the connection between what she was eating and her body size. One day she found herself staring into the vending machine of the gym locker room. She was 5-feet-5-inches and 200 pounds. ""At that moment it finally struck me that what I ate made me overweight,"" she said. ""You'd think I would know that. I was an honors student."" Stanton changed her diet and started exercising regularly. In two years she went from 200 to 150 pounds. But there was one change she was still unable to make: sneaking food at night to comfort herself. Consuming large quantities of ice cream had a calming effect. She had no other way to cope with her anxiety, so she was unable to keep the weight off. She married in 1996 and moved to Washington. She stopped running and her weight climbed. She grew depressed when she realized the church she had joined wasn't as welcoming as the one in her hometown of Portland, which was her only social outlet as a child. She stopped weighing herself when she hit 265 pounds. In 2005, she divorced her husband and moved to Seattle to start rebuilding her life. She gave her car to a relative and started walking and biking everywhere, losing 50 pounds almost without effort. That same year, she met Ryan Laundry. She was pursuing her degree in psychology at the University of Washington at the time and weighed 215 pounds. While Laundry was interested in pursuing a romantic relationship, Stanton wouldn't allow herself to think that he could be in love with her. ""That's part of being overweight,"" she said. ""The last thing you want to do is humiliate yourself by assuming someone likes you romantically."" She moved to Pennsylvania to get a doctorate degree in Human Development and Family Studies, but she and Laundry reconnected when she returned to Seattle. They bonded over raising teenage boys: Stanton had adopted her son, David, in 2010, and Laundry was taking care of his teenage brother. It was as though they had never been apart. This time Stanton was open to letting herself be loved by Laundry. ""You can't live on someone else's love; you have to be OK on your own,"" she said. ""But I needed that to start taking care of myself, to start filling up those holes on my own."" Laundry told Stanton about how he had lost a lot of weight on a low-sugar diet and encouraged her to try it for herself. ""I balked. Bread had sugar. Pasta had sugar. Fruit had sugar. And, more importantly, my ice cream had sugar."" upwave: Take the cut back on sugar challenge! But at 215 pounds, she figured it was about time she let go of her reliance on food to ease her anxiety. She eliminated pastries, fast food, ice cream and even fruit with high amounts of sugar from her diet. Instead, she started eating salmon, tofu and grapefruit, learning the difference between emotional hunger and physical hunger. ""About four to five days in, my sugar cravings dropped. After two weeks, I didn't even care if there were cookies at work."" In a little more than a year, by the time she and Laundry were married in June 2012, Stanton had gone from 215 pounds to 157 pounds. Today she weighs 142 pounds. Stanton maintains this weight by enjoying limited amounts of foods she now considers ""treats."" For breakfast, she has a protein shake made with cranberry juice and probiotics. She also stays active by walking two miles as part of her regular commute, and running or going to the gym on weekends. Instead of sneaking ice cream at night, she now sets aside time for meditation in order to cope with stress. She doesn't keep any of her old escapes in the house, not even low-sugar ice cream. ""When I was overweight, I think people judged me somehow as less competent and efficient,"" she said. ""Life is easier. The guilt and shame I felt sneaking ice cream at night is gone.""","At night, Cady Stanton would eat ice cream in secret to cope with her anxiety .

"(CNN) -- A British supermarket chain has defended the sale of a wearable England flag that has been compared to a Ku Klux Klan uniform. The white and red flag of St. George in stock at ASDA outlets features a pointed hood which the store says will allow English fans to show support their national team during the World Cup while keeping dry during the notoriously unpredictable British summertime. But some fans have taken to social media sites to register their disapproval of the similarities between the ÃÂ£3 ($5) flags and the hooded outfits worn by the KKK. Twitter user @beyondlimits posted ""Dear ASDA, Your wearable klu klux klan style England flag is not acceptable."" Meanwhile, @iAmNaemaan said ""I don't think ASDA thought the whole 'wearable flag' thing through properly."" Pictures of the offending item have since been tweeted and retweeted hundreds of times on the micro-blogging site. A subsidiary of the American retail giant Walmart, ADSA issued a statement to CNN Friday addressing their surprise at the controversy and stressing that their hooded flag product is also available in other country's national colors. ""We know there's chatter on twitter about our wearable World Cup flags, but it's simply a flag with a hood -- nothing more, nothing less,"" the statement read. ""We opted for a hood on our wearable England and Brazilian flags as you never know what the British weather will bring. ""We want customers to get behind the team without getting wet."" The flag is just one of numerous World Cup themed items ASDA has been stocking in the run up to the tournament which kicks-off in Brazil on June 12. Other British supermarkets such as Tesco and Sainsbury's offer similar World Cup items which extend into products like beers, food, barbecues and televisions. Last year the British Retail Consortium estimated that the British economy could lose ÃÂ£2 billion ($3.5 billion) if England failed to qualify for the World Cup. Businesses are hence keen to cash in on the event while it lasts. However, it wasn't just Twitter users suggesting ASDA might have struck the wrong note with the wearable England flag. ""In theory it was a good idea because it's England and it rains,"" Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at Coventry University, told CNN. ""However, I think it does show a lack of good judgment and discretion on the part of people working for ASDA."" ""This is particularly the case in this country as there's a debate right now about the St George's Cross, about the flag, about immigration and the rise of UKIP,"" referring to the success of the Euro-skeptic political party in recent local and European Union elections. ""I think this showed a lack of good judgment on the part of the management,"" he said.","British supermarket ASDA unveils hooded flag for World Cup fans .

"(CNN) -- The presents had been opened; the wrapping paper was stuffed in the trash bin. Watching his 2-year-old daughter Cadence playing with her brand new Christmas toys, Kerry Hoffman was suddenly struck by a thought: . ""I need to be here to walk her down the aisle."" Startled by the idea, he turned and caught his reflection in the window, noticing his substantial arms, belly and neck. It was a sight he had grown accustomed to as the years passed, but on this particular day, a new resolve animated him. ""I can control this,"" he thought. ""And I've never really tried before."" At that moment, he made a promise to himself that he would lose the extra pounds -- he didn't know how just yet, but he would do it all the same. At 6 feet 1 inch tall, he weighed 343 pounds. It wasn't always this way. ""I graduated (high school) at 250 pounds, but not necessarily fat. I was from a very small town, and football was king. I started lifting weights at about 13,"" Hoffman said. The problem was, ""I never did any cardio. I could care less about running. ... I ate whatever I wanted."" That was the status quo until after he graduated college and got married. Then tragedy struck. ""I lost my father to liver disease when he was 55,"" Hoffman said. ""I think I was subconsciously using food as a coping mechanism because I loved to cook, and I loved to eat, and I still do. ... Hindsight is 20-20."" The day after his ""aha"" moment -- December 28, 2011 -- Hoffman joined a new gym near his house. He also scheduled an appointment with the doctor for New Year's Day 2012. The doctor performed a routine checkup, noting that Hoffman was already on medication for both high blood pressure and high cholesterol. But Hoffman wanted one more question answered. Near the end of the physical, he requested that the doctor test his blood sugar. It was 277, almost 200% above normal. It was official: He had diabetes. ""I told the doctor, and this is a direct quote, 'I'm going to lose over 100 pounds, and I'm going to cure myself of diabetes.'"" The doctor was skeptical, telling him that many people decide to lose weight on New Year's, and that very few succeed. Hoffman decided to try anyway. The first day of his new exercise regimen began with a shrill alarm at 5:30 a.m. He had made a commitment not to take time away from his family, so early morning workouts were the logical choice. When he arrived at the gym, it was completely empty. Immediately, he was struck by the astounding variety of exercise equipment that was available, and his complete lack of experience with any of it. ""I didn't know what speed to try, what incline. I just tried the treadmill because it seemed simplest. I was terribly out of shape, didn't know what a good calorie burn was, how long to go -- I didn't know anything. I was a newbie."" Even so, he kept it up, five days a week. His wife, Emily Hoffman, was surprised at his commitment. ""He was so determined,"" she said, ""and any small positive change in his body kept him moving forward."" The most difficult obstacle for Hoffman was changing his diet. ""Once you're addicted to food, you're always addicted to food,"" he said. ""If somebody put a fresh plate of brownies in front of me, it would be just as hard to say no as it was at the beginning. (But) you can never outwork a poor diet."" Hoffman began keeping track of his caloric intake with a smart phone app, limiting himself to 2,000 calories a day. He also tried to find healthy versions of his favorite foods: cheese made with skim milk, pizza made with wheat dough and even black bean brownies. Over the course of the year, Hoffman made swift progress. As the holiday season rolled around again, he made another trip to the doctor. When the results came in for his blood pressure and sugar level tests, both he and he doctor were stunned. ""The doctor called all the nurses and doctors and pediatricians out of their rooms and said 'This guy actually did it,'"" Hoffman remembered proudly. ""Everyone clapped."" But that was not the end. Today, Hoffman weighs 190 pounds. In order to maintain his healthy lifestyle, he continues to wear a calorie tracker every day. He also keeps two pictures beside his bed, one from before his weight loss and one after, reminding himself every morning and every night, ""Never again."" Hoffman also continues to look for new ways to improve his personal fitness, describing himself as ""a fitness dork."" Earlier this year, he participated in his first triathlon. After training ""like crazy,"" he snagged first place. From 343 pounds to a lean 190. From not knowing how to use a treadmill to winning a triathlon. From ""newbie"" to ""fitness dork."" In a short time, Hoffman made a drastic change. After that, he just kept going.","Kerry Hoffman was a fit football player until he lost his father to liver disease .

"Critics of President Barack Obama's foreign policy are getting louder by the day, and that poses risks for Democrats this fall and even in 2016. According to previews of Hillary Clinton's memoirs, ""Hard Choices,"" the former secretary of state distances herself from Obama on certain decisions, such as on the question of whether to arm Syrian rebels. She wanted to be more aggressive; he did not. Democrats have grown more nervous about foreign policy as Obama has been working hard to respond to critics who say hasn't taken a tough-enough line.  The controversy over the deal to secure the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for five Taliban prisoners has flared into an extraordinarily heated debate. Obama has watched as his approval rating for handling international affairs has fallen to 41%. Last month, Obama had to stand by as Republicans launched another round of congressional investigations into the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya. Russia's aggressive moves into the Ukraine stirred talk of a new Cold War and concern that the President didn't really have a viable response to this kind of aggression. Opinion: Why we leave no man behind . More recently, the controversies shifted to the President's broader vision or lack thereof. Republicans found a lot to dislike in his address at West Point, where Obama indicated that the nation should step back from using military power as freely as it has done in the past. Soon after came the news about the release of Bergdahl, in exchange for the release of five notorious Taliban prisoners. Republicans were quick to accuse the President of negotiating with terrorists. They have also accused him of violating the law by failing to inform Congress of the impending deal. Even though Democrats point to a number of huge accomplishments during the Obama presidency -- the killing of Osama bin Laden, the drawdown of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and diplomatic initiatives to bring nuclear disarmament in Iran without bloodshed -- the critics have upped their volume. All of the recent stories add up to the potential for foreign policy to emerge as a potent issue in the midterm campaigns this fall. Congressional Democrats could suffer as a result of the unhappiness with the administration's policies. Even though midterm elections generally focus on bread and butter questions about the health of the economy, as well as local concerns, there are times when foreign policy can hurt the party of the president. In 1966, for instance, Republicans campaigned against Lyndon Johnson's policies in Vietnam. GOP officials such as former Vice President Richard Nixon said that Johnson was not unleashing enough force against the North Vietnamese Communists and leaving U.S. troops in a quagmire. In 1978, Republicans railed against President Jimmy Carter for his alleged weakness in foreign policy, claiming that he gave away too much in the Panama Canal Treaties and that he was pursuing a dangerous policy of dÃ©tente with the Soviet Union. In 1982, Democrats, who were generally focused on the recession, also spoke in favor of a nuclear freeze and warned that President Ronald Reagan's embrace of the military was bringing the nation close to war. More recently, Republicans blasted Democrats in 2002 for being weak on defense after having not supported the administration's homeland security bill. And in 2006, Democratic candidates returned the favor by criticizing the president's war in Iraq as a reckless, unnecessary and  extremely costly operation that had actually undermined the war on terrorism. Gingrich: Bergdahl, Boko Haram and Benghazi . While foreign policy carried different levels of weight in these midterms, in some of these contests, such as 1966 and 2006, the administration's actions overseas dismayed voters. Will foreign policy play a factor in the 2014 midterms? It is unlikely that it will be a major issue but there are ways it could have an indirect effect on the ballot box and cause trouble for Democrats when Americans turn out to vote. At the most immediate level, the foreign policy controversy has already distracted the news media from other kinds of stories upon which congressional Democrats were hoping to focus. The foreign policy controversy intensified just as there was evidence that the economy was picking up steam and that the Obama's health care program was gaining strength. Both signs of accomplishment were put on the back burner, overshadowed by the Bergdahl debate. The stories also feed the perception of some voters who feel that Democrats have not done a good job managing government. This is a White House that once prided itself on competence. Obama, a well-educated politician who surrounded himself with bright staff, vowed to avoid the kind of mismanagement that had been on display with Hurricane Katrina during President George W. Bush's term. But that reputation has slowly been undercut, especially after the botched health care website rollout and the VA scandal. Opinion: Bergdahl deal was an ugly decision but right . Some of the coverage of the foreign policy, including recent reports on how the deal with the Taliban was handled, have played into these kinds of criticism. The New York Times published a lengthy piece about the diminishing returns that Obama was able to obtain over the past several years in exchange for the release of the Taliban 5 and evidence of how his team had mishandled the process. The Berghdal deal is also becoming a way to question the veracity of Democratic promises. Members of Congress, in both parties, have alleged that Obama violated the law by ignoring a federal statute that says the president must inform Congress one month before such a deal is completed. They have said he is acting exactly like Bush, whom he had accused of discounting legislative intent through sweeping notions of executive power. The foreign policy debate puts into focus the argument that Obama, as well as the party he leads, lacks a bold vision. This is something that has even frustrated many Democrats who feel that the President is too much of pragmatist and not enough of a visionary. The speech at West Point fell flat for some Americans because it almost seemed focus on excusing what he couldn't do rather outlining what he wants to do. During his visit to the Philippines, the President explained his outlook on foreign policy by saying, ""You hit singles, you hit doubles; every once in a while you may be able to hit a home run."" The debate over foreign policy helps Republicans by riling up the party's base at an opportune time, five months before the election, while at the same time dispiriting the Democrats. Yes, voters are thinking primarily about how they're faring in today's economy, but on the margins, their perception of their local candidate's views on foreign policy could be a factor in November.

"(CNN) -- By the time he hit 327 pounds, Robert Foster had been playing ""the fat guy"" for decades. His size was the thing that made him stand out. Publicly, he embraced his lifestyle as a ""BBQ-lovin', beef-eatin', no-veggie-buyin'"" male who wore T-shirts flaunting his hefty size. There was a particularly perverse one, he says looking back on it, which read ""I beat anorexia."" Privately, he was resentful that he wasn't thinner. He felt angry when he couldn't bear to take his four little girls to the park because he was too exhausted from unloading groceries. He resented being told he was too big for the seat-belt latch on amusement park rides. His wife, Jessica, was also obese, at 287 pounds. Unlike Rob, she felt invisible. Customers at the bank where she worked stared past her as they made their transactions. In late 2011, a close family member made a comment at the dinner table that stuck with her: . ""She used to be something to look at. Not anymore."" In late March 2012, the Colorado couple had an emotional conversation. Jess was coming up on her 30th birthday and was sick of the way she looked and felt. They had had talks like this before, where they talked about needing to change, but something was different that night. ""I adore my kids and I love my husband very much, but there was that point I hated myself so much. I wasn't giving them the full me because I was disgusted,"" Jess said. ""You have to look in the mirror and say, 'Am I going to allow this to continue or am I going to stand up and make those changes?' A light turned on upstairs."" The next week, she began taking Zumba classes. In just a few weeks, she had lost 14 pounds -- enough to motivate her to take on new physical challenges. She moved on to bikes and treadmills and made sure to sweat for an hour at least three times a week. After that, there was no turning back, she said. Rob was a little slower to change -- the thought of going for a run was ""unappealing to the point of agony"" -- but he started playing tennis and stopped taking seconds at dinner. In the summer of 2012, they added other physical activities that didn't feel like working out, like hiking and recreational swimming with their kids and friends. They got hooked on the physical highs and wanted to do more. Rob joined Jess in training for a 5-kilometer race that December. He walked as much as he ran, and Jess finished way ahead of him. But something in him changed. ""The race environment and the high fives and the feeling of accomplishment became addicting to me,"" he said. ""After that day, I swore I would work to run a 5k without slowing to a walk."" In Rob's words, ""it got crazy from there."" The more he ran, the more he felt he needed to run. When he put on his sneakers and took off, ""I felt like my whole life was skyrocketing upward,"" he said. A few months after that first 5k, he ran his second, this time without walking. Then he did his first 10-mile run. And in May 2014, he ran his first marathon. By then he was 160 pounds lighter. Throughout the process, the couple used a calorie-counting app to keep track of everything they ate. They knew they wanted to break their family's cycle of unhealthy relationships with food while their children were still young. ""It got to the point where we realized it didn't matter what we fed them,"" Rob said. ""If we weren't eating the same way or if we were overeating, they were going to follow our example."" The Fosters began shopping only the periphery of grocery stores, never entering the aisles unless it was for cereal. They added more fruits, vegetables and lean white meats and fish. They also began cooking everything they ate from scratch, including breads, dressings and sauces. ""Our whole philosophy towards food was adding good things,"" Rob said. ""What we found was, the more and more good things we added, the less we craved the garbage."" After months of a diet rich in whole grains, green vegetables and lean meats, they recently made the decision to go vegan for health, environmental and ethical reasons. Rob and Jess now each weigh 167 pounds, down a collective 280 pounds. Jessica has lost 120 pounds from the start of their journey; Rob has lost 160. They feel healthier, happier and ready to tackle the world. Rob, a former bank branch manager, has gone back to college to pursue a bachelor's degree in integrative physiology with the goal of entering medical school. This May, he completed his first year of college. He's not ""the fat guy"" anymore, and he's fine with that. Jess feels pretty great, too. Now a size 10, down from size 24, she's still getting used to people paying attention to her. She re-entered the workforce in July 2013 after five years as a stay-at-home mom and was surprised at the difference in how people treated her. ""A lot of people became very friendly and were really looking at me in my face, instead of this blank stare. ... And obviously, the opposite sex was more playful, always complimentary. I never had that. Never, ever, ever,"" she said. ""I love myself. I like what I'm seeing in the mirror. I know there's some work to still be done, but I'm such a different person than I was before.""","Robert and Jessica Foster had been obese for years .

"Hundreds of people were killed in raids by Boko Haram Islamic militants in northeast Nigeria's Borno state, on the border with Cameroon, with some sources putting the death toll at 400 to 500. On Tuesday, heavily armed men dressed as soldiers in all-terrain vehicles and on motorcycles attacked neighboring Goshe, Attagara, Agapalwa and Aganjara villages in Gwoza district, shooting residents to death and burning homes. The attacks forced surviving villagers to flee to Cameroon and into the Mandara Mountains on the border. ""The killings are massive. Nobody can say how many people were killed, but the figure runs into some hundreds,"" said Peter Biye, a lawmaker in Nigeria's lower parliament representing the Gwoza region. ""The area is still under the control of the insurgents, and residents can't go back to bury the dead because of the danger involved,"" he said. On Wednesday, a military jet bombarded Boko Haram positions to dislodge the militants from the villages they have occupied, forcing them to temporarily withdraw. ""They returned immediately after the jet left, making it too risky for villagers to return to bury the dead,"" Biye said. Dead bodies litter the area around the attacked villages. Ground troops have yet to go to the area to push out the insurgents, he said. The attackers, who posed as soldiers, told residents they had come to protect them from Boko Haram and asked them to assemble. They singled out men and boys and opened fire on them, Biye said. A local leader in Attagara village, who fled to nearby Madagali town in neighboring Adamawa state, said the death toll was staggering. ""The death is unimaginable. We have lost between 400 and 500 people in the attacks in which men and male children were not spared,"" said the local leader, who asked not to be named for security reasons. ""The gunmen pursued on motorcycle people who fled into the bush in a bid to escape and shot them dead. ""Even nursing mothers had their male infants snatched from their backs and shot dead before their eyes,"" the local leader said. The insurgents destroyed mobile phone towers in the region, so news of attacks is usually slow to emerge and verification of death tolls difficult to obtain. If the death toll is confirmed, it will be the worst attack by Boko Haram in its five-year insurgency that has killed thousands, mostly in the northeast. Boko Haram: A bloody insurgency, a growing challenge . On May 5, the group killed 315 people in the town of Gamboru Ngala on the border with Cameroon not far from Gwoza, where they burned a market, businesses and several homes. Meanwhile, dozens of Boko Haram fighters stormed Madagali town early Thursday, burning a church and a local government administrative building after subduing military and police personnel, a local official said. Residents said two civilians were killed in crossfire during a shootout between soldiers and the gunmen. ""They came around 6 a.m. ... in 10 all-terrain vehicles and on several motorcycles, all dressed in military uniforms,"" said Maina Ularamu, a Madagali local government chairman. The gunmen overran a police checkpoint, forcing policemen to flee, and then opened fire on a military checkpoint just outside the town, where they engaged soldiers in a shootout. After overwhelming the soldiers who withdrew from the checkpoint, the gunmen attacked and burned a Roman Catholic church and a local government office opposite it, Ularamu said. 4 Nigerian villages reeling after Boko Haram attack: 'We lost many people' Nigeria backtracks on ban on protests for kidnapped girls in capital .

"Boko Haram Islamists abducted 60 females, including children, and killed 30 men last week in a raid of a village in northeastern Nigeria, two sources said Tuesday. Dressed as soldiers, the gunmen invaded the village of Kummabza in Borno state on June 18 and held the people hostage for four days, the sources said. After killing the 30 male villagers and looting food supplies, they whisked away 60 female hostages and set the village on fire with petrol bombs and explosives, a senior local government official said. Some of the kidnapped girls were between the ages of 3 and 12. News of the raid was slow to emerge after insurgents bombed telecom masts, limiting communication. But details filtered out when residents left the village Monday after the insurgents withdrew. ""They took away 60 women, including small girls, after holding the village hostage for four days and killing 30 men,"" said the local official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals from Boko Haram. ""They set the whole village on fire while they were leaving after carting away all the foodstuff from the barns,"" the official said. Abba Aji Khalili, a vigilante leader in Maiduguri, said, ""The survivors had to trek to nearby Lassa village 25 kilometers away and Madagali town in neighboring Adamawa state before people got to know what had happened."" Some villagers too weak to make the long trek were still in the village in ""dire need of humanitarian assistance,"" Khalil said. ""They are facing a serious humanitarian challenge"" because they have no access to food, water and shelter, he said. Northeastern Nigeria is the home of Boko Haram, the militant Islamists who abducted scores of schoolgirls in April. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.","Village raid occurred in Nigeria's Borno state, where Boko Haram has a presence .

"(CNN) -- There are workout horror stories and then there's Kathleen Riser, who was mocked by the most unlikely of sources: a fitness trainer at the gym. ""There's another one who will break our equipment,"" she overheard one trainer say 2ÃÂ½ years ago, pointing at her 350-plus pound frame. It was only a confirmation of her fears. Riser had spent years avoiding fitness establishments out of embarrassment. ""I hadn't been to a gym since I was in college, and every time I try to get enrolled I would feel uncomfortable,"" she said. ""I would feel like people were watching."" People now point to Riser as an inspiration. The 54-year-old has lost 200 pounds. ""When I first started this journey two and a half years ago, I was desperate. ... I actually thought this was the end of my life,"" she wrote in her CNN iReport. ""I was determined not to die like this."" A downward spiral . Riser has dedicated her professional career to others. As a middle school teacher, she helped children enter her classroom and leave as knowledgeable, well-rounded teenagers. After school, Riser spent long hours as a band director, including nights and weekends traveling to competitions. Unfortunately, the teacher, who is now retired, was unable to apply the same dedication toward her personal life. ""Every morning it was a McDonald's sausage biscuit or fast-food breakfast,"" she said. ""I ate a lot of French fries, and a bunch of white bread. ""Really I was just a constant eater."" At 5 feet 4 inches tall, Riser realized her weight was destroying her knees. She needed four surgeries, and each seemed to take a bigger toll on her body than the last. She knew she was robbing herself of a productive life. ""It was hard for me to stand up without rocking or without leaning or something,"" she said. ""I couldn't fly without getting a (seat-belt) extension for myself. And all those little things, like not being able to go on amusement park rides, were starting to get to me."" The breaking point: Riser struggled to climb the stairs to get to her school classroom. She estimates her peak weight was 383 pounds. ""I was on a one-way street to dying."" Riser decided to find a judgment-free gym, change her eating habits and give healthy living another shot. Thanks to a tough-loving accountability group, her personal trainer Shaun Lloyd and her own dedication, Riser has achieved what she calls her goal: proving that middle-aged women can lose weight. ""People say that when you get older, it's harder to lose weight,"" she said. ""Or that I was always going to be large. It became one of my inspirations to prove people wrong."" Lloyd credit's Riser's success to one simple fact: ""She just doesn't take no for an answer."" The transformation . Lloyd knew he would have to gain Riser's trust after she was scarred by the hurtful comments about her weight. But that was not especially difficult: Riser just needed someone to listen. ""She was a stress eater,"" Lloyd said. ""Things that were heavy on her heart translated to things that were heavy on the plate. I wanted to give her different avenues that could help her heart process."" And so began the mental transformation, unlocking Riser's determination and belief that she could lose weight. Riser began to plan her meals with Lloyd: a supplement shake for breakfast, lean protein and veggies for lunch and the same for dinner. Snacks of junk food were replaced with raw almonds or hummus. And Riser completely eliminated processed foods, white flours, sodas and sweets from her diet. Instantly, she began to see results. ""The treadmill was going at one of the slowest speeds, and I lost three pounds,"" she said. ""I knew if I could get myself moving, it was possible."" Two years later, Riser is still moving, and the weight has continued to fall off. She's exchanged her 42W clothing for size 18. Riser now weighs under 180 pounds and expects to hit her target weight by the end of the year. She works out six days a week and plans healthy meals for herself and her parents -- sometimes cooking a week's worth of meals in one day. ""I believe in myself again,"" she said. ""Yes, there are of course days I get discouraged, but that is why it is so important to have someone around to help hold you accountable and love you."" Riser's parents are both fighting serious diseases. She said she believes her transformation has been critical in allowing her to be a good caregiver. ""My father has cancer, and my mother has dementia,"" she said. ""And now I have the energy and strength to help my father get up and down. That's definitely been important."" Riser credits her family, friends and personal trainers for helping spur her lifestyle changes. ""They saved my life,"" she said.","Kathleen Riser has gone from eating fast food daily to working out six days a week .

"Lifelong Democrat Jackie Bland is doing something she never thought she'd do: Urge people to vote for a Republican. Bland supports Thad Cochran, a six-term Mississippi senator who's trying to fend off a fierce tea party challenge to his seat from Chris McDaniel as voting got underway in Tuesday's primary runoff. Two weeks ago, Bland helped put up 5,000 pro-Cochran posters in black communities and talk to people about his record. ""We wanted to raise the awareness to African-Americans that we do have a stake in this runoff election,"" she said. She pointed to Cochran's efforts to secure federal funds for jobs, Head Start programs and health centers relied upon by African-Americans in the state. ""We don't want to move backwards,"" she said. Bland's efforts reflect the high stakes locally and nationally in the Cochran-McDaniel showdown and also illustrate the unscripted political realities of particular states that play out on Election Day. In this case, it's apparent that Cochran needs Democrats to keep his job, and some Democrats heed the fact that Democratic Senate nominee Travis Childers likely won't win in November, so they turn out for a Republican. In Mississippi, neither candidate secured 50% of the vote in the GOP primary this month, requiring a runoff election. And both sides over the past few weeks have relentlessly pursued get-out-the-vote efforts. Unheralded candidate believes he played spoiler in Cochran race . Mississippi law allows anyone to vote in the runoff, meaning Democrats can go to the polls so long as they didn't vote in the Democratic primary and they don't plan to support their party candidate in the general election. The question is whether Cochran can shore up enough support to beat back the tea party wave against him. McDaniel got about 1,400 more votes than Cochran in the primary, and national conservative groups have actively rallied around the challenger. Mississippi primary spending spree pushes advertisers off the air . Cochran is pushing his message that his experience makes him more influential in Congress, and his ties on Capitol Hill will better serve Mississippi if he's reelected. McDaniel and allies, however, say Cochran has been in office long enough, and his tenure only breathes more life to the status quo. For his part, McDaniel vows to bring change to the nation's capital and shake things up on Capitol Hill. ""The people of this country are finally waking up again and recognizing that Washington's been broken for a long time,"" McDaniel said Monday, referring to tea party victories in recent years. ""All the sudden you see a great awakening among all the people, particularly those who are very dissatisfied with the direction our country is going."" Courting the African-American vote . Mississippi Conservatives, a super PAC founded by former Gov. Haley Barbour and his nephew, Henry, has taken the lead in courting votes from Democrats, especially in the African-American community. Cochran's allies are arguing the case that he has long been there for the voting bloc and would better represent their interests than McDaniel. The issue is so complicated that even Bland can hardly stomach what she's doing. She attended an event Monday featuring Republican Sen. John McCain, who called on voters to keep Cochran in Washington but also spent much of his speech blasting President Barack Obama. Bland, a supporter of the President, got up and left. Cochran acknowledged Monday he would likely benefit if a wide range of voters turn out for the runoff. ""I've always reached out and benefited from support from the black community,"" he said. ""My responsibility as a United States senator has been to represent the people of the state of Mississippi, not just one party or one race or a select group of friends."" But another Mississippi political veteran labeled the vote courting a risky move. ""It might get him some votes, but it might lose him some votes,"" said former Republican Sen. Trent Lott. The ex-Senate majority leader not only served with Cochran for many years, but the two were competitors for the leadership position in 1996. Lott now describes Cochran as ""a good friend"" and said he's ""very nervous"" about the runoff.  It will be ""difficult for Thad to overcome the momentum"" by McDaniel, he predicted. Vote underway . Conservative groups are working with Christian Adams, a former Justice Department official, to train volunteers to monitor poll workers and make sure they check to see whether Democrats have already voted in their primary. Some critics question whether the effort might lead to voter intimidation. The Mississippi NAACP dispatched about 250 volunteers to watch poll stations and look for any signs of interference. They're supposed to call the state office if anyone is turned away, but enforcing the crossover primary rule may be hard to enforce. Wayne McDaniels, president the NAACP's Jackson City Branch, said the biggest concern is polling stations in rural areas. ""There won't be much coverage as far as the news media out there, so those are the pockets where someone might figure they can get away with certain things,"" he said. McDaniels said the state office hadn't yet receive any calls or suspicious reports from any of the volunteers in the field. CNN saw three people turned away by poll workers in Jackson because they voted in the Democratic primary. Monitoring crossover voters . Adams is overseeing the ""election integrity project"" for the conservative groups FreedomWorks, Tea Party Patriots and Senate Conservatives Fund, said Monday in a phone interview that volunteers won't be instructed to talk to voters or poll workers, but only monitor the process at polling stations across the state. ""These are not negotiators,"" he told CNN, stressing that they're ""not activists urging people"" to vote one way or the other. He said the volunteers will ""observe what's going on and how to memorialize the events of the day in an observer report,"" which will be reviewed by lawyers. But he refused to elaborate on who the lawyers are and who they work for. He also declined to be more specific about where exactly the volunteers would be working, saying only that they will be stationed at polling locations ""across the state.""  Pressed on why he was providing few details about an effort that seeks transparency and honesty in an election process, Adams didn't give an answer. McDaniel, who chairs the elections committee in the state Senate, said Monday he approves of the monitoring effort and doubts intimidation will become an issue. ""The issue is to make sure we have a fair process,"" he said. He argued that a high Democratic turnout for Cochran would reveal the senator's true colors. ""I'm not concerned about them being African-American. I'm concerned about them being liberal,"" he told CNN. ""That's always been my concern. If Senator Cochran is going to court liberal Democrats to save his seat, that's a good indication that he's abandoned conservatism in Mississippi."" Learning from last time . Since Cochran failed to defeat McDaniel in the primary, the senator and his campaign have been more aggressive about their ground game. Sources familiar with Cochran's campaign strategy say they hope that a lot of Republicans who stayed home during the primary, thinking Cochran would be fine, will show up at the polls. The senator has had a more active schedule for the runoff and his overall operation is more finely tuned. On Monday, he campaigned with McCain, who reiterated the pitch that an experienced senator is more beneficial for a state. McDaniel doubled down on his attack line against Cochran, saying his partnership with McCain further proves how out of touch the senator is with conservatives. Former Sen. Lott has also helped out Cochran by cutting an ad for his former colleague. He said he didn't do much for Cochran in the  primary because ""I think they didn't think they needed me."" But the runoff's been different. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also pitched in for Cochran and produced an ad featuring retired NFL star Brett Favre, a Mississippi native. But Cochran isn't the only one with a celebrity endorsement. Longtime game show host Chuck Woolery headlined a bus tour organized by the Tea Party Express. While Cochran has tried to make the case that his near-four decades in the Senate brings wisdom and power, he's fighting an uphill battle against a younger politician and former talk radio host who paints himself as the candidate more principled and eager to help lead a conservative movement in the Senate. Jeremiah Boddy, 20, a student at the University of Southern Mississippi and a McDaniel supporter, showed up to a Cochran event Monday. ""I feel like it's the same rhetoric, just washed and put in different clothes,"" he told CNN. ""I mean he has no charisma, and as far as I'm concerned, he couldn't sell you a brand new car, even if it was free.""","GOP Sen.

"Taking your baby along to a new play group can be nerve-wracking. You don't want any fuss, you just want to blend in. You hope and pray that your kid isn't the one who screams, hits or breaks something. All you want is to slip in, sit down and be told how beautiful and well-behaved your little one is. Prince George was put to the test Wednesday at a specially convened play group in Government House, Wellington, New Zealand. The 8-month-old was never going to just slip in, because he had brought the world's media with him. But he didn't scream, hit or break anything ... just one incident of theft. Amelia Howe was playing with a plastic block. George grabbed it, Amelia screamed, and Mr. and Mrs. Howe apologized to the Duchess of Cambridge. They later explained that Amelia had hurt herself by biting down too hard on the toy. ""This one was chewing on a toy, and she's teething, so she bit it, and it obviously hurt her. She dropped it, and the toy got flogged, and that was the end of it,"" her father said. There were no hard feelings, and the Howes are hoping Amelia will stay in touch with her new British playmate. A royal wedding in 30 years' time? The event was organized by the parental support group, Plunket, and a diverse group of families was invited, including a single mom and gay couple. All the 10 babies attending were born within a few weeks of Prince George. He was the biggest: ""quite a bruiser,"" said one onlooker. Parent Jared Mullen said the Duke and Duchess were ""lovely first-time parents."" ""In many ways, they're in the same boat as all of us who are trying to get used to it, and it was just very nice to have a relaxed time,"" he said, describing young George as ""very intrepid."" The playgroup was Prince George's main event in New Zealand. We don't expect to see him at another engagement until the tour moves on to Australia. This event was typically informal for William and Kate, who swapped parental anecdotes (George is finally sleeping through the night, apparently). It may have felt like a regular play group, but of course, it wasn't. Who knows what most of them will do when they grow up. The world is their oyster. One of them, though, has had his whole life mapped out for him. George is destined to be their king. He hasn't got a clue about that yet, of course. In fact, it's the only time in his life that he will feel normal. For George, it was just a play date. Prince George's first royal tour: The kid's a natural .

"Sarah Luchsinger started playing Disney's online game ""Toontown"" in 2005 at the urging of her then 10-year-old goddaughter. It's become a place where she can spend time with her husband and two sons, working together on tasks and feeling like part of the larger ""Toontown"" community. Now Disney is shutting the virtual world down and many long-time players like Luchsinger are dealing with the loss of an online home. Launched in 2003, Disney's ""Toontown Online"" is a game for children and families where players work together to battle evil robots called Cogs, or pass the time growing gardens, fishing, and racing cars on the Goofy Speedway. In Toontown, members can also just hang out and chat with the friends they've made in the virtual world. After 10 years and a significant drop in user numbers, Disney has decided to instead focus its resources on the more popular ""Club Penguin"" virtual world, which has about 200 million registered users. ""Toontown"" will be shuttered September 19. The closing of an online virtual game may sound trivial to anyone who has never used or visited one, but to the people who spent a chunk of their formative years forging relationships inside their virtual walls, the loss can be huge. For players of massively multiplayer online games (called MMOs or MMOGs) an online game can feel like a richly populated parallel universe with a distinct culture and set of social groups. ""When a virtual world closes, its users lose many things all at once,"" said Nick Yee, a researcher who has been studying virtual worlds for 14 years. ""A living, breathing community with its own unique culture, slang, and lore; an accessible and familiar hangout with regulars and familiar faces; an online identity and persona that they're emotionally invested in and cultivated over time; and a social network of friends who have shared many experiences together."" MMOs can be a place to try on different identities. You get to choose how you are presented and make connections without worrying about looks or other snap judgments. ""This game is a home to us, a place where we can be who we are, where we can just be normal without discrimination and judgment,"" said longtime ""Toontown"" member Denise Tan. In a large online survey of players from games such as ""World of Warcraft,"" Yee found 24% of players had confided personal issues or secrets to online friends that they had not told their real life friends. The online communities can feel just as real as their in-person worlds -- 41% said the friends they'd made online were comparable or better friends than the ones they had in real life. Other massively multiplayer online games have shut down after multiyear runs. After eight years, the ""Star Wars Galaxies"" game was given the Alderaan treatment and destroyed in 2011. Many of those players migrated to ""Star Wars: The Old Republic."" After ""URU: Ages Beyond Myst"" closed for the first time in 2004, 10,000 players were virtual ""refugees"" who moved on to other virtual worlds like ""Second Life,"" according to Celia Pearce who studied the displaced URU players as part of her Ph.D. thesis. Disney is hoping the diaspora of ""Toontown"" players will find a new home in ""Club Penguin. ""Toontown"" is far from being the most well-known or popular MMO to shut down, but that hasn't stopped a vocal outpouring of protests from the dedicated fan base. There is a Change.org petition asking Disney to keep ""Toontown"" open and it has already gathered more than 9,000 signatures from members around the world. ""To some it was more than a mere game. It was a childhood. Adventures, exploration, meeting new friends and so much more ... it had a lot of meaning to all of us,"" reads the petition. Because ""Toontown"" was a family game open to anyone 7 and older, many of its more dedicated users started as children and grew into young adults while playing the game, making it an integral part of their childhood. ""I think 'Toontown' is unique in that its long-time users literally grew up with the game,"" said Yee. ""It's a little like me telling someone that they're tearing down 'Sesame Street.' Or that they're tearing down the neighborhood playground where you used to play."" Those tight relationships made in the game world frequently carried over into real life. There were even in-person gatherings for players called ToonFest at Walt Disney Studios and Walt Disney World. Adults also used it to communicate with their younger family members. After a divorce, Mike Kahn found himself 3,000 miles from his young son. The two have turned to ""Toontown"" as an entertaining alternative to Skype. ""Most people know 8-year-old boys don't want to talk on the phone much. 'Toontown' has become the solution for us to spend time together,"" said Kahn. ""We can log in, my son in Florida and my daughter and I in Idaho and all play together while talking, laughing and spending quality family time together."" Grandparents like Mary Hudnall used it to keep in touch with grandkids, though she recently cut down after the 12-year-old grandson she played with the most moved on to ""Minecraft.""","Disney is closing its online virtual game ""Toontown"" after 10 years .

"An investigation into appalling conditions in school hostels has won two South African journalists the top prize at the CNN MultiChoice African Journalist Awards. Msindisi Fengu and Yandisa Monakali shared the top honor of CNN MultiChoice African Journalist of the Year for their series ""School hostels of shame,"" which appeared in South African newspaper Daily Dispatch. The series investigated appalling conditions experienced by thousands of pupils in South Africa's Eastern Cape, uncovering hygiene and safety risks in school hostels and lifting the lid on corruption within the education department. Their winning entry was chosen from 1,387 submissions from 42 nations across the continent. It also won the Print General News Award. ""It's a huge honor to win,"" the pair said in a statement. ""It means all the work we put in has been rewarded.  It always feel good to be recognized by your fellow journalists.  We'll keep pushing this agenda."" Ferial Haffajee, chair of the judging panel, said the top prize was tightly contested. ""But we felt that 'Hostels of shame' had resonance across the continent.

"(CNN) -- Yusuke Kirimoto was always overweight. When he visited his relatives in Japan, they would jokingly say, ""the sumo wrestler is back."" Their comments were meant to be funny, but Kirimoto still felt the sting. Kirimoto and his wife Megumi had their daughter Sara in 2006. Like many toddlers, Sara would run around their Westminster, Colorado, home, and Kirimoto would trail behind her, trying to catch up. But as she got older, keeping up with Sara became a struggle for him, both physically and mentally. ""I would oftentimes be so out of breath that I would almost pass out,"" he said. At this point, his diet mainly consisted of burgers, fries and sub sandwiches, and at least six cans of soda a day. By 2010, the 37-year-old, standing at 5'10, hit his peak weight of 270 pounds. ""It was the lowest point of my life,"" he said. He had to start wearing XXXL shirts because the XXL was too small. Kirimoto became reclusive -- even to his family. Often he would shut himself in the basement where he could be alone to eat while sitting at the computer with the curtains drawn. But Sara, then 4 years old, would find her way down to the basement and beg him to play with her. Seeing the strain he was putting on himself and his family depressed Kirimoto, and by Christmas of 2010, something snapped. He didn't want to miss out on his daughter growing up. He didn't want to be tired and alone anymore. He didn't want to feel bad about himself. He wanted to change his life. But like so many, he had a horrible track record of failed diets and exercise attempts. He had tried countless diets in the past, and had joined a handful of gyms, that he paid for despite never going. ""I would try crazy fad diets like eating tofu for two weeks. I would cling on to anything to lose weight with the least amount of work,"" he said. But those fad diets would never last more than a few weeks, and his weight would rebound. Even his wife was skeptical of his newfound inspiration to lose weight. ""She would eat those types of (rich) foods in front of me jokingly, but that skepticism was the fuel. I wanted to prove people wrong,"" he said. He was determined to not make the same mistakes again. This time, he was going to focus on losing weight by restricting his diet first. Then he would slowly incorporate exercise. Part of that decision came from the fear of hurting himself after spending years without working out. Committing to healthier foods . Kirimoto drastically cut down on his sugar and carbohydrate intake six days a week, and used Saturday as his cheat day where he could eat whatever he wanted. His breakfast burrito was replaced with a light yogurt and a hard boiled egg or an apple. He started taking a salad to work, a dramatic shift from the fast food lunches he used to consume during his workday. Although his dinners at home had always been relatively healthy -- stir fry or cooked vegetables with white rice -- Kirimoto would typically eat too much, sometimes consuming two or three meals' worth of food in one sitting. ""I would eat a whole bowl of rice or big servings of stir fry. I would eat 'til I was full, then you sort of become numb to the fullness,"" he said. That changed as he started making a conscious effort to watch his portion sizes. He remembers the intense feeling of withdrawal. ""My body really was asking for richer and fattier foods,"" he said. It was a struggle to resist delicacies like pizza and pasta, or even pantry staples like rice and bread. But the cravings slowly subsided and he noticed that even on his cheat day he was eating smaller portions. At the start of 2011, Kirimoto began a fitness routine. He started lifting weights three days a week at the gym before work. It felt awkward at first, as he tried to get used to the rhythm of his body, but those feelings dissipated as he gained more energy and confidence. Midway through the year, he incorporated running into his workout routine. He was now running and lifting weights five days a week. It was a momentous step for Kirimoto,who says he used to treat running like a joke. ""Unless I was being chased by a bear or axe murderer, it was never something I did,"" he wrote in his iReport. By December 2011, he had dropped 81 pounds. But Kirimoto felt like his treadmill runs were getting him nowhere -- literally. ""I just felt like a hamster on a wheel, the only thing missing was the water bottle,"" he recalled. He told colleague Anja Snowden about his frustrations. Making fitness an adventure . Snowden, a German-born Colorado transplant, is a fitness enthusiast. She is known around the office for using her lunch breaks at work to escape into the Colorado trails for a quick 30-minute run. She became a person Kirimoto confided in throughout his fitness journey, whether it was about struggles he had at the gym or nutrition advice. ""I am a big believer of eating food in its purest form,"" Snowden said. ""He used to make fun of me when I ate an apple or vegetables for a snack, but as he started losing he changed his diet, and started eating pure, natural foods too."" When it came to running, Snowden told Kirimoto: ""We live in Colorado. One of the most beautiful states with many trails, and you need to take advantage of it,"" he recalled. That piece of advice inspired him to start running outside. The first run was tough. The ground wasn't as soft as the treadmill's belt back at the gym, and gravity seemed to pull him down, Kirimoto said. What he didn't expect from running outside was the sensory overload. He had lived in Colorado for more than 25 years, and this was the first time he had run outside. The vibrant colors of the leaves, the green grass, the blue sky -- it hooked him. As soon as Kirimoto started running Colorado's trails, he fell in love. Outside, he could finally breathe. His 15 minute runs transformed into 30 minutes and he gradually found himself running longer and faster. By February 2012, Kirimoto ran his first 5K race. ""I never entered a race before. I was alone and nervous. I had no idea if I was going to finish,"" he said. ""When I crossed the finish line ... I felt so fantastic."" That year he did 10 races. At the end of 2012, he had shed a total of 94 pounds and was now running as far as 6 miles on his running days. The following year, he took his trail runs to a new level and joined a local running group. In January of this year, he encouraged his wife and daughter to partake in physical activities as well. They had a day during the week where they would do short runs around the neighborhood, usually around a mile of jogging. Eventually those 1-milers with his daughter Sara became 2 miles; then she was regularly running 3 miles with him. In March, the father-daughter-duo entered a 4-mile race in Denver. Sara, now 7, was nervous because she had never run more than 3 miles before. But that didn't stop her from crushing the race, Kirimoto said. Sara ran without stopping, clocking a 12-minute and 39-second mile pace. Today, he and his daughter go on 6-mile runs together every Sunday. It's become a father-daughter bonding time for them. ""It is a million times more satisfying to run with her. To see my own child run and have fun is incredible,"" he said. By July, Kirimoto's weight was down to 168 pounds. He has lost a total of 102 pounds since 2010. Through all his achievements, Kirimoto has inspired a lot of his closest friends and co-workers, Snowden said. ""I think everyone is very impressed,"" she said. ""He made that choice for himself and for his family."" Passing that inspiration on to others is what motivates Kirimoto to continue staying in shape. ""So many people supported and inspired me at the beginning of my journey. Inspiration is contagious and a continuous cycle."" For others trying to lose weight, Kirimoto says don't forget to enjoy the journey you're on. ""Make (exercise) an exciting adventure,"" he said. ""Everyone is different. Consistency is the key to both weight loss and fitness. You may not see results immediately, but keep at it and you will be rewarded.""","At 270 pounds, Yusuke Kirimoto's weight was straining him physically and emotionally .

"Scott Brown, the former senator from Massachusetts who moved to New Hampshire to run in a more friendly environment, appears to be in a dead heat with Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a new poll shows. A CNN/ORC International poll out Monday finds Shaheen and Brown tied among likely voters, with both obtaining the support of 48% among 735 voters surveyed. A close race could mean bad news for Democrats, who are struggling to maintain control of the Senate. Keeping the seat in the Democratic column is crucial if the party want to maintain a slim majority in the Senate. One thing working in Shaheen's favor is her high favorable ratings. More than half of likely voters -- 54% -- have a favorable view of the first-term incumbent, while Brown's favorability is not as high. His rating currently sits at 46%. What could be a drag on Shaheen, however, is New Hampshire residents' opinion of the leader of her party. Thirty-eight percent of New Hampshire adults polled approve of the job President Barack Obama is doing, while 60% disapprove. Throughout the campaign, Brown has sought to tie Shaheen to Obama. The poll has a margin of error of plus or 3.5 percentage points. Paul, Clinton top presidential poll in New Hampshire .","Sen.

"Some documents in the JonBenet Ramsey case will be unsealed on Friday despite the objections of her father. A judge in Colorado on Wednesday ordered the release of 18 pages that were sealed after a grand jury went home in 1999 without charges being filed. In January, the Boulder Daily Camera, citing unidentified jurors as well as an assistant district attorney, said the grand jury had actually voted to indict JonBenet's parents on charges of child abuse resulting in death, but the district attorney decided not to move forward with the case. ""We do not have sufficient evidence to warrant the filing of charges,"" then-Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter said in 1999. He did not sign the indictment, according to the Daily Camera. There will be nine pages on John Ramsey and nine pages on Patsy Ramsey released this week, according to the order from Judge J. Robert Lowenbach. The Daily Camera reported Wednesday the release was a response to a lawsuit by one of its reporters and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press seeking the unprosecuted indictment. In 2008, then-District Attorney Mary Lacy wrote a letter to Ramsey, saying that new DNA evidence had cleared him, his wife and son. John Ramsey's attorney had written a letter last week to District Attorney Stan Garrett, requesting the documents be kept secret. ""Public release of the allegations of an unprosecuted indictment only serves to further defame (John Ramsey) and his late wife Patricia Ramsey,"" wrote Harold Haddon. But Lowenbach said state law requires official actions by the grand jury to be released. Ramseys' attorney: Grand jury 'likely confused' about JonBenet . ""The court is sympathetic to the position of Mr. Ramsey but has nonetheless concluded that as an 'official action' of the grand jury, the 'indictment' .... must be released,"" he wrote. Lowenbach denied Haddon's request to release all documents, saying it would set a precedent and hinder future grand juries from performing their jobs. On December 26, 1996, Patsy Ramsey said she discovered a three-page ransom note in her Boulder home. Police came and, later that day, found JonBenet's beaten and strangled body in the family's basement. The parents insisted an intruder killed their 6-year-old pageant queen, but no one was caught and no description was given. In time, the focus of Boulder police turned to the parents. Investigators didn't find any sign of forced entry. A paintbrush from her mother's hobby kit was used to tighten the rope that choked JonBenet. And the alleged ransom note was written from paper inside the house and referenced little-known details about the family's past and its finances. Despite the suspicions, the Ramseys were never named as suspects. But they were a focus of the grand jury, which first convened in September 1998. They heard from dozens of witnesses, considered 30,000 pieces of evidence. The district attorney's office, then led by Lacy, took over the case from Boulder police in 2002. Patsy Ramsey died from ovarian cancer in 2006 at the age of 49. Timeline: JonBenet Ramsey murder .","The 6-year-old girl was killed at home in 1996 .

"Greece may need to tap its eurozone partners for an extra 10 billion euros in funding as it faces up to a cash shortfall, the country's finance minister has said. Yannis Stournaras said ""if Greece needs additional support that will be of 10 billion euros, which is a very small amount compared with the previous memorandums."" The comments were in an interview with Greek newspaper Proto Thema Sunday and reported by press agency AMNA. A support package would come ""without new conditions,"" Stournaras said, as targets were already in place until 2016. Further, there would be no haircut on Greek debt, he said. The minister said the country did not yet have the two conditions to return to the bond markets -- a primary surplus and two consecutive trimesters of growth -- but would know by year's end if that had been achieved or could be next year. Stournaras' comments follow those made by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble last week, in which he said Greece would require ""another program"" of assistance to help it with debt financing costs. Greece has already had bailouts worth 240 billion euros. A Germany finance ministry spokesman said Schaeuble was referring to a eurozone pledge in late 2012 to consider ""further measures and assistance"" for Greece to help it achieve debt targets agreed to as part of the existing bailout program, which is due to end in 2016. According to a note from Societe Generale economists, Schaeuble had recognized the obvious, ""namely that Greece will need yet another assistance package."" However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel ""will want to keep discussions at bay until after the German election on 22 September,"" economist Michala Marcussen wrote. The International Monetary Fund had already recognized a funding gap of around 11 billion euros, Marcussen wrote, and more aid will be ""top of the agenda,"" after the election. Further, the note added, Greece ""in our opinion will need official sector debt forgiveness. Without this, we believe the economy will continue to struggle under the debt mountain, condemned to weak growth."" Greece's struggles come as Europe's recovery appears to be gaining traction thanks to a revival in activity in Germany, the region's biggest economy. The 17-nation eurozone emerged from its longest ever recession, growing 0.3% in the second quarter after 18 months of contraction. However, risks remain. France, the eurozone's second biggest economy, saw private sector output fall faster in August than July, with both services and manufacturing taking a hit. Unemployment rates have steadied but remain at record highs and will continue to weigh on consumer spending. It could also cause political instability in southern European states such as Greece and Spain. Greece, along with three other eurozone countries -- Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus -- remain dependent on rescue loans from the EU and International Monetary Fund.","Greece may need to tap its eurozone partners for an extra 10 billion euros in funding .

"The family of former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati has a message for Iran's new president: Their American son is not a spy, has never been one, and he should be released immediately from prison in Iran. ""I just ask -- I just want the president to consider us as an Iranian family, and that my husband is sick, and me as a mother I've suffered a lot, more than two years,"" said Behnaz Hekmati, Amir's mother, speaking in halting English. The family made a plea in an exclusive interview to CNN on the eve of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's first visit to the United States, where he will attend the U.N. General Assembly. Amir Hekmati's father, Ali, is ailing with brain cancer, and the family is imploring the Iranian government to release their son before time runs out for the elder Hekmati. ""Please just let Amir come home,"" said Behnaz Hekmati. ""Amir didn't do any crime, he didn't do anything. Just let him to come home and make his family happy again."" This month, Amir Hekmati, 30, wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry saying a confession he made to the spying charges leveled by Iran were ""false"" and ""based solely on confessions obtained by force, threats, miserable prison conditions, and prolonged periods of solitary confinement."" Hekmati's family said he had gone to Iran to visit his grandmother when he was arrested in August 2011, accused by Iran's Intelligence Ministry of working as a CIA agent. Born in Flagstaff, Arizona, then raised in Flint, Michigan, Hekmati graduated from high school and joined the U.S. Marines, where he served four years, becoming a rifleman and also serving in Iraq. His parents came to the United States in 1979 as the Islamic revolution spread across Iran. Two years ago Hekmati surprised his parents by telling them he wanted to visit Iran for the first time, to meet relatives he had never seen -- including his ailing grandmother -- and find his roots. ""We know there is a risk involved,"" Behnaz Hekmati said. ""We were always cautioning. And me, as a mother, because I know, I grew up in that country, I always cautioned about, you know, if something happened. But my kids, they said, 'Mom, my friend, they went, they came back, you know. And nothing's gonna happen.' And they never believe me, you know ... that it's very dangerous."" In August 2011, Amir Hekmati called his mother from Iran to say he was having the time of his life and he would be coming home soon. He told them he would leave two days after a final farewell party his Iranian relatives were having on August 29. That party came and went; Hekmati never showed up. For three months, no one in his family knew anything about Hekmati's whereabouts. Then one day in December 2011, Iranian state television aired Hekmati's purported confession he was a CIA spy, and announced that he was imprisoned. The suspect was ""tasked with carrying out a complex intelligence operation and infiltrating the Iranian intelligence apparatus,"" Iran's Press TV reported at the time. The family described being in total shock. ""That day we saw his face. And he was confessing ... he's a CIA spy, and I said, 'Wow,' "" his mother said. Behnaz Hekmati has said all along that her son's confession was fabricated and forced by his Iranian captors, a position the U.S. State Department supports. ""They had three months to make this story,"" his mother said. ""They knew from beginning this is a good catch, you know. ... He's a Marine."" She said she believes that's why the family was not initially allowed to talk to her son. ""That's why they didn't want us to talk to him. Because he's going to tell us the truth, what happened,"" Behnaz Hekmati said. ""And they just come up with this story. And an attorney told us same thing. He said, 'He didn't do anything.' "" Asked why it happened to his son, Ali Hekmati offered some thought. ""Naturally, we have some speculations that someone got jealous of him and didn't like the idea that he lives in America, and they are living over there in Iran,"" his father said. ""(That person) probably came up with some lies about him, called him a CIA spy, (because) that was his original charge."" The initial charge and detention has stretched to a two-year ordeal. Weeks after his on-air confession broadcast on Iranian television, Amir Hekmati was tried in an Iranian court and sentenced to death. Months later, Iran's Supreme Court overturned his death sentence and ordered a retrial. During his imprisonment, Hekmati spent 16 months in solitary confinement and went on a monthlong hunger strike. The Hekmati family has tried to bring public attention to Amir's plight, hoping to secure his release. Letter after letter, plea after plea, Amir's sister Sarah has struggled to get political support to intervene. Now that Iran has elected a more moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, in place of firebrand Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the family may have a better chance for his release. ""We just hope that we are reaching the ears -- especially now with this new transition in government in Iran -- the ears of the right people,"" Sarah Hekmati said. The State Department has said Amir Hekmati's imprisonment follows a pattern by the Iranian regime, which it says ""has a history of falsely accusing people of being spies, of eliciting forced confessions, and of holding innocent foreigners for political reason."" Hekmati is the latest in a series of Americans -- most of them Iranian-Americans -- to face arrest in the country in recent years: . â¢ In 2007, Iran arrested several Iranian-Americans --  including Kian Tajbakhsh, Ali Shakeri and Haleh Esfandiari, who were all later released. (That same year retired FBI agent Robert Levinson went missing after last being seen on Iran's Kish Island. Despite photos from his captors, his whereabouts are still unknown.) â¢ In May 2008, retired Iranian-American businessman Reza Taghavi was arrested on suspicion of supporting an anti-regime group. He was released more than two years later. â¢ In 2009, three U.S. hikers, also accused of spying, were arrested and ultimately released. â¢ Tajbakhsh was re-arrested in July 2009 amid post-election protests and a massive government crackdown. In March 2010, he was allowed a temporary release that was later extended, according to the website freekian09.org. The Iranian-American scholar is not allowed to leave the country, the website says. â¢ Journalist Roxana Saberi was arrested in January 2009 and convicted of espionage in a one-day trial that was closed to the public. She was freed in May that year. â¢ Literary translator Mohammad Soleimani Nia was detained in January 2012 . â¢ Christian pastor Saeed Abedini was reportedly detained in September 2012 . Last week, Iran released at least a dozen other political prisoners, including one prominent human rights lawyer. Then, on Monday, the government released dozens more prisoners. ""My wishful thinking was praying and hoping that Amir's name was among that list of people that were released,"" his sister Sarah said. ""It wasn't. But we're not going to give up."" Behnaz Hekmati made a tearful plea to Iran's new president, in English and Farsi, parent to parent, she says, to let her son come home. ""It's more than two years,"" she said, ""Just let Amir come home. ... Amir didn't do any crime, he didn't do anything. Just let him to come home and make his family happy again.""","Former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati has been imprisoned in Iran for more than two years .

"Outrage over the recent killing of a healthy giraffe at a Danish zoo misses a crucial point, an official argued. ""Conservation is not always simple. It's not always clean,"" said Lesley Dickie, executive director of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, a European body governing 345 institutions. ""I'm afraid that when we have limited space in zoos -- and it's limited because of problems in the wild, of course, and more and more animals need our help -- then we sometimes have to make these really tough decisions."" The Copenhagen Zoo said it ""euthanized"" the animal, named Marius, to avoid inbreeding. A veterinarian shot Marius with a rifle as he leaned down to munch on rye bread, a favorite snack. After a necropsy, the giraffe was dismembered in front of an audience that included children and fed to the zoo's lions, tigers and leopards. While some American zoo officials have said this is not standard practice for their facilities, Dickie said that this can be chalked up to a misunderstanding about what is ""normal in Danish culture"" and that zoological experts could do a better job of communicating. ""People have perhaps lost sight of the bigger picture and perhaps we as zoos have not been good at explaining why on very few occasions we need to make decisions like this,"" she said. Death threats . Staff at the zoo have received death threats as debate rages online over the killing, which took place despite a petition signed by thousands of animal lovers. Several staff members were targeted after the giraffe was shot Sunday, Copenhagen Zoo spokesman Tobias StenbÃ¦k Bro told CNN on Monday. He added that Bengt Holst, director of research and conservation at Copenhagen Zoo ""received threats via telephone and e-mails."" OPINION: Why zoo was right to kill giraffe . ""Our giraffes are part of an international breeding program, which has a purpose of ensuring a sound and healthy population of giraffes,"" Holst told CNN. ""It can only be done by matching the genetic composition of the various animals with the available space. ... When giraffes breed as well as they do now, then you will inevitably run into so-called surplus problems now and then."" As for the public necropsy, Holst said Monday that the zoo staff saw it as a learning opportunity because zoos have an obligation ""not to make nature into a Disney World,"" but rather show those interested in ""the real thing."" He further pointed out that most of the children in attendance brought their parents to the necropsy, not vice versa. ""It's not by accident that people came by here,"" he said. This may speak to the cultural gap Dickie referenced. At the Copenhagen Zoo, she said, all euthanized animals are autopsied, with some parts used for research and the rest of the animal fed to the zoo's carnivores. ""They strongly believe that the public should know how autopsies are done, what is the work of a vet in the zoo,"" she said. Shame on whom? That didn't dull the outrage sparked by the killing, as many people expressed their revulsion on the zoo's Facebook page. ""I find the killing of innocent baby giraffe Absolutely Barbaric. And to do it in front of children just desensitizes them to brutal killing of animals. SHAME ON YOU!"" Hope Welch posted Monday. However some users pointed out the hypocrisy of those who criticized the zoo without any understanding of the reasons behind the decision, or who ate meat without knowing its true origin. ""The level of crass hypocrisy demonstrated by the vast majority of comments on this thread is absolutely repugnant. Shame on you, armchair warrior, shame on you,"" wrote Matthew Ogden. OPINION: Why killing Marius doesn't stand up to scrutiny . More than 27,000 people had signed a ""Save Marius"" petition, appealing for a last-minute change of heart. ""The zoo has raised him so it is their responsibility to find him a home,"" author Maria Evans wrote on the petition site. When that petition failed, another petition popped up Monday, titled, ""Fire Bengt Holst From the Copenhagen Zoo For Having Marius the Giraffe Killed."" It had more than 16,000 signatures as of 3:30 p.m. ET. Zookeeper and TV personality Jack Hanna, who is also director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio, joined the chorus of outrage Monday, calling the Copenhagen Zoo's decision ""the most abominable, insensitive, ridiculous thing I've ever heard of."" He also questioned why the Copenhagen Zoo would keep breeding animals for which it didn't have room. The Columbus Zoo would never put down an animal in this manner, Hanna said, and he wouldn't condone showing an animal consume another animal to children. ""I know it's natural in nature. I'm not an idiot,"" he said, ""but I don't need to have some 2- and 3- and 6-year-olds -- they cannot understand at that age. You understand they don't understand nature. They haven't been to Africa, so that's what we do at the zoos. We try to educate people at zoos on what happens in the wild."" Which is exactly what Holst argues the Copenhagen Zoo was doing. As for exploring other purportedly more humane options, such as lethal injection or sterilization, Holst said that an injection would have contaminated about 200 kilograms of perfectly good meat, which was out of the question. He added, ""if we just sterilize him, he will take up space for more genetically valuable giraffes."" Options deemed not viable . Several zoos volunteered to take Marius. The UK's Yorkshire Wildlife Park, which said it has the capacity for an extra male, was among several places that offered to take him. Copenhagen Zoo said in a Q&A about the decision on its website, ""it is not possible to transfer the giraffe to another zoo as it will cause inbreeding."" The EAZA's Dickie said some institutions were ruled out because they did not meet her organization's strict protocols, and the Copenhagen Zoo wouldn't send Marius to an institution with ""lesser standards of welfare."" She further said that while EAZA members are ""saddened by the death of any animal in our care,"" the EAZA supports the Copenhagen Zoo's decision and reiterated the zoo's claim that ""transfer within our network does not represent a solution to the unsuitability of the individual animal for breeding."" In the EAZA's history, which dates to the early 1800s, its member zoos have put down only five giraffes, Dickie said. Numerous American zoos did not immediately respond to requests for interviews. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums declined a request, issuing a short statement from executive director Kris Vehrs stating that EAZA's ""programs and procedures vary from those of the AZA."" ""Through the AZA Species Survival Plan program, these methods include science-based breeding recommendations and cooperating to plan for adequate space,"" Vehrs said in the statement. The Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington, also declined an interview but said its birth plans were managed by the AZA Species Survival Plan. ""With each new animal birth, Woodland Park Zoo establishes a breeding and relocation plan that ensures a healthy and genetically sound future for the individual and species,"" the statement said. To claims that the Copenhagen Zoo acted irresponsibly by allowing Marius to be born if it had no room to house him, Dickie said the giraffe was born more than two years ago, and it's difficult to predict ""genetic kinship"" and a zoo's available space that far out. As for preventing the giraffes from breeding, that would violate the EAZA's standard of ""providing a behavioral repertoire as natural as possible"" for animals in captivity, she said.","Copenhagen Zoo staff get death threats .

"In a decision that goes strongly against Google, Europe's highest court has ruled search engine operators are responsible for the processing they carry out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties -- and that a form of the contentious ""right to be forgotten"" already exists. The European Court of Justice's ruling looks like a strong decision in favor of privacy and individual rights, and against the business models of search engines and certain aspects of freedom of speech. It means, for example, that if a web page can be found by searching for a person's name the search engine is responsible for the contents of that page. In certain circumstances, the search engine operator will be required to remove the search results and links to that page. Google can be expected to be very unhappy about this ruling indeed, particularly given that last year's Advocate-General's opinion suggested the reverse, and the court generally follows such guidance. What is the right to be forgotten? One of the perennial problems on the Internet is the idea that whatever appears is there forever. Stories that appear discreditable -- whether they are true or not, whether they are up to date or not, whether they tell the whole story or not -- can always be found and brought to the public attention. The ""right to be forgotten"" is the idea that we have the right to wipe the slate clean, to remove outdated stories such as spent convictions from the record. There have been versions of this right in a number of European countries -- France, Italy, Spain and Germany, for example -- for some time, but for the most part in pre-Internet forms, designed to stop newspapers republishing out-dated stories. The Internet has changed things so much that some suggest the law needs to catch up. For most people, Google is the main way people find information -- so if you can prevent Google from providing links to a story, to a great extent you prevent people from reading that story. Many cases have been brought against Google -- more than 200 in Spain alone -- demanding that links to stories be removed. The particular one that is the subject of the court's ruling concerned a real estate auction of property belonging to a man who at the time had social security debts. It was a story from 1998, but still discoverable via Google, and despite the fact proceedings relating to the debts had been resolved many years before. The man successfully sued both Google Spain and Google Inc. in the Spanish courts but Google appealed, and it is on that appeal that today's ruling was made. The ruling covered three issues. Firstly, it looked at territory issues, delving into issues such as the ability for Google to be sued, as Google Inc, who operates the search engine and where the data is processed. Secondly, it looked at whether Google be treated as though it controls the data on pages reachable through its search engine -- or whether it is a kind of neutral intermediary. Thirdly, it considered if current law provides for a right to be forgotten that is enforceable on search engines. On all three issues, the court effectively ruled against Google. If a search engine's business is established in a state, then regardless of where the data itself was actually processed, data protection law applies. In effect, if Google looks to make money in Spain, the search engine itself is subject to local data protection laws. On the data processing issue, the court ruled that Google was responsible as controller and on the third issue, that this responsibility implied that Google would have to remove links and results where appropriate. Specifically, the court ruled that individuals' fundamental rights ""override, as a rule, not only the economic interest of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in finding that information upon a search relating to the data subject's name."" This, essentially, is a right to be forgotten. What happens next? For Google, this result creates a headache, and potentially huge costs. It could open the door to a floodgate of actions, each of which will need resolution. Google will no longer be able to claim immunity. The ruling also needs to be seen in the context of the reform of the data protection regime in Europe. The Data Protection Directive dates back to 1995, before Google was even founded -- and a new Data Protection Regulation has been going through the tortuous processes through which EU law is formed for the last few years. It appears close to completion -- it passed through the European Parliament in March this year -- and includes a formalization of a right to be forgotten. The story is not over, however, and it is not clear how this ruling will feed into the last stages of the debate. That a form of right to be forgotten is deemed to already exist in the current law could bolster the campaign of those who wish for a full ""right to be forgotten"" in the new regime. The potential chilling effect of the ruling could make those who oppose the right redouble their already considerable lobbying efforts to have the right removed from the new regulation, thus rendering this ruling irrelevant. As it is, however, the court has made a ruling that could have a huge impact on how search engines operate, and how we all use the Internet.

"Just days after the militant group the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria said they killed hundreds of Syrians, dozens of Iraqi Christian families are now fleeing the ISIS-controlled city of Mosul, hoping to avoid a similar fate. On Friday, the al Qaeda splinter group issued an ultimatum to Iraqi Christians living in Mosul -- by Saturday at noon (5 a.m. ET), they must convert to Islam, pay a fine or face ""death by the sword."" A total of 52 Christian families left the city of Mosul early Saturday morning, with an armed group prohibiting some of them from taking anything but the clothes on their backs. ""They told us, 'You to leave all of your money, gold, jewelry and go out with only the clothes on you,'"" Wadie Salim told CNN. Images obtained exclusively by CNN show that the phrase ""property of ISIS"" scrawled in black paint on a number of the homes that were abandoned. Some of the families headed for Irbil -- which is currently controlled by Kurdish forces -- and others toward the Dohuk province. The majority went to Dohuk, which is 140 kilometers (87 miles) north of Mosul. ""We did not know how to act,"" said another Mosul resident, Um Nazik. ""Are we going to get killed?"" ISIS was able to take over large swaths of land due to the lack of centralized authority in both Iraq and war-torn Syria. The Sunni militants hope to establish an Islamic state throughout the region it currently controls. Salman al-Farisi, the ISIS-appointed governor of Mosul, declared that any family that planned to on staying in Mosul and not to converting to Islam would be required to pay 550,000 Iraqi dinar (about $470). Letters distributed to Christians in Mosul in recent days said  ISIS's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, agreed to allow those who didn't embrace Islam or pay a special jizya tax to leave. ISIS is notorious for its brutality -- the group is so violent that al Qaeda has attempted to distance itself from its former affiliate. On Thursday in Syria's Homs province, the militant Sunni group killed 270 people after storming and seizing the Shaer gas field, the group said.

"(CNN) -- Imagine you are welded to the sofa at home about to watch a third match in a row. You have been drinking throughout the day, but reach for another can of cold beer and fill your glass. But the vessel you are drinking from says that your alcohol intake has exceeded safe levels and urges you to reconsider. Rather than a desperate government intervention, this is the concept of the Vessyl 'smart cup' -- a groundbreaking addition to the field of consumer health technologies, which has launched for pre-orders. The sleek 13-ounce design is fitted with a sensor that analyzes the molecular content of drinks in real time, and then displays selected nutritional information such as sugar or alcohol content on the side of the cup. In a live demonstration for CNN, inventor and CEO of parent company Mark One, Justin Lee used the Vessyl to identify a range of beverages. The cup -- synced to his iPhone -- took only a few seconds to recognize a specific brand of smoothie, and was able to discern an exact flavor of Frappuccino. Moments later, sugar and calorie content flash up. Users can adapt the device to their personal needs, says Lee. ""We want this to be a product for what matters to you. People who want to lose weight will care most about the calories. I work out so I'm more interested in protein. People can also be mindful of caffeine consumption -- to be sharp but not jittery."" The device can be set to multiple ""lenses"" to meet a variety of needs, from weight loss to improved sleep. It tracks cumulative consumption so that users can observe and improve their patterns. Lee hopes that Vessyl will be used in conjunction with existing health technologies that record personal details such as heart rate and body mass index to optimize consumption choices. The mobile app includes a feature for a tailored hydration program based on such personal details. There is a medical imperative behind the Vessyl. ""Sugar-sweetened beverages are the number one source of calories"", reported a recent survey from the US Center for Disease Control. Soft drinks are increasingly identified by health organizations as a leading cause of obesity, with major efforts to restrict their consumption and improve public understanding of the high sugar levels. Other products are beginning to offer forms of molecular analysis for our food, but Smith believes that usability will prove a trump card. ""We wanted this to be as easy as possible for consumers, we were completely focused on making the interaction simple. The data has to be clear and actionable."" Certainly, one need not be a technology guru to make use of the Vessyl, the ease of which owes much to the collaboration with award-winning designer Yves Behar, creator of the Jawbone. The only action required of the user is to tilt the cup and read the numbers displayed on the side of the cup. The only maintenance required is ""quick rinse"" between drinks, and charging is delivered via a wireless coaster. The size and shape is conventional with a ""flick-to-open"" spill-proof lid. The Vessyl has heavyweight support, with leading innovators at Google and Apple among its admirers. ""People will at first be blown away, and then they are going to expect everything else in the world to be able to see its contents and materials the same way"", says Mike Beltzner, head of mobile at Pinterest. While some may still prefer not to know the gory details of everything they consume, innovations like the Vessyl are making it harder than ever to live in ignorance.

"Under the care of ""optimistic"" doctors, Jahi McMath -- whom a judge and other doctors have declared brain-dead, over her family's objections -- is ""improving"" days after her release from an Oakland, California, hospital, her family's lawyer said. However, barring a misdiagnosis, medical experts say the teen's condition can't improve if she is truly ""brain dead,"" because there's no way to come back to life once brain activity ceases. Attorney Chris Dolan detailed some of what's happened to the 13-year-old girl since her release Sunday from Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland. After initially ""doing poorly she is stabilizing,"" he said, adding that the teen underwent tracheotomy and gastrostomy tube procedures. ""She is doing very well and getting the treatment she should have gotten 28 days ago,"" Dolan said Wednesday, referring to what happened to Jahi after a December operation. ""Doctors are optimistic that her condition has stabilized and that her health is improving from when she was taken from (the Oakland hospital)."" The family hasn't said where the eighth-grader currently is. Dolan has declined to say if she had been transferred to another facility and, if so, to describe that facility. Instead, they have chosen to lie low as they continue their efforts to care for Jahi. Dolan said the family needs to ""heal up from this whole experience"" and have ""some quiet time"" away from media questions. ""(The) family is seeking to focus attention on Jahi,"" added the lawyer. CNN could not independently verify Dolan's account about what's happened to the young California teen. Jahi underwent a December 9 operation at the Northern California hospital to remove her tonsils, adenoids and extra sinus tissue. Opinion: Let parents decide if teen is dead . Doctors had recommended the surgery to treat pediatric obstructive sleep apnea, a condition that made her stop breathing in her sleep and caused other medical problems. The teen girl was alert and talking to doctors after the procedure, even asking for a Popsicle because her throat hurt. That was a relief in some ways because she'd expressed concerns to her family about the surgery, fearing she would never wake up from it, her uncle has said. Due to privacy laws, hospital officials have not been able to discuss Jahi's case in detail. In the hospital's intensive care unit, however, the girl started to bleed, her family has said, and she went into cardiac arrest. Days later, she was declared brain-dead. A judge later sided with the hospital  in declaring her dead. The family, however, did not agree. That conflict played into a weeks-long battle between the hospital, which wanted to remove Jahi from a ventilator, and her family, who believed she was showing signs of life. The entire ordeal fueled a sweeping national debate about what legally and ethically constitutes death. Some medical ethicists have said the case has fed into a misperception that ""brain death"" is not death; that somehow, the body can live on, and that is life. It's also sparked fierce emotion, and that is another reason the family is keeping quiet about where the girl will be taken. ""We've had people make threats from around the country,"" Dolan, who said he and the girl's uncle have received such threats, has told CNN. ""It's sad that people act that way."" Why brain dead means really dead .","Jahi had successful procedures after leaving an Oakland hospital, lawyer says .

"A real protest, a fake Google employee, a viral video and some shiny buses have brought attention to the growing tensions between San Francisco's moneyed tech-sector workers and the city's working poor and middle class. Private bus lines snake through San Francisco, transporting employees in climate-controlled, Wi-Fi-enabled, cushioned comfort to their jobs at large Silicon Valley companies. Offered as a free employee perk by Google, Facebook, Apple, Yahoo and other companies, the large buses have become a symbol of income inequality here and a lightning rod for resentment. On Monday, organizers staged a protest at a Google bus stop in San Francisco with signs that read ""Warning: Two-Tier System"" and ""Public $$$$, Private Gains.""  A video taken at the scene showed a confrontation between what seemed to be a protester and a Google employee who yelled, ""Why don't you go to a city that can afford it? This is a city for the right people who can afford it."" Only, in a very San Francisco twist, the Google employee was a fake, played by union organizer and sometime Occupy protester Max Alper, who described the stunt later as ""political theater to demonstrate what is happening to the city."" Some skeptics on Twitter immediately detected that something was off about the confrontation, saying the so-called Google employee's rants were too perfectly aligned with the stereotype of the spoiled, overpaid techie. But the clumsy stunt spread online has called national attention to the issue. Critics claim that the buses block bike lanes and traffic, and frequently squat in existing public bus stops. They also say the money that companies sink into the lines could be spent on improving existing public transportation for everyone. It's similar to the private-vs.-public school argument in many cities. People who can afford to segregate themselves do so at the expense of the public institutions that depend on the support of people from all income levels. Residents who don't work for cash-rich tech companies are left to take San Francisco's less-reliable 101-year-old public transit system, MUNI, with its mix of older buses, trains and trollies that link up with the BART and Caltrain train networks. As rents rise, people who can't afford to stay in the city are pushed farther out, and their dependance on reliable public transportation to get to their jobs increases. That's no small percentage of the city's population. In San Francisco, 23.4% of residents are below the poverty threshold, according to the Public Policy Institute of California and the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality. In fairness, the buses are not evil on wheels: They're meant to keep cars off the road to minimize congestion and pollution. ""The private shuttle buses are a visible symbol of economic inequality, so they are a convenient place for people to vent their frustration. But they are not the problem,"" said Gabriel Metcalf, executive director at Bay Area urban policy organization SPUR. ""The problem is that our public transit system isn't good enough and that, for historical reasons, many of the tech companies are located in suburban campuses that don't have transit."" Google actually has showed a great interest in solving transportation problems and is working on a driverless car that also aims to reduce traffic. But, like with private buses, the technology will mostly benefit those who can afford it. Transportation is just one of a number of issues related to the tech industry that have inflamed tensions in the city. Soaring housing prices and gentrification, also blamed on the influx of high-paying tech jobs, have longtime residents worried that the city will be overtaken by the newly wealthy, pushing out middle- and working-class residents. They worry that without its communities of artists, activists and immigrants, San Francisco's unique character and history will be paved over for new condos with perks like dog-washing areas and music rehearsal rooms. ""A city without its nurses, its teachers, its artists, its waiters, its bus drivers, its cops, its musicians and writers and grandmothers as residents is a monoculture -- as sterile as a forest of a single commercial tree species,"" Timothy Egan wrote in a recent New York Times opinion piece. San Francisco's potential for growth is stunted by bodies of water on three sides. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 825,863 people live in San Francisco County, compared with 8.3 million in all of New York City, which has about twice the landmass. Low vacancy rates and surging demand have increased the median rental rate in San Francisco to $3,414. Home prices in the area have risen 22% in the past three years. The recent demand for housing is heavily fueled by the influx of high-paid technology employees. Software engineers make an average of $127,143 a year at Google, $121,507 at Facebook and $124,630 at Apple, according to Glassdoor.com. These young workers need someplace to live, and many choose to reside in vibrant San Francisco and commute to their sleepy company headquarters farther south on the peninsula. Matters are made worse when people associated with the industry voice controversial opinions about the class divides. A couple of days after the bus protest, the masses got the blabbermouth, tone-deaf techie they craved when Silicon Valley entrepreneur Greg Gopman posted his thoughts on the city's homeless population to Facebook. ""There is nothing more grotesque than walking down market st in San Francisco. Why the heart of our city has to be overrun by crazy, homeless, drug dealers, dropouts, and trash I have no clue,"" he wrote in the rant. Gopman went on to compare the homeless to hyenas and call them a disgrace. ""There is an area of town for degenerates and an area of town for the working class. There is nothing positive gained from having them so close to us,"" he said. He has since taken to his Facebook page to apologize. These types of outbursts happen every so often on social media and blogging platforms like Medium. In August, entrepreneur Peter Shih included the homeless in his list of 10 things he hates about San Francisco, along with unattractive women and bad public transit. Obviously, these individual entrepreneurs do not speak for the Bay Area's entire population of tech workers. But their outbursts are the sort of attitude Silicon Valley would prefer not to be associated with. The buses may be the most visible and convenient targets for anti-gentrification activists, but the underlying problem won't be fixed if buses stop blocking traffic. Some potential solutions include getting tech companies to relocate nearer to public transit and getting the city to invest in improving the current transportation system, according to Metcalf. Other improvements he suggests include raising the minimum wage, adding housing for all income levels and improving education so the people growing up in the city can compete for those big-money jobs nearby. Metcalf is optimistic that the fast-growing economy can benefit all of San Francisco. ""We just need to take the next steps and make sure we do everything possible to connect everyone with this growing economy and to make a new round of investments in infrastructure, which will lay the foundations for the future,"" he said.","A staged protest of private buses brings attention to income inequality .

"From fighting terrorism to processing payments in the blink of an eye, facial recognition is set to change our ideas on privacy. A number of exciting developments in the field could even push its toughest critics to reconsider. ""The more people get out of it, the more they'll surrender to it,"" says Manolo Almagro, senior vice president of digital for TPN Inc. Almagro believes that people will only embrace a technology if the benefits outweigh privacy concerns. Facial recognition is a computer-based system that automatically identifies a person based on a digital image or video source -- which is then matched to information stored in a database. Often used in fictional TV-series such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, it is soon set to become a real-life tool for fighting crime. In 2014, the FBI will roll the technology out across the U.S. after pilot testing is completed in some states. Facial recognition is a key part of the agency's ambitious $1 billion Next Generation Identification System (NGI) -- a state-of-the-art biometric identification system that also includes iris scans, DNA analysis and voice identification. The mission is to reduce terrorist and criminal activity by improving and expanding biometric identification as well as criminal history information services. UK-based Dr. Chris Solomon is an advocate for the technology too. A professor at the University of Kent, Solomon has created an ""electronic sketch artist"" system that has changed how UK police identify criminals. His method is currently used by 90% of British police and in more than 30 countries. He explains: ""The key advantage here is that it allows people to respond to faces they see rather than having to break it down into component parts."" Credited with helping to solve hundreds of crimes, his facial composite software identifies suspected criminals in a new way. The system, EFIT-V, allows victims and witnesses to select the best and worst matches from a group of computer-generated faces. Based on their responses, the computer eventually ""learns"" what type of face they are after and displays options accordingly. But facial recognition technology isn't always so straightforward. Identifying faces from closed-circuit-television (CCTV) footage can be challenging -- as demonstrated after the Boston Marathon bombings earlier this year. Marios Savvides, Director of the CMU CyLab Biometrics Center, told CNN's Tom Foreman that low resolution can be especially challenging. ""When you look at images collected from standard CCTV footage, the faces are way too small,"" he said in May. Savvides explained that it is especially difficult matching off-angle images to frontal facial photographs. The solution Savvides's team has created is a system that transforms flat photos into 3D. He argues the ability to recreate a suspect from all angles will improve the reliability of facial recognition and also help police track down suspects faster. The luxury retail sector appears to see potential in facial recognition too. According to the Sunday Times, dozens of stores and hotels are testing the technology in the U.S., the UK, and the Far East. UK-based company NEC IT Solutions, which also specializes in identification of terrorists and criminals, has created a system that analyzes the faces of potential customers as they enter shops. The system then checks this information against a database with celebrities and valued customers -- to help stores identify potential big spenders. Once a match is made, the software alerts staff via computer, tablet or smartphone. It can even provide details such as clothing size and shopping history. Almagro believes that consumers are likely to volunteer information about themselves online if it enhances their shopping experience and helps provide recommendations that ""make sense."" A Finnish company, meanwhile, aims to streamline sales by using facial recognition technology for payments. Helsinki-based Uniqul has patented a system allowing payments to be made without wallets or smartphones. ""I've always been fascinated with how people purchase things and started thinking about the ideal way to pay as you walk into a store,"" says Ruslan Pisarenko, the inventor of the idea. Anticipating potential customer concerns, Pisarenko says that he isn't too concerned the technology could be marred by security risks. ""We've been thinking about this from day one. Facial recognition is secure by nature and is fundamentally a biometric technology since you need to be in the store to use the technology."" But not everyone has embraced facial recognition with open arms.  In 2011, Facebook introduced a controversial feature which automatically identifies faces in uploaded photos by comparing them to other tagged pictures. It was rolled out without warning -- a move that backfired in the EU as regulators and privacy campaigners forced the social networking site to turn off the functionality. In spite of this, Facebook recently announced plans to extend facial recognition to profile photos in other parts of the world. ""Our goal is to facilitate tagging so that people know when there are photos of them on our service,"" Facebook Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan told Reuters. Amie Stepanovich, the director of the domestic surveillance project at the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington D.C. argues that Facebook has the largest biometric database in the world, which could eventually compromise its users. In an interview with NPR, Stephanovich said: . ""No matter how much a company attempts to protect your privacy, if they're collecting information about you, that information is vulnerable to government search.""","Soon, you could pay for goods simply by showing your face to a scanner .

"Who killed and decapitated an 88-year-old Georgia man, and where is his 87-year-old wife? Russell Dermond's death and Shirley Dermond's disappearance are mysteries detectives are trying to unravel -- and fast. ""We need to assume, or at least pray, that Mrs. Dermond is still alive, and we desperately need to know her whereabouts,"" Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills said Thursday. Investigators are treating her disappearance as an abduction, he said. There is no indication she's a suspect, and there's ""plenty"" to indicate she was taken, he said. Her pocketbook, cell phone and vehicle were all at the million-dollar waterfront home where her husband's headless body was found. Investigators believe Russell Dermond was killed between last Friday and Sunday, and they're still searching for his severed head, Sills told reporters, describing the case as ""very unusual"" and the most frustrating homicide of his career. ""I don't think it's a random incident. I think for whatever reason these people were singled out for this,"" Sills said. ""They live in the most exclusive neighborhood, or one of the most exclusive neighborhoods, in this county. ... They're on a cul-de-sac in a gated, multimillion dollar resort community that we have no crime in."" Sills said he can't recall a burglary in the neighborhood in his 18 years as sheriff. The Dermonds' friends hadn't heard from them in days and went to their home in the upscale, gated, lakeside Great Waters community, where they found Russell Dermond in the garage. ""I don't know that that's the murder scene, but there's obviously blood,"" Sills said. Authorities have searched Lake Oconee in the vicinity of the Dermonds' home -- turning up only a lawn chair and a Christmas tree -- and sent cadaver dogs into the nearby woods, to no avail, Sills said. Police have also spoken to neighbors, family and friends. So far, the investigation has turned up little to shed light on the crimes. Investigators aren't aware of any enemies the couple had made, or any reason someone would target them, he said. ""If I had a good, solid lead, guess what? I wouldn't be standing here talking to you,"" the sheriff told reporters. ""The only person who's not a suspect is Sheriff Sills, because I know where I was."" 'This has been a shock' Residents described Reynolds Plantation -- a tony resort community about 75 miles east of Atlanta, which also boasts a Jack Nicklaus signature golf course and a Ritz-Carlton Lodge -- as a safe enclave where people were comfortable leaving their doors unlocked. ""There is no crime in this area, no crime whatsoever,"" Lillian Butterworth told CNN. ""Nothing has ever happened here before, so this has been a shock to us."" Added resident Johnny Wagoner, ""It's just a total sense of sadness and confusion on how this could happen here -- and obviously a great deal of concern for Shirley and our prayers and hopes that she will be found."" The 3,300-square-foot home where the Dermonds have lived since 1994 is valued at more than $1 million and sits on Lake Oconee, in the bucolic Great Waters neighborhood of Reynolds Plantation. Off a moderately trafficked rural road, a divided, two-lane road lined with trees and a white fence winds through large, green expanses of tall grass, past a guard house into the neighborhood. At this point, investigators don't know whether the suspect or suspects approached the home by land or via the lake. Sills said it isn't uncommon to see fishermen casting lures in the middle of the night. Without any clear leads as to Shirley Dermond's whereabouts, he said, investigators are now asking the public for help. Shirley Dermond is 5-foot-2 and weighs 148 pounds. She has gray hair and blue eyes. And she is believed to be in danger, Sills told local media. Anyone with more information should call the Putnam County Sheriff's Office at 706-485-8557. Details of the case have baffled investigators. ""You've got such unusual circumstances here,"" Sills said. ""If it's an abduction, you would expect some sort of extortion demand. If it was an assassination, you'd think both bodies would be there. And then you have, totally, nothing in their background that indicates anything like this, and then the area where it happened is not indicative of any type of homicide."" Couple was 'sweet as can be' A Georgia Bureau of Investigation source confirmed the bureau was conducting Russell Dermond's autopsy but wouldn't comment further. The FBI also is assisting and, likewise, reticent, saying only that it ""is providing limited support based on the needs and requests from Putnam County authorities,"" according to Stephen Emmett, spokesman for the FBI's Atlanta office. Meanwhile, the sheriff said, rumors have been flying in the small community. He told CNN earlier Thursday that information suggesting authorities had found parts of Shirley Dermond's body were ""totally false"" and asked CNN to ""help stop the false reports, as they are interfering with our investigation."" Little else is known about the couple, both of whom were born in New Jersey. Police and friends are at a loss for why they would be the targets of such violence. Compounding the mystery is that the home was pristine. There is no sign of a break-in, a scuffle or anything missing. Their vehicles were at the home, police said. Russell Dermond has paid taxes on a 23-foot boat, which Sills said the couple recently sold, and Dermond reportedly owned fast-food restaurants. Tax records connect him to a Wendy's and a Chick-fil-A. The Rev. David Key of Lake Oconee Community Church said he has known the couple for about eight years and counts them among his church's 350 attendees. He's ""baffled"" as to why anyone would commit such crimes against them, he said, as they were grounded, ""beloved in the community"" and ""sweet as can be."" They were active in the church and family-oriented, he said. The Dermonds, who have been married 68 years, had three adult children, he said, as well as grandchildren, though he wasn't certain how many. ""Number one, we are devastated by Russell having died and the violence around that,"" Key said. ""And not knowing what happened to (Shirley). ...

"There is a ""night and day"" difference between HealthCare.gov on October 1 and the same site on December 1, Jeff Zients, the top administration official responsible for improving the problem-plagued Obamacare enrollment site, said Sunday on a conference call with reporters. Deadline Day: Will Obamacare site work? Zients and Julie Bataille, spokeswoman for the federal agency charged with developing and operating HealthCare.gov, said the website now works ""smoothly for the vast majority of users."" The administration said the site can now handle 50,000 concurrent users and 800,000 consumer visits a day -- two capacity goals for the portal that date back to its launch two months ago. And Bataille said the site was now allowing ""in the zone of 80%"" of users to successfully complete a health care enrollment. In short, after a concerted effort to improve HealthCare.gov, the administration said Sunday that the online Obamacare enrollment portal now essentially meets all of the previously stated goals for the website. Obamacare site fix: 5 things to look for . A day after the administration's self-imposed deadline for improving the website, Zients detailed the turnaround efforts he's been leading. Work has fallen into three broad categories: creating a new management structure for the site to improve decision-making and accountability; putting in place hardware upgrades to increase the system's ""redundancy, reliability, and scale""; and compiling a prioritized ""punch list"" of bugs and software improvements -- 400 of which had been completed by Sunday. Prior to the turnaround effort, Zients said, management of the enrollment site had been plagued by slow decision-making and a lack of accountability. These issues were addressed by creating a new management structure led by general contractor QSSI, which was tapped to oversee the site's operations, and the creation of a 24-hour, rapid response team that constantly monitors the site and the experience users are having on it. These management changes were intended, Zients said, to give the government-run website ""the velocity and discipline of a high-performance private sector company."" Upgrades, trouble-shooting, and old pizza . On the hardware front, Zients said improvements have been made to the registration database, which plays a part in the front-end experience consumers have using the site; new servers and upgraded memory have been added; additional ""application environments"" are now online; and the system's firewall has been upgraded. These changes have made ""the underlying infrastructure of HealthCare.gov much stronger today,"" Zients said, adding that some of the critical upgrades were completed as late as Friday evening, when the site was down for 11 hours for maintenance as this weekend's deadline approached. Zients likened the effect of the hardware upgrades to widening a highway's on-ramp, effectively taking the site from two lanes to four. On the software front, Zients said 50 of the bug fixes completed during the turnaround effort had been done ""just last night"" during another period of maintenance. Going forward, Zients anticipates there will still be other bugs and software fixes for the rapid response to handle. All these changes have made a noticeable difference in HealthCare.gov's operating metrics, Zients said. The site's average response time -- the average time it takes for the system to respond to an action by a user -- is down from eight seconds to under one second in the past three weeks, said Zients. The site's average error rate is also down, according to Zients, with the system hitting a rate of 0.75% on Friday. And the system's ""uptime,"" a measure of system stability, is consistently surpassing 90%. Zients said the creation of the rapid response team means necessary fixes can now usually be made within an hour instead of the hours it used to take. ""We've doubled the system's capacity and the site can now handle its intended capacity,"" explained Zients, summing up the net effect of the turnaround effort he has led. This means that two months after it originally launched, HealthCare.gov can now handle 50,000 concurrent users and 800,000 consumer visits a day. If more than 50,000 people attempt to use the site at any one time, the site now has a queueing feature that will e-mail users with tips about when to return to the site at a less congested time and a link that will take them to the front of the line. ""Nothing like this (was) in place"" in October, Zients said Sunday. With all the recent improvements, administration officials conceded Sunday that there is still work to be done. ""As with any website, the team will continue to address bugs and glitches,"" Zients said. In addition, work on the back end of the site, which is of critical importance to insurance companies issuing policies to consumers, still needs to be completed. The administration is still working with insurers on the ""834"" transaction forms generated by the system, said Bataille. ""We're working with issuers on a daily basis and will continue those conversations,"" she said, adding that the site's management team would have more information about this issue with the data generated by the system on upcoming weekdays. ""There are still a number of problems with the back-end systems,"" Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for health insurance industry trade association group America's Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement to CNN. ""Insurers are still getting enrollment files that are duplicative and have missing or inaccurate information. In some cases they are not getting the enrollments at all."" Insurers: Site glitches persist . As the administration's self-imposed deadline for improving the troubled site has come and gone over the weekend, Republicans on Capitol Hill have been unusually quiet, after months of frequent criticism of HealthCare.gov and of broader changes to the health insurance market taking effect because of Obamacare. Website progress garners muted reaction from Congress . Top House Republicans took issue Sunday primarily with Obamacare's changes to the insurance market rather than with the enrollment site's troubled history. GOP Obamacare playbook: Spread negative perception . ""This isn't just about a broken website, it's about a fundamentally-flawed law,"" Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said in a statement. ""Whether or not Americans can logon to Healthcare.gov, they are losing the health plans they like, the doctors they've always relied on, and -- to add insult to injury -- facing higher costs as well."" A spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor had a similar message. ""Millions of Americans being informed that the health care plans they liked are being canceled -- despite the President's repeated assurances otherwise -- and being forced to pay higher premiums, deductibles, or both, are a much greater priority than a broken website,"" Cantor Deputy Chief of Staff Doug Heye told CNN. ""Besides,"" added Heye, ""based on past performance, it would be prudent to wait before determining that the website truly is fixed."" Comments from Steel and Heye echoed those of Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, just a day earlier. Thune, who chairs the Senate Republican Conference, argued Saturday that Americans will continue to face problems with Obamacare's reforms ""(r)egardless of whether the website is fixed by the administration's revised deadline."" ""These are problems that no IT specialist working through the Thanksgiving holiday can fix,"" he added. Obama: People do think I'm trustworthy . CNN/ORC Poll: Are Obamacare's flaws fixable?

"(CNN)One week after AirAsia Flight QZ8501 disappeared from air traffic control radar, the search for victims and more of its wreckage was underway Sunday,  officials said. Waves are expected to be 1.5 to 2 meters high, said Bambang Sulistyo, head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency, at a press conference in Jakarta. Sulistyo said that if the weather is relatively good, divers will be sent to the location where four objects were detected on sonar. There are 89 divers on standby and divers from Russia will join the effort, he said. Search teams have found four large pieces of debris believed to be parts of the aircraft. Sulistyo said the latest objects --  including one that is 18 meters (59 feet) long -- were located by sonar in the priority search area. Searchers came upon the metal parts after spotting an oil slick late Friday. Bad weather conditions -- including 15-foot waves and strong underwater currents -- prevented divers from conducting searches Saturday, meaning no additional bodies were recovered. Sunday's forecast called for more favorable conditions, he said. Who was on the plane . Sinking bodies . Anton Castilani is eager to get the rest of the victims out of the waters before they sink to the bottom of the sea. He is in charge of identifying them and said that gases in the bodies that keep them afloat disperse after a few days in the water. It's been nearly a week already. The plane went missing on Sunday. He urged families to be patient with his team as they identify loved ones. He wants to do his work right. ""We have to make sure that we have to return that right body to the right family,"" he said. Decomposition also slows his work down. ""The later the dead bodies come to you, the harder you work,"" he said. His team uses fingerprints and dental records as well as DNA to find out who they have recovered. â¢ Hayati Lutfiah Hamid . â¢ Grayson Herbert Linaksita . â¢ Kevin Alexander Soetjipto . â¢ The Meiji Thejakusuma . â¢ Hendra Gunawan Syawal . â¢ Khairunisa Haidar Fauzi . â¢ Jie Stevie Gunawan . â¢ Juanita Limantara . â¢ Wismoyo Ari Prambudi . â¢ Tony Linaksita . â¢ Shiane Josal . â¢ Lim Yan Koen . â¢ Yongki Jou . â¢ Indra Yulianto . â¢ Hindarto Halim . â¢ Jou Brian Youvito . Recoveries, identifications . On Friday, the USS Sampson, which the U.S. Navy has deployed to help, recovered some bodies. Altogether, the number retrieved rose to 30. A limited number of them will be autopsied to determine the cause of death to aid the investigation, an Indonesian official said Saturday. But many families don't want autopsies done. ""For the sake of the investigation, we agree, and it is accepted by Interpol, to perform autopsies on the pilot, co-pilot and some randomly selected passengers,"" said East Java Police Chief Anas Yusuf. Six of the plane's victims have been identified. The first, Hayati Lutfiah Hamid, was laid to rest Thursday. AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes said he was traveling to Surabaya, Indonesia, to bring home the body of flight attendant Khairunisa Haidar Fauzi. ""I cannot describe how I feel. There are no words,"" he said on Twitter. Search priorities . Finding the fuselage and black box of the Airbus A320-200 has priority for the 59 diving teams searching underneath the waves. Russia has joined the effort with 22 underwater teams along with a search plane and a cargo jet. The searchers are concentrating on a 1,575-square-nautical-mile zone that officials believe is the ""most probable area"" to find the remains of the aircraft. Anguish revisited: Relatives of MH370 victims speak . Here's where things stand on Flight QZ8501: . The flight . What we know: QZ8501 took off early December 28 from Surabaya, bound for Singapore. Roughly 35 minutes into the flight, the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to avoid bad weather. Minutes later, the plane disappeared from air traffic control's radar. What we don't know: What happened on board after contact with the plane was lost. No distress call was received. Some experts speculate that the aircraft experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift. Other theories include a lack of information about the plane's position or storm damage to the engines. How can a modern airliner vanish? The investigation . What we know: The ""black boxes"" are key. Actually, they're orange and should be in the plane's tail. A lab in Jakarta will analyze them, if they are recovered. The batteries powering the ""pingers"" that send acoustic signals have only about 24 days of power left. What we don't know: What destroyed the plane. Investigators will need to use information gleaned from the flight recorders and clues from the wreckage to try to find out. ""The more bits I can put into my mosaic, the better my picture will be,"" aviation safety expert Michael Barr said. The ones who missed the flight . The plane and the pilots . What we know: The Airbus, operated by AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate, had accumulated about 23,000 flight hours in about 13,600 flights in six years. The plane's last scheduled maintenance was November 16. Flight 8501's veteran captain, Iriyanto, 53, had 20,537 flying hours, 6,100 of them with AirAsia on the Airbus A320, the airline said. The first officer, Remi Emmanuel Plesel, 46, had 2,275 flying hours, a reasonable amount for his position. Indonesian authorities are looking in to why AirAsia was flying that particular route on that particular day; the country's transport ministry claims that AirAsia was permitted to fly it only on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. AirAsia said it will cooperate with the inquiry and suspended all service from Surabaya to Singapore in the meantime. What we don't know: Did technical problems or human error have anything to do with the crash? A major aviation database registers 54 incidents involving the A320. Some A320 accidents and incidents involve fan-cowl detachments, landing gear collapse, bird strikes and pilot error, an expert said. These cause disasters only in very rare cases. Security threat? Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta issued a security alert Saturday after being ""made aware of a potential threat against U.S.-associated hotels and banks in Surabaya."" A State Department official, however, told CNN that there was ""no knowledge of any connection between âthis threat and the Air Asia flight."" No additional information was given regarding the nature of the threat, but the Embassy recommended ""heightened vigilance and awareness of one's surroundings when visiting such facilities."" CNN's Paula Hancocks, Kevin Bohn and Joseph Netto contributed to this report. Journalist Yosef Riadi and translators Michelle Anugrah, Azieza Uhnavy  and Edi Pangerapan also contributed.","Eighth day of the search for the AirAsia flight has begun .

"Several times a day, helicopters land and take off from the helipad above Seattle's Fisher Plaza. But this time was different. The sound -- what the lead investigator described as an ""unusual noise"" -- gave away Tuesday morning that something was amiss. What followed immediately afterward proved it, as a news helicopter tumbled to the ground and burst into flames, with those flames spreading to several parked cars in its path. ""I looked and the helicopter was almost immediately pitched sideways and off balance,"" construction worker Bo Bain told CNN affiliate KING. ""And he kind of just nose-dove over the trees, and clipped the top of the trees and crashed just on the other side of the street there."" The two people aboard the helicopter died in the crash, and another person who'd been in one of the three vehicles that caught fire was critically burned, officials said. The incident rattled a vibrant part of the Emerald City, falling a few feet from the Space Needle and near the Experience Music Project, Children's Museum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation offices, a quarter-mile away. Why did what had started out as a routine takeoff turn into a disaster? Authorities offered little clarity just after the crash, but promised to find out. ""We want to understand what actually happened, so we can understand what we can do in the future to prevent this from happening,"" Mayor Ed Murray said. Man leaves car 'in flames,' bleeding . The 2003 Eurocopter AS350 was owned and operated by Helicopters Inc., a company that specializes in providing news-gathering copters. While KING indicated on its website that it sometimes made use of the helicopter, it was being leased at the time by CNN affiliate KOMO. The helicopter had just come from Covington, Washington, and was planning to head next to Renton, said Dennis Hogenson with the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation. ""A witness described as the helicopter lifted off from the building and began to rotate counterclockwise and subsequently crashed,"" he said. Daniel Alejandro Gonzalez told CNN affiliate KIRO that he had gone outside to smoke a cigarette when he heard the helicopter's engine turn over. ""About 15, 20 seconds later, I heard it, it sounded like in the movies -- when it goes into slow motion, when you hear the ding, ding, ding ... and after that I heard it collapse. I heard it hit the ground, and that's when I looked up."" Within a couple of seconds, the scene was ablaze. Video showed what was left of the helicopter immersed in flames, as well as a line of fire in the street that engulfed several vehicles. One man emerged from a car that was ablaze, with ""his shirt ... in flames, his head ... bleeding,"" Gonzales said. ""He walked about 20 feet and he collapsed."" The injured man -- in his late 30s -- was taken to Harborview Medical Center in critical condition, with burns over 50% of his body, fire department spokesman Kyle Moore said. A hospital spokeswoman, Susan Gregg, said doctors at the level-one trauma center had sedated the man, put him on a ventilator and were administering fluids. They were still trying to determine the extent and severity of the burns, she added. Gregg said the man may have helped reduce the severity of his injuries by rolling on the grass, extinguishing the flames. Media mourn loss of their own . Bain described the next few minutes as ""chaotic,"" with people abandoning their cars and one driver who ""made a U-turn and got out of Dodge as quickly as possible."" The area was already abuzz with commuters heading to work but few tourists, since the Space Needle was still more than two hours from its scheduled opening. Still, while it could have been worse, the crash had a devastating effect -- especially among those who knew the victims. Murray described KOMO workers as being ""in a state of shock."" KOMO identified the victims as Bill Strothman, a retired KOMO photographer who was working as a freelancer, and Gary Pfitzner, the pilot. Strothman had earned 14 Emmy Awards during his career; his son works as a photographer for the station. ""He was a guy who really knew how his pictures could tell a million words,"" KOMO news anchor Dan Lewis said of Strothman, who also worked for the helicopter leasing company that was operating the aircraft. ""... He was such a gentleman, a true gentleman."" Pfitzner too was a familiar face at the station. ""He always had a smile on his face,"" said anchor and reporter Molly Shen. ""He loved what he did, loved to be able to fly and be up there above the city and see things from a perspective that most of us don't get to see."" Seattle's mayor, Murray, met Tuesday with Strothman's family, having known the father and son. ""It just brought it home in a very personal way,"" the mayor told reporters. ""... It just reminds us both that we are public servants. And people put themselves at risk in your business."" 'Just a part of the tail and burnt-out metal' Arriving firefighters found lines of blazing fuel in the street and thick, black smoke covering the area, with ""wreckage strewn across the lawn along with wreckage across the street,"" said Moore, the fire department spokesman. The first responders' prompt and ""pretty outstanding"" actions, as Murray described them, helped prevent a horrific situation from becoming worse. Ten tons of sand were dumped on the street to absorb the helicopter's fuel, with vacuum trucks later heading to clean up the site, said the mayor. The Space Needle closed due to the crash, as did the city's monorail and parts of streets in the area. The helicopter did not appear to any have struck any nearby buildings before its fiery end. ""What we have left is basically just a part of the tail and burnt-out metal from the main chassis of the helicopter,"" Moore said. Soon after the crash, investigators were interviewing witnesses, assessing the scene and gathering the wreckage in order to literally piece together what happened at an off-site location. Hogenson, from the NTSB, said that his agency would issue a preliminary report in about five days and a full report -- including the probable cause of the crash -- within a year. The president of Helicopters Inc., Stephen Lieber, issued a statement offering his company's condolences. ""We mourn their loss and suffering and our thoughts and prayers are with them,"" he said. ""We will cooperate fully and completely with the National Transportation Safety Board and provide to it whatever information it wants in order to assist it in its work in determining what happened.""","Lead NTSB investigator says helicopter made ""unusual noise"" before crash .

"(CNN) -- In my home town of St. Louis, a petition has gained traction calling for police to wear body cameras that capture everything in front of them while they are doing their jobs. This would be just a step beyond the idea of putting dashboard cameras on all police cars, which some police agencies around the country have started doing. The reasoning goes that with these cameras, we might deter police misconduct and get better answers to disputed questions like what happened in the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson. In a seemingly unrelated development, a team of entrepreneurs is working on a new nail polish that women can wear to detect the presence of date rape drugs in drinks. Cameras and chemistry, so the stories go, can deter police brutality and date rape. So far so good. After all, we are living in an age when technological and ""innovation"" are touted as a kind of Holy Grail for all kinds of problems. ""There's an app for that,"" as the famous ad for Apple's iPhone 3G told us in 2009. But if we dig a little deeper, the reality is that complex social problems require more than technological Band-Aids, no matter how innovative the fix seems. Let's look at the nail polish first. Putting aside the irony of asking women to prevent rape by wearing nail polish, the reliance on such a thing puts the burden of preventing rape on individual women in bars rather than focusing on the crime of date rape itself. We don't think the solution to violent crime is for people to wear bulletproof vests, nor do we require fireproof homes as a solution to arson. Empowering potential victims is certainly important, but it shouldn't be our first resort to the problem of date rape. Then there's the proposal of putting cameras on police. If there had been a camera on the police car driven by the officer in the Michael Brown shooting, it might have captured video of the event. To be fair, there's some evidence that video cameras in controlled settings like prisons can deter both police and inmate misconduct. Cameras can prevent bad behavior by police or criminals, and we should think hard about deploying them in appropriate cases. Certainly a judicious use of cameras might be a better use of tax dollars than tanks or sniper rifles or scary black uniforms. But how we deploy technologies matters at least as much as whether we deploy them. If we put cameras on police cars or officers, can the police pause the video? Can they edit it? Can they take the cameras off? How long would such video records be stored and under what conditions of public access? If public access is limited, then the police could selectively release video to advance their version of disputed facts. If public access is easy, we run the risk of exposing the private lives of ordinary people who have done nothing wrong. But as any lawyer or sports fan knows, video evidence can be disputed and police who spend their days in front of the camera might develop the skills to look good on camera even when they might not be doing good in reality. The rhetoric surrounding both the police cameras and nail polish suffers from what technology writer Evgeny Morozov has termed ""solutionism,"" the fallacy that every social problem is best suited to a technological fix. Date rape and Ferguson conflicts are results of broad cultural forces. When we deal with issues involving race, gender, civil rights and civil liberties, there's no silver bullet. Technology can have adverse effects, too. Cameras, for instance, may deter some misconduct but can also create a culture of surveillance that chills our civil liberties, and can be used to invade privacy and create revenge porn, with infamous results, from the Tyler Clementi suicide to the recent mass disclosure of celebrity private pictures. Police brutality, profiling, racism and economic inequality are cultural and social problems, and we shouldn't expect easy fixes like cameras to solve them. Too much praise for special nail polish can lead us to ignore the underlying problems of date rape and assume they will just go away. Let's move away from easy fixes and think hard about real solutions.","In Ferguson, the idea of putting dashboard cameras on all police cars has come up .

"He says it's his last fight. And it's been his hardest. After 43 years in Congress, New York Rep. Charlie Rangel said the campaign for his 23rd term is his final one. The 84-year-old ""Lion of Harlem"" wants two more years in Washington, but on Tuesday, voters will decide if his time is up. He's a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and the former chair of the powerful Ways and Means Committee. But the legend of Harlem politics is on shaky ground. Rangel running for 23rd term in the House . Rangel says he's ready this time . He's been bruised before. In the 2012 Democratic primary, victory came by a thin margin. Rangel beat state Sen. Adriano Espaillat by fewer than 1,100 votes. The congressman said he didn't put up much of a fight. ""I didn't have a campaign last time. When he told me he was running I was in the hospital in Columbia Presbyterian with a viral infection in my spine."" This time, Rangel said he's ready. ""Well, I don't have a walker. I don't have a spinal injury."" Rangel has also had more time to recover from a humiliating censure in 2010 from the U.S. House of Representatives following a series of ethics violations. 2014 midterms: What's at stake . Gearing up for Round 2 . Since 2012,  Espaillat has been gearing up for Round 2. This time, the underdog said he's counting on an upset and making comparisons to one of the biggest ones ever in boxing: . ""Sonny Liston was a big, bad bear when he got into the ring, but (Muhammad) Ali was faster, smarter than him,"" Espaillat said. ""He was able to draw circles around him, and he shook up the world and he changed boxing."" If voters want a change now, it may be a measure of how much the district has changed since Rangel went to Washington in 1971. Harlem's rich African-American history now seems distant . Neal Schumacher knows the streets of Harlem as well as anyone. He gives walking tours, and he often points out the fact that the neighborhood is, ""...not the Harlem that I grew up in, but a Harlem I embrace."" A falling crime rate has accelerated real estate development in the neighborhood, but affordable housing remains among the most pressing issues for many with roots in the community. ""People are concerned about gentrification, about rising housing costs, about some of the mom and pop shops closing. About being able to afford to live in the community where you are now,"" said Schumacher. Harlem has long been known for its rich African-American history. But to Harlem historian Jacob Morris, that past feels more distant today. ""In the 20th century Harlem was incontrovertibly...the cultural capital of Black America. ...Is it still? I would say now it's the custodian of that great history."" Both say racial and ethnic politics not part of race . Today, the demographics are different. So is the district itself. Part of the Bronx was added to Harlem's district before the 2012 primary. The 13th Congressional District now has a Hispanic majority. If elected, Espaillat would become the country's first Dominican-American congressman. Both candidates insist that racial and ethnic politics shouldn't determine the outcome of the race. ""We never had a political battle in my congressional district in 43 years based on where you were born or what religion you have,"" Rangel said while campaigning Saturday. 2014 midterms: Complete coverage . Turnout could be key . According to a NY1/Siena College poll released the week before the primary, the vast majority of voters said the race or ethnicity of the candidates makes no difference to them, . The same poll shows Rangel has a 70-point lead with blacks and a 5-point lead with whites, while Espaillat has a 24-point lead with Latinos. Overall, the poll gives Rangel a 13-point lead (47%-34%) against Espaillat. Insiders suggest the race is tighter than that and too tough to predict. A key factor: turnout is expected to be low. Both campaigns will have to battle to get voters to the polls on Tuesday. The congressional race is the only item on the ballot.","Rep. Charlie Rangel is running for 23rd term in the House .

"Charges have been filed against a now-former sheriff's deputy in upstate New York after an online video showed him cursing and acting aggressively toward a man who didn't want his car searched, according to a Monday press release from the Saratoga County Sheriff's Office. Shawn R. Glans was charged with official misconduct and second-degree harassment, said Saratoga County Sheriff Michael H. Zurlo. Glans, who resigned from the force, was released on his own recognizance, Zurlo said. The video shows the deputy cursing at the man, who repeatedly tells the officer there's no reason to search the vehicle. ""I wasn't in my car when all this was happening,"" the man says. ""Why don't you want to search like my house or something?"" ""Let me see your f***ing keys,"" the deputy fires back. The video shows the deputy approaching the man. ""You want to f***ing resist?"" the deputy says. ""I'm not resisting,"" the man says. Then there's the sound of a slap. The video, which has been viewed thousands of times on YouTube, doesn't show the source of the sound. The man who says he recorded the video told CNN affiliate WTEN that the officer hit the man. ""He gave him a good whack on the back of the head, and after that he got the keys,"" the man said. ""I just thought it was really wrong, the way he went about it."" The deputy also had harsh words apparently aimed at the man recording the video, telling him, ""I'll rip your f***ing head off."" The press release from the sheriff said: ""The actions of Sergeant Glans both as a police officer and a supervisor were completely inappropriate and unwarranted and not condoned in any fashion by the Saratoga County Sheriff's Office. His actions served no purpose in the furtherance of the investigation that he was conducting and have greatly undermined the public trust of this agency.""

"At least 37 hostages died in the terrorist seizure of a natural gas facility in eastern Algeria and the subsequent special forces assaults on it, the country's prime minister said Monday. Five other hostages are missing from the In Amenas complex and could be dead, Prime Minister Abdul Malek Sallal said. Read more: Power struggle: The North African gas industry targeted by militants . Before Sallal's statement, officials from other countries and companies that employed foreign workers at the sprawling plant had confirmed 29 hostage deaths. Seven of the 37 confirmed dead haven't been identified yet, according to the prime minister. Those who have been identified include seven Japanese, six Filipinos, three Americans, three Britons and one Algerian, officials from those countries said. Some 29 militants also died, while three were captured, Sallal said, according to the state-run Algerian Press Service. The standoff ended Saturday, after four days, when Algerian special forces stormed the complex for the second time. The government said it did so because the militants were planning to blow up the installation and flee to neighboring Mali with hostages. ""If it exploded, it could have killed and destroyed anything within 5 kilometers or further,"" Sallal said. Read more: Bloody Algeria hostage crisis ends after 'final' assault, officials say . Militant says Mali unrest spurred assault; others say it followed ample planning . The crisis began Wednesday when Islamist extremists in pickup trucks struck the natural gas complex some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the Libyan border, gathered the Westerners who worked there into a group and tied them up. After taking over, the well-armed militants planted explosives throughout the complex, Sallal said. They came from eight countries: Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Mali, Niger, Canada and Mauritania. Algeria's military talked with the militants, but their demands that prisoners in the North African nation be released were deemed unreasonable, according to the prime minister. The country's special forces waged the assaults to free the hostages and were backed by the Algerian Air Force. Read more: Nations scramble to account for missing after Algeria hostage crisis . At one point, the militants tried to flee the compound in vehicles that carried explosives and three or four hostages as human shields, Sallal said. At least two of the vehicles flipped and exploded during the attempt, he said. Sallal said the terrorists had entered the country from northern Mali, where Malian and French authorities are battling Islamist rebels. One-eyed veteran Islamist fighter Moktar Belmoktar has claimed responsibility for the hostage-taking on behalf of his al Qaeda-linked group, according to Mauritania's Sahara Media news agency. Belmokhtar -- who was among 12 defendants, five like him still on the run, who were the subject of an Algerian court hearing Monday related to their terrorist involvement -- said the attack was in retaliation for Algeria allowing France to use its airspace to battle Islamist militants in Mali. But regional analysts believe the operation was too sophisticated to have been planned so quickly, and Sallal said the hostage scheme had been hatched over months. Algerian minister says gas plant will restart, foreign workers will return . The targeted gas facility is run by Algeria's state oil company, in cooperation with foreign firms such as Norway's Statoil and Britain's BP. Some 790 people worked there, including 134 foreign workers, Algeria's prime minister said. Read more: Algerian forces seek 'peaceful' settlement of dramatic, deadly hostage crisis . British Prime Minister David Cameron said Monday the effort to evacuate workers is complete and that U.K. officials are now focused on bringing the bodies of slain British hostages back home. Cameron praised Algerian forces for their work in ending the crisis, despite concerns from some nations earlier that the Algerians had unnecessarily put hostages at greater risk. ""This would have been a most-demanding task for security forces anywhere in the world, and we should acknowledge the resolve shown by the Algerians in undertaking it,"" the British leader said. ""The responsibility for these deaths lies squarely with the terrorists."" Such Islamist militant activity is not new to Africa, including recent violence in Mali and Somalia. Algeria's status as Africa's largest natural gas producer and a major supplier of the product to Europe heightens its importance to those who want to invest there. That interest is coupled with pressure to make sure foreign nationals, and their business ventures, are safe. Energy and Mining Minister Youcef Yousfi, who a day earlier insisted Algeria can keep its gas facilities secure without foreign forces' help, said he believes the targeted gas facility will be back running ""in the shortest possible time"" and that foreign workers will soon return. Several foreign companies, including Statoil and BP, evacuated their workers from Algeria after the incident. ""I don't think that these workers have left definitively Algeria,"" Yousfi told reporters, according to the Algerian Press Service. ""Maybe some left ... to reassure their families, but I want to ensure that no company or no worker permanently left the country."" Nations mourn dead, try to account for others . Here is a breakdown on the status of hostages from around the world who were involved in the crisis: . Colombia . Colombia's president said one of its citizens is presumed dead. France . No known French hostages are unaccounted for, the defense ministry said. A man identified as Yann Desjeux died after telling French newspaper Sud Ouest  that he and 34 other hostages were treated well. It was unclear what led to his death. Japan . Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Minoru Kiuchi and officials from JGC, a Yokohama-based engineering firm, saw and identified the bodies of seven Japanese citizens killed in the crisis, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga announced late Monday. Three Japanese remain unaccounted for, according to Suga. Malaysia . Three hostages were on their way back home, state media reported. There is a ""worrying possibility"" that another is dead while a fifth is unaccounted for, the agency said. Read more: Algeria attack may have link to Libya camps . Norway . Five Norwegians are missing, while eight are safe,  according to Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. Philippines .

One Romanian lost his life while four others were freed, the country's foreign ministry said. United Kingdom . Three British citizens were killed, the Foreign Office said Sunday. Three other British nationals and a UK resident are also ""believed dead,"" according to British officials. The Foreign Office confirmed the name of one slain hostage, Garry Barlow, in a statement Monday. ""Garry was a loving, devoted family man, he loved life and lived it to the full. He was very much loved by myself, his sons, mother and sister and the rest of his family and friends and will be greatly missed,"" the Foreign Office quoted his wife, Lorraine, as saying. Twenty-two other Britons who were taken hostage have safely returned home. United States . U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland on Monday said three Americans had been killed and identified them as Victor Lynn Lovelady, Gordon Lee Rowan and Frederick Buttaccio, who had been previously identified. Seven U.S. citizens survived the crisis, added Nuland, who declined to comment further citing privacy considerations. Erin Lovelady described her father Victor, of Nederland, Texas, as a laid-back, understanding and loving man. ""I want people to understand how wonderful my dad was, and how great a dad he was, and how much he's going to be missed by me and my mother and my brother,"" Erin Lovelady told CNN affiliate KFDM, describing herself as ""daddy's little girl."" Gwen Eckholm called Rowan -- her former neighbor in Mesa, Arizona, who recently moved to eastern Oregon -- a ""very intelligent, super-nice guy"" who told her he felt safe working in Algeria.

"(CNN)Duty. Honor. Country.  These words were chiseled in granite above me, printed on the diploma in my hands and engraved on my class ring. I had just completed a four year regimen that had been honed over 174 years to be difficult. The year was 1976. I had just graduated from West Point. In return for four years of education, I owed the nation at least five years of Army service. I became a ""service member."" But like most of my peers, I wasn't really thinking much about service. At age 21, I was more focused on the adventures ahead -- of becoming a good officer and leading soldiers. After 34 years in the U.S. military, I learned that Armies are built soldier-by-soldier, platoon-by-platoon.  Like the bricks in a house, the soldiers in each unit contribute to a great military, just as the citizens of each neighborhood help determine whether the nation stands strong.  Nothing is more important than developing in our citizens a sense of responsibility to each other -- and to the nation. The Franklin Project is an initiative that I chair at the Aspen Institute. Our goal is to have 1 million young Americans each complete a civilian service year by 2023. We envision an American version of national service that is voluntary but socially expected. Today, as part of this effort, I'm calling for a few cities across the country to step up and lead by becoming Service Year Cities. What if, upon graduating from high school, every young person in these cities is given an opportunity to complete a service year with other young people? Each city could commit to a plan with an initial goal of having at least 25% of their graduating students from high schools stay in their communities to serve for a year. Like many Americans, I believe our country would benefit greatly if we were to unite around a commitment to service. Creating model towns and cities of service across America could provide powerful local examples that capture our collective imagination and create ripple effects for more service opportunities. I've seen the benefits firsthand. In early 1977, I joined the 82nd Airborne Division and found myself leading a platoon of paratroopers.  Most of my platoon came from modest backgrounds and had joined the still young ""Modern Volunteer Army"" for financial reasons.  It was a built-in cultural clash, as I, the son and grandson of career officers, fresh from the cloistered world of West Point, was put in charge of a group of young men who came from different socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. But despite our differences, we all came together to solve complex problems.  In the process, often haltingly, we watched each other grow -- first into comrades -- and slowly, almost imperceptibly, into professionals.  Together we had become real soldiers and real citizens. I'm not the first soldier to notice the unique advantage we gain as a country when mechanisms are put in place to bring people of diverse backgrounds together around shared values.  In 1796, President George Washington wrote  that it was ""of the highest importance ... that (in) the juvenal period of life, when friendships are formed, and habits established, that will stick by one; the youth ... from different parts of the United States would be assembled together, and would by degrees discover that there was not that cause for those jealousies and prejudices which one part of the Union had imbibed against another part."" President Washington's words ring even truer in today's America, where we see disconnectedness starkly within our own communities. If I were graduating from high school today, I'd be less likely to have experienced the world alongside someone different from me. My high school would be less diverse than it was in 1970. I would likely live around people who made just as much money as my parents. The creation of Service Year Cities around our country would enable us to make progress toward overcoming these divides while solving pressing local problems. As part of this Service Year City effort, cities would commit to growing service year opportunities for young people and include this in the city's strategic planning, as Mayor Dayne Walling has done in Flint, Michigan. New York City plans to double its number of service year opportunities from 5,000 to 10,000. Another template for a Service Year City could focus on mobilizing universities and community colleges to commit to a plan that integrates a service year into their students' experience. Tufts University and Tulane University have both created such programs within the last year. Depending on the needs of your city, young people could be mobilized in one or two major projects, or placed in an array of organizations across the city. The young people in your city's service cohort would also have an opportunity to interact with one another through social events in the city, joint training, and educational seminars. The participants would be part of an alumni group that could serve as a civic resource for your city for decades to come. This will not be easy, but it is completely possible. I learned from my decades as a soldier that the best solutions are designed by people closest to the problem. The experience would make these young people better community members, employees, citizens and leaders. Our partners at the National Conference on Citizenship are building a Service Year exchange, an online platform to connect all the young people, service organizations and funders. In part to assuage the concerns of parents worried that a service year could get their kids off track, the Franklin Project, and others are working to ensure that a service year becomes an accelerant to getting a job and gaining admission to college. Imagine if your town were able to look at a huge cohort of your young people as proudly as our country looks at our men and women in uniform. I fundamentally believe that Service Year Cities have the power to transform our culture of service and ultimately create a country in which all young Americans have the opportunity to serve.  This experience would not just change the trajectory of one young person's life for the better, but the trajectory of our cities and our nation as a whole.

"(CNN) -- There are plenty of times when I literally wish I could take a hammer to the portrayal of girls and women in the media. In a new ad, a little girl gets to do just that. The ad is by the provocative toy maker GoldieBlox, which captured national attention last year when its ad encouraging girls to ""disrupt the pink aisle"" and become inventors went viral and led to a Super Bowl commercial. In this newest ad, a girl, armed with a hammer, breaks rank from the other girls, who are dressed in pink, wearing high heels and picking up Barbie dolls, and silences a machine showcasing a robotic ""1984""-like figure who is repeating, ""You are beauty and beauty is perfection."" ""Take that, beauty talk"" is no doubt the message of the ad, before revealing a new toy for girls: A girl action figure holding a hammer. ""I think it's fantastic. Girls have idolized Barbie for way too long,"" said Laura Beyer, a mom of two grown children in West Allis, Wisconsin. ""This finally allows them to break the mold."" Ellen Williams, co-founder of the blog Sisterhood of the Sensible Moms, had an equally positive reaction. ""It was about girls being more than their exteriors,"" she said. ""My 16-year-old daughter curls her hair and does her nails every week, but she also is in the robotics club and takes AP calculus."" The more representations of what it means to be a girl, the better, said Avital Norman Nathman, editor of the motherhood anthology ""The Good Mother Myth."" ""While I'm not sure if one ad has the ability to undo all of the other ads out there that send the opposite message, it at least shows that there are choices out there and not one prescribed way to be a girl,"" said Norman Nathan, who is also founder of the blog The Mamafesto. The ad does have its share of critics too, especially those who think a company trying to bust gender stereotypes might be pushing some at the same time. ""It doesn't surprise me that the doll, despite its proclamation that it is here to break the beauty mold, still has a slender figure and long full blond hair,"" said the children's television host who goes by the name Miss Lori. But here's my question: Do ads like the one by GoldieBlox really empower girls? We have seen a string of female empowerment ads recently -- from the incredibly popular ""Run Like a Girl"" campaign by Always, which has more than 50 million views on You Tube, to Pantene showcasing how often women apologize to the Dove ""Beauty Patch"" and HelloFlo's hilarious ""Camp Gyno"" about a girl getting her period for the first time. Audrey Mann Cronin, a communications consultant, said she used the Pantene ad on how women apologize much more than men during a recent presentation to illustrate the need for female empowerment. ""We need to empower girls and women to find their own authentic voice, but sometimes we all need permission -- and inspiring ads can be very effective as they drive conversation,"" said Mann Cronin, who is also the founder of the blog, ""Say It Like You Mean It."" The ads themselves, many women say, may not be empowering girls, but it's the conversations they are sparking that actually do. ""I've sat down with my 9-year-old daughter to watch many of these ads, and we always end up having great conversations afterwards about how not all girls are the same and it's OK for girls to like and be anything they want,"" said Sharon Choksi, co-founder of Girls Will Be, a company providing empowering clothing for girls. ""Those seem like simple concepts but all our kids are bombarded every day with messages that try to tell them otherwise and try to place limits on them based solely on their gender."" Raising awareness about key issues affecting girls and young women is a big plus of the ads, said Micky Morrison, a mom of two and founder of BabyWeightTV. ""So that girls can start to see how they are being manipulated in subtle ways and discriminated against, so that they learn to stand up for themselves."" Diana Graber teaches digital literacy in schools and recently wrapped up a middle school unit on gender stereotypes in the media. She says young people are stressed and angry about ""the unhealthy and unattainable images they are assaulted with daily ... so why not 'flip the switch' and empower young children with strong messages"" like the one in the latest GoldieBlox ad, said Graber, co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital literacy site for parents, children and educators. WATCH: The Dove beauty patch: Bad for women? The ads can get people talking, said Melissa Atkins Wardy, author of the stereotype busting book ""Redefining Girly,"" but ""empowerment can't be sold or purchased."" ""True, authentic empowerment comes from changing ideas, behaviors and comments that fail to give a girl full credit for who she is as an individual,"" said Wardy, who also runs a business providing gender empowerment clothing called Pigtail Pals & Ballcap Buddies. More and more women do seem to be demanding that companies showcase an authentic view of girls and women in their advertisements, and are rewarding those companies that do. According to a recent online survey by the women's lifestyle media platform SheKnows, 71% of women believe companies should be held responsible for using their advertising to promote positive messages to women and girls. 52% of the more than 600 women surveyed said they bought a product because they liked how the brand and its advertising portrayed women and girls, while 54% said they had stopped buying a product because they were unhappy with how women were portrayed by the brand. ""Our users have indicated clearly that they want ads that celebrate authenticity and aspiration for women,"" said Samantha Skey, chief revenue officer for SheKnows. ""And most importantly, they will get behind the brands who empower their girls."" The bottom line is no doubt one motivator for corporations in getting behind gender empowerment ads. Tackling issues such as the continued disparity between men and women in certain fields such as science, technology, math and engineering is another. Verizon recently launched an ad called ""Inspire Her Mind,"" designed to send a message to parents about encouraging girls to pursue careers in traditionally male-dominated fields and compete for the higher-paid tech jobs in the future. ""Corporate engagement isn't optional when it comes to solving pressing social issues,"" said Rose Kirk, president of the Verizon Foundation and vice president of global corporate citizenship at Verizon. ""We are missing a big opportunity and failing these girls if we don't find creative ways to close the gender gap quickly."" While we talk about the impact these ads could have on girls and young women, there is also the thinking by some that they are more important for boys and men. ""We need more images of girl power and realistically beautiful women sewn into the fabric of entertainment and commercialism in order to reverse the longstanding socializing of our boys and men to expect girls to be girly and women to be sexy first and sometimes only,"" said Miss Lori, who is also a social media strategist and Babble.com contributor. ""My girls know they are strong and capable. They just need the rest of the world to get out of their way and let them be what they were born to be: powerful people, not just powerful girls."" Do you get think ads like the new one by GoldieBlox truly empower girls? Tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.","New ad by the toy maker GoldieBlox smashes the idea ""beauty is perfection""

"A strong earthquake damaged hundreds of homes in southern Mexico Tuesday and rattled residents hundreds of miles away in the nation's capital. The quake had a magnitude of 7.4, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and its epicenter was about 15 miles (25 kilometers) east of Ometepec, Guerrero. Mexican authorities reported the magnitude of the quake as 7.8. At least 500 homes in the southern coastal state were damaged, Gov. Angel Aguirre told reporters. The temblor injured at least 11 people, Mexican Interior Minister Alejandro Poire told reporters. Nine of the injuries occurred in Oaxaca state, which borders Guerrero and also suffered damage from the quake, he said. Two people were injured in Mexico City, about 200 miles (320 km) from the quake's epicenter. Guerrero residents felt aftershocks hours after the quake, which the USGS said had a depth of about 12.4 miles (20 km). ""There are many cracked ceilings, many houses that collapsed,"" Francisca Villalva Davila, Ometepec's comptroller, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Authorities were still surveying damage Tuesday evening, Poire said. Reports differed about the earthquake's impact. Officials reported that at least 800 houses had collapsed in the town of Igualapa, the Guerrero state government said in a statement. Later Tuesday, the head of Guerrero's civil protection department said officials had confirmed 200 damaged homes in the town. That number could increase when assessments of the area continue Wednesday, he said. Residents rushed into the streets after feeling the temblor in Mexico City. Tourists and residents also felt the earthquake in the resort city of Acapulco, located about 100 miles (200 km) from the quake's epicenter. Calderon said that there were no immediate reports of serious damage, and that the nation's health system was operating normally. ""There are some broken windows, much fear, much panic,"" he said. The USGS initially reported the magnitude of the quake at 7.9, but later revised that figure downward to 7.4. Residents in the southwestern states of Oaxaca and Guerrero and the eastern state of Veracruz reported that phone service had been knocked out. Multiple houses collapsed in the Ometepec area, Aguirre told CNN affiliate Televisa. Government helicopters were surveying the area, he said, and officials were preparing shelters for displaced residents. Authorities in Mexico City were surveying buildings, schools and hospitals to evaluate damage, Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said. One person was injured when a pedestrian bridge fell on a minibus during the quake, he said. Some buildings had cracks and broken windows, he said in a Twitter post. Earthquakes are a frightening experience for the more than 20 million residents who live in the sprawling metropolis, where about 10,000 people perished after a massive quake in 1985. The city, built on volcanic ash and clay, is particularly vulnerable to temblors. A spokeswoman told reporters that U.S. President Barack Obama's eldest daughter, who was on a spring trip with classmates in Mexico about 100 miles away from the quake's epicenter, was not injured. ""In light of today's earthquake, we can confirm that Malia Obama is safe and was never in danger,"" said Kristina Schake, a spokeswoman for first lady Michelle Obama.","Interior minister: 11 people are injured nationwide .

"(CNN)It's uncomfortable, talking about death. And that's as true for the profession devoted to staving it off as it is for the rest of us. ""I learned about a lot of things in medical school,"" surgeon Atul Gawande begins his New York Times best-selling book, ""Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters at the End."" ""But mortality wasn't one of them."" In his book, Gawande, a Harvard professor who practices endocrine surgery at Brigham and  Women's Hospital in Boston, argues that health professionals -- and the rest of us -- need to change how we approach patients' final days. ""You don't have to spend much time with the elderly or those with terminal illness to see how often medicine fails the people it is supposed to help,"" he writes. ""The waning days of our lives are given over to treatments that addle our brains and sap our bodies for a sliver's chance of benefit."" Instead, Gawande proposes embracing death as normal. It ""may be the enemy,"" he writes, ""but it is also the natural order of things."" It's not an entirely new concept in modern medicine. Since the 1990s, the rise of hospice care and similar services has served as a stark acknowledgment that sometimes, quality of life in one's final days is more important than last-ditch efforts to fight the inevitable. But it's an idea that's rapidly becoming more pertinent. In 2050, roughly 83.7 million Americans will be over 65 -- nearly twice the number from 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ""The projected growth of the older population in the United States will present challenges to policy makers and programs, such as Social Security and Medicare,"" said a May Census report (PDF) on the aging population. ""It will also affect families, businesses, and health care providers."" The National Institute on Aging, part of the government's National Institutes of Health, also emphasizes the importance of non-curative care in a loved one's final days. ""When a doctor says something like, 'I'm afraid the news is not good. There are no other treatments for us to try. I'm sorry,' it may close the door to the possibility of a cure, but it does not end the need for medical support,"" says an NIA guide on end-of-life care. ""Nor does it end the involvement of family and friends. There are many places and a variety of ways to provide care for an older person who is dying. Such care often involves a team."" In his book, Gawande recalls a cancer patient who, for months, underwent one painful, potentially fatal treatment after another, when doctors knew they'd almost certainly only cause him more discomfort while prolonging an illness that would never be cured. We need to do better, he says. ""Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people,"" he writes, ""and denied them the basic comforts they most need.""","Surgeon wants us to think again about care for the dying .
He says the medical profession isn't trained to embrace the inevitable .
By 2050, 83 million Americans will be older than 65 ."
"Sixty-three women and girls kidnapped by Boko Haram last month in Nigeria escaped from their captors and have returned to their burnt village, a security source and a local vigilante fighting the militant group said. The hostages were seized from the Kummabza village in northern Borno state on June 18 after a four-day invasion of the village by Boko Haram insurgents. The militants killed 30 men and burned the entire village. Their escape is good news, but the Islamist terrorist group is still believed to be holding about 200 schoolgirls abducted April 14 from their hostels in the town of Chibok -- a case that drew international outrage and prompted a global campaign for their release. Boko Haram has been active as a violent group since 2009 and has killed Nigerians, both Christian and Muslim, at rates frequently exceeding 100 people weekly. The name ""Boko Haram"" translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa. The group especially opposes the education of women. Under its version of Sharia law, women should be at home raising children and looking after their husbands, not at school learning to read and write. 'Rare opportunity to escape' The female hostages escaped Friday while their captors left their camp to launch an attack against the military and police in the nearby town of Damboa, said Bukar Kyari, a local vigilante fighting Boko Haram in Maiduguri. Soldiers overwhelmed the insurgents, forcing them to mobilize all their men and leave the abducted women in the camp, Kyari said. ""The women seized that rare opportunity to escape when they realized they were alone in the camp,"" Kyari said. ""But we still have five women, including a nursing mother, missing."" News of the escape was slow to emerge due to trouble with telecommunication towers in the area damaged by previous Boko Haram attacks. Boko Haram has recently intensified abductions of women in northeastern Borno state, where its five-year insurgency is largely concentrated. When a group of women and girls abducted in November was later rescued from Boko Haram, some were pregnant. Others had been forcibly converted to Islam and married off to their kidnappers. #BringBackOurGirls . The April kidnapping galvanized international opinion against Boko Haram and inspired the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. The terror group abducted an estimated 276 girls April 14 from a boarding school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 girls are still missing. Since then the insurgents, seemingly galvanized by the attention, have stepped up the frequency and brazenness of the attacks on villages in the region. Other girls have been kidnapped, but in lesser numbers. The Nigerian government has come under fire for not doing enough to find the girls. About a month ago the government tried to stop organized protests for the abducted girls, then backtracked and allowed the protests. Deadly battles rage on . Meanwhile, the group continues battling Nigeria's military. Its ambitions have apparently expanded to the destruction of the Nigerian government. On Friday, at least six soldiers, five police officers and 53 Boko Haram fighters were killed after the militants launched an attack in the town of Bama, the Nigerian Defense Ministry said. Local residents said half the town was burnt, including the police station. Many of Boko Haram's attacks take place in the northern part of the country, despite the fact that Nigeria's northern half is mainly Muslim and the south is mainly Christian. But the radical militant group does not consider all Muslims as supporters and allies. Boko Haram has allegedly killed Muslim clerics who have dared to criticize the group. And there have been suggestions that it attacks certain mosques because members have spoken out against it and helped federal officials with their crackdown. Analysts say attacks are aimed at instilling fear in the local population to prevent cooperation with the government. Mohammed Yusuf, a charismatic young cleric, founded Boko Haram 12 years ago as part of his push for a pure Islamic state in Nigeria. He was killed in 2009, but his group lived on. Boko Haram became more violent after his death as his supporters vowed to strike back. Human Rights Watch estimates that in the past five years, more than 3,000 people have been killed in the violence.

"Two car bombs killed at least 31 people, including 20 children, in central Yemen's Radaa city when suspected al Qaeda fighters targeted Houthi militants Tuesday, senior security officials and locals told CNN. One car bomb struck a Houthi gathering point, but the other did not make it to the target and instead blew up next to a bus that was carrying children home from school, officials said. All the killed children were under the age of 12, said Osama Sari, a prominent pro-Houthi activist. Eleven Houthi fighters were killed, an Interior Ministry official said. Eyewitnesses told CNN that the death toll within Houthi lines exceeded 18. At least a dozen others were injured, among them six in critical condition, medical sources in Radaa told CNN. Radaa was an al Qaeda stronghold that fell to Houthi fighters after clashes in October that killed hundreds from both sides. Al Qaeda has since intensified its attacks on Houthi targets, conducting daily attacks killing hundreds of Houthis and innocent civilians. Houthis follow the Zaidi sect of Islam and are considered Shiite Muslims by al Qaeda, a Sunni Muslim terrorist network. Sari said that most of the killed were children and that the attack holds the hallmarks of al Qaeda. ""The suicide car bombs were supposed to directly hit the Houthi camp. When they failed to reach the core target, many innocent children lost their lives,"" Sari said.","One car bomb hit Houthi militants; another exploded next to a school bus, officials say .

"(CNN)The Obama administration has consistently supported measures aimed at reforming mandatory minimum prison sentencing for nonviolent drug offenders. But President Barack Obama's recent decision to commute the prison sentences of only eight federal inmates -- incarcerated for drug crimes -- has left advocates wanting more. The forgiveness of a crime after a sentence is served or the reduction of a sentence currently being served is one of the few presidential powers widely unchecked by Congress or the courts. Commutations are traditionally issued in the weeks leading up to the holidays. The eight offenders granted commutations this year (here is the full list from the White House) were all serving lengthy sentences, half of them life sentences, for drug offenses related to crack cocaine and methamphetamine. Although this was the same number of commutations granted in 2013, many expected the number to be much greater given the Justice Department's April announcement of a new prison reform initiative aimed at making it easier for the administration to pardon or reduce sentences of non-violent offenders. ""Well, it's a start, albeit a disappointingly small one,"" said Julie Stewart of Families Against Mandatory Minimums. ""Given the administration's pronouncement that it wants to grant more clemencies, I was surprised they granted the exact same number of commutations as last December."" The initiative launched by the Obama administration and outside advocacy groups earlier this year was touted as a way to ""quickly and effectively identify"" inmates serving mandatory minimum sentences that have since been characterized as ""out-of-date"" and inappropriate, according to a statement made by Deputy Attorney General James Cole in May. Cole said the President's decision to grant clemency to these eight individuals ""sustains his commitment to bring fairness to our criminal justice system. While all eight were properly held accountable for their criminal actions, their punishments did not fit their crimes, and sentencing laws and policies have since been updated to ensure more fairness for low-level offenders."" But the Clemency Report, an advocacy group dedicated to making executive clemency work on the federal level, called the number of commutes ""disgraceful in an era of mass imprisonment,"" according to a statement posted to their website. The advocacy group pointed out that no marijuana, powder cocaine or LSD offenders had their sentences shortened despite the fact that an estimated 2,000 federal inmates qualify for commutation consideration under the administration's new criteria. This new policy dictates offenders must be low-level, nonviolent and without a significant criminal history. They also must have served at least 10 years of their sentence and have demonstrated good conduct in prison, with no history of violence before or during their incarceration. One federal inmate who clearly meets the Justice Department criteria for commutation is Timothy Tyler, sentenced to two life sentences without the possibility of parole for conspiracy to possess LSD with the intent to distribute. He has spent more than 20 years in prison but has been clinging to the hope he will someday be free as a result of the Justice Department's initiative and the absence of a violent past. Timothy's sister, Carrie, who has dedicated her life to tirelessly efforting her brother's release, believes that the lack of commutations this year does not indicate a reluctance on Obama's part to follow through with prison reforms. But it is evidence of the bureaucracy-induced backlog caused by the amount of applications for qualified inmates, she believes. RELATED: Man hopes new sentencing rules will get him out . Obama has received 15,646 petitions for commutation since 2009 and, with the addition of the eight granted this year, has granted a total of 21. That's more than the number granted by Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan at the same stage in their presidencies. ""One of [the pardoned prisoners] is Tim's friend and he put his petition in two years ago,"" Carrie Tyler said. ""Tim's petition has not been submitted. It will be in the beginning of the year. It has taken them over a year to do his petition."" She is still hopeful her brother's name will be on the list of those released some day in the near future. ""I believe more will come in the future. I think he [the President] will keep his promise,"" Carrie Tyler. Stewart, of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, which has been working on Timothy Tyler's release, also remains optimistic. ""I think the new pardon attorney, Deborah Leff, is genuinely interested in finding deserving candidates,"" she said of the new head of the Office of the Pardon Attorney, long been seen as the ""Office of No.""","President Barack Obama recently commuted the sentences of eight federal drug offenders .
The Obama administration has consistently supported mandatory minimum sentence reforms .
Advocates say they are disappointed with the low number of commutations by Obama ."
"Surabaya, Indonesia  (CNN)AirAsia Indonesia did not have a license to fly the Surabaya-to-Singapore route on Sunday that ended in tragedy, it has been revealed. The airline was approved to fly the route four days a week but it did not include Sunday. Indonesia's Ministry of Transport has announced a full investigation and suspended Indonesia AirAsia flights between the two cities. It will also check all other airlines operating in the country to make sure they were complying with license agreements. AirAsia search turns up big parts in Java Sea . Indonesia AirAsia CEO Sunu Widyatmoko was quoted on local television as saying the airline would cooperate fully with the investigation and would not be releasing any statement until the results were known. He has not returned calls from CNN. AirAsia Indonesia is a subsidiary of the Malaysian-based AirAsia group. The parent company owns almost 49% of the Indonesian operation. The investigation will focus on the operations of AirAsia Indonesia and state-owned airport operator Angkasa Pura 1, which manages Surabaya airport. Transport Minister Ignatious Jonan described the airline's breach as a ""serious violation."" ""How could they fly? Who would they have to approach to be able to make that flight. It would have to be the airport management or lobby air traffic control."" He said the investigation is expected to take about a week. ""It's not complicated. There is a checklist of what should and should not have been done."" He said penalties ranged from AirAsia losing the right to fly the Surabaya-Singapore route through to grounding the entire operation, ""depending on the evidence from the investigation."" Flight QZ8501 took off from Juanda International Airport in Surabaya a little after 5:30 a.m. last Sunday. Just after 6:12 a.m., one of the pilots radioed air traffic control requesting permission to climb from 32,000 to 38,000 feet and turn left to avoid bad weather. Permission was given to turn but not to increase altitude. That was the last communication with the plane. At 6:18 a.m. it disappeared from radar. In an statement earlier, the transport ministry said the airline ""has violated the agreement on route given."" ""Indonesia AirAsia route Surabaya-Singapore was operated outside of the permitted license, namely among others on Sunday. And Indonesia AirAsia did not submit a request to alter operational day to the Directorate General of Air Transport. This is a violation against the agreement in the route provided,"" the statement said. Aviation expert Geoff  Thomas, an author on aviation issues and editor of  airlineratings.com, which writes on airline safety worldwide,  said it was ""highly unusual"" to fly without approval. Captain's family remembers him . ""If it was not authorized it could realize legal and insurance implications,"" he said. ""In most jurisdictions, it is highly unusual. An airline will have to apply for a new flight."" Thomas added that in countries with an open-skies policy, airlines could add or subtract flights as they saw fit if there was the capacity at the airports, but Indonesia does not operate an open-skies policy. AirAsia was founded by Tony Fernandes, currently the CEO, in 2001. It has had a spotless safety record until now. Airline safety in Indonesia, one of Asia's fastest growing aviation markets, has improved in recent years. The last fatal accident involving a commercial jetliner was in 2007, according to the analysis group Flightglobal. Jonan said he had been in touch with Fernandes via email and that the he had accepted the suspension of the airline.

"As another American patient with Ebola arrives in the United States, here is a look at the American patients who have been diagnosed with this deadly virus. Ashoka Mukpo arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center on Monday, where he will be treated in the same biocontainment unit that helped Dr. Rick Sacra. Three other Americans, Dr. Kent Brantly, Nancy Writebol and an unnamed patient, have been treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. The sixth known American patient was a man named Patrick Sawyer who died in Nigeria. Name: Patrick Sawyer . Age: 40 . Organization: Sawyer was a top official in the Liberian Ministry of Finance. Where he was infected: Sawyer was caring for his Ebola-stricken sister in Liberia before he flew to Lagos, Nigeria. He collapsed getting off the plane July 20 and was isolated at a local hospital. Current status: Five days after he arrived at the hospital, Sawyer became the first American -- and so far the only American -- to die in the current Ebola outbreak. Name: Dr. Kent Brantly . Age: 33 . Organization: Samaritan's Purse, a nondenominational evangelical Christian international relief organization based in North Carolina. Where he was infected: Brantly went to Liberia with his wife and two children last year to serve a two-year fellowship. He was there initially to practice general medicine, but when the Ebola outbreak began, he took on the role of medical director for the Samaritan's Purse Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia, the capital city of Liberia. The CDC believes he contracted the virus from another health care worker at the hospital. Where he was treated: Brantly was flown to Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Georgia on August 2 and was taken by ambulance to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Treatment given: Brantly received one of the first doses of ZMapp, an experimental drug that had never been tested in humans. ZMapp was developed by the biotech firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc., which is based in San Diego. Current status: Brantly was released from Emory on August 21, free of the virus. Name: Nancy Writebol . Age: 59 . Organization: Serving in Mission, also known as SIM, an international mission organization. Where she was infected: Writebol and her husband, David, arrived in Monrovia in August 2013. Writebol guided missionaries and worked with nurses at ELWA hospital, where her husband was the technical services manager. Where she was treated: Writebol was flown to Atlanta shortly after Brantly and was treated at Emory University Hospital. Treatment given: Writebol also received the experimental drug ZMapp before leaving Liberia. She and Brantly also received what's called supportive therapy at Emory, which means supporting the patient's immune system as it tries to battle the infection. This usually involves intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration and shock, blood or platelet transfusions and oxygen therapy. Current status: Writebol was released from Emory on August 19. Name: Dr. Rick Sacra . Age: 52 . Organization: Serving in Mission . Where he was infected: Sacra had been to Liberia with SIM before and volunteered to go again after he heard that fellow missionaries Writebol and Brantly had contracted the virus, SIM USA President Bruce Johnson said. Sacra was delivering babies at a general hospital in Monrovia when he contracted the virus. Where he was treated: Sacra was flown to the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha on September 5. The center houses one of just a few biocontainment units in the United States. Treatment given: Sacra was treated with aggressive supportive care, including electrolytes and IV fluids. He was also given a blood transfusion with plasma donated by Brantly, which doctors believe had antibodies that Sacra needed to help his immune system fight the Ebola virus. Sacra also received an experimental drug called TKM-Ebola, which the FDA recently approved for wider use. Current status: Sacra was released from the Nebraska Medical Center on September 25. Though he is free of the virus, his immune system was significantly weakened by the fight. He landed in a Massachusetts hospital with an upper respiratory infection over the weekend and was released Sunday. Name: Unknown . Age: Unknown . Organization: The World Health Organization has said a doctor working for the agency tested positive for Ebola on September 8. Where he was infected: Sierra Leone . Where he is being treated: The man arrived at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on September 9. Current status: ""We are still treating the patient with Ebola virus disease at Emory University Hospital, but we do not have a condition update,"" Emory representatives told CNN Monday. The HIPAA Privacy Rule prevents them from sharing any patient information without his permission. Name: Ashoka Mukpo . Age: 33 . Organization: Freelance camera operator for NBC News . Where he was infected: Mukpo had been to Liberia before and had been in Monrovia for about two weeks before he started presenting with Ebola symptoms on October 1. In addition to working for NBC, he has worked for other international media, including Al Jazeera and Vice News. Where he is being treated: Mukpo was flown to the United States on October 6 and isolated at the Nebraska Medical Center. Current status: On Sunday, Mukpo's father, Dr. Mitchell Levy, told NBC News that Mukpo was feeling ""not that ill."" He was able to walk onto the plane with assistance.","Ashoka Mukpo arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center on Monday .

"Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro called Friday on the United States to exchange ambassadors just days after expelling three American diplomats from the country. The request came during an hours-long news conference aired on state-run TV, where Maduro called on President Barack Obama to begin talks, even as he repeatedly accused the United States of interfering in Venezuelan internal affairs and stoking sometimes violent anti-government protests in recent days. ""I call for a dialogue with you, Obama,"" Maduro said. ""You can designate (U.S. Secretary of State John) Kerry or whoever you want to come to this dialogue and I will send my foreign minister ... for this high-level meeting."" At the same time, Maduro accused Obama of failing to live up to a commitment not to ""interfere with Venezuelan affairs."" ""What you have said has not been carried out,"" he said. The United States and Venezuela have not had resident ambassadors since 2010, although they have maintained diplomatic missions and active embassies. Maduro's call to exchange ambassadors comes after his government accused American diplomats of using a visa program as cover to meet with with youth organizers at private universities ""for training, financing and creating youth organizations through which violence is promoted in Venezuela."" The expulsion, which President Nicolas Maduro first announced Sunday, comes after the State Department expressed concerns about rising tensions in Venezuela. Maduro's news conference comes amid questions of whether he can hold onto control of the country amid rising demonstrations. Venezuela's western state of Tachira became a flashpoint Friday between anti-government protesters and security forces. Protesters blocked off some of the main roads in the capital, San Cristobal, public transportation was paralyzed, and few businesses were open. Maduro's government has responded strongly to protests in Tachira as he faces the largest demonstrations since coming to power almost a year ago. The country's interior minister, Miguel Rodriguez Torres, has announced a new plan to restore order in Tachira, which, he said, may include sending a battalion of paratroopers there. ""This battalion will reinforce the units that find themselves on the major roadways that converge in this city,"" Rodriguez said Thursday. The military is necessary because the government believes that people from across the border in Colombia are crossing into Tachira to make trouble, Rodriguez said. Meanwhile, the government on Friday said that eight people have died in the violence related to the protests and clashes. Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz said another 137 have been injured. Four people were killed in Caracas, two in Carabobo state, one in Sucre state and one in Lara state, he said. The government and the opposition blame each other for the deaths. Maduro singled out one opposition leader, Leopoldo Lopez, as responsible for calling for the protests. Lopez turned himself in to authorities this week, and he was charged Thursday with arson and conspiracy. More serious charges of murder and terrorism were dropped. If convicted, Lopez could face up to 10 years in prison. The unrest . During the demonstrations, supporters of the country's socialist government and anti-government protesters have flooded social media with reports of violence, making drastically different claims about who's behind it. Since February 13, more than 2,000 stories from Venezuela have been uploaded to iReport, CNN's user-generated platform. Many of the videos and photos depict violent scenes between demonstrators and government forces. He also called out called out CNN, Fox and other U.S.-based media, claiming that they are encouraging opposition forces against the government . Alejandro Camacho Beomont told iReport that students Wednesday blocked streets and burned debris in San Cristobal, from where he sent photos -- and he said he didn't blame them. ""Even though I am always looking for peace to make a better place to live, I think people have the right to express themselves in the ways they can, and it is not easy to express yourself in this country now,"" he said. ""I support the protesters. There have been more than 15 years that the majority of the Venezuelan citizens are going through tough times. There are so many problems we have to face every day, and there seems to be not a sincere attitude from the high government officials to rectify (them)."" In a nationally televised broadcast Wednesday night, Maduro described bullet wounds sustained by government forces during protests and showed videos that he said depicted opposition protesters throwing stones and setting buses ablaze. ""You think this is a novel? This is the reality that you with your hatred have created,"" he said. ""If you don't like Venezuela, leave.""","Nicolas Maduro calls for talks with the United States .

"CNN's Don Lemon speaks exclusively with friends and family members about Michael Jackson's last days in ""Michael Jackson: His Final Days,"" 8 p.m. ET Friday on CNN. (InStyle.com)  -- One year after his untimely death, it's clear that Michael Jackson's legacy lives on. His influence over the worlds of music and fashion is still strong enough that Lady Gaga -- currently the reigning queen of the charts and an undisputed master in the Jackson-pioneered art of manufacturing buzz -- recently hoisted her own star even higher by announcing that she'd been asked to open for (and duet with) the King of Pop on his ill-fated ""This Is It"" tour. It's not surprising that she'd boast: Like virtually every other singer of her generation, Gaga owes an enormous creative debt to Jackson. And it goes way beyond the innovative role he played as a trailblazer of the music video (although Gaga's latest mega-efforts in that field certainly do credit to the form.) InStyle: Lady Gaga's most gaga outfits . Jackson was dressing in over-the-top metallic ensembles back when Gaga was still in diapers, and though the elaborate masked outfits she's worn everywhere from the MTV VMAs to her little sister's high school graduation may have a high-fashion precedent, they also call to mind the period when a paparazzi-weary Jackson began parading around Bahrain in a burka. Rihanna, too, has lately taken a few pages out of Jackson's book. Last week, an exec at her label announced that ""our bar for [her next] album is Michael Jackson's 'Thriller,'"" meaning they're hoping that every song on it is a hit. InStyle: Rihanna's best looks ever . She sampled his ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" for her song ""Don't Stop the Music,"" and she's been seen in a number of Jackson-esque garments, most recently a pair of shining ankle socks that strongly evoked his signature sequined pair. InStyle: Stars channel Michael Jackson's iconic style . But one would be hard-pressed to find a pop star who hasn't been influenced by Jackson's inimitable style: Usher dances in natty black and white and a very MJ hat in the video for his current smash, ""OMG."" Justin Timberlake, too, has borrowed Jackson's sense of showmanship -- and, at times, his fedora. InStyle: Stars pay tribute to Michael Jackson . The rhinestone-laden jean shorts that Katy Perry donned for her new ""California Gurls"" clip call Jackson to mind -- he loved to add improbable amounts of glitz to quotidian items, like jackets, shirts, and (again) socks. And the shining metallic ornament Beyonce wore on her left hand throughout the ""Single Ladies"" era seemed inspired, in part, by Jackson's single glove. Even eleven-year-old actor Jaden Smith -- who was born well after the King of Pop's heyday (and is himself the spawn of another musician, former Fresh Prince Will Smith) -- recently pledged allegiance to Jackson's style: At the June 10th premiere of his film ""The Karate Kid,"" he walked the red carpet in black pants, a crisp white shirt and a carbon copy of Jackson's red-and-black leather ""Thriller"" jacket.

"A respiratory virus is sending hundreds of children to hospitals throughout the Midwest and beyond, health officials say. The unusually high number of hospitalizations reported could be ""just the tip of the iceberg in terms of severe cases,"" said Mark Pallansch, a virologist and director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Viral Diseases. Twelve states have contacted the CDC for assistance in investigating clusters of enterovirus: Alabama, Colorado, Michigan, Georgia, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Utah. Four -- Colorado, Illinois, Missouri and Iowa -- have confirmed cases of Enterovirus D68, also known as EV-D68. What is Enterovirus EV-D68? At a news briefing Monday, the CDC confirmed that samples it tested from children who had been hospitalized in Illinois and in Kansas City, Missouri, did show signs of the EV-D68 virus, meaning there is a possible regional outbreak. The Iowa Department of Public Health confirmed that EV-D68 cases have been identified in Iowa. Officials are hearing of illnesses across the state, they say, though there is not a firm count of how many people have been infected. Dr. Christine Nyquist, medical director of infection control at Children's Hospital Colorado, said the hospital sent around 25 samples to the CDC from patients with respiratory illness. Around 75% were confirmed to be EV-D68. The hospital has seen a 12% to 15% increase in emergency room visits and admissions this month compared with the same time frame last year, she said. Enteroviruses, which bring on symptoms like a very intense cold, aren't unusual. ""It's important to remember that these infections are very common,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat. Schuchat is the assistant surgeon general for the U.S. Public Health Service and the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. When you have a bad summer cold, often what you have is an enterovirus. The CDC estimates there are 10 to 15 million viral infections each year in the United States. The season often hits its peak in September. This particular type of enterovirus -- EV-D68 -- is uncommon but not new. It was identified in the 1960s, and there have been fewer than 100 reported cases since that time. But it's possible that the relatively low number of reports might be because EV-D68 is hard to identify. ""It's one that we don't know as much about as we would like,"" Schuchat said. EV-D68 was seen last year in the United States and this year in various parts of the world. Over the years, clusters have been reported in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona and various countries including the Philippines, Japan and the Netherlands. The reason health officials are concerned this year is that there have been so many hospitalizations. ""That's the scary part -- the unpredictability, I think,"" Nyquist said. What parents should know about EV-D68 . Missouri . The virus has sent more than 30 children a day to a Kansas City, Missouri, hospital, where about 15% of the youngsters were placed in intensive care, officials said. In Kansas City, about 475 children were recently treated at Children's Mercy Hospital, and at least 60 of them received intensive hospitalization, spokesman Jake Jacobson said. ""It's worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care. I would call it unprecedented. I've practiced for 30 years in pediatrics, and I've never seen anything quite like this,"" said Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, the hospital's division director for infectious diseases. ""We've had to mobilize other providers, doctors, nurses. It's big,"" she said. The Kansas City hospital treats 90% of that area's ill children. Staff members noticed an initial spike on August 15, Jackson said. ""It could have taken off right after school started. Our students start back around August 17, and I think it blew up at that point,"" Jackson said. ""Our peak appears to be between the 21st and the 30th of August. We've seen some leveling of cases at this point."" An analysis by the CDC showed at least 30 of the Kansas City children tested positive for EV-D68, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Vaccines for EV-D68 aren't currently available, and there is no specific treatment for infections, the Missouri agency said. ""Many infections will be mild and self-limited, requiring only symptomatic treatment,"" it said. ""Some people with several respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 may need to be hospitalized and receive intensive supportive therapy."" Some cases of the virus might contribute to death, but none of the Missouri cases resulted in death, and no data are available for overall morbidity and mortality from the virus in the United States, the agency said. ""It's not usually fatal, thank God for that,"" Schuchat said. ""But I'm not sure why it's infecting so many kids as opposed to so many people."" Symptoms include coughing, difficulty breathing and rash. Sometimes they can be accompanied by fever or wheezing. The majority of the children who have been hospitalized with the virus, at least on the samples the CDC tested, did have asthma to start with.  The virus made their symptoms worse. ""We want parents to know that it's important to make sure your children with asthma are on their medicines and keeping up with their medication routine,"" Schuchat said. Jackson said physicians in other Midwest states reported cases with similar symptoms. ""The full scope is yet to be known, but it would appear it's in the Midwest.  In our community, meticulous hand-washing is not happening. It's just the nature of kids,"" Jackson said. Colorado . Denver also is seeing a spike in respiratory illnesses resembling the virus, CNN affiliate KUSA said. More than 900 children have gone to Children's Hospital Colorado emergency and urgent care locations since August 18 for treatment of severe respiratory illnesses, including enterovirus and viral infections, hospital spokeswoman Melissa Vizcarra said. Of those, 86 have been sick enough to be admitted to the Aurora facility. And Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children had five children in intensive care and 20 more in the pediatric unit, KUSA said last week. ""This is the worst I've seen in my time here at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children,"" Dr. Raju Meyeppan told the outlet. ""We're going to have a pretty busy winter at this institution and throughout the hospitals of Denver."" Will Cornejo, 13, was among the children in intensive care at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children after he came down with a cold last weekend and then woke up Tuesday night with an asthma attack that couldn't be controlled with his medicine albuterol. His mother, Jennifer, called 911 when her son's breathing became shallow, and her son was airlifted to the Denver hospital, she told KUSA. Her son was put on a breathing tube for 24 hours. ""It was like nothing we've ever seen,"" Jennifer Cornejo told KUSA. ""He was unresponsive. He was laying on the couch. He couldn't speak to me. He was turning white, and his lips turned blue. ""We're having a hard time believing that it really happened,"" she added. ""We're much better now because he is breathing on his own. We're on the mend."" Risk of infection . In East Columbus, Ohio, Nationwide Children's Hospital saw a 20% increase in patients with respiratory illnesses last weekend, and Dr. Dennis Cunningham said patient samples are being tested to determine whether EV-D68 is behind the spike, CNN affiliate WTTE rep . Blessing Hospital in Quincy, Illinois, saw more than 70 children with respiratory issues last weekend, and seven of them were admitted, CNN affiliate WGEM reported. The hospital's Dr. Robert Merrick believes that the same virus that hit Kansas City is causing the rash of illnesses seen at the Quincy and Hannibal hospitals, which both imposed restrictions this week on children visiting patients, the affiliate said. ""Mostly we're concerned about them bringing it in to a vulnerable patient. We don't feel that the hospital is more dangerous to any other person at this time,"" Merrick told WGEM. Like other enteroviruses, EV-D68 appears to spread through close contact with infected people, the agency said. ""Unlike the majority of enteroviruses that cause a clinical disease manifesting as a mild upper respiratory illness, febrile rash illness, or neurologic illness (such as aseptic meningitis and encephalitis), EV-D68 has been associated almost exclusively with respiratory disease,"" the Missouri health agency said. Clusters of the virus have struck Asia, Europe and the United States from 2008 to 2010, and the infection caused relatively mild to severe illness, with some intensive care and mechanical ventilation, the health agency said. To reduce the risk of infection, individuals should wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after changing diapers; avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; avoid kissing, hugging and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick; disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as toys and doorknobs; and stay home when feeling sick, the Missouri agency said.

"An Alabama public high school declined to enroll a 17-year-old Latino student twice ""simply because he was born in Mexico,"" the Southern Poverty Law Center said Tuesday. The teen, identified only as ""J.T."" by the SPLC, endured discrimination when he attempted to enroll at Fort Payne High School in January after moving to Alabama from Colorado, the civil rights group said. J.T. immigrated to the United States from Mexico when he was 1, according to SPLC staff attorney Caren Short. The student's family met with the district superintendent and ""brought a completed enrollment application, proof of residency in the school district, an immunization record and a Social Security card,"" but J.T. was still denied enrollment, the SPLC said. ""The principal did not even look at the documents. After J.T. said he had to make up two failed classes from the previous year, the principal said he couldn't enroll him,"" the SPLC said. Fort Payne City Schools Superintendent Jim Cunningham said the law forbids him giving information that could identify a student, as well a publicly responding about the ""enrollment concern that has been presented to me."" ""However, I can unequivocally confirm that the Fort Payne City School System in no manner utilizes or considers an individual's national origin in its enrollment decisions. Indeed, even a cursory review of the system's current student population, confirms the enrollment of a diverse student body,"" he said in a prepared statement. He further said, ""The representative for the individual at issue has been specifically advised that he is more than welcome to immediately enroll into the system subject to the same enrollment criteria applicable to any individual such as himself that is over the age of mandatory school attendance.  The individual has been requested to meet with the system this week in order to facilitate the enrollment request."" Michael Sibley, a spokesman for the Alabama Department of Education, told CNN, ""We certainly tolerate no type of discrimination and need to look into it."" In a letter to Cunningham, the SPLC wrote that the ""practices violate federal law that bars discrimination based on national origin, immigration status or limited English proficiency."" The school told the family it was not obligated to enroll J.T. because he is 17, according a statement by the SPLC. ""It makes me feel like I dropped out,"" J.T. said in a statement. ""It's like I have nothing to accomplish. I just feel worthless."" Alabama state law requires children between the ages of 6 and 17 to attend school, but ""it does not grant the right to deny a child enrollment simply because he or she is 17,"" the letter said. ""This excuse has no basis in district or state education policy,"" the letter said. ""It even violates the nondiscrimination policies of the Alabama Department of Education and the district."" The SPLC, a nonprofit civil rights organization based in Alabama, has instructed the district to enroll the student by April 14. Asked if there were other documented cases of this occurring, Short said the SPLC has heard similar reports out of Fort Payne but emphasized that the group was representing only one teen. She further said that while the SPLC doesn't have any national figures available, the U.S. justice and education departments issued a letter to school districts in May 2011 to ensure that no child was denied the opportunity to enroll in school or discouraged from enrolling based on origin or immigrations status. The guidance ""was issued when many states were passing anti-immigrant legislation, including Alabama's (House Bill 56), which required schools to record the immigration status of children enrolling in school,"" Short said in an e-mail. ""Of course, that provision of the law has been stopped by a federal court. But there remains concern that schools are potentially excluding children based on their national origin, immigration status, or limited English proficiency.""

There's Tsarnaev the bloodied fugitive, captured by police with rifle lasers tagging his head as he surrendered from a tarp-covered boat in a homeowner's backyard. That ended a massive manhunt for suspects four days after a pair of crude pressure-cooker bombs killed three people and injured 264 more. Prosecutors say the ideology of Islamic extremists motivated him and that he knew what he was doing when he planted a bomb at the marathon's crowded finish line in April 2013. Then there's Tsarnaev smiling from the cover of Rolling Stone, a young man who prosecutors say fell under the sway of a manipulative older brother bent on jihad. Defense attorneys have suggested Tsarnaev was controlled by that brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a confrontation with police three days after the bombing. The younger drove over the older brother and escaped. Defense attorneys also have said the family's history played a role in shaping Tsarnaev. They note that the family, of Chechen ethnicity, experienced difficulties dating to World War II, when Josef Stalin deported mass populations to central Asia. The death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev leaves Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 21, to stand trial alone. Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday in a trial that could last months. He has pleaded not guilty to more than 30 federal charges, including using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death. ""Prosecutors appear to have virtually incontrovertible evidence supporting their claim that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, planned and executed the Boston Marathon bombing,"" said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan, a former prosecutor and defense attorney. ""The defense, on the other hand, will push for a more expansive 'War and Peace' type presentation to create a narrative that paints Dzhokhar as the innocent pawn of a domineering older brother,"" Callan added. ""A more expansive presentation of Dzhokhar's family and psychological history is more likely to be seen during the sentencing phase if the jury returns a guilty verdict."" Read the indictment . High-profile public defender . Heightening the stakes is how the trial is a capital case, meaning that if a federal jury finds Tsarnaev guilty in the terror attack, he will face a separate proceeding on whether he should be executed. Seventeen of the charges carry the death penalty or a maximum of life in prison. ""There will be a guilt phase of this case, you know, whether the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that Tsarnaev was the bomber,"" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. If Tsarnaev is found guilty, ""then there will be a small, separate mini-trial"" on whether he should receive the death penalty, Toobin added. If so, Tsarnaev will benefit from one of the most prominent attorneys in high-profile capital cases. She's federal public defender Judy Clarke, whom Toobin described as ""a legendary death penalty defense lawyer."" Clarke fought for the lives of several notorious criminals, including ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski and Arizona rampage gunman Jared Lee Loughner, who seriously wounded former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Both received a life sentence with no chance for parole in exchange for guilty pleas. Learn more about Judy Clarke . The Boston Marathon bombings were extensively photographed and videotaped. In fact, Tsarnaev's legal team sought to relocate the trial outside Boston, but the court ruled no. As it turns out, holding the trial in Massachusetts' capital city could carry an advantage for Tsarnaev if he faces a death penalty. Boston is a politically liberal city with strong opposition to the death penalty, analysts say. Prosecution: A 'mass destruction' bomber . In contrast to portrayals of Tsarnaev as a manipulated youngster from a troubled family, prosecutors cast him as a deliberate killer inspired by jihadi literature who inflicted terror at the Boston Marathon. Tsarnaev ""knowingly conspired with Tamerlan Tsarnaev to use a weapon of mass destruction"" and ""knowingly and unlawfully delivered, placed, discharged and detonated an explosive"" in public place, the indictment alleges. At the time of the attacks, Tsarnaev was a student at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. His dorm room contained evidence on his computer and a backpack of fireworks that had been emptied of their powder, prosecutors allege. The brothers Tsarnaev began their plot at least two months before the attacks, the indictment says, when the elder sibling bought 48 mortars containing about eight pounds of explosive powder from a fireworks store in Seabrook, New Hampshire, in February 2013. The younger Tsarnaev allegedly downloaded a copy of Inspire magazine, an English-language online publication of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a terrorist organization based in Yemen. It contained detailed instructions on how to build an improvised explosive device with pressure cookers, explosive powder from fireworks, shrapnel and other materials, prosecutors charge. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly placed a backpack concealing one pressure cooker bomb in front of the Forum restaurant on Boylston Street. He then called his older brother on a cell phone. One minute after that phone call, the older brother allegedly detonated a bomb that he had planted, and, seconds later, the younger brother detonated the bomb he had planted, which killed two people, the indictment charges. After the bombing, the brothers killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer by shooting him in the head at close range, the indictment alleges. Writing on the wall . When Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hid in the stowed boat in Watertown, Massachusetts, he wrote several incriminating declarations on an inside wall and its beams, according to the indictment: . ""We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all. ""Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said (unintelligible) it is allowed. ""Stop killing innocent people and we will stop. ""The U.S. Government is killing our innocent civilians. ""I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished."" His older brother was buried in a Muslim cemetery in Doswell, Virginia, after cemeteries in Massachusetts and elsewhere refused to bury him. 'Older brother as an all-powerful force' Defense attorneys suggest in court documents that their client succumbed to his domineering older brother. The legal team doesn't declare a defense strategy, but they paint a portrait of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in a court motion in March arguing how the jury should hear evidence about relative culpability and whether the younger brother fell under the ""domination and control"" of the elder one. Potential evidence could show the older brother as someone who ""induced or coerced his younger brother to help commit"" the attacks, the defense team says in papers. The never-proved accusation that Tamerlan Tsarnaev participated in a 2011 triple murder whose victims included a close friend ""would powerfully support the inference that Dzhokhar experienced his older brother as an all-powerful force who could not be ignored or disobeyed,"" court papers say. In making that assertion, the defense attorneys requested access to FBI interview notes with a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Ibragim Todashev, who was killed by an FBI agent a month after the bombings. The agent was questioning Todashev about the older Tsarnaev. An environment of 'fear, suspicion and fear' The defense attorneys also point to how the family patriarch's emotional and mental health issues may have adversely affected both brothers. In seeking the disclosure of the family's U.S. political asylum files and other evidence, the attorneys address how ""favorable mitigation evidence bearing on a capital defendant's formative environment and mental functioning can take many forms."" That includes ""psychological domination of one family member,"" ""evidence of pervasive and longstanding distortions of reality that controlling members of a family impose upon the family unit as a whole"" and ""growing up in a close environment of pretense, suspicion and fear."" For example, Tsarnaev's father, Anzor, ""had been arbitrarily arrested and tortured in the family's home country of Kyrgyzstan"" and ""had a well-founded fear of further persecution justifying political asylum in the United States,"" the defense states in court papers. Father's 'mental and physical afflictions' on sons . Even before that, forebears of the Tsarnaev family had been deported during World War II to a remote region of central Asia by Stalin, then leader of the Soviet Union, defense court papers say. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's immediate family hailed originally from the Russian republic of Chechnya but fled warfare in the 1990s to move to neighboring Russian republics. The family then relocated to the United States. ""The profoundly destabilizing effect on Anzor's post-traumatic stress disorder and his other mental and physical afflictions on the Tsarnaev family's life in America is a critical part of the developmental histories of both of Anzor's sons,"" defense papers argued. U.S. District Judge George A. O'Toole Jr. largely disagreed, however. He rejected the defense motion to compel the discovery of the asylum documents and other materials, but said he would review the FBI files to determine ""what will be produced to the defendant.""","Prosecutors portray Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as willful conspirator of mass destruction .

"A judge in Kansas City, Missouri, has sentenced a Catholic bishop to two years on probation for failure to report suspected child abuse, officials said Thursday. Bishop Robert W. Finn, 59, is the highest-ranking Catholic official to be convicted during the church's long sexual abuse scandal. Finn won't serve any jail time or pay a fine, the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney's office said. The misdemeanor charge had a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a fine of as much as $1,000. One other misdemeanor against the bishop and two against Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph were dropped. The case stemmed from the diocese's slow dealing with Shawn Ratigan, a priest from Independence, Missouri, who pleaded guilty in August to five charges of child pornography. Missouri priest accused of taking sexually explicit photos of kids . Prosecutors said it took nearly five months for church officials to notify police that disturbing images of children had been found on Ratigan's computer. During that time Ratigan continued to work for the church. ""I truly regret and am sorry for the hurt these events have caused,"" Finn said, according to CNN affiliate KCTV. Terms of Finn's probation include starting a $10,000 fund for sexual abuse counseling and mandatory training for church officials on how to report abuse. ""We can be assured now that if an allegation of child abuse comes to the attention of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, there will be no hesitation to report it immediately to the proper authorities,"" Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said in a written statement. The case was tried by a judge instead of by jury because prosecutors wanted to protect the young victims' anonymity.

"""Look at that one -- look at how his nose is up in the air."" The big Boeing jetliner looked a bit odd to aircraft buff Fred Hayes as it neared the runway at San Francisco International Airport on Saturday. It seemed to be low, and its nose was tilted sharply upward. Then a banging sound echoed across the water, and the jet flipped nose-down and skidded in an orange-and-gray cloud. Hayes captured the scene on video while on a walk with his wife along San Francisco Bay, about a mile away. ""Oh, my God,"" Hayes said as Asiana Airlines Flight 214 tore into the tarmac and skidded across the ground. ""Oh my God. Oh, my God. Oh, Lord have mercy."" The crash-landing left two dead and hurt 182 people, six of whom were in critical condition Sunday. But 123 others walked away unhurt. Hayes and his family were on a weekend visit to San Francisco, where he had a job interview on Friday. He said he had been focusing on a taxiing United Airlines jet when the Asiana flight caught his eye. ""When I caught the plane coming into view, everything looked fine at first until I kind of fixed my gaze on him, and I seen his nose up in the air,"" Hayes said. ""And then I just totally locked on him. I thought he was going to take off and go up, and then he just kept going down."" The Boeing 777 appeared ""maybe a little lower than some of the other planes"" as it approached, ""but I couldn't say that for sure,"" he told CNN's Don Lemon. Witnesses, survivors recount crash . ""My initial thought was that with the nose pitched up in the degree that it was that the pilot was maybe trying to divert the landing,"" said Hayes, who has no background in aviation. ""As you can see in the video, it was pretty low at that point and that may or may not have been the case."" Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board told a similar story Sunday afternoon. Asiana 214 appeared to be too low and too slow as it neared the runway, and the cockpit voice recorder indicates the crew tried to abort the landing less than two seconds before the crash, NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman told reporters. Aviation expert Jim Tilmon called the video ""remarkable footage"" that will likely be analyzed by investigators ""over and over again."" Once the jet hit the ground, it skidded nose-down and sideways, spinning counterclockwise and catching fire. Tilmon, a former jetliner pilot himself, told CNN the pilot showed ""a fair amount of skill"" in keeping the jet from flipping over. ""If that had happened -- my goodness, this would be a completely different kind of report to make today,"" he said. ""Because there would sure have been a great deal more injuries as a result."" Hayes said a ""thunder-like"" sound rang across the bay when the more than 200-foot-long jetliner slammed into the ground. ""Every time a section hit, you could hear that boom and that sound,"" he said. After three or four ""really big booms,"" he said, ""It just kind of slid and came to a stop."" He and his wife watched as the emergency slides deployed and passengers began to slide down them away from the wrecked jet. He said he hoped crash investigators could learn from the video he shot. ""The only thing we can say is we're just really happy that a lot of people survived, because it wasn't looking good for them folks on that plane for sure,"" Hayes said.

"(CNN)For Frank Clegg Leatherworks, ""made in America"" is not a seasonal trend or marketing slogan meant to evoke classic workwear looks or to drive sales of limited edition brand collaborations. It's simply the way Ian and Andrew Clegg's father has done business since 1970 in Fall River, Massachusetts. It has not always been easy. Frank Clegg resisted the urge to outsource production overseas even as clients disappeared and margins shrunk. In the 1990s they started making bags for other labels to stay afloat. As the Cleggs tell it, staying in Massachusetts was the only way to ensure survival, by standing out for maintaining quality control of their products. But will consumers see it that way beyond next season? How can brands like Frank Clegg that are in it for the long haul convince the Target generation that one of their leather satchels is worth the triple-digit investment? Ian Clegg pondered this sentiment aloud to a group of people gathered in a Brooklyn showroom on a rainy Saturday night in December for a panel discussion on the future of American apparel manufacturing. His family business trains and employs skilled leather craftsmen, paying them a living wage to make quality bags and accessories, he said. ""In order to keep that going we can't let it be a trend,"" he told the group of entrepreneurs, small-business owners and fashion enthusiasts. ""How do we keep it going without it being a trend?"" The question comes at a time when shopping small and local are attractive buzzwords for a generation of consumers that claims to be disillusioned with corporate America. Whether they'll pony up the extra cash for a handbag whose makers claim will last longer than their fast-fashion equivalents is another matter â a reality that the Cleggs and other business owners in attendance seemed to be aware of. The discussion occurred during a pop-up market called Northern Grade, which features American-made goods with a contemporary feel. The first Northern Grade launched in 2010 as a menswear market in Minneapolis, expanding to other cities amid growing demand for classic looks inspired by American heritage brands. People travel hundreds of miles for the markets, which tend to attract style-conscious men (and women) willing to pay a premium for waxed cotton jackets, selvedge jeans or Oxford cloth shirts made in the United States. Northern Grade is one of several new markets trying to reach this consumer, building on the success of its predecessor, the Pop-Up Flea, which has also expanded to new cities worldwide since its first show in 2009 in New York. December's Northern Grade was the first to exclusively feature American-made products for women in an attempt to reach a demographic historically known to favor fast fashion over high-dollar investment pieces from new or emerging brands. The brands (and price tags) at Northern Grade's markets for men and women are not for everyone, said market co-founder Katherine McMillan. They're trying to reach consumers searching for quality in an item, shoppers ""who appreciate the details and bigger picture when buying an item,"" she said. ""There will always be the people who buy a shirt at H&M that's made fast and costs less than a shirt made in the U.S. by a smaller brand,"" she said. ""I'm hoping the quality shopper wins out in the long run."" The Americana boom in menswear has led to greater demand for tomboy-inspired looks for women the past few seasons. So-called ""boyfriend""-style button-up shirts and jeans are mainstays in stores like Madewell and J. Crew, and just about everyone from Valentino and Alexander Wang to Opening Ceremony has incorporated elements of  casual and formal menswear into their runway looks. Menswear's influence was apparent in many of the brands at Northern Grade, not by coincidence. Stephanie Beard, founder of Austin-based brand esby, said working in menswear inspired her to start her own line for women. ""I was really envious of how classic menswear was, but it was not cut for my body,"" she said. ""I felt like there was a market for quality womenswear because I couldn't find it when I was looking for it."" With the help of Kickstarter, she launched her first line in February with the goal of using quality fabrics, even if they can't be found in the United States. All the fabrics she uses in her collections are imported except for the knitted canvas of some shirts. The sewing and pattern-making happens in New Orleans before items are shipped to a wash house in New Jersey and back to Austin to be sold or shipped. ""Staying in the United States was always the plan,"" she said. ""I want to be hands-on and I can't fly out of the country for each season to oversee production."" For some, made in America is a lifestyle choice, said panelist Katharine Keegan, founder of style blog ""That Kind of Woman."" It has crossover appeal to those who identify as conscious consumers and claim to care about where their clothes come from. These shoppers consider the ""made in USA"" label synonymous with fair labor practices and supporting small businesses. ""Made in USA is about knowing the people behind product,"" she said. ""It's a lifestyle, it's being part of a bigger cause."" The past few years have seen the launch of a handful of e-retailers and online-first brands dedicated to supply chain transparency and knowing your brand. Information about provenance, materials and brand story are prominent features on new sites such as ZADY, Everlane, and Of a Kind. Not all brands featured on Of a Kind â which showcases limited runs of goods from emerging designers â manufacture in the United States, said Erica Cerulo. But each brand is vetted so Of a Kind can provide customers with an honest answer. ""Our customers want transparency about where things come from. That matters more to them than whether it's made in the USA,"" she said. Besides, she said, everything made in United Sates is not created equally, just like all ""made in China"" merchandise isn't the same. ""It's about finding brands you trust,"" Cerulo said. People in the audience said they would love to support these brands if they could afford them. By the end of the discussion, educating consumers had emerged as one way to sell them on the value of the goods. That's why markets like Northern Grade exist, McMillan said: so consumers can meet designers in person. ""The biggest issue, which we are always thinking about, is how much it costs,"" she said. ""I'm hoping that the way organic and local food prices have come down a little, the items we sell at Northern Grade can become more attainable to the masses. ""When you are paying for normal and fair wages for a person, the price of the item goes up. Here's hoping demand brings it down eventually.""","Small, U.S.-based clothing makers are eager to attract consumers accustomed to ""fast fashion"" but wanting more .

"(CNN) -- While protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, are demanding justice for the killing of Michael Brown by police, questions are being asked about the man who at the moment is responsible for pursuing any prosecution and whether he can be impartial. Some residents and community leaders contend St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch has deep ties to the police and has favored law enforcement in criminal cases. Missouri State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed launched a petition that now has more than 26,000 signatures to remove McCulloch from the case and replace him with a special prosecutor to handle any criminal case arising from the August 9 shooting of Brown, an African-American who was unarmed when killed by a white police officer. The shooting has touched off demonstrations that have led to confrontations with police, and some looting and violence. The National Guard was called in, President Barack Obama appealed for ""understanding"" and cooler heads, and Attorney General Eric Holder visited Ferguson on Wednesday to assess things. His agency has launched a civil rights probe. McCulloch, however, has indicated that he is going nowhere and plans to do his job. CNN has sought to interview him, but the request has not been granted. But in a radio interview with with McGraw Millhaven on KTRS, McCulloch promised a comprehensive and fair investigation. ""We will be presenting absolutely everything to this grand jury. Every statement that a witness made, every witness, every photograph, every piece of physical evidence. Absolutely nothing will be left out so the grand jury is making their decision based upon absolutely everything and we'll go from there,"" McCulloch said Wednesday. The grand jury will be given evidence as early as Wednesday, a process that could last until the middle of October, McCulloch said. Critics question McCulloch's dedication to a fair outcome and some have said he has moved too slowly. The officer ""should be charged and arrested. It's been over a week now,"" Patricia Bynes, the Democratic Party committeewoman for Ferguson Township, told CNN. We are ""motivated to have a transparent case that's accountable to the community and to make sure justice is done at every level,"" Bynes said. 5 things to know about the Brown shooting . Bynes said McCulloch's ties with police in the county could cloud his judgment. McCulloch's father was a police officer and was killed on the job in 1964 by an African-American man, when McCulloch was 12, McCulloch's spokesperson Ed Magee confirmed to CNN. In addition to his father, McCulloch's brother, an uncle and a cousin all served with the St. Louis Police Department, and his mother worked as a clerk at the department, Magee said. McCulloch, who as a teenager lost a leg to cancer, made it his career ambition to become a prosecutor. He was quoted by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch as telling a reporter, while first campaigning for the office: ""I couldn't become a policeman, so being county prosecutor is the next best thing."" McCulloch has no plans to step aside and Magee said it doesn't have any impact on how he will handle the current case. ""I have absolutely no intention of walking away from duties and the responsibilities entrusted in me by the people of this community,"" McCulloch said during the radio interview. While the Justice Department is conducting its own civil rights investigation, Ferguson elected officials are concerned about the local investigation. McCulloch has overseen controversial cases before, some including police officers and black suspects. Complete coverage of the Brown shooting . The petition being circulated points to a 2000 incident in which two suspected drug dealers were killed by two police officers, McCulloch never brought charges against the officers, concluding they acted in self-defense. A subsequent federal investigation found that the men were unarmed and not moving in the direction of the officers, but because the officers felt endangered, the investigation found that the shootings were justified, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. ""He doesn't have the fortitude to do the right thing when it comes to prosecuting police officers,"" Nasheed said on CNN's ""Newsroom"" on Tuesday. Chris King, editorial director at the St. Louis American, an African-American publication, said McCulloch has already ""manipulated"" the Brown case by the way he is releasing information. The St. Louis County Police released a convenience store video from just minutes before Brown's death that showed a person who resembled Brown stealing a box of cigars. ""All of this information should have come out all at once in group. By leaking out in pieces, he is encouraging this kind of speculation,"" King said on CNN's ""New Day."" Concerns about McCulloch arose again after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon replaced the St. Louis County Police with the Missouri State Highway Patrol for security last week because he said the initial law enforcement response to the shooting was excessive. McCulloch told CNN affiliate KMOV that the governor had ""no legal authority"" to make such a move. Why no arrest yet? Upsetting to Ferguson residents, Missouri State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal said, is that Darren Wilson, who has been identified as the officer who shot Brown, has not yet been arrested or charged. He is on paid administrative leave. It is up to the grand jury to determine what charges, if any, will be placed on Wilson. ""I am concerned because my constituents are concerned,"" Chappelle-Nadal told CNN. She said protesters carry signs or post signs in their yard demanding that McCulloch step aside. ""They say this could have been me and if they killed someone they would immediately be in jail."" But Philip Holloway, a criminal defense attorney who previously was a police officer and a prosecutor, said the fact that Wilson has not yet been charged or arrested is because he could have been acting in self-defense. Evidence must be analyzed before an arrest is made or charges are brought. ""Police officers have no more or less of a right to self-defense"" than private citizens, Holloway said. Autopsy results enough to charge officer, Brown family attorney says . Magee, the county prosecutor's spokesman, said, ""The people of St. Louis County have faith in Mr. McCulloch and his ability to carry out his duties."" McCulloch has been prosecuting attorney since 1991, and has been reelected to four-year terms ever since. He overwhelmingly won his primary on August 5, just four days before Brown's death. He had an opponent for the first time since his 1994 campaign, facing off against an African-American woman, Leslie Tolliver Broadnax. She raised just $13,450 compared to McCulloch's $361,000, according to the Missouri Ethics Commission. Friction between McCulloch and the governor . The governor addressed concerns about McCulloch. ""He's an experienced prosecutor, and this is his opportunity to step up,"" Nixon said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""It's important we get this right. This is a big matter."" Late Tuesday night, he issued a statement saying he is not asking McCulloch to recuse himself but that it is up to McCulloch to remove himself from the case. ""There is a well-established process by which a prosecutor can recuse themselves from a pending investigation, and a special prosecutor be appointed,"" Nixon said. "" Departing from this established process could unnecessarily inject legal uncertainty into this matter and potentially jeopardize the prosecution."" McCulloch slammed Nixon's statement, saying he needs to ""man up"" and decide if he wants him to stay on the case. ""It's the typical Nixon doublespeak,"" McCulloch said on KTRS. ""He says nothing and he's ducking."" Magazine: The Aftermath in Ferguson .

"The United States has asked China for help battling North Korean hacking of American information systems, such as the Sony Pictures incident, a senior administration official told CNN on Saturday. ""We have discussed this issue with the Chinese to share information, express our concerns about this attack, and to ask for their cooperation,"" the official said. ""In our cybersecurity discussions, both China and the United States have expressed the view that conducting destructive attacks in cyberspace is outside the norms of appropriate cyber behavior."" North Korea's Internet traffic goes through China. President Barack Obama said Friday, ""We've got no indication that North Korea was acting in conjunction with another country."" The New York Times first reported that the United States had approached China. On Saturday, the Guardians of Peace, a group of hackers accused of performing the cyberattack on Sony Pictures, mocked the FBI in a new statement. ""The result of investigation by FBI is so excellent that you might have seen what we were doing with your own eye,"" said the statement posted on the file-sharing website pastebin. ""We congratulate you (sic) success. FBI is the BEST in the world. You will find the gift for FBI at the following address. Enjoy!"" The link provided in the message leads to a YouTube video titled ""You Are An Idiot."" The FBI declined comment on the message. FBI says North Korea responsible . The FBI said that North Korea is responsible for the cyberattack on Sony Pictures. An FBI investigation linked the malware, infrastructure and techniques used by the Guardians of Peace in the Sony attack to previous North Korean cyberattacks. The hackers broke into Sony's servers, published private emails and information, and threatened to attack movie theaters screening ""The Interview,"" a comedy film about an assassination plot on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Earlier Saturday, North Korea slammed U.S. claims that the regime is responsible for a cyberattack on Sony Pictures -- and then proposed the two countries work together. ""Whoever is going to frame our country for a crime should present concrete evidence,"" the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported. ""America's childish investigation result and its attempt to frame us for this crime shows their hostile tendency towards us."" But in a rare move, the North Korean regime said both countries should work together. ""While America has been criticized by its own public and continues to point the finger at us, we suggest mutual investigation with America on this case,"" KCNA said. ""If America refuses our proposal of mutual investigation, continues to link us to this case, and talk about actions in response, they (America) will be met with serious consequences."" U.S. replies to North Korea . National Security Council spokesman Mark Stroh replied to the North Korean statement: . ""As the FBI made clear, we are confident the North Korean government is responsible for this destructive attack.  We stand by this conclusion.  The government of North Korea has a long history of denying responsibility for destructive and provocative actions. If the North Korean government wants to help, they can admit their culpability and compensate Sony for the damages this attack caused."" Obama said that Sony Pictures made a mistake in canceling the release of the movie. ""I am sympathetic to the concerns that they face,"" Obama said. ""Having said all that, yes, I think they made a mistake. Let's not get into that way of doing business."" North Korea rejected the notion that it would attack ""innocent moviegoers."" ""We will not tolerate the people who are willing to insult our supreme leader, but even when we retaliate, we will not conduct terror against innocent moviegoers,"" KCNA said. ""The retaliation will target the ones who are responsible and the originators of the insults. Our army has the intention and ability to do (so)."" Analyst: We underestimated North Korea . The show may go on . Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton rebuffed Obama's criticism in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, saying his company did not make a mistake. He said the decision to pull back from the planned December 25 release was based on major movie theater companies telling Sony that they would not screen the film. ""We have not caved. We have not given in,"" Lynton said. ""We have persevered, and we have not backed down. We have always had the desire to have the American public see this movie."" And despite enduring what he called ""the worst cyberattack in American history,"" Lynton said his studios would make the movie again. But in retrospect, he may have ""done some things slightly differently.""

"President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday they stand together in their efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but Netanyahu warned that time for diplomacy was running short. The two leaders met at the White House to discuss Iran's nuclear program and other Middle East issues amid talk speculation that Israel may attack nuclear sites in Iran. Speaking to the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee afterward, Netanyahu said Iranian research ""continues to march forward"" despite painful economic sanctions imposed on the Islamic republic. ""My friends, Israel has waited patiently waited for the international community to resolve this issue. We've waited for diplomacy to work,"" Netanyahu said. ""We've waited for sanctions to work,"" he said. ""None of us can afford to wait much longer. As prime minister of Israel, I will never let my people live in the shadow of annihilation."" Amanpour: What is at stake as leaders meet? Before the two leaders met at the White House, Obama told reporters that both he and Netanyahu would prefer a diplomatic solution to the Iranian issue. But Obama also repeated the warning that he delivered at AIPAC's annual conference in Washington on Sunday -- that military force remains an option to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power. ""The United States will always have Israel's back when it comes to Israel's security,"" Obama said, repeating a line from the Sunday speech as Netanyahu nodded in agreement. ""I reserve all options and my policy here is not going to be one of containment; my policy is prevention of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons and, as I indicated yesterday in my speech, when I say all options are on the table, I mean it,"" Obama added. Netanyahu said he welcomed Obama's ""strong speech"" on Sunday and noted that Iran considers the United States and Israel to be similar foes. ""For them, you're the great Satan, we're the little Satan,"" Netanyahu said. ""For them, we are you, and you are us. And you know something, Mr. President? At least on this last point, I think they're right. We are you, and you are us. We're together. ... Israel and America stand together."" Netanyahu insisted that Israel will remain ""the master of its fate"" in ensuring that Iran not obtain a nuclear weapon. ""Israel must reserve the right to defend itself, and after all, that's the very purpose of the Jewish state: to restore to the Jewish people control over our destiny,"" Netanyahu said. Blitzer's blog: What does Israel really want? Tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. U.S. and Israeli officials have said they suspect that Iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon. Both have said they will act to prevent that from occurring. Earlier Monday, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Director General Yukiya Amano, reiterated agency statements that it cannot say whether Iran's nuclear program is peaceful. Amano said the IAEA  ""continues to have serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions."" Monday's White House meeting lasted for two hours, with the leaders then taking part in a working lunch with their delegations, according to senior U.S. administration officials who spoke on condition of not being identified. Late Monday, the White House released a statement on the meeting, echoing many of the same themes touched on earlier in the day. Obama ""reiterated the United States' commitment to pursuing a strategy of principled diplomacy, backed by unprecedented pressure, including the additional sanctions that are taking hold on the Iranian regime,"" the statement read. During the meeting, Netanyahu was expected to press Obama for clarity on what would constitute the ""red line"" on nuclear arms that would cause the United States to strike Iran. However, the senior administration officials said Israel did not expect the Obama administration to shift from its stance that opposes Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, compared with Israel's opposition to Iran gaining even the capability of developing a nuclear weapon. Obama, meanwhile, was considered likely to push Israel to refrain from any military action on its own in order to give diplomacy and expanded sanctions against Iran a full chance to resolve the issue. He will hold a news conference on Tuesday. Obama is under criticism over his Iran policy from Republican opponents, including the leading GOP contenders to run against him in November's U.S. elections. Republicans call for a stronger public stance against the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon. Accusing the White House of embracing a policy of ""appeasement"" toward Iran, GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum said the president has ""turned his back on the state of Israel."" He said Obama is ""all talk and no action"" on the matter of Iran and its putative nuclear aspirations. Santorum made the comments in Westerville, a suburb of Columbus, during his final push through the state before Tuesday's Ohio primary. Speaking Sunday to AIPAC, Obama warned that ""all elements of American power"" remain an option to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, though the president also made clear that he prefers diplomacy over war. ""Too much loose talk of war with Iran"" only benefits the Iranian government by driving up the price of oil, Obama said to the pro-Israel lobby group. Obama said his policy is not containment of a nuclear Iran but preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. At the same time, he emphasized that Iran ""should not doubt Israel's sovereign right to make its own decisions about what is required to meet its security needs."" While Obama's statements are consistent with his past pronouncements, his specific reference to preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon -- rather than the capability of building a nuclear weapon -- maintained what some consider to be a difference between his and Netanyahu's position. Israeli officials say that if Iran were to become able to enrich weapons-grade uranium, it would potentially cross the ""red line"" of nuclear weapons capability that Israel fears. In a statement issued Sunday after Obama's speech, Netanyahu expressed appreciation for the president's position that all options are on the table to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. ""I also appreciated the fact that he made clear that, when it comes to a nuclear-armed Iran, containment is simply not an option,"" Netanyahu said, ""and equally, in my judgment, perhaps most important of all, I appreciated the fact that he said that Israel must be able to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.""",""" None of us can afford to wait much longer,"" Netanyahu warns .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama will welcome his Gabonese counterpart to the White House on Thursday, a day after a visit with another African leader. Obama and President Ali Bongo Ondimba will discuss regional issues and bilateral topics. Ondimba was elected in 2009 following the death of his father, Omar Bongo, who had ruled the nation for 42 years. White House press secretary Jay Carney defended the invitation Wednesday when asked whether it was appropriate to invite the leader, whom U.S. officials have accused of corruption. ""Gabon is holding the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council; it's an important position,"" Carney said at a news briefing. ""Moreover, Gabon has voted in ways that we consider very helpful on issues like Cote d'Ivoire, Libya and Iran. It has been an important ally in our efforts in those countries through the United Nations."" Obama is meeting with the leader as he does with others ""who have less than sterling"" records, the press secretary said. Though human rights concerns remain an issue in the country, Ondimba has made several reforms, according to Carney. ""So we're obviously -- we think it's definitely a worthwhile meeting,"" he said. The tiny Gabon, which has a population of about 1.5 million, is a major oil producer in Africa. His visit comes a day after Obama and Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan discussed regional and global developments. The White House has announced that first lady Michelle Obama will travel to South Africa and Botswana this month.","White House press secretary defends decision to invite the leader .

"Lance Armstrong admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired Thursday night. Did he use EPO? Testosterone? Cortisone? Human growth hormone? Illegal blood transfusions and other blood doping? Armstrong answered ""yes"" on all counts. In October, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency released more than 1,000 pages of evidence in doping allegations against Armstrong and his teammates. He was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles in the scandal. On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee demanded that he give back the bronze medal he won in 2000. The charges against Armstrong are all too common in the cycling world. Cyclist Floyd Landis was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title after failing a drug test. Eighty percent of the Tour de France medalists between 1996 and 2010 have been ""similarly tainted by doping,"" according to the USADA report on Armstrong. A look at the drugs Armstrong used: . Blood doping . EPO, or erythropoietin, is a hormone naturally produced by human kidneys to stimulate red blood cell production, according to the World Anti-Doping Agency. Cyclists and other athletes use EPO to raise their red blood cell counts, which increases the amount of oxygen that can be delivered to muscles, improving recovery and endurance. Although EPO has been banned since the 1990s, the first screening test was used at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney. Blood transfusions have a similar effect on the body's red blood cell count. Usually an athlete will store some of his blood when his hemoglobin levels are high, then reinfuse it right before an event. This type of transfusion cannot be detected by current tests, according to the USADA. Both methods can have dangerous side effects. Increased levels of hemoglobin, which literally thickens the blood, can lead to complications with circulation, putting athletes at risk for cardiovascular problems. Corticosteroids . Corticosteroids are man-made drugs that resemble the natural hormone cortisol, according to the Cleveland Clinic. These are different from anabolic steroids, which athletes take to increase strength. The most common types are cortisone, prednisone and methylprednisolone. Cortisol is most commonly known as a stress hormone. Corticosteroids work to decrease inflammation that can cause swelling and pain, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They can be administered locally -- to the specific area that hurts -- or systemically through a pill or intravenously. The list of possible side effects for corticosteroids is long, including weight gain, sudden mood swings, blurred vision, osteoporosis and high blood pressure. ""If steroid use involves high doses and is prolonged (for a few months to several years), an increase in the number of side effects might occur,"" the clinic's site states. Testosterone . Testosterone is a naturally occurring hormone that helps regulate bone density, fat distribution, muscle strength, red blood cell production and sex drive, according to the Mayo Clinic. It is found in both men and women; in men, it also helps to regulate sperm production. Athletes generally abuse testosterone to ""bulk up,"" according to the USADA. The side effects are similar to both blood doping and anabolic steroid use. Testosterone increases the body's red blood cell count, increasing the risk for cardiovascular disease. Mood swings, muscle weakness and liver dysfunction are also common for both sexes with overuse. Using testosterone also shuts down the body's natural production of the hormone. This can cause the testicles to shrink in men, reducing sperm production. Moving forward . Cyclists say Armstrong's confession and calls to clean up the sport may lead to a new era. ""From day one, we always hoped this investigation would bring to a close this troubling chapter in cycling's history and we hope the sport will use this tragedy to prevent it from ever happening again,"" USADA CEO Travis Tygart said in a statement in October. ""Our mission is to protect clean athletes by preserving the integrity of competition not only for today's athletes but also the athletes of tomorrow. We have heard from many athletes who have faced an unfair dilemma -- dope, or don't compete at the highest levels of the sport. Many of them abandoned their dreams and left sport because they refused to endanger their health and participate in doping. That is a tragic choice no athlete should have to make."" What did you think of Oprah Winfrey's interview with Armstrong?","Lance Armstrong admits to using EPO, blood transfusions and testosterone .

"The abduction of a French family, including four children, in a remote part of Cameroon has fueled fears that Western civilians living and working in parts of Africa are becoming targets of Islamist militant groups -- especially in the wake of France's military intervention in Mali. The family spent Monday at Waza National Park -- a thickly-forested area popular with tourists close to the borders with Nigeria and Chad.  Tuesday morning, they began the drive south when they were ambushed and abducted by several armed men on motorbikes, officials said. The children's father is an employee of the French company GDF Suez and is based in Yaounde, in the south of Cameroon. GDF Suez, which is developing a natural gas liquefaction project in Cameroon, expressed its concern and said it was working closely with the French Foreign Ministry. Waza is in a remote part of the country where the borders are porous and criminal and terrorist groups are able to operate freely, according to regional analysts. French officials immediately pointed the finger at the Nigerian group Boko Haram, which has waged a three-year terror campaign against Christians in northern Nigeria as well as attacking police stations and more moderate Muslims in authority. It has also been able to take advantage of porous borders with Chad and Cameroon. French President Francois Hollande said during a visit to Athens on Tuesday: ""I am aware of the presence of Boko Haram in that part of Cameroon, and that's worrying enough."" Hollande said he does not believe that the kidnapping took place because of his country's intervention in Mali. ""There is a great danger of terrorism in a big part of west Africa, including as far as Cameroon,"" said Hollande, calling on French nationals to exercise caution in West Africa. Hollande said it was likely the kidnappers planned to take the family of seven across the border into Nigeria and said France would do everything possible to prevent that. But, in this remote area, French options are limited. Throughout West Africa and the Sahel, Westerners have become targets for both militant groups and criminal gangs, which are sometimes indistinguishable. Altogether, 15 French citizens are now being held by various groups in the region, six of them by groups aligned with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Some 6,000 French citizens live in Cameroon, part of which was once a French colony. In December, Francis Collomp, a French engineer working in the northern Nigerian state of Katsina, was kidnapped by a jihadist group calling itself Ansar al-Muslimeen. And on Sunday, Ansaru, as it's also known, launched a much more ambitious operation in Bauchi state,  kidnapping seven foreign contractors working on a construction project in response to the ""transgression and atrocities done to the religion of Allah by European countries in places such as Afghanistan and Mali."" Boko Haram has links with some of the Islamist militant factions in Mali, and there have been persistent reports that fighters from the group had joined jihadist camps around the city of Gao, which until this month was under the control of a group associated with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Last year, Gen.Carter Ham, who leads the U.S.Africa Command. said ""linkages between AQIM and Boko Haram are probably the most worrisome in terms of the indications we have that they are likely sharing funds, training and explosive materials."" More recently, Ham said the U.S. Defense Department had begun feeding intelligence about the group to the Nigerian military. John Campbell, a former U.S. ambassador in Nigeria now with the Council on Foreign Relations, said last month that if Boko Haram really had developed links with al Qaeda ""it would seem likely that Boko Haram will escalate their attacks in northern Nigeria in solidarity with their Islamic brothers. If that happens, there will be yet more pressure on the already overstretched Nigerian forces."" Nigeria is leading a group of West African countries supporting the French mission in Nigeria, further straining its ability to deal with Islamic extremism at home. Campbell told CNN on Tuesday that until there was some claim of responsibility, it was difficult to be sure that the abduction in Cameroon had a political dimension. Kidnapping has become a lucrative business in parts of West Africa. Campbell also noted that while Ansaru has been quick to claim responsibility for its previous actions, Boko Haram had been largely silent in recent months. The relationship between the two is unclear, according to analysts of jihadist groups in West Africa. Both Boko Haram and Ansaru first emerged in the northern Nigerian city of Maiduguri. Andrew Lebovich, who has followed the evolution of both groups, says Ansaru broke away from Boko Haram a year ago and ""has since become known for its similarities and suspected links to AQIM and allied groups such as the Movement for Tawhid and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO)."" Ansaru has taken a more hostile attitude toward France. It said the abduction of Collomp was in response to the French government's stance on Islam -- including the ban on the wearing of the veil in public and in French schools. Boko Haram is more focused on what it sees as discrimination against Muslims in Nigeria. Recently,  like the Pakistani Taliban,  it has extended its attacks to target doctors and health workers involved in polio vaccinations. The emergence of two apparently resilient terror groups in northern Nigeria, and the surge in attacks on foreigners, pose growing challenges for a government and military already struggling to exert their authority across large areas of Africa's most populous nation.","Seven French family members abducted in Cameroon .

"(CNN)Eight crew members are missing after a cargo vessel overturned off the coast of Scotland, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution said late Saturday. The search for the crew was suspended Sunday night with no sign of them, the Maritime & Coastguard Agency said. A search operation that included a helicopter, coast guard rescue teams and a fixed-wing aircraft was unsuccessful, the agency said. The coast guard in Shetland was notified at 2:30 p.m. that the hull of the Cemfjord was found 11 miles east of Pentland Skerries, the RNLI said. Photographs showed the vessel in a vertical position, one end jutting from the water. Meanwhile, 25 crew members were airlifted from a boat that ran aground off the coast of southern England, below Southampton, the Maritime & Coastguard Agency reported. Helicopters lifted the crew from the car carrier, which listed dramatically to one side. The ship ran aground on Bramble Bank near the Isle of Wight.","Search suspended for 8 missing crew members of a ship .

"Sao Paulo (CNN)How's this for a miraculous outcome? A Brazilian man who was stabbed in the head during an argument survived despite the knife being lodged in his skull for over three hours. Motorcycle taxi driver Juacelo Nunes de Oliveira was at a party in a bar in the city of Agua Branca, in northeastern Piaui state, last Sunday when he got into an altercation. The 39-year-old was stabbed four times, three times in the torso, with one wound perforating a lung, and once in the head. He was first taken for treatment at a nearby hospital before being transferred to the Emergency Hospital of Teresina, a city 100 kilometers (62 miles) away -- with the knife handle protruding from his head all the while. ""It took him nearly three hours to arrive here at the hospital,"" Dr. Gilberto Albuquerque, general surgeon and hospital director, told CNN on Friday. ""He had the knife lodged in his head for this whole period but he was not aware of it,"" he said.  ""We believe the shock and a bit of the drinking may have helped him not to understand the knife was still in his head."" Pictures released by the military show Oliveira lying on a hospital trolley with what looks like a kitchen knife embedded in his skull up to the handle, just to the side of his left eyebrow. According to Albuquerque, the knife stopped only when it got stuck in the man's lower jaw. Oliveira was very lucky, he said -- and not just to be alive. ""The knife crossed his head just behind the optical nerve, got very close to the olfactory nerve and (was) just a fraction from the gustatory nerve. He could have been blinded and could have lost his senses of smell and taste, but none of that happened and he is alive and healthy."" The surgery to remove the knife was very delicate, since any slip could have breached arteries and led the patient to bleed to death, Albuquerque said. It took the hospital surgery team two and half hours to complete, and was considered to be a success. ""He left the hospital yesterday, five days after coming in with a knife in his head,"" Albuquerque said.  ""He is healthy and perfect and he had no ill after-effects.""","Juacelo Nunes de Oliveira was stabbed three times in the torso and once in the head .

"""Reading Rainbow"" made its TV debut in 1983 with a simple idea: Use television to keep kids reading during summer by urging them to ""take a look"" in a book. The popular public television show ended its run in 2009, but host and actor LeVar Burton hasn't stepped away from children's literacy, or the ideas behind the beloved show. On Wednesday, Burton launched a $1 million Kickstarter campaign to raise money for a Web-based digital library of ""Reading Rainbow"" books and videos. It exceeded its fund-raising goal by the end of the first day. Burton said the new tool will allow more children and educators to access ""Reading Rainbow"" materials, beyond those using the popular ""Reading Rainbow"" mobile app. The Web version will be accessible through a subscription, but aims to provide ""Reading Rainbow"" for free to disadvantaged classrooms. ""If you are a reader, then you have the ability to educate yourself,"" Burton said. ""When you have the ability to be a lifelong learner, there are no limits on what you can acquire in terms of knowledge and information. It represents the ultimate freedom of mankind."" After all, what makes a good story hasn't changed much since ""Reading Rainbow's"" debut, Burton said. Technology has. Burton said he realized the power of TV as a medium for educating and informing viewers when he played Kunta Kinte on the ""Roots"" miniseries, based on Alex Haley's novel about slavery and African-American history. The story captured the nation as millions tuned in to watch the miniseries during the late 1970s. Decades later, after reading a book on an iPad for the first time, he saw the potential to create an interactive reading experience. Burton acquired the rights to the ""Reading Rainbow"" brand and created his company, RRKidz. He envisioned an app that could interact with the audience in ways the show never could. He launched the ""Reading Rainbow"" app in 2012, and in its first 18 months, users read 10 million books, making it the No. 1 free educational app in the iTunes store for two years. ""I wanted to put in the hands of kids a library of books and videos, like the TV show did, all in the service of inspiring a love of literature and exploring the world -- connecting the real world to the literature that kids are reading,"" said Burton, who received the Impact Award for his efforts to instill ""a lifelong love of reading in children"" during Children's Book Week this month. Burton's efforts come at a time when researchers and educators are trying to figure out how to use technology to encourage reading. Since 1984, the proportion of adolescents who read for pleasure once a week or more has dropped from 81% to 76% among 9-year-olds, according to research released this week by advocacy group Common Sense Media. Among 13-year-olds, rates of reading for pleasure have dropped from 70% to 53%. Among 17-year-olds, the rate dropped from 64% to 40%. The proportion who say they ""never"" or ""hardly ever"" read has gone from 8% of 13-year-olds and 9% of 17-year-olds in 1984 to 22% and 27%, respectively. ""E-reading has the potential to significantly change the nature of reading for children and families, but its impact is still unknown,"" said the Common Sense Media report ""Children, Teens and Reading."" On the TV show, Burton became a trusted friend to children, parents and educators, recommending a variety of books and taking viewers on book-related field trips. He invited kids to recommend books in a segment, using the famous line, ""but you don't have to take my word for it."" ""The books were enhanced by the show and the show brought people to read the books,"" said Starr LaTronica, president of the Association for Library Service to Children. ""It sort of lays the groundwork for research later in life because LeVar always took those books, found out something about them and went further."" In the app incarnation of ""Reading Rainbow,"" children navigate the app in a virtual hot air balloon, traveling to themed islands and discovering books they might like to read. The app hosts more than 500 books and video field trips with Burton. Users can interact with the stories like it's a game and receive rewards for each book they read. Parents are encouraged to use the app along with their children, filling in youngsters' interests for reading recommendations or exploring lessons and themes within the books together. Kids can read by themselves, with their parents or have Burton narrate. The app is free to download, with a $9.99 monthly or $29.99 six-month fee for accessing and downloading unlimited books to read. ""Elementary school-age children are at a juncture where you have such a great opportunity to capture them as readers at that point,"" said Nicole Deming of the Children's Book Council. ""The app has struck that ideal balance between enhancing the storytelling without being distracting."" Burton said he hopes the web-based version of ""Reading Rainbow"" will be tailored to classroom teachers and homeschoolers. It will  include lesson plans and tools to track students' reading progress. Burton said he also would like to see more diversity in children's literature. ""Reading Rainbow"" will continue to share a variety of books, just as he did on the show, he said. ""I firmly believe that seeing oneself reflected in the popular culture is critically important for developing a solid and healthy sense of self,"" he said. ""Unless the publishing industry is proactive, this will be one of the causes of its demise. I don't understand the reluctance. Here is a sector that is woefully underserved, with an opportunity to target a market that is thirsty for literature."" Still, not everything has changed. Just as Burton's mother nurtured his interest in reading, parents and children can bond through books, whether on paper or tablets. ""There is nothing more powerful to me than that elemental experience of storytelling: being read to aloud, following along, seeing the story in the pictures and feeling it in your heart,"" Burton said. ""It is really beautifully, brilliantly embodied in the sharing of a children's book."" What were your favorite books as a young reader?

"(CNN) -- Leave it to Shia LaBeouf to give one of the strangest -- or most creative -- interviews of all time. For a recent sitdown with Dazed and Confused magazine, the actor/performance artist decided that he didn't want to use words to communicate and instead let his eyes do all the talking. The result is an hour-long video in which LaBeouf and his interviewer, Aimee Cliff, sit and stare at each other in near silence. (No words are exchanged, but there is some awkward laughter.) According to Cliff, this was all LaBeouf's idea. He reached out to the Dazed writer in September, and the two soon struck up an email correspondence. In a series of exchanges, they cover topics including metamodernism, faith, cynicism and even a claim by LaBeouf that he was sexually assaulted during a performance art exhibit this year. After a bit of back-and-forth, LaBeouf agreed to do what he calls ""the #interview."" ""I like the idea that we meet in person with a go pro photographic record but no interview,"" the actor wrote in one of his emails to Cliff. ""we just look into each others eyes for an hour, connect on a soul level and film that as the interview and keep the words online so we will will both have go pro cameras strapped to our heads for the full hour and the footage will be presented raw as a split screen and you can use it on the Dazed video site."" Indeed, the full video is now up and ready for viewing. INTERVIEW from RÃ¶nkkÃ¶ / Turner on Vimeo. By doing it this way, ""I'm present in the magazine only in words obtained digitally and online I'm present only through a mute physical presence,"" LaBeouf concluded. ""(A)nd the reality of my self lies somewhere between and beyond the two it's thoroughly metamodern I think."" While the video shows LaBeouf and Cliff in their staring competition, their emails are overflowing with language. At one point, LaBeouf opens up about his #IAmSorry performance art exhibit from this year, when he encouraged visitors to come and view him one-on-one in a small room. Before seeing him, visitors were encouraged to pick up an item from a table of ""implements,"" which included things like a ""Transformers"" toy, a whip (he starred in 2008's ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""), Hershey's kisses, a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey, a bottle of cologne, pliers and a ukelele. Once they stepped into the room with LaBeouf, they would sit across a table from the actor, who was wearing a paper bag over his head that read, ""I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE."" LaBeouf has said that the art exhibit didn't go the way he anticipated; he thought people were going to be rude or mean, but once they were face-to-face with him, there were more often displays of humanity. ""I went from being a celebrity or object to a fellow human,"" LaBeouf said in his email exchange with Dazed. ""(I)t happened in less than a second for some for others they needed to take the bag off but it usually happened and by 'it' i mean connection it was a very human encounter once it was 2 people in a room."" The title of the project was a genuine reflection of how he felt at the time, LaBeouf continued. ""i was broken - it wasn't manipulation - i was heartbroken and people I've never met before came in and loved on me and with me some for multiple days some would come in hold my hand and cry with me some would come in and tell me to 'figure it out' to 'be a man' in the end i felt cared for however it came - it was beautiful it blew me away I've never experienced love like that, empathy humanity, understanding"" Not every encounter was as exemplary in its kindness, though. There was one visitor whom LaBeouf alleges sexually assaulted him. ""one woman who came with her boyfriend who was out side the door when this happened whipped my legs for 10 minutes and then striped my clothing and proceeded to rape me then walked out with her lipstick smudged to her awaiting boyfriend who i image was quite hurt by it"" Not to mention LaBeouf's girlfriend, who he said was in line to view his exhibition the same day this event happened. ""it really hurt her as well as i guess the news of it traveled through the line she was only about 25 people back when she came in she asked for an (explanation) and i couldn't speak so we both sat with this unexplained trauma silently it was painful the hardest part of the show"" LaBeouf's had a hard year overall, including legal trouble. In June, he was charged with disorderly conduct, harassment and criminal trespass after being accused of drunken and disruptive behavior in a Broadway venue. He spent a little time in jail, but the charges were settled on the grounds that LaBeouf would continue seeking treatment for alcohol addiction. But with projects like #IAmSorry, LaBeouf said he's seeking a sense of purpose. ""Im finding my self through these projects,"" he explained to Dazed. ""im exploring.""","Shia LaBeouf conducted a completely silent in-person interview .

"Sometimes, residents of the Middle East have a hard time taking a joke. This, at least, is how the editor of the satirical blog the Pan-Arabia Enquirer sees it. The website, based in Dubai and self-dubbed ""the world's only 7-star satirical news source,"" gets roughly 400,000 page views per month and is often likened to The Onion. According to its editor, some of the most popular stories are often confused for bona fide fact. ""Judging by the response it gets, I'd say it's a 50-50 split between those that think it's a joke, and those that really don't,"" says the editor, who prefers to remain anonymous (""Our stories generate anger from people who are outraged, and I don't want to be the focal point of that anger,"" he says). A story published last month claiming a new gold-class lane would be introduced on the road from Dubai to Abu Dhabi -- which the site joked would be paved in gold and separated from the other lanes with a velvet rope -- provoked earnest ire. ""This is sick. Faux-elite structures build on the back of internationally-sourced slave labor in lifestyles financed by unearned oil revenues. I am appalled at the news that comes out of this country,"" wrote one commenter. Read more: Arab youth find comic relief in stand-up . An article on the site about Emirates Airlines introducing shisha lounges to their flights actually inspired a few UAE residents to contact the carrier for more information. It was also picked up by a few travel websites, and published as fact. ""Even the terribly photoshopped picture,"" he marvels. As for why his readers seem so gullible, he attributes it to the infancy of satire in the Middle East. ""Satire isn't exactly alien, but it's not a known concept in the region. People here have a tendency to believe everything that is put in a newspaper,"" he notes. Whether the art form is new or not is subject to debate. Still, many agree that it is ripening in the region. ""We've always had room for satire, though maybe it was more widespread in Lebanon -- due to their strong TV channels, political system and level of freedom of speech -- though it's always been around in Jordan in terms of play shows, newspaper columnists and caricatures,"" notes Fadi Zaghmout, the Jordanian blogger behind The Arab Observer, and one of the Pan-Arabia Enquirer's 4,500 Twitter followers. ""I do see it gaining ground now,"" he adds. Read more: In the Middle East, cartoons can kill . Pan-Arabia's editor says that while some people don't get the joke, many seem to find the site a lifeline. ""I definitely think there's a hunger for it,"" he says. ""We get comments from people who say, 'thank God there's something like this here, I was going out of my skull,' and readers are starting to send in their own stories.

Of course in many ways, the Middle East is not an easy place to be a satirist. Earlier this month, Bassem Youssef, the Egyptian talk show often likened to Jon Stewart, had his show suspended after he started poking fun at the country's military regime. Other comics in the region have faced similar fates. Sami Fehri, a Tunisian producer of a political puppet show, was imprisoned for a year on corruption charges, and in July, Saudi blogger Raif Badawi was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes for mocking religious figures. ""This is what has put us down as a community, as a population, for so long. We can't really talk back,"" Youssef told CNN in an interview earlier this year. ""People equate being laughed at as being ridiculed, [saying] 'I can't be ridiculed by this little dot dot dot brat. But if you start to suppress people's freedom of speech under any excuse you want, it's not good for the country,"" he added. Pan-Arabia's editor, who says he admires Youssef's humor and bravery greatly, finds his suspension from television somewhat ironic. ""There he was, happily mocking [former president Mohamed] Morsy, and he got arrested, and everyone went out on the street pushing for free speech and he gets put back on air. Then everything changes, and he goes on air and mocks [General Abdel Fattah] el-Sisi, and everyone's in uproar.

"(CNN)The Islamist militant group Boko Haram kidnapped 40 boys and young men -- ages 10 to 23 -- from a village in the northeastern Nigerian state of Borno, some of those fleeing said Saturday. The terrorists arrived in the village of Malari carrying assault rifles and then preached to them about the group's extremist ideology before forcibly taking 40 hostages and driving toward the Sambisa forest on December 31, villagers who fled to Maiduguri said. It took days for information on this mass abduction to emerge due to poor communications stemming from the destruction of cell phone towers in previous Boko Haram attacks.This act, while horrific, is hardly unprecedented. Boko Haram has been blamed for numerous attacks, from assassinations of officials to bombings of crowded markets, in recent years as part of its quest to impose a strict version of Sharia law across Nigeria. Mass kidnappings have been part of that campaign, most notably the taking of more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok in April. There was talk of a ceasefire deal that would pave the way for the girls' release, but Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau laughed it off, claiming that those abducted had converted to Islam and been married off. Boko Haram leader says 200 abducted girls married off . As the latest incident proves, it's not only young women who have been targeted. Boko Haram kidnapped at least 97 young men and boys in a deadly raid in August in and around the village of Doron Baga, a local leader and residents said. Twenty-eight residents died, and 25 more were injured in that raid, according to residents. Journalist Aminu Abubakar reported from Kano, Nigeria. CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.","Armed Boko Haram militants went into a village, preached, then abducted 40 .

"Rrrrrchaelogists have recovered five big six pounders from t' wreck o' t' famed scurvy dog Blackbeard's ship off t' coast o' North Carolina. Now, for those of you who don't speak pirate:. Five cannons from the Queen Anne's Revenge, the sunken flagship of Edward Teach (better known as Blackbeard), were recovered Monday by scientists from the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources after nearly 300 years under the water of Beaufort Inlet. The team, working with the Coast Guard, brought the big guns --  2,000 and 3,000 pounds -- to the surface of Beaufort Inlet on Monday. Billy Ray Morris, who manages the expedition, said he thinks the largest cannon is likely Swedish-made, as was another of the 40 big guns onboard that was already recovered. The project wrapped up for the year, but archaeologists will return for one more season in 2014. The catch brings to 20 the number of cannons that have been salvaged from the ship. Each of the guns once fired 6-pound cannonballs. No word if any of the cannons was loaded. They likely will be added to the Queen Ann's Revenge exhibit in Beaufort, which has more than 280,000 artifacts. Romanticized in history books as a notorious ruffian, Blackbeard, born in Britain, terrorized Atlantic seafarers from the shores of the American colonies to the Caribbean. Blackbeard survived after the ship was intentionally grounded in June 1718. He left hundreds of his crew marooned, sort of an 18th century corporate downsizing, and apparently took most of the booty. The Queen Anne's Revenge's remains are scuttled two miles off the North Carolina coast in 25 feet of water. Blackbeard made it six more months before he was killed in a battle with British troops. His severed head was displayed on the bowsprit of the victors' ship.","A total of 20 cannons have been recovered from the Queen Anne's Revenge .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met for more than three hours Tuesday evening amid a dispute over Israel's decision to build new Jewish housing on disputed land in East Jerusalem. The Obama administration has pushed to restart peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians and has called on Israel to stop building settlements on territory it captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Netanyahu's meeting at the White House came the day after he defended his government's plans to build new housing units in East Jerusalem, a move that has strained ties with Israel's largest ally. Netanyahu got to the White House at 5:30 p.m., and he conferred with Obama for nearly 90 minutes in the Oval Office, from 5:34 to 7:03 p.m. A White House official said the president then went to his residence and Netanyahu remained at the White House to consult with his staff in the Roosevelt Room. Netanyahu requested another meeting with Obama, who returned to the Oval Office to meet with Netanyahu from 8:20 p.m. to 8:55 p.m., said the official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss details of the meeting. Netanyahu left the White House at 9:05 p.m. without speaking to reporters at a stakeout. The Israeli leader arrived after a show of solidarity with leaders of Congress from both parties, during which he thanked the U.S. lawmakers for their ""constant support"" and ""unflagging"" friendship. ""Even though the challenges are immense, our will and our partnership is also immense,"" Netanyahu said at an appearance with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""We have no stronger ally anywhere in the world than Israel and we all know that we're in a difficult moment, but I'm glad the prime minister is here ... so we can have an open and straightforward dialogue about how we can provide more security for our friends in Israel and do everything we can to make sure that the Iranians have no ability to develop a nuclear weapon,"" Boehner said. Pelosi told reporters that Congress speaks with ""one voice"" on the subject of Israel. ""Together we remain committed to advancing the peace process, preserving Israel's security, responsible sanctions against Iran,"" she said. Netanyahu's visit to Washington comes as Israel and the United States find themselves at odds over Israel's plan to build new housing on disputed land in East Jerusalem -- a plan he defended sharply Monday night. Israel's announcement two weeks ago that it plans to build 1,600 apartments in an area claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians came amid an Obama administration push for new Israeli-Palestinian talks, but Netanyahu told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that ""the connection between the Jewish people and Jerusalem cannot be denied."" ""The Jewish people were building Jerusalem 3,000 years ago, and the Jewish people are building Jerusalem today,"" he told AIPAC, the leading pro-Israel lobby in the United States, to prolonged applause. ""Jerusalem is not a settlement. It is our capital."" Palestinian leaders have refused to rejoin peace talks until Israel freezes the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. But Netanyahu said ""everyone knows"" the neighborhoods where the new housing units will be built ""will be part of Israel in any peace settlement,"" and the new construction ""in no way precludes the possibility of a two-state solution."" The State Department carefully avoided criticism of Netanyahu on Tuesday. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters the United States would continue conversations with Israel and efforts to create ""an atmosphere of trust"" between Israel and the Palestinians. ""Do we see eye to eye on everything? No,"" Crowley told reporters at the State Department. ""Are we satisfied with the exchange and the seriousness the prime minister has taken our concerns on board? We are. And this is a conversation that has involved the secretary and obviously today will involve the president as well."" Netanyahu met Monday with Vice President Joe Biden and with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has called the Israeli announcement insulting. In her own speech to AIPAC, she said the U.S. commitment to Israel's security was ""rock-solid"" -- but added that as ""Israel's friend, it is our responsibility to give credit when it is due and to tell the truth when it is needed."" ""We objected to this announcement because we are committed to Israel and its security, which we believe depends on a comprehensive peace -- because we are determined to keep moving forward along a path that ensures Israel's future as a secure and democratic Jewish state living in peace with its Palestinian and Arab neighbors,"" Clinton said. The United States is Israel's leading ally and provides nearly $3 billion a year in aid to the Jewish state, about three-quarters of which goes to purchase U.S. military equipment. AIPAC has called on the Obama administration to step back from its ""public demands and unilateral deadlines directed at Israel,"" but Clinton defended the administration's call for Israel to stop building in largely Arab East Jerusalem. Dan Meridor, Israel's deputy prime minister, told CNN's ""Amanpour"" that construction on the project announced earlier this month would not begin for at least two years, ""according to the normal process of planning."" ""So this is really not a problem now,"" Meridor said. CNN's Charley Keyes and Alison Harding contributed to this report.","Obama, Netanyahu met for more than three hours at the White House on Tuesday .

"The number of unaccompanied minor immigrants who have crossed into the United States has officially surpassed the 60,000 expected in the Obama administration's initial estimates, according to Department of Homeland Security data. Internal DHS figures show the number for the fiscal year, which ends in October, stands at more than 62,000 as of the end of last week, according to a U.S. official. The child-immigrant crisis was at the center of the roiling political fight in recent days. The Republican-controlled House shelved and then, late Friday night, passed legislation to force the Obama administration to more quickly deport the undocumented immigrants. The bill has no realistic chance of becoming law. The administration has since produced new estimates of up to 90,000 unaccompanied minors by year's end. The vast majority are from the Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. While the administration says the number of unaccompanied minor immigrants appear to be slowing recently, this year's figure already is significantly higher than the 38,293 of the previous two fiscal years combined.","Internal DHS figures: Current count for fiscal year ending in October is over 62,000 .

"France will not negotiate with the Islamist rebels who kidnapped a French family in Cameroon, Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Tuesday. ""We do not negotiate on these bases, with those groups,"" Le Drian said on French radio station RTL. ""We will use all possible means to secure the release of hostages."" The radio announcement comes a day after rebels in Nigeria released a chilling video of the family that was abducted in neighboring Cameroon. The seven-member family was flanked by armed fighters from the Boko Haram movement in the brief video. One of the captive men read a statement demanding that Nigeria and Cameroon free jailed members of Boko Haram, which is battling to establish Islamic rule in northern Nigeria, and their families. ""Meet all the demands we have mentioned, and if you leave out one of them, we will kill these hostages,"" the masked man says. France blasts 'cruelty' as Boko Haram displays kidnapped family . The family -- a couple, their four children and an uncle -- were seized in a national park in remote northern Cameroon on February 19. Authorities in Cameroon said they were quickly spirited across the border into Nigeria. ""This is the first time there are children hostages,""  Le Drian said. ""This is an unacceptable situation."" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius denounced the video Monday, saying, ""All of the state services are mobilized to free our countrymen."" ""For all of us, these images are terribly shocking. They demonstrate cruelty without limits,"" Fabius said in a statement. The kidnapping has raised fears of Westerners being targeted by Islamist militant groups in Africa in the wake of the French military intervention against other Islamist rebels in Mali. The masked man in the video says French President Francois Hollande ""started war against Islam, and we must fight him everywhere."" The father works for the French company GDF Suez and is based in Yaounde, the capital in southern Cameroon.

"On Tuesday night, Texas Gov. Rick Perry -- long a public fan of Judaism -- marked the beginning of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah by comparing it to the Boston Tea Party, which was celebrating its 241st anniversary the same day. There is a parallel to be drawn here -- but Perry chose the wrong tea party and the wrong lessons. Let's back up. The Hanukkah story, to which Perry's statement made reference, is a fairly straightforward one: In the second century B.C., a small band of faithful Jews, led by Judah Maccabee, rose up against the oppressive Seleucid Empire, which had taken control of the Temple in Jerusalem, and won a surprising victory. The Maccabees recaptured the Temple and rededicated it to the God of Israel. They found, however, that they had only one day's worth of oil for the holy lamps, the menorah -- but miracle of miracles, that oil lasted for eight days. Hence the Hanukkah we know and love: eight days of candles. It is this story that Perry had in mind when he said, ""The same spirit of freedom that inspired the Maccabees to rise up against a foreign empire motivated our Founding Fathers to rebel against the Crown on that fateful night. They knew, as the Jewish people know, that the few can overcome the many, that right can defeat might, that faith can transcend persecution."" Now, if we're talking about the traditional Hanukkah story described above, there are some problems with Perry's analogy. The most prominent might be the definition of ""freedom."" For the Maccabees, what was at stake was the very existence of Judaism: The Temple, the very seat of God's dwelling on earth, was in the hands of pagans who prohibited Jewish worship there. The Boston Tea Party was a complaint about excessive taxes. Now, it's true that some Republicans have exhibited something close to religious fervor about the question of taxation in America. But we should not confuse economic oppression with religious persecution. That ""faith can transcend persecution"" is usually not one of the lessons associated with the Revolutionary War. (Though it is the sort of language that one hears from the far right these days, almost regardless of whether the topic actually has anything to do with religion.) There's also a question of degree. The Boston Tea Party may have been an important symbolic act, and one whose importance has only grown with time, but it was still a symbolic act. This was people dressed up in costumes tossing tea into the water, to make a point to a government 3,000 miles away. The Revolutionary War didn't start for another two years after the Tea Party. The Maccabees took up swords -- swords! -- against an occupying imperial army. Perhaps more important: the traditional Hanukkah story, charming though it is, isn't what actually happened, or why. It's true, the Maccabees took up arms to retake the Temple. But their fight wasn't really with the Seleucids, it was with other Jews. For decades a bitter debate had raged among the Jews of the Hellenistic Empire: to assimilate or not to assimilate. In Jerusalem, in the Temple, the assimilationists had gained the upper hand and collaborated closely with the imperial powers. This caused great dismay among the orthodox traditionalists, mostly living in the country, and a civil war seemed imminent. The Seleucids stepped in to prevent any violence -- but, naturally, they took the side of the assimilationists. The Maccabees were country boys, on the side of the traditionalists. When they recaptured the Temple, they were taking it back not only from the Seleucids, but from the assimilationist Jews who had (in the minds of the Maccabees and their followers) corrupted the old ways of worship. As for the miracle of the oil lasting for eight days: That part of the story wasn't invented until hundreds of years later. It appears for the first time in the Talmud, which was finished in around the sixth century A.D. The real miracle of the Hanukkah event was the military victory of a small guerrilla force against an imperial army, and that's what was celebrated for centuries thereafter. In this light, Perry's analogy to the Tea Party seems somewhat more apt -- but the analogy should be to the modern tea party movement, not to the Boston Tea Party of 1773. A small group, mostly originating outside the urban centers, which considers itself to be upholding the old customs and beliefs of its nation, and which is vigorously opposed to the inclusion of foreign elements in the national culture -- that could be either the Maccabees or the tea party. Throw in the occasional language of secession or government overthrow and we're almost all the way there. This would seem to be strong ground for Perry to stand on: the tea party as modern Maccabees. The problem is that the rule established by the Maccabees wasn't quite as glorious as their initial victory. Within a century of taking power in Jerusalem, the dynasty established by the Maccabees had become as Hellenized and assimilationist as the one it had overthrown. (Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.) Its leaders took on the imperial title of ""king"" and took Greek names, and fought among themselves just as the Jewish rulers had before the Maccabees took over. A little more than 100 years after the great victory of independence, Jerusalem was retaken by the Romans, and Herod the Great took command as king of the Jews. It is thus something of a grave historical error for Perry's statement to take this as the lesson of Hanukkah: ""Our Republic, like the light of the ancient Menorah, has lasted longer than anyone could have predicted."" The myth of the long-lasting menorah is a distraction from the historical reality of the short-lived Jewish independence that followed the rededication of the Temple. Perhaps worse, Perry said: ""Chanukah reminds us of the power of faith to sustain a nation and ensure the security of our ally, Israel."" As the Maccabees learned long ago, and as modern Israelis well know today, faith is never a guarantee of national security.","Rick Perry compares Hanukkah to the Boston Tea Party .

"(CNN)Thomas Eric Duncan is both the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and the first person to die of the virus here. Why? Because, according to his nephew, staff at the Dallas hospital where he was treated ""didn't even give him a chance."" ""Nobody tried to help Eric,"" Josephus Weeks said Friday night. ""... If they would have given him a chance, he would have fought his way through."" In an emotional interview with CNN's Erin Burnett, Weeks alleged that Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital officials ""said no to everything"" relatives requested and ""lied to us the whole time."" He also accused the hospital of giving Duncan inferior treatment because he was poor, had no health insurance and was black. ""Had (he) been another color, he probably would be living today, he would have survived it,"" he said. ""And that's what's really hurting me the most: ... They treated him the way they did because of the color of (his) skin. ""... You stand a chance if you're white, but not if you're black."" This wasn't the first time members of Duncan's camp have made such claims. Responding to these allegations, the hospital issued a statement Thursday defending its handling of the 42-year-old Liberian national's case. Its involvement started  September 25, when Duncan first came into its emergency room with a fever and was let go four hours later; resumed September 28, when an ambulance brought him back; and ended with his death Wednesday morning. During that first visit and again after his admission -- when more than 50 people cared for Duncan in a 24-bed intensive care unit set aside for his care -- the hospital said, ""Our care team provided Mr. Duncan with the same high level of attention and are that would be given any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care."" The hospital said: ""We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area."" In its Thursday statement, Texas Health Presbyterian addressed other criticisms as well. Why wasn't he immediately given an experimental drug? Because one wasn't available, the hospital explained. Why didn't he get a blood transfusion, like other Ebola patients in the United States? Because ""his blood type was not compatible with the serum donors."" 7 ways Thomas Eric Duncan's Ebola case differs from others in U.S. As to Duncan's condition the first time he went to Texas Health Presbyterian, the hospital said he had a ""low grade fever and abdominal pain,"" and was released with some antibiotics and a pain reliever. Weeks claims that discharge papers show that Duncan, in fact, had a 103-degree fever when he left the hospital. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Thursday -- as he and other officials have said previously -- that ""clearly there was a misstep early on when he wasn't diagnosed immediately"" in that first ER visit. There have been criticisms that hospital staff didn't process the fact Duncan had come from Liberia, where Ebola has infected and killed thousands. But Fauci said that blaming the hospital for Duncan's death is ""misplaced,"" even if it is ""understandable"" for a mourning family. ""I just can't believe that he was deliberately treated in a less well way than others,"" said Fauci. It seems no explanation, no justification, will wipe away Weeks' grief for a man he called ""my brother, my uncle, my best friend"" as a ""very good person' who would help anyone regardless of their skin color, their health condition or anything else. Wiping away tears, Weeks said that, while he's obviously upset at the Dallas hospital, he would be fine if Duncan could miraculously come back to life. ""(But) he's dead. There's nothing you can do,"" the nephew said. ""You can't bring him back ... I can't have him (back). I never will.""

"(CNN) -- Tennessee state officials slapped the Tennessee Valley Authority with $11.5 million in fines Monday for a massive coal sludge spill in December 2008. The state Department of Environment and Conservation imposed the penalties after determining that the billion-gallon spill violated state clean-water and solid waste disposal laws. In a statement announcing the fines, Environment Commissioner Jim Fyke called them an ""appropriate"" response ""to an unprecedented event."" TVA spokesman David Boruff said that the fine was expected and that the utility would not challenge it. The December 22, 2008, spill began when a dike collapsed at a retention pond at the TVA power plant in Kingston, about 35 miles west of Knoxville. The mixture of water and ash was enough to fill nearly 800 Olympic-sized swimming pools, spreading across more than 300 acres of land and fouling the adjacent Emory River. There were no deaths, but three homes were destroyed and about a dozen others damaged. The spill contained some toxic chemicals, such as arsenic, selenium, lead and radioactive materials like chromium and barium. But the TVA and the federal Environmental Protection Agency have reported that air and drinking water in the area were safe and that the levels of toxic substances in the spill did not exceed federal standards. About 60 percent of the 1.1 billion-gallon spill has been removed from the river in the first phase of cleanup, Boruff said. The entire operation may take another three to four years, he said. The TVA agreed to pay $40 million for economic development projects in Kingston in 2009 as part of a larger fund set up for cleanup efforts.","State says sludge spill violated water, waste laws .

"Washington (CNN) -- More than 100 people were arrested in front of the White House Saturday after gathering for an antiwar protest on the eighth anniversary of the Iraq war. About 1,000 people from various antiwar groups, including Veterans For Peace, Iraq Veterans Against War and Code Pink, marched around Lafayette Park to make three demands of the Obama administration: stop the war, expose the lies and free Bradley Manning. Manning is a 23-year-old Army private accused of leaking classified military and State Department documents to the whistle-blower site WikiLeaks. He has been held at Quantico military prison in Virginia for nearly eight months. Among those calling for Manning's release on Saturday was Daniel Ellsberg, a former Pentagon official whose unprecedented leak of thousands of classified documents -- dubbed the Pentagon Papers -- revealed that top American officials were actively concealing the unwinnable reality of the Vietnam War from the public. Ellsberg, who went to trial facing 115 years in prison for his leak, was one of the 113 people arrested at Saturday's otherwise peaceful rally on charges of ""disobeying an official order."" Police at the protest told CNN the arrests were made after protesters handcuffed themselves to the White House fence. The protesters were transported to a park service facility and served violation notices, the National Park Service said. Ellsberg planned to attend another rally in support of Manning outside the Quantico Marine Corps Base in Virginia on Sunday.

"There is no shortage of parties to blame for the frightening turn of events in Iraq over the past week. An incomplete list would include, above all, ISIS, the spearhead of a broader Sunni Arab revolt and the group famously rejected by the al Qaeda leadership as too violent and puritanical even for them. ISIS grew out of the former al Qaeda franchise in Iraq that worked so hard after the fall of Saddam Hussein to provoke the sectarian bloodbath that was eventually unleashed in full in 2006. Also high on the list of culprits would be Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki who rarely misses an opportunity to alienate Iraq's Sunni Arabs and frustrate openings for reconciliation between the country's various communities. Special mention must also go to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. His decision in 2011 to respond violently to the legitimate, peaceful and democratic demands of his people set off the civil war which provided ISIS with a new battleground just after Sunni Arabs in Iraq had turned against it. ISIS exploited this opening to the full, securing control over territory and oil reserves, and methodically building up its strength in preparation for a dramatic return to Iraq. Some of the greatest offenders, however, are to be found in the west, appearing in television studios or writing opinion pieces, offering their analysis of the situation and advice on what action their successors should take. Displaying an almost comical lack of self-awareness, George Bush's Vice President Dick Cheney, former U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair now deny their past actions had any bearing on the current crisis (or, in the case of Cheney, simply ignore their own record completely) while recommending renewed military engagement from the U.S. and UK. Responding to the shameless re-emergence of these ghosts from the past may seem like a futile exercise in score-settling, but in fact it is of vital current importance. The 2003 invasion was a war of choice, that Kofi Annan called ""illegal"" under international law, yet there remains no prospect of accountability for those responsible. That being the case, it is vital to ensure that the likes of Blair, Cheney et al are at least forced to pay a political cost for their actions, with the shame that attaches to them acting as a deterrent to any future leader tempted to emulate their record. The invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq helped lay the ground for the current crisis in a number of important respects. The occupying forces set the divisive tone early on, using sectarian quotas to select Iraqi politicians to sit on the Interim Governing Council that acted as the initial faÃ§ade to U.S. authority over ""liberated"" Iraq. The summary dismantling of the Iraqi state and army -- a measure still defended by Wolfowitz -- hit the Sunni community disproportionately, further alienating them from the post-Saddam settlement. Iraq's descent into a failed state provided conditions that ISIS, in its original incarnation, was able to exploit to the full. Of course, the presence of occupying western armies played directly into the al Qaeda narrative, acting as a magnet for jihadis from across the region and beyond. The horrific abuses uncovered at Abu Ghraib and the U.S. military's brutal military tactics -- for example in the devastating assaults on Falluja in 2004 -- were all gifts to jihadi recruiting sergeants, as was the continued support for the by now Shia-dominated Baghdad government as it ran death squads during the height of the civil war. The likes of Cheney, Wolfowitz and Blair, who oversaw all of this, are scarcely qualified to offer authoritative counsel on how to deal with the disastrous effects of their own actions. And even if it were not for their own record, their advice does not stand up on its own terms. Returning to Iraq with air strikes, or an extension of the extrajudicial execution program that the Obama administration has been running with its drone operations in Yemen and Pakistan, would serve only to inflame the situation further. What Iraq needs, above all, is a political solution whereby Sunni Arabs, who have no love for ISIS and who have turned decisively against it in the recent past, are given a full part in a government of national reconciliation, independent of compromising foreign interference and capable of reintegrating all Iraqi communities into the new dispensation. Air strikes in support of Maliki's rigid, sectarian regime will inevitably lead to major civilian loss of life, deepening divisions and making political reconciliation harder to achieve. International jihadis had no real presence in Iraq before the U.S.-led invasion of 2003. Now, in no small part due to the ironically titled ""war on terror"" waged by Cheney, Wolfowitz and Blair, those forces now exert joint control over a huge swathe of the country.

"It may be one of the most-quoted lines in American literature -- and if you dare to quote it, you might have to pay. In late October, Faulkner Literary Rights -- which represents Nobel Prize-winning author William Faulkner's estate -- sued representatives of Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" for misquoting the famous line, ""The past is never dead. It's not even past."" In the film, about a writer who travels back in time to 1920s Paris, Owen Wilson's character lightly rephrases the line as ""The past is not dead. Actually, it's not even past."" For the film's sin, Faulkner's estate is suing for copyright infringement and asking for ""damages, disgorgement of profits, costs and attorney fees,"" according to the suit. Defendant Sony Pictures Classics, which released ""Midnight in Paris,"" quickly fired back. Last living Faulkner talks about 'Pappy' ""This is a frivolous lawsuit and we are confident we will prevail in defending it,"" the studio said in a statement, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Sony is defending the quotation as a ""fair use"" under copyright law, which is a defense that lets others freely reproduce copyrighted works for purposes such as criticism, comment and news reporting. Woody Allen had no comment, his publicist told CNN. But Lee Caplin, executor of the Faulkner estate, believes the movie went over the line in its use of the quotation, which comes from Faulkner's 1950 work ""Requiem for a Nun."" He points out that ""Midnight in Paris"" is a commercial enterprise, the line was important to the film and Allen or Sony should have asked permission. Ron Howard asked and received permission (for a fee) from the estate to use a Faulkner quotation in a Howard-produced TV series, he says, and Sony or Allen could have easily done the same. ""I don't think Woody is any less knowledgeable than Ron Howard,"" says Caplin, a lawyer and movie producer. ""I think Woody's in the motion-picture business. It's called a business because you make a movie that sells tickets. ... When you attach Faulkner to your product, you're enhancing that product. You're enhancing it for artistic reasons, but you're mostly enhancing it for the entertaining business reasons of why you make a product more appealing."" Moreover, he adds, ""If Woody could have written something better, I'm sure he would have."" But Neville Johnson, an entertainment lawyer who specializes in copyright and fair use, thinks the Faulkner estate is grasping. The quote is short, for one thing -- nine words, a tiny fraction of ""Requiem for a Nun."" ""You're telling me one sentence gets you a copyright infringement action? I don't think so,"" he says. Caplin disagreed with that line of thinking. ""It puzzles me that people think size matters,"" he says. In addition, copyright infringement comes into play if it can damage the ""potential market"" of the original work. ""I guess the book will never sell another copy, don't you think?"" Johnson thundered mockingly. ""It's all over for Faulkner!"" Looking backward with the bard of Oxford . Of all the writers to be involved in a copyright infringement lawsuit, William Faulkner would seem one of the least likely. The bard of Oxford, Mississippi, is known for colorfully evocative novels about a murky post-Civil War Southern landscape, which -- though rewarding -- are often the kinds of books forced on unsuspecting high school students. His writing isn't exactly pithy: He's been listed in Guinness World Records for constructing a record-setting 1,288-word sentence (in ""Absalom, Absalom!""). Some of his best known works, such as ""The Sound and the Fury"" and ""Intruder in the Dust,"" are noted for their thickets of stream-of-consciousness storytelling. For many years, the Faux Faulkner Contest honored scribblers who attempted to reproduce the master's rhythmic prose, tormented Southern characters, and endless comma-strung clauses (with parenthetical asides). Faulkner was no stranger to Hollywood himself, signing a series of contracts in the '30s and '40s to write for various studios. He was credited with six screenplays, including the adaptations of Ernest Hemingway's ""To Have and Have Not"" and Raymond Chandler's ""The Big Sleep."" His love-hate relationship with the movies was parodied in the Coen brothers' film ""Barton Fink"" through the character of W.P. Mayhew, a hard-drinking Southerner hailed by the title character as ""the finest novelist of our time."" Touring the South's literary landmarks . Indeed, Faulkner is considered a titan of American literature, often evoked with Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald among a trio of pre-World War II greats. His words -- particularly the ones approximated in ""Midnight in Paris"" -- still echo, says Jay Watson, the Howry Chair of Faulkner Studies at (where else?) the University of Mississippi. ""It describes themes in American history, and I think that's one of the reasons why that line has had such resonance,"" he says. Faulkner's line is haunting and backward-looking, a warning that we forget our tangled roots at our peril -- a sentiment not often expressed in this country, he points out. ""As a culture, the U.S. is pretty forward-looking and youth-oriented,"" Watson says, ""and we very often tend to have a sharper eye on our future than on the past."" A 'very gray area' In a way, it's looking backward that's the nub of the lawsuit. Artists routinely stand on the shoulders of their predecessors, channeling ideas through their personal lenses. Done creatively, it can provide whole new meanings to the original source. Francis Ford Coppola used Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" as the basis for ""Apocalypse Now""; Conrad, in turn, relied on Dante's ""Inferno."" Faulkner's books, too, are full of references to other works, particularly the King James Bible and Shakespeare's plays (which are both in the public domain). ""He even said, at moments when he was asked to give advice to young writers, that there's an element of artistic creation that is glorified stealing,"" says Watson. ""In order to be bold and ambitious as an artist, you have to be willing to use whatever you find wherever you may find it."" Other artists have made frequent use of Faulkner. The Faulkner Institute at Southeast Missouri State University maintains a page of ""Faulkner sightings."" Of course, when done less than creatively, it provides openings for the attorneys -- and in our remix-happy society, full of self-produced videos and sampled music, there's a fine line between creativity and copyright infringement (or, for that matter, outright piracy). YouTube alone is full of ripped-off video files and audio tracks, says Johnson. ""It's a morass out there of violations across the board,"" he says. But it is sometimes hard to determine when the line is crossed. Artists and their estates have sued in the past when they believed their copyrights were being infringed upon. In 2001, Margaret Mitchell's estate sued author Alice Randall and publisher Houghton Mifflin over Randall's ""The Wind Done Gone,"" a parody of ""Gone With the Wind"" told from the point of view of a slave. That case was eventually settled out of court, though an appeals court had upheld Randall's right to create the book. Fair use is a ""very gray area,"" says Julie Ahrens, who runs the Fair Use Project at Stanford University's Center for Internet and Society. ""There are lots of things that are not clear."" ""I get things where people are like, 'Are you sure I can do this?' And the best I can say is, 'Yes, you should be able to,' "" she says. However, she doesn't see a problem with ""Midnight in Paris"" and ""the past is not dead."" Besides, the phrase has been used many times before -- in news headlines, TV shows and song lyrics. President Obama even used the line in perhaps the most famous speech of the 2008 campaign, known as ""A More Perfect Union,"" which he delivered in response to the controversy involving his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Obama's speech chronicled the challenges of race in America, and also misquoted Faulkner: ""The past isn't dead and buried. In fact, it isn't even past,"" Obama said. ""The idea that one person can control the use of those particular words seems ridiculous to me,"" says Ahrens. ""Any of kind of literary allusion is ordinarily celebrated. This seems to squarely fall in that tradition."" It seems like a lot of effort over a few words -- this case of the estate of a long-dead author going up against a multibillion-dollar Hollywood conglomerate. But the impact can be deep. Ahrens is worried about a chilling effect; Caplin is hoping that a brighter line can be introduced in the dim area of fair use. It's nothing personal, he adds. He loved ""Midnight in Paris."" As executor, he's just looking out for the fiduciary responsibilities of the Faulkner estate, and he's willing to let a jury decide the merits of the copyright case. ""I'd love to have Woody Allen come down and have a free tour of (Faulkner's house) Rowan Oak,"" he says. ""But if he wants to use any more of Mr. Faulkner, I would want him to give me a call and discuss a license fee.""","William Faulkner quotation subject of a lawsuit .

"In its ruling last week on the national health care law, the Supreme Court found that penalties the law places on people who don't buy health insurance count as a tax protected by the Constitution. The Obama administration had argued that the fees should be considered a penalty. But the government also argued that the individual mandate can be viewed as constitutional under Congress' powers of taxation. The high court rejected the ""penalty"" argument. ""The payment is not so high that there is really no choice but to buy health insurance; the payment is not limited to willful violations, as penalties for unlawful acts often are; and the payment is collected solely by the (Internal Revenue Service) through the normal means of taxation,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the decision. The court noted that the law calls for no other punishments for refusal to buy health insurance. ""Indeed, it is estimated that four million people each year will choose to pay the IRS rather than buy insurance,"" the decision said, citing figures from the Congressional Budget Office.  ""We would expect Congress to be troubled by that prospect if such conduct were unlawful."" What the ruling means to you . But on the taxation argument, the court agreed. The Constitution allows Congress to tax and spend, giving the federal government ""considerable influence even in areas where it cannot directly regulate,"" the decision said. The mandate ""looks like a tax in many respects,"" Roberts wrote. The money is to be paid by people when they file their tax returns and does not apply to those who pay no federal income taxes; the amount someone owes ""is determined by such familiar factors as taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing status,"" and the ""requirement to pay is found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by the IRS."" The high court overturned a unanimous decision by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the mandate did not impose a tax. The Supreme Court also ruled that it could proceed with considering the constitutionality of the tax despite the Anti-Injunction Act, which dates back 145 years. The law said lawsuits can't be used to prevent taxing, only to get refunded for taxes already paid. The high court said whether something is a tax for the purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act is Congress' decision -- and since Congress designated the mandate as including a penalty rather than a tax, the law did not apply in this case. ""It is up to Congress whether to apply the Anti-Injunction Act to any particular statute, so it makes sense to be guided by Congress's choice of label on that question. That choice does not, however, control whether an exaction is within Congress's constitutional power to tax."" The court emphasized that it was not weighing in on whether the mandate is a good idea. ""Because the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness,"" the decision said. How are you affected by the ruling?

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Not all of the earthquake-traumatized Haitians are receiving the aid they need, a U.S. general said Thursday, partly because displaced residents are moving from place to place. ""We're still not up to meeting the needs of the Haitian people as far as the amount of supplies that are there. And so, there have been some instances, isolated, where we've been out to give distribution to citizens, there hasn't always been enough food,"" said Air Force Gen. Douglas Fraser, head of the Miami-based U.S. Southern Command. He added: ""We haven't anticipated the demand, I guess, at each site as we've gone out because the Haitians have -- have migrated around, if you will, from distribution site to distribution site, so we're finding pockets that we haven't been able to get in to."" He said the distribution is inconsistent, however, because there are areas where fresh fruit and plenty of food are available. ""The need keeps moving around a little bit,"" Fraser said. ""That's an evolving issue."" iReport:  Haiti's missing and found | Full coverage . Another problem has been damage to the south pier of the port in Port-au-Prince, which is reducing the number of containers that can be unloaded there, Fraser said. The pier was damaged by new tremors on Wednesday. The U.N. World Food Programme will expand its distribution points in Port-au-Prince from 12 to 15 on Friday, the general said. There are hundreds of camps for displaced persons in the capital and surrounding areas following the devastating January 12 earthquake. Fraser said from 800,000 to about 1 million Haitians have lost their homes. He said there was tremendous support from the international community, and ""the relief efforts improve every day."" One of the most popular items distributed recently is hand-cranked radios. Fraser gave the report on the relief effort to Pentagon reporters via teleconference. He said one of the most pressing needs was a place for patients in recovery, and that problem was being worked on. Girl, 16, rescued in Haiti . When was asked how much the U.S. military effort was costing, he said he didn't know. ""I don't have an accurate assessment of the cost, primarily because it involves many parts of the Department of Defense,"" he said. He added President Obama and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates have said they will fund whatever he says is needed. However, there appeared to be a somewhat different message Wednesday from Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell. When he was asked how much the Haiti operation was costing, he seemed to indicate that cost is now becoming a factor. ""You know, I think we're still working that. But I mean, you know, we've got 24 ships out there. You've got 15,000 personnel. You've got flights. This is a -- this is a very expensive operation. ""We have committed enormous capabilities towards this mission, and the meter is running. And so I don't know that we've gotten arms quite yet around how much, but -- you know, probably hundreds of millions of dollars."" As the general was making his comments, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was discussing the enormity of the task of rebuilding Port-au-Prince, given the devastation. ""You have to have so many parts to coordinate,"" said Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, who chairs the committee. ""And you've got to come in there with a new city planning concept. You've got to have a vision for what you want this place to look like. ""I don't see any entity at this point or movement ... that suggests to me the global community is coming together around that organizational effort the way that it ought to,"" Kerry said. Paul Farmer, the United Nations deputy special envoy for Haiti, testified that he agreed. ""This task is so massive that we need the 'international A-Team' working on this case,"" Farmer said. Kerry said he believed the project could be pulled together to empower Haitians, and ""we're going to press this concept.""

"The mysteries surrounding the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, and the true identities of some of its passengers, are as deep as the southeast Asian waters where multinational search teams are searching for the jet. Navies from two of Malaysia's neighbors were pursuing new leads as Sunday turned into Monday in the region. Vietnam's navy has spotted a floating object about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Vietnam's Tho Chu Island, which is off the country's southwest coast in the Gulf of Thailand, Vietnam National Search and Rescue Committee spokesman Hung Nguyen told CNN. The object was spotted by a Vietnamese navy rescue aircraft at about 7:30 a.m. ET Sunday (6:30 p.m. local time). Because of the dark, the navy aircraft could not get close enough to identify the floating object and was recalled to base. Three search and rescue boats have since been deployed to that location. Meanwhile, Thailand's navy is shifting its focus in the search away from the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea, Thai Navy Rear Adm. Karn Dee-ubon told CNN on Sunday. The shift came at the request of the Malaysians, who are looking into possibilities the plane turned around and could have gone down in the Andaman Sea, near Thailand's border, Karn said. The Andaman Sea lies to the west of a narrow strip of Thailand that ends in the Malaysian Peninsula, while the Gulf of Thailand lies to the east of that Thai isthmus. One promising lead has turned out to be a dead end. A ""strange object"" spotted by a Singaporean search plane late Sunday afternoon is not debris from the missing jetliner, a U.S. official familiar with the issue told CNN on Sunday. A U.S. reconnaissance plane ""thought it saw something like debris, but it was a false alarm,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. By the end of the day Sunday, more than 40 planes and more than two dozen ships from several countries were involved in the search. Two reconnaissance aircraft from Australia and one plane and five sea vessels from Indonesia were the latest additions, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the director general of civil aviation in Malaysia, told reporters Sunday. In addition, the Chinese navy dispatched a frigate and an amphibious landing ship, according to an online post by China's navy. Those reinforcements join the rescue teams already scouring the South China Sea, near the Gulf of Thailand, for any sign of where the flight, operated by Malaysia's flagship airline, might have gone down, Malaysian authorities said. The area in focus for most of the search, about 90 miles south of Tho Chu Island, is where a Vietnamese plane reportedly spotted oil slicks that stretched between 6 and 9 miles. ""I can confirm that there was an oil slick, no debris. But what we are doing now, I was told that the Vietnamese aircrafts are on the site right now to verify what actually is it on the surface of those waters,"" said acting Malaysian Transportation Minister Hishammuddin bin Tun Hussein. Big questions far outweigh the few fragments of information that have emerged about the plane's disappearance: . What happened to the plane? Why was no distress signal issued? Who exactly was aboard? The flight may have changed course and turned back toward Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian military officials said at a news conference Sunday. But the pilot appears to have given no signal to authorities that he was turning around, the officials said, attributing the change of course to indications from radar data. As the search continues, the agonizing wait goes on for relatives of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board the plane. Video from Reuters showed Malaysia Airlines personnel in Beijing, where Flight 370 was headed, helping family members apply for expedited passports so they could fly to Kuala Lumpur early this week. Among the passengers, 154 people were from China or Taiwan; 38 Malaysians, five Indian nationals and three U.S. citizens. Five of the passengers were younger than 5 years old. Malaysia Airlines said Monday that initial financial assistance has been given out to all passengers' families ""over and above their basic needs."" Each family has also been assigned at least one caregiver. ""Malaysia Airlines' primary focus at this point in time is to care for the families. This means providing them with timely information, travel facilities, accommodation, meals, medical and emotional support,"" the airline said in a statement. Stolen passports . Interpol tweeted Sunday that it is ""examining additional suspect #passports in connection"" with the missing flight. Earlier, the international law enforcement agency said at least two passports -- one Austrian and one Italian -- recorded in its stolen and lost travel documents database were used by passengers onboard the flight. The passports were added to the database after being stolen in separate incidents over the past two years, Interpol said. Italy and Austria have said that none of their citizens were onboard the plane. ""No checks of the stolen Austrian and Italian passports were made by any country between the time they were entered into INTERPOL's database and the departure of flight MH 370. At this time, INTERPOL is therefore unable to determine on how many other occasions these passports were used to board flights or cross borders,"" the agency said in a Sunday statement. It added that passengers were able to board planes more than a billion times last year without having their passports screened by Interpol's databases. The Italian man whose passport was allegedly used, Luigi Maraldi, contacted the Italian consulate in Phuket, Thailand, on Saturday, after receiving a call from his parents, Italian Consul Franco Cavaliere told CNN on Sunday. Maraldi told Reuters he was inundated with phone calls, texts and social media inquiries asking if he was alive and well. He soon discovered that he was the subject of stories about the missing plane. Maraldi is staying on Phuket Island as a tourist, and his passport disappeared in July 2013, Cavaliere said. Maraldi told Reuters he got a new passport after his old one was stolen. ""Whilst it is too soon to speculate about any connection between these stolen passports and the missing plane, it is clearly of great concern that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in INTERPOL's databases,"" said Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble in a statement. The two passengers who used the passports in question appear to have bought their tickets together. The tickets were bought from China Southern Airlines at identical prices, paid in Thailand's baht currency, according to China's official e-ticket verification system Travelsky. The ticket numbers are contiguous, which indicates the tickets were issued together. The two tickets booked with China Southern Airlines both start in Kuala Lumpur, fly to Beijing, and then onward to Amsterdam. The Italian passport's ticket continues to Copenhagen, the Austrian's to Frankfurt. Authorities say they are investigating the identities of some of those onboard who appear to have issues with their passports. ""I've seen these reports about the passports. We're looking into that, but we don't have anything to confirm at this point,"" U.S. deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""The reports certainly raise questions and concerns, and that's exactly why we're looking into them. But right now, it would be premature to speculate,"" he said. Plane was 'at safest point' in flight . Terrorism concerns . A fuller picture of what happened may not become available until searchers find the plane and its flight data recorder. ""We have not been able to locate anything, see anything,"" Rahman told reporters Sunday. The passport mystery raised concerns about the possibility of terrorism, but officials cautioned that it was still too early to arrive at any conclusions. Malaysian authorities have been in contact with counterterrorism organizations about possible passport issues, acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Sunday. He didn't specify how many potential passport issues there were, saying authorities are looking at the whole passenger manifest. Additionally, no inquiry was made by Malaysia Airlines to determine if any passengers on the flight were traveling on stolen passports, he said. Many airlines do not check the database, he said. Five passengers ended up not boarding the aircraft. Their bags were removed and were not onboard the jet when it disappeared, Hussein said. A U.S. intelligence official said that no link to terrorism had been discovered so far, but that authorities were still investigating. Another possible explanation for the use of the stolen passports is illegal immigration. There are previous cases of illegal immigrants using fake passports to try to enter Western countries. And Southeast Asia is known to be a booming market for stolen passports. Disappearing during cruise . There is a precedent for a modern jetliner to fall from the sky while ""in the cruise"" and lie hidden for months, according to CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest. On June 1, 2009, Air France Flight 447 was en route from Rio De Janeiro to Paris when communications ended suddenly from the Airbus A330, another state-of-the-art aircraft. It took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of flight 447's wreckage and the majority of the 228 bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean. It took even longer to find the cause of the disaster. In May 2011, the aircraft's voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the ocean floor after an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles. It was not until July 2012 that investigators published their report, which blamed the crash on a series of errors by the pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems. The missing Malaysia Airlines plane had suffered damage in the past, airline CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said Sunday. The aircraft had a clipped wing tip, but Boeing repaired it, and the jet was safe to fly, Yahya said. The National Transportation Safety Board announced late Saturday that a team of its investigators was en route to Asia to help with the investigation, the agency said. If all those on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 are found to have died, it will rank as the deadliest airline disaster since November 12, 2001, when American Airlines Flight 587 crashed into a New York neighborhood, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground. The deadliest commercial air crash ever involving a single plane occurred almost 30 years ago on August 12, 1985, in the mountains of central Japan. A total of 520 people were killed when Japan Airlines Flight 123 -- a Boeing 747 -- crashed not long after takeoff from Tokyo. Four people survived.","Malaysia Airlines says financial assistance has been given to families .

"Pirot, Serbia (CNN) -- In the backroom of a small house in Pirot in southeastern Serbia, a handful of women are fighting to keep an ancient craft alive. Their dexterous fingers race up and down large wooden looms, weaving the bold geometric patterns distinct to Pirot carpets. Once celebrated throughout Europe for their beauty, Pirot carpets graced the walls and floors of Serbian royal palaces, as well homes of the urban elite. Weaved for over four centuries in the town after which they were named -- Pirot, once a thriving trade center on the caravan route between east and west -- they were ceremonially rolled out for state visits, and given to foreign dignitaries. However, what was a thriving craft practiced by 5,000 weavers a century ago is now under threat of extinction, with only 10 women still keeping the tradition going. ""Pirot carpet weaving is our treasure which is passed on from generation to generation. It's the knowledge I learned from my mother and my grandmother,"" says Slavica Ciric who founded the Lady's Heart cooperative in Pirot with local women in 2009, to try to stop the skills nurtured throughout centuries from passing into oblivion. ""Carpet weaving is in our DNA,"" she continues. ""We were born on carpets and we grew up in houses filled with Pirot carpets."" Mastery of craft . Pirot carpets are very thin but extremely dense, and are said to last more than a century. They have two identical sides and are geographically protected, which means that they can only be made in the Pirot area, and out of Pirot sheep -- a rare breed with only a few flocks counting just 250 sheep remaining. Weaving is painstaking work. It requires geometrical precision, supreme skill and creativity in equal measure. Everything is done by hand only, and in the same way as hundreds of years ago. It takes two weavers working simultaneously a month to create less than one square meter. Traditionally a female activity, young girls would start at the loom at the age of 10, practicing every day for five years to reach a level considered good enough. Their weaving skill had a great impact on their marriage prospects -- it was considered a measure of intelligence because of the knowledge of mathematics required to calculate the size and distribution of patterns. ""When you look at a carpet with an untrained eye, you can see beautiful colorful patterns, but we work out exactly how many of these patterns we can fit within a meter,"" says Ciric. ""We have to be visionaries and use logic to see where these patterns will stop, and where the border of the carpet will connect and finish,"" she adds. And if a weaver makes a mistake, the carpet is instantly pulled apart, even if the work was nearly completed. Magical meaning . The concentration necessary for this kind of precise work often means that once a weaver sits down at the loom, she loses all sense of time. ""The pattern in a mysterious way simply possesses her, drags her into the depth and she's so taken by her work that everything around her stops. She forgets about the time, she surrenders herself to the pattern,"" says Ciric. And it's those patterns that give Pirot carpets a mystical allure. Weavers say they represent ancient symbols which carry magical meanings and can be read as an image alphabet, and there are 95 varieties which weavers have to memorize. ""It is very mysterious but in every single carpet there is a story which you can read. When I see a carpet I can immediately tell whether it has been made now or in a different period, whether it has been made with love or only to be sold,"" says Ciric. Even though this skill is now practiced only by a handful of women, Ciric and her fellow weavers from Lady's Heart are trying to pass it on to the next generation, organizing winter courses for schoolchildren, including boys. ""There is a new generation coming along and if we manage to pass on this knowledge to them, I think there won't be any danger of this craft dying out,"" says Ciric. ""We are the guardians of the tradition of Pirot carpet weaving, and we do this with love."" Read this: Resilient Belgrade rebuilds once again . Read this: No battery? Use a 'Strawberry Tree!'

"China sent fighter jets into its newly claimed -- and hotly disputed -- air defense zone above the East China Sea on Thursday, the same day that Japan's military firmly insisted its own patrols over the area wouldn't stop because of Beijing's declaration. The People's Liberation Army Air Force flew warplanes, including Su-30 and J-11 aircraft, into the ""air defense identification zone"" that Beijing announced last week, air force spokesman Col. Shen Jinke said. A KJ-2000 -- an airborne radar early warning system -- also took flight. The Russian-developed Su-30 is a two-seat aircraft described by its manufacturer as ""a highly maneuverable fighter"" capable of hitting ground and sea-surface targets. The Chinese-made J-11 is a single-seat fighter also capable of ground attacks. The fighter jets conducted ""routine air patrols ... aiming to strengthen monitoring on air targets in the zone and fulfill the air force's historic mission,"" Shen said in a statement posted on the Chinese defense ministry's website. Jinke portrayed the mission as a ""defensive measure ... in line with international practices."" China's military has been on ""high alert,"" he added, and is prepared to act ""based on different air threats to firmly ensure air-defense safety."" What comes of Beijing's latest foray over its controversial newly created zone remained to be determined early Friday. Still, some of its previous actions -- including the declaration itself -- have been met with staunch resistance by Japan and its longtime ally, the United States. On Thursday, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said his nation's Self Defense Force has used ships and planes to patrol and conduct surveillance in the East China Sea since before China claimed the air defense zone that covers much of the sea. And they wouldn't stop, he insisted. ""We have no intention to change this operation in consideration for China,"" Suga told reporters. ""... We will continue the surveillance/patrol operation with strong determination to protect our territory against China's one-sided attempt to change the status quo by force."" Japan isn't alone in disobeying China, which has warned military measures could be taken if planes entering the zone fail to identify themselves and submit flight planes to Chinese authorities. Two unarmed U.S. B-52 bombers recently flew through the area in what the U.S. State Department characterized as a planned military exercise. War of words . China has grown more assertive beyond its recognized borders since Chinese President Xi Jinping took office about a year ago -- creating a delicate situation for Washington, which has  promised to focus more on Asia and uphold commitments to its allies in the region. ""Unlike his predecessors, Xi is making foreign policy with the mindset of a great power, increasingly probing U.S. commitments to its allies in the region and exploiting opportunities to change the status quo,"" Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, director of Asia-Pacific programs at the U.S. Institute of Peace, wrote in a commentary for CNN.com this week . The United States and Japan have criticized Beijing's air defense announcement, saying it escalates tensions in the region and raises the risk of an incident. They say they won't recognize the new zone. China hit back at those comments with strong words of its own, describing the U.S. and Japanese statements as unreasonable and unacceptable. After news of the U.S. flights emerged, the Chinese Defense Ministry responded cautiously Wednesday, saying it had monitored the planes' activity on the edge of the air defense zone. The statement held back from criticizing the U.S. action. At a regular briefing later Wednesday, a journalist asked a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman if Beijing is concerned it will now be seen as a ""paper tiger."" ""I want to emphasize that the Chinese government has enough resolution and capability to safeguard the country's sovereignty and security,"" replied the spokesman, Qin Gang. Simmering dispute . The bomber flights are the strongest American involvement yet in a festering territorial dispute in the region between China and Japan over a set of small, uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. After China's air defense declaration Saturday, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reiterated American support for Japan, where thousands of U.S. troops are stationed as part of a security agreement. He said the U.S. Japan Mutual Defense Treaty applies to the disputed islands, known as Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China. Uneasy encounters between Chinese and Japanese planes and ships have already taken place repeatedly over the past year near the islands, which are believed to have large oil reserves nearby. Tensions spiked after the Japanese government purchased some of the islands from a private owner in September 2012, angering Chinese authorities, who saw the move as an attempt by Japan to tighten control. Hagel warned that China's ""unilateral action"" of declaring the air defense zone ""increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations."" Amid the tensions, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden will visit the region next week on a previously announced trip, stopping in Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul, South Korea. Why China's new air zone incensed Japan, U.S. Difficult to monitor . Monday's U.S. bomber flights also highlight the challenges that analysts say China faces in policing its newly claimed air zone. In its statement Wednesday, the Chinese Defense Ministry said that ""China has the capability to exercise effective control"" over the area. ""Beijing might have bitten off a bit more than they can chew because actually going out and monitoring these things on an ongoing basis is probably a bit beyond the capabilities of the Chinese air force right now,"" said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of FlightGlobal, an aviation and aerospace industry website. ""In a sense, it's more a rhetorical statement, as opposed to a realistic military space,"" he said. Adding to the complications and confusion surrounding the zone, Japan's two main commercial airlines said Wednesday that following a request from the Japanese government, they and other members of the Scheduled Airlines Association of Japan will not submit flight plans to Chinese authorities for flights through the zone claimed by Beijing. The two carriers, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, said the association had concluded that there would be ""no impact"" on the safety of passengers on board flights through the zone without the submission of flight plans to China. But Waldron said he wasn't entirely sure about that. From a legal point of view, he said, the airlines probably don't have to report their plans and follow all the rules requested by China. ""I think from a safety perspective, it's a good idea for them to do so,"" he said. ""Just in case."" 'The right of every country' Since it declared the new air defense zone over the weekend, China has been busy making its case for why it feels the move was justified. It has pointed out that other countries already operate air defense identification zones in waters around their territory, noting that Japan has had a zone in place in the East China Sea since the 1960s. ""It's natural, it's indeed the right of every country to defend its airspace and also to make sure that its territorial integrity, its sovereignty are safeguarded,"" China's U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi said Tuesday. But analysts say that by declaring a zone that now overlaps with that of Japan, China has increased the likelihood of a high-risk incident in the air.

"(CNN)Chicago's historic Pullman District, a World War II internment camp and a section of Colorado's upper Arkansas River Valley will become the nation's newest national monuments this week, a White House official told CNN. President Barack Obama plans to make the announcement Thursday during a visit to Chicago's Pullman town, a historic industrial site that will become the first National Park Service unit in the city, the official said. Obama is naming the sites using his authority under the Antiquities Act, which he has already used to establish or expand 16 national monuments. Since 1906, presidents have used the act to protect other historic and natural sites across the country, including the Grand Canyon and the Statue of Liberty. Pullman National Monument, Illinois . America's first planned industrial town, the 203-acre site within the present-day city of Chicago has factories and buildings from the Pullman Palace Car Co., a railway car company dating to 1867. The company town was established in the 1880s. A majority white work force constructed the famous railway cars, while a mostly black work force from the ranks of former slaves worked in service positions on the cars. Key to the rise of an African-American middle class, the porters made labor history by organizing as the Brotherhood of the Sleeping Car Porters and eventually winning a historic labor agreement. ""Pullman workers fought for fair labor conditions in the late 19th century, and the Pullman porters helped advance America's civil rights movement,"" said Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois. ""During the economic depression of the 1890s, the Pullman community was the catalyst for the first industry-wide strike in the United States, which helped lead to the creation of Labor Day as a national day."" Honouliuli National Monument, Hawaii . Not far from Pearl Harbor, the Honouliuli Internment Camp opened in 1943 and was the longest-used and largest site for holding Japanese-Americans, European-Americans and resident immigrants in Hawaii. The internment camp, which once held captive 400 civilian internees and 4,000 prisoners of war, will be managed by the National Park Service. ""Honouliuli represents a dark period in our history when thousands of Japanese-Americans in Hawai'i and across the country were forced into internment camps during World War II,"" Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said in a statement. ""This historic site will memorialize the strength and bravery of the many Japanese-Americans who faced discrimination and serve as a reminder to ourselves and future generations that we cannot repeat the mistakes of the past."" Browns Canyon National Monument, Colorado . Located in the upper Arkansas River Valley near the town of Salida, this 21,000-acre monument will protect the bighorn sheep, bald eagles and amazing diversity of wildlife and plants that inhabit the mountains and cliffs of Browns Canyon. The designation will support outdoor human activity such as hiking, hunting and fishing, protect the watershed and keep in place existing water rights and uses. The site will be managed by the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management and Department of Agriculture's National Forest Service. ""Browns Canyon is a national treasure with a long history of bipartisan support in Colorado,"" said Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colorado, adding that the monument will stand as a tribute to former Sen. Mark Udall's legacy of protecting this and other Colorado sites. However, Gardner stated his preference to work through the legislative process. ""In the coming days I will be introducing legislation to ensure that Colorado's state and local interests have a seat at the table in discussions about Browns Canyon.""","Obama will name a Japanese internment camp a national monument .

"Multiple tornadoes pummeled a region in northeast Nebraska Monday, killing one and causing damage that was still being assessed as the sun went down. And the severe weather is not letting up. A tornado watch remains in place until early Tuesday morning. One city, Pilger, has been closed to all but emergency personnel, the state's emergency management agency said Monday night. Severe weather in the area caused damage in at least four towns -- Pilger, Wisner, Stanton and Pender, according to the governor's office. Are you there? Share your photos and videos if it is safe . At least 15 patients were transported to Faith Regional Health Services for treatment, and ""many more"" were expected to arrive, hospital spokeswoman Jacque Genovese said.

""We're still digging people out,"" said Sanford Goshorn, the emergency manager in Stanton County, where Pilger and Stanton are located. Wisner is in Cuming County, and Pender in Thurston County. In the immediate aftermath of the tornadoes, it was unclear how many touched down in this corner of Nebraska. But at least two major tornadoes touched down at the same time, CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers said. The two tornadoes -- side by side and straddling a road -- were a menacing sight. The state emergency management agency reported ""severe damage"" across the affected counties. ""We are still in a response mode in these communities,"" emergency management operations officer Earl Imler said. ""We are collecting damage reports from local officials on the ground."" Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman issued a state of emergency, putting the National Guard on standby. According to the governor's office, the reported fatality happened when a tornado picked up a car and dropped it. The National Weather Service also issued a tornado emergency warning for the town of Burwell, located in Garfield County, where a confirmed ""large, violent and extremely dangerous tornado"" was sighted. The storm included hail and residents in its path were urged to take immediate cover. Damage from the storm also reached the area of the Nebraska-Iowa border. ""We've had reports of brief touchdowns as the storms near Sioux City, Iowa,"" said National Weather Service Meteorologist Todd Heitkamp said.

"(CNN)Danyeil Durrant was 10 years old when she first began dieting. She had no idea she would be wrestling with her eating habits for the next three decades. In 2012, after years of alternating between dieting and splurging, Durrant had gone from ""chubby little girl"" to a morbidly obese woman. The 5-foot-2 paralegal from Sebastian, Florida, weighed 363 pounds. She had quit going to amusement parks and concerts because she couldn't fit in the seats or walk without knee pain, and she couldn't get in her car without losing her breath. On airplanes, she had to fly first class and still use a seat belt extender because she was too big for coach seats. She took showers because she couldn't lift her body out of the bathtub anymore. Durrant's doctor told her that her cholesterol was so bad ""that I was going to have a heart attack within 10 years if I didn't change my ways."" Besides the physical toll, her self-worth was shot. ""I spent 30 years of my life thinking that if I could just lose this weight, then my life could begin, then I'd make the cheerleading squad, then I could take that vacation, then I would meet the man of my dreams, etc.,"" said Durrant. ""I never felt like I was enough."" Durrant, now 41, attributes much of her weight gain to dieting at such a young age. ""It taught me that deprivation was the only way to lose weight, and that food was bad,"" she said. ""I thought I was fatter than I actually was, and I never developed (a healthy) self-esteem."" She felt helpless, knowing her life was at risk but not knowing how to change. August 3, 2012, marked the start of her new life. That night, she was at a dinner for her sister's birthday, ""pigging out on the fattiest foods possible,"" when her sister mentioned she had joined Weight Watchers and was having success with it. Durrant joined Weight Watchers the next morning with her best friend and never looked back. Through the company's points system, she learned how to create a balanced meal. She found the system wasn't as restrictive as many other diets and allowed her to enjoy foods like steak as long as they were eaten in moderation. Durrant stopped eating fast food and gave up soda. She began to appreciate -- and eventually, to love -- fruits and vegetables. Most importantly, she eliminated a lot of guilt by realizing that eating something unhealthy didn't equal failure. ""In the past, if I ate what I considered non-diet food, I thought I had ruined everything, and I would quit whatever diet I was on,"" Durrant said. ""Now I know that I can still occasionally splurge, attend celebrations, go to restaurants ... because I have learned how to choose something healthy anywhere I go."" She would go on to lose 150 pounds. In the first couple of months, Durrant's low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol dropped 37 points as she made more positive changes to her eating habits and began to spend more time in the gym. This health change was a major landmark in preventing the heart attack that her doctor had presented as a very real threat. But Durrant was not done making changes. From the very beginning, becoming physically strong was just as important to Durrant as losing a lot of weight. In January 2014, she made a New Year's resolution to go to the gym every day for a year. She has stayed faithful so far. ""Even if I'm out of town I make sure to go before I leave or I rush back to get in my workout before midnight,"" she said. ""I feel unstoppable."" Durrant has fitness equipment at home that she uses as well: a punching bag, an ab lounger, hand weights, kettlebells and workout DVDs. She tries to get in about five miles of cardio every day, as well as upper and lower body weight exercises. She has recently discovered a passion for weightlifting and bench pressing. ""I am very proud of my muscles,"" she said. ""I stare at them all the time."" Durrant's boyfriend, Joe Goshen, has been her biggest cheerleader. He said she's always been beautiful, but she ""now has a million different smiles, each one more beautiful than the last."" She weighs 213 pounds and is down to a size 12. Her ultimate goal is to weigh ""150 pounds of muscle."" Although Durrant has changed most dramatically on the outside, she likes to acknowledge the internal changes as well. ""I am not afraid of what people think of me. I am not afraid of social situations,"" she said. ""Basically, I am not afraid."" She said her newfound self-confidence has really helped her focus on the importance of even the smallest moment. ""When the weekend comes, I'm up with the birds and ready to get out of the house and make every moment count, instead of lying in bed with no energy, watching TV and eating."" Durrant decided to create a Facebook page called ""Get Down with Dani"" to both inspire others and to keep herself accountable for achieving her weight loss goals. ""I have had the pleasure of meeting the strongest people that I've ever known,"" she said. ""They have embraced me every step of my journey and allowed me to inspire and motivate them to start their own weight loss journeys."" Initially, Durrant said she challenged her followers to work out with her every day for a month, and more than 300 people joined her in accomplishing that goal. ""Now I have a challenge group with thousands of women, and a few good men, who are all 'Down with Dani' and excited for every new challenge that I give them,"" she said. ""We have made weight loss fun."" She said it's an amazing feeling to be the one doing the inspiring and motivating, when two years ago, ""all I wanted to do was hide in a corner and cry."" ""My struggle with obesity is the one thing in life that I always failed at,"" she said. ""To become an inspiration at your greatest failure, that is priceless.""","Danyeil Durrant started to lose weight to prevent a heart attack .

"As the rest of the world rang in 2012, Nigerians awoke to an unpleasant New Year's Day surprise: Their government announced the removal of a longstanding fuel subsidy that had helped to hold down gas prices in the largely impoverished country. Almost overnight, the price of fuel more than doubled, plunging the West African nation into mass unrest and bringing commerce to a standstill. Nigerians took to the streets on January 3 in protest against the removal of the fuel subsidy, and alleged corruption in the government of President Goodluck Jonathan. The demonstrations swelled a week later, with the backing of several major Nigerian labor unions. Goodluck Jonathan: Nigeria's embattled president . As protests spread to every major Nigerian city, CNN iReporters helped chronicle the unfolding events by telling their stories. In the days after the unrest began, Nigerians observing and participating in the street demonstrations submitted more than 500 iReports. Their pictures and videos gave CNN a firsthand look at protesters massing in large street gatherings, often holding signs expressing anger at their government. Another ubiquitous sight was the piles of burning refuse demonstrators used to shut down street traffic. iReporters on the frontline of protests also played a major role in CNN's coverage of last year's Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street movements. Now, with the protests formally ended but Nigeria reeling from a string of deadly bombing attacks by militant Islamist group Boko Haram, Nigerian iReporters said they wonder what the future will hold for their beleaguered country. ""Hopefully, the protests and conversations are beginning of the 'real' awakening of Nigerians,"" said Aminat Mohammed, 31, of Boston. A Nigerian citizen by birth, she was in Lagos for a business trip and decided to join the rallies against the sudden increase in fuel prices. ""The younger generation is itching for change and willing to demand better."" Mohammed and other iReporters said the mass eruption of protests helped raise awareness among Nigerians of their shared frustrations with the country's overburdened infrastructure and lack of social services. She said she believes protesters were ultimately failed by the trade unions' compromise with the government, which saw the formal end of the nationwide strike. CNN Photos: Putting a face on Nigeria's ""paradise lost"" Still, Mohammed said she remains optimistic that these protests have sparked a larger movement for democratic change in the country. That's a sentiment echoed by other Nigerian iReporters, who also expressed frustration over the compromise that saw the partial reinstatement of the country's fuel subsidy. And like Mohammed, they said they view the recent wave of protests as a turning point in their nation's history. ""The protests also served as one united platform for all types of Nigerians,"" said pharmacist Tai-osagbemi Boma, 24, of Ibadan. ""At a time where the country is much divided and (fractured) by sectarian and religious unrest, it also sent a message to the government that the people know their rights and are ready to fight for them."" Boma said he hopes that his children will someday see a more democratic Nigeria and that he'll be able to tell them about the time he went into the streets to protest. But the country faces many obstacles in the near future, not the least of which are the recent bombings by Boko Haram. Aliyu Abba Hikima, 27, said he believes the recent protests and violence may end up uniting two of the country's most fractious factions: Muslims and Christians. During the demonstrations he witnessed in Kano, ""People wept when they saw the Christians guarding the Muslims as they prayed, and vice versa,"" Hikima said. ""We believe it is a tremendous steppingstone for Nigerians to unite against their oppressor. ""The protest has also instilled in the heart of uneducated Nigerians the attitude of seeking of political and economic information of the state of the affairs of their country."" Most Nigerian iReporters expressed the shared hope their country is moving in the right direction, slowly but surely. ""It's safe to say that Nigeria is on the right path once again, even if the journey is still slow and seemingly boring,"" said freelance journalist Eromo Egbejule, 21, of Lagos. ""The protests have kick-started the national consciousness and revitalized the Nigerian spirit of never say never. Bigger things are coming. As a Nigerian proverb goes, 'A clap begins the dance.'

"(CNN) -- The fate of 29 New Zealand coal miners and contractors remains a mystery more than 20 hours since they were last above ground, with rescuers awaiting word that conditions are safe to go after the trapped men. An explosion rocked the Pike River mine, on New Zealand's west coast between Greymouth and Reefton, around 4 p.m. Friday New Zealand time. Two men walked out with minor injuries, but their colleagues -- ages 17 to 62 -- were trapped as much as 2.2 kilometers (1.4 miles) from the tunnel's opening and have not been heard from since. For now, authorities are monitoring results from a series of tests to determine if the air-quality underground is safe enough to send in help. The four tests conducted thus far, focusing on carbon monoxide levels, have been ""inconclusive,"" said Pike River Coal CEO Peter Whittall at a Saturday afternoon press conference. The rescuers are miners themselves, according to Gary Knowles, superintendent of the Tasman Police District, who is heading the rescue effort. For now, they are conducting drills and ready to go in at a moment's notice. ""Safety is paramount for me,"" said Knowles. ""When the opportunity arises, they'll be ready to go. They want to save their colleagues."" The miners' families, meanwhile, are at a Red Cross hall in Greymouth, about an hour from the site, where they're getting updates from the mine company and emergency rescue personnel. Whittall said the relatives are away from the mine site, near the town of Atarau about 90 miles northwest of Christchurch, because ""it doesn't add any value to the rescue operation and it doesn't add value to them, either."" Right now, they are mostly left to wait. ""There's 29 men down there. And there's 29 families. And there's 29 different sets of circumstances,"" said Whittall. ""And all of them are dealing with it in their own way."" The two survivors, one of whom has a brother trapped underground and whose father is the mine's safety manager, spent Friday night in a local hospital after suffering moderate blast injuries before being released Saturday. They both have talked to authorities, who still don't know what caused the explosion or the current condition of the mine. There are drinking water sources underground, said Whittall, and the workers likely brought some food with them. Although no contact has been made, officials are hopeful the trapped men found refuge near a ventilation shaft and might be getting fresh air from a broken compressor pipe. The situation in New Zealand is different from Chile, where rescuers successfully freed 33 men stuck underground in a copper and gold mine for 69 days. There are two routes out of the mine, Whittall said. Unlike the Chilean mine, where 33 miners were rescued in mid-October, the Pike River mine has steep terrain, and the shafts run horizontally into the hill, not vertically into the ground. ""This is not Chile. It's a whole different type of mine,"" said Knowles. Still, like in Chile, government and rescue authorities said they've been getting offers of help from around the region and the world. Gas testing equipment has been flown in from Australia to help with the rescue operation, with engineering and health experts ready to assist. A Facebook page devoted to the rescue effort had attracted over 9,500 supporters by Saturday afternoon from people wishing the miners well, offering prayers and asking for information. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, who spoke briefly at the end of Saturday's press conference, said that he's received offers of help from many groups and people, including an e-mail from Prince William that his heart went out to the miners. ""From the government's perspective, we're doing everything we can to make sure these 29 brave men are taken out of the mine,"" said Key. ""It's a difficult time for everyone.""","Rescuers are waiting on air-quality safety tests to go after trapped miners .

"Frightening government overreach or valuable law enforcement tool? That's the question politicians in Washington, and millions of citizens around the United States, asked Thursday thanks to a jolting report suggesting the government has been collecting millions of Americans' phone records. FBI Direct Robert Mueller will be asked about the matter -- revealed after a British newspaper, the Guardian, published a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court order that applied to phone data from Verizon -- when he appears next week before the House Judiciary Committee. The panel's chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, issued a statement Thursday saying he was ""very concerned that the Department of Justice may have abused the intent of the law, and we will investigate."" Reports: U.S. spy agencies mined Internet data . The report will also be the subject of an upcoming classified briefing by Attorney General Eric Holder to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Its chairman, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, is calling for a similar closed-door briefing for the entire U.S. Senate. When she read the news Thursday morning, the Maryland Democrat said, ""It was like, 'Oh, God, not one more thing ... where we're trying to protect America and then it looks like we're spying.'"" What does the Verizon order mean for me? An author of the Patriot Act -- the legislation used to justify the program -- added he is ""extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act."" ""These reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure,"" Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, wrote in a letter to Holder. But not everyone in the nation's capital is outraged or even concerned. Some say the real travesty would be if the program, which they describe as valuable, is halted. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the Guardian story refers to a ""three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years"" -- so that while the uproar may be new, the program is not. In that time, it's helped to disrupt ""terrorist plots"" on U.S. soil, she said. ""It is lawful,"" the California Democrat insisted. ""It has been briefed by Congress."" Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Michigan) and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Maryland), two key members of the House Intelligence Committee, both stressed that ""this important collection tool does not allow the government to eavesdrop"" and that it is routinely reviewed by Congress. White House spokesman Josh Earnest also made those points, adding President Barack Obama ""put in place a stronger regime of oversight"" when he took office. He further stressed the importance of ensuring ""we have the tools we need to confront the threat posted by terrorists (and to) protect the homeland."" ""That is his top priority,"" Earnest said of domestic security. ""But ... we need to balance that priority with the need to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights of American people. And that is the subject of a worthy debate."" What's been happening, and for how long? In 2006, it was reported the National Security Agency was secretly collecting telephone records in an effort to root out terror plots. ""Verizon's wireless and wireline companies did not provide to NSA customer records or call data, local or otherwise,"" the company said at the time. Like the FBI and the NSA, Verizon declined comment to the media Thursday on the Guardian report.  But company Vice President Randy Milch, in a note to employees, did say the newspaper's story may spur the company to respond in defiance of a promise of secrecy. The newspaper published the four-page, top-secret government order requiring ""originating and terminating"" phone numbers plus the location, time and duration of calls from the communications giant. It lets the FBI and NSA to obtain the records from April 25 to July 19. 7 things to know . The order applies to Verizon Business Network Services, an operation not described on the company's website. Its scope was not immediately clear, though the Guardian claimed ""millions of U.S. customers of Verizon"" were affected by the collection of information ""regardless of whether they are suspected of wrongdoing."" In his letter to Verizon employees, Milch said that his company would not provide the contents of any communications ""or the name, address or financial information of a subscriber or customer."" An Obama administration official said any such order would relate ""exclusively to metadata, such as a telephone number or the length of a call."" This kind of information ""allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities,"" the unnamed official said in a statement to media. Controversy over the Guardian report comes as the White House fends off privacy complaints on other fronts as well. The administration is under fire following revelations the Justice Department seized two months of phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors -- something done as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information. Plus, the Washington Post and the Guardian reported that U.S. intelligence has a broad secret data mining program that allows access to central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies -- among them Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook and Apple -- to extract e-mail, photos and other private consumer communications. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper challenged the Post and Guardian reports in a statement Thursday night, saying ""they contain numerous inaccuracies."" Specifically, he emphasized the section of the law tied to that reported program ""cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person or anyone located within the United States."" In statements on that and reports about collecting phone data, Clapper also called out those behind the apparent leaks -- saying it ""will have an impact on the behavior of our adversaries and make it more difficult for us to understand their intentions."" Speaking specifically about collecting personal phone records, privacy advocates called the practice perilous and claimed it gives  authorities access to information of many Americans who aren't terrorists. In fact, they might not necessarily be Verizon customers, and similar orders might also apply to other telecommunications companies. ""There is no indication that this order to Verizon was unique or novel,"" said the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fights to protect privacy. ""It is very likely that business records orders like this exist for every major American telecommunication company, meaning that, if you make calls in the United States, the NSA has those records. And this has been going on for at least seven years, and probably longer."" Opinion: NSA's phone snooping a different kind of creepy . Al Gore: 'Secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous' This group is hardly alone. The American Civil Liberties Union called it ""beyond Orwellian (in allowing) basic democratic rights (to be) surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies."" The Center for Constitutional Rights blasted it as ""the broadest surveillance order to ever had been issued: It requires no level of suspicion."" Many in President Barack Obama's own party spoke forcefully against it as well. Three Democratic representatives  -- John Conyers of Michigan, Jerrold Nadler of New York and Robert Scott of Virginia -- said the program is ""highly problematic and reveals serious flaws in the scope and application of the"" Patriot Act. ""(The revelations) confirm our fears -- that the law would be distorted to allow for ongoing, indiscriminate collection of data,"" they wrote. Sen. Mark Udall, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, described the program as ""the kind of government overreach I've said Americans would find shocking."" One of them: former Vice President Al Gore. ""Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?"" the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee wrote on Twitter. Senator says ending program would be 'catastrophic' Opinions were also strong on the other side of the debate. ""Terrorists will come after us if they can, and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us,"" said Feinstein. Her intelligence committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, concurred in stating the program has let authorities gather ""significant information on bad guys and only on bad guys over the years."" Former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes, a CNN contributor, said that if a phone number comes up that's linked to someone suspicious, they can go back and get information tied to that number. ""It's not that someone or some group of analysts can sit there and monitor 50 million phone calls going through the computers,"" Fuentes explained on CNN's ""Starting Point."" ""But it would create the ability to go back and see if you could connect phone calls."" Rep. Lindsey Graham said that, as a Verizon customer, ""it doesn't bother me one bit for the National Security Administration to have my phone number.""

"(CNN)After an incredibly busy 2014, during which health stories like Ebola, new food nutrition label rules, and the debate about the right to die sparked by Brittany Maynard dominated the headlines, it's now worth looking at what we may be covering in the next 12 months. So, in no particular order, here's my take on the nine big health stories to watch for, and the questions they will likely raise, in 2015. Doctor shortage. There aren't nearly enough of us to care for the U.S. population. By some estimates, the country is already short of tens of thousands of doctors, a problem that will only get worse as the demand for care increases with our aging population.  That could mean longer wait times for you when you need to make an appointment. But that also means policy makers will have to consider questions like: Is there a way to increase the number of residency training slots?  Are there other health care professionals who can reasonably fill in the gaps? Will the nation's quality of care go down?  How can the country avoid a situation where only the wealthy will be able to afford quality care? Hospital errors and infections. Hospital mistakes and infections are still one of the leading causes of preventable death (indeed, some studies suggest ""hospital-acquired conditions"" kill more people than car accidents or diabetes). True, a recent study showed the rate did get better this year, saving tens of thousands of lives. But what else can hospitals do to prevent these mistakes and infections?  Can technology like e-prescriptions and electronic health records prevent problems that most often occur: the mistakes caregivers make with a patient's drugs? Antibiotic resistance. It has been called public health's ""ticking time bomb."" The World Health Organization calls antibiotic resistant infections one of the biggest threats to global health today. Each year, at least 2 million people become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 people die each year.   Most of these deaths happen in health care settings and in nursing homes. How can we respond? Well, research teams around the world have already started searching for the next generation of infection-fighting drugs. But it remains to be seen if time will run out, sending us back to the beginning: a time before antibiotics, where even a cut that becomes infected could kill you. More do-it-yourself health care: apps and technology. Technology has made do-it-yourself patient care much easier.  This goes beyond just a patient's ability to look up their symptoms online.  There are apps to help with autism, apps that can simulate a check-up, apps that can monitor conditions. Wearables can motivate you to walk more or sleep more or check a diabetic's glucose level. But how does all this helping yourself make your health care better?   How much is too much? And what does this mean for your privacy? After all, the health care industry accounted for 43% of all major data breaches in 2013. Meanwhile, although 93% of health care data requires protection by law, some surveys suggest only 57% of it is ""somewhat protected."" What could this mean for your privacy and personal information if security doesn't get better? Food deserts. While not everyone agrees with the term food desert, the USDA still estimates 23.5 million people live in these urban neighborhoods and rural towns with limited access to fresh, affordable, healthy food.  Without grocery stores in these areas, residents often have to rely on fast food and convenience stores that don't stock fresh produce. It takes a real toll on their health. Families who live in these areas struggle more with obesity and chronic conditions, and they even die sooner than people who live in neighborhoods with easy access to healthy food.  More farmers markets are now accepting food stamps and many nonprofits have stepped in to try to bring community gardens and healthy food trucks to these areas, but so far it's not enough.  Will cities offer incentives to grocery store chains to relocate to these neighborhoods?  How else can this system be helped? Caregivers for the aging population. We are heading into a kind of caregiver crisis.  The number of people 65 years and older is expected to rise 101% between 2000 and 2030, yet the number of family members who can provide care for these older adults is only expected to rise 25%. This raises a series of related questions, not least who is going to step up to fill the gaps?  Will cities that don't traditionally have strong public transportation systems add to their routes? Will developers create more mixed-use buildings to make shopping and socializing easier to access?  Could the government create a kind of caregiver corps that could check in on the isolated elderly?  Who will pay for this expensive kind of safety net? The cost of Alzheimer's. Currently about 5.2 million Americans have Alzheimer's. That number is expected to double every 20 years. With a cure some way off, what can be done to ease the emotional and financial burden on families and communities affected by the disease? The Alzheimer's Association predicts that by 2050, U.S. costs for care will total $1.2 trillion, making it the most expensive condition in the nation.  How will we be able to afford the costs of caring for this population? What can the country do to achieve the goal the White House set for preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025? Marijuana. With the growing acceptance of weed, we can expect that more laws will change to allow medical and recreational use of marijuana.   How will the rest of the laws in this country adjust?  For instance, Washington state is coming up with a Breathalyzer-type device to check if drivers are high. But it will be interesting to see how readily available these devices are going to be. Will legalization improve the scientific understanding of the long-term consequences of the drug? What other uses could this drug have to help those who may need pain relief most? Missing work-life balance. Americans spend more time on the job than most other developed countries. We don't get as much vacation, we don't take what vacation we have, and we are prone to working nights and weekends. This stress has a negative impact on Americans' health.  What are companies doing to help? What technology can change this phenomenon? Will millennials who say work-life balance is a bigger priority than other generations rub off on the rest of us? What can we personally do to find a better balance? We may not be able to answer all these questions in 2015, but we sure will try.  And the health team and I look forward to exploring these issues with you in the coming New Year.

"Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan (CNN) -- The chief of staff of the interim Kyrgyz government, which took over after President Kurmanbek Bakiev fled the capital, accused the president Friday of stealing the country's money when he left. ""The state coffers are almost empty,"" Edil Baisalov told CNN. ""Some funds have been transferred somewhere, which is why we've frozen the banking system, because we are anxious that the banks controlled by the former President Bakiev might take the funds out of the country."" Baisalov said all that's left in the country's bank accounts is the equivalent of 16 million euros ($21.5 million). Government officials in Kyrgyzstan had earlier declared Friday and Saturday days of mourning as relatives began burying victims of anti-government riots that killed 76 and forced the president to flee the capital. At the same time, criminal charges were brought against Bakiev's two sons, as well as his brother, who used to be the chief of security, acting Prosecutor-General Baytemir Ibrayev said. It is believed the president's brother gave orders to open fire on the demonstrators, he said. Criminal charges also have been brought against the mayor of Bishkek, Ibrayev said. More details about the charges weren't immediately clear. Overnight, hundreds of men joined vigilante groups to help fight looters in Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital. At least 60 people were injured in the clashes overnight Thursday, none of them seriously, the Health Ministry said. Another 520 people have been hospitalized since the protests started Tuesday, officials said. Sporadic bursts of machine-gun fire and police sirens rang out through the night Thursday. It was not immediately clear where the shooting was, but police said looting remained a challenge. Local health authorities reported Friday that the death toll from the riots had increased by one, to 76, because a person in critical condition died. Bakiev, who fled to his stronghold in the south of the country, said he was not giving up power despite claims by a former foreign minister that she was in charge. ""Realizing my responsibilities as president of the Kyrgyz republic, I am confident the country where the government comes to power through blood can lose its statehood,"" Bakiev said in a statement posted on 24.kg, a well known Kyrgyz Web site. ""I am urging the instigators of the riots to think again. I am stating that, as president, I did not abandon my duties, and I am not abandoning my duties. Irresponsible actions of the opposition could only cause more escalation of tensions."" Former Foreign Minister Roza Otunbayeva declared herself the country's interim leader Thursday and said the opposition had taken over the reins of government and driven Bakiev from office. Otunbayeva said at a news conference that the former president was in the south of the country with his entourage. Opposition leaders had accused Bakiev of consolidating power by keeping key economic and security posts in the hands of relatives or close associates. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe sent a special envoy to Kyrgyzstan, who met Friday with interim Deputy Foreign Minister Nurlan Aytmurzaev to talk about ways to restore stability, the OSCE said. The envoy, Zhanybek Karibzhanov, said he was discussing ""the situation on the ground, how public safety, stability and respect for citizens' rights can be urgently restored and ensured, and how we in the OSCE can contribute to the process."" The OSCE and United Nations have expressed concern about the situation in Kyrgyzstan, a Central Asian country on China's far western border. The protests began Tuesday in the northern city of Talas. They were sparked by increases in electricity and fuel rates, which had gone up at the first of the year as Bakiev's government sold public utilities to companies controlled by his friends. Demonstrations spread to the capital Wednesday after the government arrested opposition leaders in Talas. Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic, houses the Manas Transit Center that forms an important link in the supply line for United States and NATO forces in nearby Afghanistan. The new government denied reports that it was planning to shut down the air base, but said it intends to review the issue. In Washington, a senior Pentagon official told CNN that the turmoil had interrupted flights into and out of that facility. Normal flight operations resumed Friday afternoon, but by the evening, military passenger transport flights were temporarily diverted, said Maj. John Redfield, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command. He didn't say when the flights would resume. ""Decisions on conducting other, non-passenger-related flight operations from the base will be made on a case-by-case basis,"" he said. Some U.S. Embassy personnel and their families were temporarily relocated to Manas, the U.S. Department of State announced Friday. The department advised U.S. citizens in the country to avoid large gatherings and stay indoors. Those who cannot find safe shelter should contact the embassy, the department said. The United States has closed its embassy in Bishkek, a senior State Department official said Thursday. ""We have concerns about the situation on the ground,"" U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Thursday. Crowley said the United States is not taking sides. ""Our interest here is with the people of Kyrgyzstan and a peaceful resolution of the situation,"" Crowley said. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Chief of staff of interim government accuses president of raiding state coffers .

"Suspected Boko Haram militants opened fire on a village market and burned homes in the northeastern Nigerian state of Borno late Sunday, killing at least 45 people and injuring 26 others, the state's police commissioner said. The gunmen arrived in the village of Kawuri in all-terrain vehicles, shot people at the market while traders were closing shop for the day, and burned a number of thatched homes, Borno state police commissioner Lawan Tanko said. A witness, merchant Isa Ibrahim, said the attackers initially pretended to be traders at the market. He said it appeared bombs were used in the attacks, possibly planted ahead of time. Tanko, the police commissioner, said it was not yet clear if explosives were used, adding a police bomb squad was searching for any unexploded ordnance. Boko Haram is an Islamist militant group that has waged a campaign of violence in northeastern Nigeria, trying to impose a strict version of Sharia, or Islamic law. Borno is one of three states in northeastern Nigeria that have been under a state of emergency since May because of the violence.","Police: Gunmen shot at people as traders were closing market in Kawuri village Sunday .

"Actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, who was found dead February 2 on the bathroom floor of his New York apartment with a syringe in his left arm, died of acute mixed drug intoxication, including heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines and amphetamine, the New York medical examiner's office said Friday. The manner of death was ruled an accident, the medical examiner's office said in a statement. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said that as addicts take mixtures of drugs more chronically, they may not necessarily feel the effects of the narcotics, which still suppress the respiratory system. ""They're not feeling it, but it's still having an impact on their ability to breathe, and that's the real problem,"" he said. ""It's called stacking. You can stack the same drug too close together, or you can start to stack other drugs, one on top of the other. That's how people get into trouble. They do call it accidental death as well."" Police found nearly 50 envelopes branded ""Ace of Spades"" filled with what they believe was heroin in the actor's Manhattan apartment, two law enforcement sources familiar with the inquiry said. Used syringes, prescription drugs and empty bags that authorities suspect were used to hold heroin also were found in the apartment where Hoffman, 46, was found dead, sources said. He was expected to pick up his children that day but didn't show up, the official said. Playwright David Katz and another person went to the apartment and found him dead, the official said. Police officers found him in a T-shirt and shorts with his eyeglasses still on his head. Robert Vineberg, a 57-year-old musician, was arrested in connection with Hoffman's death and released on bail earlier this month. Vineberg was among four people arrested in Manhattan in the days after Hoffman's death. Prosecutors said Vineberg, who was arrested on a felony charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance, had just under 50 small bags of heroin as well as packaging paraphernalia in his apartment during a raid. In another one of his apartments in the same Mott Street building, prosecutors said, 250 small bags of heroin were found. Vineberg was found to have the actor's phone number stored in his cell phone, a law enforcement official told CNN. Two other people arrested in connection with Hoffman's death -- Juliana Luchkiw and Max Rosenblum, both 22 -- were released earlier this month until their next court dates. Prosecutors did not file charges against a fourth person arrested in the raid. Hoffman was mourned in New York February 7 in a star-studded private funeral attended by family and close friends. Hoffman, who was nominated for Academy Awards four times, won the Oscar for best actor in 2006 for his portrayal of writer Truman Capote in ""Capote."" He earned Academy Award nominations for roles in ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" ""Doubt,"" and ""The Master.""","Academy Award-winning actor was found dead February 2 with a needle in his arm .

"London (CNN)A nurse who is being treated for Ebola in a London hospital after contracting the disease while volunteering in Sierra Leone is now in critical condition, the hospital said Saturday. Pauline Cafferkey, 39, of Glasgow is the first person to have been diagnosed with the virus on UK soil. The Royal Free Hospital said her condition ""has gradually deteriorated over the past two days and is now critical."" The hospital said Wednesday that Cafferkey had decided to have blood plasma treatment -- using plasma from Ebola survivors -- and to take an experimental antiviral drug. British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted that his thoughts and prayers are with Cafferkey. The Royal Free Hospital is equipped with a high-level isolation unit where access is restricted to specially trained medical staff. A specially designed tent with controlled ventilation is over the patient's bed. Another British volunteer nurse, William Pooley, was treated in the unit after his return home from Sierra Leone in August after being diagnosed with Ebola. British media outlets have said Cafferkey is a public health nurse who was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to Sierra Leone by the UK government last month in a joint endeavor with the charity Save the Children. Cafferkey traveled back from Sierra Leone via Casablanca, Morocco, and London Heathrow Airport before arriving at Glasgow Airport on a British Airways flight late on December 28, the health agency NHS Scotland said. After feeling unwell, she sought medical attention and was transferred to London on a military aircraft fitted with an isolation pod. Amid concerns about the possible spread of the disease, authorities have been working to contact all those who may have come into contact with Cafferkey as she traveled back to Scotland. What to know about Ebola . Public Health England, a government agency, said it had contacted all 101 UK-based passengers and crew who flew from Casablanca to Heathrow, while its Scottish counterpart had reached all 71 passengers and crew members who traveled from Heathrow to Glasgow. ""Passengers given advice & reassurance. Additional 31 international passengers being contacted by international public health authorities,"" Public Health England said on Twitter. The government has said the risk of infection to other passengers is ""considered extremely low."" The number of deaths in the three West African countries where the outbreak is centered has climbed to 7,989 as of December 31, the World Health Organization said Friday. There have been more than 20,000 confirmed, probable and suspected cases in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, the WHO said.","Prime Minister Cameron says his thoughts and prayers are with Pauline Cafferkey .

"(CNN) -- A major earthquake struck southern Haiti on Tuesday, knocking down buildings and power lines and inflicting what its ambassador to the United States called a catastrophe for the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation. Several eyewitnesses reported heavy damage and bodies in the streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, where concrete-block homes line steep hillsides. There was no estimate of the dead and wounded Tuesday evening, but the U.S. State Department has been told to expect ""serious loss of life,"" department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters in Washington. ""The only thing I can do now is pray and hope for the best,"" the ambassador, Raymond Alcide Joseph, told CNN. Pictures sent to CNN's iReport show homes and small businesses in Haiti that have collapsed. Are you there? Submit an iReport . The magnitude 7.0 quake -- the most powerful to hit Haiti in a century -- struck shortly before 5 p.m. and was centered about 10 miles (15 kilometers) southwest of Port-au-Prince, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. It could be felt strongly in eastern Cuba, more than 200 miles away, witnesses said. Experts warned of earthquake risk on Haiti . Mike Godfrey, an American contractor working for the U.S. Agency for International Development, said ""a huge plume of dust and smoke rose up over the city"" within minutes of the quake -- ""a blanket that completely covered the city and obscured it for about 20 minutes."" Witnesses reported damaged buildings throughout the capital, including the president's residence and century-old homes nearby, and The Associated Press reported that a hospital collapsed. President Rene Preval is safe, Joseph said, but there was no estimate of the dead and wounded Tuesday evening. He said an official of his government told him houses had crumbled ""on the right side of the street and the left side of the street."" ""He said it is a catastrophe of major proportions,"" Joseph said. Impact Your World: How you can help . Frank Williams, the Haitian director of the relief agency World Vision International, said the quake left people ""pretty much screaming"" all around Port-au-Prince. He said the agency's building shook for about 35 seconds, ""and portions of things on the building fell off."" ""None of our staff were injured, but lots of walls are falling down,"" Williams said. ""Many of our staff have tried to leave, but were unsuccessful because the walls from buildings and private residences are falling into the streets, so that it has pretty much blocked significantly most of the traffic."" Read what people in Haiti are saying via social media . Haiti's government is backed by a U.N. peacekeeping mission established after the ouster of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004. The headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Port-au-Prince collapsed, a U.N. official told CNN. There was no immediate report of any dead or wounded from the building, but Alain Le Roy, the undersecretary-general for peacekeeping operations said of the 9,000-member, Brazilian led-force, ""For the moment, a large number of personnel remain unaccounted for.""   Outside the capital, several people were hurt when they rushed to get out of a school in the southwestern city of Les Cayes, said the Rev. Kesner Ajax, the school's executive director. Two homes in the area collapsed and the top of a church collapsed in a nearby town, he said, but he did not know of any fatalities. Les Cayes, a city of about 400,000 people, is about 140 miles (225 kilometers) southwest of Port-au-Prince. The quake took place about 6 miles (10 kilometers) underground, according to the USGS -- a depth that can produce severe shaking. At least 10 aftershocks followed, including two in the magnitude 5 range, the USGS reported. Appeals for aid after quake strikes Haiti . Jean Bernard, an eyewitness in Port-au-Prince, told CNN the city had no electricity Tuesday evening. The first quake lasted 35 to 40 seconds, he said. ""A lot of houses [and] buildings went down, and people are still running all over the streets,"" Bernard said. ""People are looking for their wives, looking for their husbands and their kids. It's scary."" Luke Renner, an American staying in Cap-Hatien, a city nearly 100 miles north of Port-au-Prince, said he was sitting at his home when ""the whole world started to shake."" ""It felt like our whole house was balancing on a beach ball,"" Renner said. ""We heard the whole community screaming and in an uproar during that whole 20- to 30-second window."" ""I haven't seen any structural damage here,"" Renner continued. ""With the sun setting it may be difficult to tell. In the morning we'll know for sure."" Because of the earthquake's proximity to the capital, and because the city is densely populated and has poorly constructed housing, ""it could cause significant casualties,"" said Jian Lin, a senior geologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. In Washington, President Obama said the U.S. government would ""stand ready to assist the people of Haiti."" At the Pentagon, the U.S. military said humanitarian aid was being prepared for shipping, but it was not yet clear where or how it would be sent. A U.S. aviation source said the control tower at the Port-au-Prince international airport collapsed, possibly hindering efforts to fly relief supplies into the country. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters that Washington is offering ""our full assistance"" to Haiti."" The deputy chief of the U.S. mission in Haiti, David Lindwall, told Clinton that he saw ""significant damage"" from the quake and said U.S. officials there expect ""serious loss of life,"" Crowley said. And Clinton's husband, former President Clinton -- now the U.N. special envoy for Haiti -- said the world body was ""committed to do whatever we can to assist the people of Haiti in their relief, rebuilding and recovery efforts."" The United States has been heavily involved in Haiti commercially, politically and militarily for most of the last century. U.S. intervention under Clinton restored Aristide to power in 1994 after a 1991 coup, and a U.S. jet hustled him out of the country again in 2004 following a rapidly spreading uprising against his government. The disaster is the latest to befall the country of about 9 million people, roughly the size of Maryland. It is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and among the poorest in the world. With people stripping the trees for fuel and to clear land for agriculture, the mountainous countryside has been heavily deforested. That has led to severe erosion and left Haitians vulnerable to massive landslides when heavy rains fall. Hurricane Gordon killed more than 1,000 people in 1994, while Hurricane Georges killed more than 400 and destroyed the majority of the country's crops in 1998. And in 2004, Hurricane Jeanne killed more than 3,000 people as it passed north of Haiti, with most of the deaths in the northwestern city of Gonaives. Gonaives was hit heavily again in 2008, when four tropical systems passed through. In addition, a Haitian school collapsed in November 2008, killing more than 90 people and injuring 150 -- a disaster authorities blamed on poor construction. Eighty percent of Haiti's population lives under the poverty line, according to the CIA World Factbook.

"Israel reacted angrily Sunday to recent reports that British and U.S. intelligence officials spied on top Israeli officials' e-mails. ""The tracking after prime ministers and defense ministers is not legitimate and not acceptable to us,"" the spokesman of Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz said, according to a CNN translation. ""There is an intelligence alliance between (the United States and Israel) at an unprecedented level, and we are sharing the most sensitive (intelligence) material."" On Friday, The Guardian, The New York Times and Der Spiegel newspapers reported that the communications of more than 1,000 organizations and individuals were monitored from a facility in southwest England. NSA leaks point at high-tech eavesdropping hub in UK . Der Spiegel, a German publication, wrote: ""At least four Israeli targets are named in the lists, including an email address named as the 'Israeli prime minister.' "" The document, among those provided by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, is from early 2009. A spokeswoman for the NSA said Friday the United States collects foreign intelligence just as many other nations do. ""The intelligence community's efforts to understand economic systems and policies, and monitor anomalous economic activities, are critical to providing policymakers with the information they need to make informed decisions that are in the best interest of our national security,"" Vanee Vines said. None of the newspapers published any of the documents they were shown, and the volume of information collected on any particular individual or organization is unclear. On Friday afternoon, the U.S. State Department's spokeswoman said Secretary of State John Kerry has been communicating with U.S. allies. ""The secretary has been a part of engaging on this process, whether it's discussing with foreign countries their concerns, attempting -- working to alleviate those,"" spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""Our goal remains to continue to strengthen our intel gathering processes and relationships. But I'm not going to speak to different reports or allegations."" President Barack Obama vowed this month to find ways of reforming the NSA, though he also defended the agency's work. Obama is going through 40 recommendations made last week by the independent presidential Review Group on Intelligence. He will make a ""definitive statement"" on surveillance programs in January after he returns from a Hawaiian vacation. Surveillance program is now Obama's to own . Israel has said it would never spy on the U.S. in the wake of the conviction of a former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst who was caught spying for Israel in 1985. Jonathan Pollard was sentenced to life in 1987 after he was convicted of one count of espionage, and since then many Israeli leaders have appealed to U.S. presidents for his release. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the newest revelations have no bearing on the case. ""We do not need any special event in order to discuss the release of Jonathan Pollard. We are dealing with it. I am dealing with it, with all U.S. presidents, including President Obama, all the time, including now,"" he said Sunday at the weekly Cabinet meeting.

"Ukraine's government and separatist leaders signed a ceasefire deal Friday after talks in Belarus, raising hopes of an end to the nearly five-month conflict that has wracked eastern Ukraine. The ceasefire went into effect at 6 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET) on the order of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. It was not immediately clear if it would hold. Artillery fire and explosions were heard in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk as of 6 p.m. local time, the city's website said. But a CNN team in southeastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces and the rebels have engaged in fierce fighting this week between the Russian border and the port city of Mariupol, said that as of 20 minutes into the ceasefire period there had been no renewal of artillery fire. President Barack Obama said he was hopeful but skeptical that a ceasefire in Ukraine would hold, questioning if pro-Russian rebels would adhere to it. Obama, speaking at the end of a NATO summit in Wales, added that NATO was ""fully united in support of Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and ability to defend itself."" Member nations would send nonlethal military aid and help modernize Ukraine's security forces while the United States and European allies finalize measures ""to deepen and broaden sanctions"" against Russia, he said. ""Russia's aggression against Ukraine threatens our vision of a Europe that is whole, free and at peace."" he said. Speaking to reporters at the same summit, Poroshenko said the ceasefire deal was based on his peace plan and an agreement reached in a phone call this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine were key to the 12-point plan. He also said he hoped the exchange of prisoners would start in the near future, perhaps as soon as Saturday. Poroshenko said it was important that ceasefire lasted, and that during this period a political dialogue should continue on restoring peace and stability to the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. ""We are ready to provide significant steps, including the decentralization of power,"" he said, as well as  greater economic freedoms for the Luhansk and Donetsk regions and guarantees that their culture and language be respected. Many in the region are Russian speaking. The self-styled Donetsk People's Republic Twitter feed also said the ceasefire had been signed and that it would come into effect at 6 p.m. local time. However, the ceasefire does not mean the end of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, separatist leaders said at a televised news conference after signing it. Poroshenko has asked his foreign minister and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which already has international observers in Ukraine, to monitor compliance with the ceasefire. ""The entire world strives for peace, the entire Ukraine strives for peace, including millions of Donbas residents,"" he said. ""The highest value is human life. We must do everything possible and impossible to terminate bloodshed and put an end to people's suffering."" A previous unilateral ceasefire declared by the Ukrainian government in June broke down after 10 days. Sanctions on table . A ceasefire deal may have been signed, but Putin remains under international pressure over Russia's actions in Ukraine. UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who is hosting the summit in Wales, said in his final remarks that what Putin was doing is ""indefensible and wrong."" A package of EU sanctions ""is being finalized in Brussels that will further increase the economic costs to Russia for its behavior,"" he said. ""We stand firmly behind Ukraine's right to make its own decisions, not to have then dictated by Russian tanks rolling over the border."" Europe and the United States are firmly resolved to maintain their pressure on Russia, in support of Ukraine, he said. ""At the end of the day, Russia needs Europe and America more than Europe and America need Russia. We have to make that relationship pay,"" he said. ""If they go on destabilizing this country, partitioning this country, they will face more pressure,"" he said of the Russians. Earlier Friday, EU spokesman Maja Kocijancic said a decision on implementing the proposed new round of sanctions ""will only be taken in light of developments on the ground."" She added, ""If there is a ceasefire agreed in Minsk today, member states would look at how serious it was and decide whether to go forward."" Russia: Volunteer fighters in Ukraine . Kiev and the West accuse Moscow of both arming the rebels and sending Russian troops into Ukraine to aid them -- claims Moscow denies. Andrey Kelin, Russia's Permanent Representative to the OSCE, on Friday repeated Russia's longstanding denial that it had troops in Ukraine. Kelin told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that there are no Russian forces in Ukraine.  But, he admitted, there may be Russian ""volunteers, probably former military men"" who are fighting on behalf of the separatists, which he calls ""freedom fighters."" The talks in the capital of Belarus, Minsk, brought together the leaders of the separatist groups with former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, as well as Russian representatives. Putin set out his own seven-point peace plan after talking by phone with Poroshenko this week. It included a halt by both parties of ""any offensive military operations"" in Donetsk and Luhansk, international monitoring of the ceasefire, prisoner exchanges and the opening of a humanitarian corridor to allow aid to reach civilians. Ukraine: Russian losses number 2,000 . The conflict in eastern Ukraine showed no sign of abating Friday morning. Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the National Defense and Security Council, said that there had been 27 clashes in the past 24 hours, including at Donetsk airport, and that shelling from Russian territory continued. Ukrainian forces in Mariupol have been bolstered to fight off a rebel advance, he said. A CNN team in Mariupol witnessed shelling Thursday that indicated rebel forces were moving closer. The rebels seized the nearby Ukrainian border town of Novoazovsk last week, allegedly with the help of Russian forces, and have been threatening to advance on Mariupol. ""According to preliminary intelligence information, overall Russian losses over the period of the conflicts are about 2,000 killed,"" Lysenko said. It was not clear if he was referring to Russian citizens or troops. Lysenko added that the number injured could be four times as many, and they are being treated in hospitals in Russia. Since the conflict began in mid-April, 846 Ukrainian soldiers have died and 3,072 have been wounded, he said. NATO warning . Russia's alleged incursion and the threat that its forces could move deeper into Ukraine have caught the attention of the West. ""This is the first time since the end of World War II that one European country has tried to grab another's territory by force,"" NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. ""Europe must not turn away from the rule of law to the rule of the strongest."" Putin has voiced sympathy for the separatists, many of whom are ethnic Russians. But he denies that Russia has armed and trained the rebels, or sent Russian troops over the border. In July, Obama and the European Union announced sanctions against Russia's state-owned banks, weapons makers and oil companies, along with Putin's top cronies, an extension of previous sanctions against targeted individuals and companies. Moscow responded by banning imports of fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, milk and dairy products from the U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada and Norway. In what may be another retaliatory move, Russia's federal consumer rights protection service banned all confectionery imports from Ukraine, Russian state news agency ITAR-Tass reported Friday. It said the ban was imposed to protect consumer rights.","President Barack Obama says he's hopeful but skeptical about the ceasefire .

"(CNN)In this brave, forever-new world of social media, the minutiae of daily life can be documented for public consumption with the tap of a finger. For many, that includes pictures of what they're consuming on a daily basis, from their morning latte to their evening glass of wine and every Cronut in between. Immortalizing food imagery is certainly not a new phenomenon, though the mediums in which to do so have come a long way from canvases to smartphones. During the Renaissance era, food often appeared in popular works of art by way of still-life paintings, and painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio is often heralded for elevating the seemingly simplistic genre with dramatic lighting, angles and imperfections. Photographer Rebecca Ruetten was inspired by the ""eroticism, presentation and charisma"" of these paintings by Caravaggio and artists like Luis Melendez, Diego Velazquez and Pieter Claesz, so she decided to approach a distinctly modern phenomenon -- fast food -- in the Renaissance-era style. ""Fast food is created to attract, but everybody knows the food they order will -- in the end -- never look like the food in the advertisement's photo,"" Ruetten said. In her series ""Contemporary Pieces,"" she theatrically lights meals of Taco Bell, KFC, McDonald's, Panda Express and donuts, while models pose with hot dogs, marshmallows, ice cream and pizza. Ruetten sees fast food as a symbol of class divide, much like Caravaggio unconventionally relied on lower classes of Roma people, laborers and even prostitutes to pose for many of his works. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. ""To eat healthy is expensive,"" Ruetten said. ""However, one can buy large amounts of food at a fast-food restaurant for a comparatively low price."" Ruetten said she was inspired by Caraveggio's atypical models and asked her ""punk and hippie"" friends with visible tattoos and piercings to take part. ""It underlines the concept that they are 'children of the modern age,' having been brought up in the changing America, often defined by the culture of fast food,"" Ruetten said. And in an interesting twist of fate, Ruetten said, most of her subjects avoid the exact type of food they were photographed with. ""To them, the food becomes a non-edible object and loses its value as being considered food,"" she said. Rebecca Ruetten is a photographer who also works under the pseudonym Becky Fuchs.

"Nigeria's president declared states of emergency Tuesday for three states, blaming ""terrorists"" aimed at ""rebellion"" who have caused ""fear among our citizens and a near breakdown of law and order in parts of the country."" The order, issued by President Goodluck Jonathan, applies to Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states in northeastern Nigeria. He also noted a rise of insurgent violence in eight other states as well, including Nasarawa, where scores of police officers were killed last week. Scores of police officers killed in central Nigeria . ""We have taken robust steps to unravel and address the root causes of these crises, but it would appear that there is a systematic effort by insurgents and terrorists to destabilize the Nigerian state and test our collective resolve,"" Jonathan said in a televised speech. Insisting they weren't simply criminals, the president said ""terrorist groups"" were staging a ""rebellion and insurgency"" that threatened Nigeria's ""unity and territorial integrity."" Some northern parts of Borno state have already been taken over by such groups, as Jonathan noted. Such violence over the years has been blamed on Boko Haram, whose name means ""Western education is sacrilege."" According to Human Rights Watch, the group has killed more than 2,800 people in an escalating campaign to impose strict Islamic law on largely Muslim northern Nigeria. Attempts at dialogue -- which will continue, the president said -- have failed to curb militants' efforts ""to progressively overwhelm the ... country."" He cited several recent examples of violence, including the killing of ""innocent civilians and state officials,"" attacks on government buildings and facilities and the destruction of Nigeria's flag for ""strange flags"" instead. ""These actions amount to a declaration of war and a deliberate attempt to undermine the authority of the Nigerian state and threaten her territorial integrity,"" Jonathan said.

The president said he'll send more troops to the three states, adding that they and other security forces there have orders to ""take all necessary action.""

"The Greek parliament voted Sunday to approve the nation's 2013 budget that contains steep austerity cuts required for Greece to receive the next installment of a crucial economic bailout. The cuts have provoked ire among Greeks furious about the effects of multiple rounds of belt-tightening, which have resulted in cuts to pensions and pay. Greece has seen its unemployment soar to more than 25%. The final tally in the 300-member parliament was 167 votes in favor, 128 opposed, with four abstentions. One lawmaker was not present at the vote, which took place amid protests organized by Greece's largest public and private sector unions. Addressing lawmakers ahead the vote, Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras pledged the severe spending cuts included in the budget would be the last the Greek people will have to face. Greece, ""as of tommorrow, turns a page,"" he said. Even though the parliament approved the budget, a disagreement among its creditors may delay delivery of the financial aid. Reports from Brussels and elsewhere suggest that the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund officials have been unable to reach an agreement on the release of the money. The EU's finance ministers are set to meet Monday in Brussels, where the bailout funds for Greece, which is grappling with its fifth year of recession, is likely to top the agenda. ""Greece has done what it was asked to do and now is the time for the creditors to make good on their commitments,"" said Samaras. Passage of the austerity cuts was needed for the payout of the next international bailout installment of 31.5 billion euros (about $40.2 billion), which the Greek government desperately needs to stay in operation. Without the aid, Samaras has said, it would run out of money by mid-November. More than one-fifth of the population could face poverty, defined as a family of four on an income of 13,842 euros (about $17,500) per year, state news agency AMNA has reported. The budget contains reforms and fiscal measures worth 13.5 billion euros over the next two years. It will raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 and cut pensions on average between 5% and 15%. Some salaries in the public sector will be reduced by about a third, and several bonuses will be scrapped. Some judges must take a 30% pay cut, for example. The thorniest issue is that of labor law changes. The austerity measures contained in the budget give the government the right to set the minimum wage as of April 2013. It also reduces the redundancy notice period -- the time given to workers to leave their jobs after being laid off -- and limits compensation for workers with more than 16 years of service, as well as allowing stores the right to ask employees to work more flexible hours. The anger in the Greek population against the latest round of cuts, which come on top of many others, runs deep. ""The measures just never stop. Every time, politicians say they are going to be the last measures ... they are never the last,"" Melina Grigoriadou, a 50-year-old married businesswoman with two children, told CNN last week. As lawmakers considered the austerity measures included in the draft budget, protesters in Athens threw Molotov cocktails and police fought back with tear gas outside the parliament as lawmakers prepared to vote. As many as 70,000 people took part in demonstrations in Athens' central Syntagma Square, outside the parliament building, according to police estimates.","The final tally was 167 votes in favor, 128 opposed, with four abstentions .

"Ukrainian acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said Wednesday that the separatist protests in Ukraine's eastern region would be resolved within 48 hours -- either through negotiations or the use of force. At the same time, Russia insisted that the presence of its troops just over the border was no reason to worry. The United States and others have accused Russia of fomenting the separatist unrest as a pretext for military intervention. Using classified and commercial satellite imagery, the United States estimates there are up to 40,000 Russian troops on the border with eastern Ukraine. NATO has also warned of a major troop buildup. The U.S. ambassador in Kiev, Geoffrey Pyatt, posted photos via Twitter on Wednesday to illustrate the U.S. estimates. The photos depict what is supposedly a field outside the Russian city of Rostov --  empty in October, filled with troops and armored vehicles on April 2. A U.S. official with direct knowledge of the matter told CNN those photos ""are consistent"" with classified imagery. Washington is sharing some information with the Ukrainians, but not highly classified intelligence, the official said. Ukraine was aligned with Moscow until a month ago, and it is believed Ukraine's security services are still penetrated by the Russians, the official said. But Russia's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Ukraine and the United States have ""no reason for concern"" about the presence of Russian forces, which it says are on military exercises. ""Russia has repeatedly stated that it does not conduct unusual or unplanned activities which are militarily significant on its territory near the border with Ukraine,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a prepared statement. It added that accusations that Russia was building up its armed forces were ""groundless."" Asked if he considered the threat of a Russian advance into Ukraine more likely now than last week, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told CNN's Jim Sciutto, ""We are always vigilant.  We are always looking at the options that we need to take."" Hagel said Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, has been asked to develop ""new and additional measures and options."" Meanwhile, the separatist protests in eastern Ukraine have entered their fourth day. Pro-Russian protesters seized government buildings in the cities of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv on Sunday. Rebels who occupied Donetsk's regional government building a day later -- declaring a ""people's republic"" and calling for a referendum on secession from Ukraine to be held by May 11 -- remained in control of the building Wednesday, holed up behind substantial makeshift barricades. In Kharkiv, more than 70 people were detained Tuesday in what Ukrainian authorities said was an anti-terrorism operation, as security forces cleared a government building of protesters. The 48-hour deadline set by Avakov to end the crisis may escalate the tensions in Ukraine's eastern region. ""There are two opposite ways for resolving this conflict -- a political dialogue and the heavy-handed approach. We are ready for both,"" he said, according to official news agency Ukrinform. On Tuesday, Moscow warned that any use of force to crack down on protests in the region, which borders Russia, could lead to civil war and called for ""the immediate cessation of any military preparations."" Opinion: Turning Crimea into 'Putinland'? Hostage reports . There were conflicting reports late Tuesday over whether demonstrators who seized control of a Security Service of Ukraine building in Luhansk took hostages. An anti-terrorism unit outside the building said the pro-Russian demonstrators were holding hostages, Victoria Syumar, a Security Service spokeswoman, and Yarema Duh, spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council, told CNN. Fifty-one people were released from the building early Wednesday morning, the Security Service said in a statement. But pro-Russian demonstrators holed up in the building denied having taken anyone hostage, according to Reuters reports. Ukrainian interim President Oleksandr Turchynov reiterated Tuesday that he would treat pro-Russian separatists who have seized buildings in the country's east as ""terrorists"" who will be prosecuted with the full force of the law. His remarks came ahead of a vote in parliament that approved legislation outlawing groups and individuals who call for separatism. Of the 450 members of the Ukrainian parliament, 230 voted in favor of the bill. Kerry: 'Contrived pretext' for intervention . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the situation in eastern Ukraine twice on the phone Wednesday with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The two officials talked about ""the importance of resolving the security situation in key cities in eastern Ukraine peacefully and through dialogue, and they both rejected the use of force to obtain political objectives,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Kerry said Tuesday that Russian forces and special agents were behind what he called the most-recent ""chaos"" in eastern Ukraine. He described the developments as ""more than deeply disturbing"" and said they amounted to what could be a ""contrived pretext for military intervention just as we saw in Crimea."" Echoing that view, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski told CNN's ""Amanpour"" show that Russia is financing subversion in eastern Ukraine using the pretext of ethnic tensions. ""What's happening in Ukraine is unacceptable,"" he said. ""A more powerful nation is first taking a province away from a less powerful country and now financing subversion using the pretext of ethnic problems, which are nonexistent."" Kerry will meet Monday with his Russian, Ukrainian and European Union counterparts to discuss efforts to de-escalate the crisis, according to a statement from EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. Ashton ""calls against any further destabilization of Ukraine, whether from the inside or the outside,"" the statement said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told her country's parliament Wednesday that ""the situation in the Ukraine remains difficult ... and unfortunately in many places it is not clear how Russia helps the de-escalation of the situation. ""Therefore we will continue to do what we've been doing: on the one hand pursue a path of dialogue, but on the other hand make clear that in our view Ukraine has a right to its own development. We demand this. Ukraine must decide its own destiny, and in this we will help Ukraine."" Kerry warned of increased sanctions targeting Russia's banking, energy, mining and arms sectors if the Russians ""cross over"" into eastern Ukraine. Current sanctions target individuals over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's southeastern Crimean Peninsula last month. U.S. Navy ship headed for Black Sea . Similar pattern seen in revolts . U.S. officials told CNN on Tuesday that one reason the United States believes Russia may have orchestrated the pro-Russian demonstrations in Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv is that the disturbances and violence had a similar pattern and similar separatist motivations, even though the cities are at significant distances from one another. U.S. officials have long noted that these three cities are specific areas that Moscow has been trying to influence. Although Ukrainian forces have been able to regain control for now, the U.S. assessment is that Russia may be trying to fabricate a pretext for military action using some of the tens of thousands of troops still massed on the border, several U.S. officials told CNN. Even after weeks of tension and uncertainty, the United States does not know what political calculation Russian President Vladimir Putin might make in deciding whether or not to move his troops into Ukraine, officials said. The belief is the decision will be made by Putin with little or no influence from his top military and foreign policy advisers. There is also a U.S. view that Putin may leave the troops on the border for some time to come to intimidate Ukraine's government, American officials said. Those troops remain positioned so close, and are so heavily armed, that the United States and NATO calculate they could ""roll across"" eastern Ukraine in three to five days, one official said. Russia has said it does not intend to invade eastern Ukraine, although it says it reserves the right to intervene to protect ethnic Russians.","Kerry and Lavrov discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine in two phone conversations .

"The National Institutes of Health will begin testing an experimental Ebola vaccine in people as early as September, the NIH announced Thursday. The federal agency has been working on the Ebola vaccine over the last few years and says it has seen positive results when testing it on primates. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said NIH has been working with the Food and Drug Administration to get the vaccine into early trials as soon as possible. According to NIAID, the results of the trial could come early next year. The announcement comes the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised its travel alert for Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from level two to level three, warning against any nonessential travel to the region due to the Ebola epidemic. Since 2003, the agency has only issued level 3 alerts on two occasions: during the outbreak of SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, in 2003, and in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The CDC is sending 50 additional personnel to the three countries, CDC Director Dr.Tom Frieden said. They will be working to speed up laboratory testing, trace potentially infected people and strengthen the local health care systems. Experts: The U.S. is ready for Ebola . Ebola is believed to have killed 729 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria between March 1 and July 27, according to the World Health Organization. Stopping this particular epidemic could take months. ""It's like fighting a forest fire,"" Frieden said. If you leave even one burning ember, the epidemic can start again. This is not the first Ebola vaccine to be tested on humans and not the only treatment in the works.  In March, a group at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, led by Thomas Geisbert, a professor of microbiology and immunology, was awarded a five year, $26 million grant to work with three promising Ebola therapies. Geisbert is best known as the man who discovered an airborne strain of Ebola that infects only monkeys. The grant covers three treatments that are thought to be the most promising - i.e. they have shown substantial ability to protect animals against Ebola in a laboratory setting,  Geisbert said. ""So these treatments, one of these is actually a vaccine that works as a post-exposure treatment, much like the rabies vaccine when used here in the United States.  Another is a small molecule inhibitor called a SIRNA.  And the third is just conventional monoclonal antibodies.  All of these have been able to protect nonhuman primates against Ebola when given after exposure."" The experimental vaccine Geisbert is working with has been nearly 100% effective in preventing infection in macaque monkeys, and also shows some effectiveness as a treatment when given soon after an exposure.  In 2009, it was given to a lab worker in Germany after the worker reported being accidentally pricked with a needle. The worker did not develop Ebola, although it's not clear whether that's because of the vaccine. Because of its strict rules and standards, the FDA can take years to get a vaccine to market. But it does makes exceptions to fast-track drug development, especially when it comes to deadly diseases like Ebola. Geisbert said that's important, because unlike outbreaks of Ebola in the past, this epidemic is harder to manage . ""I think it's very different, I mean historically outbreaks have occurred in central Africa and they have been relatively easy to contain,"" Geisbert said. ""Usually, the outbreaks tend to occur in small villages, but it's controlled and kind of burns out.  What we are seeing in West Africa here is completely different. ""They are having the virus occur simultaneously across a very large geographic area in different locations all at the same time.  And that's very difficult to contain because again the organizations with the expertise in controlling these outbreaks, their resources are really spread thin."" The Ebola infection often is fatal.  At this point, there are no vaccines that protect humans from the deadly virus. According to the World Health Organization, more than 1,300 people have been infected in West Africa in this recent epidemic. Public health officials have called this the worst Ebola outbreak in history.

"The United States has brought  Abu Anas al Libi -- an alleged al Qaeda operative whom U.S. Army Delta Force soldiers captured in Libya this month -- to New York, a U.S. attorney's office said Monday. He was transferred to law enforcement custody and brought to the United States on Saturday, according to a letter from the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara to a federal judge. Al Libi is expected to appear before a judicial officer on Tuesday, Bharara's office said. His family in Tripoli said they were shocked that he was in the United States. They had received no details of his whereabouts from the U.S. or Libyan governments, family members told CNN. His son, Abdullah, said the family hoped to get him a lawyer that would ""work with him, for him."" It was unclear if al Libi already has a lawyer. ""We don't want him talking to just anyone,"" Abdullah said. ""We don't want just any lawyer asking him questions."" A U.S. official said al Libi received care at a medical facility in New York for a pre-existing medical condition and is ""doing better."" The official did not detail the medical issue. His wife told CNN this month that al Libi has a severe case of hepatitis C and that she was worried about his health. U.S. special operations forces captured al Libi in Tripoli more than a week ago. The 49-year-old native of Libya is accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. The United States had been holding him aboard a Navy ship, U.S. officials said. He was questioned there by members of a high-value detainee interrogation team, the officials said. American officials have described him as ""one of the world's most wanted terrorists."" He was indicted in 2001 by the federal court in the Southern District of New York in the embassy bombings and in connection with his alleged roles in al Qaeda conspiracies to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia. Some terrorism experts have questioned how much valuable intelligence al Libi would be able to provide for his captors. A former jihadist associate told CNN last week that it was unlikely that he was still playing an active role with the terrorist network. His wife said he was no longer a member of al Qaeda, had been living a normal life and was seeking a job with the Libyan oil ministry. Al Libi was captured October 5 on the street in front of his home as he returned in his car from morning prayers. President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have previously said they prefer to try individuals such as al Libi in American courts. Trying such suspects on American soil has been a controversial topic in the past. In 2009, Holder said five detainees with alleged ties to the September 11, 2001, attacks would be transferred from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to New York for trial in civilian court. Later Holder reversed course, announcing that accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others would be tried in a military commission at Guantanamo instead. State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said last week that there was no chance that al Libi would end up at Guantanamo. ""The administration's position on Guantanamo is clear. Our goal is not to add to the population, it's to reduce it, which we've done. ... Our policy is not to send any new detainees to Guantanamo,"" she said. Still, Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said Monday that it was ""unfortunate that al Libi is on American soil, ending the interrogation process."" ""It shows the inherent flaws in the U.S. policy decision to try (terror suspects) in the U.S. because once you arrive on U.S. soil, that ends the interrogation of these high value detainees,"" Kind said, said, adding would not have happened if al Libi had been sent to Guantanamo Bay and faced a military commission there. King, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, credited the government with giving advance notice of al Libi's arrival to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelley, which allowed them to have security measures in place.","Al Libi received medical treatment in New York for pre-existing condition, official says .

"It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a ... drone? More and more often, large commercial airliners are encountering small, unmanned aircraft flying through the sky, sometimes undetected by the human eye, and often invisible from the cockpit of a large airplane. According to Michael Huerta, head of the Federal Aviation Administration, regulations are in place to prevent drones from interfering with large aircraft -- but education about drone safety and regulation enforcement needs to be improved in order to actually keep airways safe. ""That is certainly a serious concern and it is something that I am concerned about,"" Huerta told Candy Crowley on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""That's why we are very focused on education. That's why we're also focused on enforcement. We've enforced hundreds of these cases where we have seen someone operating one of these things carelessly and recklessly and posing the danger to aircraft, and that can't happen."" Since drones have entered the commercial market, the FAA reports pilots have seen up to 25 cases per month of drones flying above the regulated limit of 400 feet, with some flying as high as 2,000 feet in the air. Huerta says the FAA is working to educate people about the dangers of flying drones that high, since enforcement of the small, unmanned aerial vehicles can be difficult. ""(A) big part of what we're doing is educating people,"" Huerta said. ""These are very high performance aircraft, and they are difficult to see and this is one of the big challenges, and so that's why the rules require that people stay away from airports."" ""We have been working with the Model Aeronautics Association, with the model community and clubs so we can educate people because these are not your typical pilots that may be flying one of these for the first time and they may be unfamiliar with the rules,"" he added. In 2012, the FAA set a September 2015 deadline to lay out a concrete list of rules and regulations for flying commercial drones, many of which are operated from the ground by untrained civilians. The current rules prohibit owners from flying drones higher than 400 feet, near an airport, or out of eyesight. But enforcing those regulations can be difficult, especially in light of the increasing rate of commercial use. Still, proponents of drone use argue the unmanned aerial vehicles have great potential for both surveillance and commercialism, a balance which Huerta says the FAA is working to achieve. ""Yes, there are proponents of unmanned aircraft and they really see huge potential with this technology and for them, we can't move fast enough,"" Huerta said. ""What they would like to see is free and open use of unmanned aircraft as soon as we can get there."" ""On the other side, you have pilots, commercial pilots, general aviation pilots, who are very concerned that these are difficult to see, they don't really have a good understanding of how they interact with other aircraft, and bedrock principle of aviation is a principle called see and avoid. The pilots take action to avoid one another. So it's for that reason that we have a plan for a staged and thoughtful integration of unmanned aircraft where we look at lower risk uses first, and then gradually work to others. "" Of course, the added technology also creates a new avenue for national security concerns, mainly terrorism. In response to that potential threat, Huerta says the FAA will be publishing a ""rule-making"" that takes into consideration the qualifications of the drone operator, and the certification of the aircraft. ""I can't say what is going to be in it but broadly speaking, what we are looking at are all the questions relating to how we certify the aircraft and what are the qualifications of the operator as well as what uses they can be put to,"" Huerta said.","FAA Administrator Michael Huerta says increased drone regulations are needed to increase safety .

"(Reader's Digest) -- Brazilians feel the most pressure to lose weight and be thin, according to an international poll. Eighty-three percent of those polled in Brazil said they felt the pressure to be slimmer, followed by India (68 percent), the U.S. (62 percent) and France (55 percent), according to the survey, commissioned by Reader's Digest for its February issue. The poll of 16,000 people across 16 countries suggests most of us believe too much emphasis is put on being slim. Even so, most have tried to lose weight. And, everywhere, women are significantly more likely than men to feel the pressure. Russians are the most likely to turn to cigarettes to lose weight (23 percent of men and 18 percent of women), while Mexicans are most likely to choose a healthier diet or physical exercise. The poll also shows that France blames the prevalence of fast-food in the U.S. for Americans' growing girths -- and many Americans agree, with almost three-quarters of those polled in the U.S. admitting their eating habits promote obesity. Meanwhile, 51 percent of married American women wish their husbands were thinner with 47 percent of American husbands wishing the same of their spouses. According to the World Health Organization, more people in the world now die from being overweight and obese than being underweight. It says there are about 1.6 billion overweight or obese people in the world and at least 2.5 million deaths are associated with these conditions annually. ""Although the universal weight struggle is clear from our poll results, obesity is not our collective destiny,"" said Reader's Digest VP/Global Editor-in-Chief Peggy Northrop. ""Most cultures have some custom that can keep people lean, from a bottle of mineral water on most restaurant tables in Europe to the downsizing of supersizing portions in the UK. There is a huge opportunity to learn from each other how to eat healthy.""

"In the aftermath of dramatic events like Monday's bombing attack at the Boston Marathon, it's a truth of our times that millions of people will get early bits of news via social media. To be sure, sites like Twitter and Facebook were used extensively by police, relief groups and governments to share important information about the bombings. But there's also a more unfortunate side to how the Web responds to sudden bad news. Sometimes accidentally and sometimes maliciously, false information gets loose. And in the rapid-fire digital echo chamber, it doesn't take long to spread. ""On days like this, Twitter shows its best & worst: loads of info at huge speed, but often false & sometimes deliberately so,"" said Mark Blank-Settle, of the BBC College of Journalism, in a post on the site. As always, news discovered online (or anywhere else, really) should be double-checked before it's passed along -- especially in times of tragedy. Here are some of the most widely shared untrue news items we've found on social media in the past 24 hours. Man planned to propose, girlfriend killed . Among the many gripping images to emerge from the bombing's aftermath was one of a man in a red shirt, kneeling on the ground cradling a woman in his arms. It went viral -- with a heartbreaking, but fake, story attached. ""The man in the red shirt planned to propose to his girlfriend as he crossed the finish line of the Boston Marathon, but she passed away"" it reads. ""Most of us will never experience this amount of emotional pain."" The image is, in fact, real. It comes from the Boston Globe and was shared through Getty Images. But the agency's caption merely describes the scene as a man comforting an injured woman at the finish line. That didn't stop it from making the rounds in a big way. A somewhat misleading Facebook account pretending to represent actor Will Ferrell (it calls itself a ""parody"" but has 385,000 likes) shared the post. By Tuesday morning, the picture had more than 448,000 ""likes"" and had been shared over 92,000 times. Young girl died at finish line . Another heart-wrenching image of a supposed victim went viral. In this one, a young girl running in a road race is pictured, with text saying she died in one of the blasts. As an added cruel twist, the post says she was ""running for the Sandy Hook victims."" But a quick look at the photo shows that her runner's bib is from the Joe Cassella 5K in Great Falls, Virginia. Also, the Boston Marathon does not allow runners that young. On Google+, one of the users who shared the image followed it with ""poor little girl..got killed in boston..):"" By Tuesday, it had more than 500 comments and had become a ""What's Hot"" post on the site -- appearing in the feeds of all users who haven't turned off that feature. On Tuesday, organizers of that race shot down the tale on their Facebook account. ""We would like to clarify that the picture circulating on the web and Twitter of a little girl wearing a Joe Cassella 5K bib claiming to have been killed at the Boston marathon is being used fraudulently,"" read the page for the Joe Cassella Foundation. The group raises funds for the families of children who are ill in the Washington area. Race organizers will donate for retweets . A Twitter account sprouted up under the handle @_BostonMarathon. Posing as the organizers of the race, whoever is behind the account tweeted: ""For every retweet we receive we will donate $1 to the #BostonMarathon victims #PrayForBoston."" By Monday evening, the post had been retweeted more than 50,000 times. It was, of course, fake. And to its credit, Twitter disabled the account soon afterward. It wasn't the only Twitter phony. Another widely talked-about account, @Hope4Boston, shared both the image of the 8-year-old girl who supposedly died and a photo of a young boy, running in a race, who was another supposed victim. Eight-year-old Martin Richard was one of three confirmed fatalities as of Tuesday morning. But he was watching the race, not running in it. The ""Hope for Boston"" account was created on March 24, according to the Web tool When Did You Join Twitter? But account holders are able to change their handles and names on the site. Authorities shut down cell phone service . Reports flew around social media, mainly Twitter, on Monday that police in Boston had shut down cellular networks to prevent an attacker from using a cell phone to detonate another explosive. At least one media report quoted an unnamed source with information to that effect, before later recanting. In truth, Boston's wireless network was simply overwhelmed with the volume of calls and other communications in the aftermath of the attack. Service was slow and spotty, but never shut down. Verizon and other mobile carriers confirmed they'd never been contacted by officials asking them to shut off service. Soon after the bombings, mobile carriers were beefing up their networks in the Boston area. AT&T made its Wi-Fi system publicly available for free to help take the load off traditional phone lines. Conspiracy theories . We almost hate to even address this stuff. We'll start with a bottom line: Anyone saying they know what happened at this point is making it up. But that didn't stop far-fetched imaginings, often based in political ideology, from flying almost immediately after the attack. One syndicated talk show host (who won't be named and whose content won't be linked here) tweeted that the attacks ""stink to high heaven"" of a so-called ""false flag,"" or staged attack. ""False flag"" is an old naval term that's come to be used for a military action that's not what it appears to be. At least one Web user was ready for this. He registered a website -- bostonmarathonconspiracy.com -- on Monday. Clicking the link reveals a white page with black text reading: . ""I bought this domain to keep some conspiracy theory kook from owning it. Please keep the victims of this event and their families in your thoughts. Thank you.""","On social media, untrue stories about the Boston terror attacks have gone viral quickly .

"China's former top domestic security official, Zhou Yongkang, has been arrested as part of a corruption probe, the country's state-run Xinhua news agency reports. Zhou -- who had been one of nine members of China's top decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee, before stepping down in late 2012 -- was also expelled from the Communist Party, according to Xinhua, citing a decision made Friday at a meeting of the party central committee's political bureau. The decision comes amid a much touted anti-corruption campaign launched by President Xi Jinping, one that has already ensnared several men who had once been prominent figures in government and the ruling Communist Party. Corruption is a lightning rod for public discontent across the Asian nation, which for decades has been run by the Communist Party. After taking power in late 2012, Xi banned official extravagance -- from banquets to year-end gifts -- and vowed to target ""flies and tigers"" alike in his fight against corruption when describing his resolve to spare no one, regardless of position. One of them was Gen. Xu Caihou, a former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, which runs the world's largest standing army. Xu was expelled from the party and handed over to prosecutors after being found to have accepted bribes, Xinhua reported in June. Like Zhou, Xu was in the Politburo before retiring in 2012. Also this summer, Xinhua reported on the downfall of Su Rong, a former vice chairman of China's top political advisory body. State media reported that Su and his wife profited tremendously through bribes and illegal land deals when he ran the southeastern province of Jiangxi. Zhou officially got caught up in this campaign in July, when the Communist Party announced it was opening a probe into the retired senior leader for a suspected if then unspecified ""serious disciplinary violation."" According to a statement released Saturday by the Supreme People's Procuratorate, or China's prosecutor's office, an investigation determined that Zhou took advantage of his positions to garner profits for others ""and accepted huge bribes personally and through his family,"" Xinhua reported. He did so to help relatives, mistresses and friends, leaking party and country secrets while hurting state-owned assets, according to Xinhua. The same report noted that investigators found that Zhou had affairs with a number of women, trading ""his power for sex and money."" ""What Zhou did completely deviated from the (Communist) Party's nature and mission, and seriously violated Party discipline,"" Xinhua said, citing the statement from the procuratorate. His behavior ""badly undermined the reputation of the Party, significantly damaged the cause of the Party and the people and have yielded serious consequences.""","Zhou Yongkang had been one of nine on China's top decision-making body .

"Two years ago, an 8.9-magnitude earthquake generated a tsunami of historic proportions that waylaid Japan's northeast coastline, including a nuclear power plant. As Fukushima Daiichi unraveled in global public view with fire, explosions and radioactive emissions for weeks, people living nearby were exposed to radiation and trauma. The trauma was worse, the World Health Organization said in a report released Thursday on the health effects of the ""Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami."" The lifetime risk of contracting certain types of cancer rose slightly for a small group of people because they were exposed to radiation from the nuclear disaster, the WHO said Thursday. The notable exception was young emergency workers at the plant, who inhaled high doses of radioactive iodine, probably raising their risk of developing thyroid cancer. But since the thyroid is relatively resistant to cancer, the overall risk for these people remains low, the report said. Otherwise, any increase in human disease after the partial meltdown triggered by the March 2011 tsunami is ""likely to remain below detectable levels,"" the WHO said in its report. People exposed as children in towns close to the Daiichi power plant are slightly more likely to contract leukemia, breast or thyroid cancer in the course of their lives than the general population, the WHO said. The power plant deteriorated into a level 7 disaster, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the most dangerous ranking on its scale. It was the worst disaster since the 1986 nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl in the Ukraine. But the gradual unfolding of the calamity gave Japanese authorities time to evacuate many potential victims. The destruction from the tsunami also caused people to flee before the plant began to break down. The woman powering Japan's nuclear hopes post-Fukushima . High psychological damage . The WHO report highlights the psychological effects of disaster -- fear, anxiety and depression, possibly to the point of psychosomatic illness and psychiatric disorders. Radiation emergencies can exacerbate these, the WHO said, because radiation is invisible, and people have a hard time understanding it and the magnitude -- whether large or small -- of its effects. Whole nations may stigmatize people hailing from affected areas, making life harder on them if they move, the WHO said. Opinion: What Japanese leaders can learn from Fukushima . Stories of hardship . A local woman in her late 80s, whom researchers interviewed for the report, was unconcerned about radiation exposure. ""For generations, my family has lived in a close relationship with this land,"" she told them. ""I will feel accursed for losing the lands that my ancestors passed down to me."" The village of Iitate in Japan's Fukushima prefecture was once home to 6,000 people. Plant operator: We weren't prepared . Today, however, it is essentially a ghost town, evacuated after the nuclear accident just 25 miles (40 kilometers) away. For elderly couple Yukio and Masayo Nakano, life has not been easy. Yukio had lived in his home in the village for more than 60 years, moving in just after World War II. ""I can't describe it. It's hard living in the temporary housing, and it's very stressful mentally,"" he said. The difficult situation has also taken its toll on his wife, Masayo. ""I'm lonely. We're getting old,"" she said. ""I think every day how long I can survive in this situation."" The earthquake, tsunami and nuclear calamity have presented the population with three disasters at once, not to mention Japan's economic doldrums. The WHO warns that the sum of these may give rise to complicated health problems. U.S. Navy sailors sue Japan over nuclear accident . Direct radiation exposure . Those living in hardest-hit areas of Fukushima prefecture were exposed to radiation levels of 12 to 25 milliseverts (mSv) in the first year since the disaster, the WHO reported. That's equivalent to one or two CAT scans, according to the American College of Radiology. Even on the upper end of the scale, that barely raises the risk of dying from cancer, the college says. According to United Nations nuclear experts, exposure to less than 1,000 mSv annually causes no meaningful increase in the risk of getting cancer. Husband of Fukushima suicide victim demands justice . Smoking is much more likely to. And coal-fired power plants kill more people than their nuclear counterparts do, according to the Clean Air Task Force. Resulting air pollution was expected to cause nearly 13,200 deaths in 2010, not to mention 20,000 heart attacks per year. Radiation occurs naturally.  We are exposed to it through some minerals and from the sun. ""The average person in the U.S. receives an effective dose of about 3 mSv per year,"" the American College of Radiology says. The rest of Fukushima prefecture saw 3 to 5 mSv in the first year, the equivalent of an X-ray. Trying to revive a Fukushima 'ghost town' Discomforting signs . Although that may be less upsetting to know, after the Daiichi catastrophe, there have been discomforting signs -- and wonders. Scientist found butterflies with a variety of mutations in Fukushima prefecture and beyond. Radioactive iodine poured into the ocean at the reactor site, spiking at 1,250 times normal levels. Offshore monitoring stations also detected high levels of cesium, a radioactive element. More than a year after the disaster, fish caught off the coast of Fukushima exhibited levels of cesium up to 250 times the amount the Japanese government approves for consumption. Isolated tests have revealed higher than normal concentrations of radioactive elements in other agricultural products in surrounding areas in the past. Though the WHO sees no significant danger of radioactivity in the food chain raising the cancer risk, who wants to be the unlucky person to eat the wrong fish? And although the cancer risk has risen only slightly in a very small area, this will be little comfort to the few additional people who get cancer after having been exposed to radiation near the Daiichi plant as little girls or young men. The WHO's report stresses that although its research has been thorough, the final effects of the radiation disaster won't be known until sometime in the future, when scientists will have the benefit of hindsight. It's 20/20. Radioactive levels staying high off Fukushima Daiichi .","March 11 is the second anniversary of the great quake and tsunami .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A crash involving two trains in central Indonesia Saturday killed 36 people and injured 26, officials said. The crash occurred when a train traveling from Semarang in Central Java to the capital of Jakarta was struck from behind by another train headed to Jakarta from Surabaya in East Java, according to Bambang Ervan, transport ministry spokesman. Four coaches have been lifted off the track, and one remains, said Sugeng Priyono, spokesman for the Indonesian railway company. Many people were crushed in the last carriage of the first train, which was stationary when the other train slammed into it, survivors said. ""Suddenly I heard a very loud sound from behind,"" said Anwar Riksono, a passenger who was sleeping when the trains crashed. ""It shook so hard and the lights went off."" A crane lifted away large pieces of the train, mangled beyond recognition.

"Washington (CNN) -- With a rapidly deteriorating situation on the streets of Cairo, the U.S. State Department is urging Americans who want help getting out of Egypt to ""take advantage of U.S. government charter flights while they are available."" ""As you know, we cannot demand that an American leave, however, we certainly push for them to leave,"" said a senior State Department official, who spoke on background because he was not authorized to use his name. According to the official, the State Department is cutting back on the number of flights Thursday because some of those charters have been leaving with empty seats. On Thursday morning, one flight was fully booked and boarded, and takeoff was imminent, he said. An additional flight was on the ground, the official said, ""but isn't even near halfway full."" About 3,000 Americans have registered to be evacuated. So far, 2,000 have been flown out on U.S. government charters to European locations. Since Monday, the State Department has been running an average of four flights a day. Depending upon demand, more flights could be added, but the official said if circumstances suddenly got worse, they might have to order charters from other cities in the region and that could take time. The State Department is urging U.S. citizens who want to leave to come to Cairo International Airport as soon as possible. They should bring travel documents with them, but even citizens who have passports that expired up to 10 years ago can come, and U.S. consular officials will assist them. Commercial flights from Cairo still are operating, and many Americans, according to the State Department, have already left via commercial airlines, private airlines and other governments' chartered flights. At last report, the Cairo airport terminal is relatively orderly, according to the department. It continues to assess whether or not flights will operate Friday and possibly Saturday.","The State Department is urging Americans to leave Egypt .

"Sen. Rand Paul is blaming politicians for the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, arguing that the criminal justice system fuels racial tension by disproportionately targeting African-Americans. The so-called war on drugs has created a culture of violence and put police in a nearly impossible situation,"" Paul said in an op-ed published for TIME. He acknowledged that the shooting death of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer wasn't related to drugs, but argued that outsized penalties for nonviolent drug crimes creates a ""tension in some communities that too often results in tragedy."" The comments are another attempt by Paul, a Kentucky Republican and likely 2016 presidential contender, to seize on the violence in Ferguson as an opportunity to make inroads with minorities. He's blending his libertarian-leaning views about the war on drugs with a message that emphasizes the importance of individual responsibility. And he's doing this while other possible GOP presidential prospects -- like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- are largely silent on the turmoil unfolding in Ferguson. Back in August, as violence first unfolded on the streets of Ferguson, Paul made a splash with an op-ed  -- also in TIME -- blasting the government for over-militarizing local police forces. The piece made him one of the few political voices willing to weigh in on the issue at the time. Paul didn't address police forces in Tuesday's op-ed, and he also refrained from addressing the grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson. Rather, he focused his opinion piece on broader issues that cause what he frequently describes as an ""undercurrent of unease"" in poor communities. While he said criminal justice reform is a crucial need, he ultimately argued it's up to individuals themselves to improve their lives. Saying he has ""no intention to scold,"" Paul stressed that escaping the ""poverty trap will require all of us to relearn that not only are we our brother's keeper, we are our own keeper."" Obama: 'No sympathy' for violence in Ferguson . ""While a hand-up can be part of the plan, if the plan doesn't include the self-discovery of education, work, and the self-esteem that comes with work, the cycle of poverty will continue,"" he continued. His hope, he concluded, is that a non-political leader will emerge ""who motivates and inspires all of us to discover traits, ambitions, and moral codes that have slowly eroded and left us empty with despair."" Paul's critics, however, have consistently questioned the senator's libertarian views that have put him in hot water in the past, such as his doubts about a provision of the Civil Rights Act involving property rights and discrimination. He's tried to sell his overall nontraditional ideology to wider audiences, and trumpet his efforts in doing so. In the past year, he's spoken at the National Urban League and addressed historically black colleges. He's also helped the GOP open up an office in Detroit, and he was there for the Kentucky GOP's office opening in urban Louisville. Paul visited Ferguson last month to meet with NAACP leaders, and told CNN later in the day that the GOP's ""biggest mistake"" in the past few decades has been not competing for African Americans' votes. He made headlines last week for meeting with Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader and controversial figure who says he considers Paul a competitive threat for Democrats in 2016. On the legislative side, Paul has made proposals in the Senate that would restore voting rights to felons with nonviolent drug convictions and would reform the criminal justice system to lower penalties for similar convictions. Rand Paul and his Democratic buds . Paul's minority outreach efforts have certainly earned him plenty of media attention and accolades by some in African-American communities, but others say it's not enough. Rep. Barbara Lee argued Paul's attempts to court African American voters are ""welcome"" endeavors, but he'll ""need to do a much better job if he actually expects to win them."" In an opinion piece Monday for The Root, the Democratic congresswoman from California harpooned Paul for saying last week in an interview that there's been no ""bigger defender of minority rights in the Congress"" than himself. King to Obama: Invite Wilson to White House . It's a comment Paul has made repeatedly this year, and it always lands him in trouble with critics who point to sitting Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights icon who spoke at the 1963 March on Washington among other key events. But Lee, in her op-ed, described Paul's legislative pushes involving drug sentencing reform as ""low-hanging fruit"" and blasted Paul for failing to ""corral any significant support from his Republican colleagues."" ""Doing the bare minimum, though, doesn't make you a hero,"" she wrote. ""Nor do you get much credit just for showing up."" Sharpton, however, appears to think Paul is making inroads with African-Americans. Following their meeting last week, he argued that Paul may not necessarily generate a lot of support among black voters, but his outreach may stop them from voting against him if he becomes the GOP nominee. This, he told Politico, could be bad for Democratic turnout. ""If he's able to neutralize his past image on civil rights, if he becomes the candidate ... and if you don't get a huge black turnout saying 'We're afraid [of him],'"" that could be a pitfall for Democrats. ""I think he knows it's unlikely someone like Al Sharpton would endorse him, but I can't ignore him,"" he added. ""He's openly dealing with issues that [politicians] including people in the Democratic Party, haven't done.""

"A small wooden boat found off the western island of Sado in Japan contained decomposing bodies, according to local police. The boat was badly damaged and contained faint markings on the side that appeared to be Korean characters, according to the Sado West Police. But the characters were so faint that they could not read it clearly, said Toshiyuki Kojima, deputy chief of Sado Nishi Police Station. The boat was discovered early morning Wednesday, drifting into a rocky part of the coast at Mano Bay in Sado City. Authorities did not know how long the boat had been there. Police would not say exactly how many bodies were found on the boat, but said that some bodies had decomposed to the point where only skeletons remained. Local Japanese media reported five bodies were found. Last September, a group of nine North Koreans sailed to Japan and was discovered drifting about 15 miles off the coast of Noto peninsula. They resettled in South Korea. While it's rare for North Korean defectors to sail to Japan, in 2006, four North Koreans floated to northern Japan. In 1987, a family of 11 drifted from North Korea  to west Japan.","Wooden boat found drifting off western side of Japan .

"Sorry, no Chinese researchers allowed! Oh wait, seems like that was a misunderstanding. Please do come. NASA's management apparently misinterpreted a security law when it barred Chinese researchers from attending the space agency's Kepler Science Conference in November, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Sunday. Xinhua said NASA sent a letter to Chinese scientists inviting them back and cited excerpts from the letter. NASA did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Sunday morning. The confusion apparently stemmed from a U.S. law passed in 2011 that prevents NASA funds from being used to collaborate with China or to host Chinese visitors at its facilities. NASA had announced that Chinese nationals would not be allowed to attend the conference for NASA's Kepler space telescope program at the Ames Research Center due to national security. The space telescope has been searching for planets outside of our solar system. Earlier this month, China slammed NASA for its decision to ban Chinese scholars from the conference, calling it ""discriminatory."" Gong Li, an official with the Party School of the China Central Committee's  Communist party, said the ban was similar to previous U.S. action against the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. He said it also illustrated U.S. fear of China's fast development. NASA didn't release an official statement on its website due to the U.S. government's partial shutdown earlier this month. But some U.S. scientists joined in decrying the decision and called for a boycott of the conference. ""In good conscience, I cannot attend a meeting that discriminates in this way. The meeting is about planets located trillions of miles away, with no national security implications,"" Geoff Marcy, an astronomy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an e-mail to the organizers. 'Inaccuracies' U.S. Republican Rep. Frank Wolf, who drafted the 2011 law, issued a statement on his website that sought to correct ""inaccuracies"" about the restrictions first reported by Britain's Guardian newspaper. ""I was concerned to read an October 4 article in The Guardian that reported on poor guidance about these policies with regard to restrictions on Chinese nationals attending a conference next month at NASA Ames Research Center. Unfortunately, the article is riddled with inaccuracies, as is, it appears, the guidance provided by NASA Ames staff to the attendees,"" Wolf wrote. ""As you know, the congressional provision -- which has been in place since early 2011 -- primarily restricts bilateral, not multilateral, meetings and activities with the Communist Chinese government or Chinese-owned companies. It places no restrictions on activities involving individual Chinese nationals unless those nationals are acting as official representatives of the Chinese government."" Security fears . Wolf said NASA officials may have believed the decision was needed because of extra temporary restrictions on foreign nationals after a potential security breach by a Chinese citizen at a NASA facility earlier this year. In March this year, a Chinese aerospace contractor who worked for NASA was arrested at Washington's Dulles International Airport as he boarded a flight to Beijing. Bo Jiang, who worked at NASA's Langley's Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, was charged with making false statements to U.S. authorities by failing to disclose all of the electronic devices he was carrying on his one-way flight. Wolf, who oversees congressional funding of several agencies, told reporters in March he believed Jiang was spying and had access to highly sensitive documents, including source codes for high-tech imaging used in missiles, unmanned aerospace equipment and other technology desired by the Chinese government.","NASA had barred from Chinese researchers from next month's Kepler science conference .

"Save the date: Iran has pledged to start eliminating some of its uranium stockpile on January 20, the White House said Sunday. That gives an official start time for the six-month interim deal with Iran, which was first announced in November. ""As of that day, for the first time in almost a decade, Iran's nuclear program will not be able to advance, and parts of it will be rolled back, while we start negotiating a comprehensive agreement to address the international community's concerns about Iran's program,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement Sunday. Iranian officials also confirmed the start date for the deal, state media reported. As part of the agreement, Iran has agreed to start eliminating its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium, to dismantle some infrastructure that makes higher-level uranium enrichment possible, and not to start up additional centrifuges. Representatives from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency will also monitor Iran's nuclear facilities and make sure the country is taking the required steps as part of the deal. In exchange, some sanctions against Iran will be eased as part of what the White House calls ""modest relief."" U.S. officials estimate the overall sanctions relief provided to Iran as part of the deal will total around $7 billion -- $4.2 billion of which consists of restricted Iranian assets that will be freed up gradually. ""The $4.2 billion in restricted Iranian assets that Iran will gain access to as part of the agreement will be released in regular installments throughout the six months,"" Kerry said. ""The final installment will not be available to Iran until the very last day."" But there's a bipartisan push in Congress to tighten, rather than ease, sanctions on Iran. U.S. President Barack Obama made it clear Sunday that he would push back. ""Imposing additional sanctions now will only risk derailing our efforts to resolve this issue peacefully, and I will veto any legislation enacting new sanctions during the negotiation,"" Obama said in a written statement. Senior Obama administration officials echoed that sentiment Sunday, but also said if Iran doesn't make good on its promises, the United States could decide to step up sanctions. Iranian lawmakers have threatened to boost uranium enrichment levels if the United States imposes more sanctions against the country. One of Iran's deputy foreign minister, Majid Ravanchi, told CNN Sunday that the enactment of additional sanctions from the U.S. Senate would ""ruin the entire agreement."" ""We hope we will not face that,"" he said. Word of the deal's start date drew mixed reactions from Capitol Hill Sunday. ""I'm concerned that this agreement takes us down that path where sanctions pressure is relieved, but Iran maintains its ability to produce a nuclear weapon,"" said House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman  Rep. Ed Royce, R-California. ""Given these stakes, it's regrettable that the President does not want to work with Congress to bolster his negotiating hand with additional sanctions, which would go into effect should Iran fail to meet its commitments."" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, called the interim agreement a ""meaningful step forward"" and said new sanctions would be counterproductive. ""We will know soon enough if Iran is committed to a diplomatic resolution of its nuclear program. If it is not, new sanctions will move with lightning speed out of the Congress and with my full support."" he said. ""Many obstacles remain, and I continue to be skeptical of Tehran's willingness to abandon pursuit of nuclear weapons technology, but I am also fully convinced that we must try the diplomatic path."" The agreement struck in November with representatives from Iran, the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany has been widely hailed as a successful interim measure to stave off an unwanted conflict over Tehran's nuclear program. But after initially celebrating a diplomatic success, Iran had reportedly lashed out at the United States for making public a modified version of the agreement that Tehran said did not reflect its interpretation. It took three rounds of meetings with technical experts to hammer out the details of implementing the deal, European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton said in a statement Sunday. Another Iranian deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, announced the deal's start date at a press conference Sunday, saying that his country would stop 20% uranium enrichment at that time, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported. ""There's $4.2 billion of Iran's oil income which will be released, and from the other side, the conversion of 20% enriched material to oxide or diluting it (will) be carried out. This action on our side, and that one on theirs, will be performed within a six-month span,"" he said. Even as they hailed the start date as a significant step forward Sunday, officials cautioned that the toughest negotiations are yet to come. ""The negotiations will be very difficult,"" Kerry said, ""but they are the best chance we have to be able to resolve this critical national security issue peacefully, and durably.""","Iranian official: New sanctions would ""ruin the entire agreement""

"Libya's justice minister held a ""cordial"" meeting with U.S. Ambassador Deborah Jones on the capture of alleged al Qaeda operative Abu Anas al Libi by American forces over the weekend in Tripoli, two senior State Department officials said Tuesday. The session was ""all very cordial albeit with concerns,"" one of the officials said. The meeting had previously been described as a ""summoning,"" a more formal diplomatic term frequently used when one country wants to express displeasure with another. Libya's General National Congress on Tuesday demanded that U.S. officials hand over al Libi, spokesman Omar Hmidan said. He also demanded that Libyan authorities and al Libi's family have access to him in the meantime. The developments come as 200 heavily armed U.S. Marines headed to an Italian naval base, poised to fly at a moment's notice to Libya should the U.S. Embassy come under assault from angry crowds in the wake of al Libi's capture. U.S. Army Delta Force soldiers captured al Libi this weekend in Tripoli. He is accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. The deployment, which began Monday, was made in coordination with the State Department, a military official told CNN. The official called the move a ""prudent measure"" after the U.S. military raid to capture al Libi. The Marines are part of a 500-member unit formed after the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi that left Ambassador Christopher Stevens and two other U.S. citizens dead. Military forces were not close enough to respond to that attack. The official said they were being moved along with three V-22 Osprey aircraft capable of delivering them and their supplies to Libya, which lies about 328 miles (528 kilometers) across the Mediterranean Sea. What the terror raids say about an 'Obama Doctrine' Al Libi Interrogation . On Monday, al Libi was on a U.S. Navy warship, where he was being questioned by a high-value detainee interrogation group -- an FBI-led team with intelligence experts from the CIA and other agencies -- which is determining whether he has information about al Qaeda operations, future attacks or the whereabouts of known associates, U.S. officials have said. A Defense Department statement says he is being held ""lawfully under the law of war in a secure location outside of Libya."" It is unclear how long he will be interrogated, but U.S. officials have said he will be transferred to New York for trial. The 49-year-old alleged al Qaeda operative is accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people and wounded about 4,000 more. He was indicted in the Southern District of New York in the embassy bombings and in connection with his alleged roles in al Qaeda conspiracies to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia. Wife: al Libi no longer with al Qaeda . Civilian trial . President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have previously said they prefer to try individuals such as al Libi in American courts. Al Libi isn't on alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's level, so don't expect the same hullabaloo over U.S. plans to try the Libyan terror suspect on American soil, legal experts said Monday. ""He will be brought back to the United States and tried in a federal criminal courtroom,"" CNN senior analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""Obama's trying to close Guantanamo, not add prisoners."" And unlike previous cases, such as Mohammed's, ""I really don't think there's going to be too much protest or concern or worry if they proceed that way,"" said James Forest, a professor and the director of security studies at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. ""I honestly don't think he has the name-brand recognition, shall we say, of a Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,"" Forest said. In the past, terrorism suspects captured on American soil generally have been tried in federal courts -- such as Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab, the would-be ""undiebomber"" who tried unsuccessfully to set off a bomb on a U.S.-bound jetliner in 2009; attempted Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad; or 9/11 co-conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui. It's ""murky territory"" when a fugitive is nabbed overseas by American forces, said Forest, a former director of terrorism studies at West Point. But ""my hunch is they'll probably go the criminal route."" When the White House in 2009 proposed trying Mohammed and four other 9/11 suspects in Manhattan, the plan was met with staunch criticism from Republican leaders who said such a trial would be costly and asserted that the five terror suspects -- none of whom was an American citizen -- didn't deserve the rights and protections civilian courts afford defendants. In 2011, Holder begrudgingly announced that the five suspected conspirators' fates would be decided via military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prompting backlash from Democrats and human rights groups who painted the tribunals as untested, flawed and the likely subject of numerous legal challenges. ""Had this case proceeded in Manhattan or in an alternative venue in the United States, as I seriously explored in the past year, I am confident that our justice system would have performed with the same distinction that has been its hallmark for over 200 years,"" Holder said at the time. Al Libi's case should not raise the same issues, Toobin said, because, as the suspected 9/11 mastermind, Mohammed was ""in a separate category from everyone else in the world."" While the United States considers al Libi a dangerous terrorist, neither he nor his crimes are as well-known as Mohammed's, Toobin said. As for al Libi's interrogation, Toobin noted that there is no indication he is being tortured and that if al Libi were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques, the U.S. government has been clear that ""they will not use the results of torture like waterboarding in any criminal case."" ""The government obviously believes he's a very dangerous person, captured in a dangerous part of the world, and he needs to be isolated and brought back to the United States,"" Toobin said. But Forest questioned how much valuable intelligence al Libi would be able to provide his captors. A former jihadist associate told CNN it was unlikely that he was still playing an active role with the terrorist network, and his wife said he had been living a normal life and was seeking a job with the Libyan oil ministry. ""Who knows if he's really up to speed on anything useful these days?"" Forest asked. Opinion: Good thing U.S. terrorist hunters weren't furloughed .","Libya's General National Congress demands return of al Libi, spokesman says .

"What do you need to map a billion stars? A billion-pixel camera certainly helps. Scientists hope to glean more clues about the origin and evolution of the universe, and in particular our own galaxy, after a camera of this incredible scale -- fitted to the Gaia space telescope -- was launched Thursday. Gaia, which lifted off from French Guiana, has been tasked with mapping the Milky Way in greater detail than ever before. Designed and built by Astrium for the European Space Agency (ESA), the makers say the telescope is so sensitive that it could measure a person's thumbnail from the Moon, or to put it another way, detect the width of a human hair from 1,000km (620 miles) away. The mission's aim is to build a three-dimensional picture of our galaxy, measuring precise distances to a billion stars. Even this is a small fraction of the Milky Way, as astronomers believe there are at least 100 billion stars in our galaxy. Tens of billions like Earth, study says . Astrium says Gaia is also expected to log a million quasars beyond the Milky Way, and a quarter of a million objects in our own solar system, including comets and asteroids. ""It can do it with incredible accuracy. It's the biggest camera ever put into space,"" said Ralph Cordey, head of science and exploration at Astrium. He said the spacecraft cost 400 million euros ($549 million) to build, but the total cost of the mission would come to 740 million euros ($1.02 billion) when the expense of the launch and running the mission for its projected five-year lifetime are included. If successful, Gaia will add to the knowledge gained from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, which is still in operation, and ESA's Hipparcos satellite, which gathered data until 1993. Hubble spots azure planet where it may rain glass . The value of putting a billion-pixel camera into space has been championed by Robert Massey from the UK's Royal Astronomical Society. ""Gaia is an amazingly ambitious mission,"" he said. ""Until now astronomers have relied on very indirect methods to gauge the distance to all but the nearest stars, meaning that the foundation on which we build a map of the universe is surprisingly weak. ""Building on the work of the pioneering Hipparcos satellite that mapped the stellar neighbourhood in the 1990s, Gaia will be used to carry out work analogous to the cartographers who surveyed the Earth in the 19th and 20th centuries, building up the first accurate charts of the cosmos and helping us better understand the structure, history and fate of the galaxy we live in."" One of Gaia's objectives is to help in the hunt for exoplanets -- new worlds beyond our own solar system. NASA's Kepler mission has so far confirmed the existence of 167 exoplanets with hundreds more being investigated, but Cordey anticipates Gaia will likely discover thousands of new planets, while further missions will be able to uncover more detail about them. In a recent interview with CNN, George Whitesides, CEO of Virgin Galactic -- the company planning to take tourists into space -- said he thought that within a lifetime it would be possible to detect seasons on far-off worlds. He may have not have too long to wait, as Astrium is already working on design concepts to examine exoplanet atmospheres -- which may provide signs of seasonal variations. ""We are designing missions that could probably do that very thing -- it's not science fiction,"" said Cordey.

"Hours before the Senate votes on whether to arm Syrian rebels to fight ISIS, a thinly veiled smackdown broke out on Thursday between Sens. Rand Paul and John McCain about the issue. It was the latest episode in a public feud that has implications over the future of the Republican Party. Paul railed against the notion that arming Syrian rebels is going to be an effective tactic to fight ISIS, lambasting what he called ""barnacled enablers"" for pushing a policy that he said will harm American interests in the long run. ""They've never met a war they didn't like,"" Paul said on the Senate floor Thursday of the ""Washington crowd"" without naming names. Paul has been embroiled in a bitter debate within his party over foreign policy, especially with McCain. The debate between the two has become personal as McCain has labeled Paul an isolationist and as having a ""fundamental lack of understanding"" of international threats. Why Rand Paul can't shake isolationist image . Paul, who is considering a presidential run, did not mention McCain's name, but references to the long-time Arizona Senator were peppered throughout. ""What we have here is a failure to understand,"" Paul said, that ""intervention creates chaos."" In a very thinly veiled swipe, Paul once again brought up a debunked report that McCain took pictures with members of ISIS before he completely understood the dynamics of the group. ""To those who wish unlimited intervention and boots on the ground everywhere, remember the smiling poses of politicians pontificating about so-called freedom fighters and heroes in Libya, in Syria and Iraq unaware of that the so-called freedom fighters may well have been allied with kidnappers and killers and jihadists,"" Paul said. Paul says that arming Syrians before we have a complete understanding of who they are and where their alliances align is dangerous. ""It's absurd,"" Paul said of the policy. ""We shouldn't be fighting alongside jihadists."" Moments after Paul finished his speech, McCain took to the microphone and pushed back against that argument, insisting moderate fighters do exist in Syria. ""What's their solution?"" McCain rhetorically asked opponents, including Paul. This is Paul's question: ""When will we quit listening to the advocates who have been wrong about every foreign policy position of the last two decades?"" The Senate is voting on a government spending package to fund the government and in it is a measure to allow arming and training Syrian rebels.","Sen.

"SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Relentless wildfires roared through Southern California for a third day Tuesday, sending more than half a million residents fleeing with family members, pets and whatever prize possessions they could fit in their vehicles. The blazes have charred 400,000 acres and reduced 1,300 homes -- 1,000 in San Diego County -- to ash. The fires have killed one person and injured more than 50. Earlier Tuesday, officials erroneously reported that a second person had died. Earlier Tuesday, Lt. Gov. John Garamendi, said the number of evacuees ""could very well approach 500,000 by the end of the day."" By Tuesday night, officials had evacuated nearly 350,000 homes in San Diego County. Using U.S. Census Bureau numbers from the 2000 census, that could mean as many as 950,000 were affected by the fires. In San Diego County, at least 513,000 residents had been ordered to find refuge in shelters, schools and stadiums as fires pushed into new areas. Twelve thousand more people were advised but not ordered to evacuate.  Watch a fire official describe ""utter devastation"" Â» . President Bush will visit the area Thursday, the White House said. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff arrived in San Diego on Tuesday afternoon. Chertoff promised a different federal reaction from the one in New Orleans in 2005. ""We have been preparing and planning and training together for the last 2Â½ years,"" he said. And the scene at Qualcomm Stadium on Tuesday did seem to live up to Chertoff's expectations as volunteers cheerily handed out chairs, food and water. The Federal Emergency Management Agency delivered 25,000 cots early Tuesday.  Watch report of a man who fled fire in Chula Vista Â» . Free newspapers were available, National Guard troops kept watch, ventriloquists and balloon artists entertained kids, and even massage therapists were trying to help the 12,000 to 15,000 evacuees relax as they fretted about the fate of their homes.  Watch evacuees try to pass the time as they worry about their homes Â» . Meanwhile, at least two fires raged on the property of the U.S. Marines' Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego. Three-thousand Marines were evacuated Tuesday evening. Paul McHale, assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense, said 550 Camp Pendleton Marines were preparing to deploy to the fire area. As the Santa Ana winds, which approached 70 mph, fueled the fires, 1,400 Navy personnel and their families were evacuated, the Pentagon said.  See photos of the fires Â» . And in an effort to make room for more civilians who have had to evacuate their homes, sailors stationed in Southern California are abandoning their barracks. McHale said that a dozen Defense Department firefighting teams, with 12 engines, were already working the blazes, and more than 17,000 National Guardsmen are potentially available if needed. The Pentagon has provided 11 helicopters equipped with water buckets to fight the fires, he said. But aerial attacks on the fires have been minimal because of the fierce Santa Ana winds. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has already called up 1,500 National Guard troops, including more than 200 taken from border duty to help with supplies and security at Qualcomm Stadium and DelMar Fairgrounds and Racetrack, where thousands of evacuated residents are taking shelter. Eighteen firefighters have been injured in the blazes, according to Schwarzenegger, who said Tuesday that he was ""heartbroken"" after touring the Lake Arrowhead area where the Grass Valley and Slide fires have burned 5,000 acres and destroyed more than 200 homes. Lake Arrowhead resident Michelle Dresser, who owns a business and was chased from her home by a wildfire last year, said Tuesday she was waiting until the last minute to leave. She spent the night in her store, partly to help customers and neighbors. ""It is crazy. We are surrounded by fire on both sides,"" she said. Asked by CNN where she would go, she replied, ""I have to find someplace to accept two dogs, two cats and a turtle."" Qualcomm Stadium is accepting animals. New evacuation orders are being added frequently to the San Diego Office of Emergency Services Web site. Officials said the crisis is far from over. ""It will not end ... until it reaches the ocean or the winds turn around,"" San Diego Fire Battalion Chief Bruce Cartelli said Tuesday.  See where fires burn across Southern California Â» . Despite having 21 years of experience as a firefighter, Arthur Jackson marveled at the fires he battled. ""It is just amazing how this fire selects whatever it wants and burns whatever it wants,"" he told CNN. Although they were toiling in 24-hour shifts, Jackson said he and his fellow firefighters were ""holding up pretty good."" What weighed heaviest on them was not so much the physical exertion, he said, but knowing they had failed to protect all of the structures. For some, the failure was more than a professional concern. ""Some of the firefighters -- their own homes have burned up,"" he said.  E-mail to a friend .

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain conceded the presidential race before a crowd of supporters in Phoenix on Tuesday. He also congratulated Sen. Barack Obama. Here is a transcript: . Sen. John McCain concedes defeat in the presidential election to Barack Obama. McCain: Thank you. Thank you, my friends. Thank you for coming here on this beautiful Arizona evening. My friends, we have -- we have come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling Sen. Barack Obama to congratulate him.  Watch McCain's speech Â» . To congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love. In a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving. This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight. I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. Sen. Obama believes that, too. But we both recognize that, though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound. A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt's invitation of Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House was taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and frightful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than the election of an African-American to the presidency of the United States. Let there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth. Sen. Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day. Though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise. Sen. Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country. And I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face. I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited. Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans. And please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that. It is natural. It's natural, tonight, to feel some disappointment. But tomorrow, we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought -- we fought as hard as we could. And though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours. I am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset, but your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you. I'm especially grateful to my wife, Cindy, my children, my dear mother and all my family, and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me. You know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful years ahead. I am also -- I am also, of course, very thankful to Gov. Sarah Palin, one of the best campaigners I've ever seen, and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength, her husband Todd and their five beautiful children for their tireless dedication to our cause, and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to Alaska, the Republican Party and our country. To all my campaign comrades, from Rick Davis and Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter, to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly, month after month, in what at times seemed to be the most challenged campaign in modern times, thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship. I don't know -- I don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been. This campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that Sen. Obama and my old friend Sen. Joe Biden should have the honor of leading us for the next four years. I would not -- I would not be an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today, I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much. And tonight, I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of Arizona for it. Tonight -- tonight, more than any night, I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or Sen. Obama -- whether they supported me or Sen. Obama. I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president. And I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe, always, in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history. Thank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all very much.","McCain: Sen. Obama has achieved a great thing .

"Less than a week after the arson of a mosque in northern Israel, dozens of Christian and Muslim graves were vandalized in an Arab section of the Israeli city of Jaffa. More thahan 100 graves were vandalized in the Muslim cemetery of al-Kazakhana and at a nearby Christian cemetery in the Ajami neighborhood of Jaffa, according to residents and a CNN producer who visited the locations. Some of the graves were spray painted with graffiti while others were smashed. Residents say the vandalism took place Friday evening as the Yom Kippur holiday was beginning in Israel, but police suggested it might have taken place a day or two prior. Among the words spray-painted in Hebrew on the gravestones were ""price tag"" and ""death to all Arabs."" ""Price tag"" is a term frequently used by radical Israeli settlers to denote reprisal attacks against Palestinians in response to moves by the Israeli government to evacuate illegal West Bank outposts, or as retribution for attacks by Palestinians. Local residents told CNN that police who arrived at the scene on Saturday morning tried to cover up the graffiti using white paint. The police also asked locals to clean up the graffiti. ""This is bad, this very, very bad. This is all because of the settlers that moved into the neighborhood. When they did this, the writing was on the wall,"" Jaffa resident Kamel Satal told CNN. He was referring to the opening in 2009, just blocks away in the predominantly Arab neighborhood, of a Hesder Yeshiva, a religious school for young men which traditionally combines Torah studies with military service. ""If they did what they did in Zangaria in Jaffa, there would be big, big problems,"" he added, referring to the mosque that was severely damaged in an suspected arson attack in the Israeli Bedouin village of Tuba Zangaria in northern Israel on Monday. An 18-year-old Jewish Israeli was arrested in connection with the arson. Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said police were investigating the vandalism at the cemeteries. Speaking to the Palestinian Authority run WAFA news agency, Ibrahim Sarsour, an Arab Israeli lawmaker, condemned the vandalism. ""The Israeli government was not making any effort to stop these racist attacks against Palestinians,"" Sarsour said. ""Rather, it provides extremists protection."" According to Israeli police, reprisals have increased in the past year, prompting them to create a special investigative unit. In the past year, four West Bank mosques have been set ablaze. The United Nations has reported a measurable spike in violence against Palestinian property in 2011. On Wednesday, a shrine holy to Jews was desecrated in the West Bank. Jewish worshippers arrived at Joseph's Tomb in the city of Nablus to find swastikas and graffiti sprayed on the walls. It is unclear when the graffiti was left there. The site is under Palestinian Authority rule, and Jews visit every couple of months to pray.","More than 100 graves were vandalized in two cemeteries -- one Christian, one Muslim .

"In ""The Twelve"" it's the end of the world as we know it and while no one feels fine, millions love reading about it. Hitting bookstores October 16, ""The Twelve"" is the highly-anticipated new novel from award-winning author Justin Cronin. It's the second in a planned trilogy about a frightening man-made apocalypse. The first in the series, ""The Passage,"" was an instant bestseller in 2010 winning widespread praise from critics and a worldwide legion of fans. Master of horror Stephen King was among Cronin's most vocal supporters. ""The Passage"" also received national attention for the back story behind the book. Originally inspired by Cronin's then 8-year-old daughter, at its heart it's a story about a little girl who saves the world. The book generated a bidding war among publishers, ultimately selling for more than $3 million. Film rights were also snapped up for a reported seven-figure payday. Cronin went from being a little-known author and English professor to overnight millionaire. In the series, Cronin presents a desolate view of the future, where a mysterious plague turns people into blood-sucking monsters, cities crumble, much of the United States is turned into a wasteland and millions of people die in the resulting chaos. Nevertheless, readers love Cronin's fresh, intelligent combination of science fiction, horror and thriller, reminiscent of King's ""The Stand"" and Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road."" ""The Twelve"" of the title are the dozen vampire-like creatures created in a secret government experiment gone horribly wrong. Now these twelve virals control an army of the undead, out to extinguish what's left of the human race. The new book briefly returns to ""year zero"" of the global plague. It reintroduces readers to some favorite characters from ""The Passage,"" expands the cast, widens the scope of the story and gives the plot a ""1984"" Orwellian twist. CNN recently spoke to Cronin from his home in Houston, Texas, where he's hard at work on the third and final book in the trilogy. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: You've talked about how your daughter was the original inspiration behind ""The Passage."" Did she have any input on your new novel? Cronin: She did at the outset. When she and I conceived the first book we talked about the sequels and their basic narrative shape. So in that sense her handprints are upon it. That said, the 8-year-old girl who took her bike rides with me and talked about the novel is now a 16-year-old learning to drive with her own life and her own concerns and in fact her own writing. So on a day-to-day basis, my go-to person now I would say has been my wife. Whenever I hit a snag, we take a walk around the block and talk about it and rather remarkably by the time we return it's not uncommon for the problem to be solved. So for each book there's been a woman in my life who's played a pretty big role. In this one I'd have to give a tip of the hat to my wife. CNN: When we last talked you said, ""The hazard of most trilogies is the middle book."" So was this novel harder to write than the last? Cronin: It was different. For each book I've had to sit down and look at what new challenges I have to work through. One of the best things about my job is that I don't have a boss, so I can take each project and do what interests me. One of the things I always want to do is never write the same book twice. I want each book to pose a new challenge and force me to stretch as a writer. For this book what I wanted to do was avoid the well-known trap of middle books in a trilogy, which is that they're kind of a long second act, just a bridge between books one and three. What I decided to do was to make sure I wrote a book that had fresh terms established for it, so that it would pick up where the last story left off but it would also reset the situation. Which is why in this book at the start, you go back to year zero to see something you did not see the first time. It changes the rules of the game for my major characters in their quest to rid the world of the great viral plague. That for me was the strategy that I conceived of very early on. What do I want to do in this book that's different from the middle books of most trilogies, in the same way that when I wrote ""The Passage,"" I said what do I want to do that's different from most apocalypse novels? Once I got that clear in my mind I realized how the book would operate. CNN: You've described ""The Passage"" as an ode to ""Lonesome Dove,"" so what novel was your inspiration for ""The Twelve?"" Cronin: For each of the three books I wanted to work within different genres. The first book is a bunch of things. It's a horror novel, apocalyptic fiction, science fiction, but I think it's very much a road novel and a Western. At the core of that novel you have characters who are encountering the American West with the same kind of sense of awe and unknown as the first European settlers. This book, I wanted to draw upon my love of espionage fiction to bring yet another kind of energy into the trilogy. I like really well-written spy novels, for instance I'm a huge fan of Alan Furst. But if I had to pick a book that was really operating in the background it would be George Orwell's ""1984."" It's always been a very important book for me. I wrote my senior thesis in college on ""1984."" I think it's a much more complex and interesting book than its given credit for. How does propaganda operate, how do you gain complicity? I was very interested in these kinds of questions and the psychological mechanics of how totalitarianism operates. In ""The Twelve"" people will see that influence in the background I'm sure. Justin Cronin talks about his new novel, ""The Twelve"" CNN: You're very active on social media. What has your interaction been like with fans online? Cronin: Social media is the perfect thing for writers and for people who work alone. I can't stroll down to the photocopy room and kill a little time chatting about what the Patriots did this weekend. I'm all alone in my office, so it's absolutely a way of breaking the trance of loneliness that writers have to live in. For a writer it gives you the opportunity to interact with your fans without leaving your house or going on a book tour. I love it. The thing about ""The Passage"" trilogy is, unlike my earlier work, those books had readers, but these books have fans. Because the books are still unfolding it's a way to interact with people in the middle of the story. That did not happen with my first two books. Now I hear from people all the time. I love interacting with fans this way. Its fun, it's easy. I think how great it would have been when I was a young reader to be able to do this. John Cheever really made me want to become a writer. I remember a night in college when my roommate and I tried to call him on the phone. It didn't work out, but you really want to talk to these people, they matter to you. Facebook is a way of bridging that gap. I appreciate it not only as a writer but as the reader I was as a young man. CNN: What's the status of book three, any hints? Cronin: I'm sort of at the point now I feel like I'm hitting my stride with the third book. My goal is for the third novel in some ways (is that it) follows the design of the earlier books, which is to briefly take the reader back to year zero. To see yet again something they did not see the first time that resets the terms of the story, so that the book has its own propulsive engine. The only other thing I can say is it's the last book so the big questions that remain will be answered. That's the job of the third book is to end the story. The goal is for the book to come out in 2014, and all mysteries will be revealed.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson criticized Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Tuesday over his reaction to the arrest of six black juveniles in Jena, Louisiana, on murder charges, accusing the Illinois senator of ""acting like he's white,"" according to a South Carolina newspaper. The Rev. Jesse Jackson speaks to the press Tuesday in Jena, Louisiana. The comments reportedly came during a speech at Benedict College, a historically black college in Columbia, South Carolina. The newspaper reports Jackson later said he did not recall saying Obama is ""acting like he's white,"" but continued to condemn the Illinois Democrat as well as the other presidential candidates for not bringing more attention to this issue. He also said Obama needs to be ""bolder"" in his stances if he wants to make inroads in South Carolina. Obama currently trails rival Sen. Hillary Clinton in South Carolina by 18 points, according to a recent LA Times/Bloomberg poll. In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, Obama said his previous statments about the Jena 6 case ""were carefully thought out"" with input from his national campaign chairman and Jackson's son, Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr., D-Illinois. ""Outrage over an injustice like the Jena 6 isn't a matter of black and white. It's a matter of right and wrong,"" he said in the statement. Jackson, who ran for president twice in the 1980s, endorsed Obama's White House bid earlier in the year. Jackson won the South Carolina Democratic primary, where African American voters play an influential role, in both presidential bids. ""If I were a candidate, I'd be all over Jena,"" the prominent civil rights activist said Tuesday in Columbia, South Carolina, the The State newspaper reports. ""Jena is a defining moment, just like Selma was a defining moment."" In a statement released Wednesday, Jackson reaffirmed his support for Obama. ""He has remarkably transcended race, however the impact of Katrina and Jena makes America's unresolved moral dilemma of race unavoidable,"" he said. "" I think Jena is another defining moment of the issue of race and the criminal justice system. This issue requires direct and bold leadership. I commend Sen. Obama for speaking out and demanding fairness on this defining issue. Any attempt to dilute my support for Sen. Obama will not succeed."" Tensions had simmered at Jena High School and in the small town for first three months of the 2006 school year after a black student asked the vice principal if he and some friends could sit under an oak tree where white students typically congregated. Told by the vice principal they could sit wherever they pleased, the student and his pals sat under the sprawling branches of the shade tree in the campus courtyard. The next day, students arrived at school to find three nooses hanging from those branches. According to The Town Talk in nearby Alexandria, the school's principal recommended expulsion for those involved in placing the nooses. Instead, the newspaper reported, a school district committee suspended three white students for three days calling the incident just a ""prank."" On December 4, several students jumped a white classmate, Justin Barker, knocking him unconscious while stomping and kicking him. The charges against the six blacks -- dubbed the "" Jena 6"" -- resulted from that incident. Jackson is slated to be on hand for a march in Jena this Thursday. The Rev. Al Sharpton, Martin Luther King III, and hip-hop artist Mos Def are also expected to be on hand. Obama formally released a statement on the case Friday evening after one of the teen's charges was thrown out, saying, ""I am pleased that the Louisiana state appeals court recognized that the aggravated battery charge brought in this case was inappropriate."" ""I hope that today's decision will lead the prosecutor to reconsider the excessive charges brought against all the teenagers in this case,"" he added. ""And I hope that the judicial process will move deliberately to ensure that all of the defendants will receive a fair trial and equal justice under the law."" He also said in a separate statement last week, ""When nooses are being hung in high schools in the 21st century, it's a tragedy. It shows that we still have a lot of work to do as a nation to heal our racial tensions. This isn't just Jena's problem; it's America's problem."" CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said Obama is under special  pressure because he is the only African-American running for president. But Obama is not of the same generation of black leaders, such as Jackson, who came out of the civil rights moment, Schneider said. ""I think that gives him a special position,"" Schneider said. ""He is running on his appeal -- to white voters as well as to African-American voters -- as a uniter."" ""He doesn't want to be a divider in this case,"" Schneider said. Meanwhile, Obama's chief rivals for the Democratic nomination, Clinton and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, have also recently condemned the Jena case. Sen. Clinton said the controversy surrounding the ""Jena 6"" court case is a ""teachable moment for America."" ""People need to understand that we cannot let this kind of inequality and injustice happen anywhere in America,"" the Democratic presidential hopeful told the Rev. Al Sharpton when she called into his nationally syndicated radio program Tuesday afternoon. At last Saturday's NAACP Freedom Fund Dinner in Charleston South Carolina, Clinton said, ""There is no excuse for the way the legal system treated those young people. ... This case reminds us that the scales of justice are seriously out of balance when it comes to charging, sentencing, and punishing African-Americans."" ""It cries out for a full investigation from the Department of Justice's Civil Rights division."" Edwards released a statement Wednesday morning, saying ""as someone who grew up in the segregated South, I feel a special responsibility to speak out on racial intolerance. Americans of all races are traveling to Jena because they believe that how we respond to the racial tensions in Jena says everything about who we are as a nation."" E-mail to a friend .

"Summer 1938, Europe stands on the brink of war, and Paris is a city on the edge. Nazi spies, shadowy assassins, alluring double agents and a Hollywood movie star caught in the middle stalk the back alleys and bustling bistros of the French capital. This is the setting for Alan Furst's ""Mission to Paris."" The best-selling author has made a career of capturing the classic cloak-and-dagger days leading up to World War II, bringing the era to life like a literary version of ""Casablanca."" In Furst's 12th and newest novel, now in bookstores, Austrian immigrant-turned-Hollywood film star Frederic Stahl arrives in Paris to shoot a movie. The political warfare unit of the Third Reich, the ""Ribbentropburo,"" has other plans. It tries to bully Stahl into becoming its ""agent of influence"" in a growing propaganda war against the French. Stahl, a classic leading man in the mold of Cary Grant, turns the tables, signing on as amateur spy for the United States and taking a dangerous assignment behind enemy lines. From there the action crisscrosses the continent from Berlin to Budapest, briefly visiting Morocco, but the ""City of Light"" remains at the  center of this espionage adventure. Starting with ""Night Soldiers"" in 1988, Furst has achieved international success as the master of the historical spy novel. His 2008 book, ""The Spies of Warsaw,"" is being made into a TV miniseries for the BBC. He appears poised for a repeat of his past success with ""Mission to Paris."" CNN recently spoke to the author by phone from his Long Island, New York, home. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: What led to your fascination with this pre-World War II time period? Alan Furst: In the 1930s there were so many different conflicts going on between the British, the French, the Russians, the Germans, the Spaniards, the Romanians and so on. The intelligence services for all these countries were all battling during what was a very difficult political time. I wanted to read a panoramic spy history of the '30s, and when I went out looking for it, I discovered there was no such thing. I was astonished. So I thought, ""Well, I'll write it."" Where I got the arrogance to do that, I don't know. I couldn't believe no one had written about this. It seemed so exciting and interesting and various. The people who had written about it wrote from such incredibly, violently different angles, whether it was fighting in Spain or street demonstrations in France or the purges in Moscow. There was a lot going on, and all of it in its way was important because the politics of the next century was being sorted out. I thought I'd found gold. CNN: Paris really comes to life in your books; you must have a special affinity for the city. Furst: When I started writing these novels, I was living in Paris in the late 1980s. I do have an affinity for the city as it was in the '30s. It's changed a lot in recent years. I used to have an apartment there. I lived there full time for about eight years. If you live somewhere that long, you really get to know it by osmosis. It really becomes part of you. I love Paris for the million reasons that everybody loves the city. It's an incredibly romantic and beautiful place. I hate to say this, but things have changed in the last three or four years. Notre Dame is white now. They steam cleaned it. Instead of this medieval, sooty, dark, mysterious thing rising into the night sky, now it's kind of a nice limestone cathedral. They've done a lot of stuff like that in Paris now. They don't let you smoke in the cafes anymore -- on and on and on. The Paris of that time period was an incredible place. It was the central city on earth of idealism, of romance, of dreams, of possibilities, of beauty in many ways, of great food, great wine, staying up all night; what could be bad? CNN: All of your books feature a scene at the Brasserie Heininger, a restaurant in Paris. How did you come up with this signature? Furst: It's in every book. The bullet hole in the mirror next to table 14. It's fiction. It's not true. Now there is a brasserie where I say the Brasserie Heininger is in the books. It's called Brasserie Bowfinger, but it looks nothing like the brasserie I describe in the books. Many readers have figured out where it is, and they go there and ask for table 14 and make the maÃ®tre d' mad because there is no table 14, there is no mirror and there's no bullet hole. For me it's a touchstone in my books. I love the story, I repeat it every time, but in every book the characters see it differently. Nobody sees that brasserie the same way. They all have their own opinion. Sometimes it's important to the plot; sometimes it's not. It's like the Parisian moment when a lot of things come together. The way the French and the Parisians like to enjoy themselves. There's no music that plays there. The music is the plates, the clatter of the forks and knives, the talk, laughter, people smoking, perfume; it's a wonderful experience, quite different from eating other places. CNN: A number of your characters resurface from book to book, but you almost always create a new protagonist. Why is that? Furst: This is a series with changing lead characters. What I discovered is I don't like to repeat lead characters because one of the most pleasurable things in a book to me is learning about the lead. Who is he or she? What do they like? How are they going to function in this book? Are they brave or cautious? What's their romantic situation? I think that's a great thing for the reader. I decided that what I had to do in order to get different angles on this material you had to have people in different vocations. So the lead in ""Spies of the Balkans"" is a cop, and he sees things like a policeman sees things. Where as in ""Mission to Paris,"" you have a Hollywood movie actor, an Ã©migrÃ©, and he sees things a completely different way. In an earlier book, you had the French military attachÃ© in Warsaw, and he had his own responsibilities and obligations, and he saw life from that perspective. If you're a writer like I am, it's the best thing because it forces you to work. CNN: What do you want your readers to take away from your novels? Furst: These are novels of consolation. I am not trying to teach anyone a lesson. Now, they happen to be about a certain period in the political history of the West. If something is resonant to you, that's fine. There's plenty that's resonant to me, but I have yet to ever stick my elbow in a reader's ribs and say, ""See that's just like now."" But having said that, there are things that are just like now, and I've got to tell you that ""Mission to Paris"" has an awful lot of just like now. The kind of political warfare they had then is a lot like the kind of political warfare going on now. There's a lot of propaganda, a lot of manipulation, a lot of trying to destroy people's reputations, a lot of lowdown tough stuff. I think most Americans don't like it, but it's the way the game is played, and it hasn't changed. That's the way the game was played in the 1930s. I haven't changed anything, not one thing to make it sound more like what goes on today. I was amazed when I discovered what was going on back then. I didn't know that it went on to that level of sophistication. CNN: You've described your novels as one very long book with 12 chapters to date. How many more books or chapters do you have planned? Furst: Let me put it this way, I don't plan to retire. What would I do, become a brain surgeon? I mean a brain surgeon can retire and write novels, but a novelist can't retire and do brain surgery or at least he better not. I wouldn't know what to do with myself. I'm a writer. I live it and breathe it. God made me this way; it's not my fault! I don't complain too much. Really, I feel very privileged to live the way I do and make a living as I have. Not everybody can do that. Read an excerpt from ""Mission to Paris""","Alan Furst, known as the master of the historical spy novel, has a new thriller, ""Mission to Paris""

"Author Charles Yu hopes you like his new book, but if not, an apology is built right into the title. ""Sorry Please Thank You"" is his new collection of mind-bending, moving and sometimes melancholy stories arriving in bookstores July 24. Yu's 2010 novel, ""How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe,"" was named one of the best books of the year by TIME magazine. It dealt with a fictional version of the author, another Charles Yu, a lonely time machine repairman stuck in a time loop. In his new book, Yu returns to skewer more science fiction concepts, including the multiverse, time travel, video games and zombies. While he pokes fun at pop culture, Yu also finds the human moments in what he often portrays as an increasingly isolated and sterile existence. Yu's quirky mix of science fiction and social commentary has attracted a loyal following among discerning readers and critics. He has been favorably compared to writers like Kurt Vonnegut, Philip Roth and  Jonathan Lethem. When he's not writing, Yu is a lawyer living in Los Angeles with his wife and their two children. CNN recently interviewed Yu by e-mail. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: Where did the title come from? Yu: The title comes from the last story in the book. It was originally a piece that I actually wrote onto a cocktail napkin, as part of Esquire's Napkin Fiction Project, and which I expanded for the collection. A lot of the stories in the book are about different universes, some big, some small, some of which already exist today, and some of which are not hard to imagine in the near future. These are artificial environments created or enabled through technology, and I was interested in how people communicate, in these environments, about how people talk to each other, about what limitations there are in language as a medium to express our desires, how technology might remove some of those limitations, but create new ones we've never had before. ""Sorry Please Thank You"" seemed appropriate as a title, being words for concepts that, if not universal, are found in a great many languages and cultures. See the story Charles Yu wrote on a cocktail napkin that inspired his latest book . CNN: Was this book any harder or easier to write than your last? Yu: It was harder. This is my third book, and each one has been harder than the last. I'm not sure I like the way this trend is going. ... CNN: Where do you find your ideas and inspiration? Yu: I go looking for them in a bunch of places, and they're never where they are supposed to be. So I take a break, sit down, gaze off into some corner of the room, and there it is: an idea. The problem is, the next time I will start by looking in that same corner, and of course there's nothing there anymore. So I start the process over again. CNN: Do you think multiple universes exist and are there alternate Charles Yus out there? Yu: I've been fascinated by the idea of a multiverse ever since I first learned of it, from my alternate self. OK, no, not from my alternate self. From a book by David Deutsch, who I have raved about elsewhere. And now, I'm fascinated to be reading about all of these other speculative hypotheses about different kinds of multiverses. It's a really mind-scrambling idea, the kind of idea that, once it's in your head, it's hard to remember what it was like before you'd ever been exposed to it. I personally hope there are no alternate universes (except in the sense that Deutsch uses the term), though. This one is strange enough, and if it turns out to be the only one, that would make it even more mysterious. CNN: The future you write about often feels sad and lonely. With that in mind, do you think new technology is making us more isolated? Yu: With, say, social media, in the short term, I think it's a multiplier and an aggregator and an accelerator. It doesn't change who we are, it just enables us to say things faster, and to more people -- but at some point that quantitative effect shades into a qualitative change in how we relate to each other. And some aspects of social media make us more connected. But other aspects reduce the need, and to some extent, desire, to talk to people face-to-face, and it's easy to understand how those aspects might be making some people feel more lonely than ever. But social media is just one part of technology. There are so many other incredible things being developed now. For instance, I watched that video a few weeks ago, of the woman, a quadriplegic woman, who moved a robotic arm with her mind. So that she could take a sip of her drink. The look on her face as she did it (and the look on the face of the researcher who was with her) -- it was unbelievable and moving and I could not stop watching it, over and over again. Here is a person who is, in some ways, more isolated than anyone -- her desire, her will to move is trapped inside of her unmovable body. And technology and human ingenuity has brought her will back into the world, reconnected her with the objects and people around her. CNN: You've been described as a science-fiction writer and compared to writers like Kurt Vonnegut, Philip Roth and Jonathan Lethem. What do you think of these labels and comparisons? Yu: Those are all ludicrous comparisons. And I welcome them wholeheartedly. But seriously, the three writers you just named are on the very top shelf of my personal pantheon, along with a few others. I go back to them over and over again for inspiration and, of course, to steal whatever I can from them. As for the label science-fiction writer -- I'll take it, and wear that label with pride. But there's plenty of room on my shirt for other labels, too. CNN: What does your family think of your writing? Yu: They're very supportive. And my daughter, who is 4, is starting to tell people that her dad is a ""book writer"" which makes me feel the strangest kind of pride, for some reason. I think it's the way she says it -- matter of fact, like, you're dad's a fireman? Oh, that's cool, mine is a book writer.

"Pakistani authorities have ordered six foreigners working for the aid group Save the Children to leave the country, officials said Thursday, suggesting the aid workers had been helping a foreign spy agency operating on Pakistani soil. An official from the Pakistani Foreign Ministry and a Pakistani security official confirmed the order and said it was linked to suspicions the foreigners had been working with the spy agency. They declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the news media. A spokesman for the Save the Children, Ghulam Qadri, denied the accusations against the organization, which operates in dozens of countries. He said officials from the Interior Ministry hadn't explained why the foreign workers had to leave. The Pakistani authorities have previously alleged that Save the Children was linked to the CIA's search in Pakistan for Osama bin Laden, accusations the organization has long denied. Bin Laden was killed in a U.S. Navy SEAL raid in Pakistan in May 2011. ""Save the Children has never been involved in any activity beyond our mandate,"" Qadri said. ""We have always cooperated with investigators and provided them with all the information they have asked for."" In a May 2011 report, Pakistani investigators alleged that Save the Children's country director in Pakistan at the time had introduced doctor Shakil Afridi to the CIA in 2008. Pakistani authorities accused Afridi of working with the CIA to set up a fake vaccination campaign to try verify bin Laden's whereabouts. Save the Children denies being involved with the CIA or the search for bin Laden. Afridi ""has never worked for Save the Children,"" Qadri said. ""This has been made clear."" Afridi is now serving a 33-year prison sentence related to separate charges of providing medical care for Pakistani militant groups. Qadri said the authorities had initially given Save the Children's six foreign employees two weeks to leave the country, but the group is negotiating for more time. He said some of the employees had already left Pakistan. Save the Children says the group remains fully operational with more than 2,000 Pakistanis working in 70 districts throughout the country. ""We have a firm resolve that we will put the needs of the children first,"" Qadri said. ""We'll continue to work with the same spirit and zeal for the rights of the children in this country.""","The Pakistani authorities have previously linked Save the Children to the CIA .

"The U.S. National Security Agency has secretly succeeded in breaking much of the encryption that keeps people's personal data safe online, according to reports by The New York Times, The Guardian and ProPublica. The reports, produced in partnership and published Thursday, are the latest to emerge based on documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden to Britain's Guardian newspaper. According to the reports, the NSA, alongside its UK equivalent, Government Communications Headquarters, better known as GCHQ, has been able to unscramble much of the encoding that protects everything from personal e-mails to banking systems, medical records and Internet chats. The agencies' methods include the use of supercomputers to crack codes, covert measures to introduce weaknesses into encryption standards and behind-doors collaboration with technology companies and Internet service providers themselves. ""Through these covert partnerships, the agencies have inserted secret vulnerabilities -- known as backdoors or trapdoors -- into commercial encryption software,"" The Guardian says. The Guardian cites a 2010 GCHQ memo that it says describes a briefing on NSA accomplishments given to GCHQ employees. ""For the past decade, NSA has lead (sic) an aggressive, multi-pronged effort to break widely used Internet encryption technologies,"" the memo reportedly says. ""Vast amounts of encrypted Internet data which have up till now been discarded are now exploitable."" A second memo is quoted as saying that when the British analysts, who often work alongside NSA officers, were first told about the program, ""those not already briefed were gobsmacked."" Another document states that GCHQ has been working to find ways into the encrypted data sent via four big Internet firms, Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Microsoft's Hotmail, the reports claim. GCHQ told CNN it had no comment on The Guardian report. The reports claim that the NSA worked to develop more covert ways of unscrambling online data after losing a public battle in the 1990s to insert a government ""back door"" into all programming. 'Foundation of web security' Computer security expert Mikko Hypponen believes the revelation is the most important leak to date from Snowden. ""It may not have gained as many headlines as some of his other stories, because most people don't understand how crypto systems work. If indeed U.S intelligence does indeed have such a wide range of systems, then I'm surprised,"" he told CNN. Crypto encryption is relevant to everyday applications that everyone uses, for example in communications and transactions, he said. ""Now we learn that the foundation of web security has been compromised."" Hypponen, the chief research officer for F-Secure, said he believes the NSA and GCHQ had probably cracked the encryption by placing moles in key companies at key locations. ""Any major service provider must have sizable amounts of moles from intelligence agencies. Remember that the NSA has 35,000 people working for it,"" he said. ""The ordinary user should not be worried by these revelations -- it's obvious that intelligence agencies are not interested in hacking financial transactions -- but they should be outraged."" He suggested those outside the United States should be the most concerned. ""How many U.S. politicians use French cloud-services? Almost none. But how many French politicians use U.S. cloud services? All of them,"" he said. ""Remember that 96% of the planet's inhabitants are foreigners to the United States, so it's wrong that the U.S. has a legal right to access foreign communications."" Public concern . The scope of hidden U.S. surveillance programs has been brought to public light through leaks to media outlets by Snowden, who fled the United States and is now in Russia under temporary asylum. He faces espionage charges. The revelations have led many Americans, according to polls, to harbor skepticism about the NSA programs. They've also generated concern in Congress as well as from privacy groups and libertarians. Last month, President Barack Obama sought to allay people's unease over the work of the intelligence agency in an interview with CNN ""New Day"" anchor Chris Cuomo. Obama said he was confident no one at the NSA is ""trying to abuse this program or listen in on people's e-mail."" The president chalked much of the concern with domestic snooping on changes in technology. ""I think there are legitimate concerns that people have that technology is moving so quick,"" Obama said. ""What I recognize is that we're going to have to continue to improve the safeguards and as technology moves forward, that means that we may be able to build technologies that give people more assurance.""","This is the most important leak to date from Edward Snowden, an analyst says .

"(CNN) -- A strong storm system Wednesday brought rain and winds that shut down the Statue of Liberty and delayed flights for more than four hours at airports in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Flight times were almost back to normal by late Wednesday. The wind snapped a large lighted Christmas tree at the South Street Seaport a few blocks from the Brooklyn Bridge, CNN New York affiliate WABC reported. No injuries were reported. The Statue of Liberty was forced to close at 2 p.m. because of inclement weather, the National Park Service said on Twitter. Weather permitting, the venue was expected to reopen Thursday . Heavy rain triggered flooding in some Eastern states a day after the system raked the Southeast. ""The flooding is getting way worse"" near Austin, Pennsylvania, said CNN iReporter Marcia, who asked that only her first name be used. ""They are closing down roads. Some people have been evacuated. ... This is worse than the '72 flood, from what I am hearing."" The storm system brought flooding and snow to areas around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, slowing commuters and prompting some schools to open late, according to CNN affiliate WPXI. CNN has confirmed that there is a state of emergency in Butler County, Pennsylvania, until at least Thursday morning because of the flooding due to storms from late Tuesday and Wednesday. During much of the day, ground stops were in effect for New York's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports because of low clouds and heavy rain, according to CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris. Flight delays of more than four hours had been reported at the Newark, New Jersey, airport, and delays of more than an hour were reported at airports in Teterboro, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One person was killed and a second injured Wednesday when high winds caused a tree to fall on a car with two people in it in West Milford, New Jersey, according to the National Weather Service in Upton, New York. Tracy Gill, another CNN iReporter, awoke to rising waters in Coudersport, Pennsylvania. Gill estimated the water to be about a foot deep and still rising. ""I was unable to leave to pick up my daughter from preschool. The road is pretty much gone,"" Gill said. On Wednesday, the storm system set its sights on much of the Eastern Seaboard. Severe thunderstorms were possible from the Florida Panhandle north to Maryland, and flash flooding was possible from northern Georgia into Vermont and New Hampshire, according to the National Weather Service. Also Wednesday, the National Weather Service confirmed that it was a tornado -- packing winds of 130 mph -- that tore through suburban Atlanta, Georgia, on Tuesday, damaging more than 50 homes and a business. The structures were damaged in Buford, Georgia, in Gwinnett County, by an EF-2 tornado, said Steve Nelson, science and operations officer for the National Weather Service's forecast office in Peachtree City, Georgia. ""It was terrifying at the time,"" Edwin Pellicia, resident of a hard-hit Buford subdivision, told CNN affiliate WXIA. ""Now you're just thankful to be alive. ... Today, you really appreciate the time that you have with family and having your life."" At least 56 homes and one business in the area were damaged by the tornado. Twelve of those homes suffered major damage. There were no reported injuries. One person, a 54-year-old man, died in a traffic accident in Gwinnett County on Tuesday while the storms were moving through, according to the county's police department. Strong winds associated with the storm apparently caused a tree to break in half and fall on the his vehicle, officials said in a statement. In Atlanta on Tuesday, the system downed trees and power lines and snarled the afternoon commute, with roads in several areas closed because of flooding. Video showed damaged roofs and trees in northern Gwinnett County, about 35 miles northeast of downtown Atlanta. A tornado warning had not been issued for the neighborhood where the damage occurred. Footage showed one home missing an exterior corner, with siding and insulation strewn about the area. ""I was on my way home from work, and the parents were calling us to see if the kids were OK. I knew a tornado hit at Gravel Springs [Road]; I didn't know it was going to be our house,"" resident Erin Birdsong told affiliate WSB. ""I personally ran into the bathroom,"" resident Ortiz Edwards told affiliate WGCL. ""The whole subdivision is devastated."" Rescue crews conducted door-to-door searches to make sure everyone in the area was accounted for. Several families had to find a place to stay overnight, according to WGCL. ""We've got pillows and tennis shoes, change of clothes. ... Hopefully (we'll) get back here tomorrow and start the cleanup process,"" resident Ashley Tremblay said. Pellicia said the upcoming holiday season will be more meaningful to him because of the experience. ""It's going to look different, but it's going to mean a whole lot more,"" he told WXIA. In addition, several residents expressed gratitude that no one lost their life, adding that homes can be repaired. Tornadoes during this time of year can be particularly dangerous because they are fast-moving and obscured by rain and darkness, according to Morris. In Mississippi, state authorities dispatched emergency crews Tuesday to survey the damage after an onslaught of severe weather that injured at least 32 people, damaged property in 10 counties and cut power. Four tornadoes classified as EF-2 hit the state, the National Weather Service forecast office in Jackson said Tuesday evening. Two were in Yazoo County, one slammed Starkville, and the fourth touched down in Raleigh. An EF-2 twister (on the Enhanced Fujita Tornado Damage Scale) produces wind gusts, estimated by damage assessments, of 110 to 137 mph, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In Attala County, storms destroyed nine mobile homes, injured six people and left parts of the area without power, the service said. A tornado touched down in Yazoo County on Monday night, causing damage to a courthouse in downtown Yazoo City and tossing debris in a wide area, according to an emergency management spokesman. The twister touched down about 8:05 p.m., according to the National Weather Service's Jackson office. CNN's Sean Morris contributed to this report.","NEW: Flooding reported in Pittsburgh, elsewhere in Pennsylvania .

"Craig Johnson looks like he could have stepped out of the pages of one of his own best-selling Western novels. He's a tall man in cowboy boots, a pearl snap shirt and a 10-gallon hat, carrying a leather satchel. With the late-day sun behind him, he could even pass for his fictional hero, Sheriff Walt Longmire. There are some similarities between the writer and his subject, and readers have been known to confuse the two. Both men are ranchers in Wyoming, although Walt is from the fictional Absaroka County while Johnson lives in the very real town of Ucross, population 25. Both have a history in law enforcement: Johnson worked briefly in the field long ago, while Walt is a legendary lawman among crime fiction readers. In reality, Johnson dreamed up Walt Longmire years ago in his first novel, 2004's ""The Cold Dish."" Eight years and eight best-selling books later, both men are still going strong. Johnson's newest, ""As the Crow Flies,"" debuted on the New York Times bestseller list last week. This time out, Walt and his close friend Henry Standing Bear are drawn into a murder investigation after they see a young Crow woman fall to her death on the Northern Cheyenne reservation. Johnson's Western crime novels have long been a favorite of critics and fans. Now, they're about to reach a whole new audience on cable television. A&E has adapted Johnson's creation into the new series ""Longmire,"" premiering Sunday. Currently on a national promotional tour, the author sat down with CNN to talk about his new book, the TV series and life in Wyoming. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: ""Longmire"" is about to premiere on TV. How involved have you been with the show? Johnson: It's been a real surprise. Generally, what happens is, Hollywood writes you a check and says, ""See you later."" My situation has been a little bit different. I was asked to be an executive creative consultant on the show. I bounced back and forth with the writers on ideas for the show. Then they sent me the first screenplay for the pilot episode. I went through it, and I made something like 57 changes and sent it back to them, and out of the 57 changes, they made 55 of them. So it's been very hands-on and very responsive. They've kept me in the loop the whole time. I was on set for three weeks while they were filming the pilot. I was very lucky and have been working with really good people. It's been an amazing process. CNN: It seems the TV series is bringing you wider exposure and new fans. Johnson: It seems like it with the book sales. The crowds at book signings are larger. For me, it's all about the exposure for the books. I live in Ucross, Wyoming. I have a little ranch there. That's where I was when Hollywood found me, and that's where I'll be when Hollywood leaves me. To be honest, I don't have any great want or need to move to L.A. or anything like that. I like my life, and I really love writing the books. If someone had asked me if I would have had as much fun writing the eighth or ninth book in the series as I did the first one, I wouldn't have thought that was possible, but it is. I'm having more fun now, because I feel like I've written enough to think I kind of know what I'm doing. At least, I hope so. CNN: Walt has changed a great deal over the course of eight books. Have you changed your approach to writing them? Johnson: One of the things that's very important to me in the books is the characters have to change. They have to have things happen to them. You can't keep them in a stasis and try and write formulaic books. I think some of the best stories I've ever heard in my life have been when I've been sitting on a porch sitting in a rocking chair snapping green beans or out on a hunting camp looking over a fire at a guy who starts out, ""let me tell you what happened to me last month."" I really love that old-fashioned style of storytelling. There may have been a time with crime fiction when just writing a whodunnit was enough. A lot of readers come to crime fiction with the same expectations they have for literary fiction. They want fully developed characters, they want an arc of storyline, they want social commentary, they want humor, they want history, and they want to know who did it by the time they get to the end. So that kind of raises the bar up to a level where it makes the books much more worth writing, to be honest with you. If I was just trying to find clever ways of killing people that would get really boring really quick. I'm lucky to be doing what I'm doing. CNN: I think one of the things your readers really appreciate is your realistic portrayal of life on the ""rez."" Johnson: My ranch is up on the Wyoming/Montana border at the base of the Bighorn Mountains. Due north is the Northern Cheyenne reservation, slightly to the west is the Crow reservation, down to the southwest we have the Arapaho and the Shoshone, and then due east and a little to the south we've got the Lakota. So we're surrounded by these sovereign nations. For me, that's part of where I live, and to leave that out would be, excuse the term, criminal. I think whenever you're writing about a place or a people, if it's something you care deeply about, then the one thing you owe them is honesty. That means you can't just sugarcoat it. You have to be as honest as you can about the people, about the place, about everything. Whether it's the rampant alcoholism or unemployment or educational problems. CNN: Many of your readers believe Walt is real. Some think you and Walt are really the same person. How much do you share in common with your lead character? Johnson: The best quote about that is from my wife. She says, ""Walt is who Craig would like to be in 10 years ,but he's off to an incredibly slow start."" Walt's a much better person than I'll ever be, but he has his faults, too. I tend to refer to Walt as over. He's overweight, he's overage, he's overly depressed, but he still goes out and gets the job done. If there's one thing I underestimated when I was putting him together, it's the empathy, the sympathy that people have heaped upon this guy and how much they would care. He's not perfect. He's damaged goods. It's very flattering that people are that concerned about the characters. And it's true, women give me love notes to give to Walt. I get a lot of veterans and a lot of law enforcement people that give me challenge coins and say, ""if you could pass that on to Walt, I would really appreciate it."" People think this guy's real. My gosh, I think that's the highest praise a writer could ever possibly get. Read an excerpt from Johnson's new novel on his website.","Craig Johnson writes the ""Longmire"" novels .

"U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking computer networks around the world for years, apparently targeting fat data pipes that push immense amounts of data around the Internet, NSA leaker Edward Snowden told the South China Morning Post on Wednesday. Among some 61,000 reported targets of the National Security Agency, Snowden said, are hundreds of computers in China -- which U.S. officials have increasingly criticized as the source of thousands of attacks on U.S. military and commercial networks. China has denied such attacks. The Morning Post said it had seen documents provided by Snowden but was unable to verify their authenticity. The English-language news agency, which operates in Hong Kong, also said it was unable to independently verify allegations of U.S. hacking of networks in Hong Kong and mainland China since 2009. Snowden told the paper that some of the targets included the Chinese University of Hong Kong, public officials and students. The documents also ""point to hacking activity by the NSA against mainland targets,"" the newspaper reported. The claims came just days after U.S. President Barack Obama pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to address cyberattacks emanating from China that Obama described as ""direct theft of United States property."" Snowden's allegations appear to give weight to claims by some Chinese government officials that the country has been a victim of similar hacking efforts coming from the United States. His claims came as Gen. Keith Alexander, the National Security Agency chief, testified at a U.S. Senate hearing that the country's cyberinfrastructure, including telephones and computer networks, is somewhat vulnerable to attack. On a scale of one to 10, ""our critical infrastructure's preparedness to withstand a destructive cyberattack is about a three, based on my experience,"" he said. In the Morning Post interview -- published one week after the British newspaper The Guardian revealed the first leaks attributed to Snowden -- he claimed the agency he once worked for as a contractor typically targets high-bandwidth data lines that connect Internet nodes located around the world. ""We hack network backbones -- like huge Internet routers, basically -- that give us access to the communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to hack every single one,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying. A ""backbone"" is part of the inner workings of a computer network that links different parts of that network. It is used to deliver data from one part of the network to another and, as such, could expose data from multiple computers if hacked. 'Trying to bully' Snowden, 29, worked for the Booz Allen Hamilton computer consulting firm until Monday, when he was fired after documents he provided to journalists revealed the existence of secret programs to collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and the Internet activity of overseas residents. While he has not been charged, the FBI is conducting an investigation into the leaks, and he has told The Guardian that he expects the United States will try to prosecute him. Snowden told the Morning Post that he felt U.S. officials were pressuring his family and also accused them of ""trying to bully"" Hong Kong into extraditing him to prevent the release of more damaging information. He vowed to resist extradition efforts if it comes to that, saying he ""would rather stay and fight the United States government in the courts, because I have faith in Hong Kong's rule of law."" ""My intention is to ask the courts and people of Hong Kong to decide my fate,"" the South China Morning Post quoted Snowden as saying. ""I have been given no reason to doubt your system.'' But Hong Kong lawmaker Regina Ip, a former secretary of security for the territory, said Tuesday that while any extradition process could take months, Snowden isn't necessarily beyond the reach of the United States. ""If he thought there was a legal vacuum in Hong Kong which renders him safe from U.S. jurisdiction, that is unlikely to be the case,"" she said. The newspaper said Snowden has been hiding in undisclosed locations inside the semi-autonomous Chinese territory since checking out of his hotel room Monday -- a day after he revealed his identity in an interview with The Guardian. Snowden told the Morning Post he is not trying to evade U.S. authorities. ""People who think I made a mistake in picking Hong Kong as a location misunderstand my intentions,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying. ""I am not here to hide from justice; I am here to reveal criminality."" The NSA and the National Intelligence director did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Asked during a media briefing on Wednesday for comment on Snowden's latest claims,  U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki declined. She said she had not seen the latest Morning Post report. On the defensive . The revelations have renewed debate over surveillance in the United States and overseas in the name of fighting terrorism, with supporters saying the programs revealed by Snowden are legal and have helped stop terror plots. Civil liberties advocates, however, call the measures dangerous and unacceptable intrusions. Such criticisms have put Obama and his allies on the issue -- both Democrats and Republicans -- on the defensive against mounting criticisms from a similarly bipartisan group of critics demanding changes to rein in the programs. There also is a sharp division among Americans over the issue. A Gallup poll released Wednesday found that 44% of Americans believe Snowden did the right thing by releasing details about the classified surveillance programs, while 42% said it was wrong and 14% said they were unsure. The poll for that question had a 6% margin of error. It also found that more Americans disapprove than approve of the government's surveillance programs, 53% to 37%. Ten percent had no opinion. The poll for that question had a 4% margin of error. Those differences were on display Wednesday when Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency, testified at a hearing into cybersecurity technology and civil liberties. Officials have been unable to explain controversial data mining programs because they have been classified, Alexander testified. But Alexander rejected the Snowden's claim that the NSA could tap into any American's phone or computer. ""I know of no way to do that,"" Alexander said. But he testified that phone records obtained by the government helped prevent ""dozens"" of terrorist events. He would not discuss disrupted plots broadly, saying they were classified. But he did say federal data mining appeared to play a role in helping to disrupt a plot in recent years to attack the New York subway system. Alexander said information developed overseas was passed along to the FBI, which he said was able to identify eventual suspect Najibullah Zazi in Colorado and ultimately uncover a plot. Zazi pleaded guilty to terror-related charges in 2010. While not on the roster for Wednesday's hearing, another administration official in the spotlight is Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, whom Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden has singled out for how he answered questions about the telephone surveillance program in March. In March, Wyden asked Clapper whether the NSA collects ""any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?"" ""No sir,"" Clapper said. On Saturday, Clapper told NBC News that he answered in the ""most truthful or least most untruthful manner"" possible. Clapper told NBC that he had interpreted ""collection"" to mean actually examining the materials gathered by the NSA. He previously told the National Journal he had meant that ""the NSA does not voyeuristically pore through U.S. citizens' e-mails,"" but he did not mention e-mails at the hearing. NSA leaker's girlfriend says she's 'lost at sea' EU questions . Fallout over revelations about the NSA's intelligence-gathering has reached the European Union's governing body, where Vice President Viviane Reding raised concerns that the United States may have targeted some of its citizens. Reding said she plans to raise the issue during a meeting Friday with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. ""The respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law are the foundations of the EU-U.S. relationship. This common understanding has been, and must remain, the basis of cooperation between us in the area of Justice,"" Reding, the EU commissioner for justice, said Wednesday. ""Trust that the rule of law will be respected is also essential to the stability and growth of the digital economy, including transatlantic business. This is of paramount importance for individuals and companies alike.""","An EU commissioner wants to know whether the U.S. targeted European citizens .

"From the courts of the ancient Pharaohs to a simple game of catch on a spring afternoon; the ball has a centuries-long history of play. It's one of our simplest yet most enduring inventions. While the games have evolved, the ball in all its various forms continues to play a key role in different cultures around the world. With many of our favorite games now in full swing -- baseball, basketball, soccer, tennis and golf make for a busy sporting season -- have you ever stopped to think what makes us play? That's the question that drives the fascinating new book ""The Ball: Discovering the Object of the Game,"" from anthropologist and sports enthusiast John Fox. Fox was inspired by that simple but curious question from his 8-year old son. Seeking the answer, he set off on a global adventure that included excavating ancient ball courts in Central America and getting a front-row seat to a medieval version of football played by a mob of hundreds in the Scottish Isles. But ""The Ball"" is more than a history lesson. Fox goes beyond the origin of sport and offers some surprising insight into why we love the games we play. CNN recently spoke to Fox from his home in Boston about the book. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: Your book starts with a basic question from your son, ""Why do we play ball?"" Did you find an answer? Fox: I wouldn't say I found an answer. It's a philosophical question as much as a scientific one, but what I did find was a variety of answers that add up to something interesting. One of the things that surprised me was just learning about why we play in the first place and what the benefits are psychologically and cognitively. We think of playing sports as having obvious physical rewards, but I learned that play is a way that we develop knowledge and cognitive skills about the world. The importance of playing ball for our ability in becoming intelligent, sentient beings is as important as any physical benefits. That surprised me because I don't think we think of play as something that makes us smarter. It makes us able to think better and faster and that was a revelation. CNN: You visited the Scottish isle of Orkney to see an ancient version of football still played there. What was that like? Fox: Orkney is an extraordinary place on the edge of the world so steeped in tradition. It's not surprising that it's a place where you would find this vestige of old football that's hung on for hundreds of years. This game is played only twice a year, which automatically elevates it to a level of importance. It's more than a game; it's a communal rite. So when you go there you're immediately swept up in all of that. It's pretty rough and tumble when you get 200 men battling for six hours on cobblestone streets over a ball. What I was profoundly struck by was how much that game gave the players and the families a sense of place, a sense of belonging and a sense of tradition. Coming back year after year to play this game and watch this game really defines who they are. I feel like there's elements of that in why we play and why we love sports, but I feel like we've kind of lost touch with that to some extent and these people in Orkney really understand it and they live it. CNN: With the success of the Beijing games, and Qatar due to host the World Cup, it seems like sports is becoming more global than ever. Would you agree? Fox: Look at soccer, it came out of these small villages in England and France, a very particular cultural context in medieval times and yet the entire world has embraced this game. It shows that these sports have the ability to transcend culture, to transcend language and other barriers, race and so on. I think the Olympics and the World Cup are the best examples of that. I believe the last World Cup final was watched by literally half the world. I think it was over 3 billion people watched that game. Can you think of any other single thing that half the world is doing at any moment? I can tell you there's just nothing else. It is heartening. Despite all the controversies, the idea of the world coming out to play together, following a common set of rules, that's pretty profound. CNN: How do Americans compare to sports fans in other countries? Fox: I think about the same. There are definitely parts of the world that are more passionate than others. What's unique about the U.S. is in many respects the games we play. We like our own games and that does distinguish us. We have this history of go-it-alone American exceptionalism whereby we chose to play baseball. We chose to play our own variation on football and only recently warmed up to playing what came to be known as soccer. To me that's what makes us unique. It's less the passion and more what we're passionate about. CNN: Do controversies like the NFL bounties say something about sports culture in the U.S.? Fox: I don't think scandal is unique to American sports in any way. There have been plenty of scandals around bribes related to World Cup sites and plenty of stuff coming out of the Olympics. I think with scandals emerging a lot of it has to do with the massive infusion of money into international sports. These are multi-national enterprises. The stakes are very high for everyone involved. It's not surprising that over time you see more and more scandal. Looking at America, we put so much importance on the sports we watch. They're more than games. Again, there's a sense of belonging and identity. So we take umbrage when steroids violate our sense of fair play or when we find out that football players are being paid extra on the side to injure the quarterback of another team like we've seen with the NFL bounty scandal. Violence has been part of football all along. It's one of the reasons we're riveted by the game, but the bounties push it over the edge. The object became to injure another player and I think that's unfortunate because then it's no longer play in my opinion. CNN: How do you see sport evolving in the future? Fox: One of the things I found really heartening in a way is that sports have evolved a fair bit, but not as much as you would imagine. As focused as I was on the ball, I spent time at a football factory in Ohio and the technology they were using to hand craft these Super Bowl footballs was really not that far off from what was being done in a cobbler's shop in England in the 1850s. I think in the future, we'll see more interaction between digital technology and live sports. There's a lot of interesting work going on with smart footballs, equipment with GPS and other instruments embedded within them so you can integrate the viewer's experience on screen with what's happening on the field in a more seamless way. So a quarterback can get readouts on exactly how he's handling and throwing a ball or how it's being caught. I think you'll see bit by bit that kind of technology creeping more and more into the game. I look ahead and I don't see dramatic revolutions, I see incremental change.

"Shin Dong-hyuk is the only known person born in a North Korean prison camp that escaped and survived to tell the tale. Journalist Blaine Harden first uncovered Shin's story in 2008 and has now turned it into the riveting new biography ""Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West."" North Korea has been splashed across world headlines in recent weeks over its threat to launch a long-range rocket, its suspected nuclear program and for its continued defiance of the West. If you want a singular perspective on what goes on inside the rogue regime, then you must read his story. It's a harrowing tale of endurance and courage, at times grim but ultimately life-affirming. In the book, Harden offers an unnerving glimpse into one of the world's most repressive regimes. Until now, little was known about North Korea's labor camps, even though they've existed for decades. They're believed to hold between 150,000 and 200,000 prisoners and while they're plainly visible in satellite photos, the North Korean government claims they don't exist. Shin knows otherwise. He was born in one of these ""hidden gulags."" He grew up in squalid conditions with unending, back-breaking work, and knew nothing of the outside world. He was starved, beaten and tortured. One of his earliest memories: Being forced to watch the execution of his mother and brother. It wasn't until Shin was 23 years old he was able to climb through a high-voltage fence and escape. Somehow, Shin found his way to China, South Korea, and eventually the United States. Today, Shin lives in Seoul, but is still dealing with the psychological trauma of his former life in the camp. Harden, a reporter for PBS Frontline and a contributor to The Economist, brings Shin's amazing story to life. CNN recently spoke to him about the book and his relationship with Shin. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: This is an amazing story, how did you learn about Shin and when did you first meet him? Harden: I heard about Shin from a human rights activist in Tokyo, where I was living and working as a correspondent for The Washington Post. At the time, I was desperately searching for a way to write about life inside North Korea. I quickly flew to Seoul and met Shin there for lunch in December, 2008. That meeting is detailed in the book. CNN: What did you think of Shin and how difficult was it to confirm the details of his story? Watch an interview with Shin Dong-hyuk . Harden: Talking to Shin in person, his story sounds believable. It's because of the intensity and precision of his memory. His body, too, is a map of what he endured, with burns on his back and legs, and his partially-severed finger. His arms are bowed from childhood labor. Confirming the details of his story is impossible, if you mean going to Camp 14 and asking questions of his captors and torturers. North Korea denies the existence of Camp 14 and all the other labor camps. Outsiders, including the (International Committee of the Red Cross), have never been allowed to visit them. The only way for North Korea to ""refute, contradict or invalidate"" the testimony of Shin and other camp survivors would be to permit outsiders to visit the camps. Otherwise, their testimony stands. CNN: What did you find most shocking or disturbing about Shin's ordeal? Harden: His anger at his mother -- and his statement that he was glad to see her die: These were the things that shocked me most upon meeting Shin. But as we continued to talk -- over the course of day-long conversations that extended for weeks in Seoul and later in Southern California -- I came to understand that guards had raised him to be suspicious of everyone. He saw anyone who stood between him and his next meal as a potential enemy. He was raised to see personal redemption in acts that ratted out his own family. He believed that his mother, by discussing an escape plan with Shin's brother, had been irresponsible and reckless. Since he was a toddler, he had been forced to memorize camp rules that prescribe death for anyone who tries to escape or knows about an escape plan but does not report it immediately. The moment Shin heard that his mother was considering an escape, his camp-bred instincts kicked in. He had to betray her: He knew that if he did not, it would mean his torture or death. He did turn her in. But he was tortured anyway. Watch the book trailer for ""Escape from Camp 14"" CNN: How is Shin doing now? Harden: He is now living in Seoul, after spending the better part of two years in Torrance, California; Seattle; Columbus, Ohio, and Washington D.C. He has begun working with a partner on a webcast aimed at telling the Korean-speaking world more about North Korea and the camps. His life's goal is to raise awareness of the camps. He wants them closed as soon as possible. Everything else in his life is secondary to that goal. That is why he was willing to go though the misery of long interviews with me. In the book, in trying to explain how painful those interviews often were, I used the image of a dentist drilling without anesthetics -- for more than two years. Shin did not like it, but he put up with it because he wants everyone to know what went on in Camp 14 -- what still goes on. CNN: Shin must have left a lasting impression on you, what kind of impact did his story have on you personally? Harden: His story has obviously touched me profoundly. And like him, I want everyone in the world to know about the camps and to understand -- through an emotionally wrenching immersion in Shin's life inside Camp 14 -- that North Korea's dictatorship is sustained by child slavery, starvation, and unimaginable cruelty.

"Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb may have some leadership vacancies. The reported deaths of two of its most effective, wealthy and ruthless commanders within just a few days would be a major blow to the group that has invested heavily in establishing a stronghold in Mali, beyond the reach of that country's weak government and army. On Saturday, Chad said its troops deployed in the remote Adrar des Ifoghas mountains in north-eastern Mali had destroyed a jihadist base and killed a number of terrorists, including their leader Moctar Belmoktar. Two days earlier another prominent jihadist -- Abdelhamid Abou Zeid -- was reported killed in the same area. The Chadian President Idriss Deby and a U.S. official subsequently confirmed his death, but the French have not.  So far only the Chadians have reported the death of Belmoktar. But French officials confirm heavy fighting continues in the area where he was reported killed, and have disclosed that a French soldier has been killed in the operation. If both Abou Zeid and Belmoktar have been killed ""it would be big news,"" according to Andrew Lebovich, a Senegal-based analyst who recently spent time in Mali, and has long followed the evolution of AQIM. ""It would mean the removal of two very experienced senior commanders,"" he told CNN. The Ifoghas are an impenetrable range of peaks, ravines and caves with virtually no human presence beyond the nomadic Kel people -- a Tuareg tribe that raises goats, camels and sheep. Belmoktar and Zeid, while frequently bitter rivals, had both established camps in the Ifoghas as a precaution against international efforts to rid northern Mali of Islamic militants. Last week, French military spokesman  Col. Thierry Burkhard said the militants were  ""sustained in a region they know very well. They have set up defensive underground positions,  that their members can move between, and they have prepositioned weapons and food depots,"" he said. A year in control . A year ago, as the Malian army and government collapsed in the face of a revolt in the north led by Tuareg separatists, the al Qaeda affiliate and other militant groups had moved into the major towns of the north - effectively splitting Mali in two. Abou Zeid had established himself in  the fabled city of Timbuktu, introducing Sharia law, banning music and forcing women to wear the full veil in public. Belmoktar was seen in and around the town of Gao further east. Both men are -- or were -- Algerians, but had seized new opportunities in northern Mali, enriching themselves with smuggling and kidnapping operations, and taking advantage of their intimate knowledge of the desolate geography of the region. Abou Zeid's group is thought to be still holding four French hostages kidnapped from a uranium mine in neighboring Niger in 2010. Belmoktar had reportedly made millions of dollars from smuggling between Mali, Algeria and Libya -- as well as ransoming westerners his group had captured. He was also behind the attack on the In Amenas gas plant in southern Algeria in January, in which more than thirty foreign workers were killed. The French military intervention in Mali began days before that attack, and was subsequently supported by troops from several west African states. As French forces pushed north and jihadist bases were bombed from the air, hundreds of militants retreated into the desert and mountains. And in the weeks since, much of the military action -- including airstrikes by the French and joint Franco-Chadian deployments on the ground -- has been in and around the Ifoghas. Some 1,200 French and 800 Chadian soldiers have been sent to the area, gradually tightening the noose on jihadist fighters who had not disarmed and melted into the general population. Chadian special forces, under the command of the President's son, have proved themselves  effective in the difficult terrain -- no doubt helped by plenty of practice against rebels in remote parts of their own country. (Chadian militia also dealt Libyan forces a resounding defeat in the 1986 after Moammar Gadhafi tried to seize a border area.) One French official told CNN last month that the Chadians were regarded as the most useful of the west African contingents, which number some 3,000 troops. But Chad's forces have also taken heavy losses in the Ifoghas campaign. On Friday, the bodies of 26 Chadian soldiers were returned to the capital in a ceremony attended by President Deby. Leadership vacuum . Neither Belmoktar nor Abou Zeid sat at the top of AQIM's hierarchy in North Africa but they became the two most powerful al Qaeda figures in the sub-Sahara. Both commanded potent  ""Katiba"" or brigades of fighters intensely loyal to them. Abu Zeid was promoted to a deputy leadership position in the Sahara several years ago by AQIM's Emir Abdelmalek Droukdel out of concern that Belmoktar was growing too strong. The Sahel countries of Mali, Mauretania and Niger became the new center of gravity for  AQIM as Algerian security forces degraded the group in its traditional heartland. Droukdel - isolated and marginalized - struggled to exert control over his southern commanders. In an effort to restore his influence, Droukdel  appointed  a loyalist -- Jemal Oukacha (also known as Yahya Abou el-Hammam)  -- as the overall commander of AQIM in the Sahara last autumn.  He also sent an envoy to northern Mali to announce that Belmoktar had been relieved of his command. But although El Hammam was a ten year veteran of jihad, he is from the north of Algeria and according to analysts has wielded nothing like the influence of Belmoktar or Abou Zeid, who counted criminal kingpins, corrupt politicians and military officers among their contacts. El Hammam was designated as a terrorist leader by the U.S. State Department two weeks ago. It said that previous to his appointment as the Saharan emir ""Hammam led another AQIM element whose members operated in Northern Mali. In that capacity, he participated in several attacks launched on behalf of AQIM in Mauritania."" ""As of late 2011, El Hammam reportedly had possession of multiple European hostages,"" the designation added. Belmokar responded to his effective ""firing"" by Droukdel by setting up a new commando unit called ""We Sign with Blood.""  One of his close associates said he was setting up his own franchise of al Qaeda which would report directly to al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri. He vowed attacks against Western interests if the international community moved against jihadists in northern Mali. Before the bloody conclusion of the siege at In Amenas, he recorded a tape demanding the release of two prominent Jihadists from U.S. prisons.   It appeared to be a calculated bid to raise his profile and popularity amongst jihadists worldwide -- and a shot across the bows of Droukdel. The operation was not without cost for Belmoktar. Several of his most experienced deputies were killed in the attack. Analysts tell CNN he either felt strong enough to risk losing them or the stakes were such that the operation was a necessity. Teh hostage attack was launched across from Libya. Both Belmoktar and Abou Zeid made trips to Libya after the fall of Gadhafi and established a network of contacts there. If they have been killed, analysts say it will set back Al Qaeda's ambitions in Libya. Lebovich told CNN that if both senior commanders have been killed it will likely set back efforts by jihadists to wage a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the French and their allies. But recognizing the scale of the mission to restore Mali's territorial integrity, French officials have indicated that some troops would stay in the country at least until July. France had been hoping to withdraw the majority this month. And it's clear that Islamists groups are far from raising the white flag in parts of northern Mali. Another faction - the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa or MUJAO - remains active around Gao, where there have been several suicide bombings. The local government headquarters was seized by militants for several hours on February 21st, provoking a long gun battle with French and Malian troops. The fighting virtually destroyed the town's market. MUJAO appears to have had close ties to Belmoktar. And Tuareg Islamist leader Iyad ag Ghali -- leader of the group Ansar Dine -- also remains at large. If Belmokar and Abo Zeid are gone, there may be one compensation for AQIM.  Droukdel  and his deputy al-Hammam may be able to wrestle back control of al Qaeda operations in the Sahara. In a letter Droukdel wrote last year and which was found by the Associated Press in Timbuktu last month, AQIM's leader criticized his subordinates in northern Mali for trying to introduce Islamic law too quickly in the  region and for imposing harsh punishments which he said jeopardized their whole project. ""Your officials need to control themselves,"" he wrote. ""It is very probable, perhaps certain, that a military intervention will occur ... which in the end will either force us to retreat to our rear bases or will provoke the people against us,"" he wrote. His prediction was accurate. Now he has to deal with the consequences of AQIM's over-reach in Mali.","If both Abou Zeid and Belmoktar have been killed ""it would be big news,"" analyst says .
They became the two most powerful al Qaeda figures in the sub-Sahara .
If confirmed, their deaths would likely set back efforts by jihadists to wage a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the French ."
"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Three former Atlanta police officers were sentenced Tuesday to prison terms ranging from five to 10 years for covering up a botched drug raid in which a 92-year-old woman was killed. Kathryn Johnston was shot five times in a botched drug raid on her Atlanta home two years ago. Jason Smith was sentenced to 10 years in the November 2006 raid that left Kathryn Johnston dead in a hail of bullets. Former officers Greg Junnier and Arthur Tesler were sentenced to six and five years, respectively, said Patrick Crosby, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of Georgia. Investigators determined the raid at Johnston's home was based on falsified paperwork stating that illegal drugs were present. The incident prompted a major overhaul of the Atlanta Police Department's drug unit. ""Officers who think, as these defendants once did, that the ends justify the means or that 'taking shortcuts' and telling lies will not be discovered and punished should realize that they are risking their careers and their liberty."" U.S. Attorney David Nahmias said in a written statement. ""Officers who try to obstruct justice when their misconduct faces exposure, rather than cooperating in the investigation, should realize that they will face even more severe punishment."" All three men pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death. Smith and Junnier also pleaded guilty to state charges of voluntary manslaughter and making false statements, and Smith admitted to planting bags of marijuana in Johnston's home after her death. U.S. District Judge Julie Carnes ordered all three men to serve three years of supervised release after their prison terms, and to split Johnston's funeral costs, which totaled $8,180, authorities said. On Monday, Junnier broke down on the witness stand during a sentencing hearing, WXIA reported, saying, ""I used to think I was a good person."" Smith said, ""I pray daily for Ms. Johnston. I also pray other officers in Atlanta will have the moral fortitude I didn't have,"" according to WXIA. Tesler was convicted on one state count of making false statements after filling out an affidavit saying that an informant had purchased crack cocaine at Johnston's home in a crime-plagued neighborhood near downtown Atlanta. The informant, however, denied ever having been to Johnston's home, leading to probes by local and federal authorities as well as the breakup and reorganization of the Atlanta police narcotics unit. The raid occurred as police were executing a so-called ""no-knock"" search warrant based on the faulty information. Police said Johnston fired at them with an old pistol during the raid, and they returned fire in self-defense. Johnston's one shot went through her front door and over the officers' heads; they responded with 39 shots, hitting the elderly woman five times. Tesler's state conviction was reversed on appeal, but he pleaded guilty to the federal charge. Junnier and Smith face sentencing March 5 on state charges including voluntary manslaughter, but according to their plea agreement, their sentence will be served at the same time as the federal sentence, authorities said. Shortly after the federal probe began, however, Junnier began cooperating with authorities, providing ""valuable assistance in the investigation and prosecution of Smith and Tesler,"" according to the statement issued by Nahmias' office. Smith also cooperated ""to a more limited extent,"" the statement said, adding that both Junnier and Smith's sentences were reduced because of their cooperation. Prosecutors have said that the officers regularly presented false information to obtain warrants and that they cut corners to make more time for lucrative side jobs providing additional security to businesses, often while on duty, and receiving cash payments. ""As Atlanta police narcotics officers, these three defendants repeatedly failed to follow proper procedures and then lied under oath to obtain search warrants,"" Nahmias said. ""Their routine violations of the Fourth Amendment led to the death of an innocent citizen."" The investigation into the raid at Johnston's home also led to guilty pleas from the police sergeant in charge of the narcotics unit and another officer who admitted to extortion, prosecutors said.","NEW: Two of three men get reduced sentences for cooperating with authorities .

"Airports are no place to sleep, as any weary traveler who has tried to grab a few minutes shuteye during a layover can attest. But that may be changing, thanks to a new breed of short-stay, pay-by-the-hour micro-hotels popping up in airport terminals around the world. Based loosely on the concept of the Japanese ""capsule hotel,"" these cabins and boxes allow sleepy travelers to seal themselves off from the surrounding commotion for a 30-minute power nap or a solid night's sleep without having to leave the terminal for a hotel. Some even contain toilets and showers. In recent years, versions of the concept have emerged from London to Moscow and from Philadelphia to Dubai, with other destinations likely to follow this year. And they are spreading beyond the airport terminal. Yotel, which operates short-stay ""cabins"" in airports in London and Amsterdam, has also opened a hotel in Manhattan based on a similar concept, while Sleepbox, which has a demonstration model in Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, will open 60 of its units in downtown Moscow in a matter of weeks. Here are three of the best micro-hotels proving that size isn't everything. Yotel: . Yotel has operated its pod hotels in London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports since 2007, and in Amsterdam's Schiphol since 2008. Described by the company as being ""inspired by first-class airline cabins,"" and by one user review as ""a cross between a train compartment and a space ship,"" these small units pack in single or double beds, entertainment systems, a work desk and an en suite bathroom into between 7 to 10 square meters. The cabins --32 at Heathrow, 46 at Gatwick and 57 at Schiphol -- cost about Â£25 ($39) for four hours, or about Â£60 ($93) overnight. Yotel also operates a hotel based on a similar concept in New York City, with 669 slightly larger rooms. Yotel marketing director Jo Berrington said the airport cabins had very high occupancy rates, and the company planned to roll out its operations in other airports soon. See also: World's best airport restaurants . Napcabs: . Napcabs are 4-square-meter, self-service booths operating in Terminal two of Munich Airport. Six cabins are currently in operation, with plans to add more in coming months. They contain a bed, desk, air conditioning, internet access and a TV. The minimum charge for their use is â¬30 ($38), which buys two hours between 6am and 10pm, or three hours outside those times. The company says it is moving to other airports shortly. Sleepbox: . The cozy, 4-square-meter Sleepbox contains a maximum of three bunk beds, bedside tables, electrical outlets, and reading lamps and can be equipped with a television and alarm clock. A model Sleepbox was installed in the Aeroexpress terminal of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport in August, and will be put into commercial use in coming weeks when 60 are installed for use in downtown Moscow. The Sleepbox's designers envisage the units will also be used in train stations, shopping malls and exhibition centers. They can be booked for as little as 30 minutes; Sleepbox recommends a usage charge of U.S. $15 an hour. See also: Techy hotels a hit with geeky guests . Minute Suites: . Minute Suites provides private rest spaces for travelers to relax, nap or work inside the security areas at two U.S. airports. Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport has hosted the micro-rooms since late 2009. Philadelphia International Airport also installed 13 suites in 2011. Standard features include a daybed sofa and an HD television. A desk, phone, office chair and Wi-Fi internet connection ensures each suite can also act as a makeshift office space. A minimum one-hour stay costs $30, while every 15 minutes thereafter is charged at a rate of $7.50. SnoozeCube: . Situated in Terminal one of Dubai International Airport, SnoozeCube offers a compact and soundproof room complete with bed, touchscreen TV and internet access. There are currently 10 units in operation and a one-hour stay costs as little as $16. All SnoozeCubes are connected to the airport's flight information system to ensure that passengers do not miss their flights.","Airport micro hotels let travelers sleep in cabins rented by the hour .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- As street protests and voter skepticism rose over Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election victory, the incumbent leader hailed the vote, saying it was a ""great ordeal"" but one that pointed ""the way to the future."" Moussavi supporters run past a burning bus in Tehran on Saturday. ""The people of Iran inspired hope for all nations and created a source of pride in the nation and disappointed all the ill wishers,"" Ahmadinejad said in a nationwide TV address Saturday night. ""This election was held at a juncture of history."" The government said on Saturday that Ahmadinejad won Friday's presidential election with 62.63 percent of the vote and Mir Hossein Moussavi received 33.75 percent of the vote. But while he extolled the result and the huge turnout, Moussavi and supporters in the Tehran streets are crying foul as street clashes have erupted in the aftermath of the polls. Reaction emerged across the world, as countries such as the United States and Canada voiced concern over claims of voter irregularities. The ongoing street protests have been viewed as remarkable in a country where anti-government sentiment is not looked upon kindly by those in power. In the aftermath of the vote, street protesters and riot police engaged in running battles, with stones thrown, garbage cans set on fire and people shouting ""death to the dictatorship.""  Watch angry protesters take to streets Â» . People leaned out of windows and balconies to watch the throngs of protesters march, many of whom were Moussavi supporters and conducted largely noisy but peaceful demonstrations. Later in the evening, an agitated and angry crowd emerged in Tehran's Moseni Square, with people breaking into shops, starting fires and tearing down signs. Two sides of people faced off against each other in the square, throwing rocks and bottles and shouting angrily. Observers believe the two sides could be supporters of Ahmadinejad on the one, and Moussavi on the other. Before the vote count ended, Moussavi issued a sharply worded letter urging the counting to stop because of ""blatant violations"" and lashed out at what he indicated was an unfair process. Moussavi said the results from ""untrustworthy monitors"" reflects ""the weakening of the pillars that constitute the sacred system"" of Iran and ""the rule of authoritarianism and tyranny."" Independent vote monitors were banned from polling places. ""The results announced for the 10th presidential elections are astonishing. People who stood in long lines and knew well who they voted for were utterly surprised by the magicians working at the television and radio broadcasting,"" Moussavi said in his statement. Iran, he said, ""belongs to the people and not cheaters."" But Ahmadinejad said ""it was clear what a majority people wanted."" ""The elections in Iran are really important. Election means consensus of all people's resolve and their crystallization of their demands and their wants, and it's a leap toward high peaks of aspiration and progress. Elections in Iran are totally popular-based move that belongs to the people with a look at the future, aimed at constructing the future."" He indicated progress through consensus, saying economic and infrastructure reforms can be accomplished in Iran through a collective process. ""All of us can join forces,"" he said. Analysts expected Moussavi, widely regarded as a reformist, to do well. After a presidential debate between Moussavi and Ahmadinejad riveted the nation, Moussavi's campaign caught fire in recent days, triggering massive street rallies in Tehran. What officials have called an unprecedented voter turnout at the polls Friday had been expected to boost Moussavi's chances of winning the presidency. But Ahmadinejad -- despite being blamed for Iran's economic turmoil over the past four years -- maintains staunch support in rural areas.  Watch as Ahmadinejad is declared the winner Â» . The voter turnout surpassed 80 percent, at least two officials said on Saturday. Iran's Interior Minister Seyed Sadeq Mahsouli said 85 percent of the country's 46 million eligible voters had gone to the polls Friday. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei lauded the ""epic"" event. ""The 12 June election was an artistic expression of the nation, which created a new advancement in the history of elections in the country,"" Khamenei said. ""The over 80 percent participation of the people and the 24 million votes cast for the president-elect is a real celebration which with the power of almighty God can guarantee the development, progress, national security, and the joy and excitement of the nation."" Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said the level of participation of Iranians who reside abroad increased 300 percent in the election, Iranian media said. Moussavi was the main challenger among three candidates who had been vying to replace Ahmadinejad. The others were hard-liner Mohsen Rezaie, the former head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards and former parliament speaker and reformist Mehdi Karrubi, who called the declared results of the elections are a ""joke"" and ""astonishing."" Technology has been a key tactic in politically mobilizing young people in Iran, but text messaging has not been working in Iran over recent days. However, Iranian protesters still arrived en masse at meeting places around Tehran on Saturday.  Watch CNN review the unprecedented online presence of candidates Â» . Khamenei indicated that Iranians should take a deep breath in the aftermath of the vote. ""The Saturday after the election should always be a day of affection and patience,"" he said. ""Both the supporters of the elected candidate and the supporters of other respectable candidates should refrain from making any provocative and doubtful behavior. The respectable president-elect is the president of all the people of Iran and everybody, including yesterday's rivals, should protect and help him.""

"(CNN)  -- Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East, has been treated for early stage prostate cancer and says recent screening tests have delivered ""very positive"" news. Gen. David Petraeus was diagnosed with prostate cancer in February. He was diagnosed in February, his office said, and underwent two months of radiation treatment at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. ""My cancer was caught very early,"" Petraeus, 56, said in remarks released by his office. ""I've had two PSA tests since completing treatment five months ago, and they've both been very positive. Surgery to remove the prostate was not an option due to plates/screws that were used to repair my pelvis after it was fractured in a parachuting accident."" PSA tests are blood tests performed to screen for prostate-specific antigens -- proteins produced by cells of the prostate. Higher levels of PSAs could signal prostate cancer or benign prostate conditions. At an appearance Tuesday after news of the treatment was out, Petraeus made only a lighthearted comment about this health. ""With the CNN reports today, they're all just here to see if the guy's still alive or not,"" said Petraeus, joking about the camera crews recording his speech at the Association of the United States Army meeting in Washington. He did not comment further on his condition. The treatment had ""minimal impact on his work schedule as he was spending 4-5 days a week in Washington, D.C., for various policy reviews and other Pentagon activities at that time,"" the statement said. Petraeus made at least one overseas trip during the radiation treatment. He regarded his illness a personal matter and kept it largely private because it did not interfere with his duties, the statement said. However, the president, vice president, secretaries of state and defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were notified of Petraeus' condition, the statement said. Petraeus leads U.S. Central Command and is the overall head of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Gen.

"Washington (CNN) -- Retired U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus, who served as the top U.S. commander in Iraq and Afghanistan, was sworn in Tuesday as the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Petraeus -- sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden at the White House -- succeeds Leon Panetta, who is now the secretary of defense. At a ceremony marking his retirement from the military last week, Petraeus said his journey with the military was not coming to an end, even though he and his wife were ""about to begin an exciting new journey with another extraordinary organization."" President Barack Obama has cited Petraeus' experience in working with the CIA on counterinsurgency efforts in the field as a reason for his nomination as the agency's director. As the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Petraeus was dubbed ""King David"" for turning around what seemed like a losing battle. He took over in Afghanistan in July 2010 after the retirement of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, whose departure came on the heels of unflattering remarks he made about administration officials in a Rolling Stone magazine article. On July 18, Petraeus handed over Afghan command to Gen. John Allen. Petraeus graduated in 1974 from West Point and began his career as a second lieutenant in the infantry. He went on to become arguably the most influential general of his generation, and Esquire magazine called him one of the most influential people of the 21st century. ""I wanted this job,"" Petraeus said at his Senate confirmation hearing. ""I am taking off the uniform I have worn for 37 years to do this the right way.""","NEW: Petraeus is sworn in as CIA director .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's Washington's version of the reality television show ""Wife Swap."" President Barack Obama has tapped one of the country's top military men to head the Central Intelligence Agency, while the current CIA chief is being nominated to take charge of the military. The decision to send Gen. David Petraeus to the CIA and shift CIA Director Leon Panetta to the Pentagon is as much a reflection of the political skills of two talented bureaucratic infighters as it is a sign of the administration's shifting agenda in a variety of hot spots around the world. Faced with a looming reelection campaign and tighter budget constraints, Obama wants to move ahead with plans to complete the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq and begin the process of winding down the unpopular war in Afghanistan, according to numerous analysts. New fiscal and political realities are contributing to a growing emphasis on smaller, more flexible, less costly, and potentially more dangerous military and paramilitary engagements in the years ahead. Translation? A smaller Defense Department that is more reliant on solid intelligence gathering, and an increasingly militarized CIA more heavily involved in armed conflicts. Panetta and Petraeus are, by all accounts, uniquely qualified to manage the change. Obama shuffles familiar faces in key security roles . ""This team will provide the leadership to help make our nation safer,"" said South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key congressional voice on security matters. ""I could not be more pleased with these selections."" The post-9/11 wars have made Pentagon and CIA coordination ""essential,"" former CIA Director John McLaughlin told CNN. ""It hasn't always been that smooth, but over time we've learned from experience."" Panetta, 72, has been described as the consummate Washington insider. He took over at the CIA in February 2009, and previously served as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton between 1994 and 1997. Prior to that, the California Democrat served as director of Clinton's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) -- a position that, by definition, requires mastery of tricky fiscal situations and an understanding of the federal government's sprawling bureaucracies. As of February, more than 1.4 million people were serving in the U.S. armed forces. Panetta also served in the House of Representatives from 1977 to 1993, a period in which he established deep congressional ties. His friendships and institutional knowledge of Capitol Hill will be critical in terms of helping to mold congressional opinion and balance Pentagon priorities against growing deficit fears. In taking charge of the Defense Department's changing missions, Panetta will ""deal with it the way he dealt with issues at the CIA,"" McLaughlin said. ""He'll seek the facts."" Over the last couple of years, Panetta has ""had to make difficult decisions on which there were no easy answers,"" McLaughlin added. ""That's pretty good schooling for the kinds of decisions he is going to have to make at the Pentagon, where ... difficult choices are going to be necessary."" For his part, Petraeus already has an ""intimacy with the (CIA's) capability,"" McLaughlin said. ""He knows its strengths. He knows whatever shortcomings it may have. He knows the people very well. He knows what buttons to push."" Petraeus, 58, assumed command of the NATO International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and U.S. Forces Afghanistan in July 2010, after serving for more than 20 months as commander of the U.S. Central Command. He has worked with the CIA in helping to oversee the military's predator drone strikes against extremists in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Bennett: Why Panetta, Petraeus are smart choices . Petraeus also previously commanded multi-national forces in Iraq, leading the so-called ""surge"" -- the deployment of more U.S. troops and the implementation of new strategies to reverse setbacks and make strides to defeat the insurgency and end the war. Over the years, he has retained enormous popularity and respect in the halls of Congress. During his time commanding the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center and Fort Leavenworth, he oversaw the development of the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual. Petraeus, analysts note, already has a close relationship with intelligence sources around the broader Middle East, including Libya, Egypt, Yemen, and a host of other pivotal countries. In that respect, he will have little trouble transitioning to the CIA's traditional role of intelligence gathering. One major change for the general, McLaughlin notes, is that the CIA director typically does not make policy. The head of the CIA ""basically defines the situation as it exists on the ground (and) informs policy, but stops short of actually recommending policy,"" he said. ""Gen. Petraeus will be moving into a job that has a somewhat less prominent policy role than the jobs he has had in the past."" Former CIA Director Michael Hayden said a key cultural difference waiting for Petraeus is that, unlike the military, ""folks at the CIA don't get the hierarchy thing real well. He will be faced with a degree of informality with which he is unaccustomed."" Hayden, however, didn't see that aspect of the transition as a particularly large hurdle. At the CIA, Petraeus will find a culture of ""patriotism, service, sacrifice, (and) value of group before self,"" he said. It is ""a culture with which he will have great comfort."" CNN's Pam Benson, Tom Cohen, and Barbara Starr contributed to this report .","Gen. David Petraeus has been tapped to head the CIA .
CIA Director Leon Panetta has been nominated to lead the Defense Department .

"Tens of thousands of Russians turned out in central Moscow and across the country Saturday to protest what they believe were rigged parliamentary elections. United Russia, the party of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, suffered big losses in the election, but retained its parliamentary majority. On Saturday, protesters chanted ""Putin out,"" according to a correspondent from state-run RIA Novosti news agency. Between 20,000 and 25,000 protesters had gathered in the capital, Moscow, Ria Novosti said Saturday, citing police. There have been no reports of unrest and security has been tight. iReport photos: Thousands of protesters in Moscow . Vladimir Ryzhkov, co-chairman of the Party of People's Freedom, said 40,000 people had massed and some 10,000 were headed to the main protest venue, the news agency reported. Rally organizers and Moscow city officials agreed to allow demonstrators on Bolotnaya Square in Moscow Saturday. The event has been authorized to hold 30,000 people, yet tens of thousands more have indicated that they want to attend. The protesters are demanding an annulment of the December 4 election results and a new vote. Election officials on Friday released the official results: 238 seats for United Russia; 92 seats for the Communists; 64 seats for Fair Russia; and 56 seats for the Liberal Democrats. Protesters say that these results are fraudulent. Putin said Russians have the right to assemble peacefully and legally. Hundreds of protesters were arrested during demonstrations earlier this week.  Police said they cracked down on those demonstrations because the turnouts were not legal and the protesters were being disorderly. Demonstrators turned out in other parts of the country. RIA Novosti correspondents said around 1,000 people ralled in the southern Siberian city of Barnaul. Protests occurred in Krasnoyarsk, Vladivostok, Chita and Khabarovsk in eastern Russia. A demonstration also was planned for St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city.","Protests are taking place in Moscow and other cities .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Gen. David Petraeus, the outgoing top commander of the NATO forces in Afghanistan, formally  transferred authority Monday to incoming commander Marine Corps Gen.  John Allen. Several senior Afghan and NATO officials, including U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen, attended the change-of-command ceremony in Kabul. ""Throughout, we will keep our eyes on the horizon -- the future  of Afghanistan, "" Allen told the audience, "" a nation of free people at  peace, governed under its constitution, pursuing economic enterprise and  development, in a secure and stable environment free from the extremism and  terrorism that has plagued this wonderful country and its people for more than a  generation. In the end -- together we  will prevail."" He inherits a force that is coming under renewed attack just as NATO prepares to begin the first phase of handing over provincial security to Afghan security forces. On Monday, three service members with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force were killed in a blast in eastern Afghanistan. Their deaths bring to 34 the number of international troops who have died in Afghanistan in July.. Since the start of this year, 314 coalition soldiers have died in the country. For his part, Petraeus plans to retire from the Army at the end of August and assume the CIA director's job September 6. ""I wanted this job,"" Petraeus, 58, said at his Senate confirmation hearing. ""I am taking off the uniform I have worn for 37 years to do this the right way."" Dubbed King David for turning around what seemed like a losing battle as top U.S. commander in Iraq before he went to Afghanistan, Petraeus  is considered a top general in his era, with Esquire magazine naming him one of  the most influential people of the 21st century. He took over in Afghanistan on July 4 last year  unexpectedly after a Rolling Stone magazine article prompted the  resignation of Gen. Stanley McChrystal. ""We've jokingly said that I went to the White House for the monthly  National Security Council meeting on Afghanistan and Pakistan with  President Obama, and came out with a new job,"" Petraeus said. ""And  that's not far from the truth."" The U.S. military is losing the architect of modern-day counterinsurgency operations. Petraeus wrote his doctorate dissertation on the lessons America learned in Vietnam. Later, he devised the Army/Marine field manual, challenging the military to think differently about how it relates to the civilian population in dealing with a bloody insurgency. This week, ahead of his departure, Petraeus assessed the results of his strategy in Afghanistan. ""What we have done is implement the so-called NATO comprehensive approach, a civil-military campaign ... that does indeed embody many of the principles of the counterinsurgency field manual that we developed back in 2006, and which we employed in Iraq in the surge of 2007-2008,"" he said in an interview with NATO-TV. ""I think generally, it has borne fruit."" He said it has been a difficult journey, rife with setbacks, but coalition forces have halted the momentum of the Taliban in much of the country and reversed the insurgent hold in restive Helmand province. Petraeus' experience in working with the CIA on counterinsurgency efforts in the field was cited as a reason for his nomination as the spy agency's director.

"Whether they get a charge out of lunching beside an Oscar-winning actress or are simply using her choice of venue like a glorified Yelp review, people love supping with celebrities. Restaurants love them too. Problem is, publicizing ""celebs eat here"" information only ensures that the guests of honor never return.

"Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called for unity as he appeared headed for a third term as president, declaring victory in an ""open and honest fight"" in Sunday's election. But chess champion-turned-opposition activist Garry Kasparov accused Putin's supporters of ""massive fraud"" early Monday by packing the polls with additional voters. With better than two-thirds of the vote reporting early Monday, Putin led his closest rival by a nearly 4-to-1 margin. His margin of victory was smaller than in 2004, the last time he ran for president, but appears well above the 50% needed to avoid a runoff. ""We have won an open and honest fight,"" Putin told the cheering and flag-waving supporters who had braved the cold in Manezhnaya Square for hours to hear his expected victory speech. The results show ""that our people are ready for renewal, and have only one aim."" ""We are appealing to all people to unite for our people, for our motherland, and we will win,"" he said. ""We've had a victory! Glory to Russia!"" The 59-year-old former KGB officer served two terms in the Kremlin before term limits forced him to step down in 2008. But he served as prime minister under his successor, Dmitry Medvedev, and continued to dominate Russian politics. With more than 68% of boxes reporting, Putin had just under 65% of the vote in a field of five candidates. His closest challenger, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, had slightly more than had 17%; the other three candidates -- including billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, the owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team -- were running in the single digits. Critics have long accused Putin of undermining Russia's democratic institutions during his years in power, and accusations of voter fraud in December's parliamentary elections have led to unprecedented public protests against his government. But Ivan Zassoursky, a media analyst at Moscow State University, told CNN the demonstrations may have helped Putin consolidate his support. ""He was able to mobilize his core electorate -- the workers, the blue-collar workers, the state workers -- all the people that the state pays salaries to, all the people that the state gives order to, like industrial complexes,"" Zassoursky said. ""I think they all have been shaken and stirred by the fact that the opposition has so many people, that they are so vocal, and I think this has pulled them into action."" But opposition figures said they planned to continue their demonstrations as early as Monday, fueled by new complaints about Sunday's results. Kasparov, who served as a poll watcher in his Moscow neighborhood, said Putin's supporters ""simply added new voters to the register using so-called supplementary voter rolls."" ""At one of the polling stations, the number of extra voters even exceeded the number of registered voters,"" he said. And Ilya Ponomarev, a member of parliament and a prominent protest figure, said he did not feel there was a fair counting of votes. Many polls before the vote, he said, showed Putin receiving around 40%. ""Mr. Putin remains to be one of the most popular politicians in the country, probably the most popular politician in the country, and it's quite natural that he's receiving the majority of the votes,"" Ponomarev, of the A Just Russia party, told CNN from Moscow's Red Square. ""But it should not be an overwhelming majority, and I think there has to be a runoff."" But in the run-up to Sunday's voting, Putin's spokesman played down the public protests over the past three months. ""It's pure mathematics,"" Dimitri Peskov said. ""Yes, we have something like 70,000 people out there (protesting) on Sakharov Avenue, but at the same time we have to keep in mind they are a minority. The majority of the population does not live here in Moscow. We have a huge country and if we look eastwards, we'll see lots and lots of big cities, small towns and rural populations that still support Putin pretty well."" Three policemen were killed in an attack on a polling station in Russia's southern republic of Dagestan after voting closed Sunday, police spokesman Alexander Gorovoy said. One of the attackers, who all wore masks, was also killed, he said. Violence has plagued the republic for years, with Islamist rebels fighting Moscow rule in the region, and Gorovoy said the Interior Ministry would vigorously investigate the attack. Of Putin's opponents, Prokhorov -- Russia's third-richest man -- was the only fresh face in the pack. Zyuganov is a serial election loser now facing his fourth defeat, while right-wing candidate Vladimir Zhirinovsky and left-leaning Sergey Mironov also have run and lost previous campaigns. On paper, Prokhorov 's manifesto of democratic and economic reforms should have appealed to many of Moscow's voters, but he struggled to shake a reputation of being too close to the regime. Cynics call him a Kremlin project, a candidate designed to credibly attract the middle-class vote without posing a genuine threat.","Putin declares an ""open and honest"" victory, but opponents cry foul .

"Soccer's world governing body expects the 2018 World Cup to be a catalyst for social change in Russia, despite apparently anti-gay statements by the head of the organizing committee. But FIFA told CNN Tuesday that it was seeking clarification on the adoption of new laws in Russia which ""prohibit propaganda on non-traditional sexual relations"" around minors. The legislation also bans symbols symbols such as rainbow flags and has led to calls for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and the 2018 World Cup to be boycotted. Alexey Sorokin, CEO of the latter competition, defended the new laws, saying they had been misinterpreted. ""It is designed against active propaganda of homosexuality, not against homosexuality itself. That is a big difference,"" he was quoted in an article by World Football Insider. ""Would you like a World Cup where naked people are running around displaying their homosexuality? The answer to that is quite obvious."" ""The Olympics and World Cup are not a stage for various views -- not for Nazis, not for any other ways of life. It should be about football and nothing else."" FIFA said that its statutes had ""zero tolerance against discrimination based, among other, on sexual orientation"" and trusted that the 2018 hosts would deliver on their promise to provide all visitors and fans with a warm welcome. ""FIFA is firmly convinced that the staging of the World Cup can contribute to uniting people and having a positive social impact,"" it added. The International Olympic Committee (IOC), under pressure to act ahead of next year's Winter Games, has publicly opposed any moves to stage boycotts, but told CNN it is keeping a watching brief on developments in Russia. ""This legislation has just been passed into law and it remains to be seen whether and how it will be implemented, particularly as regards the Games in Sochi,"" it said. ""To that end, the IOC has received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games."" Russia won the right to host the 2018 World Cup at a vote in December 2010 and pledged to build 13 new stadiums as part of a near $5 billion plan. Billions will also be spent on improving infrastructure for the expected influx of tourists and football fans for the global competition.","FIFA wants clarification on adoption of new 'anti-gay' laws in Russia .

"Bravo to you, Robert Downey Jr. The actor has transformed from a man who fans once feared would lose his life to substance abuse to a megastar who also happens to be a devoted husband and father. The wisecracking playboy daredevil has taken a back seat to a witty man enthralled with the woman in his life and clearly focused on his work. Sound familiar? It's hard to tell whether Robert Downey Jr. is channeling Tony Stark or whether moviegoers are buying into the actor's portrayal of ""Iron Man"" because the character is not that much of a stretch. And we aren't the only ones who think so. EW posed the question ""Anyone else got a sneaking suspicion that Robert Downey Jr. and Tony Stark are actually the same person?"" in a story about his 2013 appearance on ""The Daily Show."" With the Internet going gaga over reports that the actor is in final negotiations to appear as Iron Man in ""Captain America 3,"" we can yet again marvel at the fact that there was a time when Downey was beyond down and out in Beverly Hills. In fact, he was pretty much the Lindsay Lohan of his time: an incredibly talented artist who seemed to attract trouble the moment he stepped out the door. Report: Robert Downey Jr. to suit up for major role in 'Captain America 3' He reportedly had his first experience with drugs at age 6 when his father, director Robert Downey, gave him a toke of marijuana (years later, the elder Downey would confess to regretting that decision.) In the 1980s, roles in films like ""Less Than Zero"" and ""The Pick-up Artist"" gave him honorary status in the Brat Pack, a group of hot young actors who dominated the movie scene. He also had a highly publicized romance with Sarah Jessica Parker, who would go on to find fame as the star of ""Sex and the City."" But for all his luck in love and on screen (a turn as the iconic Charlie Chaplin in the 1992 film ""Chaplin"" earned him a best actor Oscar nomination) the dark side of show business resulted in multiple arrests for everything from driving under the influence to gun possession. ""It's like I have a shotgun in my mouth, and I've got my finger on the trigger, and I like the taste of the gunmetal,"" the actor famously told a judge in 1999. His lifestyle not only took a toll on his reputation (he became fodder for jokes when in 1996, after a night of partying, he wandered into a neighbor's home in Malibu and fell asleep in a child's bed), it helped end his relationship with Parker. ""I was so selfish,"" he said in a 2008 interview. ""I liked to drink, and I had a drug problem, and that didn't jibe with Sarah Jessica, because it is the furthest thing from what she is. She provided me a home and understanding. She tried to help me. She was so miffed when I didn't get my act together."" Even a stint on the then very popular show ""Ally McBeal"" didn't stop his addiction, and in 2001, he was fired from the series after yet another drug arrest. But like Tony Stark, Downey wrapped himself in the armor of his work and pulled himself out of the depths of addiction. By 2005, he had critics raving with his performance in films like ""Wonder Boys"" and ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang."" That same year he married producer Susan Levin, whom he met when she served as a producer on the 2003 movie ""Gothika."" Levin (now Susan Downey) told Harper's Bazaar that she made it clear to her now-husband that he would have to clean up his act. ""I did meet Darth Vader (what she calls his troubled persona), for like a minute,"" she said, ""right after the movie wrapped, and I said immediately, 'This isn't gonna work.' I made it clear that to stay with me, nothing could happen."" The couple became parents of a son in 2012 and announced in July 2014 that they were expecting their second child. Downey also has an older son from a previous marriage. Celebs expecting in 2014 . Such stability has clearly helped Downey reach the pinnacle where there is awards buzz for his new film ""The Judge."" It's no wonder Buzzfeed produced a piece titled ""32 reasons Robert Downey Jr. is the most perfect man in the universe."" ""You're very handsome; don't let anyone tell you different,"" Jimmy Kimmel said to the actor, to which he responded: ""They don't."" ""Iron Man"" co-star Gwyneth Paltrow went so far as to rank Downey's Stark above another popular movie superhero, the ""Man of Steel."" ""(Tony Stark's) gorgeous,"" Paltrow said. ""I'm still not convinced with the man in tights and the cape."" And with all Downey's toughness, resilience and charm, it's no wonder ""The Daily Show's"" Jon Stewart had a straight face when he told the actor, ""You are Iron Man. You are.""","Robert Downey Jr. has transformed his life .

"(CNN) -- Teams in southern Japan are searching for an award-winning U.S. poet and college professor who failed to return from a hike to a volcano, his university said Thursday. Craig Arnold was doing research for a poetry and essay book on volcanoes, a colleague said. Craig Arnold, a 41-year-old assistant professor at the University of Wyoming, did not return from his Monday hike to a volcano on Kuchinoerabujima, a small island just west of Yakushima, the school said. ""The only clues that [searchers] have found were indications that he had begun the ascent -- footprints on the trail,"" said Peter Parolin, head of the university's English department, citing Arnold's family. Arnold, a creative writing professor, was doing research for a poetry and essay book he is writing about volcanoes, Parolin said.  See where island is located Â» . A team of 60 people, with helicopters and search dogs, is looking for Arnold, according to the school. Japanese authorities have agreed to continue the search through Sunday, the university said. Arnold, according to the school, wrote two award-winning volumes of poetry: ""Shells,"" chosen for the Yale Series of Younger Poets in 1999; and 2008's ""Made Flesh."" His work has been anthologized in several volumes of the Best American Poetry Series, and his awards and honors include a Fulbright Fellowship and the Joseph Brodsky Rome Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, according to the university. Arnold took the semester off from teaching and traveled to Japan alone through a U.S.-Japan creative artists' fellowship, Parolin said. He had planned to spend a day alone at the volcano, and an innkeeper contacted authorities when he didn't return that evening, according to Parolin. Arnold has scaled many volcanoes, Parolin said. ""If it's technical or dangerous, he does it with a guide. But from all reports, on this trip he went by himself,"" Parolin said. Arnold ""is the kind of person and poet who is attracted to extreme places and extreme geographies -- places that not all of us visit,"" the University of Wyoming English department head said. ""He feels the need to go to places that people don't go and come back and tell us about them,"" Parolin said. A press officer at the U.S. Embassy in Japan said he couldn't confirm whether Arnold was missing, citing privacy law. However, he said the U.S. Air Force sent four Okinawa-based helicopters to the area Thursday at the embassy's request to assist with what he believed was a search operation on Kuchinoerabujima. The Air Force helicopters, from Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, were on an unrelated mission in the area when they were diverted, he said.","Award-winning poet Craig Arnold disappears after starting hike to Japanese volcano .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The FBI for the first time has placed an animal rights activist on the bureau's ""Most Wanted Terrorists"" list. Daniel Andreas San Diego is 31 years old and a ""strict vegan,"" the FBI says. The FBI announced Tuesday the addition of Daniel Andreas San Diego to the list, hoping a burst of international publicity associated with the move will help investigators find him after six years on the run. San Diego, 31, may appear to be out of place on a terrorist list with familiar names like al Qaeda's Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and Adam Yahiye Gadahn. The ""strict vegan,"" according to the FBI, is charged with bombing two corporate offices in California in 2003. The blasts caused extensive property damage but no deaths. Vegans eat no meat or any other food containing animal products. Authorities allege San Diego bombed facilities in Emeryville and Pleasanton, California, because he believed the Chiron and Shaklee Corporations had ties to animal-testing labs. The sophisticated homemade bombs had ammonium nitrate brand explosives and relied on ""kitchen timer style mechanical timer devices,"" according to an FBI affidavit. After both bombings, e-mails from a group called ""The Revolutionary Cells-Liberation Brigade"" claimed responsibility for the acts. Photographs of San Diego, who grew up in suburban San Francisco, California, show a well-groomed, bespectacled man. But the computer network specialist also sports several elaborate tattoos. According to an artist's rendering of the body art, San Diego has one in the center of his chest of a burning hillside and the words ""It only takes a spark"" in a typewriter-style font. An abdominal tattoo shows burning and collapsing buildings, while his back features a leafless tree rising from a road above buildings that are burning but still standing, the FBI says. Last year, agents pursued reports that San Diego was hiding in Costa Rica. They also received a report he was spotted in rural southern Virginia.","FBI is searching for animal rights activist Daniel Andreas San Diego .

"(CNN) -- An Egyptian who was once a Special Forces officer has been chosen ""caretaker"" leader of al Qaeda in the wake of Osama bin Laden's death, according to a source with detailed knowledge of the group's inner workings. Al Qaeda's interim leader is Saif al-Adel, who has long played a prominent role in the group, according to Noman Benotman. Benotman has known the al Qaeda leadership for more than two decades. He was once a leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), a militant organization that used to be aligned with al Qaeda, but in recent years renounced al Qaeda's ideology. Benotman told CNN that based on his personal communications with militants and discussions on jihadist forums, al-Adel, also known as Muhamad Ibrahim Makkawi, had been chosen interim chief of al Qaeda because the global jihadist community had grown restive in recent days about the lack of a formal announcement of a successor to bin Laden. U.S.: Bin Laden communicated with Yemen group . According to Benotman, this was not a decision of the formal shura council of al Qaeda, because it is currently impossible to gather them in one place, but was rather the decision of six to eight leaders of al Qaeda in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area. Al-Adel was already one of the top leaders of the group. However, Benotman said, the choice of an Egyptian may not sit well with some Saudi and Yemeni members of al Qaeda, who believe bin Laden's successor should come from the Arabian Peninsula, a region that is holy to all Muslims. Bin Laden was from a wealthy Saudi family. The presumed successor to bin Laden is his long-time deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is also Egyptian. Benotman, who has long been a reliable source of information about al Qaeda, said the temporary appointment of al-Adel may be a way for the leadership to gauge reaction to the selection of someone from beyond the Arabian Peninsula as the group's leader. Al-Adel fought the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s. After the fall of the Taliban in the winter of 2001 he fled to Iran. According to senior Saudi counterterrorism officials, from there al-Adel authorized al Qaeda's branch in Saudi Arabia to begin a campaign of terrorist attacks in the Saudi kingdom that began in Riyadh in May 2003, a campaign that killed scores. Some reports in the past year have suggested that al-Adel had left Iran for Pakistan. Pakistan announces key al Qaeda arrest . One of the key issues that al-Adel has to reckon with now is the fallout from the large quantities of sensitive information that was recovered by U.S. forces at the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where bin Laden was shot on May 2. That information is likely to prove damaging to al Qaeda operations. The selection of an interim leader allows al Qaeda to begin the process of collecting allegiance, or baya, from al-Qaeda affiliates such as the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the North Africa-based al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Baya was a religious oath of allegiance to bin Laden rather than to the organization itself, in the same way that Nazi Party members swore an oath of fealty to Hitler rather than to Nazism. That baya must now be transferred to whomever the new leader of al Qaeda is going to be, which is likely to be al-Zawahiri, given his long role as bin Laden's deputy. Opinion: Why bin Laden was radicalized . However, there is scant evidence that al-Zawahiri has the charisma of bin Laden, nor that he commands the respect bordering on love that was accorded to bin Laden by members of al Qaeda. Now that bin Laden is dead there is a real opportunity for the Taliban to disassociate itself from al Qaeda, as it was bin Laden who, sometime before the 9/11 attacks, swore an oath of allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Omar as the Amir al-Muminin, ""commander of the faithful,"" a rarely invoked religious title that dates from around the time of the Prophet Mohammed. Mullah Omar could now take the position that the new leader of al Qaeda does not need to swear an oath of allegiance to Omar as commander of the faithful. Such a move would satisfy a key condition for peace talks with the U.S. and Afghan governments: that the Taliban reject al Qaeda, something that they have so far not done. Al-Adel has been involved in militant activities since the late 1980s, according to an interview with him published in spring 2005 in the Arabic-language London-based daily Al-Quds al-Arabi. In the article, written by Fuad Husayn, a Jordanian journalist and writer, al-Adel recalled that he was detained for militant activities in Egypt on May 6, 1987. Al Qaeda's most-wanted leaders . ""The case pertained to the assassination attempt against ex-Egyptian Interior Minister Hasan Abu-Basha. ... I was then a colonel in the Egyptian Special Forces,"" he said. Al-Adel also has been involved for years in anti-American activities, other sources indicate. Mohamed Odeh, one of the bombers of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya in August 1998, told FBI interrogators that in 1993 he was ordered by al-Adel to go to Somalia to link up with local tribes and train them to fight and attack U.S. forces who were then serving there in a humanitarian mission to feed starving Somalis. And a British-Ugandan, Feroz Ali Abbasi, who had trained in an al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan before 9/11, recalled in a memoir that Adel instructed him and other recruits to fight U.S. forces around Kabul or in the southern city of Kandahar during the American invasion of Afghanistan in the fall of 2001 . In the interview published in Al-Quds al-Arabi, al-Adel also explained al Qaeda's motivations for the 9/11 attack: ""Our main objective, therefore, was to deal a strike to the head of the snake at home to smash its arrogance."" After the fall of the Taliban, Adel recalled that he and other members of al-Qaeda found refuge in Iran: ""We began to converge on Iran one after the other,"" he said. ""...We began to rent apartments for the fraternal brothers and some of their families. The fraternal brothers of the group of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar"" -- an Afghan militant then living in exile in Iran who is now a leader of the insurgency in Afghanistan -- ""offered us satisfactory help in this field. They provided us with apartments and some farms that they owned."" But Al-Adel said that the Iranians subsequently arrested a large number of these ""brothers.""","Noman Benotman says Saif al-Adel is the ""caretaker"" leader of al Qaeda .

"It's official. Sen. Ted Cruz is now a citizen of the United States -- and the United States only. If you remember, the Texas Republican was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father.  As such, he was a dual citizen -- an American because of his mother, and Canadian because the country, like America, grants automatic citizenship to anyone born there. No harm in that, except Cruz is considered a potential candidate for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. And when the news of his dual citizenship surfaced last year, thanks to a Dallas Morning News piece, some began to question his eligibility to become president. (In truth, that was never in jeopardy. Most legal experts said Cruz qualifies as a ""natural born citizen,"" a requirement for the White House job, as stated in the Constitution.) The newspaper piece came as a revelation to Cruz as well. ""Because I was a U.S. citizen at birth, because I left Calgary when I was 4 and have lived my entire life since then in the U.S., and because I have never taken affirmative steps to claim Canadian citizenship, I assumed that was the end of the matter,"" Cruz said at the time. Then he took immediate steps to renounce his Canadian citizenship. Well, that process was formally completed last month, and he received a letter in the mail this week telling him so, the newspaper reported Tuesday. ""This is to certify that the person named above has formally renounced Canadian citizenshp and pursuant to the Citizenship Act will cease to be a citizen on"" May 14, 2014, the letter read. ""it's official y'all,"" tweeted his spokeswoman Catherine Frazier.

"Need outside help to feed your family? You're in solid company. A new survey reveals that one in seven Americans -- more than 46 million people -- relies on charitable programs and services to get the nutrition they need to remain healthy. The quadrennial Hunger In America report was funded by The Howard G. Buffett Foundation on behalf of the nonprofit hunger assistance group Feeding America, and compiled from answers to confidential surveys filled out by over 60,000 individual recipients of food aid and 32,000 surveys completed by the group's network agencies. The results paint a portrait of an America still struggling to meet its most basic needs in the wake of an economic downturn. The survey was conducted during a historically high demand for food assistance, with unemployment and poverty rates remaining high after 2008's recession. While the number of households receiving nutrition assistance from the federal government's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (previously known as food stamps) increased by approximately 50% between 2009 and 2013, the report found that this was matched by radically increased need for outside charitable resources. How to feed your family from a food bank . So who is going hungry? Children, military families and the long-term unemployed -- and it's taking a toll on the nation's health. ""The results from this historic study are truly alarming. Many of the people we serve struggle not only to get enough to eat, but also to keep a roof over their heads, the lights on in their homes, and to cover their  healthcare and medicine costs,"" said Bob Aiken, CEO of Feeding America, in a statement. The federal government defines ""food security"" as all people in a household having enough food for a healthy lifestyle at all times. According to a 2012 USDA report, more than one in seven households reported not meeting that criteria at some point during that year. Around 7 million of those included a family member who skipped meals or went hungry so that other members could have enough to eat. Of the households included in the Hunger In America survey, 66% reported having to choose between paying for food and paying for medicine or medical care, 79% of households purchased the cheapest food available, even if they knew it wasn't the healthiest option. Thirty-three percent of those households include a member with diabetes and 58% include a member with high blood pressure -- both conditions are linked to poor nutrition. How do you stretch your food dollars? While SNAP provides some relief for the lowest-income families and vulnerable populations such as seniors, children and pregnant and post-partum women, the nation's 7% unemployment rate between late 2008 and late 2013 added significantly to the number of food insecure households. Many families considered ""working poor"" received no federal assistance because a member's employment, full-time or partial, nudged them over the maximum income allowed to qualify, even if others were unable to find employment. It falls to charitable organizations, such as Feeding America's network of 200 member food banks to make up the shortfall. The group assists more than 46 million people annually, including 12 million children and 7 million seniors. Ten percent of its adult clients are students, and 20% of the families served include an active duty or veteran member of the military. Among all of Feeding America's clients, 43% are white, 26% are black, and 20% are Latino. While just over half (55%) receive some assistance from SNAP, one in five survey participants indicated that they never applied for benefits because they assumed that they would not qualify. Opinion: SNAP isn't about a 'free lunch' On the national level, Aiken's group secures food from corporate manufacturers, retailers and suppliers, as well as government food supplies, and distributes them throughout its network, which encompasses all 50 states as well as Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Feeding America also provides its local networks with $30 million worth of grants annually, and assists with individual food banks' efforts to secure donations from local businesses. Nearly 2 million volunteers provide the muscle -- 8.4 million hours' worth -- for the network's outreach each month, serving 3 billion meals over the course of the year. Still, hungry Americans are left with hard choices about how to keep their families healthy. A query of Eatocracy readers in the wake of last November's SNAP cuts that left 47 million people with $36 a month less to spend on food revealed both innovation and sacrifice from both food bank volunteers and patrons alike. ""Soup is always good. You can make 10 servings of good hearty and filling soup for less than $10. Buy day or two old bread for toast, bread pudding or a breakfast. Many stores sell baked goods at a discount price once they are a day or two old. Purchase packed meats on their expiration day. You can often save $3-5 on such a meat package,"" wrote one respondent via Facebook. Another emphasized the importance of advance planning, writing, ""I'm homeless and I am still able to buy food and sometimes even meat! Why, because because I think about what I can buy before I get to the store with the money that I have! Aldis, Dollar General and Walmart are my usual choices. Hint, shop at the outside aisles because these are where the cheaper brands and clearance items usually are. I can forage for food better than most, so I leave the welfare for the welfare moms!"" In Aiken's eyes, the struggle for healthy food is one that all Americans must first acknowledge, and then help shoulder. ""The Hunger in America 2014 findings demonstrate the urgent need for all of us to address hunger in our communities,"" said Aiken. ""This data provides a factual basis for decisions about how we as a nation approach hunger relief and protect our most vulnerable citizens.""","In the wake of 2008's economic downturn, a survey shows Americans are still struggling .

"Captured American Warren Weinstein looks tired and pale and speaks in steady monotone in pleadiang for his freedom to President Barack Obama. In a video released by al Qaeda on Christmas Day, he says he feels abandoned and forgotten since his abduction more than two years ago. ""The years have taken their toll,"" Weinstein, 72, says in the 13-minute video. He says he is not in good health and that he suffers from acute asthma. He appeals to Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry, the media, the American public and finally his family. ""Nine years ago, I came to Pakistan to help my government and I did so at a time when most Americans would not come here,"" he said. ""And now, when I need my government, it seems I have been totally abandoned and forgotten."" CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the video, which was first posted on The Washington Post website. It was the second apparent proof of life in which Weinstein makes a direct plea to the Obama administration. The first was released in May 2012. ""The U.S. government is working to verify the authenticity of the recently released video of Warren Weinstein,"" the FBI said in a statement. ""We remain concerned for the safety and well-being of Mr. Weinstein and remain in contact with Warren Weinstein's family while we continue to monitor the situation."" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf reiterated the government's call for Weinstein to be released. U.S. officials have repeatedly said Washington will not bargain with al Qaeda. Weinstein was abducted August 20, 2011, from his home in Lahore, Pakistan, shortly before he was planning to return to the United States. Gunmen posing as neighbors offered food, then pistol-whipped Weinstein and his driver and tied up his guards, according to U.S. Embassy and Pakistani officials. In the latest video, Weinstein is dressed in a light gray track suit jacket and a black cap. He looks very different from when he was captured; he is gaunt and has a salt-and-pepper beard. ""Needless to say, I've been suffering deep anxiety every part of every day, not knowing what is happening to my family and not knowing how they are and because I am not with them,"" Weinstein said. His appearance alarmed Laurie Wiseberg, who is a friend and former colleague of Weinstein. ""Quite honestly, I didn't recognize him in the picture. He has changed so dramatically from the person he used to be in terms of appearance and I would hope something could be done so he has a chance to be reunited with his family, his wife, his children and grandchildren, and not have to die in a foreign country far away from those he loves,"" Wiseberg told CNN's Don Lemon. Wiseberg said she last spoke to Weinstein's wife ""some months ago and she was quite in despair, but hoping very much that he would in fact be released."" In the video, Weinstein said his captors have agreed to let his family visit him, but only if Obama agrees to do the same for al Qaeda members held by the United States. ""Unless you continue to try to get President Obama and his administration to actively pursue my release, we may never see each other again,"" he said. Weinstein was employed by J.E. Austin Associates Inc., a U.S. consulting firm based in Arlington, Virginia, that is a USAID contractor. He is a world-renowned development expert, according to the company's website. No one else appears in the latest video of Weinstein. In it, he appeals to Obama as a family man. ""I am, therefore, appealing to you, on a humanitarian basis, if nothing else, in asking that you take the necessary actions to expedite my release and my return to my family and to my country. Our country."" Toward the end, he focuses on his wife and family. ""I would like them to know I love them very much and I think about each and every one of them every moment of every day of my captivity."" Weinstein's wife, Elaine, who lives in Rockville, Maryland, was not immediately available for comment.","A friend of Weinstein's said his appearance has changed dramatically .

"The critical moment for Sen. Ted Cruz and his allies came around 7 p.m. on Tuesday night. The Texas Republican's suit was still crisp, despite more than four hours into what would become a rhetorical marathon of more than 21 hours on the Senate floor aimed at derailing Obamacare. But until that point, the brunt of the speaking had been done by Cruz and his ally, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.  Without more help, Lee's aides weren't sure how long the effort could continue. Then Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, arrived. It was a sign that they'd get the bodies they needed for the long haul. ""When he showed up, we had a feeling that we could go until noon (the next day),"" said Lee spokesman Brian Phillips. Lee was on or near the floor all night. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who held the floor for 12 hours in March, jumped in. Even ideological opponent Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, shouldered some speaking time while trying to refute Cruz' points. That gave Cruz some time for mental breaks even though he couldn't leave the floor to eat, use the restroom or do anything else. For material, staff pulled together binders of articles, talking points and documents that could be used to fill time.  And as social networks heated up, aides ferried in a stream of tweets for Cruz to read. But to the big and less comfortable question: How did he manage physically? Good, pliable shoes, for a start. Cruz left his trademark Ostrich boots behind and told the chamber that he picked up some sneakers in preparation for the long hours of standing. No food. Senate rules ban anyone from eating on the chamber floor. So that is easy. Dehydration. CNN Senior Congressional Producer Ted Barrett asked Cruz how he stood for more than 21 hours without having to use the men's room. ""Drinking very little water,"" he replied. That surely is part of it.  But we do not know if anything else was involved, as has been the case in the past. The Senate's marathon speech record-holder, the late Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, reportedly set up a bucket in the Senate cloakroom next to the chamber and used it while keeping one foot on the Senate floor, so as to retain his speaking position. Former Sen. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee used some kind of bag during his portion of a filibuster, according to an oral history from former parliamentarian Floyd Riddick. It did not end well. ""That's always a defining issue, how much stamina a person has,"" said Senate Historian Don Ritchie, who recorded the oral history with Riddick and says there is a tradition of senators using a contraption for bodily functions during speech-a-thons. Cruz was on the Senate floor just 1 hour and 41 minutes short of a day. ""I don't know of any special thing he used,"" said Phillips. ""And he didn't indicate there was anything."" Then he paused. ""That's one of those things that is so personal that there are only a couple of people who know.  And they will probably take it to their graves."" Cruz' office did not respond to CNN's request for more details.","Some tense moments not long into the 21-hour speaking marathon; then Rubio showed up .

"Alisa Weinstein was thrilled when she heard about Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's release. She hopes her father will be next. Gunmen abducted Warren Weinstein nearly three years ago from his home in Lahore, Pakistan. They posed as neighbors, offered food and then pistol-whipped the American aid worker and tied up his guards. Now he's being held by al Qaeda. And as political backlash over the controversial prisoner swap for Bergdahl grows, Weinstein's daughter says her happiness for the soldier and his family has turned to worry. ""We started to realize that the administration is going to be a lot less likely to do this again if it causes some political problems for them,"" she told CNN's ""AC360"" on Wednesday. ""So does that mean that the door is closed for us?"" For years, when Warren Weinstein's case came up, U.S. officials called for his release but repeatedly said Washington wouldn't bargain with al Qaeda. Now, Alisa Weinstein says it's clear that negotiating is an option. ""They have shown with this exchange that they can get this done. If they want to, they can do this,"" she said. ""So I know that they can do it for us and they can do it for others."" Just as health was a concern for U.S. officials who negotiated Bergdahl's release, Weinstein says she's worried about her 72-year-old father's health. He has a heart condition and severe asthma, she said, and a video of him released by al Qaeda on Christmas showed he's suffering. ""It was clear from that video that he is not in good physical condition. He was incredibly pale and gaunt. His voice was weak. ... My father is certainly not in good health,"" she said. Listening to Obama administration officials justify the swap by pointing out that Bergdahl was a soldier doesn't ease her worries. ""My father is just as deserving of freedom as Sgt. Bergdahl, as are all of the Americans who are being held abroad,"" she said. ""You cannot distinguish between these hostages. ... They can't just pick and choose, decide that it works to get one person out and then leave everybody else there."" Just a few months after Weinstein's capture, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a recording claiming the terror group was holding Weinstein -- and demanding, among other things, an end to airstrikes by the United States. He described the captive as ""a former employee and a current contractor working with the U.S. government in its aid program to Pakistan, which aims to fight the jihad in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and just like the Americans arrest any suspect linked to al Qaeda and the Taliban, even if they were far related."" Weinstein was employed by J.E. Austin Associates Inc., a U.S. consulting firm based in Arlington, Virginia, that is a USAID contractor. He is a world-renowned development expert, according to the company's website. In the video al Qaeda released of him in December, Warren Weinstein said he felt abandoned. ""Nine years ago, I came to Pakistan to help my government and I did so at a time when most Americans would not come here,"" he said. ""And now, when I need my government, it seems I have been totally abandoned and forgotten.""
