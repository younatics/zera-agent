"New York (CNN) -- The body of Marie Colvin, a veteran correspondent for The Sunday Times of London who was killed in a shelling attack in the Syrian city of Homs, will likely be buried inside Syria, her mother said Saturday. Rosemarie Colvin said aid workers, who have been trying for days to remove her daughter's body from the war-ravaged country, tried again Saturday but ultimately determined that the situation was too dangerous. ""We were told yesterday that today was probably the last day,"" the elder Colvin said. She added that she believes her daughter was deliberately targeted by Syrian government forces. The younger Colvin, 56, a New York native who was the only British newspaper journalist inside the Homs neighborhood of Baba Amr, was killed alongside French journalist Remi Ochlik in a bombing attack earlier this week. ""They were first in another house, and the top floors there were blown off,"" the elder Colvin said. ""First (the Syrian forces) rocketed the front of the building,"" she said, fueling suspicion that the attack against a makeshift media center where Colvin and Ochlik were holed up was no accident. The Syrian government was not immediately available for comment. The day before she was killed, Colvin had given media interviews to networks like ITN and CNN about the ongoing clashes in Homs, and about a child who was killed in the city. ""The baby's death was just heartbreaking,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""We just watched this little boy, his little tummy, heaving and heaving as he tried to breathe. It was horrific. My heart broke."" Colvin reported Tuesday that there was ""constant shelling in the city"" and that the child's death was ""just one of many stories"" in violence-wracked Homs. ""It's chaos here."" Journalists and activists have been sneaking into Syria in an effort to report on the protests and clashes that have persistently challenged the authority of President Bashar al-Assad. Colvin said graphic images like that of the dying child, who was reportedly struck in the chest by a piece of shrapnel, needed to be shown. ""Something like that I think is actually stronger for an audience, for someone who's not here, for an audience for which the conflict, any conflict, is very far away. But that's the reality,"" she said. The siege of Baba Amr, where 28,000 civilians are ""hiding, being shelled, defenseless,"" Colvin reported, has become a flashpoint of the country's bloody year of violence. ""That baby probably will move more people to think, 'What is going on and why is no one stopping this murder in Homs that is happening everyday?'"" ""There are no military targets here,"" Colvin reported, refuting Syria claims that its forces are only hunting terrorists. ""It's a complete and utter lie,"" she said of the government's response. ""The Syrian Army is basically shelling a city of cold, starving civilians."" A day later, Colvin and Ochlik were killed. Colvin, a Yale graduate renown for reporting on war's more human consequences, had for years worked in conflict zones and high risk areas, despite losing an eye in 2001 during a grenade attack in Sri Lanka. Since her death, her family has started a fund in her honor. ""We felt we had to do something so there was a place that people could donate,"" said family member Michael Colvin. The Marie Colvin fund is intended to direct resources to support charities that her family says she would have supported.","Marie Colvin's mother says she believes her daughter was targeted .

"(CNN) -- Rescuers were searching Friday for nearly 120 people unaccounted for after a passenger ferry sank off the east coast of Papua New Guinea, authorities said. The 238 known survivors arrived by five vessels at the city of Lae. Many were undergoing medical tests, according to Capt. Nurur Rahman, rescue coordinator with the country's National Maritime Safety Authority. About 350 people were aboard the MV Rabaul Queen when it sank Thursday, said Rahman. The MV Rabaul Queen went down about 16 kilometers (10 miles) off Cape Fortification in the Vitiaz Strait after getting into trouble early Thursday, officials said. The ferry is about 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) below the surface, Rahman said. After an alert was sent out, boats and helicopters rushed to the scene to try to save scores of people left adrift at sea by the sinking. They had to deal with high winds and ocean swells. Joanne Meehan of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority told CNN two of that country's aircraft were assisting in the search. Australia is Papua New Guinea's closest neighbor minus Indonesia, with which it shares a border. ""I'm pleased that a large number of people have been rescued,"" said Kevin Rudd, the Australian foreign minister. ""We're deeply concerned about those who are still missing."" Rudd said he didn't have any information on the nationalities of the passengers aboard the ship. ""This is a difficult operating environment,"" he said. ""We are doing everything within our power."" The Rabaul Queen was ferrying passengers from the town of Kimbe on New Britain Island to Lae when it got into difficulty. ""Taking ferries is the most economic method of transport for people traveling between the islands and the mainland,"" Rahman told CNN. ""What I understand from local media is that a lot of students and their parents were traveling to schools that recently reopened on the mainland."" Jurgen Ruh, the chief executive of Manolos Aviation Ltd. in Lae, was in one of the helicopters that helped with the rescue effort. ""I could see the survivors on the debris,"" he said, noting that the passenger ship had sunk completely by the time he reached the scene. There were about 10 life rafts visible, each with roughly 10 people on them, the first time his helicopter flew overhead, he said. However, when the helicopter returned to the area after refueling, no more survivors were spotted. The weather was likely to be a contributing factor in the ferry's sinking, Ruh said, as there were high winds at the time in what is a notorious area. Papua New Guinea had a population of 6.7 million in 2010, the U.S. State Department says, with about 190,000 people living in Lae. Most of the population is scattered in small settlements across the state's many islands. The largely Christian country is part of the Commonwealth and has Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. The bulk of the estimated 2,000 American residents in Papua New Guinea, are missionaries and their families, the State Department says. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph, Karen Smith, Jethro Mullen, Phil Gast, Laura Smith-Spark and Judy Kwon contributed to this report.","NEW: Vessel is about 3,280 feet below the surface .

"Bend, Oregon (CNN) -- Far from the glamour of Madison Square Garden, aboard a FedEx delivery truck in this small Oregon town, sits the one man who saw Jeremy Lin coming. ""I've always had a mind for numbers, the statistical side of sports,"" Ed Weiland explained. He spends his days as a driver for FedEx, but once he punches out, he goes to work at his true passion: finding the best college basketball players in the country. He publishes his assessments on the sports blog hoopsanalyst.com. In 2010, he chose Harvard senior Lin as his top point guard prospect, when no one else was paying much attention to the Ivy Leaguer. Weiland never even saw Lin play, basing his assessment solely on stats. Read Weiland's 2010 prediction . He breaks out every possible statistic when analyzing a player. He keeps all the information in an elaborate spreadsheet on an old Toshiba laptop in his modest apartment. Weiland said Lin caught his eye because of his high two-point field goal percentage and his ability to rebound, steal and block. ""If you can do that at a high level in college, it probably means you are a dominant player,"" he said. ""How often your team wins depends on putting it in [the basket] the most efficiently, and that's what the two-point percentage is a measure of."" Weiland found it intriguing that no one else seemed to be paying attention to Lin. ""I look for underdogs, but the player has to be good. I won't specifically say I'm going to find myself an underdog, because Jeremy Lins don't happen every year,"" Weiland explained. ""But when they do, you want to be ready to say, 'This is a guy we should look at.' "" Outside of the online world of ""stat heads,"" as amateur analysts call themselves, no one paid much attention to Weiland's 2010 assessment. Lin wasn't even picked in the NBA draft. He played briefly for the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets, but he was cut from both teams without making much of an impact before being picked up by the New York Knicks in late 2011. Opinion: Linsanity vs. Tebowmania . As Lin bounced around the league, Weiland monitored his progress. ""I kind of kept an eye on him. That's what I do with players like that,"" he said. Then one morning in early February, he went online to check some NBA scores and he saw a headline that read ""Linsanity."" He knew his prospect was taking off. A victory over Kobe Bryant and the LA Lakers kicked Linsanity into high gear. ""After the Lakers game, the original article I wrote went viral,"" he said. Articles in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times have fueled interest in Weiland. His phone hasn't stopped ringing with reporters from across the country. FedEx is giving him time off to handle news requests. ""When I led the 2010 preview off with Jeremy Lin, the idea was that if and when he broke out, there might be some notoriety there,"" he said. ""I obviously never expected anything like this for him or for me."" It's all a bit much for a 51-year-old vegan who tries to live a simple small-town life. ""I'm having fun with it. I'm trying to be careful to be the same guy I've always been, because I did like that guy, and I want to continue to be that guy,"" he said. Weiland sees himself as an underdog in the world of sports analysis, just like Lin is an underdog in the NBA. He has never been in contact with Lin but would like to meet him one day. Until then, he has a message for the young basketball star as he makes his way through the ""Linsanity"" that surrounds him: . ""Just keep playing the way you've been playing.""","FedEx truck driver Ed Weiland predicted Jeremy Lin's success two years ago .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China is calling on the Syrian government and others involved to ""immediately"" stop violence, particularly against innocent civilians, and pursue a political solution to the Middle East nation's grim and bloody yearlong crisis. The position is one part of a six-point framework ""for realizing a political solution"" issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry early Sunday. ""It is deeply worrying that the situation in Syria remains grave,"" the statement said. ""China follows closely the developments of the situation in Syria, firmly maintains that the current crisis should be resolved through political dialogue in a peaceful and appropriate manner, and has made unremitting efforts to this end."" China has not been in lockstep with the West and Arab nations on how to stop the deadly Syrian crackdown on protesters and the fighting. Government security forces and a range of opposition fighters, including the Free Syrian Army, are among those that have been battling. China and Russia vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution last month that called for President Bashar al-Assad to step aside. China has been opposed to pushing through a regime change and disagrees with the use and threat of sanctions against Syria. The United States, the European Union, Turkey and the Arab League have planned and initiated such sanctions. Because of the veto, world powers formed an initiative to tackle the crisis through a group called the Friends of Syria, which met recently in Tunisia. Here are the other points in China's statement: . -- China said it welcomes the appointment of a joint special envoy to the United Nations and the Arab League to pursue a political resolution. Kofi Annan, the former U.N. secretary-general, has been named to the post. China also backed Arab League and Arab world efforts to pursue a political solution. -- The Beijing government said an immediate and ""inclusive political dialogue"" should be launched among all the parties ""with no preconditions attached or outcome predetermined."" The joint special envoy to the United Nations and the Arab League should be ""impartial"" mediators and the sides should agree on a ""detailed road map and timetable for reform."" -- China expressed support for the United Nations' ""leading role"" in the coordination of relief efforts. It said the United Nations or another impartial entity should assess the humanitarian situation ""under the precondition of respecting Syria's sovereignty."" China said it opposes interference in Syrian internal affairs under a humanitarian pretext. -- The international community should respect Syria's ""independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity"" and ""provide necessary and constructive assistance for the various political factions of Syria to launch dialogue, and respect the outcome of dialogue."" ""China does not approve of armed interference or pushing for 'regime change' in Syria, and believes that use or threat of sanctions does not help to resolve this issue appropriately,"" the statement said. -- The U.N. Security Council should ""strictly abide by the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter and the basic norms governing international relations,"" it said. "" As a permanent member of the Security Council, China is ready to earnestly fulfill its responsibilities, engage in equal-footed, patient and full consultation with other parties on the political solution to the Syrian crisis in an effort to safeguard the unity of the Security Council,"" the statement said.","China is against armed interference or pushing for regime change .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday it had detained shipments of orange juice and concentrate from Brazil and Canada after finding traces of the unapproved fungicide carbendazim. The agency discovered the substance in 11 shipments, six from Canada and five from Brazil. The FDA said it had detained nine of the shipments because companies behind two of the shipments withdrew their import request. The fungicide is allowed in limited quantities across Europe and Latin America, but the United States banned its use in 2009. The levels found by the FDA are below international maximum levels. Earlier this month, the FDA temporarily halted all orange juice imports after low levels of carbandazim were found in some juice shipments from Brazil. It later declared that the juice posed no health risks, but that it would analyze all incoming shipments for even trace elements of the banned fungicide. The controversy has sent orange juice prices skyrocketing. Brazil is the world's biggest exporter, accounting for 85% of total global exports. The United States is its second-biggest market after Europe. The FDA has collected samples from 80 shipments of orange juice. So far, 29 have tested negative for carbendazim.","U.S. government detains orange juice sent from Brazil, Canada .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Questions swirled Sunday about what caused iconic singer Whitney Houston's sudden death, with authorities offering little information at a time when many were still struggling to come to grips with the news. While an autopsy was complete as of late Sunday afternoon, Assistant Chief Ed Winter of the Los Angeles County Coroner's office said it could take six to eight weeks before the results are in on toxicology and other tests. ""There was no visible signs of trauma, and foul play is not suspected at this time,"" Winter said, adding that ""the cause of death right now is deferred."" More official details on the investigation aren't expected to surface anytime soon, after the Beverly Hills, California, police department was granted a ""security hold."" Common in high-profile cases, this puts limits on what can be revealed about a probe. Authorities have said that police and fire officials were called to Houston's room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel at 3:43 p.m. Saturday after her bodyguard found her unconscious body in a bathtub. Winter, from the coroner's office, said Houston was removed from the tub before paramedics performed CPR. She was pronounced dead at 3:55 p.m. Pill bottles were found at the scene, entertainment news website TMZ reported, citing ""informed sources."" CNN could not immediately confirm the TMZ report and Winter declined to comment. Whatever the exact cause, the grief about the death of Houston -- whose soaring voice and enormous talent were clouded in recent years by her battles with drug addiction -- was evident Sunday at the 54th annual Grammy awards show, which is typically the biggest night on the music industry's calendar. After a performance by Bruce Springsteen, Grammy host LL Cool J began his monologue by acknowledging ""we've had a death in our family"" and offering a prayer thanking God ""for sharing our sister Whitney with us."" ""Although she's gone too soon, we remain truly blessed to have been touched by her beautiful spirit and to have her lasting legacy of music to cherish and share forever,"" the rapper and actor said. Earlier, on the red carpet, Kim Burrell told CNN she'd exchanged voicemails with her good friend Houston shortly before her death, describing her as being ""in great spirits, as always."" She always thought of Houston as a ""fighter"" and a ""survivor,"" which made the idea of her passing all the more difficult to comprehend. ""She's my sister and she'll always be my sister,"" said an emotional Burrell, herself a singer. ""I love her dearly."" Burrell said she'd flown to California to join Houston in attending a pre-Grammy party Saturday night hosted by the songstress' longtime mentor, Clive Davis. Houston never made it, dying at the age of 48. Amid the outpouring of grief, Beverly Hills police said Houston's 18-year-old daughter, Bobbi Kristina, was taken to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, at about 11:15 a.m. Sunday. Details of her condition were not disclosed. A source close to the family told CNN that by late Sunday afternoon the teenager was out of the hospital and would be heading back to New Jersey possibly as early as Sunday night. She was expected to go to the home of her grandmother, gospel singer Cissy Houston, in New Jersey, the source said. Bobbi Kristina Brown was born during Houston's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, which ended in divorce in 2007. Burrell said she was with the teenager late Saturday, admitting the girl had felt ""overwhelmed"" while expressing confidence that ""she'll pull through."" Her father, Bobby Brown, did not perform at a scheduled New Edition concert Sunday night in Nashville in the wake of his ex-wife's death, said Candy Lowd, a promoter for the concert. The previous night, he was openly emotional during a concert in Southaven, Mississippi, said attendee and CNN iReporter Moshiu Knox, at one point asking people to say a prayer for his daughter, for his mother and ""for me, because I'm going to need it."" ""Bobby was crying during his performance and at one point had to walk off stage,"" Knox said. Houston's battles with drugs had long made headlines, but she was in the midst of a comeback, with a few shows scheduled and a movie in the works. ""I did really get the sense that she was really trying to make a comeback,"" megachurch pastor T.D. Jakes, executive producer of Houston's upcoming movie ""Sparkle,"" said Sunday. ""And I think that the reason that so many people are devastated is because it is not just her music, but it is her misery that attached itself to the hearts of Americans, and we watched her struggle to regain her footing after a tumultuous relationship and bouts with abuse and substance abuse. ""I think the believability of her human struggle made her song and her acting that much more powerful because we recognize that often it is the caged bird that sings,"" Jakes said. Fans: Houston's music spanned an era . A music industry executive, who recalled hearing two loud booms from the room below hers -- the room where, she later learned, Houston had died -- said she had seen Houston and Bobbi Kristina swimming in the hotel pool days before. The two looked happy, she recalled, and Houston seemed healthy and beautiful. However, it remained unknown whether the singer had won her battle with substance abuse for good. Houston had performed as late as Thursday night at a pre-Grammy event in the area, singing a raspy rendition of ""Jesus Loves Me"" with singer Kelly Price. Music exec: Houston looked 'healthy and beautiful' days earlier . Houston's family said in a statement Sunday, ""We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Whitney. This is an unimaginable tragedy and we will miss her terribly. We appreciate the outpouring of love and support from her fans and friends."" Grief flows at hotel where Houston died . Her fans remembered her in her prime on Sunday, when she reigned as pop queen during the 1980s, selling some 170 million albums, singles and videos. ""Perhaps now Whitney can rest in everlasting life without the harsh judgment that she felt in this world,"" said CNN iReporters Kimberly and Betty Kiel from Pearland, Texas. And in the church where Houston grew up, the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey, members gathered to honor her. As a young girl, Houston grew sang solos in the choir at the church. Her mother served as director of sacred music at the church for 54 years and is still a member there. Whitney Houston was born in Newark in 1963 and was soloing in the junior choir by age 11, according to the All Music Guide. ""Whitney's mother and cousins nurtured her passion for gospel music since birth,"" according to Houston's official website. Her cousins include singers Dee Dee Warwick and Dionne Warwick, and her godmother was Aretha Franklin. Franklin told CNN on Sunday that the news of her goddaughter's death is ""almost unbelievable."" ""It's stunning, absolutely stunning,"" the iconic performer said. ""I could not believe what I was reading ... It's a sad day, a very sad day."" Sorrow at church where Houston got her start . The Rev. Jesse Jackson was among those attending the service in Newark. ""Whitney is a winner,"" he told reporters outside the church. ""Her singing, her inspiring people around the world, it's been a great source of joy and uplift. And so we grieve, and yet we rejoice even in our grieving."" Houston's career: A regal rise, a tragic fall . Jackson said he spoke to Cissy Houston on Saturday night and Sunday morning and headed to her home after the service. ""They're having to process this,"" he said of Houston's family. ""This was not some long, debilitating sickness. This was sudden. And so when this happens, there's no rational explanation, just you have to cling to your faith and hold on until the morning comes."" CNN's Ashley Hayes, Denise Quan, Casey Wian, Jessica Thill, George Howell, Holly Yan, Poppy Harlow and Deb Feyerick contributed to this report. Michael Martinez reported from Los Angeles and Greg Botelho from Atlanta.","Grammy host LL Cool J lauds Whitney Houston's ""beautiful spirit""

"(CNN) -- When you look to buy airline tickets later this week, it might seem like prices have shot up. For once, that's not actually the case. Higher advertised fares are the result of new Department of Transportation rules that are going into effect under the banner ""Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections #2."" Higher prices shown up front is one of the four main changes that you'll see when the the new rules go into effect starting Tuesday, so let's talk about what will happen. Full fare advertising . On some airline websites and in ads, you've probably seen fares displayed as a certain amount plus taxes and fees. That's a pretty common thing throughout society, but the DOT has decided that it's unacceptable for airline travelers. Beginning Thursday, the advertised price has to be the total price including any mandatory per passenger taxes and fees. Let's say that there's a sale for $59 each way between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Now, the airline can advertise it as $59 each way plus taxes and fees.  On Thursday, it will have to be shown as $69.80 each way. This applies to advertisements, but more importantly, it applies to reservation websites. They can no longer show just the base fare in the search results. This may seem a little strange since it's not the case in other industries. Hotels still show base rate before taxes and fees, for example. But this is how the DOT wants the airline industry to work. Wondering what exactly is included in this new fare? Fuel surcharges must be included in the rate (as has been the case for years anyway) and any mandatory fees. Of course, most of the fees people see adding up today are optional fees, like baggage charges, and those can still be broken out. There are, however, a slew of regulations impacting them as well. Fees become more prominent and standardized . The DOT has decided to regulate optional fee disclosure to make pricing clearer, but unfortunately, the new rules might end up doing the exact opposite. A couple of things make good sense. If there is a change in bag fees or baggage allowances, the airlines must prominently display a link to the change on their homepages for at least three months. Airlines will also have to make available a complete list of rates for all optional services, from pillows to food and drinks. While airlines have to get into specifics for bag fees, the rest can be listed in ranges of fees, making the information somewhat less useful. These changes sound good, but then the DOT steps up disclosure where it might hit the point of overload. Under the new rules, anytime a fare quote is given, airlines have to let passengers know that ""bag fees may apply."" In addition, when a ticket is purchased, the airline must include in the e-ticket receipt, a complete list of all possible bag fees and allowances. That means detailing different rules for elite frequent fliers, different rules by class of service, etc. If you're wondering where they'll put it, it will undoubtedly go into the fine print at the bottom that nobody reads anyway because there are already too many disclosures down there. One actual victory for travelers here centers around which bag fees get charged when a traveler is booked on codesharing airlines for trips beginning or ending in the U.S. Today, if you buy a ticket on, say, American, but your first flight is on its codeshare partner Etihad, then the baggage rules on Etihad usually apply. The new rule means that the policies of the marketing airline, in this case American, apply regardless of who is operating the flight. That sounds good, but in practice it's going to be very difficult to implement and enforce. No more opt-out . If you've ever bought a ticket from an ultra low-cost airline like Allegiant or Spirit, you might have found yourself frustrated by the dreaded ""opt-out"" procedure. You know how it works. The travel insurance or some other optional service might be automatically checked. If you don't want it, you have to uncheck it before you continue or it will be charged. This rule makes that illegal going forward.  All optional services will be ""opt-in"" only. No price increases after you buy . This might sound silly, but fares can no longer be increased after tickets have been purchased. Has this been a problem? No. But it does prevent Allegiant from doing something that travelers might have liked. Allegiant had discussed the idea of giving travelers the choice of two fares. One would be higher, but would not change. The other would be lower, but would go up if the price of fuel went up. So it would simply tie a piece of the fare to the cost of fuel. If people wanted to take a gamble on fuel prices, they could buy the lower fares. That, however, is no longer an option. But it really is minor since the option wasn't yet offered anyway. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brett Snyder.","New rules require airlines to roll mandatory taxes and fees into advertised fares .
Optional fees must be more clearly listed, which Snyder says may create confusion .
Baggage fees will be subject to more stringent disclosure rules ."
"UYUNI, Bolivia (Reuters) -- On the edge of the world's biggest salt desert, villagers optimistically scrawl ""salt for sale"" signs on their mud brick homes. In backyards, mountains of the stuff are heaped like year-round snow drifts. The sparse beauty of Bolivia's Salar di Uyuni is attracting growing numbers of tourists. But mining salt is no longer the only way to survive in this cold, arid corner of southwestern Bolivia. The Salar de Uyuni is becoming a must-see for adventurous visitors to South America, changing at least some fortunes in the poor village of Colchani. ""There's nothing here apart from salt... Tourists used to arrive and they wouldn't buy anything, so we thought, 'How can we improve things?""' said Fermin Villca, who now sells ashtrays and llama figurines carved from salt stone. Stretched between distant Andean peaks like a shimmering white carpet, the Salar de Uyuni is home to pink flamingos, 1,000-year-old cacti, rare hummingbirds and hotels built entirely from blocks of salt. Earlier this year, leading travel publisher Rough Guides listed the Salar as one of its top 25 wonders of the world, alongside far better-known attractions such as the Taj Mahal, Grand Canyon and Great Wall of China. And word is spreading. At least 60,000 tourists visited the roughly 4,250-square-mile salt flat last year, and local officials say their numbers are steadily rising. Apart from freezing night temperatures and fierce desert sun, visitors have to brave a grueling journey on unpaved roads to reach the Salar, which lies about 185 miles south of the capital La Paz near the Chilean border. Some 40,000 years ago, it was part of a lake that covered a large swath of the Andean highlands. The moon-like landscapes of the salt desert are part of what was left when it dried up. In the nearby town of Uyuni, residents and local officials have ambitious plans for its future as a hub for tourism, which has fast overtaken llama-herding and quinua-farming as the impoverished region's main economic activity. At the recent start of a road-building scheme to link Uyuni with the city of Potosi, the provincial governor said he wanted Uyuni to be ""the world's top tourist city"" with the help of the highway and new attractions such as a llama museum. Even before the road has been paved, some officials have also proposed the construction of a high-speed railway using profits from the region's revitalized silver-mining industry. But with frequent power cuts, a lack of drinking water and only basic hotels, they admit they have a long way to go. ""There's no center to deal with the garbage. The wind blows and all the garbage ends up back in town,"" said Martin Calvimontes from the non-governmental organization Inagro, which is trying to promote better practice in tourism. For tourists who want to stay on the Salar itself, there are several hotels made from salt bricks -- beds, chairs and cocktail bars included. ""People want to test it's really made of salt by licking the walls,"" said Raul Garcia, a workmen building a new salt hotel, as he crammed coca leaves into mouth. ""They're very impressed when they see that it's all made from salt."" The view from the hotel's windows is flat whiteness, fringed by the peaks of mountains on the horizon beneath a bright blue sky. The silence of the Salar is only broken by the occasional tour group speeding by in a four-wheel-drive vehicle. Uyuni tourism director Ovidio Copa expects twice as many tourists to be visiting the Salar within five years as word of its otherworldly beauty gets out. ""The Salar has the ability to captivate people with its silence and tranquility,"" he said, sitting before the towering cacti of one of the salt flat's islands. ""Its intrinsic beauty is the attraction."" E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British couple who married in a lavish Second Life wedding ceremony are to divorce after one of them had an alleged ""affair"" in the online world.

"(CNN) -- Even before the explosions and blaze that killed Josh Powell and his two sons, a social worker feared the boys she brought for a supervised visit with their father were in extreme danger. Powell snatched the boys from her and slammed the door of his Graham, Washington, home as the smell of gasoline wafted in the air, the social worker told 911 operators. ""Josh Powell will not let me in the door. What should I do?"" She asked the dispatcher, her voice rising with anxiety. ""This could be life-threatening. He went to court Wednesday and didn't get his kids back. I'm afraid for their lives. ""Nothing like this has ever happened before at these visitations, so I'm really shocked. I can hear one of the kids crying,"" she said. The social worker's 911 conversations were part of several released by the Pierce County Sheriff's Department Tuesday. The tapes detail the chilling moments surrounding the Sunday deaths. Funeral for Powell boys set for Saturday . Authorities say Powell, who is also a suspect in the 2009 disappearance of his wife, Susan Cox-Powell, planned his sons' fiery deaths. Before the inferno Sunday, Alina Powell called police dispatchers to say she was worried about ""weird"" messages she had just received from her brother. ""He said something about he can't live without his sons. And goodbye,"" Alina Powell told the emergency operator. Through sobs, Powell told the dispatcher she was ""terrified to drive over there"" herself. ""I'm not afraid of him,"" she said. ""He's never hurt me. I'm afraid of seeing something I don't want to see."" After the blaze started, neighbors and acquaintances, some frantic and fearful, began calling the 911 center to rush help to Powell's home. One female neighbor told emergency operators that the home was engulfed in flames. ""There was a loud, huge boom. And there is crap flying all over the place. Dark smoke,"" the woman said. Jeff Bassett, Josh Powell's attorney, also called 911 after he received an e-mail from his client. ""I understand he may have had an explosion. I may have some information,"" he told the operator. ""Just if it was an accident or if it was more than that. I got an e-mail from my client and that e-mail gives me every indication that it was intentional. ... Basically, it says 'I'm sorry and goodbye.'"" Powell's boss called and said he also received an e-mail from Powell, saying goodbye. The social worker called back to 911 after the explosion to make sure it was understood that there were people in the home before the fire. ""There's two little boys in the house, they are 5 and 7, and there is an adult male and he had supervised visits and he blew up the house and the kids!""","Sheriff's department releases several 911 tapes .

"(CNN) -- Alex Ferguson looks like an old-school football manager. Renowned for his infamous ""hairdryer"" blasts at under-performing players, he has the well-worn visage you associate with huge stress levels and his admitted love for red wine. But the 69-year-old is much more than his gruff, often intimidating public persona, according to a man who has seen the Scot transform Manchester United's fortunes in the past quarter of a century. ""He was far deeper than that, more intelligent, more widely read, and he had a very clear idea of the modern game, the modern player and what the modern player needed to do,"" Ferguson's former adversary at Leeds, Howard Wilkinson, told CNN. Ferguson is a tough post-match assignment for any television interviewer and has become adept at using the media in his battles with contemporaries such as Arsene Wenger and Rafael Benitez. Ferguson's top 25 Manchester United moments . ""He's nothing like the person you see after the game, or interviewed. The only thing that's true about him in those situations is his sincerity and his desire to make sure that he gets his point of view across,"" said Wilkinson, who in 1992 was the last English manager to win the domestic league title. ""He's become one of the best. Sometimes he hasn't got the credit for it, where sometimes other people have. I think his use of the media has yet to be bettered."" Ferguson arrived at Manchester United in 1986, flush from his incredible success at Scottish football club Aberdeen, and he was disappointed by what he found. Has Ferguson tinkered too much this season? Appointed to replace Ron Atkinson on November 6, he inherited a squad of big-name internationals, a notorious drinking culture -- and the high expectations of a major club that had not won a league title in 19 years. He, on the other hand, had taken Aberdeen to three Scottish titles, five domestic cups and -- most impressive of all -- a European Cup Winners' Cup final triumph against the mighty Real Madrid in 1983. ""He came into a Manchester United which, he's said many times, surprised him -- it was a disappointing surprise,"" Wilkinson said. ""He told me a couple of weeks after he'd been there ... he got the players together on a Monday morning, and the summary of his conversation was, 'Listen, fellas, you're going to have to change, because I am not going to change.' ""What he inherited, he saw the potential but perhaps at that point hadn't realized how much he was going to have to do. In the early years it was difficult, but fortunately -- thanks to Matt Busby and one or two others at the club -- people had patience. ""Not only patience but also they had foresight. They realized they had a jewel in their hands."" That patience has paid off, as Ferguson has transformed United ahead of his 25th anniversary at the club this weekend. He can look proudly back upon 12 Premier League titles -- last season's was an English-record 19th for United -- plus two Champions League crowns, five FA Cups, four League Cups and a European Cup Winners' Cup. But, if he had been employed in these cut-throat days, Ferguson may not have lasted past his first five years in charge. It was widely speculated that he would be sacked if United lost to Nottingham Forest in an FA Cup tie in the 1989-90 season, but his team won that match and went on to clinch his first silverware at the club after a replayed final against Crystal Palace. Wilkinson, however, believes Ferguson's turning point came at that fateful team meeting years earlier, and everything else flowed from there. ""He walked out of that gym, and it was the beginning. Clearly, he didn't win all the battles, but he won the war,"" said Wilkinson, now chairman of the League Managers' Association. He credits Ferguson, a former union steward in the Glasgow shipyards, as one of the first in the line of modern managers who believe in high physical standards and a scientific approach. ""There was a drinking culture at a few clubs, and he and I shared many common values, and we both recognized that if you want to get the best out of your body as an athlete, then you couldn't keep abusing it,"" Wilkinson said. ""Changing culture at a place and changing behavior is the mark of a great leader. He's been there 25 years, and he's changed it permanently. That's what leadership's about."" Ferguson has a well-known love of racehorses -- he sued former United shareholder John Magnier over stud rights of a horse in 2003 -- but Wilkinson said his charity work is not so widely appreciated. ""He does go to great lengths to help those not as lucky as he is,"" Wilkinson said. ""He travels here, there and everywhere for charities. ... He's got his own charitable trust. ""I know that he is very good with young people who are starting out. He reads their letters and gives them far more consideration than others, because he recognizes the need to give youngsters that help."" After winning the first staging of the new Premiership format in 1993 to end United's long wait for the title, Ferguson famously introduced a new generation of young players at United, including David Beckham and Ryan Giggs; the latter he persuaded not to sign for rivals Manchester City as a teenager, and he is still at the club. He had also invested wisely in signing Eric Cantona from Leeds and midfield warrior Roy Keane from Nottingham Forest, both of whom had a major influence in United's new glory years. Keane believes Fergie's hunger to succeed is what has kept him at the United helm for so long, despite an aborted announcement that he intended to retire at the end of the 2001-02 season. ""Hunger. It's as simple as that,"" the Irishman told CNN. ""In football some players get a new contract, teams win a trophy, and you never hear from them again because they're made up. ""At United, for the players and supporters, it's all about the next game. Man United, over the past 20-25 years ... we never relaxed. We never thought we were done. It was let's win the next game, the next trophy. ""That's why I think the manager has been so successful. ... He's constantly looking at the bigger picture."" Ferguson's continued success has come under threat this season from United's big-spending local rivals Manchester City, including a humiliating 6-1 home defeat this month. But Wilkinson believes Fergie will bounce back from what he called his worst moment in football. ""He'll come back even more determined, if that's possible, than he ever was. For him to come out and say that publicly ... that will have cut him to the quick."" Ferguson's reign will not last forever, and Wilkinson believes United must prepare for a reversal in fortunes when he finally steps down. ""You won't be able to replace him. He is, in my opinion, the greatest manager that's ever been, and to think you can go out and pick someone who'll sit behind his desk and just pick up the reins as if nothing has changed -- that's very difficult,"" Wilkinson said. ""Whoever follows him will need to be the right person, but more importantly the people at the club will need to be patient, because that person is walking into perhaps the most solid culture in a business that there is anywhere in the world.""","Alex Ferguson celebrates 25 years as manager of Manchester United this weekend .

"(CNN) -- Unlike Greece, Spain and Italy, Hungary does not use the euro single currency, but it is afflicted by similar debt problems. Fears are now growing that Hungary could go bankrupt, prompting it to request help from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. So is Hungary the next step on Europe's path to meltdown? How much does Hungary owe? It is eastern Europe's most indebted nation, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 80%. Despite receiving a $15.8 billion loan by the IMF in 2008, the country is now asking for more. It needs up to $25 billion in loans just to stablilize the struggling forint currency, but this will only go so far. Other countries such as Italy and the UK have similar or higher debt levels, but as Viktor Szabo, former head of market analyis at the National Bank of Hungary, points out, his country is more at risk because its savings are much lower and it is more reliant on foreign investment. What does this mean? The net effect is that Hungary is paying an unsustainable 10% premium over one year to service its debts. If Budapest defaults on its debts, banks in eurozone countries, Austria in particular, whose banks' balance sheets which be hit. This could trigger the ""contagion"" effect which has been so destabilizing to the eurozone countries. Hungary's problems were compounded when its credit rating was junked by the major ratings agencies, meaning its debt is now regarded as high risk and making it more expensive to raise money to refinance existing obligations. Will Hungary get its loans? Not necessarily. The EU says Hungary is failing to cut its budget deficit fast enough, as it has demanded with other countries seeking bailouts. The situation is complicated by the fact that the EU is threatening to take Hungary to the European Court of Justice over that country's new constitution that critics say undermines the independence of key state institutions, rigs the electoral system and curbs press freedoms. Both the EU and IMF say they will refuse to extend aid to Budapest unless the government there guarantees the independence of the central bank. The heads of both those institutions spoke out over fears proposed reforms will give the Hungarian government undue influence over monetary policy. How did this situation come about? Current Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban came to power in April 2010 with a landslide victory that meant his Fidesz party could rule without coalition partners for the first time since the fall of communism. Armed with a comfortable two thirds majority in parliament, the new government set about cutting red tape. But critics say that after less than two years in power, Orban's iron grip over crucial (and supposedly independent) institutions is tightening. The changes to the constitution enacted over the new year have sparked protests in the country amid concerns they will curtail freedom of the press. So will Hungary change course? The Hungarian government has indicated it is ready to meet some of the criticisms of the EU and IMF but critics say it is taking an isolationist position. Former First Deputy Foreign Minister Matyas Eorsi, who helped steer Hungary towards EU accession in 2004, told CNN he believed this approach was doomed. ""You cannot run such a small country in the middle of Europe by claiming an independence war against everybody around you,"" he told CNN. The government has ""declared a freedom fight against international institutions like the IMF,"" said Eorsi, while at home, ""it has systematically dismantled the checks and balances of independent institutions."" With the current set up Hungary risks a ""catastrophe,"" he warned. What will happen next? The government had two strategies, said Szabo: to cut debt and boost growth. ""Neither worked,"" he said. The EC had asked Hungary to cut its debt to GDP ratio by half a percentage point, but it in fact rose by several points. ""The high-risk premium shows a lack of confidence in the markets about Hungary. People are starting to take money out of banks and put it into foreign currency, and open accounts abroad."" There are now two outcomes: Hungary will go bust, said Szabo, or it must ""surrender and accept all conditions of the IMF and the EU."" Former minister Eorsi agreed, and urged PM Orban to either change his domestic policies now or resign. Failing that, he said, the Fidesz party had a duty to oust their leader at the next parliamentary vote.","Hungary requests help from EU, IMF over fears it could go bankrupt .

"(EW.com) -- The latest name thrown in the ring for an ""X Factor"" judges spot: Singer LeAnn Rimes. Sources say Rimes is interested in joining the Fox reality hit, with one source adding that she's met with ""Factor"" co-producer FremantleMedia North America about the gig and other opportunities. ""X Factor"" chief Simon Cowell is seeking to fill the judges panel spots vacated by Paula Abdul and Nicole Scherzinger before the second season starts production later this year. Sources say he'll most likely hire two female talents to join himself and music producer L.A. Reid for a gender-balanced panel. Cowell has not made firm offers for the posts, the list of candidates continue to shift and official outlets continue to decline comment. But Rimes could make sense on a few levels for ""X Factor."" First, she would add country music expertise, like Blake Shelton provides for NBC's ""The Voice."" That could also boost the show's ratings since country music award shows have been one of the few TV genres to have successfully grown their audience in recent years. Rimes also knows what it's like to compete in a TV talent competition, she first gained national attention when she was eight years old by becoming a finalist on Star Search in 1991. Plus, Rimes' personal life, marriage to Eddie Cibrian and weight issues -- while polarizing -- have also drawn plenty of headlines, which would spur press coverage of the show. Rimes performed a tearful tribute at a concert last week to Whitney Houston, who Cowell considered for an ""X Factor"" gig before her death on February 11. Another name recently floating about for the Factor judges panel: ""X Factor"" UK judge Kelly Rowland. The British press have reported yesterday Rowland is quitting the UK series to ""focus on her solo career in the U.S,"" though sources say none of the UK spots have been decided yet. And the former Destiny's Child star recently declared she'd be interested in switching to the U.S. version. ""It would be awesome to be a judge over here for 'X Factor,'"" she told CNN. ""I really enjoyed my time over in the UK being a judge."" Other names circulating for ""X Factor"" posts include singers ranging from Vanessa Hudgens to Britney Spears. Cowell, Fremantle and Fox declined comment, but you can expect more ""X Factor"" judges news later today. Cowell is doing a conference call with reporters in an hour. See the full article at EW.com.

"London (CNN) -- British lawyer Mark Lewis said Thursday he is preparing to take legal action on behalf of three clients who believe their phones were hacked while they were in the United States. One of his clients is a U.S. citizen, he told CNN, but he declined to reveal their identities. Lewis said he would meet with U.S. lawyers face-to-face in New York next week to discuss the cases. Among the other attorneys is Norman Siegel, a former head of the American Civil Liberties Union. Lewis said he had not yet approached News Corp., whose now defunct News of the World newspaper has been accused of hacking the voice mail of crime victims, politicians, celebrities and veterans in search of stories. News International, the British publishing arm of News Corp., declined to comment on the matter. Lewis represents dozens of individuals in the U.K. who say their phones were hacked by Murdoch's newspapers. They include the family of Milly Dowler, a missing teenager whose voice mail was allegedly hacked by News of The World before she was found murdered. Public outrage over the claims led News International to shut down the best-selling Sunday tabloid in July. Allegations also emerged that families of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as relatives of 9/11 victims, had been targeted, and police officers bribed. Police in London are investigating the hacking claims, as well as suspected corruption involving public officials. Last year Lewis told CNN he was ""looking to pursue legal action on the basis of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States, whereby a holding company can be liable for practices outside the jurisdiction where the offense is said to have taken place."" ""Proceedings will be issued in the U.S. where we will seek information from the company's directors about those issues and about corporate governance."" The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, enacted in 1977, makes it illegal for a U.S. citizen or company to pay foreign officials to obtain or retain business. Potential liability flows from journalists at News of the World to its parent, News International, and to that company's parent, News Corp., which is a publicly held company in the United States, and runs Fox News. News Corp. is owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch, who last year answered questions before a British parliamentary committee looking into press conduct. He also made a personal apology to the parents of Milly Dowler, saying the behavior of News of the World had been ""abhorrent.""

"Berlin (CNN) -- Germany's President Christian Wulff announced his resignation Friday following a series of scandals that prompted calls for him to step down. The German presidency is a largely ceremonial office, but Wulff's resignation is seen as a blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel, who supported his candidacy as president. However, it is unlikely to impact Germany's handling of the eurozone debt crisis, Carsten Brzeski, a senior economist at ING, told CNN. In a brief televised statement, Merkel said she accepted Wulff's resignation with the ""utmost respect and deepest personal regret."" Wulff had put the interests of the general public to the fore in deciding to resign, Merkel said. In a separate televised statement, Wulff said Germany ""needs a president who can devote himself completely to national and international challenges"" -- and one who commands the trust of a wide majority of citizens. ""The developments of the past days and weeks have shown that this trust and therefore confidence in my ability to serve have been adversely affected,"" he said. ""For this reason, it is no longer possible for me to continue in my role as president."" The scandal involves alleged political favors and financial impropriety while he was state premier of Lower Saxony. The Hanover prosecutor's office called Thursday for the government to waive the president's immunity from prosecution, in light of the evidence it had gathered. ""Following extensive analyses of new documents and the evaluation of further media reports, the Hanover Public Prosecutor's Office now has sufficient factual evidence and therefore grounds for initial suspicion of receiving bribes or being granted advantages,"" it said in a statement. ""(The Office) therefore proposes to the president of the German Parliament that immunity for the federal president be waived."" The Hanover prosecutors are investigating David Groenewold, a German film producer, alongside Wulff. At the center of the issue is a story -- first reported on by the German tabloid BILD in mid-December last year -- that Wulff received a low interest, â‚¬500,000 ($649,000) private loan from the wife of a wealthy friend while still governor of Lower Saxony. This was followed by intense criticism when it emerged that Wulff had attempted to prevent the paper from publishing the story. Trying to put a lid on any negative media coverage, Wulff left an angry message on the answering machine of BILD's editor-in-chief Kai Diekmann before it reported on the loan. Although Wulff eventually apologized to Diekmann, the former president has always maintained that he did nothing wrong throughout the course of the scandals -- something he reiterated during his resignation speech. ""I have always behaved legally correctly in the offices I held,"" he said. ""I have made mistakes, but I was always honest."" Merkel said Wulff's presidency would be remembered for his efforts to promote a modern, tolerant Germany. She added: ""With his resignation, President Wulff reiterated his conviction that he always behaved legally correctly in office and in service to the people of our country. I express my utmost respect for this position."" The members of her governing coalition would now discuss who should stand for election in his place, she said, in consultation with other political parties. Merkel had been due to meet Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti in Rome to discuss the eurozone crisis but canceled the trip amid the political storm over Wulff, who belongs to her party. However, Brzeski said that Wulff's resignation should not have any direct impact on Germany's handling of the eurozone crisis in the short term, given his almost entirely ceremonial role. ""Even if it is the highest official office in Germany, he has no say at all in the government's policy toward the crisis,"" Brzeski said. However, in the medium term the Wulff affair could weaken Merkel's position in domestic politics, he said, which could affect her ability to win parliamentary votes on the eurozone's bailout fund, the EFSF, and a second bailout package for Greece. Merkel has not had involvement in any of the scandals. But Wulff's departure comes within two years of the resignation of his predecessor, Horst Koehler, who was also backed by Merkel -- raises a question mark over her judgment, Brzeski added. Merkel's decision to liaise with the Social Democrats and the Greens on finding a replacement for Wulff is a break from her earlier stance in 2010, when she insisted on Wulff as successor to Koehler, who resigned following controversial comments in which he suggested military deployments were vital to Germany's economic success. The chairman of the Social Democrats (SPD), Sigmar Gabriel, said Wulff's decision had been long overdue. ""Germany needs a new beginning,"" he said. ""I'm assuming that the leaders of the CDU and Federal Chancellor Merkel won't for the third time be selecting a new candidate with purely partisan motives. They have to include all political parties in their discussions to find a consensus candidate."" The Greens' parliamentary leaders, Renate KÃ¼nast and JÃ¼rgen Trittin, said they were ""relieved that Christian Wulff has finally unburdened the country from agonizing debate with his resignation."" Wulff, who was the state premier of Lower Saxony for seven years, was one of Merkel's biggest rivals within the Christian Democrats before being elected to the presidency in 2010. It took three rounds of voting in the Bundestag, or German parliament, before he won enough backing from lawmakers to assume the role. German presidents are elected by the Federal Convention, comprised of parliament members. Wulff was born in Osnabruck, Lower Saxony, in June 1959 and went on to become a lawyer, according to the official website of the presidency. He first entered local politics as a member of the CDU party in 1986 and was elected to Lower Saxony's parliament in 1994. He was chosen as state premiere by lawmakers in his party following elections in 2003. He was the 10th president to serve in the Federal Republic of Germany. He has been married twice and has two children of his own and a stepson. CNN's Christopher Cottrell, Laura Smith-Spark and Kendra Wates contributed to this report.","NEW: The resignation will not affect Germany's handling of the eurozone debt crisis - analyst .

"New York (CNN) -- Longtime local news anchor Sue Simmons will no longer fill her familiar co-anchor chair at New York's NBC station, according to a company statement. Simmons, 68, who has spent more than three decades on-air for WNBC and was reportedly at one time the highest paid local television anchor in the country, will not get her contract renewed when it expires in June. ""We have tremendous respect and admiration for Sue Simmons,"" said Dawn Rowan, a spokesperson for the station. ""For decades, Sue has been a critical part of New York's longest tenured anchor team in the city and has more than earned her iconic status."" The announcement of her departure spawned a ""Save Sue Simmons"" Facebook page, and prompted other social media postings about her past exploits. Her anchoring is punctuated by what some called a quintessential New York attitude, and her often sassy comments, smirks and grins go against what might be considered typical news anchor decor. Jack Cafferty, a CNN commentator who co-anchored with Simmons for 13 of the 32 years she has worked for WNBC, called her a ""breath of fresh air in the otherwise stuffy, pretentious world of journalism."" Mark Harris, a columnist for Entertainment Weekly, tweeted: ""Fellow New Yorkers, I hope you all get that this is wrong, stupid and evil,"" Her newscast was ranked No. 1 in the fiercely competitive New York local news market this year among advertisers' favorite demographic, ages 25 to 54. Simmons did not immediately return calls seeking comment. The contract of her co-anchor, Chuck Scarborough, 68, has been renewed for another three years. Simmons' role had been diminished in recent years, anchoring only the station's 11 p.m. newscast. The show dropped her from the 6 p.m. slot last year after she returned from back surgery. She will remain on the air until her contract expires, the station said.","WNBC has ended its 32-year relationship with Sue Simmons .

"(CNN) -- More than two dozen Chinese construction workers abducted in Sudan have been released, the International Committee of the Red Cross said Tuesday. The 29 workers flew out of Sudan aboard a Red Cross plane bound for Nairobi, Kenya, a statement from the ICRC said. Rebels kidnapped the workers January 28 from a camp run by China's Power Construction Corp. in volatile South Kordofan. Eighteen other workers in the camp escaped the raid, which the Sudanese military blamed on the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North -- a rebel force in the border region with neighboring South Sudan. One worker died in the raid, according to Xinhua, China's official news agency. Sudanese authorities handed over the worker's body Tuesday, Xinhua said. The workers were released after what Xinhua described as ""a stream of intensive rescue efforts carried out by the Chinese government in collaboration with the Sudanese government and other parties."" The Al-Adhdath daily newspaper in Khartoum earlier said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had mediated for the release. South Sudan became the world's newest nation last year after decades of conflict with the north. Nevertheless, violence in South Kordofan and the nearby Blue Nile states has forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes. While the region is in Sudanese territory, it straddles Sudan and South Sudan's ethnic and political lines. China is Sudan's largest trading partner, while Sudan is China's third-largest trading partner in Africa. According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, trade between the two countries reached $8.63 billion in 2010, an increase of 35.1% compared with the previous year. The close bilateral cooperation is mainly driven by oil exports from Sudan, which is among the top oil suppliers for China.","Chinese hostages are freed in Sudan; they're now on the way to Kenya .

"(CNN) -- Liverpool dumped Manchester United out of the English FA Cup with a dramatic late winner from Dirk Kuyt at Anfield on Saturday. In their first meeting since the Luis Suarez/Patrice Evra race row erupted in October last year, it was Liverpool who gained the early advantage as Daniel Agger headed home from a corner in the 21st minute. But United, who dominated possession in the first half, were back on level terms before the break as Park Ji-sung fired low past Jose Reina in the 39th minute. A scrappy second half ensued with neither side looking likely to score before Kuyt latched on to a flick from Andy Carroll to drill home an 88th-minute winner in front of a delirious Kop. The result capped a fine week for the Merseyside club as they eliminated both the blue and red sides of Manchester from English football's domestic cup competitions. Chelsea kept their hopes of winning a seventh FA Cup alive with a 1-0 win at local rivals Queens Park Rangers -- a Juan Mata penalty in the 62nd minute proving decisive. In the other all-Premier League ties, Bolton Wanderers came from behind to beat Swansea City 2-1 at the Reebok Stadium. Luke Moore put the visitors ahead in the 43rd minute only to see former Swansea player Darren Pratley equalize moments later. Bolton's winner came from Chris Eagles 10 minutes into the second period. West Bromwich Albion couldn't make the most of home advantage though, losing 2-1 to Norwich City. Grant Holt put the Canaries in front in the 34th minute with Marc Antoine-Fortune equalizing early on in the second half. But Simeon Jackson made sure of Norwich having their name in the fifth round draw with a goal five minutes from the end. Newcastle United won't be in the draw for the next round as they were beaten 1-0 by Championship side Brighton -- a Mike Williamson own goal in the 76th minute sending Gus Poyet's team through.

"Washington (CNN) -- A number of websites including TMZ and YouTube posted a video Wednesday showing four men dressed in U.S. Marine Corps combat gear urinating on the apparently dead bodies of three men sprawled on the ground in front of them. One of the men says, ""Have a great day, buddy."" A voice asks, ""You got it on the video?"" to which another voice responds, ""Yeah."" Another jokes, ""Golden, like a shower."" It was not clear who shot or posted the 39-second video, who the people pictured in it were, or where it was shot. A senior Marine Corps official who has examined the video said the Marines are carrying 30-caliber sniper rifles and wearing helmets issued to members of Marine Corps sniper teams. The helmets are designed with a shorter front and sides so that snipers can place rifles and scopes near their faces. The official, who said an investigating officer was expected to be named shortly, added that the desecration of a body by U.S. troops could be considered a potential war crime. ""We recently became aware of an inappropriate video on a public website that appears to involve members of our military,"" International Security Assistance Force spokesman Col. Gary Kolb said from Kabul, Afghanistan. ""We will not speculate on the details but will take all necessary actions to determine the facts."" He said an investigation was under way but would not comment on the video's authenticity. The faces of the bodies are not identifiable. ""While we have not yet verified the origin or authenticity of this video, the actions portrayed are not consistent with our core values and are not indicative of the character of the Marines in our Corps,"" said U.S.M.C.

We are in the process of verifying what unit these Marines are with right now and as soon as we have more information, we will let you know."" ""Regardless of the circumstances or who is in the video, this is egregious, disgusting behavior,"" said Department of Defense spokesman Capt. John Kirby. ""It's hideous. It turned my stomach."" In a statement, the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the video. ""If verified as authentic, the video shows behavior that is totally unbecoming of American military personnel and that could ultimately endanger other soldiers and civilians,"" wrote CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad in a letter to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.

"(CNN) -- A series of viral outbreaks causing diarrhea and vomiting has affected scores of people in North Carolina in recent weeks, sickening them, but causing no fatalities, health officials there said Wednesday. Several health departments have reported multiple outbreaks, prompting officials to urge residents to take precautions to prevent possible exposure to the virus, which they identified as norovirus. The largest outbreak, with 135 cases traced to a single restaurant, was found in Catawba County, said Kelly Schermerhorn, a public information officer with the Catawba County Public Health Department. She said the cases were linked to the Harbor Inn Seafood Diner in Conover. The restaurant is about an hour northwest of Charlotte. Most of the complaints were from people who had eaten at the restaurant on January 13 or January 14 and became ill 12 to 24 hours after dining there, said the health department in a posting on its website. Health officials are calling about 100 Harbor Inn patrons in a case-control study to find out what they ate and how they may have become sick. ""We are not sure yet how it started,"" Harbor Inn Seafood Manager George Ciogas told CNN in a telephone interview. Following the initial report of illness, Catawba County Public Health's Environmental Health specialists said they conducted a thorough inspection of the restaurant and found no violations. ""There does not appear to be any concern about ongoing exposure to norovirus at Harbor Inn,"" said Doug Urland, health director of Catawba County Public Health Department, in a statement. ""A case-control study will give us and state health officials the ability to learn more about the nature of norovirus, how it spreads, and what steps may be available to help better prevent this type of illness in the future."" But health officials acknowledge they may never be able to track down the cause. ""The most important message we have right now is that people who are ill with vomiting or diarrhea should not work, go to school or attend day care while they are having symptoms,"" said Dr. Megan Davies, the state epidemiologist. ""Everyone needs to wash their hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water. This is the most effective way to protect yourself and others against norovirus, since hand sanitizers alone are not as effective against this hardy virus."" Common symptoms of norovirus infection include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some victims may have fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and a general sense of tiredness, it says on its website. The CDC estimates that more than 20 million cases of acute gastroenteritis are caused by noroviruses in the United States each year.","At least 135 people sickened in one outbreak linked to a restaurant .

"(CNN) -- An estimated 111 million U.S. viewers are expected to tune in Sunday for Super Bowl XLVI. It features the scrappy New York Giants against the New England Patriots, who are looking for their fourth NFL title. Kickoff in Indianapolis is 6:30 p.m. ET. Before you get too comfortable in that favorite chair, here's our list of five things to watch: . Each other: Americans are in the mood to live it up a little more this year, with the average game-watcher spending $63.87 on Super Bowl merchandise, snacks and apparel, up from $59.33 last year, according to a survey by the Retail Advertising and Marketing Association. Of those watching the Giants-Patriots, nearly 27.1% are planning to attend a party, according to the association, and another 15.3% plan to throw a party. Looking for some last-minute snack ideas? Richard Blais, Eva Longoria and others provide dip options at CNN's Eatocracy blog. But watch the double-dipping. ""After double-dipping just a few times, researchers found 50 to 100 times more bacteria in the dip -- and that was just from one mouth,"" says Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. Yuck. The commercials: Bueller? Bueller? Bueller? By now you've probably seen the Matthew Broderick update of his hijinks from 1986's cult classic ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" This time he's toned it down a notch from a Ferrari to a more practical, family-friendly Honda CR-V. Ad watchers are calling 2012 the year of the celebrity, with the likes of David Beckham, Danica Patrick and Jerry Seinfeld shilling products. Many ads have appeared before the game. Volkswagen just can't get enough of ""Star Wars."" For its pre-game teaser commercial, the company traded last year's Darth Vader kid for a black dog with a circuit board on its chest. In fact, the teaser features a whole pack of dogs. Remember the ""Imperial March""? Of course you do. But not like this. One survey shows about 55% of U.S. adults who plan to tune in Sunday are watching as much or more for the ads as the action on the gridiron. The Hanon McKendry poll shows the number for women in that category is 66%, compared to 46% for the guys. Watch 2012 Super Bowl ad mash-up . Halftime: The Material Girl told reporters this week she ""was maintaining her sanity"" while working hard to be ready. Madonna's 12-minute set will include a new song and three previous hits. Joining her will be MIA and Nicki Minaj. Madonna promises there will be no ""wardrobe malfunction,"" a reference to the 2004 Super Bowl, at which pop singer Janet Jackson's breast was briefly exposed during a live halftime show with fellow entertainer Justin Timberlake. Your cell phone? Apparently, a good many people aren't occupied enough by the annual super extravaganza called the Super Bowl. Nearly 60% of mobile phone users plan to look at their device during the game, according to a survey by Velti, a mobile marketing firm. Oh yeah, the game: There will be a football game sandwiched in, and it's expected to be a pretty good one. The Giants bring quarterback Eli Manning and a tough defense to Indianapolis, determined to keep Pats QB Tom Brady from taking home a fourth Super Bowl championship ring. Game time, 6:30 p.m. Eastern, NBC, at Lucas Oil Stadium. A few story lines: Can Patriots superstar tight end Rob Gronkowski overcome a hobbled ankle? Giants rookie linebacker Mark Herzlich survived a bone cancer diagnosis two years ago. And Zoltan Mesko, the Pats' punter, has come a long way from growing up in Romania, where in the late 1980s his family dodged bullets during revolutions that eventually toppled the communist regime. And, if five tips is not enough, here is a bonus: . Counterprogramming: Every year, a few brave souls go to a second location in the house or just stay home to watch anything OTHER than the Super Bowl. This year's options include PBS' ""Downton Abbey, where football would come in the shape of a soccer ball. For the romantics, there's ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" on AMC and ""Wedding Date"" and ""Hitch"" on TBS.

"Miami (CNN) -- Iran will not be able to use alliances with Latin America to wield significant influence on security in the West, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday. ""We have the full capacity to make sure that does not happen,"" Biden told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited four Latin American countries in a five-day tour earlier this year, searching for support there amid growing global sanctions targeting his nation's nuclear program. At a hearing last month, the chairwoman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee said she was deeply concerned about Iran's ties with leaders like Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. ""These alliances can pose an immediate threat by giving Iran -- directly through the IRGC, the Qods Force, or its proxies like Hezbollah -- a platform in the region to carry out attacks against the United States, our interests, and allies,"" said U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida. But Biden said Wednesday that such fears were overblown. ""People talk about Hezbollah. They talk about Iranian support for weapons and the rest. I guarantee you, Iran will not be able to pose a hemispheric threat to the United States,"" he said. Speaking to CNN en EspaÃ±ol in Miami, Biden said his two-day trip to Mexico and Honduras this week was a success. ""It was mostly about violence and what can be done to deal with the violence,"" Biden said. Mexican President Felipe Calderon asked for additional assistance vetting local police officers, Biden said. Central American leaders requested similar aid. Latin American leaders have repeatedly argued that drug use in the United States fuels escalating violence throughout the region. On Tuesday, Biden told reporters the United States ""shared responsibility,"" but also noted that Central American countries must work to stop drug production. He told CNN en EspaÃ±ol Wednesday that the leaders he met with said they were grateful for U.S. assistance. ""This was not one of those accusation sessions,"" he said. CNN's Juan Carlos Lopez contributed to this report.","Biden says the U.S. has ""capacity"" to stop Iran from influencing Western security .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer remained on course for a semifinal showdown at the Australian Open with untroubled passage to the third round on Wednesday, but top American hope Mardy Fish became the first high-profile casualty of the men's draw. Second seed Nadal won in straight sets for the second match in a row, beating former world No. 2 Tommy Haas, while Federer had a walkover against another German, Andreas Beck. Nadal showed no signs of the recurring knee problem that troubled him before Monday's opening win as he triumphed 6-4 6-3 6-4 against the oldest player in the singles draw. The 33-year-old Haas has reached the semifinals three times in Melbourne, but has fallen to 190th in the rankings after a series of injury problems. ""I really practiced well,"" said Nadal, who next faces Slovakia's world No. 119 Lukas Lacko -- a four-set conqueror of American Donald Young. ""I had very good preparation. I won already two matches in straight sets with positive feeling. I am well."" Federer, seeking his fifth title in the season's opening grand slam and his 17th overall, will face big-serving Croatian Ivo Karlovic in the last 32 following Beck's pre-match withdrawal with a back injury. The Swiss third seed, whose last major title came in Australia in 2010, had been due to play away from the main Rod Laver Arena court for the first time in 52 matches. But he said he was pleased that women players were getting more of a chance to play in marquee night matches this year, which means fewer late finishes for the men. ""I don't think it's good that they always had the women's match first. I think it's good to mix it up,"" the 30-year-old said. Eighth seed Fish was less happy to play in the scorching afternoon heat, complaining about the timeouts that Colombian opponent Alejandro Falla took for treating cramps before sealing a 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 7-6 (8-6) victory. ""I thought he was having some physical issues. But then in between, on every point, he was totally fine,"" Fish said. ""I have a hard time calling the trainer for anything. I wouldn't want the other guy to know that I was hurting in the first place. To be able to get help for lack of fitness ... I mean, if you saw how much water I drank in the past three days just to hydrate to make sure that something like that didn't happen -- I did all the right things there."" Falla, ranked 71st, will next play Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber, with the winner of that match likely to take on Argentine 11th seed Juan Martin del Potro. The 2009 U.S. Open champion set up a third-round clash with Taiwan's world No. 79 Yen-Hsun Lu by beating Slovenia's Blaz Kavcic 6-4 7-5 6-3, continuing his career revival following longterm wrist injury. Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych went through after beating Belgium's Olivier Rochus in straight sets, and will next play big-serving South African No. 30 Kevin Anderson. American 16th seed John Isner survived another marathon match as he defeated 2006 semifinalist David Nalbandian 4-6 6-3 2-6 7-6 (7-5) 10-8. The match lasted more than four and a half hours, and the deciding set went for 99 minutes -- with Nalbandian furious that he was denied a video challenge at 8-8 when he held a break-point on Isner's serve. ""Obviously the ump didn't think he challenged in time, but maybe because of the crowd noise the ump couldn't hear it or what not,"" Isner said. ""The break went in my favour, for sure."" Isner, who was involved in the longest match in tennis history at Wimbledon in 2010, won the game and then broke the Argentine's serve in the next to set up a clash with Spanish 18th seed Feliciano Lopez. His fellow American Sam Querrey lost to Australia's 19-year-old rising star Bernard Tomic, who will next face Ukrainian 13th seed Alexandr Dolgopolov. Spanish 10th seed Nicolas Almagro came from 2-1 down to beat Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov in five sets to book a tie with Swiss 21st seed Stanislas Wawrinka, who beat 2006 finalist Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus, 7-6 6-4 5-7 6-1.","World No. 2 Rafael Nadal reaches third round in Melbourne, beating Tommy Haas .

"(CNN) -- Taking a cue from Twitter, Facebook will be rolling out ""verified accounts"" for its most popular users -- presumably hoping to encourage the Lady Gagas of the world to get active on the site. Starting Thursday, the site began testing a system that lets people with a large number of subscribers submit a government ID to prove they really are who they say they are. ""This update makes it even easier for subscribers to find and keep up with journalists, celebrities and other public figures they want to connect to,"" a Facebook spokesman said in an e-mail. Once verified, a user will be able to ""more prominently display an alternate name (nickname, maiden name, byline, etc.) on their timelines in addition to their real name."" Unlike Twitter, Facebook has required users to register under their real names. So, now presumably Stefani Germanotta can be Lady Gaga on Facebook, Declan McManus can be Elvis Costello, and Madonna Louise Ciccone can share photos of her Super Bowl performance using just her first name. Twitter, which lets folks create an account using any handle they want, has long had ""verified"" accounts for public figures to distinguish the real people and their tweets from the impersonators. While at one point users could request one, the site now makes its own decisions about who gets the coveted check-mark. The nickname issue has been a thorny one for social-networking sites like Facebook that stake their brand (and target their advertising) based on people using their real identities. Last month, Google's upstart networking site, Google+, settled the issue with a compromise similar to Facebook's -- allowing people to display a nickname or other pseudonym alongside their real name. In the early going, Google+ had taken flak from early adopters, some of whom were booted for signing up with names that were not real. Many of those people argued they were more widely known by nicknames on the Web. Celebrities, sports stars, journalists and the like who have been verified by Facebook will now get more prominent display on the site's ""People To Subscribe To"" list. Facebook has been allowing subscriptions for about five months. They let users share information with anyone who chooses to subscribe to their feeds without having to actually become Facebook friends with them.","Facebook is rolling out ""verified accounts"" on Thursday .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's probation should end next month, clearing the way for the actress to revive her acting career possibly playing Elizabeth Taylor in a made-for-TV movie. ""Ms. Lohan, you're in the homestretch,"" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner told the actress during a probation progress hearing Wednesday. February is the third straight month of positive reports for Lohan, and a major change from recent years in which she was found in violation of probation for failed drug and alcohol tests, missed counseling sessions and community service work and a shoplifting arrest. ""You seem to be getting your life back on track and that what we hoped for,"" Judge Sautner said. ""It's never our goal to put people in jail."" Lohan has 14 more days of community service -- cleaning up at the county morgue -- and five more counseling sessions to complete before her next progress hearing on March 29. After that, her probation for two drunk driving convictions five years ago will end. The probation for last year's necklace theft conviction continues, but Judge Sautner said it becomes informal summary probation with no reporting requirements. ""All you have to do is obey all laws, stay out of trouble and get on with your life,"" the judge told Lohan. Lohan has been in court more than a dozen times in the last two years, each time creating a media frenzy inside and outside the courthouse. But far fewer reporters attended Wednesday's hearing. ""They just don't want to cover good news,"" Lohan lawyer Shawn Holley said. Stints in jail and court-ordered rehab cost Lohan acting jobs in recent years, but with the light at the end of the strict probation tunnel in sight, the acting jobs are reappearing. Lohan travels to New York next week to host NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" on March 3. It's her fourth time hosting the show, but the first since her legal troubles began in 2007. She appears close to signing a deal to play the lead in a Lifetime network movie about legendary actress Elizabeth Taylor, who died last year. Her publicist acknowledged negotiations are underway, but ""nothing has been signed."" Although just 25, Lohan has deep knowledge of Hollywood's golden age and has a ""high regard"" for its icons, he said. She would ""really embrace"" the role of Taylor, Steve Honig said. The sales success of her nude photo spread in Playboy magazine, which hit news stands in December, is evidence that Lohan's star power survived her legal troubles. Lohan was reportedly paid nearly $1 million to pose for the photos taken in a style reminiscent of the nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe that graced the debut issue of Playboy in 1953.","""You seem to be getting your life back on track,"" judge tells Lohan .

"Dallas (CNN) -- The far-reaching investigation into a ""bounty"" scandal is reverberating across the National Football League and threatens to tarnish the loveable image of the New Orleans Saints franchise. ""It's going to be a huge scandal,"" senior Sports Illustrated writer Peter King told CNN. ""This will give the NFL a chance to come down on something that's sort of been a whisper campaign and a shadow story for a long time."" The NFL said as many as 27 players were paid up to $1,500 for vicious hits that would knock opposing players out of the game or force them to be carried off the football field. According to the NFL, players paid into a ""bounty"" fund, that reached as high as $50,000 and Saints' defensive coordinator Gregg Williams would dole out the payments based on game performance. On Monday, NFL security officials continued interviewing coaches and players across the league. According to NFL.com, league security officials met with Williams, who now works as the defensive coordinator for the St. Louis Rams. Williams admits carrying out the cash-for-performance scheme. ""It was a terrible mistake,"" Williams said in a statement to the Times-Picayune newspaper in New Orleans. ""And we knew it was wrong while we were doing it. Instead of getting caught up in it, I should have stopped it."" Many former players say ""bounty"" incentive programs have existed in professional football for a long time. Players, who question why this scandal is shocking so many fans, say football is a violent sport built around punishing your opponent. LaVar Arrington, a former Washington Redskins linebacker, now writes the ""Hard Hits"" blog for the Washington Post. Arrington said the best players in the history of football have always brought a ""seek and destroy mentality"" to the game. ""So in a culture where it's an unwritten part of the game to get the best opposing player out of it, that's what players have done and still do to this day. The fact that there's such outrage appears to be a bit strange to me,"" Arrington wrote on his blog Monday. The NFL said the ""bounty"" program is a clear violation of rules intended to protect ""player safety and competitive integrity."" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell hasn't announced what kind of disciplinary action the league will take, but it's clear the punishment could include ""fines and suspensions."" The NFL said that in addition to Williams, sanctions could be brought against New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton. Peter King: Goodell to make an example of Saints . The NFL statement said Payton was not a direct participant but ""failed to stop the bounty program"" after he was made aware of the allegations. Saints' general manager Micky Loomis could face harsh punishment as well. The league statement said Loomis was told by Saints owner Tom Benson to end the program and never followed through. Loomis also ""denied any knowledge of a bounty program"" according to the league statement. The ""bounty"" program investigation is also growing beyond the Saints' organization. The Washington Post reported the NFL is also investigating the Washington Redskins. Williams coached with the Redskins during 2004-2007 seasons. And Coy Wire, who played for Williams during his stint with the Buffalo Bills, told CNN he was interviewed by NFL security officials on Monday and questioned about ""performance incentive"" programs. Wire said Williams was one of the best coaches he's ever played for but got carried away and let the Saints' ""bounty"" program go too far. Wire is now a motivational speaker and worries about how this scandal will influence young kids learning to play football. ""You want an edge mentally. You want to break your opponent's will to win. In football the best way to break their will is to break their body,"" Wire said. ""We really have to figure out where to draw the line and what kind of rules and regulations need to be drawn up to make sure that nothing goes too far anymore so that we can make a safer game for future players.""","NFL: As many as 27 players took part in the ""bounty"" program .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- An Indian freelance journalist working for an Iranian news outlet has been arrested in connection with the bombing of an Israeli embassy car in New Delhi last month, authorities said Wednesday. The suspect has been identified as Syed Mohammad Kazmi and is being held on charges of plotting the attack, according to Ashok Chand, deputy commissioner of police. A court remanded Kazmi, 50, in police custody for questioning, Chand told CNN. Authorities did not say which Iranian media organization Kazmi allegedly worked for. The device attached to the Israeli vehicle wounded several people when it exploded. The same day, another device was found on an Israeli Embassy car in Tbilisi, Georgia, and safety detonated. A day later, a series of bombs went off in Bangkok, Thailand.

"(Ars Technica) -- These days, it seems, it's not enough for a digital device to just play games. To keep up with the smartphones and tablet computers of the world, any game system needs to at least nod in the direction of cloud-based and social networking ""apps"" that are all the rage with the kiddies. Sony's PlayStation Vita has now done exactly that, launching free downloadable Netflix, Twitter and Flickr apps in conjunction with the system's official debut Wednesday (though pre-orderers have had the system for a week now). Your very first encounter with two of these apps foreshadows the occasionally awkward experience to come. When you first load up Twitter or Flickr on your Vita, you're asked to click a button that opens up a web browser where you can log in to the service. Then you're expected to write down a confirmation code and navigate back to the original app to confirm your credentials. It's a minor, one-time annoyance, but it makes the Netflix app's integrated login prompt seem futuristic by comparison. CNN Tech: Hands-on with the new PlayStation Vita . Netflix . Netflix is probably the most useful of the apps in the Vita's initial batch. Even if you already have the streaming video service on a host of other devices (and you probably do), the Vita's large, crisp screen provides a pleasant portable viewing experience without being quite as large or cumbersome as an iPad or laptop (not to mention an HDTV). The Vita's 960 x 544 resolution isn't quite ""HD,"" but high-definition content still looks pretty good, provided you have the bandwidth to view it (warning to 3G users: Netflix will eat up your data allowance incredibly quickly). This is the only Vita app so far that makes use of the system's face buttons as well as the touch screen, letting you fast forward and rewind with the analog stick or pause with the X button. You can also use the touch screen to flick through a timeline of screengrabs from the video, which is quite pleasant. My only real complaint about the interface is the odd inability to scroll through the front page of recommendations with quick flicks -- instead you have to awkwardly tap on-screen buttons to move up and down the rows. Twitter . The Vita's Twitter app, dubbed LiveTweet, provides all the basic functionality you'd expect from the service and then some. It's easy to scroll through your timeline, @replies or direct messages with responsive flick scrolling and a familiar pull-down-to-refresh option. You can easily search through tweets by keyword or hashtag and even view a series of @replies through a handy conversation view. Writing tweets is relatively painless using the Vita's big on-screen keyboard, though I found myself often missing the space bar when I was typing quickly. But LiveTweet is somewhat annoying to use if you, like me, primarily use Twitter as a way to scan for interesting links posted by interesting friends. Clicking a link from LiveTweet loads up the Vita's somewhat limited web browser, which takes a few seconds to warm up and then load the page. Once you come back to LiveTweet, the app has often lost your place in browsing the tweetstream, which means you have to wait a few seconds for everything to load again and then waste time scrolling to find your place. It's also hard to imagine where Twitter for the Vita is going to find its niche. If you're on the computer, you likely have a better Twitter app just a click away. If you're away from the computer, you're more likely to have a Twitter-capable smartphone that's handier to carry around than the massive Vita, which easily dominates any pocket it fits in. Still, if you need to tell the world about your Super Stardust Delta high score right now, you're only a few taps away from doing so on the Vita. Flickr . Flickr rounds out the Vita's initial round of apps, with quite possibly the nicest interface of the bunch. Rows of easy-to-scroll-through thumbnail images provide quick access to you photostream, favorites, contacts, saved searches and even suggestions for interesting Flickr members to browse through. There's also a nice batch upload option that doesn't even require leaving the main menu, though why you'd want to upload many photos from the Vita's low-quality camera is a mystery (the service might be more useful for uploading screenshots, though, which I did while composing writing this very piece). It only takes a couple of taps to go from a tiny thumbnail to a beautiful, full-screen image that you can easily pan and zoom around with the multitouch screen. It is somewhat annoying, though, that you can only view caption and tag information when the image is an unzoomed, compact square on the right side of the screen -- some sort of transparent overlay option would have been nice. It's also a bit odd that there's no option to download photos to your Vita to use as home screen wallpapers, though you can use the Vita's screenshot function to approximate this feature. So far, the Vita's nongaming apps feel more like nice extras than crucial selling points for the system. They work better as a proof-of-concept for the potential nongaming uses of the Vita's excellent touchscreen than as tools you're likely to fully integrate into your digital life. Here's hoping Sony relaxes its tight hold on the PlayStation Network marketplace to let more app makers play around with the system's potential outside of games.

"(CNN) -- For many Americans, summer vacation is over and the kids are headed back to school. The temperatures are still sweltering in much of the country and many of us could use a good book to escape these dog days. Whether you're firing up the e-reader or headed to your local library, here are a few ideas on some hot reads, from the supernatural to surfing, plus a pair of top shelf puzzlers. If you're tired of the ""Twilight"" saga, and have seen every episode of ""True Blood,"" then sink your teeth into Glen Duncan's ""The Last Werewolf."" Readers are devouring this elegantly written and darkly humorous tale. Critics are universal in their praise, calling it howling good. In the book, Jake Marlowe is the last of his kind, a charming but lonely lycanthrope who's fond of single-malt scotch, camel cigarettes and expensive prostitutes. When the moon becomes full, Jake transforms into a bloodthirsty beast, who craves human flesh. Now 200 years old, haunted by his past and tired of battling werewolf hunters and vampires, Jake is ready to turn himself in to his enemies and end his life but author, Duncan throws in a twist that changes Jake's resolve and will keep readers absorbed to the very end. This a blood spattered page turner, full of violence and sex, not for the squeamish but a thrilling read nonetheless. Hollywood agrees, Oscar-nominated director, Ridley Scott has optioned the film rights and Duncan is already working on a sequel. Check out a video trailer for ""The Last Werewolf."" If you didn't make it to the beach in person this year, Don Winslow's ""The Gentlemen's Hour"" may be the next best thing. Winslow is an award winning veteran of the summertime crime novel. He captivated readers and critics with his best-seller, ""Savages"" last year, which is being turned into a big-budget movie by Oscar-winning director, Oliver Stone. Now Winslow's out with a sequel to 2009's ""The Dawn Patrol,"" featuring the return of Boone Daniels, a former cop turned private investigator, who would rather surf than work. This time out, Daniels is investigating the death of a local surfing hero, but he'll have to face down some Mexican gang bangers, neo-Nazis and a reclusive billionaire before he can get to the truth. Winslow is a former P.I. and his prose drips with authentic detail, capturing the seedy side of the San Diego surfing scene as well as the beauty of sundown on the southern California coast.

"Washington (CNN) -- Dressed in yellow full-body sanitation suits, members of the U.S. Park Police combed through tents in the Occupy DC camp Saturday, taking down ones violating park policies. The owners of the tossed tents and other protesters were agitated by the move, but there was little unrest at McPherson Square in downtown Washington. Park police in riot gear first entered at dawn Saturday, and said they were not there to evict protesters, but to check for compliance with ""no camping"" laws. Still, at one point, there was a confrontation between protesters and riot police. The move comes after a federal judge Tuesday rejected an Occupy DC demonstrator's request to keep park police from enforcing a ban on camping in McPherson park and nearby Freedom Plaza. Living in a public park as a means of protest is not protected by the First Amendment, Judge James Boasberg ruled. The operation was a success and a majority of those in the park cooperated with police, park police spokesman David Schlosser said. Eight people were arrested in the confrontation with police, he said. Four for failure to obey a lawful order, and three for crossing a police line. Another person was arrested for felony assault on an officer and assault with a deadly weapon after Schlosser said the man threw a brick at one of the officers. The officer was treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries, Schlosser said. ""The United States Park Police continue to support the right of people to exercise their constitutionally protected rights,"" he said. Protesters heckled him as he briefed reporters early Saturday. As he spoke, the officer was interrupted by someone who made a rooster sound, and others made ghost-like noises in the background. ""In some of the tents we found urine-soaked bedding materials, bottles of urine,"" noted Schlosser. ""In some of the tents we found some dead rats. We also found some live rats, with some rat families."" Authorities told protesters Monday that they had to remove camping gear such as sleeping bags and housekeeping materials, but could keep their tents as long as one flap remains open at all times. On Saturday, police began removing the tents from the park that had camping gear inside. Protesters complained and accused the officers of taking down tents that were not in violation. At the outset of their search, police found only one compliant tent, and took down there rest. Once the inspection is complete, the park will be reopened to the public, Schlosser said. Occupy DC is part of a larger activist movement that began last year in New York and quickly spread across the country. While the protesters have highlighted a number of causes, the overarching theme has remained largely the same: populist anger over what activists portray as an out-of-touch corporate, financial and political elite. CNN's Jonathan Helman, Greg Clary and Courtney Battle contributed to this report.","NEW: Eight people have been arrested, including one for felony assault .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- New technology devised by a Connecticut firm, The Green Revolution Inc is turning sessions at the gym into clean renewable electricity. The Green Revolution device snaps on to the front of all major brands of indoor cycling equipment. It's a workout that hopes to work out some of our energy problems and offers a glimpse of what could be achieved if we all do our bit for the environment. The first devices were recently installed on seventeen bicycles at the Ridgefield Fitness Club in Ridgefield, Connecticut. The energy generated is fed straight into the club's electricity control cabinet where a grid-tie inverter pumps energy back on to the grid. The new venture is the brainchild of founder and CEO of Green Revolution, Jay Whelan. It was during recovery from a shoulder injury that Whelan -- a former Partner at management consultants, Accenture -- first had the idea to create a machine than could harness human power. ""I realized that there has got to be a way to take the energy that I was expending trying to rehabilitate my shoulder to create something useable,"" Whelan told CNN. Enlisting the help of an engineer, Whelan has spent the past 18 months perfecting the machine and has created a highly adaptable device which snaps on around the wheel of the bicycle. ""We didn't want people to have to purchase new cycling equipment. So we've made it so it fits on to all major brands of cycling equipment,"" Whelan said. ""A wire runs out from the bottom of each bike and connects to an electrical control cabinet."" So far, Whelan has received positive feedback from gym members who have used the equipment, and with the help of an interactive carbon calculator people can measure how much energy they are generating from their workout. The output from a single workout is only enough to power a light bulb or a laptop for about an hour and saves between two to six ounces of CO2. But power generation starts to stack up as more people get in the saddle. Green Revolution estimate that a group of around 20 bikes used throughout a year has the potential to create 3,600 kilowatt hours of electricity. That, they say, equates to lighting 72 homes for a month. Whelan says that there are around 36,000 health clubs in the U.S. alone, so the potential is there for the equipment to make a worthwhile impact on carbon emissions. ""If every club had one,"" he said, ""then that would create a substantial amount of energy."" Green Revolution say that their technology can easily be attached to most other types of cardio equipment. So if pedal power isn't your thing, you can use a cross trainer or a step machine to burn away those calorie and carbon ounces. Along with health clubs, Whelan is hoping that the corporate and university markets will prove lucrative for the company. He says that orders are already starting to roll in from all parts of the United States. In 2009, Whelan plans to take his Green Revolution to the European market.","New machine generates electricity from cycling workouts in the gym .

"(CNN) -- Witches, ghosts, a haunted house and a deadly plane crash: ""The Night Strangers"" has all the hallmarks of a good ghost story, but bestselling author Chris Bohjalian has put his own 21st-century spin on the supernatural genre in his frightening new novel. In the story, the haunted house is a charming fixer-upper in rural New Hampshire. Don't forget to ask the real estate agent about the mysterious basement door, nailed shut with 39 6-inch-long carriage bolts. The witches are self-proclaimed herbalists who go to great lengths to find the organic ingredients for their feel-good tinctures; just don't call them ""potions."" The ghosts are the victims of a commuter plane crash on Lake Champlain, but don't look for a ""Miracle on the Hudson"" finish to this water landing. At the heart of this creepy yarn is a not-quite-typical American family: Chip and Emily Linton and their twin 10-year-old daughters. Chip is an airline pilot with a bad case of survivor's guilt. Emily is suspicious of her new neighbors' intentions and her husband's sanity. While the twins try to fit in at their new school, one of the young girls begins to hear voices. With more than a dozen novels under his belt, ""The Night Strangers"" marks new territory for Bohjalian, who's tackled domestic violence in ""Secrets of Eden,"" a World War II love story in ""Skeletons at the Feast,"" and mental illness and ""The Great Gatsby"" in ""The Double Bind."" CNN recently spoke to Bohjalian (pronounced Bow-jail-yen) and the real-life inspiration behind ""The Night Strangers."" The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: What was the spark behind ""The Night Strangers""? Bohjalian: Along one of the foundation walls of the basement of my house in Vermont is a door. It's about five and a half feet tall and three feet wide and made of rough wooden planks. My guess is that it was added at some point after the 1898 Victorian above it was first constructed. When my wife and I moved into the house, it was nailed shut. That's right: nailed. There was a moldy pile of coal beside it, and so I convinced myself the door was merely a part of an old coal chute. Sure, I never found the exterior entrance to the chute, but that was a detail. Perhaps it was under a porch added at some point in the 1940s. A few years later, in the early 1990s, I finally pulled the door open. The project demanded a crowbar, a wrench and at one point an ax. After hours of toil, behind that door I found ... nothing. There was a slender cubicle the height and width of the door and maybe 18 inches deep. The walls were made of wood, and behind them was nothing but earth. In no way did it resemble a coal chute. It was more like a closet -- or a crypt behind which you might wall up a neighbor alive. So I nailed the door shut and made a mental note to steer clear of that corner of the basement for as long as we lived in the house. Nevertheless, on some level I understood even then that the basement door was going to lead to a novel. Now, it would take an airplane ditching one January afternoon in 2009 in the Hudson River before I would begin to understand what was going to exist behind that door. Like many thousands of other people, I raced to my television set and watched the evacuation of US Airways Flight 1549 as it occurred, staring enrapt as passengers stood on the wings and the plane floated amidst the waves. Perhaps it was the shape of the jet's cabin doors, but at that moment I thought of the door in my basement. The next morning, I wrote the following sentence: ""The door was presumed to have been the entry to a coal chute, a perfectly reasonable assumption since a small hillock of damp coal sat moldering before it."" And so begins ""The Night Strangers."" CNN: There's a plane crash in your book, reminiscent of the ""Miracle on the Hudson."" You went to great lengths to research plane crashes for the novel? Bohjalian: I did. I read a disturbing number of black box transcripts from doomed airliners, watched a lot of terrifying NTSB computer animations of crashes and interviewed pilots. But the most important thing I did to add authenticity to the novel was to visit Survival Systems in Groton, Connecticut. There I climbed into a flight suit, got strapped inside a Modular Egress Training Simulator and lowered into a 100,000-gallon tank of water. I was rolled 180 degrees so I was upside-down. The point of this, other than determining if my flight suit should have a diaper, was to get a taste of what it's like to exit a plane that has just crashed in the water. The METS is a cylinder that resembles an aircraft cabin. It has interchangeable exits, so Survival Systems can replicate egress from most types of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. The device is lowered into the tank, submerged underwater and then rolled upside down or to an off-angle, depending upon the scenario. The ceiling can be set on fire because, let's face it, when your plane or chopper has become a lawn dart, there's a chance that something is ablaze. The day I was dunked, there were three National Guardsmen being trained as well. I had an instructor in the simulator with me, and there were divers in the water around it to make sure that all of us got out with, worst case, a snootful of water. Altogether, I was dunked three times, twice rolled until I was upside-down. Escaping the simulator the two times I was strapped into a seat and had to push out exit windows while upside-down were particularly satisfying. CNN: Without giving away too much, your book features ghosts and witches, a first for you. What prompted you to write about the supernatural? Bohjalian: If you look at my personal library, you will notice that it ranges from Henry James to Steig Larsson, from Margaret Atwood to Max Hastings. There's Jane Austen and Tom Perrotta and volumes of letters from Civil War privates. It's pretty eclectic. And there's Shirley Jackson and Stephen King and Edgar Allan Poe. The Poe is a paperback I bought when I was a boy. It cost 45 cents when it was brand new. It's a little more squat and a little more wide than a traditional mass market edition, and has a red moon and a raven on the cover. I wrote my name atop the first page with a blue Magic Marker, the ink bleeding through the thin sheet onto page three, and the letters are evidence that my mother was on to something when she would insist that our dog had better handwriting than I did. It is one of the only books from my childhood I still own. I loved Poe when I was a boy. I loved all ghost stories. So I guess it was only a matter of time before I wrote one. Moreover, I hope I will never write the same book twice. So, why a ghost story? Well, I love them. They're fun to read -- and, yes, fun to write. And when I imagined the subject matter of a plane crash and a pilot's post-traumatic stress disorder, ghosts seemed as good a way in as any. CNN: What's next for you? Bohjalian: I just finished a love story set amidst the Armenian Genocide in 1915 and the World War I battle of Gallipoli. A young Boston graduate from Mount Holyoke and an Armenian engineer are two of the main characters. It's called ""The Sandcastle Girls."" I am half-Armenian, and three of my four Armenian great-grandparents died in the Genocide, and so I found the research particularly wrenching.

"(CNN) -- As the tough economy drags on, cost remains a leading consideration that people use to decide which mobile devices and wireless services they'll purchase. Dealnews.com just took a look at things that will probably cost consumers either more or less in 2012. Mobile devices featured most prominently on the site's list of 12 Things That Will Be Less Expensive in 2012. Here's a roundup of their findings, from a mobile-tech perspective: . Tablets . On the tablet front, writer Louis Ramirez says the Kindle Fire has, ""ahem, ignited a fire among tablet manufacturers as they scramble to match Amazon's $199 price tag. For consumers, the competition translates to better tablet bargains in 2012."" Smaller, cheaper Android-based e-reader tablets aren't really meant to compete directly with fully featured tablets such as the iPad or the Samsung Galaxy Tab. They are very different product types that appeal to different market niches -- and as such have significantly different price points. The Dealnews tablet deals page regularly lists special offers on new or refurbished tablets, both large and small, and fully featured or limited, on every mobile operating system. Will the iPad be cheaper in 2012? Maybe, if you don't need the latest model. Ramirez predicts that the iPad 2 will see a significant price drop in 2012. ""The [widely anticipated] iPad 3 will not feature a significant price drop (if any at all), but one thing is guaranteed -- Cupertino's forthcoming tablet will most certainly bring down the price of refurbished iPad 2s, as the iPad 2 did for its predecessor,"" he wrote. ""The iPad 3 may even cause resellers to offer more deals on new iPad 2 models as they try to move yesterday's tech to make room for Apple's latest and greatest."" E-readers . Dedicated e-reader devices such as the Amazon Kindle and the Kobo (which focus mainly on displaying books and long-format content, rather than Web-based services and apps) are likely to reach all-time low prices in 2012. According to Dealnews: ""Each new generation of Amazon's Kindle reader has chipped away at the e-book reader's price tag, sometimes by as much as 61%. Assuming there's a new Kindle in 2012 (rumor has it that an e-ink update with video support will debut), we expect to see continued price cuts on Amazon's popular e-book reader."" As I wrote last year, it's even possible that Amazon might start giving away the Kindle -- maybe in 2012. Notebooks . Notebook laptops are also a popular type of mobile device. According to Ramirez, 2012 might yield some especially good deals on refurbished Apple MacBook Air models. ""In 2011 the price of a refurbished, fourth-generation 11-inch MacBook Air dropped from $849 to $699 (17%). Not bad for a notebook that's single-handedly changing the laptop industry. Apple is bound to refresh its MacBook Air in 2012, and the new model (which would be the sixth generation) is guaranteed to drive refurb prices down even lower. Don't care for a refurb unit? In 2011, we also saw aggressive deals on new, current fifth-generation MacBook Airs with prices dropping from $999 to $850 (14%)."" GPS units . As consumers get used to using GPS-enabled smartphones and tablets for navigation, Dealnews predicted that standalone GPS units (such as those sold by Garmin) will get cheaper than ever. ""In 2011, units that were once fetching around $160 reached price-lows of just $70."" In fact, Ramirez wrote, ""No gadget is as close to extinction as the GPS unit."" However, if the recent National Transportation Safety Board recommendation to ban cell phone use by drivers in cars is implemented by any states or municipalities, sales of GPS units might see a resurgence -- since the recommendation exempted devices specifically ""designed to support the driving task."" What will get more expensive . What will cost mobile users more in 2012? The Dealnews list of 11 Things That Will Be More Expensive in 2012 contained only one reference to mobile: data plans. As I wrote last year, perhaps the most important development in the U.S. mobile landscape in 2011 was that all but one of the major carriers have abandoned unlimited data plans in favor of tiered service. This comes as the carriers are rolling out high-speed 4G networks, and U.S. mobile users are developing a strong taste for data-intensive services like streaming media. If you're on a tiered plan and start using a lot more data, you could end up with a large surprise bill -- or throttled service. Determined price-conscious consumers have been trying to find tricks to get unlimited data on tiered plans. But the carriers can catch on to this -- Verizon recently closed a loophole that allowed this. In October, the Federal Communications Commission said it might issue new rules to prevent bill shock. The major U.S. carriers said they would voluntarily start issuing text alerts to customers who near their phone plan caps. However, it's unclear how fast or consistently this alert feature will roll out, and whether it will include alerts related to data consumption. So to control your costs, if you use data-intensive mobile services, your best bets are to use Wi-Fi whenever possible and to install apps or other tools that allow you to keep a close eye on your data usage. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Analyst predicts that in 2012, the iPad 2 will see a significant price drop .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The U.S. Secret Service is looking into a controversial column by an Atlanta Jewish newspaper publisher that mulled the assassination of an American president. Andrew Adler, owner and publisher of the Atlanta Jewish Times, wrote a January 13 column about the threat of Iran to Israel. He posed three options for the Jewish state to counter the Iranian regime. One of them called for a ""hit on a president in order to preserve Israel's existence."" ""Give the go-ahead for U.S. based Mossad agents to take out a president deemed unfriendly to Israel in order for the current vice president to take his place and forcefully dictate that the United States' policy includes its helping the Jewish state obliterate its enemies."" U.S. Secret Service spokesman George Ogilvie told CNN Saturday, ""We are aware of it. We are taking the appropriate investigative steps."" Adler could not be reached for comment, but the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, a wire service for Jewish newspapers in North America, quoted Adler on Friday as saying ""I very much regret it. I wish I hadn't made reference to it at all."" Adler -- who said he's gotten a lot of flak for the column -- said he would issue an apology in the next edition of the weekly newspaper, the JTA reported. The column, titled ""What would you do?"" doesn't mention President Barack Obama's name, but U.S. Jewish groups that strongly denounced the column read the words as a reference to Obama himself. The column also refers to the administration's ""never ending 'Alice in Wonderland' belief that diplomacy is the answer,"" an apparent dig at the Obama White House's foreign policy efforts at dialogue with such countries as Iran. ""The suggestion by anyone, in this case a Jewish newspaper publisher, that Israel should consider assassinating President Obama is shocking beyond belief,"" said Dov Wilker, director of the American Jewish Committee in Atlanta. ""While we acknowledge Mr. Adler's apology, we are flabbergasted that he could ever say such a thing in the first place. How could he even conceive of such a twisted idea?"" said Wilker. ""Mr. Adler surely owes immediate apologies to President Obama, as well as to the State of Israel and his readership, the Atlanta Jewish community."" The White House declined to comment Saturday on the column. Abraham H. Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said Adler's ""lack of judgment as a publisher, editor and columnist raises serious questions as to whether he's fit to run a newspaper."" ""There is absolutely no excuse, no justification, no rationalization for this kind of rhetoric. It doesn't even belong in fiction. These are irresponsible and extremist words. It is outrageous and beyond the pale. An apology cannot possibly repair the damage. ""Irresponsible rhetoric metastasizes into more dangerous rhetoric. The ideas expressed in Mr. Adler's column reflect some of the extremist rhetoric that unfortunately exists -- even in some segments of our community -- that maliciously labels President Obama as an 'enemy of the Jewish people,'"" Foxman said. Simon Wiesenthal Center associate dean Rabbi Abraham Cooper called the remarks ""irresponsible and reprehensible"" and said they ""must be publicly condemned by Jewish leaders across the ideological and political spectrum."" ""We take small comfort from the apology â€” what a shanda!"" Cooper said, using the Yiddish word for something shameful or scandalous. JTA also quoted Opher Aviran, the Israeli consul-general in Atlanta as saying he was ""appalled at this deranged and morally repugnant assertion. We condemn such calls in the strongest possible terms."" The Atlanta Jewish Times, a weekly focused on the Atlanta Jewish community, was founded in 1925 as the Southern Israelite.","Atlanta Jewish Times piece suggests Israel kill U.S. president ""to preserve Israel's existence""

"(CNN) -- Android is finally getting Chromed out. Google launched a beta version of Chrome for Android smartphones and tablets Tuesday, delivering a mobile version of the popular desktop web browser after a very long wait. Indeed, both Android and Chrome launched more than three years ago, and users have demanded unification ever since. Why bemoan the long wait? Much like the company's other products and services, the new Chrome app hooks wonderfully into the Google universe, giving those immersed in desktop Google apps even more incentive to choose Android as their mobile OS. So, naturally, we would hope — nay, expect — that Chrome would be the default browser for the Android OS. But this hasn't been the case. Android users have been forced to use a generic, stock browser (unceremoniously named ""Browser"") that's inferior to not only Chrome, but also other browsers available in the Android Market. Dolphin, anyone? Google had a reason to take its time: It wanted to do Chrome for Android right. ""We didn't want to just push out Chrome light,"" said Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Google Chrome, in an interview. ""Our goal was to get all of Chrome onto Android."" Which is exactly what Pichai and his team did. It's a full version of the Chrome browser for Android, still performing as adroitly as ever without losing the features that come in the desktop version. There are clear perks in using Chrome instead of other Android browsers. If you're already a desktop Chrome user, your bookmarks will be synced across all your browser versions after signing into your Google account. Even cooler, if you've left pages open on your laptop at home, you can access those same open tabs from your mobile Chrome browser. Search terms you've entered on your desktop browser also carry over to Chrome for Android, saving precious time and screen tapping. But most important of all, Chrome is fast. Really freaking fast. When typing in an address into the search bar, for instance, Chrome predicts what page you're going to visit and starts loading it in the browser background. So by the time you've clicked ""go,"" most of the site has already loaded. To be sure, the Chrome browser itself is nothing new. It's been around since 2008, when Google first decided to take on Microsoft, Mozilla and others by casting its lot in the browser wars. The move proved to be a smart one: For nearly the past year and a half, Chrome has slowly increased market share, according to various browser analytics firms' estimates. In fact, Chrome actually surpassed Firefox, once the most popular alternative to the dominant Internet Explorer (which still holds about 50 percent of desktop browser share). After Tuesday's debut for Android devices — of which there are more than 700,000 activations daily — Chrome's adoption numbers will only escalate. But the Chrome release raises a number of questions about the new browser app, and the relationship that the Android and Chrome teams have with one another. When the Chrome team first announced it was creating a Chrome-based operating system — later to be known as Chrome OS — it was difficult to resolve how the software wouldn't come into conflict with Android. After all, Android is the premier operating system for all things mobile (smartphones, tablets). Except, that is, for Google's version of the netbook: the Chromebook. So the question is, Which OS owns what? Is it Chrome for netbooks, and Android for everything else? Pichai thinks there's room enough for both operating systems. The Chrome OS, he says, can be seen ""as a different computing paradigm."" It's one that, ""end-to-end, is fully based on the web."" ""Native mobile applications are thriving, but web apps are going to thrive as well,"" Pichai said. While it's nice to see the two camps playing nicely in Tuesday's release, it's not without a caveat. As of Tuesday's launch, Chrome for Android is only available for smartphones and tablets running Android version 4.0 (a.k.a. Ice Cream Sandwich). At this point, this includes just a handful of phones and tablets. And of course, it's Chrome ""beta"" for Android, so don't expect everything to work perfectly. Still, Pichai is confident the Chrome team will drop the ""beta"" title sooner rather than later. ""After announcing Chrome the first time, we took it out of beta in three months,"" Pichai said. ""I'd expect this to happen here in the near future."" And as it stands, after Chrome moves out of beta, the plan is for Chrome to take the place of Android's default browser permanently.

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VICE) -- In 2007, we stood on the Israeli side of the Erez crossing , where we tried and failed to get into the Gaza Strip. Inside, a Palestinian civil war was taking place, pitting political and philosophical rivals Hamas and Fatah against each other. After a succession of assassinations, kidnappings and street battles, Hamas took complete control of Gaza, and for the first time in its history, had to figure out how to run a government. In 2011, when the post-Mubarak government of Egypt decided to start letting small numbers of folks into Gaza through their Rafah crossing, we knew it was our chance to finally get a rare glimpse of the embattled Gaza Strip and to see what life was like under the rule of Hamas. Much of Hamas' popularity within Gaza comes from the fact that they are seen as incorruptible, and when they took power they put a concerted effort into stomping out all forms of vice in on their turf. But the same tunnels that allow Hamas to smuggle in weapons from Egypt also allow for a steady flow of drugs. When we met the members of the Hamas vice cops, they were eager to show off their ""trophy case"" which held a wide assortment of some of the drugs and paraphernalia they've confiscated on raids on homes around the Gaza Strip. Skull-shaped bongs, cocaine, hash, even tall-boy cans of Egyptian beer ... they had it all. But what stood out among all the standard illicit drugs was one called Tramadol. This prescription painkiller has become the drug of choice for young people looking to escape the reality of life in Gaza , something we witnessed during an evening stroll through Gaza City's central park. See the rest of Crime and Punishment in the Gaza Strip . Combine the widespread Tramadol with Hamas' strict approach to law and order, and soon you have a lot of young men behind bars. We visited Gaza's central prison, where drug users and drug smugglers alike are locked in a communal cell, their sentences ranging anywhere from one month, to death by hanging. Elsewhere in the same facility we met a woman who was imprisoned for the crime of having a child out of wedlock and another for helping her son escape from Gaza. Hamas' firm hand seems to have resulted in a kind of orderliness that is not often seen in places that are as impoverished as Gaza. But it is order with a distinctly authoritarian flavor. The Hamas government operates in an environment of paranoia that has them on guard not only against the outside world, but against their brothers and sisters in Fatah, and against ordinary Gazans whose poverty they fear could tempt them into spying for Israel. An authoritarian government operating within prison walls and under economic siege ... it sounds like the setup for a Kurt Russell movie, except that it's real.","VICE gets a rare glimpse inside the Gaza Strip to see what life is like under Hamas rule .

"(CNN) -- Occupy London protesters who have been camped outside the landmark St. Paul's Cathedral for the past four months lost their court bid to avoid eviction Wednesday in a decision made by London's Court of Appeal. Last month, the High Court ruled in favor of the City of London Corporation, the body that runs London's financial district, which applied for an eviction order after the protesters failed to abide by a previous order to pack up the camp. The Occupy London group then filed an appeal against the ruling at the Court of Appeal. Wednesday, the three judges of the court refused them the permission to appeal. Michael Paget, the lawyer representing the Occupy London group, said the group doesn't intend to file another legal challenge. ""The occupy message has been heard and will continue to be heard. It has made a difference and will continue to make a difference."" The activists, who set up camp outside the cathedral October 15, had been protesting against corporate greed and economic inequality. Many of the tents set up by the Occupy activists around St. Paul's are on what the corporation designates as a public road. St. Paul's suspended its own legal action against the activists in November, after a number of senior cathedral figures resigned over the threat to evict them. ""Peaceful protest is a democratic right but the camp is clearly in breach of highway and planning law,"" said Stuart Fraser, policy chairman for the City of London Corporation."" I would call on protesters to comply with the decision of the courts and remove their tents and equipment voluntarily right away.""","Last month, the High Court ruled in favor of the group that wanted to evict .

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- Authorities in Uganda were investigating the death of a U.S. reality television producer whose work included ""The Amazing Race"" and ""Whale Wars,'"" officials said Wednesday. Andrew Kaweesi, commander of the Kampala Metropolitan Police Force, said that, based on preliminary toxicology results, officials believe Jeff Rice died of a drug overdose. Kaweesi said he did not know what drug may have been involved. An official police statement will be issued Thursday, according to Kaweesi. Rice's body was found late last week in a hotel room, according to reports. Sally Blackman, Rice's wife and business partner, announced his death Sunday. ""Jeff was on a film production in Uganda and was doing what he loves. ... He was a true asset to the film industry worldwide and Africa was his 'home,'"" Blackman wrote. The nature of Rice's work in Kampala was not immediately known. Earlier Wednesday, Blackman wrote CNN in an e-mail that ""this is a tragic event and it is unbelievable to read the messages of how many lives (Rice) has positively influenced."" CNN was trying to contact her and other family members for comment, including their reaction to the assertion Rice died of an overdose. Rice is survived by daughters, ages 2 and 7. The U.S. Embassy in Uganda referred questions on the investigation to Kampala police. Rice, who also served as a production facilitator, and Blackman were co-owners of SB Productions in Durban, South Africa. Rice was a native of Oklahoma. He worked as a freelance facilitator for the latest season of CBS's ""The Amazing Race,"" which wrapped up shooting months ago. Rice was not working with the show at the time of his death. Bertram van Munster, co-creator and executive producer of ""The Amazing Race,"" said in a statement that the show's team ""is shocked and deeply saddened to learn of Jeff's untimely death. ... He was well liked and his work was highly respected."" Rice served as a production facilitator in 2010 for SyFy's ""Destination Truth,"" the show's executive producer said in a statement. Shooting took place in Madagascar and Namibia. He also assisted in production of ""Whale Wars"" for Animal Planet. ""(Jeff) became an absolute expert in how to do productions in countries all over the continent, from Tanzania to Madagascar,"" said Liz Bronstein, executive producer for Lizard Trading Co., which produces ""Whale Wars."" Rice ""was given a name by the Zulu people: Lengai, which means 'a gift from God."" I've never met anyone like Jeff. He made working in the toughest environments look effortless,"" Bronstein said in a statement. Bronstein said Rice wrote her e-mails last week from Uganda indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March.

"(CNN) -- It sounds far too good to be true: a salary of more than $100,000, a free home on a palm-fringed island and all the snorkeling you can be bothered with. The successful applicant will have plenty of time to explore the Great Barrier Reef. However, it is true and a very clever marketing ploy to boot. Australia's Tourism Queensland has garnered worldwide media coverage by advertising the ""best job in the world"" -- the post of caretaker on Hamilton island in the Great Barrier Reef. The six-month contract, according to Tourism Queensland, comes with flexible working hours and the successful applicant's ""key responsibilities"" include exploring the area to discover what is on offer and to report back weekly via blogs, photo diaries, video updates and media interviews. Sounds taxing doesn't it? The group said other responsibilities would include cleaning the pool, which comes with your free home, feeding the fish and collecting the mail (this would be done by joining the aerial postal service for a day or two to get a good view of the neighboring islands). You might also take time out from your busy schedule to check out the turtles and passing whales. On top of the six-figure salary you'll get return airfares from your nearest capital city, transport on the island, travel insurance, computer and camera gear and travel to other islands in the Great Barrier Reef. No academic qualifications are required but you must be a good swimmer and enjoy snorkeling, be adventurous and have good communication skills. Where do I sign up I hear you ask? Tourism Queensland is asking for a 60-second video explanation of why you'd be great for the job and that you fill out their online application form at www.islandreefjob.com .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- One of three suspects in a videotaped beating of a gay man has been arrested, Atlanta police said Saturday. Christopher Cain, 18, was taken into custody around midnight and charged with aggravated assault and robbery, said a statement from police spokesman Carlos Campos. Three men were seen in the video shouting anti-gay slurs as they beat, punched and kicked Brandon White, 20. Police have identified two other suspects but they have not yet been arrested nor have their names been released. White was attacked February 4 outside a convenience store in a working class neighborhood in southwest Atlanta. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed doubled to $10,000 a reward for information leading to arrests. Meanwhile Saturday, community leaders and neighborhood residents rallied outside the convenience store in support of White. ""When you see something going wrong, you must do what you're doing here today,' said U.S. Rep. John Lewis. White did not report the attack at first but stepped forward after a video went viral on the internet. The video showed three men punching and kicking White after he stepped out of the JVC Grocery and Deli. The men, believed to be members of a gang called Jack City, yelled: ""No f----ts in Jack City."" Later, the store's surveillance video showed White, dressed in a purple shirt and black jeans with a cell phone to his left ear, exit the store along with another man. As soon as they stepped outside, White was accosted by his attackers. The surveillance video captured eight men standing around watching, two of them with video cameras in hand. One man lunged at White with a tire in his hands. ""If a straight person can walk to the store, I should be able to do the same thing,"" White said. ""I could have died that day. They are monsters. At this point I am beyond mad."" He said he could not at first even bring himself to watch the video; he was so humiliated and embarrassed. But after its wide circulation, White decided to talk to the police. ""Once they put it out there they set themselves up,""said. ""I feel I was violated. The scars run deeper than anyone will know. The physical pain, I can get over that. My thing is: Who's to say they won't come after me again? Who's to say they won't kill me?"" FBI agents are also investigating the case to determine whether it meets criteria for prosecution under the federal hate crimes statute. White said he could not comment on that aspect of the investigation. U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said her office is looking into potential civil rights violations based on sexual orientation. Georgia does not have a state hate crimes statute. ""The actions depicted in the video are appalling and unacceptable in our community, and we encourage anyone with information about this video to contact the FBI or Atlanta Police,"" Yates said. Pittsburgh community residents said the corner where White was attacked is notorious for violence. They called for the JVC store to be shut down and asked for beefed up security. Those who attended Saturday's rally said it was up to everyone to make sure this kind of attack does not occur again. ""This is not a one day campaign. this is not a one week campiagn, this is a lifetime campaign,"" said Cleta Winslow, an Atlanta City Council member. Last year, the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs released a study that showed that hate crimes committed against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) and HIV-affected people were on the rise in America. In 2010, the coalition reported a 13% rise in LGBT hate crimes and documented 27 murders, a 23% increase from 2009. State Rep. Simone Bell, who is openly gay, told CNN affiliate WSB TV that she hopes this case will pave the way for anti-hate crime legislation in Georgia. CNN's Maria P. White contributed to this report.","NEW: Residents and community leaders rally at the site of the attack .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexico's conservative ruling party has picked a former congresswoman as its nominee for the nation's top job. If she wins, she would become the country's first female president. Sunday's decision by the National Action Party marks the first time one of Mexico's three major political parties has tapped a woman for the presidential race. ""It opens up the possibility of a very high-profile, close contest,"" said Mireille Roccatti, a professor at Mexico's Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education. Vazquez Mota, 51, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol last year that her gender gives her an edge. ""To me, being a woman is a very important competitive advantage in my country ... but not only because there are more (female) voters. Because in this country, like in the majority of the world's countries, we have worked hard, we have made an effort, because nobody has given us anything,"" she said. She has emphasized her desire to be Mexico's first female president, and pointed to her qualifications for the job. ""I do not want to be president because I am a woman. Being a woman is important, but it's not the most important. I want to be president because we have the talent and the platform and the vision of a Mexico that we want for all Mexicans, not only for a select few,"" she told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Before her political career took off, Vazquez Mota studied economics and made a living with self-help lectures and a bestselling book, ""God, Please Make Me a Widow: The Challenge of Being Yourself."" She was Mexico's first female secretary of social development when then-President Vicente Fox named her to that Cabinet post in 2000. In 2006, she became the nation's first female education secretary under President Felipe Calderon. She later served as federal congresswoman for two years before stepping aside in September 2011 to focus on her presidential bid. Vazquez Mota told supporters Sunday that she is confident and ready to face off against Enrique Pena Nieto, whose Institutional Revolutionary Party ruled Mexico for seven decades, until 2000. ""Today the internal strife ends and we will start a new path to defeat the true adversary of Mexico, who represents authoritarianism and the worst of antidemocratic practices,"" Vazquez Mota said. But with a controversial drug war raging and a sluggish economy, the former congresswoman faces a tough political battle leading up to the July 1 presidential election. ""Congratulations and welcome to the democratic contest @JosefinaVM. Let it be for the good of Mexico,"" Pena Nieto said in a tweet directed at Vazquez Mota after the National Action Party selected her on Sunday. ""Thank you. Let it be for the citizens,"" Vazquez Mota replied. Pena Nieto, the former governor of Mexico's most populous state, is leading in polls, but he isn't her only opponent. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City who lost the presidency in a disputed vote in 2006, is vying for the job once again as a candidate for the leftist Democratic Revolution Party. In a January poll by Mexico's Consulta Mitofsky, 41 percent of voters backed Pena Nieto, 23 percent supported Vazquez Mota and 18 percent supported Lopez Obrador. But 18 percent of those polled hadn't made up their minds. The survey of 1,000 voters had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Calderon, who won the presidency in 2006, has been mired in a controversial war on drug cartels in which more than 47,000 people have been killed since he took office, according to Mexican government statistics. By law, he cannot run again. Vazquez Mota said Sunday that she is grateful to Calderon for his leadership. ""With valor and decisiveness he has faced organized crime and has worked tirelessly for the security of our families. ... I am proud of what he has built for Mexico, and the best way to demonstrate my loyalty will be to become the first female president of Mexico on July 1,"" she said.

Shoichet, Mario Gonzalez, Rey Rodriguez, Krupskaia Alis and Lucia Navarro contributed to this report.","Josefina Vazquez Mota will compete in the July 1 election .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Qin Xiaona used to visit the suburban Xiaotangshan Sanatorium in the summer to escape the scorching temperature in the city. Now she comes here to turn up the heat on a subject close to her heart. Animal rights advocate Qin Xiaona mixes leftovers to feed stray cats. ""This is our experiment to save the city's stray cats,"" said the 62-year-old retired TV journalist, as she carried two plastic containers full of leftovers out of her villa surrounded by lush greenery. Calling out a dozen snoozing cats by the bushes, Qin watched them rush over and devour the rice mixed with pork and fish. Qin, who heads the Capital Animal Welfare Association, estimates there are some 200,000 stray cats in Beijing, after her group spent more than two years studying the population. She detailed the precarious state of the felines in an 80,000-word report and decided to start her rescue mission with the 72 cats roaming the sanatorium's sprawling ground. ""The health bureau runs this place and agreed to let us take care of the cats,"" Qin said, lifting up a female kitten to check the healing of the surgery wound on its stomach. ""We have already neutered and vaccinated a third of them."" ""We convinced the health officials that stray cats could be a more effective and environmentally friendly way of rodent control than placing 15 tons of rat poisons across the city every year,"" she explained. This is the kind of win-win solution that Qin hopes to replicate throughout the capital, where stray animals are frequently culled by the government on fears of spreading diseases or attacking humans. For Qin and other members of her NGO, saving stray cats is just one uphill battle in their war against animal cruelty in a culture that often treats man's four-legged friends with little favor. For over 15 years and with meager funding, they have been setting up shelters to house abandoned pets, persuading restaurants to take dog meat off the menus and, most importantly, lobbying legislators to pass an animal welfare law -- a goal that nevertheless remains distant. ""Many in the government and society still consider us peripheral and alternative -- and don't recognize and approve our work,"" Qin said. When Beijing won the bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympics seven years ago, she and fellow activists perceived a perfect catalyst in expanding animal rights. To their dismay, the authorities have since stepped up their campaigns against animals -- pets and strays alike -- aimed at ""cleaning up"" the city for the Games. In 2006 Beijing implemented a controversial ""one family, one dog"" rule for urban households and required such pet dogs no taller than 35 centimeters (14 inches). ""It is such a ridiculous law,"" Qin raised her voice, still livid. ""Anyone with a little understanding of animals would know that the temperament of dogs has nothing to do with their size, but depends on their breed and training."" Although official policies are difficult to modify, Qin feels her efforts have slowly changed the minds of many ordinary citizens. ""People's attitude toward animals reflects their attitude toward fellow human beings,"" she offered. ""We should promote love, not hatred, from an early age on."" Qin has seen more young people grow receptive to the concept of animal welfare and now also counts some unlikely volunteers -- including a former policewoman -- among her 600-strong group. With the Olympics around the corner, however, Qin has become jittery amid reports of an intensifying government crackdown on animals. ""I feel my heart is in my throat,"" she admitted. ""Many officials get money and quotas for culling -- they simply find it so much easier than caring for animals."" As she finished feeding the cats at the sanatorium, Qin received a phone call from an animal lover living in a residential compound near the Olympic district. ""They are crying for help for the 30 stray cats there,"" she said. ""They have neutered and vaccinated 90 percent of those cats, but officials still sealed the cats in the basement with cement because of health and safety concerns during the Games."" Frantically dialing, Qin tried to reach the right person before time ran out for the felines. ""Innocent animals shouldn't have to pay the ultimate price for the Olympics,"" she said. Steven Jiang is a Beijing-based freelance writer and former CNN producer.","Clamp down on stray cats and animals in China's capital leading up to Olympics .

"(CNN) -- The saber-rattling between Iran and Israel conjures fears of mass casualties and a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Israel has threatened to attack Iran to stop it from obtaining nuclear weapons. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and has threatened to strike first against enemies who threaten its national interests. The tough talk makes it easy to forget that Israel and Iran have not always been enemies. The Jews of Israel and Persians of Iran have had a rich and nuanced relationship dating back thousands of years. They have enjoyed an ""overwhelmingly positive connection"" for centuries, said Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council and author of ""Treacherous Alliance: The Secret Dealings of Israel, Iran, and the United States."" In fact, Israeli Jews grow up reading a Bible story about the Persian leader Cyrus the Great, who is said to have liberated Jews and allowed them to return from exile to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem, said David Menashri, an Israeli expert on Israeli-Iranian relations. ""In the back of the historical memory of the Israelis, when you speak about Iran, Iran is considered to be a good friend of Israel,"" he said. After the birth of the nation of Israel in 1948, the countries enjoyed a ""honeymoon"" that lasted until just before the 1979 Islamic revolution, said Menashri, professor emeritus of Tel Aviv University and president of the Academic Center of Law and Business in the Israeli city of Ramat Gan. Before the revolution, when the shah-led monarchy governed Iran, Israel and Iran shared a pro-Western bent. They cooperated overtly and covertly on economic, political and security issues. Israel viewed Iran as part of its strategy to develop ties with non-Arab states on the region's periphery, such as Turkey and Ethiopia. It also saw Iran as an important way station for Jews fleeing persecution in Iraq, said Uri Bialer, a professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Israel's ties with Iran were chiefly motivated by ""a single word with three letters -- O-I-L,"" he said. Iran earned money selling oil to the Jewish state. The shah also saw in Israel another pro-American ally with influence in the United States. ""Under the shah, Israeli-Iranian ties were multilayered and complex,"" said Haim Malka, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""The shah had a similar interest in building strategic ties with a growing military power that had a record of defeating Arab armies, though he was careful not to publicly embrace Israel too warmly,"" Malka said. It was ""a love affair without marriage,"" Menashri said, quoting an Iranian diplomat. ""You don't need to have a formal contract to have a happy marriage. You are happy together."" Even though Iran never formally recognized Israel, Israel operated a permanent delegation in Iran until the overthrow of the shah in 1979. That event ushered in an Islamic republic led by the Ayatollah Khomeini and marked a turning point in ties between Israel and Iran. The Islamic republic, led by Shiite clerics in the predominantly Shiite nation, saw Israel as an illegitimate state with no right to exist, certainly not amid Muslim nations. Despite harsh rhetoric, though, Khomeini ""didn't want to get into a confrontation with Israel,"" said Ervand Abrahamian, a professor of Iranian and Middle Eastern history at Baruch College of the City University of New York. One reason relations weren't worse in the 1980s: Israel and Iran had a common enemy in Iraq, a country that fought an eight-year war with Iran. Israel even supplied weapons to Iran to help it fight Iraq, Abrahamian and other analysts say. And Israeli warplanes bombed a nuclear reactor in Iraq in 1981, an act seen as beneficial to both Israel and Iran. Even as ""Khomeini called Israel a 'cancerous tumor,' the Israelis lobbied Washington to boost Iran's defenses and bring Tehran 'back into the Western fold,' "" Parsi said. In the years after the Iran-Iraq war, however, Israel began to regard Iran and its support of global terror as a chief threat. The Islamic republic supported anti-Israeli movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza -- groups that Israel and the United States classify as terrorist organizations. Iran also stirred anxiety in Israel by revving up its nuclear program. Iran harbored ambitions to lead the Muslim world in the fight to liberate Palestinians and wrest Jerusalem, one of Islam's holy cities and Judaism's holiest city, from Israel, said Vali Nasr, the author of the ""Shia Revival."" Yet Iran maintained a pragmatic instinct, said Parsi, who cited a 2003 Iranian idea to lower the political temperatures and stave off Iran's isolation. ""Much like Malaysia, Iran would be an Islamic state that did not formally recognize Israel and would occasionally criticize Israeli policies, but would refrain from directly confronting Israel. Iran would get out of Israel's hair in return for an end to Israeli pressure on the United States to isolate and contain Iran,"" Parsi said. The concept didn't get off the ground. After he was elected in 2005, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad began spouting anti-Israeli and anti-Western rhetoric. He enraged Jews by denying the Holocaust and alarmed them with virulent attacks on Israel. His rhetoric stoked fears in Israel and elsewhere that a major world leader would want to destroy the Jewish state. Yet it has been Iran's nuclear program that has raised the prospects of armed conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will act to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. U.S. President Barack Obama pledged support for Israel this week but also urged more time for diplomacy and harsh sanctions to have an effect. As the possibility looms of an Israeli military strike on Iranian nuclear sites, the two countries appear to already be engaged in what many have called a shadow war. After Iranian nuclear scientists were assassinated in Tehran, Iran blamed Israel. When attackers targeted Israeli diplomats this year in India, Thailand, Georgia and Azerbaijan, Israel blamed Iran. Underneath the political tensions, though, some measure of goodwill persists for some. ""Despite three decades of animosity, tens of thousands of Iranian Jews in the United States and Israel still have a strong cultural attachment to Iran,"" said Malka, the Middle East expert in Washington. Many Iranian Jews maintain contact with friends and relatives who are among the roughly 20,000 Jews in Iran, Malka said, and Israeli radio beams programming in Farsi inside Iran. Connections between the two peoples are underscored by the Jewish holiday of Purim, which began Wednesday night. It commemorates a Bible story in which Haman, an adviser to the Persian king, plots unsuccessfully to kill Jews, . The story resonates with Israelis worried about the Iranian president. Many of them compare him to a figure far worse than Haman. ""They speak about him as Hitler,"" Menashri said.","Israelis fondly think about Cyrus the Great, the ancient Persian king .
During the rule of the shah, Israel and Iran forged ""multilayered"" ties .
In the 1980s, Israel and Iran had a common enemy in Saddam Hussein .

"(CNN) -- Shamshiri in Tel Aviv is as busy as any restaurant might be during the lunch hour rush. Nestled in a part of the market area known as Little Persia, Shamshiri is run by Jews from Iran, providing a home away from home for other Iranian Jews. Moluk, the matriarch of her family, is just one of tens of thousands of Iranian Jews who immigrated to Israel during the course of the last 60 years. She arrived in Israel in 1964 from Isfahan, where her sister still lives to this day. In Iran there are an estimated 25,000 Jews remaining in the country, making it the largest Middle Eastern population center for the religion outside of Israel. Moluk, like many Iranian Jews in Israel, still keeps in touch with relatives back home. She says there are no problems between Jews and Muslims in Iran. Jews, she explains, can practice their faith freely in Iran and are not persecuted. But for most in Israel, talk of Iran focuses on the country's nuclear program and what the government here believes is Tehran's drive to develop nuclear weapons. The Iranian government steadfastly maintains its program is peaceful in nature. For Iranian Jews living in Israel, the debate about their homeland cannot be escaped and in their market community in Tel Aviv there's a keen awareness of the potential for an Israeli strike. Take Mansour, a spice shop owner. He came to Israel from Iran forty years ago. He says the Iran nuclear issue is a big mess, hard to understand with both Israel and Iran waiting to see who will act first. There are between 100,000 and 200,000 Iranian Jews and their descendants in Israel, and despite the hostile relations between Israel and Iran, they're still able to closely follow events in their country of origin through internet radio stations like Radis In which broadcasts from Tel Aviv. One caller from Iran to the station says he won't be voting in the country's upcoming elections as he believes they will be rigged. Barouch Davidi, one of the station's presenters, says that after hearing stories from other callers, he believes the economic sanctions are really beginning to hurt the Iranian regime. It's a view shared by analyst Meir Javedanfar, himself originally from Iran and who is now at the Herzliya Interdisciplinary Center college in Israel. He says the regime in Tehran is in danger because the economic price being paid for its nuclear program as a result of sanctions is actually ""a bigger existential threat to the Islamic Republic of Iran than to the State of Israel."" The sanctions are beginning to bite, says Javedanfar. A strike by Israel, he continues, should be only as a last resort. A strike, he argues, would be ""bad for two reasons. Number one, it would help the longevity of the Iranian regime. Number two, it could motivate it more to build the bomb."" Back at the restaurant, Moluk is not concerned about the tension over Iran's nuclear program. ""I don't believe it,"" she says. ""It's a bluff. We believe in good things. God told us to believe in the best."" On her wall, as if a throwback to earlier and presumably better times for Moluk and before the creation of the Islamic Republic of Iran, hangs a portrait of the late Shah and his son. Iranian Jews like Moluk and Mansour may be hoping for the best but preparing for the worst as politicians negotiate the future in the corridors of power, far away from this bustling Tel Aviv neighborhood.","Iran is largest Middle Eastern population center for Jews outside of Israel .

"New York (CNN) -- The BP oil spill is defining the political landscape in the summer of 2010 as much as the rise of the Tea Party did in 2009. It is driving the national debate, and changing the way we think about both government and business. Of course, the oil spill's impact is much bigger than politics. One of our nation's most beautiful and historic coastal regions is under threat, whole industries have been put on hold, and we can only guess at the long term environmental and economic impact. But there's no denying that the oil spill is shifting political fortunes with implications that will be felt throughout the midterm elections. A case-study is being written in real time: It's an object lesson in how events can overtake politics in ways no one can anticipate. There are no winners and losers in the wake of environmental devastation, but there are those who are seizing the spotlight and those who are starting to smell like low tide on the Bayou. Charlie Crist: The governor of Florida had been on his political heels after leaving the GOP in the face of a strong challenge for the open Senate seat from conservative phenom Marco Rubio and declaring his plan to run as an independent for the office. But the oil spill has given Crist the chance to be seen as a leader above the partisan political fray, focused on solving problems that affect all Floridians, and liberated from the party infighting that seems so small by comparison. Even the indictment of his former party chairman Jim Greer on corruption charges hasn't been able to stop Crist's post-declaration of independence momentum. A new Florida Chamber of Commerce poll shows Crist breaking out with a double-digit lead over Rubio. Bobby Jindal: The rising star Republican governor briefly became a political punch-line after his sing-song Kenneth-the-pageboy delivery of a nationwide address. But the youngest governor in the nation was always a more impressive figure than the speech sound bites portrayed, compiling an impressive record of reform in Louisiana during his term. Now, he has emerged as close to a post-9/11 Rudy Giuliani as the slow moving crisis has produced -- a hands-on leader, constructively channeling the frustrations of his citizens on the ground. His recent argument against the drilling moratorium may have raised some environmental eyebrows, but he's looking at what he can still salvage in the local economy. My guess is that he'll be on the VP short-list for any 2012 GOP presidential nominee. A new energy bill: During the 2008 campaign, moving America toward energy independence and kicking our addiction to oil was one policy proposal which was broadly embraced by the left, right and center. Both Obama and McCain backed cap-and-trade climate-change legislation as part of their energy plan. But in the wake of the great recession, enthusiasm for environmental aspects of energy planning lost much of their political and popular support -- until, that is, BP. Now a bipartisan group of senators are optimistic that some sort of energy legislation will pass this year, possibly with a scaled-down cap-and-trade plan that affects only electric utilities. And I can't help but wonder if the evident risks of offshore deep water oil drilling also could cause renewed focus on the comparatively safe option of drilling at the Artic National Wildlife Refuge. Sharron Angle: The Tea Party-backed candidate wrestled the Nevada Republican nomination for U.S. Senate from GOP establishment candidate Sue Lowden earlier this month, giving her the slot to run against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. But her ideological absolutism, such as calls to end the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, now looks like dangerously naïve policy bumper-stickers that have nothing to do with solving problems in the real world. This disconnect can be counted on to derail the candidacies of other Tea Party-backed candidates come the fall, because calls for less government and less regulation seem out of touch with the need to respond to the crisis on everyone's mind. President Obama: The BP oil spill has hardened negative perceptions of President Obama's leadership style, playing into the flipside of ""No Drama Obama"" -- namely that the president is so analytical as to seem aloof. It has highlighted questions raised during the campaign about his readiness to take the ""3 a.m. call"" and provided evidence of why we've only elected three people without executive experience to the presidency over the past century: Warren G. Harding, John F. Kennedy and Obama. Comparisons to President Carter are overdone -- a reflexive attack by the right against any Democratic president. But the tick-tock of each day that passes has been compared to the Iranian hostage crisis in that they seem to symbolize an impotence of government. When the president of Plaquemines Parish, Billy Nungesser, told a Senate subcommittee, ""I still don't know who's in charge. ... Is it BP? Is it the Coast Guard? ... I have spent more time fighting the officials of BP and the Coast Guard than fighting the oil."" It was a scathing condemnation of a lack of leadership. And when Nungesser said he wanted someone ""with the guts and the will to make decisions"" -- well, that's what we elect presidents for. There is still time to turn this around -- the $20 billion escrow account was a step in the right direction -- but for the Obama administration, it's later than they think. 'Drill baby, drill': Rarely has a political slogan ever sounded more stupid in retrospect. It was the frat-boy approach to energy policy -- pump now, think later. But Saturday night has turned into Sunday morning and we're forced to confront the consequences. The chant not only took over the Republican convention, it started to change the country's policy mindset. Gallup polls showed that by April 2010, over 50 percent of Americans said the United States should ""prioritize the development of energy supplies over environmental protection"" for the first time in the 10 years the question had been asked. One month later, with the oil spill spewing, the poll switched, with 55 percent putting the environment over energy. The right response isn't to choose between the two but to refocus on the larger goal of getting ourselves off our addiction to foreign oil, responsibly increasing domestic supply while transitioning to renewable fuels and a green technology economy. In the bigger picture, populist anger at both big business and big government is likely to continue through the fall, with BP and a faltering government response the newest targets of frustration. It will remain a tough time for any candidate representing the establishment. But the old hyper-partisan slogans which sustained many protesters last year have slammed up against a new demand from the public: Stop fighting and just fix it.

"(CNN) -- Move over Disney -- a Nigerian animator has produced an educational cartoon to teach youngsters about African culture. Tired of African children watching only imported cartoons that didn't reflect their lives, Nigerian animator Adamu Waziri decided to do something about it. His creation is ""Bino and Fino,"" a cartoon aimed at three to five year olds, about a brother and sister who live with their grandparents in an unnamed African city. ""I want to create a brand that's as good as Dora the Explorer, Charlie and Lola, quality wise, made in Nigeria, that is educational, and also shows positive aspects of Nigerian/African culture, not just to Nigerian or African kids but to kids everywhere,"" says Waziri. The pilot episode celebrated Nigeria's Independence Day and looked at the issue of colonialism. The cartoon has also had segments teaching the numbers one to 10 in the Nigerian Igbo and Yoruba languages. He adds that he wants the program to ""teach kids and show that the stuff you see on TV of starving people isn't the only thing (in Africa) -- you have a middle class here who have the same aspirations as everybody else."" See also: Meet the Afropolitans . Bino and Fino isn't the only children's cartoon produced in Africa. ""Tinga Tinga Tales,"" for example, is made in Kenya for the BBC, while ""Jungle Beat"" is produced in South Africa and has been shown internationally. But both cartoons, like many set in Africa, tell stories about the continent's exotic animals. Waziri was determined to do something different. ""I said I'm not going do African folk tales, animals -- that's what you get in (animated movie) 'Madagascar' -- we don't want to do that,"" he says. ""We want to show a couple of kids in a middle class life, which I know isn't the reality of all the kids in Africa, but let's show that reality -- the reality of people using laptops, phones, going to school, doing their daily business -- no talking ants, no dancing 'jinga jinga' music -- just a cartoon of life."" Two full-length ""Bino and Fino"" episodes have been shown on a channel on Sky TV in the UK, where Waziri says it has been well received. The next step is to attract the funding and sponsors needed to get the cartoon aired in Nigeria. It takes Waziri and his core team of four a month and a half to produce a single episode of Bino and Fino, which is just eight minutes of animation. His says the slow turnaround is off-putting for sponsors in Nigeria, where feature-length Nollywood movies are often produced in a matter of weeks. See also: Nigerian blockbusters for internet generation . Waziri adds that when it comes to entertainment, some Nigerians have a mindset of ""West is best,"" but he is determined to change people's minds by showing it's possible to make a credible homegrown alternative to imported programs. He believes that it's not enough for Africans to complain of being underrepresented in foreign cartoons, or misrepresented by international media -- they must also do something about it. ""People complain that Africa is not represented well in the media,"" says Waziri. ""I understand that, but my point is Nigeria and other parts of Africa aren't poor, you have businessmen, the infrastructure, the ability to link up and make studios, finance it and sponsor it and make the market -- stop waiting for Disney to do it, do it yourself.""","Nigerian cartoon ""Bino and Fino"" aims to teach children about African history and culture .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate voted Thursday to kill a controversial proposal pushed by Republicans that would have allowed employers to opt out of providing health care coverage they disagree with on moral grounds. By a 51-48 mostly party line vote, the motion by Democrats to table the amendment succeeded, effectively killing it. Three Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the tabling motion, while one Republican -- retiring moderate Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine -- voted with Democrats in favor. The so-called ""conscience"" amendment, sponsored by Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, was the Senate Republicans' response to the simmering controversy over a recent Obama administration decision to mandate the kind of health care coverage provided by religious employers. ""This bill would just simply say that those health care providers don't have to follow that mandate if it violates their faith principles,"" stated an early February press release from Blunt. ""This is about the First Amendment. It's about religious beliefs. It's not about any one issue."" The specific potential impact of the amendment was a matter of debate. On his website, Blunt rejected complaints that it would have allowed anyone to deny coverage of anything for any reason. However, Senate Democrats insisted it would provide too much latitude for employers to impose their personal beliefs on the healthcare issues of their workers. ""It would simply give every boss in America the right to make health care decisions for their workers and their families,"" argued Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington. She and other Democrats said that under the amendment, employers could have cited moral objections to cutting off coverage of immunizations, prenatal care for children of unmarried parents and other standard procedures. The American Civil Liberties Union applauded the Senate vote. ""The Blunt Amendment and its supporters are out of touch with reality,"" said Sarah Lipton-Lubet, the ACLU policy counsel. ""Overwhelmingly, women from every religious background use contraception to protect their health and plan their families and lives. The Senate did the right thing by American women today."" While Blunt's amendment took a broad approach, the main issue involved whether religious employers should have to include coverage for contraception in health plans offered to employees at affiliated institutions, such as hospitals. Earlier this month, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius issued a directive that would have required all employers, including religious organizations, to include such coverage in health insurance offered to their employees. While churches were exempt, the mandate covered religious affiliated institutions. Representatives from many faiths opposed the decision, calling it a violation of their religious conscience. In response to the uproar, the White House backed off the directive and instead said that religious employers could opt out of offering coverage for birth control, but insurance companies would have to offer such coverage separately and at no charge. Some critics say the White House's changed position does not go far enough. Blunt's amendment stated the president's health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, imposes requirements that infringe on the rights and conscience of insurers and plan sponsors. While the law exempts some religious groups, it does not allow all those with religious or moral objections to decline providing coverage, the amendment says. Part of the uproar surrounded universities and hospitals affiliated with religions, which were not given the same exemptions as churches and other religious institutions. The Blunt amendment would have established that an entity refusing coverage on religious or moral grounds is not in violation of the law. It did not mention contraception specifically and included health insurance companies . To get a vote on the Blunt amendment, it was tacked onto a $109 billion transportation bill, raising complaints from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, that the proposal was not germane to the legislation. Because of the dispute, action stalled on the transportation bill, which is backed by both parties. Reid said Tuesday that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, insisted on a floor vote on the Blunt amendment ""before we can move ahead with this jobs bill."" ""Once we have put this extreme and distracting proposal behind us, I hope my Republican colleagues will stop living in the past and join us this year, 2012, and help us create jobs,"" Reid said. Blunt welcomed the vote by tweeting, ""Glad Sen. Reid is going to allow a vote on my bipartisan admt to protect religious freedom this Thursday. #HHSMandate."" Voting on the amendment forced senators to take a stand on the controversial contraception decision. Though many Republicans have come out in support of the measure, Snowe told MSNBC the amendment is ""much broader than I could support."" Not all Democrats were united against the amendment, however. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, issued a statement Wednesday saying he would support it. ""I am voting in favor of this measure to protect the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America,"" Manchin said in a statement. A CNN/ORC International poll earlier this month showed a partisan divide on the issue, with 70% of Democrats agreeing with the Obama administration policy while 85% of Republicans opposed it. Independents were statistically split. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","The ACLU hails the Senate vote .

"Dresden, Germany (CNN) -- To understand the full beauty of the ancient Mediterranean city of Rome you have to come to wintry, cold Germany. In the east German city of Dresden, artist Yadegar Asisi has designed a panoramic scene of epic proportions, breathing life into a long-forgotten view of the Italian capital. Using a detailed and much-praised painting by Alexander von Wagner and Josef BÃ¼hlmann from 1886 as his inspiration, Asisi painted a first draft of Rome's cityscape in 1994. Nearly 17 years later, an even more impressive version has gone on display; it will remain in Dresden only until September -- a deliberate decision by the artist. ""To me art is a constant process. I always want to improve my panoramic scenes,"" Asisi told CNN. His 360 degree view of Rome in 312 AD is 27 meters high, 107 meters long and weighs 750 kilograms -- making it one of the world's largest panoramic scenes. Visitors overlook the city from a 15 meter high metallic tower located in the center of the perfectly circular museum: Standing on top of the tower, viewers feel they are part of Rome -- though sadly unable to wander down the stairs and walk to the Colosseum. Asisi chose as his subject a historical moment, the influence of which is still felt in Europe and around the world today: The triumphal procession of the Emperor Constantine the Great on October 29, 312. Constantine's brutal success over his rivals marked the beginning of the Christian West. At that time Rome was vital to Europe, and the days when many of its magnificent buildings would lie in ruins were a long way off. ""Moments that have shaped our world have a huge impact on my art"", said Asisi, sitting in his large Berlin studio, its walls filled with his paintings and photographs of ancient buildings or old reliefs. ""But this panoramic scene is not really about showing a cityscape, it is more about the stories hidden within the city,"" Asisi said. The panorama is a museum that needs no words to tell its stories. An art form dating back to 19th century Europe, panoramas fell out of fashion with the coming of the cinema. But why are people so fascinated? ""It seems Asisi's artistically and archaeologically-underpinned reconstruction of an ancient cityscape fills a large audience with enthusiasm for panoramic scenes and classical antiquity even today,"" said Andreas Scholl, director of Berlin's antiquities collection. Asisi has created a second historic panorama showing the ancient Greek city of Pergamon (today located in Turkey), which is currently on show at Scholl's Pergamonmuseum, on the Museum Island in Berlin. Asisi has been working on super-sized 360 degree panoramas since 1994. It takes him at least a year to design a single work, with previous subjects including Mount Everest and rainforests. ""Over the years the way panoramas were made has changed dramatically. I love to design on the computer as well as painting in the traditional way"", Asisi said. Today music samples, lighting and special effects are used to increase the impact of the panoramas, which change throughout the day, allowing visitors to see them by daylight or night. Asisi has formed a symbiotic relationship between science and art: To him research is as important as artistic know-how. ""I don't know whether my work is art or science. Probably it is both: Art starts where science stops,"" he said. His passion for details has taken him to Rome countless times -- and visitors' reactions suggest all that study has been worth the effort. ""This panorama is fascinating,"" said Rene Gust, 32, from Berlin. ""I have read about the beautiful Roman buildings lots of times before. But only now I understand why."" ""It is amazing to see how they go out of the museum,"" Asisi said. ""Lots of them are touched by the painting. ""I hope that the emotional connection between the panorama and the visitor will change their relationship with their environment."" Having grown up in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) some of his art focuses on social issues. He is planning a panorama of the Berlin Wall, but says that rather than examining the cruelties of the GDR regime, it will instead focus on a normal day in the once-split Berlin. ""To me it is extremely interesting why so many people in the former GDR did accept to live in such a country,"" he said. ""Many people - including me."" Meanwhile his panoramas are exciting more and more interest overseas. In 2003, Asisi drew a panorama for Daniel Libeskind which showed the architect's plans for the Ground Zero site in New York. Libeskind won the tendering process, and his design is currently under construction. It was Asisi's first panorama to not only fake reality - but create it. ""And there is much more to come,"" Asisi said. Yadegar Asisi's Rome 312: Experience the Ancient Metropolis is on display in Dresden until September 2, 2012. Pergamon: Panorama of the Ancient Metropolis is on view in Berlin until September 30, 2012.","German artist Yadegar Asisi specializes in super-sized panorama paintings .

"(CNN) -- Senegal's octogenarian incumbent president is seeking a third term Sunday, a bid that has sparked deadly protests and threatened the nation's reputation as one of the most stable democracies in Africa. The incumbent . Abdoulaye Wade, 85, came to power in 2000 after multiple unsuccessful runs. One of the continent's oldest leaders, the French-trained lawyer also has a degree in economics. He is seeking a third term against a crowded field of 13 others, including two women. He was initially credited with boosting the nation's infrastructure, but his critics have accused him of autocracy and said he is grooming his son to take over after him. Others have accused the leader of grandiose investments, including a costly towering monument near the capital of Dakar that sparked criticism in a country where poverty is still rife. Other contenders include Ousmane Tanor Dieng, Moustapha Niasse and Macky Sall, the latter of whom considered Wade a mentor. Why are protesters against his run? Senegalese protesters have taken to the streets nationwide since Wade won a court bid to run for a third term despite a constitutional limit mandating two terms. Wade successfully argued that he is exempt because he took office before the term limit was put in place. Wade is among a list of elderly leaders clinging to power in sub-Saharan Africa despite demands for them to step down. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe used his recent 88th birthday to lash out at critics and vowed to run for re-election. The opposition has said it will protest if Wade wins, but analysts say a lack of cohesion among foes and a system that favors the incumbent make it harder to unseat Wade, who is nicknamed the ""hare"" for his shrewd politics. ""Opposition in Senegal is weak due to a lack of interest, resolve and an unfair political and electoral system that's hell bent on guaranteeing Wade's presidency,"" said Ayo Johnson, an analyst on Africa. Who is behind the protests? Grammy-award winning Senegalese musician Youssou N'Dour is one of the forces behind the demonstrations. Last month, the constitutional court barred the singer from running for president, sparking more outrage on the streets. The court said he did not have enough signatures for his application to be valid, which he denies. Other leaders, entertainers and groups have joined the movement to block Wade's bid for a third term. An opposition coalition dubbed M23 has galvanized the protests and maintained the momentum as opposition candidates resumed campaigning. The June 23 Movement, or M23, is named after the date of a major protest last year against a constitutional amendment that would almost guarantee Wade victory. Why is Senegal considered a stable democracy? Senegal gained independence from France in 1960, and is one of the few nations in West Africa that has not had a coup. Past elections have included a smooth transition of power, a rarity in a continent with a history of election chaos, civil wars and coups. Its democracy is rooted in history -- even as a French colony, Senegal had representatives in parliament. ""Elections in Senegal have previously been peaceful,"" Johnson said. ""Currently, there is a lot of tension, anxiety, and protesters are already having running battles with police forces loyal to Wade. This would have been previously unthinkable."" The Senegalese are becoming ""more daring and resolute"" in their quest to oust Wade, the analyst said. Is Wade headed for re-election? Analysts say a divided opposition vote makes it easier for him to coast through. ""There are 13 presidential candidates with different ideologies and political differences ... making it easy for Wade to streak through a third term,"" Johnson said. ""However, if voting goes to a second round, a weakened Wade will find it difficult to win."" Wade would have stiff competition if parties consolidate their vote and rally against one candidate, he said. Conflict in the south also an issue . Despite its badge of honor as a stable democracy, a decades-long separatist rebellion in the southern region of Casamance remains unresolved. The government and rebel leaders have signed a peace accord in the past, and Wade promised to end the conflict when he took over, but the simmering tensions have blemished the nation's reputation.","Protests as Senegal's octogenarian incumbent president seeks third term .

"(CNN) -- Neptune Collonges has become the first grey to win the Grand National, England's most iconic horse race, since 1961. Trained by Paul Nicholls and ridden by Daryl Jacobs, the 11-year-old won by a nostril from the Jonjo O'Neill-trained Sunnyhill Boy. It is the first Grand National win for legendary trainer Nicholls, who has trained 52 previous runners without success. In third place was Seabass, ridden by Katie Walsh, who recorded the highest-placed finish by a female jockey in the history of the race. The Grand National is one of the most recognizable events in the English sporting calendar which takes place annually at the Aintree Racecourse in Liverpool. The four-and-a-half mile course features 30 flights of jumps, some as large as five-feet high, including the notorious Chair and Becher's Brook fences. The 2012 race got off to an inauspicious start after the Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Synchronised was spooked on his way down to the start and unseated his jockey, AP McCoy. McCoy eventually remounted and started the race, but Synchronised - who was bidding to become the first horse since Golden Miller in 1934 to win the Gold Cup and the Grand National in the same season -- fell at the sixth fence and subsequently had to be put down. The race was also marred by the death of another horse, According to Pete. Aintree's managing director, Julian Thick said every effort is always made to make the event safe for everyone involved. ""Since last year's race we have made further significant changes to the course and there have been four races run over the course without serious incident since then,"" Thick said. ""After today, we will, as always, be looking at all aspects of this year's race to see how we can improve safety further,"" he added. Earlier in the afternoon another veteran jockey, Ruby Walsh, suffered a fall in the Aintree Hurdle, ruling him out of the Grand National, where he had been due to ride On My Own. The ride was taken by Paul Townend, although they, too, failed to finish. But the Walsh family was still well-represented in the race, with the third-placed Seabass ridden by Ruby's sister Katie and trained by their father Ted.","Neptune Collonges wins the Grand National, one of UK's most famous horse races .

"Seoul (CNN) -- Waiting more than 60 years for an official apology has taken its toll on Kim Bok-dong. The 87-year old says she is tired and her health is failing but she continues to fight for recognition from the Japanese government for being used as a sex slave by their military during World War II. There were believed to be around 200,000 so-called ""comfort women,"" mostly Korean. Many have since passed away, but those still alive want individual compensation for their treatment. ""When I started, the Japanese military would often beat me because I wasn't submissive,"" Kim says. 'Comfort women' mark 1,000th rally . ""Every Sunday, soldiers came to the brothel from 8am until 5pm, on Saturday from noon until 5pm, plus weekdays. It was very hard to handle. I couldn't stand at the end of the weekend. Since I had to deal with too many soldiers, I was physically broken."" Kim has tears in her eyes as she talks of her ordeal -- an ordeal that lasted every single day for eight years. Kim describes being moved around half a dozen Asian countries from the age of 14. ""I was born as a woman but have never had a woman's life. I was dragged to the foreign army's battles, and my entire life was ruined."" Kim's first marriage broke down when she couldn't have children, which she assumes due to her mistreatment. When her second husband and her mother died, she had to work in the fields to earn a living. Kim is part of an NGO called the ""Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan,"" which is fighting for an apology. A weekly protest has been held outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul for the past 20 years. The embassy keeps its blinds shut during the protests and does not comment. Some Japanese prime ministers have personally apologized in the past, but the NGO director believes that it's not nearly enough. ""Anyone can verbally apologize. But this is not an issue that can be resolved by saying sorry,"" says Yoon Mee-Hyang. ""This is a crime that was institutionalized by a country, they forced women into sexual slavery over a long period of time. They need to adopt a resolution at the official level and we need to see legal reparations."" Yoon is planning to travel to Japan to meet with government officials. Tokyo maintains its legal liability for the wrongdoing was cleared by a bilateral claims treaty signed in 1965 between the two countries. The South Korean government has stepped up diplomatic pressure recently, but only after a Korean court ruled in August that it was unconstitutional for the government not to help. Attempts by President Lee Myung-bak to discuss the issue with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda have so far yielded no results. The issue of comfort women continues to haunt relations between the two countries. But for the few comfort women still alive -- only 63 are now registered in South Korea -- it's an urgent issue that they can't afford to wait for.","About 200,000 ""comfort women"" were believed to have been forced into sexual slavery .

"(CNN) -- Former Rutgers University student Dharun Ravi apparently tried to make amends with his estranged roommate Tyler Clementi after allegedly using a webcam to spy on Clementi's sexual encounter with another man, according to text messages revealed in court Wednesday. Clementi committed suicide soon after the texts were sent. It is not clear if Clementi ever received the messages. ""I've known you were gay and I have no problem with it,"" read messages sent by Ravi, according to authorities. Ravi apparently sent the messages after he learned that Clementi had requested a room change. They were sent September 22, 2010, the same night Clementi took his own life by leaping from the George Washington Bridge, which spans the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey. Prosecutors have said Ravi and another student placed the camera in the dormitory room without Clementi's knowledge to spy and humiliate him because he was gay. Ravi's lawyer, Steve Altman, has said his client had switched on the webcam to monitor his personal items because he did not trust his roommate's visitor. The man who Clementi was intimate with, identified only as M.B., testified last week that after one encounter he ""could hear people talking in the courtyard. People joking, people laughing."" Ravi, 20, now faces a 15-count indictment in Clementi's death that includes charges of bias intimidation, invasion of privacy, tampering with physical evidence, witness tampering and hindering apprehension or prosecution. His trial began last Friday. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison. Last year, he turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time. Less than a month after Clementi's suicide, President Obama released a videotaped message condemning bullying.","Dharun Ravi apparently tried to make up with roommate, according to text messages .

"MEDELLIN, Colombia (CNN) -- This city's drug underworld is littered with ""poseurs"" -- lowlife triggermen pretending they're the real hard cases. Samir Romero, wanted by police for two murders, was killed in  August. He was shot 13 times. But a longstanding and trusted source, with intimate knowledge of Medellin's violent subculture, assured me the two men I was about to meet were the real deal. My destination: a single-story home in the city's notorious ""Commune 13"" district where I had set up a meeting with two hit men, who have for years hired their lethal services out to the cocaine cartels. Inside the house, a man called ""Red"" sat on a couch toying a fully loaded 9mm Ruger pistol. ""This will stop somebody nicely,"" he said, as I glanced at it. His face and arms were covered in burn marks. He said it was a testament of the day a barrel of acid spilled onto him as he was working in a clandestine cocaine processing lab in northern Colombia. Red explained that after the accident, the lab foreman tossed him out, half-dead, into a jungle clearing. What little strength he had left, he said he used to bat away vultures. And, against the odds, he made his way to safety and slowly recovered. When Red left the clinic months later, he said he went straight back to the drug lab and gunned down the foreman and three of his henchmen. That wasn't his first killing though, he told me. When he was just 11 years old, Red recounted, he took a razor to the throat of a neighborhood drug pusher who had been molesting his little sister. The other man, ""C"", sat quietly as I listened to Red. Like Red, my source told me, ""C"" was also the so-called ""chief"" of a number of neighborhoods -- running local drug-peddling operations, extortion rackets and organizing hits for a big cartel boss he simply referred to as ""El Cucho,"" or ""The Old Man."" It was a hot morning and he was shirtless. His chest was branded with a tattoo of the Virgin Maria Auxilatrix, known in Colombia as the ""Virgin of the Assassins."" Hitmen, or ""sicarios"" as they call them here, revere her and pray to her for protection against arrest or death and for help to carry out their killings.  Watch as Medellin law enforcement moves from killing to killing » . During our time with the hit men they offered a fascinating insight into their violent world -- from how much they get paid to what their mothers think of their lifestyle: . Penhaul: Why are Medellin's drug bosses and the street gangs in a war right now? ""RED"": ""These problems come about because they're looking for a good man to run things. We have to find him and, in order to find him, what's happening right now has to run its course."" ""C"": ""Medellin has exploded right now because different groups want to control it and earn money and gain territory. The authorities locked up, extradited, or cut cooperation deals with the big guys, the ones who controlled all this. Those were the ones people respected. Now there's no respect and anybody who has a bunch of money is grabbing a few kids from a poor neighborhood and putting them to work.""  Penhaul: What are the cartel bosses paying for a contract killing now? ""C"": ""If you're talking about a contract hit then right now you can get four or five million pesos (between US$2,000 and $2,500) to kill some idiot slimeball. Then of course there are bigger hits where you can earn 15 (million) or 20 million (between $7,500 and $10,000). Some of those hits pay pretty well. There's a lot of people around here with a lot of money and they're using it for bad things. Sometimes even the politicians will pay for a hit to get somebody out of their way."" Penhaul: Why did you get into this lifestyle? ""Red"": ""People need to eat and there's a lot of hunger. We don't just want the crumbs. That's the big problem. There's a lot of idle hands around here and many people think they have a chance if they have a gun in their hand."" ""C"": ""I grew up in a slum and every time I stepped outside the door there were guys from the local gang smoking (marijuana) joints. They had guns, the best motorbikes and money so I started running errands for them."" Penhaul: Didn't you have any big dreams when you were kids? ""Red"": ""I always said when I grow up I would build a house for my old lady with a cement roof and plaster and paint on the walls. I dreamed I'd be able to give her money to go to the supermarket every week."" ""C"": ""I dreamed of being a professional soccer player. I was pretty good. But I never got the chance."" Penhaul: Do you think you've made your mothers proud by killing people? ""Red"": ""I once gave my mum a wad of cash after I did a job. She took the wad and slapped me in the face and told me not to bring that cursed money into the house. She begged me to get out of that life. She was afraid they would kill me."" ""C"": ""My mum knows nothing about this. I guess she imagines because she tells me to take care otherwise I'll wind up dead. But she doesn't know for sure."" Penhaul: What did your first contract hit feel like? ""Red"": ""You kill the first one and you panic for a few days. You're nervous. But then you kill the second one and that's a kind of a medicine. It takes the pain away that you were feeling after the first killing."" ""C"": ""The first time is really f***ed up. I nearly went mad. You see a cop and think he's going to arrest you. I was 16 or 17. That was my first time. I hardly even wanted to eat. But then you carry on and kill this one and that one. You earn money. After I killed somebody the first time I bought my first decent pair of sneakers. ""It's not so tough now. Sometimes you kill somebody and you know they were going to kill you. It's not a question of conscience. It's a question of kill or be killed."" Penhaul: Don't you feel any remorse? ""C"": You know you messed up when you go to the wake and see people crying and you know it's your fault. But I don't back down from a killing because I know if somebody comes after me they won't back down."" ""Red"": ""I've got feelings and sometimes you sit down and think what a shame. But the person who's trying to shoot you isn't going to think the same. You're not killing somebody for the fun of it. If you don't mark your territory then you're a nobody."" Penhaul: So, apart from the money, why do you do it? ""C"": ""To gain respect round here you have to be a mother f***er. You've got to be a bastard so people respect you. If you're quiet and respectful everybody takes advantage. But if they know you're a mother f***er who'll bust their ass at the first sign of trouble then they respect you and your family."" Penhaul: Are you killing innocent people? ""C"": ""I never kill somebody who doesn't deserve it. Sometimes I'll hunt down a ""patient"" for a week just so that I don't make any mistakes. You can't go and kill somebody just because you want to. You have to ask for permission from the big guys who control us. You explain to the ""old man"" and he gives the final word."" Penhaul: Are you ever on the receiving end of bullets? ""Red"": ""They once shot me four times at point blank range. I heard them laughing as they walked away and one came back and kicked me in the head for good measure. When I got better he was the first one I killed. I've been shot 17 times. Well let's call it 19 if you count the ones that just graze you. They say some bodies have divine protection. Let's hope mine is one of them."" Penhaul: Why don't normal citizens just turn you in? Because they're afraid? ""C"": ""The community collaborates with us. We give them food parcels and we throw parties for them and give toys to the kids. We don't mistreat everybody, just the ones who deserve it. We don't kill innocent people."" Penhaul: Do you want to get out of this life? ""C"": ""I know you should pay what you owe. But I don't want to pay for all those deaths. I'll be absolutely f***ed if I have to pay. I want to get out of this but I want a clean slate. If I pay my debt to the law then that means jail and if I pay on the street then that means death. I don't want to go to jail or to die."" Penhaul: Do you see any quick end to the current cartel violence in Medellin? ""C"": ""We've survived one war, then another and now this one. I can't see it all ending. I don't think that will happen. If you kill two or three people there's four or five more behind him who want to kill you.""","Colombian hitmen talk about their careers to CNN .

"(CNN) -- The body of a journalist who was hacked to death in southeastern Nepal was cremated Tuesday as businesses and public transportation in the town of Janakpur remained shut for a second day to protest the killing. Uma Singh, who was murdered in Nepal Sunday, had talked about the difficulties of practicing journalism. Authorities said they arrested four people in connection with the death of Uma Singh, but they did not release the suspects' names or possible motive, said Damakant Jayashi, associate editor of the online news Web site, myrepublica.com. ""Journalists and human rights groups have descended on the town, and shops are shuttered in what almost seems like a spontaneous protest,"" Jayashi said. ""Journalists are all wearing black bands on their arms. And the FM stations in the city, all day yesterday, they played mourning tunes instead of their regular programs."" The killing of Singh, 26, is the latest in a ""troubling trend"" of attacks on reporters, the United Nations' human rights office in the country said. It asked the government to investigate the case and prosecute death threats against other journalists. ""Doing so will send a strong message that there will be no impunity for attacks against the media, nor for any serious crimes,"" the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal said. Singh wrote for a daily newspaper and reported for a radio station in Janakpur, about 240 km (150 miles) southeast of the capital city, Kathmandu. When she got home from work Sunday night, a group of about 15 men barged into the room she rented at a house and hacked her with ""khukhuris"" -- curved knives traditional to Nepal -- in full view of other boarders, authorities said. ""I am very very shocked,"" said Dharmendra Jha, president of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists, which is leading the protests. ""If the government is not ready to provide any kind of security to journalists, it will be very difficult to do journalism in a free mode."" The group said it will announce a new phase of protests Wednesday. Authorities do not have a motive for the killing. In some of her articles, Singh spoke out against the dowry system, where a bride's family is forced to give cash and property to the groom's family before the wedding. Also Sunday, a group of men ransacked the house of another journalist in the same region, leaving a cross on her door and telling her it was her turn next, media groups said. Police do not know if the two incidents are related. In recent months, the number of attacks on journalists in Nepal have shot up. The federation released a year-end report, recording 284 incidents -- including three deaths and a kidnapping. Some of the assailants have ties to the Communist Party of Nepal, the largest party in Nepal's coalition government, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch. The party is led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, or Prachanda -- a man who led a decade-long bloody insurgency before being sown in as prime minister. During the decade-long civil war, Maoist forces under him carried out numerous attacks on journalists they believed were opposed to their cause, Human Rights Watch said. And after he became prime minister, Prachanda issued a public warning to journalists while addressing a massive crowd in Kathmandu: ""Now we will no longer tolerate criticism as we have already been elected by the people."" Three years ago, Singh's father and elder brother disappeared. Her family has all along accused local Maoist leaders of being behind the disappearances, Jayashi said. Singh, herself, talked about the difficulties of practicing journalism in an interview with the United Nations last year. ""Various armed groups that are mushrooming have been a major challenge for us. We have been compelled to dance to their tunes. ...This makes us helpless,"" she said in the interview. ""What do we do? If we don't air the news of their choice, they threaten to kill us. Things have become very, very difficult for us.""","Nepalese journalist who reported on women's rights hacked to death Sunday .

"(CNN) -- David Zyla remembers when he was 5 years old and his parents were getting ready for a dinner party. He spied his mother reaching for a necklace, and he recommended that she wear a different one. Then he turned to his father and boldly suggested he wear a different tie with his shirt -- and not be afraid to mix patterns. ""That was the moment,"" Zyla said. ""I think I was instinctively choosing things that suited them more. I've always felt there was an appropriateness for each person."" It is no surprise that Zyla followed his passion to New York University to study costume design, then pursued a career in fashion. For a new season of warm-weather fashion trends, the Emmy-winning stylist is sharing his ""Style DNA"" philosophy that has aided his celebrity clients. In Zyla's eyes, not only is each person unique in their appearance, but they have ""true colors"" that are inherent, and indicative of their personality and style -- found in a person's eyes, hair and skin tones. The stylist also offers help in his book, ""The Color of Style,"" which came out in paperback last year. Zyla sat down with CNN for an interview last week to talk about spring and summer fashions, how to wear them in your own way and why everyone should embrace their true colors. The following is a transcript edited for length and clarity. CNN: What is your style philosophy? Zyla: If you think about it like this, you are the subject of a great painting and what you chose to fill in around you illuminates you, or it can make you recede. I feel there has been a lot of mystery around what looks good on people. My goal with all of this is I really believe that everyone has the right to look and feel fantastic. Everyone loves compliments, especially the compliment ""You look great,"" as opposed to ""Great fill-in-the-brand-name-skirt-here."" Color is not that much of a commodity -- it's attainable and the perfect way to express who we are. Your clothes and color should be used as raw materials to illustrate you -- you are the focal point. Your skin tone is your skin tone, you can either embrace it and illuminate it, or you can distract from it. Your skin, eyes and hair exist as givens, then you fill in the rest around it. It's very important to be who we are, we're all so unique, and I really want to triumph the individual. CNN: What are those key looks for spring and summer? Zyla: One of the things I would say is an important piece is the draped skirt. If you never have worn a pencil skirt, and you know it's not your best, don't do a draped pencil skirt. But if you always wear a-line and feel great in it, do a draped a-line skirt if you want to update. Take the trends and customize them for you. Also, white is a huge thing right now, which every couple of years it comes back, and this year is a more diaphanous approach where you're layering and so on. Individualize it by choosing your white. If you never wear stark white, and you look better in ivory, wear ivory. You don't have to follow the trends to the runway level, you should follow them to the customized version of you level. The way to find your white is you should match the white of your eyes. Another big trend are baroque patterns -- big chains and medallion prints. These very large prints can be overpowering. A great rule of thumb is if the print repeat is bigger than your head, it's too large. If you are someone who feels much better in solids, do it in an accessory -- a scarf or handbag that has that print on it. CNN: Were there any designers whose styles you were particularly excited to see in the spring or summer collection? Zyla: There are several. Tracy Reese makes me excited every year. The fact that she creates the scale of the collection that she does every year and it has just enough theatricality to it to make the pieces stand out, yet they don't look like costumes. She really is a talented designer with the perfect mix -- the balance is fantastic. I also love the dress designer Jay Godfrey. His dresses for spring are completely up-to-the-minute exciting, and a variety of silhouettes. Nanette Lepore is very good, I'm loving what I'm seeing there. I really think it is a very exciting spring season. The reason I'm excited about the designers I'm mentioning is they aren't just connected to one thing, they are doing nice variety. CNN: How do you embrace your style amidst the changing seasons? Zyla: Dressing in layers is always a good idea and prepare for what you're going to do that way as well. Atlanta, San Francisco, there area a lot of cities like this where each particular day can be drastically different. Throw a sweater in your bag, dress with a layer that can come off and think ahead of time. The best thing to do is think about the fabric of your clothing. As beautiful as linen is, it's not going to last until lunch -- it's going to be a wrinkled mess. Cotton is going to breathe. Natural fabrics that have a little weight to them are always going to be your friend because they will last through the day. CNN: Because the styles are more open this season, are there any key pieces that a lot of people can wear? Zyla: One of the trends is very bright, neon, what I call hyper-Popsicle colors -- very, very vivid, and I would say that if you want to have that, take one of the colors the looks great on you, and do it in an unexpected piece, like a skirt or coat. A lot of times, we think of these vivid colors in accents or smaller things, I think this is the season to embrace the vividness. I'm not saying just because tangerine tango is the color of spring that everyone should wear it. If the brightest color on your palette is an American beauty rose pink, why don't you use that in an unexpected way? Wearing a color that doesn't suit you, you're not going to be comfortable. CNN: What do you address in your book, ""The Color of Style""? Zyla: I address the idea that we all have an authentic style and true colors. In the first part of the book, I lead you to finding these true colors and what is your dramatic, romantic and energy color, and they all do very different things. Some make you feel very friendly and approachable, some make you feel sexy. In the second part, I lead you to one of 24 archetypes -- I believe there are 24 archetypes of women. With each archetype, I give you fragrance ideas, style ideas, fabrics, artists that represent your type, the must-haves, the must-avoids, the super power and the kryptonite. It's a read on the personality as well and really how to put a palette and a wardrobe together. In part three of the book, I teach you how to utilize all of these tools in shopping and cleaning out your closet. When you shop, do it with intention. And I also lead you to how to dress for every occasion. I really want people to honor their true colors and honor who they are in their authentic style. Then, I want them to really love themselves and flourish with this material.","David Zyla writes in ""The Color of Style"" that individuals have ""true colors"" that suit them .

"(CNN) -- Family and friends of a well-known literary translator in Iran are concerned for his well-being after he was detained for unknown reasons nearly two weeks ago. Mohammad Soleimani Nia, 39, has been held since January 10, according to a source close to his family. The family doesn't know where he's being detained or why he's being questioned, but they fear he is in solitary confinement at Tehran's notorious Evin prison, according to the source. The prison is known for its harsh conditions. Soleimani Nia's family is ""so worried about his health,"" said the source, who did not want to be named for safety reasons. ""He's not a strong person physically."" His ordeal began in late November when he was questioned by security and intelligence officers. Friends and family aren't sure the motive behind that questioning as phones are monitored in Iran and Soleimani Nia was tight-lipped about the experience, which resulted in him being banned from leaving the country, according to the source. On January 10, officials called him to the Revolutionary Court, where he reported that morning. The court hears cases of smuggling, blaspheming, inciting violence or trying to overthrow the Iranian government. After arriving at court, he was accompanied by security guards to the home he shares with his parents in Karaj, outside Tehran. The guards searched the house, seizing electronic devices and documents, and prohibited Soleimani Nia from speaking to his parents, the source said. His whereabouts have been unknown since the guards left the home with Soleimani Nia in their custody. Firoozeh Dumas, an Iranian-American author whose best-selling book ""Funny in Farsi"" Soleimani Nia translated for the Iranian audience, described her friend as ""a very gentle soul."" ""He's a very innocent, very delicate man,"" Dumas said, adding, ""I don't think he would physically survive"" the harsh conditions of prison. The source close to the family offered a similar description: ""He's a gentle, polite person,"" comparing his manner of speaking to ""how poets and writers talk."" Both Dumas and the source were adamant in describing Soleimani Nia as someone who is not involved in Iran's politics, making the reason for his detainment even more of a puzzle. ""He made a point of distancing himself from politics,"" Dumas said. Soleimani Nia's mother has gone to court daily to arrange a supervised meeting with her son, the source said, but each day she is told that he is still being interrogated. The family has tried to obtain a lawyer for Soleimani Nia, but they've been advised that until he has been formally charged, they cannot take up his case, according to the source. In addition to his translating work, Soleimani Nia also runs a social media network in Iran called U24, similar to LinkedIn. The site has 60,000 members. ""He's basically somebody who likes to connect artists and he's never made any money -- he's somebody who is in it for the higher good,"" Dumas said. ""He's always pursued things that have really benefited the people of Iran."" Soleimani Nia's case is just one of thousands circulating through Iran's justice system -- many as a result of religious or political persecution. But unlike the recent high-profile cases of American hikers detained for more than two years or a former U.S. Marine sentenced to death for espionage, many of those detainees' stories are never made public. Iran's notoriously secretive trials have been assailed by human rights groups and governments around the globe. The U.S. State Department's annual human rights report on Iran says the court system is, in practice, ""corrupt and subject to political influence."" And while the country's constitution provides a defendant the right to a public trial, presumption of innocence, and a lawyer of his or her choice, ""These rights were not respected in practice."" For his family and friends, the lack of information is gut-wrenching. ""A man is in jail for no reason whatsoever and no one has heard from him,"" Dumas said, her voice breaking. ""It's a nightmare. This is this man's life and I think about his parents and I got physically sick when I heard the news."" CNN's Mitra Mobasherat contributed to this report.","Mohammad Soleimani Nia has been detained since January 10 for unknown reasons .

"(CNN) -- A Florida high school valedictorian and her sister, who were facing deportation, instead were meeting with with lawmakers Wednesday after being granted a reprieve. An immigration judge ruled last week that Daniela Pelaez, 18, and her sister Dayana were to be deported for being in the country illegally. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday gave the sisters a two-year reprieve. The decision was made under the policy of prosecutorial discretion, which is designed to prioritize deportation for illegal border crossers with a criminal record, instead of those who pose little or no risk. ""The agency exercises prosecutorial discretion, on a case by case basis, as necessary to focus resources on our stated priorities,"" ICE spokesman Nestor Yglesias said in a statement Wednesday. The Pelaez sisters traveled to Washington to meet with Florida Sens. Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson, and Florida Reps. David Rivera and Frederica Wilson. Rubio, a Republican, had expressed support for finding a way for Daniela Pelaez to remain in the United States. ""I have always said that our country needs to figure out a way to accommodate high academic achievers brought here at a very young age by their parents but who now find themselves undocumented through no fault of their own,"" he said in a statement last week. ""From what I've read in press accounts, the story of Daniela Pelaez is exactly the kind of case I have been talking about."" The sisters and their parents came from Colombia 14 years ago and never left -- overstaying their tourist visas. A Miami immigration judge ruled last week that the two girls must be deported to Colombia, leaving the teenagers in shock. Daniela, a high school senior, has a 6.7 grade point average and is at top of her class out of 823 students, a school administrator said. The teenager wants to study cellular and molecular biology for a medical career.","Two Florida sisters facing deportation get a two-year reprieve .

"(CNN) -- Australian authorities on Monday pleaded with hundreds of people who had chosen to remain in a town in the path of rising flood waters to vacate their homes. The level of the Balonne River in the town of St. George, in the eastern state of Queensland, swelled to 13.63 meters at lunchtime on Monday, breaking its previous record, and was expected to crest overnight above 14 meters. ""We can't and won't physically drag people out of their homes,"" Bob Atkinson, the Queensland police commissioner, said. ""But we repeat the request for people to leave their homes."" Queensland has been deluged with heavy rains over the past week even as some parts of the region are still struggling to recover from devastating floods that took place about a year ago. Thirty houses in St. George have already been inundated, according to Neil Roberts, the Queensland police and emergency services minister. ""We do expect this to rise as the waters head towards their peak,"" he said. The majority of St. George's roughly 3,000 residents have left the danger area, by both bus and aircraft, Roberts said. The authorities had already been using military helicopters and a C-130 cargo plane to airlift thousands of stranded Queensland residents to safety. Hundreds of people were taking shelter in evacuation centers Monday. Rescue workers on Sunday recovered the body of a woman who died trying to drive her pickup through flood waters, the authorities said. Jane Sheahan was swept away Friday in the town of Roma. Witnesses told CNN affiliate Nine Network that Sheahan managed to hand off her 7-year-old son, Darcy, to a would-be rescuer before she was swept away. The floods have already damaged hundreds of homes in Roma and another town, Mitchell, according to Roberts. In the neighboring state of New South Wales, thousands of people remained isolated Sunday despite reports of receding floodwaters in some areas.","The Balonne River in the town of St. George reaches record level and is expected to rise further .

"(CNN) -- A well-known Mexican actress who has played crime bosses on television says she trusts the purported head of the Sinaloa cartel more than government officials. ""Today I believe more in El Chapo Guzman than in the governments that hide the truth from me even though it is painful,"" actress Kate del Castillo said in a message linked to her Spanish-language Twitter account this week. Del Castillo starred as a drug trafficker in Telemundo's popular prime-time soap opera ""La Reina del Sur"" (""The Queen of the South"") and also played Mexican crime boss Pilar Zuazo on the Showtime series ""Weeds."" Her wide-ranging online post -- which outlines the movie star's beliefs on topics such as the goodness of the human race, the Roman Catholic Church and marriage -- came the same week that officials from the U.S. Department of the Treasury called Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman ""the world's most powerful drug trafficker."" Guzman, who is accused of running a major network that distributes cocaine and heroin, has been indicted by U.S. authorities in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. In 2004, the U.S. government announced a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction. Ghastly toll in 2011 Mexico drug violence: 13,000 killed .

"(CNN) -- It has been a relationship fraught with tension and disagreements, but with Valentine's Day around the corner, it appears Carlos Tevez and Manchester City might be prepared to kiss and make up. The Argentina striker has been frozen out of the first team picture at City since refusing to warm up as a substitute during a European Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich in Germany back in September. Tevez has since been hit with a massive fine and was widely expected to leave the English Premier League leaders in January, but a move failed to materialize despite interest from Italian giants AC and Inter Milan. City manager Roberto Mancini has now hinted he may be prepared to forgive Tevez, who captained the team to a first trophy in 35 years last season, in a bid to bolster the club's chances of clinching their first top division title since 1968. Man City return to top of English Premier League . Tevez also said he wanted to play for City again in an interview on Argentinian television but risked further tension by laying the blame for the argument at Mancini and City's doorstep. ""Everyone knows that Tevez is a top player and it probably would have been better for us if he'd been here,"" Mancini told a press conference prior to Sunday's 1-0 win away at Aston Villa, which saw them return to the top of the table. ""I don't have any problem and the club doesn't have any problem. Finish. It's up to him. Carlos knows everything, he knows the situation. ""I spoke with Carlos one week after Munich ... We are here. We've not changed these past few months and Carlos knows that. He is a City player."" But Mancini made it clear Tevez, who is reportedly due to return to Manchester from Argentina this week, would have to apologize before he would get the opportunity to add to the 43 goals he has scored for the club since joining in 2009. ""This is normal,"" the former Inter coach said. ""Then after Carlos can train, can play, as long as his condition is good. If he comes back, we are happy."" Liverpool's Suarez apologizes for Evra handshake snub . But in an interview with Fox Sports Latin America, Tevez rejected he was to blame for the breakdown in relations.

"(CNN) -- French international Franck Ribery scored both goals for Bayern Munich in their 2-0 win over Schalke, on Sunday, but the Bavarian giants remain four points behind Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund, who defeated Hanover 3-1. Ribery, who was angry to be substituted in Bayern's Champions League defeat by Basel in midweek, opened the scoring with a superb 36th-minute individual goal, deftly flicking the ball away from keeper Timo Hildebrand before rolling the ball into an empty net. And he sealed the points for the home side 10 minutes after the break, slotting the ball home after a one-two with Bayern teammate Thomas Muller. But, despite the victory, champions Dortmund are still the side in pole position in the German title race after they saw off Hanover in front of a remarkable crowd of over 80,000 supporters. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski was their match-winner, with a double strike of his own to give Dortmund a seventh straight win and sixth in the Bundesliga. The 23-year-old opened the scoring in the 27th minute and doubled his tally early in the second half from close range after being set up by compatriot Jakub Blaszczykowski. A superb long-range strike from Ivory Coast striker Didier Ya Konan, who spotted Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller well off his line, gave the visitors some hope. But subsitute Ivan Perisic secured the points for Dortmund with a decisive third goal in injury time. Meanwhile, in Italy's Serie A, in-form Napoli beat Inter Milan 1-0 to pile the pressure on Nerazzurri coach Claudio Ranieri after a seventh defeat in eight matches. Ezequiel Lavezzi's second-half strike settled the match at the San Paolo to lift Napoli to 40 points and fifth place while Inter remain in seventh on 36 points. Napoli, who beat Chelsea in midweek in the Champions League, could even play the last 12 minutes with 10 men after Salvatore Aronica's sending off. Ranieri told Italian television after the defeat that his future was in doubt. ""I don't know what the president (Massimo Moratti) will do now. This is a question for him. I would say Ranieri should continue. I still believe in these players,"" he said.","French international Franck Ribery scores twice as Bayern Munich defeat Schalke 2-0 .

"(CNN) -- A burst of intense rain caused perilous flash flooding Monday in parts of Louisiana, spurring the rescues of hundreds -- from people marooned inside their homes to middle school students stranded on a bus. According to the National Weather Service, southern Louisiana was pelted with an estimated 15 inches of rain in six hours, with on-and-off rain continuing for hours after that. ""I'm 46 years old, native to this area, and have been through several hurricanes, and I've never seen anything like this,"" said Lafayette Parish Sheriff's Office spokesman Kip Judice. Hours after the biggest pocket of rain hit, Judice said that 10 rescues were under way around 6:30 p.m. This is in addition to the more than 150 such operations that took place earlier to get people out of residences and cars. One of those involved 16 adolescents whose bus became stuck after more than 4 feet of water covered the road, said Judice. Boats and dump trucks were used to reach the children and bring them to safety. The town of Carencro was among the hardest hit communities in Lafayette Parish, according to Capt. Craig Stansbury, who is also from the Parish Sheriff's Office. He noted there were reports of water as high as 8 feet on some roadways. Stansbury said fire department vehicles, tractors and conventional boats and air boats were being used to reach those stranded in homes and cars. ""A lot of things that we have at our disposal, we're just going to go ahead and utilize,"" he said. ""Whatever it takes to get to the people."" One of the worst hit parts of the state was St. Landry Parish, where Government Administrative Director Jessie Bellard estimated 2,000 people had been affected so far. A state of emergency has been declared for the parish, though there are no known injuries or fatalities there or elsewhere. People were driving dump trucks to rescue residents who have flooding in their homes and can't get out. He said several minor and major roads, including part of U.S. Highway 190, have experienced significant flooding. ""It's just a terrible situation,"" said Bellard. Maj. Ginny Higgins of the St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office said at least 15 to 20 roads were affected by flooding Monday in that parish. Several people were safely rescued after being trapped in their vehicles, she said. A state of emergency has been declared for that parish, Higgins said. Stansbury, from Lafayette Parish, said residents knew Monday would be wet but didn't foresee the volume or intensity. ""There was a forecast of some heavy rains, but I don't think anybody could have predicted that amount of rain,"" he said. And while the worst precipitation is over, the headaches are not. Intermittent rain continued to fall Monday, with the National Weather Service issuing a flash flood warning for all or parts of the parishes of Allen, Evangeline, Acadia, Lafayette, St. Martin and St. Landry through 11:30 p.m. The agency called conditions ""dangerous ... with numerous roads and homes flooded."" Judice, from Lafayette Parish, said Monday evening that water levels were continuing to rise in his area. ""It's still a very crazy situation,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Coast Guard and Air National Guard crews spent a second day in search of four sailors from a yacht that ran aground off San Francisco over the weekend, the services said Sunday. At least one person died and three were rescued from the ""Low Speed Chase,"" Petty Officer 2nd Class Levi Read said. But the remaining four people aboard remained unaccounted for Sunday afternoon, and rescuers were searching a 15-by-30-mile patch of the Pacific Ocean in hopes of finding them alive. The 38-foot sailboat was taking part in a race around the Farallon Islands, 28 miles west of the Golden Gate Bridge. The vessel's skipper reported that the yacht was hit by a series of large waves that rolled it over, tossing several crew members overboard and running it aground, the Coast Guard said Sunday. The search effort included three helicopters, a C-130 transport and four Coast Guard vessels, including the cutters Aspen, Pike and Sockeye. The yacht was taking part in the Full Crew Farallon Race, a contest that dates to 1907, according to the San Francisco Yacht Club. In a statement on its website, the club said ""Low Speed Chase"" was one of its vessels and that it was awaiting news of the rescue effort. Late last month, the Coast Guard rescued racers taking part in an around-the-world contest when a giant wave damaged their yacht off the coast of San Francisco.

"(CNN) -- I was 23 and a graduate trainee journalist when Marie Colvin survived an ambush in Sri Lanka that robbed her of an eye. To me, she was already part of a small band of women war correspondents, starting with Martha Gellhorn, who were my role models. To me, these women lived the story, gave voice to the voiceless and urged the myopic world to sit up and give a damn. The romantic in me yearned for their life of exotic travel, dangerous liaisons and hushed confidences over drinks and cigarettes in dingy bars, where stories were written and lifelong friendships made. The realist in me did not understand the risks then. It wasn't until later that I realised I am not brave enough to be like Marie and some of the women I've met in my work. I've travelled to some dark places and reported from some danger zones, but nothing of the magnitude that she and they have encountered. I had first come across Marie while doing work experience on the foreign desk at the Sunday Times. To a young, hungry, aspiring foreign correspondent, she was an inspiration. But her experience in Sri Lanka several years later gave her added gravitas in my eyes. She was a survivor in a world where safety had not yet really become part of the culture and conversation in news rooms and, even then, in the years before the inexorable rise of social media raised the stakes and cacophony of information for traditional journalists, she was a rare breed. Having decided in the wake of the devastating earthquake in Haiti that I no longer wanted to report from these so-called hostile environments, that I no longer wished to do so as the mother of a small daughter, I now work for the International News Safety Institute, a charity that provides safety advice and training to journalists working in dangerous situations. At INSI, I've seen the risks journalists take and face across the world and I've learned about the people whose names and lives are hidden behind the statistics -- who represent the 120 or so men and women working in the news media killed every year trying to do their job. Unlike Marie, most of them aren't well-known journalists, reporting for famous newspapers. Most come from countries like Pakistan, the Philippines and Mexico, where ineffective governments and corrupt officials, businesspeople and gangs want to silence them. Along with Tim Hetherington and Anthony Shadid, Marie Colvin is probably the best known journalist to die whilst covering the Arab Spring. However, almost 30 more news media workers have died doing their jobs since the uprisings took root across the Middle East last year. With their unknown names and faces, they are unlike her. But like Marie, they are men and women who felt compelled to fight against injustice, armed only with their words and images. Marie knew that no war was risk free. And, after Sri Lanka, she knew that more than most. But she knew too that journalists have a responsibility in helping write that first rough draft of history. In a speech that's been much quoted in the past 24 hours, which she gave at a service in 2010 paying tribute to journalists killed in their work, she said: ""Our mission is to report these horrors of war with accuracy and without prejudice. We always have to ask ourselves whether the level of risk is worth the story. What is bravery, and what is bravado?"" There are many who turned back before Marie. Her mother said she wanted to finish ""one more story"". Her bosses urged her to leave the besieged Syrian city of Homs. One friend, the BBC's Jim Muir, says he sensed in her a vulnerability he'd not seen before in the days before she left for Syria. Shortly before she died, she told another friend, Channel 4 News' Lindsey Hilsum, that it was the ""worst they'd ever seen"". And, yet she felt compelled to continue shining a light on the worst suffering humans can inflict on each other, to give voice to the voiceless and expose the truth - in her case at a terrible price. Her death and that of the brilliant French photographer Remi Ochlick have highlighted risks that journalists take to do their jobs. It has shown that there still remains a rare breed of talented, humane journalist who believes it is worth risking everything to tell the story of the victims of war. At INSI, we want to pay tribute to Marie and the men and women like her. I hope her death will make the world sit up and realize what's going on in Syria and I hope her death will make people realize the risks that journalists across the world take every day to bring home the news. Marie Colvin remains for me a role model, the Martha Gellhorn of her generation: An extraordinary woman who combined grit and glamour. Women like her are rare in an industry long dominated by men. Often the risks they face are no different from their male counterparts. But, on many occasions they are. At INSI, we're launching a book dedicated to the safety of women journalists. In it, 40 women from around the world, including CNN's Hala Gorani, tell of covering war and civil unrest, corruption and disaster. They detail episodes of desperate detention, of kidnap, assault, extraordinary escapes and moments of awe-inspiring bravery, as they share their experiences of being a female journalist. The decision to put together this unique book was triggered by the terrible attack on Lara Logan in Tahrir Square last year. It went to print just days before Marie's death. ""No Woman's Land: On the Frontlines with Female Reporters"" will be published on March 8, International Women's Day. It will be launched with a tribute to Marie. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hannah Storm.","Former reporter Hannah Storm says Marie Colvin was an inspiration to journalists .

"London (CNN) -- The apologies issued by Luis Suarez and Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish on Sunday are a sign that the English club's American owners are finally stepping in to sort out a situation that has festered for too long, says a leading U.S. sports writer. ""This story got attention in the media in the U.S. -- The New York Times, The Boston Globe. These are papers (John Henry, Liverpool's principal owner) reads,"" Sports Illustrated's Grant Wahl told CNN's World Sport. The controversy started when Liverpool striker Suarez refused to shake hands with Manchester United's Patrice Evra before the start of an English Premier League match on Saturday. Suarez, a Uruguay international, was widely criticized for the snub. It came as they met face to face for the first time since he was given an eight-game ban for racial taunts directed at the Frenchman at an earlier fixture between the two clubs in October. United manager Alex Ferguson called Suarez a ""disgrace"" while Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre was angered by his own player's actions. Henry -- co-founder of Fenway Sports Group, which also owns baseball's Boston Red Sox -- hasn't said anything publicly yet. However, Wahl said the Sunday apologies were a result of the owners' intervention. The Merseyside club denied suggestions on Monday that the statements were prompted by the club's shirt sponsors Standard Chartered. Wahl remains surprised at how Liverpool have handled the affair from the outset. ""When we saw the lengthy suspension issued to Luis Suarez, the PR department from Liverpool issued one of the worst PR statements I've ever seen,"" Wahl said. Released in December last year, after the English Football Association handed down its eight-match ban and a Â£40,000 ($62,000) fine on Suarez, the Merseyside club said it was ""very surprised and disappointed"" with the decision. ""I think that gave Luis Suarez the feeling that he was in the right in this situation and that continued up into what we saw last weekend,"" Wahl said. He believes Liverpool should have just accepted the penalty and moved on. ""I'm surprised that the ownership group of Liverpool, which is well-versed in American sports, let this go on this long,"" Wahl said. ""My feeling is that maybe that's connected to the relationship between the previous American owners at Liverpool and the fans and club, and maybe not wanting to be seen as meddling,"" he said. ""But they should have meddled along time ago and start putting things in the right direction. This took far too long to happen."" Henry is scheduled to attend the final of the English League Cup when Liverpool take on second division Cardiff at Wembley Stadium on February 26, but some media reports have speculated that he will perhaps fly over earlier. Whether or not this turns out to be true, Wahl said Henry and the ownership group have always made one thing clear. ""Liverpool needs to be making its news on the field by winning and not with this other stuff.""","Sports Illustrated's Grant Wahl says Liverpool FC have handled Suarez saga very badly .

"(CNN) -- It seems that in recent years, Hollywood has been ""baby crazy,"" and celebrity followers have flocked to entertainment shows, websites and magazines with a voracious hunger to get the latest news on which stars are expecting a visit from the stork. Gossip columns relish in playing the ""Is she or isn't she?"" game. Magazines engage in fierce bidding wars to run the first photos of a new celebrity baby. Celeb kids such as Violet Affleck, Suri Cruise and Kingston Rossdale often get as much, if not more, press as their famous parents. Baby bumps and due dates are increasingly popular topics of conversation on the red carpet. You've seen the names in recent headlines -- Benicio Del Toro, Mariska Hargitay and, most recently, Bruce Willis -- but one celebrity has been slightly ignored in the realm of celebrity baby watchers: Jessica Simpson. Rumor has it that the singer/actress/reality show star/fashion designer is pregnant with her first child with her fiancÃ©, former NFL player Eric Johnson. But, besides from some idle speculation, not much has been made of the blessed event -- well, except for some jokes at Jess' expense. She has been seen strolling around with a rotund tummy, most recently holding hands with Johnson while rubbing said belly. On Monday tweeted confirmation that she is pregnant by posing in a mummy costume and cradling her belly with the words ""It's true -- I""m going to be a mummy!"" Despite the added tidbit that Simpson's ex Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo recently announced at a local event that ""I actually have one on the way"" with his wife, the interest in a Simpson's pregnancy seems decidedly muted. According to outlets like the New York Post, Simpson's father/manager, Joe, hasn't even been successful in getting the media to bite. Stories are circulating that he has been trying to sell the story of the alleged pregnancy (and, of course the first mama/baby photos) to the tabloids, possibly because his daughter has been seen about town sporting what appears to be a rather obvious baby bump. So why aren't the celebrity-driven media going ga-ga about this star mama? You could try to attribute the lack of interest about the future baby boy or baby girl Simpson to some sort of collective ""baby fatigue,"" but that theory doesn't stand up to the hoopla that surrounded the first public appearance of Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon's twin babies, Moroccan and Monroe (accompanied by not only a ""20/20"" interview with Barbara Walters but a week's worth of teasers showing just the backs of their heads). We'd like to offer a couple of theories as to why the entertainment industry and fans are generally apathetic to the Simpson pregnancy: . The Maury defense: We know who the father is . When actresses fail to disclose the name of the child's father, we become all the more curious about the offspring. Take the recent case of ""Mad Men"" star January Jones. A number of actors have been fingered as potential fathers of Jones' son, Xander. The mystery daddy isn't a new phenomenon. Remember when Melissa Etheridge and her then-girlfriend enlisted the services of an undisclosed sperm donor to father their children, only to get even more attention when it was revealed that the donor in question was legendary rocker David Crosby? Johnson has been the only man in Jessica's life for quite a while, and there's no doubt as to paternity. If Simpson had been seen around town with maybe a former flame like John Mayer or even the aforementioned Romo, she could have gotten some tongues wagging. Scandal? What scandal? Exactly. It may boil down to a lack of interest in Simpson as a headline-grabbing celebrity. Many women, myself included, would say she's got an impressive line of shoes, but as of late, she hasn't done much of note -- either famously or infamously. She hasn't had a hit single in quite a while. Her films have been largely straight-to-video flops (""Major Movie Star"" or ""Blonde Ambition,"" anyone?) and she's not been able to replicate her success in the reality TV genre after the demise of ""Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica"" (""The Price of Beauty"" on VH1 just didn't cut it). Poor Jess can't even register much of a blip in the scandal sheets. Her biggest scandal in the past few years revolves around her questionable taste in pants (the infamous ""Mom Jeans"" incident of 2009). Her upcoming reality project, ""Fashion Star,"" could get her back in the headlines, but we suggest a Demi Moore-esque nude pregnancy photo shoot to get a little tabloid love. The name game . Maybe we just have to wait until Simpson gives birth to draw some attention to her imminent motherhood. The announcement of celebrity baby names is quite a big deal in the entertainment press, especially when the chosen name isn't one you're likely to hear on the playground any time soon, like Jason Lee's son Pilot Inspektor or Nicolas Cage's son Kal-El. If Simpson wants some guaranteed media attention, she could name her kid Chicken C. Simpson. It's no secret; millions of people have babies every day. But, it's slightly ironic that a woman whose first marriage and divorce we watched faithfully on the boob tube has lost the audience for the possible birth of her first child. Regardless if anyone outside her immediate family cares, since she's due for a blessed event, that should be her top priority -- headline or no headline.","NEW: Jessica Simpson confirms her pregnancy .

"(CNN)  -- Earthquake scientist James Roddey is known up and down the Oregon coast as the ""prophet of doom"" -- a nickname that seems even more ominous after the disaster in Japan.  As an earth science officer for the state, Roddey educates communities on how to prepare and survive the earthquake and tsunami that he predicts is virtually inevitable. ""They want to know more. They want to know what they can do,"" said Roddey, who spoke to CNN on Monday shortly before his scheduled appearance at an Oregon school near Gold Beach.   He's the bearer of bad news. Very bad news: there's a one-in-three chance that a major quake will strike the region by 2061, according to Oregon State University scientists. The risk lies along a fault line that extends near Newport, Oregon, to Northern California. Despite those odds, many Oregon coast residents are nonchalant about the threat of a catastrophe on the scale of the temblor that struck Japan last week. ""A lot of people don't even realize that we get earthquakes in Oregon,"" Roddey explained.  ""This used to be the place where Californians moved to get away from earthquakes."" As Japan reels from what its prime minister called its ""toughest crisis"" since World War II, emergency preparedness officials in the United States around the world are paying close attention. Friday's 9.0-magnitude quake was the strongest in recorded history to hit Japan, according to U.S. Geological Survey. ""What you are seeing in Japan today is what you will also see in our future,"" said Oregon State University geologist Robert Yeats. ""Except they're better prepared than we are."" Disaster preparations have been permanently imprinted on Japan's collective memory since the terrible Kanto earthquake in 1923 killed more than 140,000 people. The breathtaking damage from this most recent quake speaks to how bad the toll could have been -- if not for preparation. ""On a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the most prepared and zero being the worst-prepared ever, you can put Haiti at zero, you can put Japan at eight and you can put the U.S. at five,"" said Erwann Michel-Kerjan, managing director of the Risk Management and Decision Processes Center at the Wharton School.   A nation's mindset surrounding disaster preparedness is directly linked to disaster frequency, say experts. But even in California, where so many quakes have occurred, less than 10% of residents have earthquake insurance, Michel-Kerjan said. Nuclear power plants . Last week's earthquake and subsequent tsunami triggered fires, explosions, and radiation leaks at Japan's nuclear power plants.  That has raised concerns of a far more dangerous radiation threat in Japan. It has also prompted a discussion in the United States and around the world about nuclear power safety. Some U.S. lawmakers are calling for new nuclear plant projects to be put on hold until regulations can be examined. The United States nuclear reactors operate at 65 plants across the country. In addition, there are dozens of reactors, weapons labs and other nuclear facilities associated with national defense. Most of the civilian plants are located near major population centers.  See locations of U.S. nuclear power facilities . There hasn't been a new nuclear plant commissioned and completed in the United States since the Three Mile Island meltdown in Pennsylvania in 1979, although dozens that were approved at the time have come on line. Federal regulators are reviewing 20 applications to build nuclear plants, and several existing facilities have applied to extend their operating licenses. Typically, nuclear power plants are designed to withstand natural disasters, including earthquakes. Perhaps the most vulnerable U.S. nuclear power plants are two located in the quake-prone state of California.  The Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo and the San Onofre station, north of San Diego, were built along Pacific coast near the San Andreas Fault. Opinion:  Japan and the future of U.S. nuclear power . Those plants were built to withstand a magnitude-7.5 earthquake, said Robert Alvarez, a nuclear expert at the Institute for Policy Studies and a former senior official at the U.S. Department of Energy. If there was a nuclear catastrophe, health officials warn that there are ""substantial gaps"" in how prepared the United States is for a ""major radiation emergency event,"" an American Medical Association journal reports "" Preparing for the tsunami threat . Back in Oregon, the shoreline community of Cannon Beach has proposed construction of a tall, reinforced municipal office building that would double as a tsunami shelter. ""You're looking at a $4 million building in a community that's only 1,700 people,"" said Roddey. ""A small community like that can't raise the money by themselves."" Cannon Beach is seeking federal money to help fund the project, which may include deep foundations and seawalls to protect against the ocean's crushing forces. Would U.S. taxpayers -- especially with the ongoing budget battles in Washington -- be willing to shell out more money to save lives and limit property damage from natural disasters? The world became acutely aware of the widespread damage a tsunami can cause in December 2004, when a massive quake triggered a wave that swept across the Indian Ocean, wiping out villages in several south Asian countries, killing over 200,000 people. Since then, Asia had taken big steps to improve its warning systems, the United Nations said. In the United States, budget cuts could directly effect the country's tsunami preparation system.  A spending plan passed last month by House Republicans allegedly would result in cuts to the National Weather Service's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Republicans deny their budget would specifically reduce the tsunami center. Whatever the case, some argue that cutting the center would be shortsighted. The American Society of Civil Engineers says that paying for resilient critical infrastructure before a disaster strikes saves money and lives in the long run, according to its 2008 report. ""Consider that an additional $2 billion investment in the levees surrounding New Orleans may have reduced the tragic loss of life caused by Hurricane Katrina,"" the report said. Making safer buildings and bridges . In Japan, engineers must adhere to strict construction codes aimed at making structures quake-resistant. ""The Japanese spend more of a premium on the construction of their buildings,"" said professor Stephen Mahin of the University of California, Berkeley. ""When you buy a condo in Japan, the owners and engineers will make a big point of the seismic safety of a building. Here in the United States, that kind of thing may not even be mentioned."" In the western United States, public buildings that are deemed critical have been strengthened against quakes in major cities from Seattle south to San Diego and east to Salt Lake City, he said. Major universities, including the University of California, have spent millions of dollars over the past 20 years upgrading their existing buildings, said Ronald Hamburger of the American Society of Civil Engineers. Private corporations that include AT&T, Hewlett-Packard, Procter & Gamble and Sears have spent significant money upgrading their buildings against quakes, he added. And, in California, nearly all of the state's bridges have been retrofitted for seismic resistance. ""We are far better off today than we were 20 years ago,"" said Hamburger. However, if a repeat of San Francisco's 1906 7.8-magnitude quake hits Los Angeles, San Francisco or Seattle, Hamburger said, ""I would not be surprised if one or two of the high-rise buildings in those cities would collapse."" Most of the high-rise office buildings built in those cities before the mid-1990s do not meet current standards for new construction, and most of them have not been upgraded, said Hamburger. ""Those buildings were designed in the 1960s, '70s and '80s,"" he said. ""The building codes in place in the Western U.S. in those years were far better than building code requirements in force in the Eastern U.S. today, but they're really not adequate for an event like what Japan experienced."" Risk to shipping ports . Key California shipping ports that lie in quake zones, such as Los Angeles, Long Beach and Oakland, may also be at risk, although a 2007 study suggested the danger from tsunamis was minimal because the major fault lines in the area are on shore. These ports represent major U.S. revenue arteries. But because many of the facilities at these ports were built in the 1960s and '70s, they could sustain damage from a big earthquake or tsunami, according to experts. Upgrading these facilities could cost in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. A Georgia Tech team of engineers, including professor Glenn Rix, is developing new, less expensive construction methods aimed at protecting shipping ports from possible destruction. Rix is studying the use of prefabricated plastic vertical drains in the wharf structure, which might allow for easier upgrades to protect against quakes. Raising awareness . After the Kanto earthquake, Japan established National Disaster Reduction Day as a way to teach future generations about preparedness. Other nations have created similar holidays, including Bangladesh, Chile, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Madagascar, Mexico, Mozambique and Vietnam, according to the UN.  To raise awareness in the United States, Americans should focus more on education, said Roddey, so they can  raise support for disaster preparation and ultimately  save lives. ""The United States needs to take more preventative action to prepare for disasters, said Roddey. ""If I had my hands on the purse strings I'd be spending hundreds of thousands -- if not millions of dollars -- to educate people, and to move schools and other critical facilities out of the inundation zones."" For Roddey, the right thing to do is crystal clear: Look to what the experts are predicting and act rather than react. ""We're the first generation in modern history that understands the risks and consequences of an event like what happened in Japan,"" said Roddey. ""How we prepare for it here literally defines us as a people.""

"(CNN) -- Ten months into the uprising in Syria, deadly clashes between opposition fighters and government forces have now spread to suburbs just 15 minutes from the heart of the capital Damascus. What's the latest on the ground? Syria's humanitarian crisis is worsening as armed rebels and government forces battle for control of towns and cities across the country. Much of Ghouta, in the eastern suburbs of Damascus, faces a ""complete siege and closure"" after days of sustained bombings that has killed dozens, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees. Electricity, water, heating fuel and food are in short supply, and communications have been interrupted, the LCC said, as Syrian forces battle to take back neighborhoods located uncomfortably close to President Bashar al-Assad's seat of power in the capital. At least 37 people were confirmed dead across several cities Tuesday, according to the LCC. The group reported 100 deaths Monday. A resident of Homs said six members of one family were found dead. In one part of Homs, Syrian forces battled to take back a neighborhood from the rebel army and anti-government protesters, according to an opposition activist who asked that his identity be withheld over a fear of government reprisal. The dead and wounded littered the streets of the neighborhood, which was under siege, the activist said. More than 5,000 people have died since March, when the government launched a crackdown against demonstrators, according to the United Nations. Opposition groups estimate a higher death toll, with counts near or exceeding 7,000 people. How is the international community reacting? The Arab League suspended its monitoring mission in Syria on Saturday, recalling all of its observers around the country to Damascus as violence escalates. While some Arab League monitors will leave the country, others will stay in Damascus, but none will be conducting missions at this time, according to Ali Erfan, senior advisor to Arab League Secretary General Nabil el-Araby. On Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council failed to reach an agreement on a resolution that would call for al-Assad to step down. Arab and Western diplomats voiced their support for the draft resolution, but representatives from Russia and China slammed it as meddlesome. Russia -- which, like China, is one of the five veto-wielding permanent members of the Security Council -- has said it is concerned about a Syrian civil war and does not want al-Assad pushed out of power. It has proposed its own draft resolution that assigns equal blame for the violence on both al-Assad and the opposition. The draft that will now be considered also lacks sanctions but is tougher than the earlier version, which said nothing about transfer of power. The Syrian regime has been under international pressure to stop the crackdown -- and the U.N., the United States, the European Union and some members of the Arab League have called for President al-Assad to step down. What did the Arab League monitors achieve in Syria? The Arab League monitoring mission in Syria has been criticized for failing to stop the al-Assad regime's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests across the country. Read profile of President Bashar al-Assad . But the head of the Arab League observers in Syria, Sudanese Gen. Mohammed Ahmed al-Dabi, said the mission was designed not to bring an immediate end to violence but to investigate and observe the situation. The choice of Al-Dabi to lead the mission was controversial in itself: he was part of the Sudanese security establishment that put down the rebellion in the breakaway region of Darfur a decade ago. Still, one expert says the Arab League mission, which began on December 26, kept the world's attention focused on Syria at a time when attention had been slipping away. ""The presence of monitors served to galvanize the opposition, and we saw an increased number of demonstrations and anti-government activity during that time period,"" Middle East professor Chris Phillips from Queen Mary, University of London told CNN. ""But as a consequence we also saw the government step up its visible repression of the protesters."" While critics say al-Assad has used the Arab League mission as a cover to continue suppression of protests in Syria, Phillips says it was important that the League be seen to be acting on the Syrian crisis before taking the issue up with bigger organizations. ""The Arab League have now exhausted their own internal options and they can be seen to have taken action themselves to try to resolve the crisis,"" said Phillips. ""It would now seem legitimate for the Arab League to now turn to larger bodies, certainly the U.N., to take action itself."" Individual states in the Arab League have called for al-Assad to step down, but the organization as a whole has failed to table a similar resolution -- and Phillips says that is unlikely to change anytime soon. ""While it seems likely there is going to be some internal negotiation (on a resolution) taking place, it certainly seems very unlikely Lebanon or Iraq -- states who are allied effectively to Iran and Syria -- will ever join calls for Assad to stand down,"" said Phillips. Will the international community intervene like it did in Libya? Nothing will happen in terms of military intervention in Syria unless Russia changes its current stance, according to Phillips. ""Russia have said quite clearly that they're not going to support anything that would risk al-Assad being forced from power,"" Phillips told CNN. ""If Russia gave the same kind of green light for Syria that it did for Libya, there's every possibility that you'd see military intervention, probably coming out of Turkey,"" Phillips said. ""But Turkey have said they're highly reluctant to intervene unless they have NATO or U.N. backing."" Rights group Amnesty International urged Russia Wednesday to rethink its opposition to the latest draft. ""Russia's threats to abort a binding U.N. Security Council resolution on Syria for the second time are utterly irresponsible. Russia bears a heavy responsibility for allowing the brutal crackdown on legitimate dissent in Syria to continue unchecked,"" said Jose Luis Diaz, Amnesty International's representative to the United Nations. ""Russia must work with other Security Council members to pass a strong and legally binding resolution that will help to end the bloodshed and human rights violations in Syria once and for all."" Is the opposition united against the al-Assad regime? The longer the fighting goes on in Syria, activists and Western diplomats say, the more radicalized the revolution is becoming. Fringe elements of Muslim extremist groups are moving in and sectarian rifts are widening as feelings of despair descend on some flashpoint Syrian cities. While the besieged city of Homs has traditionally been a place of religious tolerance, ""there is a real sense now that that is changing and being manipulated by people on both sides"" of the conflict, according to Phillips. President al-Assad belongs to the Alawite Muslim sect while Sunni Muslims form the majority in Syria. ""The older Sunni merchant class that feel the city is theirs rightfully are now turning on the Alawites, who they see as these recent migrants that don't actually belong in the city,"" said Phillips. Many Christians have fled to Damascus as communities begin to divide on sectarian lines. Salafists -- Islamic radicals, many of whom have brought terror tactics honed in neighboring Iraq -- are moving into Homs. Hard-liners inside and outside the country are already jockeying for post-al-Assad power, while the Alawite community fears the prospect of persecution if the government falls. ""The regime is trying to persuade the Alawites that if they abandon the government, they will be wiped out in the dog-eat-dog aftermath,"" Phillips said.

"(CNN) -- You don't expect while lecturing about politics on a ship to become a political pawn in a two hundred year-old territorial dispute, but that is what has happened to me and several thousand other passengers who cruised into the middle of the renewed spat between Britain and Argentina over who should control the Falkland Islands. This week two cruise liners flying British colony flags -- the 750-passenger Adonia and 2,600 passenger Star Princess -- were denied permission to dock in the Argentinean port of Ushuia because the ships had previously called in at Stanley in the Falkland Islands. Both vessels had visited Port Stanley in the Falklands on Saturday, February 25 as part of their widely advertised and published schedules. The Adonia left the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires late at night on February 20, later than was intended as the result of what was explained as industrial action by tugmen. I joined the Adonia at the Rio de la Plata terminal in Buenos Aires with an almost total absence of customs and immigration formalities. I'd flown into town the day before without incident, so there was no advance warning of any potential threat or the action to come. We were due to proceed from Port Stanley in the Falklands to the world's southernmost city, the Argentine port of Ushuaia, on February 27, having passed Cape Horn on the way. But early that morning, at around 6:00 a.m., the Adonia's commanding office Captain David Perkins announced to passengers that he and the Chilean pilots already on board the vessel to help chart it through the Tierra del Fuego archipelago had been informed that the mayor of Ushuaia was refusing to allow the Adonia into port. We would therefore be carrying on earlier than had been intended to the Chilean port of Punta Arenas. The explanation given from Ushuaia was that the ban was being imposed because the Adonia had previously called at the Falklands, which Argentina refers to as Las Malvinas. No advance warning had been given that such action would be taken if the Adonia did call at the Falklands, as around 20 cruise ships a month do in this summer season in the southern hemisphere. The vast majority of the passengers on the Adonia are British. The Adonia left Southampton on January 13 on an 87-day journey around South America. It was only after the vessel left Southampton that the latest Anglo-Argentinean spat over the Falklands hotted up with news that the Duke of Cambridge -- or Flight Lieutenant Wales as he is known in his role as a Royal Air Force helicopter pilot -- was undertaking a six-week tour of duty in the Falklands on what the Ministry of Defence insists is a routine deployment. This triggered protests from the Argentine government, as did the news that Britain was dispatching to the South Atlantic HMS Dauntless, a Type 45 destroyer, which is its most sophisticated warship armed with missiles which could if required take out much of the Argentinean air force. Argentina has protested at what it calls a militarization of the area. It has to be said that the mayor of Ushuaia's action, which would have cost his city dearly as the spending power of some 3,000 cruise passengers on the two ships was not unleashed, has been taken phlegmatically by the Adonia's passengers. The only thing that people had to check themselves from saying was ""Oh well, it isn't the end of the world"" because it is precisely that which Ushuaia advertises itself as being. Many passengers were looking forward to acquiring souvenirs which proclaimed that that was where they had been. Cruise ship passengers with any company are accustomed to schedules being changed at short notice, whether it is as a result of storms, fogs, strikes or political events. On the current voyage the Adonia had to spend an extra day in Barbados to await delayed supplies and it missed one scheduled call in Brazil because of a local police strike which might have made it risky for passengers to go ashore. From the explanation given by Argentine embassy personnel in some countries it seems that the mayor of Ushuaia may have somewhat over-interpreted his brief. The Argentine government, they confirmed, had banned the refuelling and bunkering in Argentine ports of oil exploration vessels and other commercial shipping which has previously visited the Falklands. According to those embassy sources there was allegedly no ban affecting individuals who had been to the Falklands visiting Argentina, but that rather begs the question of how the individuals would get to and from Port Stanley. Precious few of us can walk on water. Argentina's Peronist President Christina Kirchner has been largely responsible for raising the temperature over the Falklands as the 30th anniversary of the successful war undertaken by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government to regain the islands after the invasion by Argentina's military junta approaches. Voted back into office with 54% support only three months ago, President Kirchner dismisses Britain as ""a coarse and decadent colonial power"" and is appealing to other South American countries to join her in isolating the Falklands while they remain under British control. Her latest action, now supplemented by calls for a boycott of British goods by Argentineans, will raise an intriguing dilemma for tour companies. A visit to the Falklands is one of the biggest draws for Britons booking cruises around South America. But if a call at Port Stanley is going to lead to the cruise ships being banned from Argentinean ports, and perhaps eventually ports in other South American countries, how long will they keep Port Stanley on their itineraries? Intriguingly, as I was wandering around Buenos Aires the other day I came across the memorial to the Argentineans who lost their lives in what they call the Malvinas War. In English a tour guide was giving his version of the events 30 years ago. ""The generals were in charge here,"" he said, ""and they told us that we were a strong and well-armed nation. They lied to us. We weren't. The British had a lot more practice than us at fighting warsâ€”and we lost."" The Falklands, he said, belonged to Argentina ""geographically,"" an argument I suppose which could be used to claim that Cuba ""belonged"" to the United States. So what about the Falklanders themselves, said one of his listeners, wasn't it up to them to decide who they wanted to belong to? That didn't appeal to the guide. ""Ah well,"" he replied, ""if you had a choice between voting to be rich and voting to be poor, which way would you vote?""","Argentina bars entry to two Bermuda-flagged ships after they visit Falklands .

"(CNN) -- Williams and Toro Rosso both unveiled their cars for the 2012 Formula Season on Tuesday as the first official preseason testing event began at the Jerez circuit in Spain. Williams, a legendary name in F1 with nine constructors' titles but none since 1997, hope the FW34 will help the UK-based team improve on a disappointing 2011 campaign which produced just five points in 19 races. Williams recruited Brazilian Bruno Senna as a replacement for his veteran compatriot Rubens Barrichello, who is without an F1 seat for the first time since 1993. Senna is following in the footsteps of his legendary uncle Ayrton, a three-time world champion who died following a crash at Imola in 1994 in his third race for Williams. Can Senna restore the romance to Formula One? ""I'm very excited to be back in action,"" the 28-year-old, who raced for Renault in the second half of last season, told the team's official website. ""This is my ever first preseason testing program since I started in Formula One two years ago. ""I'm really motivated and looking forward to working hard and with everyone in the team. I hope we have a successful month testing and developing the car so we arrive in Melbourne as well prepared as possible."" Senna will be paired with Pastor Maldonado, the Venezuelan who scored only one point during his rookie F1 season in 2011. Maldonado posted the 11th-fastest lap at Jerez on the first of four test days. Vettel: 'Red Bull out to dominate again' ""It feels great to be back with the team and to start putting some mileage on the FW34,"" said the 26-year-old. ""The car felt good and the systems were all working well this morning. ""I like the feel of the new Renault engine as well. It's still too early to make any predictions, but we are pushing hard and working to understand the car better."" Toro Rosso hope to build on an encouraging 2011 haul of 41 points -- the Italy-based team's highest total in F1. Australia's Daniel Ricciardo forms a new driver line-up with French rookie Jean-Eric Vergne, replacing Switzerland's Sebastien Buemi and Spaniard Jaime Alguersuari. Ricciardo spent the second half of last season racing for Spanish team HRT, but failed to finish higher than 18th in any of his 11 grands prix. He drove for Toro Rosso on Tuesday and posted a lap of one minute 20.694 seconds -- the fifth-fastest time. ""It was great to experience taking a completely new car out of the garage,"" the 22-year-old said. ""We had a very productive morning and made good progress with our program. ""Then in the afternoon, we did a couple of longer runs, but had to cut it short. I'm looking forward to another productive day tomorrow, because this car is very enjoyable to drive."" Vergne -- a Formula Three world champion two years ago -- drove Red Bull's 2010 championship-winning car at last November's young drivers' test event in Abu Dhabi. ""Last year, we finished eighth in the constructors' championship and clearly we want to do better than that this time,"" said team principal Franz Tost. ""It is far too early to make predictions, but looking at the work we have done over the winter, we must set ourselves the target of finishing sixth or at least seventh by the time we pack up in Brazil in November."" The returning Kimi Raikkonen led the field for Lotus at Jerez with a time of 1:19.670. The 2007 world champion left the elite division of motorsport in 2009 and has since had spells in NASCAR and the World Rally Championship. Force India's British driver Paul di Resta was second fastest on 1:19.772, with Mercedes' German pilot Niko Rosberg third. Australian Mark Webber was on display for Red Bull -- with reigning champion Sebastian Vettel set for outings Thursday and Friday -- and posted the fourth-fastest time with a lap of 1:20.496. The 2009 title winner Jenson Button could only manage eighth place for McLaren, with Ferrari's Brazilian Felipe Massa ninth. Button's fellow Brit and the 2008 champion Lewis Hamilton will be in action for McLaren on Thursday and Friday, along with Ferrari's two-time title winner Fernando Alonso.","Williams and Toro Rosso unveil new cars at Jerez on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored four times as Barcelona routed Valencia to keep alive their slim chances of overhauling Real Madrid at the top of Spain's La Liga. The Argentina striker took his tally for the league season to 27, one behind Real's Cristiano Ronaldo, and has scored 44 in all competitions for the Spanish and European champions this campaign. Barcelona's win closed the gap on Real Madrid to 10 points, though Jose Mourinho's side are still the overwhelming favorites to clinch the title with two and a half months of the season remaining. ""We're so lucky to be living in a time when these players play. This team dignifies the sport,"" coach Pep Guardiola said of his team's performance. ""It's a shame we're so far away. I sincerely believe that our play isn't representative of being 10 points down, but we are, and we have to live with it. The distance is what it is, let's see if we can fulfill our job."" Messi celebrated his 200th La Liga game for Barca with his 15th hat-trick for the Catalan club, and the 24-year-old has now notched 146 goals. ""It's important that the team has found its form again, like we did in Germany (last week in the Champions League). We have to keep on playing like this, important games are coming up,"" Messi said. He hopes that Guardiola will renew his one-year contract and stay at the Nou Camp for a fifth season as coach. ""The manager knows what we think, but he will make his decision at the appropriate time. Obviously, we all want him to stay at Barca because, to us, he's very important."" Third-placed Valencia opened the scoring at Camp Nou with Pablo Piatti's ninth-minute strike, but a two-goal burst from Messi put Barcelona ahead after 26 minutes. Messi then pounced on a loose ball in the area to claim his hat-trick before a cheeky, scooped finish when clean through on goal made it four -- the second time he has done so for Barca. Spain midfielder Xavi put the seal on an emphatic victory in stoppage time. Benzema brace helps Madrid stretch lead . Elsewhere, Athletic Bilbao moved into fourth after a 3-1 win over Malaga as Fernando Amorebieta, Mikel San Jose and Gaizka Toquero scored the goals. Atletico Madrid stayed sixth with a 1-1 draw away at Sporting Gijon, as Sebastian Eguren equalized for the home side after Roberto Canella's own goal. Granada moved away from the drop zone after beating Real Sociedad 4-1, both teams having a man sent off, while Mallorca thumped Villarreal 4-0 with Victor Casadesus grabbing two goals. Rayo Vallecano moved up to eighth with a 5-3 win at Levante, Diego Da Silva Costa and Lass scoring two goals each. In Italy, AC Milan usurped Juventus at the top of the table with a 3-1 win at Cesena. Sulley Muntari, Urby Emanuelson and Brazilian forward Robinho were on target as Milan went a point clear. Udinese moved into third place on goal difference despite a 0-0 draw at home to Cagliari, due to Lazio's 5-1 defeat at Palermo. A Fabio Borini goal was enough to see AS Roma past Parma and into fifth place. Novara climbed off the foot of the table after a 0-0 draw at home to Atalanta, while Lecce thumped Siena 4-1 despite going a goal behind. Cyril Thereau scored the winner as Chievo won away at Genoa. In Germany, Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored twice as Schalke beat VfL Wolfsburg 4-1 as they closed within one point of third-placed Bayern Munich.

"(CNN) -- Apple's new iPad wasn't the only game in town this week. More than 18,000 videogame makers gathered in San Francisco at the 26th annual Game Developers Convention (GDC 2012) to discuss the future of interactive entertainment. While there was plenty of talk about the explosion of casual and social games and how new smartphones and tablets are luring even more users into gaming, there were also plenty of brand new ""AAA"" games debuting at the Moscone Center and surrounding area hotels. ""What always amazes me at a show like GDC is the fact that there's always a smoke chasing vibe about what's hot and what's interesting this year,"" said Cliff Bleszinski, design director at Epic Games, which was showcasing its new Unreal Engine 4 technology at the show. ""Over the last several years we've seen the rise of freemium gaming and social mobile, and it's something we're willing to experiment with when you look at games such as Infinity Blade on iOS. But I'm of the belief that we're here to remind people that AAA is here to stay and people will always want beautiful, $60-quality gaming experiences."" The following are five big games that stood out at GDC that are worth picking up when they arrive later this year on a console, PC or gaming device: . 'Medal of Honor Warfighter' Electronic Arts is leaving the intense combat of Afghanistan for the broader war on terrorism in this latest first-person shooter, which sends players to global hot spots like the Philippines and the Somali coast on missions to rescue hostages and battle pirates. Executive producer Greg Goodrich said the new game, which ships October 23, features covert missions inspired by actual Tier 1 Operators and events ripped straight from news headlines. The game makers are working with former soldiers to ensure an authentic, yet intense, experience. In an attempt to expand the appeal of the franchise, the multi-player experience allows gamers to play take control of Special Forces from 12 countries, including Australian SASR, British SAS, German KSK and Polish GROM. 'Hawken' A brand new game publisher, Meteor Entertainment, showed off a very different free-to-play PC gaming experience with ""Hawken."" Set on a post-apocalyptic, human-colonized planet that has been industrialized to the point of collapse, players pilot giant robotic Mechs armed to the teeth. The fast-paced gameplay focuses on intense battle experiences in a futuristic world that has Asian influences, a la ""Blade Runner."" The development team utilized the free Unreal Development Kit to bring the first-person action to life and watched as a YouTube video created a bidding war that ultimately gave life to a new game company. One of the key trends at GDC is the evolution of free-to-play games to more console-quality experiences. Hawken goes live December 12, 2012. 'LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes' This is a very big year for DC Comics fans with ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and ""Man of Steel"" hitting theaters. The latest ""LEGO Batman"" game manages to celebrate both of these beloved super heroes in an incredibly detailed open world Gotham City. Due out this summer across all platforms, the new LEGO game introduces a wide cast of superheroes like Wonder Woman and Green Lantern, and super villains like Lex Luthor and The Joker. The ability to fly through the city as Superman or play with Batman and Robin's cool vehicles like the Batmobile and Batwing, should appeal to kids of all ages. There's a reason the first LEGO Batman sold over 11 million copies, and this sequel pushes the fun forward with some of the most amazing visuals yet seen in a LEGO game. Full disclosure: This game is produced by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, which, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner. 'Sleeping Dogs' ""Grand Theft Auto V"" isn't the only open-world crime story coming out this year. With ""Sleeping Dogs,"" developer United Front Games introduces a virtual Hong Kong, complete with John Woo-style action. The game's storyline focuses on a gritty undercover tale that sends players into the underbelly of the triads as cop Wei Shen. With intuitive one-button action that allows players to pull off Hollywood-inspired maneuvers like jumping from a motorcycle onto the roof of a speeding car, this game offers intense action across multiple fronts. Gamers can drive vehicles, including speedboats, pick up an assortment of weapons -- or just use their fists to take down enemies. Players will be able to explore all aspects of this city later this year. 'Assassin's Creed III' After exploring history in the Middle Ages and the Italian Renaissance, Ubisoft is focusing on the American Revolution in its latest action-adventure game. This game puts players in control of Connor, a hero of Native-American and English heritage. Combat is carried by using knives, bows-and-arrows and a trusty tomahawk. Players interact with historical figures like George Washington, Ben Franklin and Charles Lee. They also experience 18th century events like the burning of New York and the Battle of Valley Forge. In addition to taking part in the Continental Army's battle against the British redcoats, gameplay includes more open frontier terrain. With more fluid and streamlined controls, American history has never been so much fun.","More than 18,000 videogame makers gathered at the Game Developers Convention .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City powered into the last 16 of the Europa League with a 4-0 win over holders Porto Wednesday at the Etihad Stadium. The English Premier League leaders had a 2-1 advantage from the first leg in Portugal and went through 6-1 on aggregate. It is the second boost in 24 hours for manager Roberto Mancini, who has finally drawn an apology from striker Carlos Tevez after a three-month standoff which left the Argentine star on the sidelines. Tevez told the club's official website: ""I wish to apologize sincerely and unreservedly to everybody I have let down and to whom my actions over the last few months have caused offence. ""My wish is to concentrate on playing football for Manchester City."" Blog: Should City accept apology from Tevez? He also withdrew his appeal to the Premier League against a fine of six weeks' wages. Mancini confirmed in his post-match interview that he had ""no problem"" with Tevez after his apology. ""He needs a good two to three weeks to train but if he is ready he can play,"" the Italian told ESPN. Mancini picked a strong team for their second leg tie against Porto and he was rewarded when Sergio Aguero opened the scoring after just 18 seconds. It was the 20th goal of the season for Tevez's international teammate. Porto, watched by their former manager Andre Villas-Boas, enjoyed good possession, but rarely tested Joe Hart in the home goal. Their fate was sealed when Aguero played in substitute Edin Dzeko for the second late on. Porto had Rolando sent off for a second yellow card and City rubbed it in with further late strikes from David Silva and David Pizarro. Manchester United, 2-0 up from their first leg, can join arch local rivals City in the last 16 when they face ff Ajax at Old Trafford Thursday, but will be missing Wayne Rooney for the match.","Manchester City beat Porto 4-0 in Europa League last 32 second leg tie .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Investors were unable to trade shares in scores of companies listed in Tokyo for several hours Thursday after a computer problem at the city's stock exchange.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Poland over the signing of an international treaty to enforce intellectual property rights on the Internet. Police said more than 10,000 people have taken part in the countrywide protests, which began Wednesday and are set to continue Friday. A group of lawmakers in parliament also protested the signing Thursday in Tokyo by the Polish ambassador to Japan. The legislation must be ratified by the Polish parliament before coming into effect. Protesters held signs and banners reading ""No to ACTA."" Their protests were largely peaceful, though there were a few skirmishes in the city of Poznan, where protesters threw bottles at police. Activists hacked several websites, including that of the prime minister, to protest the signing. The activists say the treaty -- called ACTA, or the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement -- amounts to Internet censorship. The European Commission describes ACTA as a ""major initiative"" designed to fight piracy and the counterfeiting of goods at the international level. It says the agreement would not censor or shut down websites and, unlike the SOPA bill recently put on hold in the U.S. Congress, it would not change legislation. ACTA allows criminal procedures and penalties to be applied in cases of counterfeiting and piracy, such as the unauthorized copying of movies. Penalties would be applied to offenders as well as those guilty of ""aiding and abetting"" the crime. The actual penalties would be up to the individual countries that have signed onto ACTA. SOPA, introduced by the U.S. House of Representatives, and a sister bill in the Senate called PIPA, aim to crack down on copyright infringement by restricting access to websites that host or facilitate the trading of pirated content. CNN's Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.","The bill would fight counterfeiting and piracy .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Marine Corps on Friday identified the seven killed in a midair collision of two of its helicopters this week along the Arizona-California border. The Marines, who were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan, were killed Wednesday in a collision between an AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter and a UH-1Y Huey utility helicopter. The Marines were identified as: . _Maj. Thomas A. Budrejko, 37, of Montville, Connecticut. He was commissioned as an officer by the Marine Corps on May 24, 1996, and served as an AH-1W Cobra pilot and executive officer of attack squadron 469. _Capt. Michael M. Quin, 28, of Purcellville, Virginia. He was commissioned as an officer by on May 26, 2006, and served as a UH-1Y Huey pilot. _Capt. Benjamin N. Cerniglia, 31, of Montgomery, Alabama. He was commissioned as an officer on December 14, 2007, and served as an AH-1W Cobra pilot. _Sgt. Justin A. Everett, 33, of Clovis, California. He enlisted in the Marine Corps on February 19, 2002, and served as a helicopter crew chief aboard a UH-1Y Huey. _Lance Cpl. Corey A. Little, 25, of Marietta, Georgia. He enlisted on March 30, 2009, and served as a helicopter crew chief aboard a UH-1Y Huey. _Lance Cpl. Nickoulas H. Elliott, 21, of Spokane, Washington. He on May 4, 2009, and served as a helicopter crew chief aboard a UH-1Y Huey. _Capt. Nathan W. Anderson, 32, of Amarillo, Texas. He was commissioned as an officer on December 20, 2002, and served as a UH-1Y Huey pilot. Anderson was assigned to Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona, while the other six were assigned to the Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469, Marine Aircraft Group 39, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at Camp Pendleton, California, the Marine Corps said in a statement. ""Every single one of these Marines impacted our squadron in their own special way and the entire Marine Corps aviation community is feeling their tragic loss,"" said Lt. Col. Stephen Lightfoot, commanding officer of Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469. The cause of the collision, which occurred during routine training operations, remains under investigation, the Marines said. The crash occurred Wednesday night around 10:30 p.m. ET in the Chocolate Mountains on the California side of the range, near Yuma, according to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma Base Commander Col. Robert Kuckuk. While weather did not appear to play a factor, visibility may have been severely limited by nightfall and a significant amount of dust, referred to as a ""brown out,"" created by the helicopters landing and taking off, Gunnery Sgt.

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- When speaking to the tech-savvy attendees of South by Southwest Interactive, it doesn't hurt to lead with a Web reference -- even if you're the former vice president. ""Our democracy has been hacked,"" said Al Gore. ""It no longer works, in the main, to serve the interests of our people."" Gore joined Sean Parker, the mind behind Napster and founding president of Facebook, on a two-man panel at the digital festival Monday during which both decried the influence of money in politics and pointed to the Internet as the answer. Parker, whose Napster nearly single-handedly started a revolution in how people acquire and consume music, alluded to his past during the hour-long talk before an overflow crowd of about 5,000. ""The Internet is incredibly good at taking money out of existing industries,"" he told the capacity audience of more than 3,000. ""My hope is that the Internet can do for the political process what it did for the copyright industries."" Parker is a backer and board member of Votizen, a site started in 2010 to help users parlay their social networks into political activism. In 2007, he also co-founded Causes, a site that applies similar principles to fundraising for nonprofits and has raised $40 million for over 27,000 organizations. Gore, who in addition to his well-documented environmental activism is a technology investor and founder of Current TV, pointed to recent examples of Web-enabled activism -- from the Web's role in democratic reform in Egypt to successful protests of the Susan G. Komen Foundation after it pulled funding for Planned Parenthood. But he and Parker noted that, in the next generation of Web activism, there needs to be a way to strengthen engagement beyond merely putting a digital signature on an online petition or clicking ""like"" on Facebook. ""It's not enough to take that small action online,"" Parker said. ""A referral or notification is not really the same thing as showing up at a protest or actually opening up your wallet."" While blasting the Supreme Court's ruling in the Citizens United case that allowed for big-money ""super PACs"" in political campaigns -- ""a Supreme Court I have not always agreed with,"" said the 2000 presidential nominee -- Gore said that successful political activism online can decrease the influence of money from special interests. ""When we win the conversation, then the pressure can be put on the politicians and elected officials to do the right thing,"" Gore said. Parker said the way online communities rose up to ultimately derail the Stop Online Piracy Act (which many felt would have clamped down on Web freedom) is heartening, even if he's not sure exactly what form future efforts will take. (He called apathy in tech circles ""somewhat pathetic"" before that, but that SOPA ""awakened that sleeping giant."" ""There are a lot of really smart hackers in this audience,"" Parker said. ""We need to put our heads together and take control of this system ... before the slow-thinking incumbents ... know what's happening.""","Al Gore: 'Our democracy is being hacked' and the Web can help .

"(CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's sister lost her bid for a seat in the nation's parliamentary elections, a result seen as a blow to the controversial leader and, according to one analyst, a ""possible sign of fraud."" Parvin Ahmadinejad, running in her family's hometown of Garmsar, was defeated by a conservative rival in Friday's elections for the Majlis, Iran's parliament, the country's news outlets said Saturday. More than 64 percent of eligible voters streamed to the polls in large numbers, and election officials praised the exercise, in which about 3,400 candidates vied for Majlis seats. It's first time Iranians are voting since allegations of rigging in the 2009 elections triggered mass street protests against President Ahmadinejad's re-election. Many observers say the underlying issue of the election is whether voters back the president, who has been in a rivalry with Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Khamenei publicly supported Ahmadinejad's controversial re-election victory during the dispute over the 2009 ballot results. But tensions have flared between the two leaders over the past year, with Ahmadinejad disappearing from public view for 11 days after the supreme leader overruled his decision to fire an intelligence minister. Several of Ahmadinejad's top political allies have also been subjected to lawsuits and investigations. But in the run-up to this week's vote, the supreme leader urged factions to overcome previous divisions and repeatedly called for unity. The current Majlis speaker, Ali Larijani, and Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the current chairman of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, were re-elected, state media said. Conservatives backing Khamenei or with links to him performed well in the race. One candidate, Gholam Ali Haddad Adel, was overwhelmingly leading his race. His daughter is married to Khamenei's son. But one observer suggested the defeat of the president's sister could be a sign of political fraud. ""In Iran, locals are usually fiercely loyal to high ranking representatives from their area, even if they are unpopular at national level,"" said Meir Javedanfar, an Israeli-Iranian Middle East analyst. ""Although Ahmadinejad is not a popular politician, the very fact that his sister was defeated in Garmsar is a valid possible sign of fraud. This is likely to lead to even more infighting."" Solat Mortazavi, the deputy Interior minister overseeing the elections, praised the polling. ""These have been the most lawful elections,"" he said. ""The elections were conducted in the best possible way."" Mortazavi said it was the first time Iran successfully used computerized voting systems in some polling stations. Final results might be released in a matter of days. He said flooding delayed the retrieval of ballot boxes from remote communities. During the post-election crackdown three years ago, security forces used deadly force to crack down on the opposition Green Movement and presidential candidates Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi were placed under house arrest, where they remain. There were no candidates from the Green Movement in this year's parliamentary election. Iranian political analysts describe the vote as a contest between rival conservative factions within the government. The predominantly Shiite nation faces an escalating international outcry and Western sanctions over its nuclear program, prompting leaders to call for a higher voter turnout to establish legitimacy.","The president's sister was defeated by a conservative .

"(CNN) -- Tjaart van der Walt will seek to upstage two of his most illustrious golfing compatriots and win his first professional tournament at the Africa Open on Sunday. The 37-year-old goes into the final round tied for the lead with 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen and one shot ahead of two-time U.S. Open winner Retief Goosen after carding a superb eight-under-par 65 in East London on Saturday. Van der Walt, who finished second in a 2005 U.S. PGA Tour event, eliminated Oosthuizen's two-shot overnight lead as he started with four successive birdies and -- like his fellow South African -- picked up a shot at the final hole. The world No. 347's only blemish at his home event came at the par-four eighth hole, and he was confident he could contend for his first title since turning pro in 1996 in the opening event of the 2012 European Tour season. ""At the end of the day, the golf ball doesn't know that they are major champions,"" he said of his rivals. ""I've played at the highest level, I've never won majors or big events, so who knows what can happen. ""I do feel as if I am controlling the golf ball as well as I have in a long time. Not just tee to green, but on the greens as well. And that's a good sign for me. I'm entitled to forget the one bad shot I hit all day."" Defending champion Oosthuizen's only lapse came at the par-five 11th hole as he took four shots to reach the green. ""It was an elementary mistake really. Those little chip-outs seem easy, and I made the basic error of leaving it short of a tree for my approach to the green,"" the world No. 40 said. Goosen, seeking his first European Tour win for five years, carded a flawless 66 to be on 20-under 199. The 42-year-old, who topped the tour's Order of Merit money list in 2001 and 2002, was one shot clear of fourth-placed Englishman Danny Willett, who shot 65. Another South African, Richard Sterne, was also in contention after firing seven birdies and an eagle in his 64 to claim fifth place on 202. The 30-year-old, a five-time winner on the tour, is making his first outing in almost a year following back problems. Meanwhile, defending champion Jonathan Byrd claimed a one-shot lead after Friday's first round of the PGA Tour's season-opening Tournament of Champions in Hawaii. The 33-year-old, whose only title last year came in Kapalua, carded six-under 67 on the Plantation Course to lead the 28-man field. Fellow American Webb Simpson, who was runner-up in the 2011 FedEx Cup series and the tour's money list, was equal second with compatriots Steve Stricker and Michael Bradley plus Scotland's Martin Laird. PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley was sixth after a 69, while veteran Korean K.J. Choi carded 70. Lucas Glover, who beat Byrd in a playoff at the Wells Fargo Championship last season, withdrew before his tee-off due to a knee injury suffered while paddleboarding last weekend.","Tjaart van der Walt catches Louis Oosthuzen at the top of the Africa Open leaderboard .

"(CNN) -- One fateful consequence of President Bashar al-Assad's ferocious crackdown on Syrian protesters is the emergence of the domestic armed resistance, the Free Syrian Army. Forged in neighboring Turkey over the summer by military defectors, the FSA has become a major factor in the opposition to the regime. The grass-roots armed resistance is growing, attracting civilians as well as military defectors, and has become a thorn in the side of the Syrian military and the pro-regime militias, observers say. But it needs more personnel, better resources and improved coordination to take on the Syrian security presence, they add. ""The FSA is contributing to the strain on regime forces by requiring them to operate almost continuously and engage in frequent combat,"" said Jeffrey White, a defense fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""This is in addition to the strain created by hundreds of peaceful civilian demonstrations across the country each week. The regime has been compelled to deploy larger forces and conduct more violent operations, increasing both its losses and the international visibility of its actions,"" he said. ""Although attrition of regime personnel is not yet numerically significant, the spectacle of burned-out government vehicles and dead soldiers likely rallies the opposition and decreases morale among regime loyalists."" White made remarks in a January 27 essay titled ""The Free Syrian Army Bleeds the Assad Regime,"" and elaborated on that analysis in an interview Wednesday. He said government operations ""in recent days have pushed the FSA to a lower level of activity."" But he also said the regime ""has not been able to eradicate the FSA in any area."" He said the FSA has been engaged in combat in at least six of the country's 14 provinces -- Idlib, Hama, Homs, Deir Ezzor, Daraa, and Rif Dimashq. Rif Dimashq includes the Damascus suburbs. The fighters have been ""inflicting greater losses on regime personnel and equipment than at any time since its involvement in the uprising began,"" White said. He said about 180 clashes were reported between early November and late January. One-third occurred in Idlib province and about a quarter in Daraa, while clashes have increased in Rif Dimashq. The group has operated openly in places like Idlib province and the cities of Homs, Hama and Zabadani, and it has established control over some small pockets. ""Their most common operations include attacking regime positions (primarily checkpoints), defending demonstrators and local areas, and ambushing regime forces,"" White said. Rebels say they are not getting weapons and money from outside groups. White said most of the weapons are captured or bought from the Syrian military. Some smuggling is reported, he added. The rebels are getting better armed, with more and better antitank weapons, and the number of defections is growing, White said. The FSA's acquisition of advanced antitank weapons is to date ""the most significant arms development,"" he said. It claims to have used an RPG-29, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, to destroy an infantry fighting vehicle in Daraa. ""Several videos suggest it has guided antitank missiles as well,"" White said. ""It seems to have no shortage of small arms and light crew-served weapons, including assault rifles, medium machine guns, standard rocket-propelled grenades, and scoped/sniper rifles. The FSA also claims to be employing improvised explosive devices against regime vehicles, and videos have corroborated this. In addition, it has begun using vehicles for tactical troop movement, equipped with improvised armor and machine guns."" There have been a number of cases of soldiers defecting with armored vehicles, he said. The FSA claimed to have as many as 40,000 personnel. White said 4,000 to 7,000 is a ""more reasonable estimate"" but there has been a ""substantial increase"" from November. He said the size of group defections is growing, from the five to 20 people to platoon-sized defections of 30 or so people. There are 38 named battalions in the FSA, some more closely associated with the central command than others, White said. While there is guidance from FSA headquarters, there appears to be no day-to-day control. White said FSA battalions appear to be fighting alone and haven't yet shown ""they can coordinate operations on a regional basis."" ""Essentially these battalions are largely independent operations. There's no substructure underneath the FSA command in Turkey that operates the battalions,"" he said. ""It is unclear to what extent the FSA's command in Turkey exercises real control over operations, other than providing general guidance. It is also uncertain how much freedom of action Turkey allows these commanders. This means that FSA units are essentially conducting independent actions while the regime conducts coordinated operations."" Civilians have been joining FSA units because of the ""synergy"" between the resistance group and the populace, he said. Some civilians are locals who simply link up with battalions and there may be local defense groups forming under the Free Syrian Army banner. ""Some of these groups may have civilians who joined them. My sense is that the core, the primary combat forces, are coming from defectors,"" he said. The group is also working to develop closer relations with the Syrian National Council, the political opposition. While coordinating operations is one challenge for the FSA, others are cohesion and military limitations. News of a power struggle has emerged in recent days between FSA head Col. Riad al Assad and a general, Mustapha Sheikh, forming a rival Higher Military Council. Another group, the Al Faroukh Battalion, said it is operating outside the control of both groups. FSA Lt. Col. Mohamed Hamado told CNN that ""many of the officers fighting on the ground have pledged allegiance"" to Sheikh. ""They operate from the Turkish/Syrian borders at the refugee camps, while we are fighting on the ground and are very organized,"" he said. White said any rift wouldn't help them but it's not having an effect on combat. It would have a greater effect if a world player decided it wanted to funnel money to the fighters. U.S. lawmakers such as Sen. John McCain said Washington should consider arming such rebels. White said it wouldn't surprise him if international clandestine services are feeling out the FSA to see ""what they are made of,"" but there's no solid evidence of any outside help. Hamado said that despite the FSA's efforts ""it cannot defeat Assad's army with the weapons he is using. He has escalated his attacks by using helicopters, rocket launchers and mortars."" The Syrian regime is dominated by the Alawite minority. The Syrian opposition has a large Sunni component. Hamado said there are concerns that among world powers that arms would fall into the hands of Islamists. ""The international community is reluctant to donate weapons because the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood is highly represented"" in the Syrian National Council. While Syrian militants wait for outside help, Hamado said the regime has backing from outside entities -- Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in Syria. ""We have captured Iranian fighters from the Revolutionary Guard and broadcast the videos showing the weapons they used to refute claims that they were technicians. Many civilians and eyewitnesses gave testimonials about Iranians storming into their homes during the searches and arrests along with Assad's army recruits."" Based in Latakia, on the coast, Hamado said, he has seen signs of the Hezbollah modus operandi. ""What we know for sure is that the regime is digging trenches around Latakia coast just the same way they are dug in southern Lebanon, which is controlled by Hezbollah. Assad's Army has installed rocket launchers in the mountains of Latakia and are in a process of setting up a self-sustained region similar to the Hezbollah establishment in Lebanon, in order to have a base after Assad falls,"" Hamado said. Aram Nerguizian, visiting fellow with Burke chair in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that despite some operational and tactical victories in the provinces of Idlib, Hama and Homs and in some Damascus suburbs, the Syrian military ""continues to control many key checkpoints leading to rebel-held neighborhoods and districts."" The FSA needs ""better organization, leadership, command and control and more military personnel and hardware"" to compete with the government's ""security apparatus"" and resilient military. Nerguizian said its manpower is in the low thousands and ""there are few indications that the force has been able to establish a clear chain of command."" He added that ""elements of the armed opposition seem to be operating outside the umbrella of the FSA and cities like Homs and Hama have seen the emergence of home-grown armed groups or militias intent on defending their neighborhoods against the crackdown."" While there have been defections, he said, ""there seems to have been far more outright desertions than shifts of forces to the FSA."" As for Syrian military leaders, they back the regime because of fear of reprisals if al-Assad's rule ends and their ""deep aversion to prolonged instability."" But the prospect of a split in the military could be a good sign for the resistance forces. ""While the Syrian military needed time to absorb the shock of mounting internal opposition, it now appears to be on the offensive and it is likely to remain critical to the survival of the Assad regime. Should it experience real divisions in the future, the FSA may be able to take advantage,"" Nerguizian said. CNN's Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta. Journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy reported from Cairo.","The Free Syrian Army was formed last summer by military defectors .

"Woodward, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Paul Lord's home is a shambles, and a large bandage is draped across his head -- not from four previous brain surgeries he had endured but from the plywood that smacked him, while he was outside trying to warn a family across the street about a coming tornado. And yet Sunday, the Woodward, Oklahoma, resident was all about giving thanks. Thankful for the neighbors who, after the twister slammed through his and other homes, had rushed over and picked up the washer and driver sitting atop his grandson. Another grandson had been blown away from the house, only to be found with two big cuts on his arm. Lord also expressed appreciation for staff at Woodward Regional Hospital who, he said, had treated him and his family with a minimum of paperwork and maximum of caring and expertise. Tornado threats from Arkansas to Minnesota . And lastly, he gestured to those working feverishly behind him -- some of them neighbors, some strangers -- to clear the rubble. ""We are truly blessed. God saved us, and that's what it's about,"" Lord said. Following an earlier bout of severe weather, the tornado barreled through Woodward just after midnight Sunday. Compounding the fact it struck at such a late hour, the high winds ""took out"" the transmitter for the public siren and tornado notification system, and ""we lost our manual override"" when the electricity was knocked out, City Manager Alan Riffel said -- meaning there was no warning system. ""It caught us asleep, mostly,"" Mayor Roscoe Hill told CNN. Afterward, it was learned that five people in Woodward -- a community of about 12,000 people about 85 miles west of Enid and not far from the Panhandle -- had died as a result. While the powerful system hit a hospital, blew truckers off highways and shredded buildings in several states, Woodward was the only place where fatalities were reported over the weekend. They include Frank Hobbie, who died along with two girls -- presumed to be his 5- and 7-year-old daughters -- according to state medical examiner's spokesman Amy Elliot. Hill earlier said that a father and his two children were inside a trailer at the Hidden Valley Mobile Home Park when the tornado rolled through and killed them. Elliot identified one of the other dead as Derrin Juul. A 10-year-old girl who was found with him is thought to be Juul's daughter. Hill had said that two people died when the car they were in rolled over several times. Still, given the power and timing of the storm, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin said late Sunday afternoon that she believes it is ""remarkable that we didn't have more loss of life in Woodward."" Fallin detailed some survival stories from the small city. One man was lying asleep on his sofa, with his dog beside him, when the tornado came through, Fallin said. The intense winds picked up him and his sofa and dumped him behind his house. But except for some scrapes, he escaped unscathed. The governor also recalled how a woman described hunkering down with her family, wrapping her arms around her pregnant daughter, as the twister approached. Afterward, the daughter was rushed to a nearby hospital where her baby was delivered, safely by cesarean section, according to Fallin. Lord was a survivor long before this weekend's storms, having undergone two heart procedures in addition to his four brain surgeries. His latest wound, a big gash to his head, was stitched back up early Sunday. He said he did not initially notice it, as he rushed to get his grandson to the hospital even before he'd located his wife of 43 years. Hours later, Lord was back where his home once stood. People young and old were working hard nearby, tossing debris, cutting through wood with chainsaws and otherwise trying to bring order to the chaos caused by the tornado. ""This is Woodward, Oklahoma,"" said Lord. ""We're here to take care of each other ... We're truly blessed in so many ways, and one of them is to live here."" As to what what treasured mementos he hopes to find among the wreckage, Lord said he already had everything he needed. ""I found them. My son, my daughter, my son-in-law, my grandbabies, my wife,"" he said. ""Everything else is brick and stick, and they're all easily replaced."" CNN's Rich Phillips and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Paul Lord and his family survive after a tornado tears through his home .

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un spoke before hundreds of troops and others in Pyongyang on Sunday as part of a massive, orchestrated celebration marking 100 years since the birth of the nation's founder, his grandfather. Kim's address was his first televised speech since assuming the country's leadership. The remarks, which touched on a number of issues including the significance of North Korea's military, regularly stirred applause from the crowd. ""Our military has become a powerful military capable of handling any kind of modern warfare, with complete offensive and defensive tactics,"" Kim said. ""The foreign powers are not the only ones with military supremacy anymore. And the days of their threatening and lying to us with atomic weapons is forever gone."" Kim also vowed never to let the country starve. ""Our fellow citizens, who are the best citizens in the world, who have overcome countless struggles and hardships, it is our party's firmest resolve not to let our citizens go hungry again,"" he said. Much of Kim's roughly 20-minute talk focused on the importance of the revolution spearheaded by his grandfather, saying that it was the North Korean government's responsibility to work to realize the movement's aspirations and live up to its values. Deemed the Eternal President, Kim's grandfather -- Kim Il Sung -- was born on August 15, 1912. Some 33 years later, following North Korea's liberation from Japan, he pledged in Pyongyang to build a nation on wealth, strength and knowledge. The grandson, Kim Jong Un, is now North Korea's ""supreme commander"" -- a title he has recently assumed, following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il. Elaborate and extensive 100th anniversary celebrations of Kim Il Sung's birth have been in the works for years. One of those milestones was the Friday launch of a long-range rocket -- a move deplored by the United States and many others in the international community, even after it prematurely broke apart and failed to escape the Earth's atmosphere. On Sunday, state TV showed video of large blocks of North Korean troops as they marched in tight formation. Music was interspersed at times by coordinated chants, while military officials could be seen saluting from vehicles that drove past tanks lined up in the square.","Kim Jong Un touts the importance of the revolution begun by his grandfather .

"(CNN) -- The European Union is dialing up the pressure on Iran, saying Monday it will cut off oil imports and freeze assets in an effort to starve the country's nuclear program of funding. ""Today's action demonstrates the EU's growing concern about Iran's nuclear programme, and our determination to increase peaceful, legitimate pressure on Iran to return to negotiations,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement from Brussels, Belgium. The sanctions freeze the assets of Iran's central bank in European Union nations and ban the importation of Iranian oil to those countries. The measures also block European Union countries from exporting petrochemical equipment and technology to Iran, or trading diamonds and precious metals with the Middle Eastern state. The sanctions are necessary because Iran continues to defy United Nations resolutions regarding its nuclear program, Hague said. ""Iran has it in its power to end sanctions by changing course and addressing the concerns of the international community,"" he said. Saudi prince: Why Iran won't close Strait of Hormuz . U.S. officials welcomed the sanctions, with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying in a joint statement Monday that the new measures will ""sharpen the choice for Iran's leaders."" But Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Aragchi, said the measures will only harm the fragile economies of the European Union, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. ""Sanctions have proved ineffective in the past and will prove futile in the future, too,"" IRNA quoted Aragchi as saying. The U.S. government took its own punitive action regarding Iran on Monday, with the Treasury Department targeting the nation's third-largest bank, the state-owned Bank Tejarat, for allegedly working with other Iranian banks and firms subject to sanctions tied to Iran's nuclear program. Read a summary of sanctions against Iran . This step means ""all of Iran's largest state-owned banks have been sanctioned by the U.S. based on their involvement in Iran's illicit activities,"" according to a statement from the U.S. government department. David S. Cohen, the U.S. Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, called Bank Tejarat -- which has nearly 2,000 branches in Iran, plus branches in France and Takijistan -- ""one of Iran's few remaining access points to the international financial system. ""Today's sanction against Bank Tejarat will deepen Iran's financial isolation, make its access to hard currency even more tenuous, and further impair Iran's ability to finance its illicit nuclear program,"" said Cohen. The International Atomic Energy Agency said shortly after the fresh oil sanctions were announced that officials from the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency will visit Iran January 29 to 31 ""to resolve all outstanding substantive issues."" How sanctions hit ordinary Iranians . Inspectors are in and out of the country regularly, an agency spokeswoman said Monday, but a high-level visit of the kind taking place at the end of the month is more unusual. Top officials in Israel, which fears it would be a target of an Iranian nuclear weapon, welcomed the sanctions. ""This is a step in the right direction. ... Heavy and swift pressure on Iran is needed,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, even as he warned that it is impossible to know what would come of the measures. ""For now, Iran continues to produce nuclear weapons without disturbance,"" he said. Defense Minister Ehud Barak called the EU move ""highly important,"" saying it set ""a new standard for the sanctions like never before."" Iran exports 2.2. million barrels of oil a day, with about 18% bound for European markets, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The world consumes about 89 million barrels of oil per day. The European Union will allow contracts that are already in place to be fulfilled until July 1, it said. Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi told CNN last week that his country could make up the difference if Iran was banned from exporting oil. Al-Naimi said the country has a spare capacity ""to respond to emergencies worldwide, to respond to our customer demand, and that is really the focus. Our focus is not on who drops out from production, but who wants more."" Tehran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the only outlet to and from the Persian Gulf, as it faces possible sanctions. The United States has made clear it will not let that happen. Iran: Stuck between U.S. and a hard place . Seventeen million barrels of oil per day passed through the critical shipping lane in 2011, according to the Energy Information Administration. The Iranian government gets about half its revenue from oil exports, according to the agency. Analysts have said that while the new sanctions are the toughest ever imposed, they still contain many loopholes. Iran is expected to still be able to sell its oil to places like China, India or other Asian countries, but perhaps at a discount of 10% to 15%. About 35% of Iran's oil exports currently go to China and India. Western leaders have been walking a fine line with Iran, working to come up with a plan that squeezes the country's finances yet doesn't result in a loss of Iranian oil exports, which could send crude and gasoline prices skyrocketing. The United States and United Kingdom have already put new measures in place against Iran, and Washington has been pressing allies, including Japan and South Korea, to stop buying Iranian oil. U.S. carrier defies Hormuz threat . On Friday, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton challenged Iran to respond to an offer she made in a letter last October. Ashton wrote that world powers are open to negotiations if Iran is serious about addressing its nuclear program without preconditions. Her office released the letter on Friday. Ashton's spokesperson pointedly noted, ""We are waiting for the Iranian reaction."" Ashton wrote that the West wants to ""engage in a confidence-building exercise"" that would lead to a ""constructive dialogue"" and a ""step by step approach"" in which Iran would assure the international community that its nuclear program is peaceful. Clinton told reporters in Washington that ""we stand by that letter."" ""They have to give up their nuclear weapons program ... and they have to be willing to come to the table with a plan to do that,"" she said. Clinton made the comments Friday after a meeting at the State Department with German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. The German minister was blunt in his assessment of Iran's actions: ""Tehran keeps violating its international obligations on the transparency of its nuclear program. We have no choice but to pass tough new sanctions that address the financial sources of the nuclear program."" Iran says its nuclear program is not military, but the United States and many of its allies suspect Iran intends to produce a bomb. The International Atomic Energy Agency has expressed similar concerns. ""One thing is clear,"" Westerwelle added. ""The door for serious dialogue remains open, but the option of nuclear weapons in Iran is not acceptable to both of us.""

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Two Turkish journalists who were covering news and shooting a documentary in Syria are missing, Turkey's Milat newspaper said Wednesday. Adem Ozkose, a columnist and war reporter for Milat and the Middle East correspondent for Gercek Hayat magazine, was working for both publications in Syria, the newspaper said in a statement.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- The U.S. Embassy in Kenya warned it has credible information of an imminent terror attack, days after the east African nation announced it is sending troops to Somalia to battle Islamist militants. The attack is likely to target places that foreigners congregate in Kenya, including malls and night clubs, the embassy said. The U.S.Embassy did not offer details on who might carry out such an attack, but said it has taken measures to limit official U.S. government visits. It urged its citizens to consider deferring travel to Kenya. The warning comes after Kenya sent troops across the border into Somalia to pursue Islamist Al-Shabaab militants. The terror group has threatened Kenya with retaliatory attacks, saying it considers the forces' incursion an affront to Somalia's sovereignty. Al-Shabaab, which is linked to al Qaeda and has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, is fighting to impose its own interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia, on Somalia. Kenya has blamed some recent abductions of tourists and aid workers on the terror group, which has heightened tensions. On September 11, armed bandits broke into a beachfront cottage where Britons Judith and David Tebbutt, both in their 50s, were staying. David Tebbutt was shot dead while trying to resist the attack. His wife was grabbed and spirited away on a speedboat, and is believed to have been taken into Somalia. On October 1, pirates made another cross-border raid, this time snatching a French woman in her 60s, who used a wheelchair and was believed to be in bad health, from a holiday home on Manda Island where she lived part of the year. She later died, likely because of the kidnappers' refusal to give her medicine, according to the French Foreign Ministry. Also this month, gunmen abducted two Spanish workers from the medical charity Doctors Without Borders from the Dadaab refugee complex, about 80 kilometers (about 50 miles) from the Somali border. Al-Shabaab has denied responsibility for the abductions.","The embassy urges citizens to consider deferring travel .

"(CNN)  -- When 12-year-old Mason went to lunch each day last year, he could choose between orange juice and milk, but he couldn't get a cup of water. Like many public schools, his doesn't provide cups. To have free water with his lunch, Mason would have to wait in line at a water fountain shared by hundreds of other middle-school students and take a few sips of water before returning to eat. Not surprisingly, he usually didn't bother. His mother, Johanna Whittlesey, like other parents across the country, assumed her child had enough water, but nutrition advocates believe schoolchildren's access to water is a national problem the federal government has only begun to address. Fifteen percent of kids in Mason's age group consume adequate amounts of water, according to the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. ""Since children spend a large percent of their waking hours at school, they should be consuming at least one-half their total water intake at school,"" says Dr. Melina Jampolis, CNNHealth's Diet and Fitness Expert. ""The standard recommendations are for children to get 6-8 glasses of water per day. Teenage boys need even more, 11 glasses per day,"" she says. ""Mild dehydration can affect learning as well as mental and physical performance."" Change you can drink . Last year Michelle Obama continued with her ""Let's Move!"" campaign to target childhood obesity, former military leaders warned that obesity could be a threat to national security and the ABC series ""Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution"" attempted to show Americans what their children are eating in school. On the heels of those headlines, Congress passed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 in December to improve school nutrition in the National School Lunch Program. The legislation requires that clean water be easily available in school. Advocates welcome the new legislation but say it's not clear if the new rules will go far enough to address the lack of hydration. According to the new federal law, school districts will have to provide water in student eating areas, but the law doesn't discuss accessibility. Vista Middle School outside Los Angeles has approximately 1,700 students and four water fountains in the student eating area. It's still to be decided if a school with those numbers -- 1,700 students, four water fountains and a 30-minute mealtime -- satisfies the new legislation. ""As part of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, the USDA will be engaging in a dialogue with schools and communities as we develop a proposed rule to implement this provision of the law,"" the USDA says. Where we are now . Schools face a variety of challenges when trying to provide something -- water -- that Americans take for granted. One such challenge: drinking cups. Advocates say, and many educators admit, that too many of America's largest school districts elect not to provide cups. Chicago Public Schools do not. Miami-Dade County Public Schools do not. Newark Public Schools do not. Atlanta Public Schools do not. Clark County School District in Nevada does not. Broward County Public Schools, in Fort Lauderdale, says drinking cups aren't provided unless a student asks for one. In the New York City Department of Education, the largest school district in the country by number of students, cups are ""generally available to all students,"" but spokesperson Margie Feinberg cannot say in which of its schools cups are available only upon request. Hillsborough County school district in Tampa says it does not provide cups of water and there is usually one water fountain in student eating areas. Educators say that providing cups can get expensive and take too much of their already dwindling school budgets. Another issue is the water fountains themselves. Some schools, advocates say, don't have enough to handle the number of students. At other schools, the fountains are old, don't work or work poorly. According to the California Food Policy Advocates, filling cups is ""likely a slow process at most water fountains."" Other barriers to student hydration include poor-tasting water and fears that municipal tap water is not safe. Sitting down with water . ""Water fountains aren't providing adequate hydration,"" says Matt Sharp, senior advocate of the California Food Policy Advocates. ""When have you ever gone to a restaurant and been encouraged to go to a water fountain for a sip between bites of your meal?"" The UCLA/RAND Center for Adolescent Health Promotion, a CDC-funded prevention research program, has been test-driving a way to get children drinking more water at mealtime to help combat America's obesity epidemic. It's called a water intervention -- a five-week research program that includes a water filter and cups for five schools in the Los Angeles school district, provided free from the UCLA/RAND project. The test includes these steps: Install a water filter in the school. Fill five-gallon jugs. Chill jugs overnight. Place in the eating area during mealtime. Serve with cups. The results will not be published until next year, but anecdotally, the program is a success, researchers say. ""We've seen students really gravitate towards the water out here and fill up their cups right before and after lunch to hydrate"" says Burt Cowgill, the project manager. ""The water is very popular and we have a lot of participation."" Now that the research has ended, it's up to the school district to continue funding if it so chooses, but the Los Angeles Unified School District says it cannot afford the estimated $1.8 million to $2.3 million annually it says it would cost to provide the cups and water for the entire district. Free drinking water and cups could also decrease revenue from bottled water sales. ""If students drink free water served at school instead of purchasing competitive beverages that fund extracurricular activities, schools may have to seek alternative fundraising strategies,"" said a report published in the journal Preventing Chronic Disease. The report was based on CDC-funded researchers' interviews with school personnel and families, primarily within the Los Angeles school system. Research shows that making water more accessible to children at school increases consumption of water and improves health. Researchers in Germany found that by installing a cooled, filtered water fountain with plain or optionally carbonated water, providing children with water bottles, educating them on the importance of drinking water and encouraging them to fill up their water bottles, they were able to reduce the risk of children becoming overweight by 31%. Those children were allowed to store their water bottles at school. When children have to take their water bottles home, they start forgetting to bring them back, and water consumption declines, according to a pilot program in a Los Angeles school. What the school district wants . David Binkle, deputy director of Los Angeles school district food services, would like the federal government to help pay for water instead of only mandating that water be made available. When schools serve children milk, they receive money from the federal government reimbursing them for that milk; when schools serve orange juice, the same. But water is not a reimbursable beverage, either from the tap or from bottles. Binkle says that has to change. ""It's an unfunded mandate,"" says Binkle. ""If the federal government let us offer water as part of a reimbursable meal, then the children, many of them, instead of taking a milk or juice, would take a water."" Cindy Garcia, an eighth-grader at Vista Middle School, says having free water available in cups during the UCLA/RAND research program changed her drinking habits. ""I wouldn't really drink water because it's sort of hard to be eating your meal and then stop and go drink water at the water fountain,"" she said. ""Before, I would just drink whatever they have at the cafeteria, like juice or milk, and now I drink water in the cups that's available."" The 'Good Old Days,' updated . Students have been drinking water from water fountains for decades, but research shows that children are not getting enough water throughout the day. ""Water maybe has always been insufficiently available, but schools have a unique and special responsibility to create an environment that makes it easy for students to make good choices,"" says Sharp of the California Food Policy Advocates. ""The environment has changed in so many ways in recent decades, sweetened beverages are cheap and widely available and heavily promoted, family mealtimes are fewer, and briefer, and convenience foods are a much more common part of youngsters' routines."" At Vista Middle School, Principal Nidia Castro says she will do her best to keep cups of water in her school, even suggesting she might pay out-of-pocket to provide cups for her students. She wouldn't be the first school administrator to provide school supplies from her own wallet. ""I see how much the kids really like the water,"" she says. ""It is documented that if we provide the choices for them they will really go for it.""","Parents assume water at their kids' schools is a given, but access is a problem .

"(CNN) -- Ethiopia's Deriba Merga forgot his Olympic disappointment when he won Monday's 113th Boston Marathon ahead of Kenyan Daniel Rono and Ryan Hall of America. Deriba Merga celebrates after winning the men's division of the 113th running of the Boston marathon. Merga, who faded in the heat of Beijing to finish fourth in the 2008 Summer Games, went clear before 'Heartbreak Hill' and finished almost a minute clear in two hours eight minutes 42 seconds. Rono clocked 2:09.32 with Hall another eight seconds adrift and the only non-African competitor in a top 10 that included five Kenyans headed by Rono and with Robert Cheruiyot finishing fifth. Kenya's Salina Kosgei took the women's title by just one second in a relatively slow time of two hours 32 minutes 16 seconds -- with all the drama reserved for the last few strides. Kosgei outsprinted Ethiopia's Dire Tune, who collapsed after finishing and required medical attention. Tune won last year in a similar sprint finish and was treated for several minutes before being taken to a local hospital as a precaution. American Kara Goucher, who led with a mile to go, faded and finished third in 2:32.25 with Bezunesh Bekele of Ethiopia fourth. The Boston Marathon is the oldest established race over the classic 26.2 miles (42km) distance and has been won over the years by many of the leading names in the sport. The famous 'Heartbreak Hill' comes 20 miles (32km) into the race and often decides the final outcome.","Ethiopia's Deriba Merga won Monday's 113th Boston Marathon in 2:08.42 .

"(CNN) -- Usain Bolt ensured the world athletics championships in Daegu ended on a high by leading Jamaica to a stunning world record in the final of the men's 4x100m relay on Sunday. Exactly a week after Bolt's shock disqualification from the final of the 100 meters, the sprint superstar once again underlined his superiority as he carried the baton home in a time of 37.04 seconds, bettering the Jamaican squad's previous world record set in the final of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The quartet of Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, new 100m champion Yohan Blake and Bolt were pressed three-quarters of the way by a strong United States team. Dominant Bolt claims 200m gold in Daegu . However, a bizarre incident on the final changeover saw American third leg runner Darvis Patton crash to the ground after colliding with Harry Aikines-Aryeetey -- who was running the Great Britain anchor leg -- ruling out both teams. This meant Bolt was out on his own as powered down the finishing straight, with France claiming a distant silver medal and the tiny Caribbean nation of St Kitts and Nevis winning an unexpected bronze medal. Bolt, who was celebrating his second gold in 24 hours after retaining his world 200m title, normally runs the third leg for the Jamaican team, but Asafa Powell's injury forced him to miss the championships, meaning he was switched to the anchor leg. ""I enjoyed being the anchor but for me it was just to go out there and be fast,"" Bolt told reporters. ""We did just that. I am proud of my team and I'm very happy with myself,"" added the 25-year-old, who celebrated in his own unique style by leading his teammates through a series of dance moves in front of a delighted crowd. But there was some consolation for the United States sprinters as the women's squad took gold ahead of Jamaica in the women's 4x100m relay, with Ukraine taking the bronze medal. There was a surprise result in the men's triple jump where American Christian Taylor recorded the fourth largest jump of all time to pip Britain's defending champion Phillips Idowu. The 21-year-old recorded 17.96 meters with his fourth attempt to leave Idowu in second place on 17.77m. Another American, Will Claye, claimed bronze. There was a thrilling finish in the final of the men's 5,000m where Britain's Mo Farah made up for the disappointment of being caught on the line in the 10,000m by securing his first-ever gold medal in a major championships. Farah was pushed hard by 2007 champion Bernard Lagat, but he held on to finish 0.28 seconds ahead of the American. Ethiopia's Dejen Gebremeskel took bronze after his compatriot Imane Merga was disqualified for stepping inside the curb. Russia's Mariya Savinova denied South African Caster Semenya a second consecutive women's 800m title, with a devastating finishing kick. Savinova, the reigning world indoor and European champion, was the favorite coming into the event, and she justified that tag by coming from near the back of the pack at the 600m mark to clinch the gold medal in a time of one minute 55.87 seconds. Semenya took silver with Kenya's 2007 champion Janeth Jepkosgei claiming bronze. The men's marathon title went to Kenya's Abel Kirui, who finished nearly two-and-a-half minutes ahead of his team-mate Vincent Kipruto -- the biggest winning margin in world championship history. Ethiopia's Feyisa Lilesa took bronze. The final day of competition confirmed the United States at the top of the medal table with 12 golds, ahead of Russia with nine and Kenya on seven.","Jamaica set a new world record in the final of the men's 4x100m relay in Daegu .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel led home teammate Mark Webber as Red Bull claimed a 1-2 in the Malaysian Grand Prix on Sunday. Red Bull have claimed all three pole positions so far this season, with German Vettel heading the grid in the first two races and Webber starting first at Sepang, but had been hit by reliability issues priot to Sunday's race. However, they finally got their reward this time around, with Vettel outpacing his Australian colleague after the first lap, holding on for a comfortable victory. Formula One standings after three races . ""It was a great race for us and a great result for the team after the last two races when we just didn't get the results we wanted,"" Vettel told reporters. Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg claimed third place -- although it proved another disappointing race for seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher who was forced to quit the race early because of suspension problems. The grid had a lop-sided look to it due to Saturday's dramatic qualifying session which was hit by heavy rain. This meant the two dominant teams, Ferrari and McLaren, were both towards the rear of the field as the race began and had to weave their way through slower cars in order to get amongst the top 10 for some world championship points. McLaren's former world champion Lewis Hamilton drove superbly to battle his way to sixth position, after starting 20th, while Ferrari's Felipe Massa finished seventh and current world champion Jenson Button was eighth. Meanwhile, Bahrain GP winner Fernando Alonso, who led the championship going into the race, saw his race ended on the penultimate lap due to an engine problem with his Ferrari -- after he had tried to overtake Button. With Alonso failing to finish in the top 10, therefore missing out on world championship points, Massa's seventh-placed finish proved enough for him to steal the overall lead from his Ferrari teammate . The Brazilian, who has returned to F1 this season after suffering head injuries in an horrific crash last season, lies on 39 points, two ahead of Alonso and Vettel who are tied for second place. But this season promises to be one of the closest ever with only nine points separating the top seven after three different winners -- Alonso, Button and Vettel -- in the first three races.","Sebastian Vettel beats Red Bull teammate Mark Webber to win Malaysian GP .

"(CNN) -- Flanked by British and French ships, the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier moved through the Strait of Hormuz without incident Sunday despite recent threats from Iran. The U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said in a statement that the Lincoln ""completed a regular and routine transit of the strait ... to conduct maritime security operations."" The Lincoln is in the region with the USS Carl Vinson, giving the U.S. Navy its standard two-carrier presence there.

""Britain maintains a constant presence in the region as part of our enduring contribution to Gulf security,"" the spokesman said. Several weeks ago, as the USS John Stennis left the Persian Gulf and headed back to the western Pacific, Iranian officials warned the United States not to send in another carrier. ""We have always stated that there is no need for the forces belonging to the countries beyond this region to have a presence in the Persian Gulf,"" Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said in early January, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. ""Their presence does nothing but create mayhem, and we never wanted them to be present in the Persian Gulf."" Tehran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the only outlet to and from the Persian Gulf between Iran and the United Arab Emirates as well as Oman, as Iran faces increased scrutiny over its nuclear program and possible sanctions on its oil exports.

U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has responded by threatening to ""respond"" if Iran attempts to shut down traffic. He said that the U.S. naval and military presence in the region will not change and the current level is sufficient to deal with any situation that could arise. ""We have always maintained a very strong presence in that region,"" Panetta said earlier this month. ""We have a Navy fleet located there. We have a military presence in that region.

"(CNN) -- The death toll from bushfires in southeastern Australia has risen to 208, the Australian Red Cross said Thursday. Forensic teams sift through the remains of a house in Pheasant Creek, north of Melbourne. Four fires are still burning across the state of Victoria, a spokeswoman with the Country Fire Authority said. All are under control, but one of the fires spawned a smaller blaze that is actively burning, said the spokeswoman, who asked not to be named, in line with policy. That fire is burning in the area of Narbethong, about an hour north of Melbourne. ""Two communities are in that area, we suspect they may be directly impacted by that particular fire,"" the spokeswoman said. ""Residents in that area are being asked to action their fire plans."" The Red Cross said it has teams in 13 locations across Victoria to help with first aid, food, and personal support. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced a national day of mourning Sunday to honor the victims of the bushfires and recognize the efforts of emergency workers. ""This day will give all Australians the chance to reflect and remember this terrible tragedy as an important step in rebuilding these communities,"" he said in a statement. The fires have destroyed more than 1,800 homes and displaced about 7,000 people. At the height of the fires, about three dozen separate blazes were burning. A suspect, 39-year-old Brendan Sokaluk, has been arrested on suspicion of setting one of the fatal fires. Sokaluk is suspected of lighting a fire on February 7. He has been charged with arson causing death, intentionally or recklessly lighting a bush fire, and possessing child pornography, Victoria state police said.

"(CNN) -- The White House indicated Wednesday that a report and a photo from the controversial low-altitude New York flyover by a 747 plane used as Air Force One could be released soon. A 911 caller on the day of the flyover said, ""There's a plane falling. There is a big aircraft falling like 9/11."" Earlier, White House officials had said that there were no plans to release photos to the public. But the tone seemed to change on Wednesday. ""The report, I believe, will be concluded at some point this week. We'll release its findings and release a photo,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said during his daily press briefing. The review, led by Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina, will focus on ""why that decision was made and to ensure that it never happens again,"" Gibbs said. The flyover, officials said, was a training mission -- it was also a government-sanctioned photo shoot. Military officials also estimate that the mission and the photo shoot, aimed at updating file photos of Air Force One -- cost $328,835 in taxpayer money. But they said ""the hours would have been flown regardless, and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission."" The photo shoot, which President Obama said he was ""furious"" with, happened on April 27. The image of a low-flying plane accompanied by an F-16 fighter jet sent some New Yorkers into the streets and into a panic -- reminding them of the tragic 9/11 attacks on the city. Building evacuations also took place across the Hudson River in Jersey City, New Jersey. Read more of Obama's reaction . White House Military Office Director Louis Caldera later apologized for the flyover.

A 911 call, released later by the Hudson County Sheriff's Department in New Jersey, illustrated the fear and panic felt by residents since the 9/11 attacks. ""There's a plane falling. There is a big aircraft falling like 9/11,"" a man says to the operator. ""Everybody is running and people are crying and panicking."" CNN iReporter Tom Kruk, who saw the plane and took a photo, called the sight of the aircraft low in the sky ""unsettling."" Mayor Michael Bloomberg was visibly angry last week. ""I'm annoyed -- furious is a better word -- that I wasn't told,"" he said, adding that the decision by the White House Military Office and Federal Aviation Administration to withhold details about the flight were ""ridiculous"" and ""poor judgment."" But according to Air Force Capt. Anna Carpenter, local law enforcement agencies and the FAA had been notified of the exercise. New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne confirmed that department had been alerted about the flight ""with directives to local authorities not to disclose information about it."" That decision riled local media. ""Given that we are not big on reminders of 9/11, we could have done without the whole thing. But the FAA outdunced itself by asking the NYPD to keep the photo op a secret, as if no one would look up and say, 'What the hell?' "" the New York Daily News said on April 28. The New York Post, in its editorial on the same day, said: ""The FAA had long preferred to keep passengers ignorant of these dangers. Better to have people panic, it seems, at the sudden sight of low-flying aircraft over Lower Manhattan. ... Someone needs to straighten out these folks -- quick."" The controversy had some questioning President Obama's declaration of a new era of openness, who on January 21, said: ""The old rules said that if there was a defensible argument for not disclosing something to the American people, then it should not be disclosed. That era is now over."" So why, exactly, didn't that initially apply to the photos? An advocate for government disclosure said it should, and that it's ""silly"" and ""absurd"" to withhold them.

"(CNN) -- Nine-year-old Mahmood Ahmed was playing near his home in Zintan, western Libya, when he found a green object he had never seen before. He wanted to know what was inside, so took it into his backyard and began hitting it with a stone. The object was a bullet from an anti-aircraft machine gun and it exploded, taking off his left hand. He is now getting used to life with a plastic hand. Mahmood is one of the accidental child victims of the war that toppled Colonel Moammar Gadhafi in August and he is far from alone. The International charity Mines Advisory Group (MAG), which highlighted his case, has recorded 90 casualties -- mostly children -- from similar accidents involving mines and unexploded ordinance left over from the war in the region of Zintan and Misrata alone this year. The organization also recorded 45 casualties in Libya's Western Mountains and is still trying to gather data from accidents in the rest of the country. Among the statistics were several members of the same family in Ajdabiya in June. Three-year-old Shada Yonis brought a hand grenade into the living room and pulled out the pin. Her father, Yonis Sala, who tried to shield his children, was killed, as was Shada, and five-year-old Shema. Her mother, eight-year-old brother Sulah and two other children were seriously injured. Two children were killed on Saturday, December 10, in Sirte when a device exploded as people were compiling a museum of weaponry from the war, MAG said. As well as gaining information on contaminated areas and clearing them, MAG is trying to educate communities on the dangers. Libyans find voice in new era of press freedom . Louise Skilling, the group's regional community liaison manager, said: ""There is a lot of contamination in houses and residential areas. ""Accidents are mainly involving children -- particularly teenage boys -- who don't understand the danger of handling items. ""We are trying to change behavior among young boys and the best way to do that is through their mothers. ""We are working through schools, women's groups and door-to-door in contaminated areas. "" She added: ""The number of accidents has increased since the war ended because people who were displaced are returning to their homes and trying to get their lives back together. ""A lot of accidents are happening in or close to homes as people try to clear the damage."" Other organizations are also working to raise awareness of the weapons that children mistake for toys. Mohamed Khalifa Kanah, a volunteer for the Libyan Red Crescent in Nalut, one of 30 branches of the organization in the country, is visiting schools in the town and surrounding area to educate children on the dangers. He said: ""Children are bringing live ammunition into schools. They are picking up big anti-aircraft guns and playing with them. ""I go into schools and talk to the children about what mines are, what explosive materials are, how to avoid the areas and what to do if you come across them. ""It's terrible to have to talk about this with children, but the reality is this is common now. Once in a while something happens and a kid is killed or loses an arm or leg."" Kanah has been putting awareness posters provided by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in hospitals, shopping malls and schools. He also gives out hats and T-shirts carrying the message. The British charity Merlin is working in a hospital in Nalut, a small mountain town home to just 25,000 people in the Nafusa mountains, and has treated a number of children for gunshots and unexploded ordnance since the end of hostilities. Since end of the conflict, two children have died in Nalut and at least five children have sustained serious injuries, according to Kanah and Merlin. Jo Woodrow, a physiotherapist working with injured patients in the hospital, said: ""Most of the people who fought in the war weren't soldiers before, so have little experience storing guns safely. ""They have come back from the war and leave them lying around. Children are curious and that's how the accidents happen. ""A lot of people are embarrassed so they don't tell us exactly how the accident has happened."" She added: ""At the moment, I'm working with a 17-year-old who was shot at point blank range by a sniper rifle that went off by accident. ""He has pins holding his legs together and has nerve damage. He won't be walking for a long time."" Woodrow said many of the victims had to leave Libya for treatment because of a shortage of rehabilitation facilities in the country.","Many Libyan children have been killed or injured in accidents involving guns and explosives .

"(CNN) -- George S. Patton did not like Willie and Joe. Bill Mauldin, on top of a jeep (his favored mode of transportation), was a hero to soldiers for his cartoons. The famed general was a spit-and-polish man, and ""Willie & Joe"" -- Bill Mauldin's popular cartoon dogfaces, who appeared every day in the military newspaper Stars and Stripes -- were anything but: unshaven, rumpled, their boots caked with mud, eyes weary from days on the line. The general made it known that he was not amused, and eventually Mauldin -- a 23-year-old sergeant who'd entered the Army to escape an aimless life in the rugged Southwest -- was summoned to Patton's impressive headquarters, a requisitioned palace in Luxembourg. ""Now then, Sergeant,"" Patton said to Mauldin, as recalled in a new biography, Todd DePastino's ""Bill Mauldin: A Life Up Front"" (W.W. Norton). ""About those pictures you draw of those god-awful things you call soldiers. ... No respect for the Army, their officers, or themselves. ... What are you trying to do, incite a goddamn mutiny?""  See some of Mauldin's award-winning work » . That was the last thing on Mauldin's mind. He was trying to tell the truth. The cartoonist, who died at age 81 in 2003, had a storied career that included two Pulitzers -- including one for ""Willie & Joe"" -- several best-selling books and renown from veterans. But he never let his abiding concern for the regular guy stray far from his thoughts. ""If I see a stuffed shirt, I want to punch it. If it's big, hit it. You can't go far wrong,"" he once said. DePastino, a history professor at Waynesburg College in Pennsylvania, found Mauldin's work a revelation. Like many of the postwar generation, all he knew of Mauldin were the occasional references in Charles Schulz's ""Peanuts,"" in which Snoopy would talk about quaffing root beers at Mauldin's house. ""I got 'Up Front' [Mauldin's first book], read it, and was stunned by the genius of the artwork,"" he recalls in an interview. ""It was like a hidden transcription of the war. ... I wanted to know what was behind the cartoons, and why they were allowed to be published."" Indeed, ""Willie & Joe"" was unlike anything that had appeared in America during World War II. In the early years of the war, the U.S. government had focused on the upbeat, but as the optimism of U.S. entry gave way to the two-steps-forward, one-step-back grind of daily battle -- coupled with stark sacrifices at home -- the strategy fell apart. Mauldin's characters were bluntly honest: War was dirty, absurd, bitter hard work. ""Willie & Joe"" quickly caught on with both enlisted men and -- upon syndication in the States -- the general public. ""I think the home front was hungry for the truth,"" says DePastino. Mauldin's cartoons provided ""a needed dose of realism,"" he says. ""[The message was] the enemy is lethal and people overseas are sacrificing more than you are."" But Mauldin had some officers on his side, up to and including the Supreme Allied Commander himself, Dwight D. Eisenhower. When Mauldin returned to the States, he was a hero. His first book, ""Up Front"" -- a memoir with cartoons -- became a tremendous best-seller, as did the follow-up, ""Back Home."" For a time he lived in suburban Rockland County, New York, among other successful artists and writers. But life among the creative swells gnawed at him, and in the late '50s he became an editorial cartoonist, first for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, later for the Chicago Sun-Times. He took on racism, Cold War politics, Vietnam and Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. He also went through the classic changes of his generation. He struggled with alcoholism. He was twice divorced, grappled with the counterculture, watched the World War II generation become forgotten and then deified. Through it all, he maintained a healthy skepticism for the establishment, whether it be martinet officers, self-important politicians or the suits in the corner office. DePastino remains surprised that his is the first biography of Mauldin, which perhaps speaks to the low regard our culture -- even pop culture -- has for cartoonists. ""If Mauldin had been a writer, there would have been a biography [by now],"" he says. But the soldiers themselves -- men such as Schulz, a World War II vet who didn't meet Mauldin until years after first mentioning him in ""Peanuts"" -- knew Mauldin's value. When he talks about the book, DePastino says, he gets his most emotional responses from veterans and their families. ""His art was about a group of men who are suffering unspeakable horrors in the trenches. His audience was those very men,"" he says. ""It's odd -- he was kind of mirroring their lives back to them. ... He was doing this for those guys. How many artists do that?""","Bill Mauldin created award-winning ""Willie & Joe,"" about Army grunts, in WWII .
Mauldin was young soldier like those he drew during war; they related .
Mauldin had long career, yet many only know him through ""Peanuts"" mentions ."
"(CNN) -- Shortly after 10 a.m. Blair Scott sent a text to his daughter Rose, a junior at Buckhorn High School in northeast Huntsville. He could feel the lump in his throat as he warned her: You have three minutes to get to a safe place. The twister was hurtling straight toward her. It was one of two apparent tornadoes that ripped through the area Friday. Scott jumped in his car and furiously drove the three miles from his home to the school. The speedometer said 80. In his read view mirror, he could see four police cars. But they weren't chasing him. They were also charging towards to the school and the sitting targets within. Scott arrived to a surreal scene wrought by the fury of the storm. His heart skipped a few beats. He was one of thousands of Americans unnerved Friday by a swath of severe weather that extended from Alabama to Indiana. Inside the school, it was hot, damp and dark -- the power was out. The staff had gone into storm mode at about 8:45 in the morning, huddling the students in the safest place of all, the hallway, Scott said. Rose was huddled with her classmates. She could feel her frightened friend's clawing into her arm. Everyone knew the tornado coming their way, like a killer approaching a helpless victim. Everyone was terrified. Rose was 20 feet away from the door and could feel the wind forcing its way underneath. It was so strong that even through the cracks, it made her hair fly. ""We didn't know if it was going to bust open at any minute,"" she said. Signs outside were blowing; trees bending. Suddenly, it became sunny. The wind went one way one minute and another, the next. Then, it began raining. Hard. The pressure changed and got so bad it made Rose's ears hurt. She got low to the floor. A large trash bin flew through the air. Where once there had been tall oaks, there was nothing. They were horizontal with the earth and Rose could see the house that used to be hidden by vegetation across the street. When it was over, teachers screamed as they saw their wrecked cars, the building's windows shattered and part of the roof in the parking lot. Similar storms ripped through the Huntsville area about a year ago. Students, teachers and parents all had their memories. Rose had even chased tornadoes with her dad -- both father and daughter are fascinated with science and meteorology. But she had never lived through a tornado before. Now she knew what it felt like. ""It was a whole different experience,"" she said. ""I couldn't even text. My hands were shaking so bad."" Many of the students were trying to call their moms and dads but cell phone service was sketchy. She was relieved to see her father when he arrived at the school. Scott said his daughter's friends pleaded with him. ""Please, Mr. Scott,"" they said. ""Take us home."" But he couldn't. School policy forbade it so that all the students could be accounted for. ""It was heartbreaking,"" he said. ""It was horrible in there. They were so scared and apprehensive."" Scott felt incredibly lucky that everyone he loved was alright. He took his daughter home and passed the rest of the day under a tornado watch.","Blair Scott sent a text warning to his daughter at Buckhorn High School .

"(CNN) -- A man walked into a Pittsburgh psychiatric hospital with a pair of guns Thursday and began firing, leading to injuries to seven people and two deaths -- including his own as police arrived and shot back, authorities said. ""This is a tragic day, a sad day, a senseless day,"" Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said after the shooting at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic. City and hospital officials speaking at a Thursday evening press conference did not give the identity of the shooter, nor did they elaborate on what his motive might have been. The assailant walked through the psychiatric hospital's front door with a pair of semi-automatic handguns around 1:40 p.m., according to Ravenstahl. Officers from the University of Pittsburgh police department arrived within ""a matter of minutes"" and ""engaged"" the gunman, the mayor added. ""There is no doubt that their swift response saved lives today,"" said Ravenstahl, lauding the police officers' ""courage and willingness to step up."" Like the man who is believed to be the shooter, no details were offered on the other person killed besides the fact he, too, was an adult male. Those wounded were swiftly ushered to nearby UPMC Presbyterian. All are expected to survive. Officials said two of five hospitalized patients have undergone surgery. The conditions of the five ranged from fair to serious. Two victims were treated and released. One had an injury not related to a gunshot wound. Medical center officials said the injured included hospital employees and a visitor. ""I expect all of these patients to survive and do well,"" said Dr. Donald Yealy, chairman of emergency medicine at UPMC, said in a statement. ""As the busiest trauma centers in the region, we prepare for this kind of multi-casualty situation."" Ravenstahl said that a University of Pittsburgh police officer ""was grazed with a bullet, and I believe he is doing well."" Steven Bartholomew, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said that his agency is ""working with Pittsburgh police and other authorities in the investigation."" ""Any firearms recovered will be traced to determine their source,"" Bartholomew said. Claudia Roth, the Western Psychiatric Institute's CEO, said five of those hurt are hospital employees. No other details were offered on the victims, including whether they had been targeted, how they got hurt and who might have shot them. At one point Thursday, the University of Pittsburgh's official Twitter account had a message that suggested a ""possible 2nd actor"" was involved and called for a lockdown. But later in the day, the medical center's own Twitter feed had a message insisting ""there was no second shooter"" and that there was ""no hostage situation,"" as had been reported elsewhere. While the crisis appeared to be over by 6 p.m., Pittsburgh's mayor stressed the hospital -- particularly its first and second floors, where the gunman may have been -- ""is still an active scene."" That said, authorities said they have no indication that anyone else was involved or that there is any continuing danger. ""Our crews are methodically going through the building to make sure that every floor is cleared and every room is cleared,"" Ravenstahl said. The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine's psychiatric department is based at the institute, which describes itself on its website as a ""leader in the treatment of mental health and addictive disorders."" U.S. News and World Report ranks University of Pittsburgh Medical Center -- and thus the Western Institute -- as being the nation's eighth-best psychiatric hospital. In addition to about 2,000 employees, the hospital has 310 beds, of which about 90% had been occupied on Thursday, said Roth. She emphasized after the shooting that treatment at the facility ""will be uncompromised,"" with care continuing to be delivered through the day and night ""the same way we always have."" CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","NEW: All seven who were injured are expected to survive .

"(CNN)  -- David overcame Goliath as Britain's David Haye claimed the WBA world heavyweight title with a majority 12-round points victory over giant Russian Nikolai Valuev in Nuremberg on Saturday night. Valuev had a massive advantage in height and weight, towering over former cruiserweight champion Haye, but the challenger fought a clever tactical fight to win the verdict of the three judges. One scored it a 114-114 draw with the two others giving it 116-112 in Haye's favor. The flamboyant Briton reserved his best until the final round, catching the eye of the judges with a series of combinations which came close to flooring a well-beaten Valuev, who had lost just one of his previous 52 fights. Blog: Wily David out-thought Goliath. Haye, supported by a strong British contingent, said that the victory was the fulfillment of a childhood dream. ""Ever since I was little, I said that one day I would be heavyweight champion of the world,"" he told ringside reporters. ""It's a dream come true."" The 29-year-old Haye is the first British world heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis retired in 2003. From the first bell, Haye, who is now 23-1, looked the sharper, unsettling Valuev with smart hooks, the Russian shaking his head to say he had not been hurt. But the shots were scoring points with the judges and it was not until the seventh that Valuev could be clearly seen to have won a round. Haye landed significant shots in the ninth and 10th and upping the ante in the final round rocked the champion with two huge left hooks which rounded off a superb performance against man with a 44 kilogram weight advantage and standing 28 centimeters taller. He now faces a mandatory title defense against American John Ruiz, who won a WBA eliminator in a bout on the undercard.","David Haye wins WBA world heavyweight title in Nuremberg .

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN)  -- Women's boxing will be included at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the president of the International Olympic Committee announced Thursday. Germany's Ina Menzer, left, fights American Franchesca Alcanter during a WIBF and WBC featherweight bout in May. The decision came during a two-day IOC Executive Board meeting in Berlin, at which board members also decided to propose golf and rugby for inclusion in the 2016 Olympic Games. ""I can only rejoice about the decision of inclusion of women's boxing,"" IOC President Jacques Rogge told reporters. ""I think it's a great decision. Boxing was the sole (Olympic) sport with no women involved.  ""The sport of women's boxing has progressed a lot, a tremendous amount, in the last five years and it was about time to include them in the Games.""  Have your say - should women's boxing be included? A men's class will likely be axed to make room for three women's weight categories at London 2012, the UK Press Association reported. Women will compete in the flyweight 48-51kg class, lightweight 56-60kg and middleweight 69-75kg, the agency said. When the IOC dropped baseball and softball from the 2012 Olympic program several years ago, it said it would consider adding new sports that had a clean reputation and a wide appeal. Rogge pointed out that women's boxing has around 200 athletes who could potentially compete in 2012, while softball has only around 120. As a result, he said, the IOC considered women's boxing to be more popular. Women's boxing has boomed in Britain since 2005, with the number of registered female fighters rising from 50 to 600, PA reported. Softball and baseball were considered for inclusion in the 2016 Games along with squash, karate, roller sports, golf and rugby, but the board decided to consider only the last two. Blog: IOC has picked the wrong sports, says CNN's Paul Gittings . The IOC has not yet selected the host city for 2016, but its board members will submit golf and rugby to the full IOC session for a final decision at its meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, in October. ""Golf and rugby scored high on all the criteria,"" Rogge told the IOC's official Web site. ""They have global appeal, a geographically diverse line-up of top iconic athletes and an ethic that stresses fair play."" The International Golf Federation has proposed two four-day strokeplay tournaments for men and women, with 18 holes per round and medals awarded to the three players in each with the lowest scores. The International Rugby Board has proposed men's and women's Sevens tournaments, with 12 teams in each being divided into two pools before semifinals and finals.","Women's boxing will be included in the 2012 Olympic Games in London .

"PARIS, France -- South Africa claimed their second World Cup crown with a hard-fought 15-6 victory at the Stade de France on Saturday night as England failed in their bid to become the first team to defend their title. Springboks skipper John Smit proudly holds aloft the William Webb Ellis Trophy in Paris. The Springboks -- who triumphed at home in 1995 -- failed to score a try for the first time in the tournament, while England were unlucky to have one controversially ruled out by the video referee soon after half-time. Mark Cueto dived over the line in the left corner but, after much deliberation, video referee Stuart Dickinson ruled that the winger had touched the whitewash with his foot before going over. It was a bitter blow for the English, who had showed little attacking potency throughout the tournament but were beginning to show some promising signs. Brian Ashton's team were beaten 36-0 by South Africa in the pool stages, but showed big improvement to reach the final with upset wins over Australia and hosts France after adopting a dour, forward-driven approach. Jake White, who is now expected to stand down as the Boks' coach, saw his side dominate the lineouts in the final while England paid for poor discipline. Full-back Percy Montgomery kicked four penalties and Francois Steyn landed another from just inside his opponents' half, while England's sole points came from the boot of 2003 hero Jonny Wilkinson. Montgomery kicked South Africa ahead with a seventh-minute penalty after Tait slipped in midfield and failed to release the ball. Wilkinson replied with a penalty of his own five minutes later after Boks winger JP Pietersen spilled an up-and-under kick. Montgomery made it 6-3 with another goal after flanker Lewis Moody needlessly stuck out his left boot to trip Jaque Fourie in the 15th minute, and Wilkinson was wide with a drop-goal attempt soon after. Steyn was just wide with a long-range penalty as England's forwards infringed again at the ruck, and the Springboks spurned a great opportunity just before half-time when scrum-half Fourie du Preez went for the line from close range instead of passing, and spilled the ball. However, the South African pack screwed England's scrum and won their own feed, from which No. 8 Danie Rossouw was held up on the line after a bullish burst -- and England were penalized for killing the ball, allowing Montgomery to land a third penalty for 9-3 at the break and a personal haul of 102 points for the tournament. England came out after the break without captain and 2003 winner Phil Vickery, with Matt Stevens taking his place at prop. And the English almost crossed for the first try of the game as center Mathew Tait brilliantly burst through several tackles before being cut down just short of the line, and the ball was flicked wide to Cueto on the left. However, Australian official Dickinson made a crucial decision which denied a vital five-pointer. England gained some reward, however, as referee Alain Rolland had noticed a South African infringement before Cueto crossed, and Wilkinson reduced the deficit to 9-6 with his second penalty. In the 47th minute, the career of Jason Robinson came to an end when the England full-back was forced to limp off with a groin injury in what was his final game before retiring. Montgomery extended South Africa's lead three minutes later after Martin Corry infringed at a ruck, and Steyn -- at 20 the second-youngest player to feature in a final -- made it 15-6 from 47 meters out after Ben Kay blocked Os du Randt in the 62nd minute. England made a raft of changes, bringing on 2003 champion Lawrence Dallaglio for possibly his last match at international level, but could not find a way through the Springboks' defense. Vickery refused to blame Dickinson's decision for his side's defeat. ""You get decisions like that in a game. Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't,"" he said. ""I'm not going to stand here and blame the referee. South Africa deserved their win."" Corry added: ""We can't fault effort and the heart. It's a shame that all that spirit counts for nothing. We gave it everything but it didn't go to plan. We are immensely disappointed and it's heartbreaking."" White hailed his side's stout defense, saying: ""That's what wins World Cups. England were a bit unlucky not to get that try. I'm really over the moon and it's a massive win for us as a group."" Skipper John Smit added: ""I'm sitting here and I'm trying not to cry. It's a feeling you can't put into words. This is for all of you. Thank you very much for all your support, even in bad times. ""It's a reward for four years of dedication and hard work. England gave us a good run. But we responded well to their technical kicking."" Lock Victor Matfield, who is joining French side Toulon, was named man of the match after dominating England's jumpers at the throw-ins. ""This is awesome. We worked for four years for this. We knew we were going to have to take it to England up front,"" he said. ""The emotions are greater than I ever thought. I can't wait to get back home. I can't wait to see all the South Africans.""

"(CNN) -- Brazilian side Santos booked their place in the FIFA Club World Cup final on Wednesday with a 3-1 defeat of Japanese outfit Kashiwa Reysol in Toyota City. The South American champions will now face either European Champions League winners Barcelona or Qatari side Al Sadd in Sunday's final. Santos took the lead at the Toyota Stadium after 19 minutes, Brazil forward Neymar displaying dazzling footwork to evade a challenge before curling a delightful shot into the top corner from the edge of the penalty area. Striker Borges ensured the eight-time Brazilian champions went into half-time with a two-goal lead when he bent a similarly impressive effort into the back of Kashiwa goalkeeper Takanori Sugeno's net. CNN blog: Is Roberto Mancini the right man for Man City? J-League champions Kashiwa rallied and dragged themselves back into the contest nine minutes into the second half, when defender Hiroki Sakai headed home Jorge Wagner's corner. But Muricy Ramalho's team sealed victory just past the hour mark, Brazil full-back Danilo dispatching a long-range free-kick into the bottom corner to end Kashiwa's resistance. The 20-year-old Danilo is on the verge of leaving Santos, having already agreed a deal to join Portuguese side Porto after the Club World Cup. Santos are making their first appearance at the Club World Cup in its current format, but won tournament under its previous title of the Intercontinental Cup in both 1962 and 1963. Barcelona, who claimed the trophy in 2009 and 2006, will be hoping to reach the final for the third time in six years when they face Asian champions Al Sadd on Thursday. Al Sadd, coached by Uruguayan Jorge Fossati, defeated African Champions League winners Esperance of Tunisia to reach the semifinals. In the Europa League, French side Paris St Germain beat Group F table-toppers Atletico Bilbao 4-2 but it wasn't enough to stop them crashing out before the round of 32 stage.

"Sanaa (CNN) -- Thousands of Yemeni air force personnel rallied in the capital Saturday to demand the removal of the president's half-brother as the country's air force commander. They marched in front of the Sanaa home of Vice President Abdurabu Hadi to urge the removal of the commander, Mohammed Saleh, whose policies are under fire by other air force officials. Thousands of air force members staged similar protests elsewhere in Yemen, with demonstrations occurring in 16 of the country's 21 provinces. The country has been beset with demonstrations against President Ali Abdullah Saleh since early last year. That's when pro-democratic uprisings spread across the Arab world. Demonstrators have been turning out against the president despite a power transfer deal that leads to his departure. Under the plan, the president will step down in February. He will receive immunity under the plan forged by the Gulf Cooperation Council, made up of six Gulf Arab states. Executive powers already have been transferred to Hadi. Senior officials in Saleh's General People's Congress party condemned protests against relatives of the ruling family and called the actions an inappropriate tactic and a violation of the power transfer deal. They discussed the air force ferment in closed-door meetings on Friday. Hadi's office said it is considering an idea to force Mohammed Saleh to step down temporarily and form a committee to run the air force. ""President Saleh will leave power willingly, but the opposition is pushing the wrong buttons and escalating the situation. Such actions will not help the safe transfer of power,"" said Tareq al-Shami, the GPC spokesman. ""Political factions need to ease the tension in this critical period instead of causing barriers and bumps in the way of change."" But opposition parties, while denying that they are standing behind marches against senior ruling family members, said they cannot stop the people from demanding their rights. ""It's a revolution, and Yemenis have learned how to step up to their commanders who are oppressing them,"" said Mohammed Qahtan, senior official of the opposition Islah party. Last week, Mohammed Saleh stoked anger at a meeting with senior air force officials and blamed them for not standing up for the president. One attendee threw his shoes at Saleh and called him a corrupt and oppressive commander. Such a gesture is considered a deep insult in Arab world. ""Mohammed Saleh demanded that air force pilots raid areas of innocent civilians. When we refused, dozens of pilots were imprisoned,"" said Abdul Aziz al-Muhayya, deputy commander of air force operations. ""We are revolting against oppression."" Al-Muhayya told CNN that the marches at the vice president's residence will continue until their commander is forced out of power. ""We are seeking an air force loyal to the country and not to a specific family. Our revolution will continue until the fall of the family from the country's military and air force,"" al-Muhayya said. Saleem Nasser, a pilot in the air force and one of the march organizers, said that more than 80 of his air force colleagues have been imprisoned and tortured by the ruling family after rejecting to attack tribes in the outskirts of Sanaa. ""They cannot imprison thousands of us. We will not stop and will only serve the country. We vowed to not attack our people for the sake of a person,"" Nasser said.","Air force rallies across Yemen are calling for the commander's ouster .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai police have arrested and detained another Iranian suspect in connection with a series of bombs that went off in Bangkok this month, a law enforcement official said. Madani Seyed Mehrded, 33, was taken at a rental house, where authorities also confiscated a computer and a mobile phone, said the official, who was not authorized to talk to the media. The Bangkok blasts did not kill anyone. Their intended targets are not clear, although authorities have said they were intended for Israeli diplomats. They went off a day after a device attached to an Israeli Embassy van in New Delhi, India, exploded, wounding several people. Another device, found on an embassy car in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, was safety detonated. The Thai National Security Council has drawn a tentative link between the bombs in Bangkok and those in India and Georgia, saying the materials used in the explosive devices were similar. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed Tehran for the attacks. Iran has denied the accusation, saying that ""Israeli agents are often the perpetrators of such terrorist acts."" Iran has also suggested that it would be willing to provide some assistance in investigating the Bangkok bombings. Arrest warrants have been issued for five suspects, all identified as Iranians. Three of the five were already in custody.","An official identifies the suspect as Madani Seyed Mehrded, 33 .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo grabbed his sixth hat-trick this season as Real Madrid went 10 points clear of arch-rivals Barcelona in Spain with a 4-2 home win over fourth-placed Levante. Sunday's victory left Real in the driving seat to win the La Liga title following champions Barca's 3-2 defeat at Osasuna on Saturday. Portugal star Ronaldo took his league tally to 27 goals this season with another superb display, but Gustavo Cabral gave Levante a surprise early lead in the Bernabeu. Ronaldo, the world's most expensive player, leveled from the penalty spot following a handball by Vicente Iborra, who was also sent off for his second yellow card. Ronaldo headed home a Gonzalo Higuain cross after 49 minutes and then completed his 13th hat-trick for Real with a thunderous drive that took him past legendary Hungarian forward Ferenc Puskas and into second place behind Alfredo di Stefano's total of 22 trebles for the club. Brave Levante pulled one back through Arouna Kone's header, but France forward Karim Benzema sealed three points for Jose Mourinho's men with a fourth after 65 minutes. Mourinho cautioned against thinking the title is already won despite opening such a big gap over Barca. ""The mathematics tell us that to consider this league won, it's necessary to get another 39 points, that's 13 wins,"" he told AFP. Earlier, third-placed Valencia moved eight points clear of the chasing pack with a 4-0 victory over struggling Sporting Gijon, ending a run of five league matches without a win. Sofiane Feghouli opened the scoring in the 34th minute, and his 73rd-minute effort was deflected in for an own-goal by Alberto Botia. Substitute Jonas Goncalves scored twice in injury time as Valencia moved to within eight points of Barcelona, while Gijon remained second from bottom.","Real Madrid beat Levante 4-2 in La Liga clash .

"(CNN) -- About 40 students at a university in New Jersey have been taken to hospitals for treatment after an outbreak of what authorities believe is the norovirus. The Rider University students, at the school's campus in Lawrenceville, were brought to hospitals late Wednesday night, the school said Thursday. The suspected outbreak comes a week after an outbreak began at nearby Princeton University, which is still under way, officials said. ""We are coordinating treatment information with that university. We have also informed neighboring institutions,"" Rider said on its website. Norovirus is a highly contagious illness that is often called stomach flu or food poisoning, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis in the United States. The most common symptoms are diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain. Most people get better within one to two days. Rider officials worked with health authorities throughout the night ""to identify ill students in the residence halls and treat them either on site or send them to area hospitals,"" the school said. Some of those taken to hospitals have been discharged and returned to campus. People who get the virus are contagious ""from the moment they begin feeling sick until at least three days after they recover,"" the school said. Infection can occur by eating contaminated food; touching contaminated surfaces and then putting contaminated fingers in your mouth; or having direct contact with an infected person. The school's food and custodial services are taking necessary steps, including cleaning all residence hall bathrooms and other areas. Rider has about 4,700 undergraduate and 1,100 graduate students, and 250 full time faculty members.","The school worked through the night to help sick students .

"(CNN) -- Porto's incredible season continued on Wednesday with a 1-0 victory in the Europa League final against Braga, giving coach Andre Villas-Boas the chance to clinch a treble in his first term in charge. The 33-year-old became the youngest coach to win a European title, having last month clinched the Portuguese title with five matches to play before ending the domestic league season unbeaten in 30 rounds. He was 95 days younger than previous record-holder Gianluca Vialli, who won the now defunct Cup Winners' Cup with English side Chelsea in 1998. Villas-Boas can now emulate one of his mentors, Jose Mourinho, by winning the Portuguese Cup final against Vitoria on Sunday and claiming three trophies in one campaign. Striker Radamel Falcao scored the only goal against Portuguese rivals Braga in Dublin, extending his record in the second-tier competition to 17. He also scored once in the qualifying rounds. Is Mourinho student the new 'Special One'? The Colombian netted for the 38th time this season, heading home Fredy Guarin's right-wing cross just before halftime as the club won the title for the second time. It was a happy 33rd birthday for Porto captain and goalkeeper Helton, who made a vital save with his leg just after halftime from Braga substitute and fellow Brazilian Mossoro. Villas-Boas' career came full circle in the Irish capital as he went up against the man who indirectly helped him get into football as a teenager, Braga coach Domingos Paciencia. He wrote to former Porto coach Bobby Robson about Paciencia, who was then a striker at the club, and as a result the late Englishman took him under his wing and put him in the scouting and statistics department at the age of 16. Mourinho, who also started out under Robson, brought Villas-Boas back to Porto from the British Virgin Islands, where as a 21-year-old he had been working as a director of football. He followed the current Real Madrid coach to Chelsea and Inter Milan before taking a coaching job at Academica in 2009 and helping the club avoid relegation to Portugal's second division. Villas-Boas was again re-employed by president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa after Porto finished a disappointing third in the league last season. He has revived the club's fortunes to such an extent that the Dragons won the title by a record 21 points, with the only domestic blot being a Portuguese League Cup defeat at home to Nacional of Madeira in early January. Braga finished fourth in the league, 38 points behind Porto, but reached the club's first European final after initially reaching the Champions League group stage before dropping down to what used to be called the UEFA Cup. Meanwhile, Lille moved to within a point of the club's first French league title since 1954 with a 1-0 win at home to Sochaux on Wednesday. It gave Lille a six-point advantage over second-placed Marseille with two rounds left, with Rudi Garcia's side also holding a superior goal difference. Lille can complete a domestic double by drawing at Paris St. Germain on Saturday, having beaten that team to win the French Cup last weekend and end 56 years without a trophy.","Porto coach Andre Villas-Boas becomes the youngest to win a European title .

"(CNN) -- The deputy commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan ordered troops Friday to treat the corpses of slain insurgents and civilians with ""appropriate dignity and respect."" The order follows a video that appears to show four U.S. Marines urinating on bodies, images that sparked swift condemnation from the United States and Afghanistan at a particularly crucial period in the U.S.-led war. ""We must treat the living and the dead with dignity and respect,"" Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti said in the directive, which was published Friday on the website of the NATO-led force in Afghanistan. He said troops must follow the rules of armed conflict and ""act honorably at all times."" ""In order to prevail, for the good of the coalition nations and the Afghan people, we can do no less."" The video surfaced as the United States and the Taliban have taken tentative steps toward peace negotiations and as the U.S. and its allies plan to withdraw troops by the end of 2014. The general's directive instructed officers to ensure subordinates know that they are obligated to report any allegations of misconduct involving corpses. He promised swift investigations and ""appropriate actions"" against offenders. The directive notes that ""defiling, desecrating, mocking, photographing or filming for personal use insurgent dead constitutes a grave breach"" of the armed-conflict laws. It also violates ""basic standards of human decency, and can cause serious damage to relations with the Afghan government."" The directive is dated Thursday, one day after a video surfaced online showing four men equipped with what a Marine official described as sniper gear urinating on what appeared to be the bodies of three men on the ground. One of the men says, ""Have a great day, buddy."" A voice asks, ""You got it on the video?"" to which another voice responds, ""Yeah."" Another jokes, ""Golden, like a shower."" It was not clear who shot or posted the 39-second video or where, though a U.S. official said it was a ""reasonable conclusion"" it was filmed in Afghanistan. Commanders have identified the four Marines who appear in the video, but those names have not yet been made public, said spokeswoman Maryann Cummings of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). NCIS has talked to the Marines and all four are currently in the United States, she said. Investigators are still tracking down information on the person or people who created and posted the video. The NCIS investigation, which was opened Wednesday, will report to Lt. Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps Forces Central Command. A separate administrative probe also will report to him. The investigations are being structured to allow for possible courts martial of the Marines involved, as well as a broader administrative probe into issues surrounding the event, according to a Marine Corps official. Those issues include whether commanders of the unit involved were aware of misconduct and whether a breakdown in discipline had occurred, the official said. The Marine Corps confirmed Waldhauser's appointment in a statement, in which it also said it was confident ""an expeditious, full and fair investigation will be conducted, and appropriate action will be taken in response to this incident."" While the identities of the people on the video haven't been released, the leadership of the 3rd Battalion 2nd Marine Regiment ""is confident those are their Marines,"" according to a Marine official with direct knowledge of the initial investigation. The official, based in Afghanistan, spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The unit, based at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, deployed in February or March and returned in September or October. While in Afghanistan, the unit was based primarily in Helmand province. Officials in the United States and Afghanistan expressed shock and outrage over the video. ""I have seen the footage, and I find the behavior depicted in it utterly deplorable,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in a statement. ""I condemn it in the strongest possible terms."" Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James Amos said that the behavior is ""wholly inconsistent with the high standards of conduct and warrior ethos that we have demonstrated throughout our history."" President Barack Obama knows about the video, said White House spokesman Jay Carney. He said he didn't know whether Obama had viewed it. ""What it apparently depicts is deplorable, reprehensible and unacceptable,"" Carney said. Afghan President Hamid Karzai called on the U.S. government to investigate and hand down the harshest punishment possible. ""This act by American soldiers is simply inhuman and condemnable in the strongest possible terms,"" the statement from Karzai's office said. A Taliban spokesman called the video ""barbaric."" ""This inhuman act reveals their real face to the world,"" spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi said via text message Thursday. The video surfaces at a critical time for relations among the United States, the Afghan government and the Taliban. Last year, the United States outlined its plan to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, beginning by pulling out 33,000 ""surge"" troops who had been deployed to help quell the violence by the end of 2012. The remaining 68,000 troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2014. Meanwhile, the Taliban tentatively agreed in recent weeks to open an office in Qatar's capital city of Doha, a decision widely seen as an overture aimed at establishing an outside forum for political talks with NATO-led forces and the current Afghan administration, among others. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Masoud Popalzai, Barbara Starr and Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","NEW: Investigators have talked to the four Marines in the urination video .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari's Fernando Alonso won an incident-packed Korean Grand Prix Sunday to take over the lead in the F1 world title race as his Red Bull rivals Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel failed to finish. The two-time champion took the checkered flag from McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, with his Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa in third place. it leaves the Spaniard with an 11-point lead in the championship from Webber, with 2008 champion Hamilton 21 points adrift. Vettel, who had looked set to lead the championship, is fourth 25 points behind, with two races to go. But the story of the race, held in appalling conditions on the new Korea International Circuit and Yeongam, was the demise of the Red Bulls. Australian Webber held a 14-point advantage going into the inaugural Korean GP and had started second on the grid behind his teammate Vettel. Rain had meant the early laps of the race were behind the safety car, but when it pulled off Webber made a mistake on lap 19 and collided with the unfortunate Nico Rosberg, who had been making a strong challenge in his Mercedes. ""Totally my my fault, I got on the kerb,"" the Australian told BBC Sport. It left Vettel in the lead while Alonso and Hamilton exchanged second position in a close battle, but on lap 46 of 55 the engine on the German's Red Bull gave up in a sea of smoke, oil and shattered parts. Alonso could scarcely believe his good fortune, but he had produced a peerless drive in the conditions to capitalize. Despite his delight, he told the post-race press conference that the championship battle was still wide open. ""We know with the new points system everything can change in one race - if you don't score, you lose 25 points to your opponents. ""Here it was bad luck for Mark and Sebastian. Anything can happen in the next two races. As we repeat many times, being consistent is very important, we cannot forget we need to be on the podium and fighting for the victory in the last two races."" Hamilton, whose teammate and reigning champion Jenson Button could only manage 12th after battling tire and grip problems, was delighted to keep revive his slender title chances. ""My tires were shot at the end, so it was just about trying to get the car home,"" he admitted. Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher finished fourth for Mercedes in one of his best drives since his comeback to Formula One this season with Pole Robert Kubica fifth in the improving Renault. Vitantonio Liuzzi was sixth for Force India with Rubens Barrichello in seventh in the Williams. The two Saubers of Kamui Kobayashi and Nick Heidfeld were eighth and ninth, respectively while Nico Hulkenberg claimed the final points scoring position in 10th. Red Bull maintain their lead in the constructors' championship, with a lead of 27 points over McLaren, despite their misfortunes in Korea.

"(CNN) -- Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum's ""Google problem"" is well documented. Now, the former U.S. senator's chief political rival, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, appears to be joining him. On Friday, a Google search for Romney's name was delivering a site called ""Spreading Romney"" as one of its top results. The spoof site (which, as will soon become apparent, is in no way associated with the Republican candidate or his campaign) is a twist on a site that caused Santorum to ask Google to bury it. ""Spreading Santorum"" popped up on the Web after the then-senator angered gay-rights advocates in 2003 with a comment that compared homosexuality to bestiality and pedophilia. A podcast host and sex columnist created the site, which ""defines"" Santorum's name with an explicit and lewd term we won't repeat here. As the site was shared around the Web, it gained in Google's search algorithm until it became the top search result for Santorum's name. On Friday, it remained second after his official campaign site. The Romney site also offers a fake definition for his name, one that's not quite as foul as Santorum's but still profane and far from complimentary. The site is registered to Ayokay LLC, a web design company based in Indianapolis, Indiana. Ayokay CEO Jack Shepler confirmed in an e-mail that he is the site's owner. He said the ""definition"" he chose for Romney (and this will make sense if you visit the site) is a reference to a years-old Boston Globe report about Romney and his family traveling to Canada with the family dog in a crate on the roof of his car. The dog relieved itself in the crate, according to the story, leading Romney to hose him down at a gas station and continue the trip. Shepler said the Santorum site obviously inspired his creation. ""While many consider both of the sites to be crude, I consider them to be a comedic way to bring attention to important issues, much in line with how Jon Stewart might bring attention to an important issue,"" he said in an e-mail. Some of Santorum's other rivals are getting similar treatment. At ""Spreading Gingrich,"" a contest is under way to create a definition for the former House speaker's name. That site, however, doesn't rank very high in a search for ""Gingrich."" At least not yet. As sites get more traffic and are linked from other sites, they gain traction in Google searches, rising closer to the coveted first page of results. The Web snark has also crossed the political aisle. With a little bit of tinfoil-hat flair, ""Spreading Obama"" (which, interestingly, bears the .org reserved for nonprofits), defines the Democratic president's name as ""A puppet of the New World Order Architects."" Say what you will, but at least we could print that one. In September, Santorum asked Google to remove the offensive site from its search results, going so far as to suggest the company would probably do so for a Democrat. Google refused, saying it ""very rarely"" removes content, and only when it is illegal or explicitly violates Google's terms of service. For the record, there's also a ""Spreading Ron Paul"" site, which appears to be a sincere endorsement of the U.S. congressman and fellow GOP presidential candidate.","Mitt Romney joins GOP rival Rick Santorum with a Google search-results problem .

"(CNN) -- New videos posted from the Syrian flashpoint city of Homs suggest a fresh wave of killings by the Syrian military after the fall of the neighborhood of Baba Amr. Activists have provided CNN with footage purportedly showing the bodies of 17 civilians that were discovered February 29 in villages near Baba Amr following an all-out assault on the Homs neighborhood that had held off a government assault for weeks. Much of the video is too graphic to show on air, but analysis of the video showed at least 12 bodies. In one, bodies are piled up in the back of a truck bed covered in blankets. Snow falls on the bodies as people in the background wail, some shouting, ""There is no God but God!"" One man off camera says, ""These are the victims of the massacre by the Shabiha (a government militia), entire families slaughtered by the forces of Assad"" -- a reference to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Several of the victims appeared to have been shot in the head, with some showing signs of deep cuts to the face and other body parts. At least one victim appeared to have had his arms tied up using red strips of cloth. Activist group Avaaz listed 17 names of the victims that it said it had confirmed, and claimed at least six of the men came from one family, named Sabouh. In another video, the camera pans down a line of five bodies wrapped in shrouds, as someone off camera reads off their names. A third video shows a woman wailing, ""Bring an end to Bashar"" as people try to console her before she falls to the ground, shaking. The activist who provided the video said the woman was the mother of one victim, Mahmoud al-Zoubi, and that she had just seen his body for the first time since his death. It was not clear how the activists managed to film the bodies. Opposition members say it is increasingly difficult to get videos and information out of the besieged city, with internet access mostly cut off and activists risking their lives to show what is happening. ""Those are civilians from Baba Amr who were killed two days ago, and today their pictures finally arrived,"" Rania Kisar, a Chicago-based member of the Syrian Revolution General Commission. Activists insist this is just one massacre among many. They say they expect more videos to surface. ""Homs is the capital of the resistance. Baba Amr is a strategic point in Homs because it gave the Free Syrian Army the freedom to conduct operations, access other neighborhoods and launch attacks against the regime,"" said Osamah, the SRGC's media director in Hama. He did not want to be fully identified for safety reasons. Residents in Homs tell harrowing stories of food, fuel and electricity shortages during the biting winter cold and a neighborhood besieged with raining shells and snipers firing from rooftops. One Syrian activist contacted by CNN offered further details about the killings in the videos. The activist said the Sabouh family were local farmers in the area known as Aysoon, where many of the armed forces were stationed and where artillery and rocket launchers were deployed. The activist cited eyewitnesses as claiming that Shabiha and armed forces rushed through the area opening fire on residents. Six men of the Sabouh family were killed, and when other neighbors came to help they were killed as well, the activist said. The incident occurred as many of the rebel Free Syrian Army forces were abandoning the Baba Amr neighborhood of Homs, and as residents were trying to flee the city. CNN cannot independently confirm the details of the killings because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. The United Nations estimates more than 7,500 people have died since then, while the LCC says more than 9,000 people have died during the conflict. The Syrian government says more than 2,000 security personnel have been killed in the violence.

"(CNN) -- Foreign aid to the Philippines in the wake of a deadly tropical storm has reached $12.6 million, the Philippine government announced Thursday. The United States, Australia and China were the top donors, giving cash and in-kind donations and pledges in the wake of the storm, which struck the weekend of Dec. 17. Sixteen other nations from Asia, the Middle East, and Europe also made donations or pledges, the government said. The death toll from Tropical Storm Washi, known locally as Sendong, reached 1,257 on Thursday -- largely unchanged from earlier in the week. Nearly 40,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, the government-run Philippines News Agency reported. The northern part of Mindanao, the main island in the southern Philippines, was hit the hardest. It was the scene of the worst devastation, and rain that followed the storm complicated recovery efforts. Sendong caused the Cagayan, Agus and Madulong rivers to overflow their banks, drowning many people in their sleep, the PNA reported. It sent torrents of water, mud, and logs through villages and two major cities, Cagayan de Oro and Iligan. More than 60,000 people are now taking shelter in 53 evacuation centers and another nearly 310,000 people are staying with relatives or in makeshift structures, PNA reported.

"(CNN) -- Two superb goals from Arjen Robben sunk England at Wembley as the Netherlands secured a last-gasp 3-2 win in Wednesday's busy schedule of international friendlies. It was cruel on England's stand-in manager Stuart Pearce, who had seen his experimental side battle back from 2-0 down only for the Bayern Munich star to grab the winner in extended injury time. An entertaining game burst into life just before the hour mark as Robben surged forward and drove home a low shot past England goalkeeper Joe Hart. Less than a minute later and the 2010 World Cup runners-up were two ahead as striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar bravely headed home Dirk Kuyt's perfect cross from the right. Huntelaar, who replaced Robin van Persie at halftime, clashed heads with England defender Chris Smalling in scoring and both played no further part in the match. England had their chances to get on the score sheet and Chelsea striker Daniel Sturridge, who had replaced Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard midway through the first half, spoiled an encouraging performance by a bad miss from close range. But soon afterwards central defender Gary Cahill beat the offside trap to slot past Maarten Stekelenburg. Then in the lengthy stoppage time, substitute Phil Jones slipped in forward Ashley Young to score an unlikely equalizer. But Robben was picked out by Mark van Bommel and with Leighton Baines standing off him, he had time to curl a shot home, albeit through a slight deflection off Cahill. England had named an inexperienced team with Tottenham's Scott Parker as captain ahead of Gerrard, while Pearce giave international starts to young striker Danny Welbeck, his Manchester United teammate Smalling, Chelsea's Cahill and Everton leftback Baines. Pearce said after the match that he believed a replacement for Fabio Capello would be in place by Euro 2012. ""I'm sure they'll go through the process of getting someone in place before the summer and if they don't, then they know they have got me available and all the planning is done,"" he said. Meanwhile, one of England's first group opponents in Euro 2012, France, scored an upset 2-1 win in Germany in a clash between two former world champions. It was the first defeat for Joachim Low's team in 11 games, but the home side were left depleted by injuries to regulars. A first-half goal by France's Olivier Giroud put the visitors on their way to a deserved victory. Giroud, the leading scorer in Ligue 1 this season for his table-topping side Montpellier, then set up substitute Chelsea's Florent Malouda for the second. Germany's Brazil-born striker Cacau scoring a late consolation for the hosts. ""From our point of view, everything went well, I was pleased with the way we pushed forward and, of course, I'm very pleased with the win,"" Blanc, who took over from Raymond Domenech after their sorry 2010 World Cup campaign, told AFP. The United States enjoyed a notable 1-0 win over Italy with Fulham striker Clint Dempsey's second-half goal earning a fourth successive victory and another boost for new manager Jurgen Klinsmann. Dempsey came close to opening the scoring in the first half as he forced a fine save from Gianluigi Buffon, while Sebastian Giovinco tested U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard. Lionel Messi worked his magic again to help Argentina to a 3-1 win over Switzerland in Bern with a hat-trick. The Barcelona superstar scored twice in the final five minutes to secure victory after Xherdan Shaqiri had leveled his 19th-minute opener. World champions Spain thrashed Venezuela 5-0 in a late kickoff with Messi's Barca teammate Andres Iniesta putting the home side on their way with the opener. Manchester City midfielder David Silva added the second before Valencia striker Roberto Soldado staked his claim for regular inclusion with a hat-trick to round off a convincing win.","Arjen Robben scores superb double as Dutch beat England 3-2 .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Tears rolled down my cheeks when I hung up the phone after interviewing Billy Ainsworth Cole, the sister of Harry ""Mike"" Ainsworth, who was gunned down mercilessly last week in New Orleans in front of his two sons, ages 9 and 11. Mike heard a woman scream as he was waiting by the school bus stop with his children. As a member of the Citizens 8th Police District Association in the Algiers Point neighborhood, Mike naturally jumped to the aid of his neighbor. When the woman tried to enter her car, a man attempting to carjack her pulled out a gun. Mike ran over and jumped on the front hood to try to stop the crime, only to be shot by the gunman. The gunman fled on foot, but left Mike stumbling a short distance away, suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest. He collapsed in a neighbor's yard. Moments later, before emergency help could arrive, Mike died, with his sons beside him. I could have been faced with that choice. I have two children, ages 6 and 4, along with my wife, that I would give my life to protect. But Mike's love, not only for his children and their mother, but also for a neighbor, showed me I have a lot more love to give. Now, waiting at the bus stop with my 6 year-old, I think about what I would do if faced with a similar situation. I've thought of myself as a courageous person, but after covering the story of Mike Ainsworth, I feel very small. Mike's heroism sparked a lot of discussion. One friend of mine even asked me, ""Would I prefer to be a dead hero or a live witness?"" My initial thought was that it was a cold response to such a tragic situation, but I took a day to think about how I would answer that. And I decided that if my wife, my mother or daughters were the potential victims of a would-be carjacker and someone had the courage to intervene, I would be eternally grateful. No one should judge Mike Ainsworth by suggesting he made a bad decision to put himself in harm's way. If people had the heart this man displayed through his actions, we all would be living in a better place. As we go about living our daily lives after Mike Ainsworth gave the ultimate sacrifice, his own life, to protect his neighbor we should think about what we can do to make another person's life better. I know what I'm going to do. I have a list of many heroes who are part of my history and have become famous in time. I'm just going to add the name Mike Ainsworth to that list. I can imagine that Mike's sons are having a difficult time understanding why their father is no longer with us, but the power of his spirit will live on, particularly with many other caring fathers. Mike's story should be an inspiration that encourages people to think less about how difficult their days are and more about taking a little bit of extra time to read to their children, answer as many questions as they have and hug them a little longer than they may want. I never met Mike Ainsworth, but I sure wish I did. His story has helped me come out of my shell and given me new purpose and a determination to use whatever strength I have to help others. We report on acts of death and dying every day and that can harden you as a journalist and make you numb, but it seems I don't report enough on the impact of life and living. Covering the story of Mike Ainsworth this past week has shown me how to open my heart a little wider, feel a little more compassionate and care a little more about others before it's too late. I hope and pray that Mike's two young sons and their mother, Cheryl, realize that Mike was not only a pillar of strength in the community but that his actions provide a rock solid foundation to support the rest of their lives.

"(CNN) -- Colombian authorities have issued a red alert, the highest level, for the Galeras volcano, because a non-explosive eruption occurred early Wednesday. Images show a slight plume of smoke and ash emanating from the volcano, which is in southwestern Colombia, near the border with Ecuador. Officials have called on about 7,000 nearby residents to evacuate to one of nine shelters in the area, but only 205 people had gone to four of the structures by Wednesday morning, the Ministry of Interior and Justice said in a news release. The volcano is not in a heavily populated region, and there were no reports of injuries or structural damage. Galeras, an ancient volcano that previously erupted in January, became active again in 1989.The only fatalities were in 1993, when nine people -- all scientists or tourists in or near the volcano's crater -- were killed. The volcano's summit stands about 14,000 feet (4,200 meters) above sea level.","Galeras volcano previously erupted in January .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Religious materials -- including Qurans that were burned at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, sparking Afghan protests -- were removed from the library of a detainee center ""because of extremist inscriptions"" on them, a military official said Tuesday. There was ""an appearance that these documents were being used to facilitate extremist communications,"" a military official said. ""Additionally, some of the documents were extremist in and of themselves, apparently originating from outside of Afghanistan,"" the official said. The official said the material was burned, but authorities are attempting to determine how much. The uproar prompted Gen. John Allen, commander of NATO's International Security Assistance Force, to issue a directive ""that all coalition forces in Afghanistan will complete training in the proper handling of religious materials no later than March 3,"" the NATO-led force said.. The training will include ""the identification of religious materials, their significance, correct handling and storage,"" according to the statement from coalition forces. Earlier Tuesday, Allen said the materials were gathered for disposal from the airfield's Parwan detention facility and inadvertently given to troops for burning. ""This was not a decision that was made because they were religious materials,"" he said. ""It was not a decision that was made with respect to the faith of Islam. It was a mistake. It was an error. The moment we found out about it, we immediately stopped and we intervened."" Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the airfield Tuesday, furious over reports of the burning. Lt. Lauren Rago, a spokeswoman for the coalition forces, told CNN in an e-mail earlier Tuesday that an investigation was under way to determine whether any material was burned before the mistake was discovered and, if so, how much. ""We are deeply concerned about the report of Qurans or religious materials being damaged, and will get to the bottom of what actually happened,"" she said. But a coalition official acknowledged the materials were improperly burned. Allen said he immediately launched an investigation. ""Something like this just cannot happen again,"" Allen said. Muslims regard the Quran as the absolute word of God. It is so highly revered that many Muslims will not pick up the holy book without ablution, a ritual washing of the hands. Desecrating the book, such as burning it, is therefore seen as an unforgivable affront -- as an act of intolerance and bigotry. Authorities are looking into the reasons why the material was gathered and why the decision was made ""to dispose of them in this manner,"" Allen said. Some troops have been questioned, but there have been no arrests or detentions, according to a coalition official. Afghan officials have been invited to join the investigation. Allen said he has offered ""sincere apologies"" to Afghan officials, including President Hamid Karzai. Allen also offered apologies to the Afghan government and ""the noble people of Afghanistan."" ""This was unintentional,"" he said. ""There was no intention by any member of ISAF to defame the faith of Islam or to desecrate the precious religious materials of this faith."" ""The materials recovered will be properly handled by appropriate religious authorities,"" Allen said earlier. Local citizens who work at the base discovered the material that had been put into a burn pit by NATO personnel and alerted officials. Soon after, demonstrators massed outside the base, chanting ""Death to America! Death to the Afghan government! Long live Islam!"" As a NATO helicopter circled overhead and black smoke billowed from the ground, men shook their fists in anger. Several men launched slingshots in the direction of the base. ""The desecration of religious articles is not in keeping with the standards of American tolerance, human rights practices and freedom of religion,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Tuesday. ""The concern is that some around the world will think that this represents an affirmative statement by the United States, and it does not represent our values or our view of how the Quran ought to be treated,"" she said. Allen said, ""This is not who we are. These are very, very isolated incidents. We've been here a long time. We've been shoulder to shoulder with the Afghans for a long time. We've been dying alongside the Afghans for a long time because we believe in them. We believe in their country. We want to have every opportunity to give them a bright future."" But ""these kinds of incidents, when they do occur, we will move quickly to correct them,"" he said. ""We will move quickly to hold people accountable."" Photographs surfaced purporting to show the damaged Qurans. A photographer for Agence France-Presse said Afghans who work inside the airfield told him they obtained the Qurans there. But the U.S. military said that was unlikely. ""When it became known that it was religious materials that were brought to the incinerator, the materials were secured by the military authorities in consultation with the local Afghan religious authorities, so it would be highly unlikely that the demonstrators would have any of the material from this incident,"" said Col. Gary Kolb, a spokesman for the NATO-led force. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul warned on its Twitter feed that protests were possible throughout Afghanistan in the coming days and noted, ""Past demonstrations in Afghanistan have escalated into violent attacks on Western targets of opportunity."" Last year, when controversial Florida pastor Terry Jones presided over what he called a trial of the Quran and burned a copy, Afghans took to the streets by the thousands. In the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e Sharif, demonstrators stormed a U.N. office and killed 12 people. In Kandahar, three people were killed in one demonstration, and nine in another when police and stone-throwing demonstrators clashed. American officials vociferously condemned the pastor's act. ""It was intolerant and it was extremely disrespectful and again, we condemn it in the strongest manner possible,"" said Gen. David Petraeus, who headed the U.S.-led international forces in Afghanistan at the time. In 2010, Afghans protested outside the Forward Operating Base Mirwais in response to an alleged Quran burning inside the base. But coalition forces said the suspected burning was a routine burn-pit session in which military documents are destroyed. CNN's Barbara Starr and Larry Shaughnessy in Washington, Masoud Popalzai in Kabul and Sarah Jones and Ashley Hayes in Atlanta contributed to this report.","NEW: Commander of NATO-led force mandates training on handling religious materials .

"(CNN)  -- As Santa busily sorts the naughty from the nice in a kind of seasonal secular judgment day, it's time to think back on all the promises you broke this year. Now, as this montage of moments flits through your head, let's home in on all those times you've sworn you'll totally give your buddy some good new tunes or your photos of an event. Yeah ... fail. As the internet has made sharing files and information a snap, we've all gotten into the habit of breezily vowing to share our digital goods. But you could also argue that the Web has contributed to our epidemic laziness. (Case in point: Taking the ""outsource my life"" stunt to a higher, more penny-pinching level, Fiverr lets you hire strangers to take care of all sorts of odd jobs for you for a mere $5.) And that laziness, exacerbated by selfishness and an inability to keep a thought in your head for more than three -- hey, is that a fruitcake?! -- means your intended recipients know your promises to follow up are as hollow as your average hipster's soul. Still, if the Christmas movies have taught us anything, it's that eleventh-hour redemption is totally possible. Here are a few quick tips for morphing from Scrooge's Doppelganger (pre-hauntings, of course) into Santa himself. The empty promise: ""Yeah, I have epic taste in music. I'll make you a mix of some stuff you should listen to."" Ah, the mix tape. Once a symbol of love and devotion (after all, you had to sync up the cassette and physically hit the red button for each new track), now a quaint relic of the past. First off, whipping out the blank CD or the jump drive is technically illegal (you're actually not even supposed to back up legally purchased materials for yourself, according to copyright.gov). An audio CD is fine if your bud is just going to whirl it around in his CD player (yes, because we all have Discmans these days. Cough.) But here are a couple of options that don't require you to burn anything onto a disc -- or even physically see said friend again in person: . One, make a Songza playlist and populate it with good songs. Songza is like a big free jukebox that streams tunes you handpick -- no downloading involved. Two, pull the right songs into an iTunes playlist and click Store-->Create an iMix, which puts your Various Artists masterpiece onto the iTunes store for others to hear in 30-second snippets and download en masse or song by song. iTune's new music social network service, Ping, just added the ability to share playlists with Ping friends as well. Which would be cool, if anyone actually used Ping. The empty promise: ""You look so gorgeous. I took a ton of great photos tonight -- I'll send them to you!"" Wow, wasn't that kind of you to traipse around Cindy's long-awaited dinner party, snapping photos at every turn! Yeah, it doesn't do anyone a lick of good if those photos now sit on the memory card or on your computer's hard drive for months on end. And lowish-res Facebook pictures don't solve the problem: Your hostess with the most-est obviously wants high-res images she can print, frame and display at will. In our completely anecdotal experience, those in the 40-plus crowd are most conscientious about quickly sending promised snaps. The problem is that they almost always do it via ginormous e-mail attachments, straining your server, weighing down your inbox and sometimes making said pictures difficult to glance at quickly. (Don't you hate when the photo shows up in the body of the e-mail and, due to the fact that it's about the size of a 17th century wall-hanging tapestry, you can only view a gray area of one corner?) Google's photo-sharing service, Picasa, solves the problem readily. Upload some photos to a web album (you'll need a Google ID, but you aren't required to use Gmail, luddite), mark it as private if you don't want the whole WWW seeing it, and then share the album with ""Friends,"" ""Family"" and/or ""Coworkers"" -- groups you piece together from your Google contact list. Your chosen ones can then download full size individual photos at their leisure. They can even add their own photos to the album -- a boon if, say, the mama-to-be wants to scoop up various attendees' images of her baby shower. Because apparently, you can never have enough shots of the quietly horrified crowd inspecting diapers smeared with mashed-up candy bars. Fun!","We've all gotten into the habit of breezily vowing to share our internet goods with friends .

"(CNN) -- As a Brit living in America, I remember the Blair/Bush ""special relationship"" of the early 2000s with great fondness. It seemed that our two countries might remake the world. With Britain providing the vision and America the military muscle, a liberal axis would flex its way through the War on Terror. The U.K. hadn't had such a sense of purpose since the Second World War. This week, Prime Minister David Cameron arrived in the United States with the express ambition of reviving what he and President Barack Obama now call ""an essential relationship."" So far the meeting has been cordial. Aside from agreeing to the need to draw down Western forces in Afghanistan, Cameron did his best to look interested in a basketball game in Ohio. He admitted afterward that he didn't have a clue what was going on and promised to explain cricket to Obama. Actually, cricket is very simple: Whoever doesn't fall asleep wins. Nonetheless, there is an air of anxiety about the visit. While Britain is still broadly committed to the neoconservative vision of George Bush and Tony Blair, Obama is not. The tensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a British suspicion that Obama simply doesn't like us, that his coolness betrays a mild contempt for us and our utopian visions. Before Cameron's plane landed, his views on the special relationship were laid out in an interview he gave to the historian Niall Ferguson in Newsweek. ""The only clue that Cameron is to the manner born,"" Ferguson writes, ""is the seemingly effortless way he shoulders the burdens of power. He must be the first prime minister in history to look younger after nearly two years in office."" Although the comparisons to Winston Churchill are absurdly overblown, Ferguson is right that Cameron certainly shares some of Winnie's worldview. ""Like Tony Blair, (Cameron) is drawn to the idea of military intervention where human rights as well as national interest are at stake. It was he, not President Obama, who pressed for military intervention in Libya last year."" Cameron tells his admiring interviewer that he is on his way to America to push the case for action in Syria. ""'My impulse is that I want us to do more,' he says emphatically."" That's probably the moment in the interview when Niall swooned. The encounter is significant because Niall Ferguson is probably the world's last neoconservative historian and David Cameron is probably the world's last neoconservative premier (Stephen Harper of Canada would like to be a neoconservative, but there's no way the Mounties are going to get rid of Assad). To be sure, Cameron has a habit of insisting publicly that he is not a neoconservative, while simultaneously rejecting multiculturalism, embracing ""muscular liberalism,"" and agitating for the removal of dictators in Egypt, Kuwait, Libya, and Syria. His chancellor was convinced by the ""excellent neoconservative case"" for war in Iraq and his education secretary wrote at the height of the Iraq conflict ""I love Tony [Blair]."" As you can tell, there's a lot of bromance to be found on the British Right. But Cameron arrives in Washington at a moment when neoconservatism seems to have run its course. Obama's agenda is largely domestic, while anything he does on the world stage is contextualized by falling revenues and the emergence of new powers like China and Brazil. The Obama Doctrine is marked by a cool, reserved support for allies that leaves them alone to pursue their own objectives with limited support. Hence, Britain and France were allowed to take the lead in Libya while it will probably be left up to Israel to pacify Iran. The result is that while allies often get what they logistically need, they rarely get the kind of enthusiastic political endorsement that they might want. Benjamin Netanyahu's frustration with Obama is analogous to British discomfort with the president. Consider his many petty slights against us. The president removed the bust of Churchill from the Oval Office, threatened to put a ""boot on the throat"" of British Petroleum (affecting the pensions of 18 million Britons), and confused England for Britain in a public address. When he met former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, he presented him with a gift of 25 DVDs ranging from ""Toy Story"" to ""The Wizard of Oz."" They couldn't even be played in the United Kingdom. For the British, this clash of personalities could have serious consequences. Right now, Argentina is behaving threateningly towards the British territory of the Falkland Islands, a self-governing archipelago of about 3,140 British citizens. Yet instead of honing in on that crisis, our prime minister is using his U.S. tour to promote the democratic transformation of the Middle East with the use of American arms. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department has sided squarely with Argentina. Obama's reluctance to side unquestioningly with old allies means the UK cannot rely on his support in the future. We might find ourselves actively defending the self-determination of all peoples everywhere, except when they are British citizens. Perhaps the ""special relationship"" between the United States and Britain could only last as long as Britain was a military power worth allying with and America had a president who was a big fan of the queen. But in a more complex, cash-strapped world we are destined to drift apart. Increasingly, the only thing we have in common is a mutual distrust of the French. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tim Stanley.","Timothy Stanley: U.S., Britain once had special relationship that has cooled with Obama .
He says Cameron, visiting U.S. this week, leans neo-conservative, Obama does not .
He says Obama has domestic priorities, gives support, but leaves allies to own objectives .
Stanley: Old allies don't get same support from U.S. as in past; Israel feels frustration, too ."
"(CNN) -- Haitian President Michel Joseph Martelly said late Friday he had accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Garry Conille, thanking him for his service and promising to move quickly to replace him. Conille just assumed the position in October after being ratified by the country's Senate. His reasons for stepping down were not immediately clear. ""This morning, Prime Minister Garry Conille presented me with his letter of resignation, I accepted it. I take this opportunity to thank him for his commitment. Of course, I regret that the resignation occurs in the context of where the country stands,"" said Martelly. The president asked domestic and foreign investors to keep calm and promised that the country's leaders are ""committed to harmonizing our efforts for a quick resolution of this situation and proposing a new prime minister."" ""Haitian people, you know you can count on me, as I can count on you. I made you promises; I will respect them,"" Martelly said. Conille, a former United Nations development specialist, served as chief of staff for former President Bill Clinton when the latter served as special U.N. envoy in Haiti. In that role, Conille was involved in international aid delivery to Haiti following the devastating earthquake in 2010. ""This resignation comes at a time when the Haitian people are eager to embark decisively on the path toward reconstruction, economic growth and the strengthening of the country's rule of law institutions,"" the spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. ""The secretary-general urges the Haitian authorities to act in the interests of the Haitian people and appoint a new prime minister as soon as possible,"" he added. Conille, a gynecologist, earned a master's degree in health administration from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He worked for the U.N. Development Program and is a protege of economist Jeffrey Sachs, director of The Earth Institute at Columbia University. When he assumed the position in October, Conille was welcomed in many corners as someone knowledgeable about development challenges with experience in working with the global community. Martelly's two previous prime ministerial nominees-- businessman Daniel Rouzier and lawyer Bernard Gousse -- had been rejected by the Haitian Senate. The inability to form a working government raised concerns about Haiti's ability to move forward after the earthquake. The United Nations estimates the January 2010 earthquake affected nearly 3 million people and killed about 220,000. More than 1.5 million people were left homeless in a country that was already the poorest in the Western hemisphere and wracked by crisis.","NEW: The president asks investors to keep calm, tells Haitians they can count on him .

"(CNN) -- FC Basel will take a 1-0 lead over Bayern Munich into the second leg of their Champions League last 16 tie after a late winner from substitute Valentin Stocker earned victory on Wednesday, when 2010 title winners Inter Milan also conceded a last-gasp goal to lose in Marseille. Bayern, the runners-up two seasons ago and four-time European champions, will still be hoping to make the final of the continent's top club competition, which will be held at the German side's home Allianz Stadium on May 19. But with only three wins in seven games since Christmas, and a run of 240 minutes without a goal, Jupp Heynckes' team will need to improve in the home leg on March 13. ""We only seem to win when we take the lead in the first half. If we don't, it turns out like tonight. It's just not happening for us at the moment,"" said goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Stocker struck in the 86th minute to stun the Bavarian giants, giving the Swiss side a precious advantage. Bayern might have been on the score sheet early at the St. Jakob Stadium, but home goalkeeper Yann Sommer twice denied Franck Ribery in a frantic opening. But Basel, who had accounted for English powerhouses Manchester United in the group stages, also went close to a breakthrough. Blog: Should Man City accept Tevez apology? Defender Aleksandar Dragovic forced Neuer into a reflex save and Alexander Frei rattled the crossbar from close range. Sommer continued his excellent night as he kept out a curling shot from David Alaba on the half-hour mark. Basel captain Marco Streller wasted a good chance just after the break when he headed straight at Neuer, but it was Bayern who gained the upper hand and appeared to be headed for at least a draw. Then with four minutes left, Cameroon striker Jacques Zoua picked out Stocker, who had been left clear by poor Bayern defending, and he shot underneath Neuer. Serie A giants Inter must have also thought they were heading for a goalless draw at the Stade Velodrome until Ghana's Andre Ayew popped up to head home for Marseille in the 93rd minute. It was the seventh game without a win for the Italians under Claudio Ranieri, who was left to rue his side's luck. ""We played a good match, in which we created more chances than them, and we didn't deserve to leave beaten,"" the Inter manager told the match broadcaster.","FC Basel beat Bayern Munich 1-0 in Champions League last 16 first leg .

"(CNN) -- It has been 20 years since filmmaker Michael Moore took on General Motors in ""Roger and Me."" He's still sticking it to big business for what he sees as the deliberate shafting of the little guy. Filmmaker Michael Moore says Wall Street created a ""invisible virtual casino"" with people's money. His new film, ""Capitalism: A Love Story,"" opened Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles, California, and opens nationwide next week. Moore talked with CNN's Larry King about whether capitalism is key to the American dream or the cause of an American nightmare. The following is an edited version of the interview. Larry King: You describe this movie as the culmination of all the films you've made. Does that mean this is it? Michael Moore: No. I hope not. It means that, for 20 years, as you said, I've been doing this. I started out by showing people what General Motors was up to and how this was a company that was making a lot of bad decisions and it wasn't good for the company nor for the country. That was 20 years ago. And since then, I've covered a number of issues and different things. But it all seems to come back to this one issue of ""follow the money."" Who's got the money? And whoever has the money has the power. And right now, in America, tonight, Larry, the richest 1 percent have more financial wealth than the bottom 95 percent combined. King: You're in that 1 percent, though? Moore: I don't think I'm in that 1 percent, but I make documentary films. But I mean, obviously, I do well because my films have done well. But, you know, even if I were, I think it's my responsibility -- my moral duty that if I've done well, that I have to make sure that everybody else. King: Does well too or has a chance? Moore: Well, has at least a chance but that -- and that the pie is divided fairly amongst the people and not just a few people get the majority of the loot and everybody else has to struggle for the crumbs. King: Are you saying capitalism is a failure? Moore: Yes. Capitalism. Yes. Well, I don't have to say it. Capitalism, in the last year, has proven that it's failed. All the basic tenets of what we've talked about the free market, about free enterprise and competition just completely fell apart. As soon as they lost, essentially, our money, they came running to the federal government for a bailout -- for welfare, for socialism. And I thought the basic principle of capitalism was that it's a sink-or-swim situation. And those who do well, the cream rises to the top and, you know, those who invest their money wrongly or, you know, don't run their business the right way, then they don't do well. Watch Moore talk about corporate greed . And if you run your business the wrong way, where does it say that you or I or anybody watching this has to bail them out? I understand why everybody seemed to get behind it, because a lot of people were afraid, because these people down on Wall Street had taken our money and made bets with it. I mean, they essentially created this invisible virtual casino with people's money -- people's pension funds, people's 401(k)s. They took this money and they made bets. And then they made bets on the bets. And then they took out insurance policies on the bets. And then they took out insurance against the insurance -- the credit default swaps. King: You started filming before Lehman Brothers went belly up. Moore: Yes. King: The stock market tanked. Now, how did the events, as it occurred, affect the movie? Did it change gears? Moore: It didn't change in terms of what I was looking at, but it did, obviously, offer probably the best example of why this is a system that is really corrupt at its core -- corrupt because it doesn't, it isn't run with democratic -- small ""d"" -- democratic principles. There's no democracy in our economy. You and I and the people watching have no say in how this economy is run. The upper 1 percent, the people down on Wall Street, the corporate executives, they're the people that control this economy. King: And they don't want to see the economy do well? They don't want to see people... Moore: Oh, they sure do. King: Don't they want people to make money so they can buy the products? I mean it's silly if they want people unemployed? Moore: Oddly enough, yes. King: Why? Moore: I'll tell you why. Because your employees are your biggest expense. And, as you've noticed in the last few months, as the unemployment rate has gone up, so has the Dow Jones. Now, you'd think, you know, that Wall Street would respond with ""Oh, my God, unemployment is going up, you know, this is bad for business."" But the reality is, is that Wall Street likes that. They like it when companies fire people because immediately the bottom line is going to show a larger profit. King: Are you saying the investor is more important than the employee? Moore: Yes. The investor -- and the investor, these days, they want the short-term, quick profit and they want it now. But in the long-term, here's what happened. When I was on this show 20 years ago, 20 years ago this week, I was here with ""Roger and Me"". King: I remember. Moore: And General Motors, that year, made a profit of $4 billion. And yet they had just laid off another 30,000 people. Now, why would you lay people off when you're making a record profit of $4 billion? I mean that was totally insane. But they thought, well, you know, we can make a bigger profit. Maybe we can make $4.2 billion if we move those jobs to Mexico. And so they're always, you know, we can make a little bit more money if we do this. By firing those workers, Larry, they got rid of the very people who buy their cars.","Filmmaker Michael Moore takes on capitalism in his latest documentary .

"(CNN) -- It's thousands of square miles wide, virtually devoid of oxygen and it has been blamed for an increase in shark attacks: the Gulf of Mexico ""Dead Zone"" is getting bigger and forcing marine life -- including sharks - into shore. Signs warn the public in an area harboring high bacteria near a drain at Will Rogers State Beach, California. The zone has been caused by a flood of nutrients, such as agricultural fertilizers, which boost algae production in the sea. These growths consume huge amounts of oxygen creating a ""marine desert"" almost devoid of life. The ""Dead Zone"" varies in size each year, but in 1999 it was 7,728 square miles -- that's nearly the size of Delaware and Connecticut combined. The huge size of the ""Dead Zone' is due to the increase in nutrient pollution flowing down rivers, including the Mississippi, which is estimated to have risen threefold in the last fifty years as chemicals become more and more common on farms. Environmentalists fear that the drive to radically increase the amount of corn-based biofuels produced in the U.S. from 15 billion gallons to 36 billion by 2022 could increase pollution in the Mississippi by 19 per cent. But the problem is by no means limited to U.S. waters. Similar ""Dead Zones"" are being discovered across the world and a major United Nations report in 2003 found that the number had doubled each decade since the 1960's. The UN report also warned that the number will continue to increase as intensive agriculture spreads around the world and that they are already having a significant impact on commercial fish stocks. All of this can come as quite a surprise. Growing water demands, more pollutants . Think about pollution and you tend to imagine tall smoking chimneys or pipes pouring industrial effluent into our rivers and lakes. But the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly becoming a concern for environmentalists across the world. Agriculture, including livestock and poultry farming, can be a source of a wide range of pollutants that find their way into our water supplies through run-off and leaching. This happens when rainfall exceeds the capacity of the ground and it flows into watercourses and groundwater supplies taking dissolved pollutants with it. These can include sediment from eroded land, as well as phosphorus and nitrogen compounds from chemical fertilizers and animal waste, which can also harbor disease pathogens. These pollutants can have a serious effect on water sources by depleting oxygen levels, stunting the growth of plants and even suffocating fish -- as in the Gulf of Mexico ""Dead Zone."" The concentration of pollutants can be particularly high in drought years, when heavy water demand can reduce the flow rate in rivers and cut their ability to dilute chemicals. The effects of this can be acute in the developing world, where the pressure to feed a growing population combined with a low level of regulation can cause serious problems. A huge increase in the amount of synthetic chemicals being used in the Philippines over recent years has caused substantial environmental damage to the country's water supplies, according to a 2008 report by Greenpeace. Between 1961 and 2005 fertilizer use in the Philippines increased by 1000 percent. ""This model of agricultural growth is fatally flawed because of declining crop yields and massive environmental impacts,"" says Greenpeace campaigner Daniel Ocampo. ""Aside from causing land degradation and losses in soil fertility, agrochemicals cause water pollution that directly and indirectly affects human health."" According to Greenpeace, analysis of groundwater in the Benguet and Bulacan provinces in the Philippines, found that 30 percent of tested wells had nitrates levels above the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water safety limit. The Philippine National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) says that 37 per cent of water pollution in the country originates from agricultural practices. As well as causing an increase in the algal blooms that can cause ""Dead Zones,"" agricultural nitrates have been identified as a factor in the growth of toxic ""red tide"" algae and high levels in drinking water can also pose a health risk to humans, especially children. Agriculture's impact on water pollution . Clearly there is a need to shift away from the current industrial agriculture system which promotes the reliance on agrochemicals while neglecting to consider their negative effects on human health, the environment, and the economy of local communities. The problem is particularly serious in China, where a combination of rapid development, a growing population and intensive agriculture has led to widespread pollution and even water shortages. Scientists studying information from monitoring stations have said that 44 per cent of Chinese rivers are polluted. ""Many lakes and water courses contain an excess of nutrients and need treatment before they are suitable as freshwater sources,"" the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in 2005. According to Chinese state officials 10 per cent of farm land in the country is polluted posing a ""severe threat"" to food sources, with excessive agricultural chemical use being blamed, along with industrial effluent and solid waste. But controlling water pollution from agricultural run-off presents many challenges: it occurs over a wide area, goes across borders and often the source is hard to identify. It also varies over time and can increase or decrease depending on changes in land-use and ownership. Lax local law enforcement, corruption and inefficiency can all compound the problem. Legislators around the world are calling for a closer integration of environmental and agricultural policies, and more help for farmers in managing potentially hazardous substances. But many environmentalists see a solution with increased incentives for organic farming, which uses fewer chemicals and, argue groups such as the UK Soil Association, with no appreciable decrease in yields. But while the solution remains a matter of debate, the scale of the problem continues to grow and grow.

"Rome (CNN) -- A cruise ship of the Costa Cruises line is adrift off the coast of the Seychelles after a fire in its engine room, the Italian coast guard said Monday. The ship, the Allegra, is a sister of the Costa Concordia, which wrecked off the coast of Italy on January 13, killing at least 21 people. The fire left the Allegra without propulsion, although its communications equipment is intact, the authorities said. The Allegra's fire has been put out, and the passengers are all in good health, the authorities said. The Seychelles is sending a tug, and merchant ships in the area are steaming toward the Allegra, the coast guard said.","An engine room fire leaves the Costa Allegra without propulsion, authorities say .

"Rome (CNN) -- The family of a Minnesota couple that remains unaccounted for after a massive cruise ship ran aground off an Italian island last month plans to hold a memorial service to celebrate their lives. Gerald and Barbara Heil have been missing since the Costa Concordia hit rocks and ran aground off Giglio Island on January 13. Relatives said they accept the decision to call off the search for missing passengers. A service is planned in the coming weeks, the family said in a statement. ""We are certainly disheartened to hear this news but understand and accept the decision to bring the search operation to a halt,"" the statement on the family website said. ""We cannot express enough our sincere gratitude to all those involved in the search and rescue effort."" Their daughter said her mother had not traveled much until her father retired from the Minnesota Department of Agriculture. ""They'd been going a lot of places,"" Sarah Heil told Chicago's WBBM Radio. ""I was really happy because they deserved to go on this awesome trip they had planned."" The Heils are from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. A total of 15 people remain missing after the cruise ship's collision off the coast of Tuscany with about 4,200 people aboard. Seventeen bodies have been recovered. Franco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia, said after the ship hit the rocks, he ran it aground to keep it from sinking and limit the tilting. It came to rest on its right side with roughly 50% of the ship under water. It is currently rotated nearly 90 degrees. Salvage operations in the part of the ship above the water line will continue, salvage officials said, along with searches around the wreck. Underwater operations have previously been temporarily suspended for safety reasons, but have always resumed. Technical experts are advising they come to a permanent end. Schettino is under house arrest on suspicion of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still aboard. He denies the charges, saying his actions saved lives. Schettino has admitted to prosecutors, defense attorneys and a judge that he made a ""mistake"" in colliding with the rocks off shore. But he has brushed aside suggestions that he was going too fast, as prosecutors allege. The lead prosecutor is asking that Schettino be sent back to jail. A hearing has been scheduled for Monday. However, Schettino's lawyer says his client should be released from house arrest. A number of survivors have filed lawsuits against the company that ran the cruise, Costa Cruises. Costa has announced it is offering each of about 3,200 passengers who had been aboard the vessel a lump sum of 11,000 euros ($14,400), in compensation for their loss of property and emotional distress, as well as a refund of costs associated with the cruise. Separate agreements will be reached with those passengers who were injured and needed treatment at the scene and with the families of those who died, Costa said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to tackle another election-year blockbuster and will decide whether the University of Texas' race-conscious admission policies violate the rights of white applicants. If health care reform, illegal immigration crackdowns, voting rights and TV indecency were not enough, the court is poised to add to its high-profile docket, wading into the divisive issue of state-mandated racial diversity and affirmative action. Oral arguments would be held this fall, ensuring the court -- however it decides the appeal -- will be a major campaign issue. A ruling, however, will not likely be issued until early 2013. Abigail Noel Fisher individually sued the flagship state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she was a high school senior in Sugar Land, Texas. The school defends its policy of considering race as one of many factors -- such as test scores, community service, leadership and work experience -- designed to create a diverse campus. The high court has had an evolving record on the discretion of state officials to decide who attends their institutions. The justices in 2003 said state universities can narrowly tailor their admissions policies to consider an applicant's race. That landmark case from the University of Michigan is the subject of current but separate appeals over a state ballot measure designed to eliminate any racial criteria. A divided federal appeals court in July concluded the voter-approved ban on ""preferential treatment"" at public colleges and universities was unconstitutional, and ""alters Michigan's political structure by impermissibly burdening racial minorities."" The Texas case is complicated over the issue of ""standing"" and whether Fisher should even be allowed to bring her lawsuit. She graduates this spring from Louisiana State University, where she went after being rejected by the University of Texas -- and Texas officials had argued she would then have no live controversy or claim necessary for the high court to intervene. They said her only ""harm"" would be trying to recoup nonrefundable application fees. In accepting the case, the high court made no mention of whether the standing issue would affect its ultimate ruling. The court also announced Justice Elena Kagan will not participate in the case since she apparently had been briefed on the issue as the Obama administration's solicitor general before joining the high court. That leaves the possibility of a 4-4 ruling, meaning Fisher would not prevail and leaving undecided the larger constitutional questions presented. Fisher's attorneys made the strategic decision to sue as an individual instead of bringing a class-action discrimination claim, which would have made it easier in some respects. Groups opposed to the state's policies applauded the court's decision to get involved. ""Using race in admissions decisions, to achieve diversity, amounts to stereotyping people by their race,"" said Joshua Thompson of the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, which filed a legal brief in support of Fisher. ""Racial diversity in a student body does not guarantee a diversity of experience and perspectives. It is unrealistic and wrong to try to pigeonhole people by their race."" In a statement issued after the high court agreed to hear the case, the University of Texas defended its admissions process, saying ""it is vital for the university to weigh a multitude of factors when making admissions decisions about the balance of students who will make up each entering class."" ""We must have the flexibility to consider each applicant's unique experiences and background so we can provide the best environment in which to educate and train the students who will be our nation's future leaders,"" the statement said. At the time, the state of Texas provided automatic admission to its flagship university for in-state students finishing in the top 10% of their high schools. Fisher just missed that opportunity, so had to compete in the larger pool of students seeking admission to the highly competitive school. The state has since narrowed that admissions window to the top 8%. The Michigan case was divisive in 2003, with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor the swing vote. ""In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity,"" O'Connor said. ""The (Michigan) Law School's educational judgment that such diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to which we defer."" But Justice Clarence Thomas was among four conservative justices who found the policies unconstitutional. ""The Law School, of its own choosing, and for its own purposes, maintains an exclusionary admissions system that it knows produces racially disproportionate results. Racial discrimination is not a permissible solution to the self-inflicted wounds of this elitist admissions policy."" Despite that high court ruling, some states, including California, do not allow race considerations in college admissions. The issue now before an arguably more conservative high court is whether the Texas policies should be re-evaluated, as states have had nearly a decade to put such diversity considerations into place. It also gives greater intensity to the Supreme Court overall in an election year. The justices next month will take on a challenge to the health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama, perhaps the biggest issue the court has tackled since the dispute over the 2000 presidential election. In April, Arizona's controversial illegal immigration law will be argued. Legal analysts say the justices will publicly avoid the politics of these hot-button issues, and focus on the law, but many said they wonder what long-term effect these cases will have on the judiciary's reputation. ""We're in a little bit of a political death spiral for the Supreme Court, as ideologues in politics, on the left and right, attack justices with whom they disagree, maybe decreasing the public's confidence in the Supreme Court,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a Washington lawyer and publisher of SCOTUSblog.com. ""And as they take up health care, affirmative action, abortion -- cases (that) inevitably are going to be coming, immigration -- all of those issues -- there are going to be more excuses to attack the justices, which is unfair and sad, but we don't yet see a way out.""","University of Texas defends its admissions policy .

"(CNN) -- After seeing his three-decade rule come to an end, Yemen's former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, will leave the country for Ethiopia this week, ruling party officials said Monday. Saleh returned to Yemen just days ago. However, he was under increased pressure to leave, as Yemenis worry his presence will undermine efforts of the new president, Abdurabu Mansur Hadi. Saleh and Hadi appeared at the presidential palace Monday for a former handover of power ceremony amid cautious optimism and ongoing threats of violence in the country. Hadi, who served as Saleh's vice president, was elected to the post last week and was sworn in Saturday in the capital, Sanaa. The event cemented a power transfer deal reached in November to end months of protests and violence over Saleh's longtime rule. Before Hadi became acting president in November, Yemen had been engulfed in anti-Saleh protests. The agreement was brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council and backed by the United States. Officials with Hadi's office confirmed Saleh will depart Yemen this week, but would not divulge his destination. There have been discussions about Saleh settling in either Oman or Ethiopia, but the former president has not made a decision, according to a Yemeni government official who asked for anonymity as the official is not authorized to speak to the media. Saleh expressed his support for Hadi at the ceremony Monday. ""I would like to congratulate my brother and colleague, His Excellency President Abdurabbu Mansur Hadi, for being elected as president of the republic."" Hadi spoke next, saying, ""Today, we welcome and bid farewell. ... Welcome a new leadership and we bid farewell to the leadership. ... This means that we lay new rules for the exchange of peaceful transfer of power in Yemen, because security and stability is the basis of development."" Acknowledging the numerous challenges faced by Yemen, Hadi added, ""We are in front of a difficult and complex time and the Yemeni people, who in millions participated in the early elections, gave a clear message for standing with security and stability in order for better change."" At the end of the ceremony, Saleh handed a Yemeni flag to Hadi. While the handover was taking place, and in a sign of just how much anger is still directed at Saleh, more than 1,000 protesters marched from Change Square toward Hadi's house, demanding Saleh's prosecution and condemning Hadi's appearance with the former president. On Saturday, Hadi promised to continue the fight against al Qaeda, calling it ""a religious and national duty"" for citizens of his nation. But as he was being sworn in, a deadly car bomb killed more than 20 security force members in another part of the country. The explosion occurred near the presidential palace in Mukalla, the provincial seat of Hadramout province, a senior security official and an eyewitness said. The Mukalla palace is one of several presidential palaces throughout the country. Hadramout province is in the country's east; Sanaa is in the west. ""Yemen is a country where such attacks take place, so this is not a surprise,"" said Ali Saeed Obaid, a government official. No one immediately claimed responsibility. Speaking about the fight against al Qaeda, Hadi said he hoped an effort to eradicate militants would lead to the return of displaced persons to their towns and villages. ""The country does not need additional crises to deepen its wounds, as the next period requires serious dialogue and clear outlines through a new constitution that meets the national expectations,"" Hadi said. U.S. President Barack Obama called Hadi to congratulate him and to say that the United States ""will stand with the people of Yemen as they continue their efforts to forge a brighter future for their country,"" according to a White House statement. ""Under President Hadi's leadership, Yemen has the potential to serve as a model for how peaceful transitions can occur when people resist violence and unite under a common cause,"" Obama said, noting that much work still lies ahead. Hadi received 99.8% of the 6.6 million votes cast in Tuesday's election, according to Mohmmad Hassan al-Hakimi, chairman of the Supreme Committee for Elections and Referendum. Saleh, who led Yemen for 33 years, was wounded in a June assassination attempt at his presidential palace during battles between government troops and tribal fighters. ""Saleh has the option to continue involvement in politics, and the power transfer deal will not force him to step aside,"" said Abdu Ganadi, his senior aide. ""He is the leader of the GPC, and his voice and support will continue being heard in the GPC."" But the U.N. envoy to Yemen, Jamal bin Omar, said the Arab nation ""is turning the page."" He said a coming ""national dialogue conference"" will be an ""opportunity to draft a new constitution that will be a new social pact among the Yemenis."" Human Rights Watch has called on Hadi to make changes without delay. ""Yemen's potentially historic transition will be off to a shaky start unless Hadi makes an immediate break with the abuses of the past,"" said Letta Tayler, the group's Yemen researcher. ""Yemen's new leader needs to move decisively to usher in promised reforms that uphold human rights and the rule of law."" The 65-year-old Hadi is a British-, Egyptian- and Soviet-trained army officer, recently promoted to field marshal. He had been vice president since 1994 and ran for a two-year term as president on pledges of improving security and creating jobs. But he's never had much of a power base, and Yemen's problems are expected to take longer than two years to fix. Yemen is the poorest country in the Middle East, with a severe shortage of water and rising levels of malnutrition among its population of about 25 million. Saleh faced a separatist movement in the south, sectarian tensions in the north and the growing presence of what Western officials describe as al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

"Cincinnati (CNN) -- Mitt Romney had a mutiny on his hands. Not with his staff but with his embeds. The hardworking, 20- and 30-something off-camera network news reporters who chronicle Romney's every public utterance had decided on a plan: They would band together and confront the candidate working the rope line, mini-cams in hand, with the hopes of forcing Romney to comment on the Rush Limbaugh controversy. Limbaugh had called a woman who testified on the importance of birth control coverage a ""slut."" Not surprisingly, outside of Seattle on Friday, Romney declined to answer a question from CNN about Limbaugh's insult. Romney rarely answers questions from the embeds and reporters who try to catch him on the rope line. He can hear them but simply ignores them. The Romney embeds are quite used to this. Since the former Massachusetts governor jumped into the GOP race, he has kept his traveling press corps at arm's length. Even though their news organizations pay roughly $1,000 an hour to have these reporters fly aboard Romney's press charter for the sole purpose of round-the-clock coverage of the candidate, the embeds have limited access to him. In the last month, he has held just one ""media avail,"" jargon for a brief news conference. Romney prefers his Fox News Channel comfort zone, appearing on the conservative-leaning cable news channel sometimes several times a week. But the Romney campaign's attempt to control the message fell victim to its own disciplined approach. After Romney zipped past CNN's camera without making a comment, the candidate and his staff hopped aboard their campaign plan for a five-hour flight to Ohio. While he was in the air, his adversaries were having a field day with his silence on the Limbaugh comments. A tweet from this reporter about Romney's nonresponse was re-tweeted by other media outlets and within seconds it had entered the social media bloodstream. Before long, the news (or lack thereof) was picked up by the left-leaning Web sites Huffington Post and Think Progress, which spread the information to their hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter. By the end of the day, the President Barack Obama's top political adviser, David Axelrod, had tweeted: ""Rush's vile, appalling assault on Sandra Fluke deserves universal condemnation. How can folks who calls themselves leaders walk away?"" It was a clear shot at Romney, who was just landing in Ohio. Flash forward to moments after Romney had finished his speech in Cleveland Friday evening. The embeds pounced. And Romney finally broke his silence. ""I'll just say this, which is it's not the language I would have used,"" Romney said before moving down the rope line. Had Romney said the same thing six hours earlier, or perhaps something a bit more condemnatory, the GOP contender would have averted a news cycle marked by his silence. All of this is just dawning on the campaigns in this new maelstrom. This is the first presidential campaign to feel the full effects of Twitter. Back in the 2008 campaign, the site was in its political infancy, used to shoot out press releases and shoot down negative stories more than anything else. The last campaign was more about YouTube -- the Obama Girl and so on. How things have changed. Witness Andrew Kaczynski at the website Buzz Feed. Kaczynski has quickly earned a large social media following by tirelessly unearthing long-forgotten and mostly embarrassing videos lurking in the bowels of C-SPAN's website and YouTube and tweeting them out. Reporters who follow Kaczynski then re-tweet his handiwork and the earworm is born. If the video is good enough -- such as the one from 2002 featuring then-Governor Romney describing himself on C-SPAN as having ""progressive views"" -- count on the clip to surface on cable news. Former Jon Huntsman press secretary Tim Miller kept a sharp eye on his own Twitter account while his candidate was in the race to stay on top of the onslaught of information. To stay on guard, he simply followed all of the people tweeting about Huntsman. ""With the expansion of news outlets covering the day-to-day minutiae of the campaign and Twitter creating a never-ending news cycle, this campaign has made rapid response and message discipline more important than ever,"" Miller told CNN. Naturally, the candidates handle this volatile environment in different ways. Whereas Romney does his best to tune out the noise, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich seem to plunge right into it. Santorum could not be more different than Romney in his dealings with the media. The former Pennsylvania senator holds ""avails"" nearly every day. After debates, he barrels straight into the media spin rooms to take questions. Unlike Romney, GOP spin-doctors say, Santorum needs the free media. ""Romney's advantages with organization and funding mean that he is not as dependent on earned media as is Santorum,"" former Republican National Committee spokesman Doug Heye said. ""Santorum does more interviews, not necessarily because he wants to, but that he has to,"" Heye said. This approach also has its drawbacks. In the days before the Michigan primary, Santorum was within striking distance of dealing Romney what could have been a death blow in his home state. Then Santorum, who should know better given his long history of dealing with a certain Google problem, blew up on Twitter. He accused the president of being a ""snob"" for wanting young people to go to college. He said he wanted to ""throw up"" over President John F. Kennedy's call for a separation of church and state. The comments were predictably reduced into 140-character tweet-bombs that detonated under the Michigan hopes of his insurgent campaign. Santorum would later chastise the free media for not covering the real issues voters care about. Message clarity, something Santorum lacked in those days before Michigan, may be one way to manage the chaos. ""You need a clear message across all mediums and be able to quickly dispense with any threats to that message,"" Huntsman's Miller said. For the most part, this is what works for Romney -- his embeds spend much of their time tweeting out the more benign details of his campaign stops -- the stagecrafting, the music, the campaign's message of the day. This is all appreciated by the campaign, whose staffers have privately told reporters they monitor tweets with great interest. But message discipline has its limits. Having had quite enough of Romney's silence, the embeds banded together in the quest for some kind of social media justice on Friday. After getting their quote from Romney, one of the embeds tweeted out a note of congratulations to her colleagues. That tweet was followed by a fair number of retweets.","Mitt Romney's nonresponse on the Limbaugh furor gained momentum on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to the horror of bringing a playoff system to the big boys of college football, there are several things for members of the Knee-Jerk Society of America to think about. The problem is, they don't wish to think. They prefer emotion. Mostly, they fume over the current system that chooses a national champion through a combination of polls and computers with the so-called Bowl Championship Series. They say a playoff system is the best way to determine a champion on the field, and they are correct. But only if you ignore things you have to ... think about. For instance: Name those screaming the loudest about a playoff system for the Alabamas, the Ohio States and the Southern Californias. Schedule of 2011-12 college bowl games . The fans? Yep, because they are, well, fans. The coaches? Uh-huh. In their minds, a playoff system gives them the chance to add millions to their millions. The media? Definitely. They have airwaves, cyberspace and newsprint to fill, and if you're ESPN or the networks, a playoff system gives you the chance to add billions to your billions. Guess who gets ignored? The players. Pro players get paid for their sacrifices regarding extra games, but college players don't. And that's just for starters. Consider that every team in the Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division 1-A) has about 120 players. On the high side, an average of five or six of those players make NFL training-camp rosters. Of the nearly 110 left, maybe 40 believe they should have made an NFL training-camp roster. So, a large portion of that 40 joins those five or six in spending more time studying playbooks than textbooks. That leaves roughly 70 student-athletes on a team each season doing whatever it takes to get a degree -- and it takes a lot for that group, even without an extra game or three. Just one extra game means a slew of more practices, film sessions and team meetings for those student-athletes. ""A playoff system certainly would have its challenges, and it's already a challenge now,"" said Roddy Jones, a four-year starter at running back for Georgia Tech. He is a three-time Academic All-Atlantic Coast Conference player, and he has earned his undergraduate degree in management along the way to seeking an MBA. Not only that, Jones is part of an advisory council involving Georgia Tech athletes and administrators. He said an average day for a football student-athlete can start as early as 6:30 a.m., stretch through the end of a tutoring session at 9 p.m. and continue with more studying at the dormitory. ""Time management is the biggest thing,"" Jones said. ""People just see the games on Saturdays, but we're practicing Monday through Friday, and we have classes every day as well. A traditional student has the weekend to get a project done. We don't have that liberty, because we're in a hotel on Fridays, getting ready for the games. It can be a mental grind."" And that's without a playoff system. That's also coming from Jones, among the elite of student-athletes, who added, ""A lot of those games with playoffs would come during finals weeks or at other times that are very stressful for any student, particularly for a student-athlete."" OK, so you couldn't care less whether Johnny can read or write. You just want to know whether Johnny can punt, pass or kick. Tell me this: A playoff system would have how many games, and who's to say it wouldn't keep expanding before expanding some more? While several athletics directors want a ""plus one"" approach featuring a championship game after the 35 bowl games, others want two semifinal games and then a championship game. President Obama wants eight teams playing three rounds. Washington State coach Mike Leach wants 64 teams. No doubt, others wouldn't mind putting all of the Football Bowl Subdivision's 120 teams in the postseason. Where would you play these games? The site of current bowl games, you say, or maybe NFL stadiums, neutral sites or various places on the dark side of the moon? How many -- if any -- of these locations would be available? If you use bowls, which ones? And since the bulk of the TV and advertising revenue would flow to playoff games, what would happen financially to the bulk of the bowls without playoff games? How would you choose the participants for a playoff system, and wouldn't that create more controversy? I know. They have a playoff system in college basketball called March Madness, but here's something else I know: The academic status of participating dribblers often has been a disaster. In fact, if the new academic rules that the NCAA adopted this fall were in place last spring, Connecticut wouldn't be allowed to defend its national championship. Connecticut barely would have made the tournament. I also know they have a playoff system for the lower levels of college football. The one for the Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division 1-AA) began November 26, and it will end with the championship game January 7. Here's something else I know: The last NCAA report on the financial status of its schools at the highest level was for the 2009-10 season, and it showed that only 22 out of those 120 athletics departments turned a profit. Which raises the question: How many football programs for those schools would agree to lose revenue by slicing regular-season games to keep a playoff system from lasting until Valentine's Day? Zero. Oh, and home attendance in the playoffs for teams at those lower levels is frequently lower than their regular-season games. Such was the case last season for traditional FCS powers Delaware and Appalachian State, and such is the case this year for North Dakota State, according to its sports information department. I say that because Georgia fans dominated the Georgia Dome this month for the Southeastern Conference title game. Their LSU counterparts were sparse. Word back in Baton Rouge was that LSU fans were saving their money for the Bowl Championship Series title game next week in New Orleans between LSU and Alabama. Which raises another question: How many folks would travel multiple times to see their team during a playoff system involving the big boys? The answer? Just leave the current system alone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Terence Moore.","A playoff system for college football would be a big mistake, says Terence Moore .
For one thing, student-athletes would have even less time for studying, he says .
Moore: Where would you play the games? And how would participants be chosen?
Home attendance in the playoffs for teams at lower levels is frequently low, Moore says ."
"(CNN) -- Twisted metal beams still jut from the top of Japan's Fukushima Daiichi stricken reactors, almost one year after a massive tsunami triggered nuclear meltdown. They remain as an eerie monument to the country's worst ever nuclear disaster, frozen in time by the dangers that surround the reactors and what's inside. The reactors at the northern Japanese plant were declared last December to be in cold shutdown, a term used to indicate that operations are under control and pose no immediate threat. Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at U.S. nuclear power plants, said in this instance the words ""cold shutdown"" are ""completely inappropriate"" to describe the situation at the Fukushima plant. Inside Fukushima's meltdown zone . ""There reactors are very much cold from a nuclear standpoint and from an energy standpoint, and the likelihood of it ever having another criticality or having another explosion is virtually zero,"" he said. ""But it's a consequence of the fact that they've now been shut down for a year, much more so than anything that TEPCO or that anybody else has ever done,"" he said, referring to the plant's operators Tokyo Electric Power Company. The biggest threat to the stability of the reactors, Friedlander said, is another earthquake or external event that causes a radioactive leak. ""The biggest real risk is that a pipe breaks and that hundreds of thousands of gallons of highly radioactive water ends up underground or ends up leeching back into the ocean or something like that. That's the real bottom line,"" he said. ""The chance of a massive contamination or a massive plume of radioactive contamination is almost zero,"" he added. On March 11, 2011 more than 15,000 people died after a magnitude-9.0 earthquake ruptured a 300 kilometer long fault stretching from the southern end of Japan's Ibaraki Prefecture to the middle of the Iwate Prefecture. The tremor generated a massive tsunami which smashed into the coast, swamping three prefectures including Fukushima, the site of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Three of the plant's six reactors suffered meltdowns despite frantic efforts to flood them with seawater to bring surging temperatures down. During a tour of the nuclear plant, manager Takeshi Takahashi told CNN's Kyung Lah that the biggest risk is if something goes wrong with the reactors. The nuclear fuel needs constant cooling. Huge tanks around the site hold water contaminated with radiation and finding more space to store the water is a constant challenge. ""The reactors are no more or no less stable than they were in April of last year,"" Friedlander said. ""They fundamentally continue to be reliant on a feed and bleed cooling mechanism and anything can happen. Another earthquake could happen; another tsunami could happen."" Nearly 700 aftershocks of magnitude 5 or greater have been registered since last year's quake, according to a report released in January by the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute. The report warned that there was a 70% chance that a magnitude-7 quake would hit Tokyo's metropolitan area within four years. The probability rose to 98% probability within the next 30 years, it added. Tokyo see high quake probability, scientists warn . Friedlander said that while the ticking bomb nature of the Fukushima disaster ""very appropriately"" focused attention on stabilizing the site, a year later the world should be paying more attention to the inevitable spread of radioactive material. ""I think that the reason why people don't give it attention is because they say, you know, the levels of concentration are very low, so even if you did become contaminated the risk to you is actually quite low, which is true,"" he said. ""But again, when you start exposing millions and millions and millions of people to very low levels of concentration, it's inevitable that it's going to have an impact."" Last week, fish and plankton collected from the Pacific Ocean near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were said to contain elevated levels of radioactive materials. However, the levels were below those that pose a threat to public health, according to Nicholas Fisher, a marine science professor at New York's Stony Brook University. The samples were taken in June 2011, outside the 30-kilometer (19-mile) exclusion zone around the plant, at points in and around the Kuroshio Current, the Pacific version of the Gulf Stream. Fisher said that the contaminants were more likely to have settled in coastal sediments, of which little is known. ""There's a lot of key missing information about the sediments,"" he said.","Threats remain despite cold shutdown at Fukushima plant .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- A grand jury has indicted four people in the shooting death of a woman during what police say was a Ku Klux Klan initiation rite in the Louisiana woods, St. Tammany Parish prosecutors said. Raymond ""Chuck"" Foster is reputed to be the leader of the Klan Group. He was among the four indicted. Raymond ""Chuck"" Foster, 44, was indicted on second-degree murder charges Wednesday in the November death of Cynthia Lynch, 43, of Tulsa, Oklahoma. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, said Rick Wood, spokesman for the St. Tammany Parish district attorney's office. ""That's what he was charged with,"" Wood told reporters on Wednesday. ""The grand jury agreed with that charge."" Two other men, including Foster's son, Shane Foster, were indicted on a count of obstruction of justice, and a woman, Danielle Jones, was indicted on one count of being an accessory after the fact. Wood said Thursday Foster's case was assigned to one judge and the others' cases were assigned to another. Foster is scheduled to be arraigned March 3, he said, and the others are set for arraignment next week. Eight people initially were arrested in the case. The remaining four were not indicted. ""Haven't seen one like this,"" Wood said Wednesday. ""We've had a lot of high-profile cases, but not one like this. ... As (district attorney) Walter Reed said, it will be to the max. They will be prosecuted to the max."" Authorities said Lynch was recruited over the Internet and took a bus to Slidell, Louisiana, where she was met by two Klan members. They then went to a campsite in the woods near Sun, Louisiana, about 60 miles north of New Orleans, where they met other members of the group, police said. During the initiation rite, members of the Klan group, which calls itself the Sons of Dixie, shaved Lynch's head, according to Capt. George Bonnett of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Department and Sheriff Jack Strain, who spoke to CNN in November. After 24 hours of drills, including chanting and running with torches, she asked to be taken to town. An argument began, authorities said, and the group's leader, Raymond Foster, pushed Lynch to the ground and shot her without warning. Lynch apparently wanted to leave because she was homesick, investigators found after talking to her family members. After the shooting, ""Foster, we believe, removed a knife from his pocket and rolled over the victim and began a process of trying to remove the bullet from her body ... because he was trying to destroy evidence where law enforcement would not be able to piece these things together,"" Strain said. Police believe other members of the Sons of Dixie helped cover up the slaying on Foster's behalf, Strain said at the time, including burning some of Lynch's personal items. ""We're up to the challenge,"" Wood told reporters after the indictments were handed up Wednesday. ""This office is ready to proceed and take care of business."" Authorities received the initial tip about the slaying from a convenience store clerk, after two group members went into the store and asked him if he knew how to get bloodstains out of their clothes. The clerk told them he did not, then called police after they left. Officials tracked down those two members and arrested them, then arrested others at the campsite and Foster. All the members surrendered without incident, police said. Investigators found Confederate battle flags, Ku Klux Klan banners, five Klan robes and an Imperial Wizard robe at the campsite, authorities said. Lynch's body was found under loose brush along a road several miles from the campsite. Raymond Foster has a history of Ku Klux Klan activity dating back seven years, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a Montgomery, Alabama-based organization that tracks hate groups.","Police say Cynthia Lynch of Tulsa shot as she tried to leave KKK rite .

"Madrid (CNN) -- The Prado Museum put on display for public viewing Tuesday a restored version of what is thought to be the earliest known copy of Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" masterpiece, which hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris. Many copies of ""Mona Lisa"" were painted years after the fact, but this copy is different, experts say, because evidence shows it was painted at the same time and in the same studio as the original masterpiece, probably by one of Leonardo's assistants or pupils. The copy shows the same woman and the same landscape, the Prado Museum said in a statement. But the restored copy may depict the woman in a more youthful and vibrant fashion, some art experts said, because the original masterpiece has been dulled by layers of cracked varnish and there are no known plans to restore it as well. ""This copy is now one of the most important sources of information for working procedures in Leonardo's studios,"" the Prado said in a statement. ""The first thing to notice is that the copy is in remarkably good condition and we think that it's a rather faithful rendition of the original,"" Gabriele Finaldi, the Prado's deputy director told CNN. ""I think it has a lot to offer regarding the understanding of the original in the Louvre, particularly in the landscape and in the head dress, and details of the face and hands."" The copy will be on display at the Prado through March 12, when it will be sent to the Louvre to be shown in an exhibition on Leonardo, starting March 29. Both the original and the copy were painted 500 years ago, but what art experts consider to be the exciting details about the copy occurred only recently. The copy has been in Spanish art collections for centuries, first in the royal collection, and then in the Prado's collection starting in 1819, when the museum opened, the Prado statement said. At a packed news conference at the museum, Prado officials said the ""Mona Lisa"" copy underwent a big change in the 18th century, when someone ordered the colorful background landscape to be painted over in black. Art historians know that some other paintings underwent similar transformations, with backgrounds being obscured. In the case of the ""Mona Lisa"" copy, the painted-over version left just the young woman in view, with none of the tell-tale background that could link it more closely to the masterpiece. This portrait was actually on display for years at the Prado, without anyone realizing what was hidden, museum officials said. Two years ago, the Louvre asked the Prado to study this portrait with the aim of getting it on loan for the Leonardo exhibit to start late next month, Prado officials said. The Prado restoration workshop began a series of painstaking tests on the copy, including chemical analysis and infrared imaging, which suggested the black paint was covering up some earlier part of the painting. The painting was cleaned of oxidized varnish and then very small portions of the black were removed at the edges, and those sections were compared to the original masterpiece in the Louvre. As positive matches occurred -- sections of landscape in the original matching newly uncovered sections of landscape in the copy -- more of the black was removed, until it was finally revealed to be a contemporary copy. Prado officials said much more study will now be done on the copy, including trying to figure out exactly who painted it. There are few likely candidates -- people who were working in Da Vinci's workshop at the time -- but art experts are not yet sure which one might be the artist. The copy will go to the Louvre as part of the ""Leonardo's Final Masterpiece"" exhibition, which focuses on his work, ""The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.""","The painting is believed to be the earliest known copy of the ""Mona Lisa""

"(CNN) -- TIME magazine's cover story, which hit the newsstand Thursday, argues that Latino voters will cast the deciding vote in the upcoming election. After watching the Republican candidates lock the kryptonite that is the immigration issue around their necks during the Arizona debate, my bet is that President Barack Obama could win another term -- even if he loses key swing states such as Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin -- but he must make sure he accomplishes one thing first: Connect with Latinos. Republicans have not connected with Hispanics; the candidates' approaches to immigration are not compelling and lack substance, from talk of double 30-foot electrified fences to anchor babies and self-deportation. In fact, it could very well be that the 20 Arizona Latino voters on the cover of TIME and half a million more will turn out to vote in Arizona and flip the state to Obama. Obama comes into the election with 196 electoral votes from safe Democratic states. If he takes Arizona and if Hispanic voters help him flip Missouri, which McCain won by fewer than 4,000 votes, and help him retain Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico and North Carolina, then Obama wins with 279 electoral votes, nine more than the 270 needed. If he can retain Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia or Wisconsin, also populated with many Latino swing voters, then he could win in a landslide. It is clear, then, that connecting with Latino voters could very well be a tipping point for the president; the question is how to make that connection. In his book ""The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation,"" Drew Westen convincingly argues that ""people vote for the candidate who elicits the right feelings, not the candidate who presents the best arguments."" Beyond the shared concern for economic growth, jobs, education and health care, Latinos are focused on immigration because the majority of the undocumented workers living here are from Latin America. This is an issue that resonates at a deeply emotional level with Latinos, whether they are descendants of Spanish colonists or a recently arrived Mexican sleeping on a cousin's couch. Thus to really, deeply connect with Hispanic voters, any candidate needs to address the immigration issue by supporting comprehensive immigration reform and the Dream Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for those who earn a college degree or serve two years in the military. This is a vital first step to earning the trust of Hispanic voters, who understand that the country needs strong border security but also know that we need a fair way to deal with the nearly 10 million economic refugees who are working in this country and contributing to our society. It's a matter of respect. So how does Obama -- who has a dubious record himself on immigration -- win the Latino vote? First he wins the ground war in the battleground states, which is door-to-door combat. Next he outspends Republicans in Spanish-language media, just like he did John McCain in 2008, by five to one. It's no coincidence that on Tuesday, Obama did an interview with L.A.-based ""Piolin,"" the most influential Spanish-language radio personality in the country. The president reassured Latinos that he is strongly committed to passing comprehensive immigration reform and lambasted the Republican Party for its extreme views and intransigence on the issue. Hispanics want to feel they are voting for an authentic leader. Hispanics don't have to agree with every position Obama takes, but they must believe in and identify with his worldview. He needs to explain that the Democratic Party is a welcoming place for Hispanics, that his world view of America is that of a caring, responsible, family and that his political ideals are based on empathy and fairness. Getting these ideas across to Latinos is vital to securing their votes. Once Obama has established a deep emotional connection with Latinos, he can connect directly to the heart of Latino voters with three simple messages: . 1. The economy and jobs. Under Obama's leadership, an economy that was losing 500,000 jobs a month in the final months of 2008 is now gaining more than 200,000 jobs per month. His policies are working; they just need more time. 2. Health care. Despite unanimous opposition from Republicans, Obama fulfilled his promise of making health care available to all Americans. Now 32 million more Americans -- including Hispanics -- will be able to afford insurance for the first time. 3. Education. The president doubled the government's investment in scholarships and financial aid, making college more affordable to millions of Americans. Now students from working-class Hispanic families can go to college and get good jobs. On the contrary, Republicans may blow hard about their understanding and affection for Hispanics, munching on burritos in the barrio on the campaign trail, but the evidence of authenticity of leadership and the strong record crucial to the Latino vote are just not there. The refusal of all the GOP candidates to really look at immigration and offer a plan -- despite the glad-handing and tepid avowals of commitment -- makes it clear that the GOP just doesn't have the deep connection with Latinos necessary to pull off a win in November. Join the conversation at Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"(CNN) -- One more time, Whitney Houston brought a crowd to its feet. ""I Will Always Love You"" had earned record of the year at the 1994 Grammy festivities, with the accompanying ""The Bodyguard"" soundtrack taking home best album. But for all the awards that Houston earned that night, it was her voice that resonated most -- as it did throughout her career. The iconic songstress' range and power were on display once again Sunday night, echoing through the packed Staples Center moments after the music world's luminaries bowed their heads in prayer in honor of her death. By the time a replay of her 1994 performance was complete, the audience's applause gave way to an emotional standing ovation. A day earlier, Houston was pronounced dead in her fourth floor room at a Beverly Hills, California, hotel. The world may wait as many as eight weeks -- when results from toxicology and other tests should be in -- to learn what happened, with Assistant Chief Ed Winter of the Los Angeles County Coroner's office saying little Sunday besides ""foul play is not suspected."" Headlines in recent years about Houston have tended to focus more on her battles with drug addiction and her relationship with her ex-husband, ""New Edition"" performer Bobby Brown, than her musical accomplishments. Yet recollections of her enormous talent took center stage Sunday night in Los Angeles, as did the six-time Grammy winner's membership in the music world's ""family."" LL Cool J, host of the 54th annual Grammy Awards, spoke right away to Houston's personal and professional legacy, soon after taking the stage following an opening performance by Bruce Springsteen. ""Tonight, we ask ourselves: How do we speak to this time? To this day? There is no way around this. We've had a death in our family,"" he said. The rapper and actor then offered his prayer, thanking God ""for sharing our sister Whitney with us."" ""And although she's gone too soon, we remain truly blessed to have been touched by her beautiful spirit and to have her lasting legacy of music to cherish and share forever,"" he said. During the show, stars of past and present -- from Bruno Mars to Stevie Wonder -- celebrated the late singer. The sentiments voiced Sunday night echoed those that have been offered ever since news broke of Houston's death from close friends, musical icons and everyday fans who never met the iconic performer but were moved by her music. Then, after a memorial honoring other stars from Amy Winehouse to Clarence Clemons who also died this past year -- and nearly three hours after LL Cool J promised the Grammys ""will remember you the best way we know how: with a song"" -- Jennifer Hudson appeared under a bright, solitary spotlight. Wearing a black sleeveless dress and anchored firmly in the middle of the stage, the Oscar and two-time Grammy winner offered her own rendition of ""I Will Always Love You."" Twice during the song, the crowd burst into applause. Hudson offered one small embellishment, changing a lyric to sing: ""Whitney, we will always love you.""","NEW: Jennifer Hudson sings ""I Will Always Love You"" in a Grammy tribute .

"(CNN) -- A last-minute Leigh Halfpenny penalty gave Wales a narrow 23-21 Six Nations victory against Ireland in Dublin, their third successive victory over their opponents. With Wales trailing by a point, Ireland's Stephen Ferris was penalized for a spear tackle and Halfpenny kept his nerve to slot home the decisive kick. ""That was the hardest kick I've had to take in all my life and I was very pleased to see it go over and get the win for Wales,"" Halfpenny told reporters. France beat Italy in Six Nations opener . Ireland took an early lead through Jonathan Sexton's penalty, but Wales recovered and centre Jonathan Davies touched down in the corner for the first of his two tries. Wales failed to build on that advantage with Rhys Priestland missing two kicks, one in front of the posts, although Sexton followed suit when he squandered a simple penalty for the home side. However, Ireland took a 10-5 advantage when hooker Rory Best went over for a converted try from Tommy Bowe's pass. Sexton and Halfpenny then swapped penalties to make the score 13-8 before Davies was released by George North to score his second try of the game, converted by Halfpenny, to put Wales ahead again. Another Sexton penalty turned the match 16-15 in Ireland's direction and a Bowe try made it 21-15 to the home side. However, Sexton missed the resulting conversion and North gave Wales hope by going over in the left hand corner to make it 21-20. And although Halfpenny missed the conversion, he made no mistake with his penalty to hand Wales a stunning late victory. The result leaves Wales third in the Six Nations table, behind France and England who also won their opening matches.","Wales defeat Ireland 23-21 in their Six Nations opener on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Bahrain's Formula One organizers insist that the Gulf state's grand prix race will go ahead as planned in April, despite recent fears that its political situation has not improved. A group of British peers appealed for the race to be called off in an open letter to The Times newspaper last week, saying that the same problems of social instability prevail as when last year's event was called off. However, a spokesman for the Bahrain International Circuit (BIC) insisted on Tuesday -- the anniversary of the ""Day of Rage"" protests against the ruling monarchy -- that the April 22 event will take place. ""The calendar was confirmed for 2012 at the end of last year and Bahrain has a place on that calendar,"" the spokesman told CNN under condition of anonymity. He said motorsport's governing body, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), had been in regular contact with the BIC. ""We are entirely confident that the race can be and will be an excellent event. The FIA has been taking the situation seriously for a long time,"" he said. ""Jean Todt (FIA president) has been visiting Bahrain himself, keeping in constant contact. The FIA has said that there is no reason why the grand prix should not go ahead."" The spokesman said although there had been continuing problems in Bahrain over the past 12 months, the riots in the main city of Manama were smaller than those which took place in Britain's capital London last August. ""When I was out there two or three weeks ago it was very quiet ... There is no doubt that there have been some protests,"" he said. ""There's no doubt that there have been some small riots, nothing like on the scale that we saw in London. There have been some public order disturbances, but on the kind of scale that Britain has endured many times."" Bahrain is scheduled to be the fourth race in the 2012 F1 season, which starts on March 18 with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. The spokesman said the BIC is ""absolutely confident"" that the Bahrain circuit will be safe for the drivers and teams.

"(CNN) -- The chief executive of English Premier League club Arsenal has urged the team's supporters to get behind under-fire coach Arsene Wenger. Ivan Gazidis told the north London team's fans that Wenger was the best man for the job on the day that Arsenal announced pre-tax profits of $78 million for the six months until the end of November. The club's healthy financial situation off the field is diluted by a precarious one on it, because despite Sunday's 5-2 thrashing of local rivals Tottenham, the Gunners are in a battle to finish fourth and claim England's final, lucrative European Champions League spot. Wenger, from France, has delivered three Premier League titles and four FA Cups during his 15-year reign and has never failed to qualify for the continent's most prestigious club competition. Arsenal fight back to win sensational north London derby . But the team have been below par this season, and are in fourth place only on goal difference, ahead of London rivals Chelsea, and 17 points off leaders Manchester City. ""We hear the noise, we understand the concern of the fans, we know that there are issues, we know we're not where we want to be,"" Gazidis told Arsenal's official website on Monday. ""But I can tell you that this team, our manager, the players, are absolutely united in what we have to do for the rest of the season, which is to finish in the top four. It's very much in our hands. ""Victory through harmony. The strength of this club has always been its unity and our fans and our players need to come together in this fight for the rest of the season.'' The early-season sales of Cesc Fabregas to Barcelona and Samir Nasri to Manchester City helped Arsenal post such healthy profits. During the same period in 2010 the club made a loss of $9.6 million. Gazidis confirmed there was money available to spend on players but said that UEFA's new Financial Fair Play regulations, which aim to make football clubs more sustainable and live within their means, would help moderate a voracious market. Should Manchester City accept Tevez's apology? ""We have a healthy cash balance of Â£115 million ($181 million) for the half year. But it's important to understand that not all that money's available to invest in transfers. We have running costs of the club, player salaries and so on, so that amount goes down during the year,"" Gazidis said. ""We also have to keep something in reserve in case things don't go our way. There is money available, we don't talk about an exact figure -- and there's a very good reason why we don't put an exact figure on that -- because it would impact on our negotiating position. ""We have to invest efficiently, we have to invest sensibly. That doesn't mean we get every decision right -- we don't. But we do get the majority of them right and that's been one of the secrets of Arsenal's success over a long period of time."" Meanwhile, the English FA has charged three players with making alleged homophobic statements on social networking site Twitter. Manchester United's Federico Macheda, who is on loan at Queens Park Rangers, Newcastle's Nile Ranger and Manny Smith of third division Walsall stand accused of bringing the game into disrepute. An FA statement read: ""The charge is that the players acted in a way which was improper and/or brought the game into disrepute. It is further alleged that the breach included a reference to a person's or persons' sexual orientation."" The trio have until Wednesday to respond to the charges.","Arsenal's chief exec tells club's fans to back manager Arsene Wenger .

"(CNN) -- A Michigan woman who won the lottery but continued to receive food assistance from the state government has had her benefits pulled, officials said. Amanda Clayton hit it big playing the Michigan Lottery. Like many winners, she used her $1 million prize to buy a new house. But the Lincoln Park, Michigan, resident continued to receive money in another form -- $200 a month in state food assistance, according to CNN Detroit affiliate WDIV. Her story made headlines, and on Thursday, the state's Department of Human Services announced that she is no longer getting the benefits. According to Michigan law, welfare recipients must report any changes in assets or income to the agency within 10 days. The department ""relies on clients being forthcoming about their actual financial status. If they are not, and continue to accept benefits, they may face criminal investigation and be required to pay back those benefits,"" Director Maura Corrigan said in a statement. She said the agency supports new legislation that would verify whether lottery winners receive state benefits. ""I thought that they would cut me off, but since they didn't, I thought, maybe, it was OK because I'm not working,"" Clayton, 24, told WDIV when it asked whether it was appropriate for her to receive the money. A state lawmaker is trying to stop such assistance, which is not illegal. He says the food assistance should not go to those who have found riches through the lottery. ""We need to continue to protect our taxpayers' dollars ... and taxpayer dollars should be going to those who really do need assistance,"" Michigan Rep. Dale Zorn of Ida Township told HLN's Vinnie Politan on Wednesday. In October, Clayton walked away with $1 million in the ""Make Me Rich!"" lottery game show. She also bought a car, WDIV reported. After taking a lump sum and paying taxes, the unemployed woman said she ended up with just more than $500,000. Asked if she had the right to the public assistance money, Clayton answered, ""I kind of do. I have no income, and I have bills to pay. I have two houses."" Zorn said the state House has passed bills on the matter. One would require a state agency to conduct an assets test if a citizen wins more than $1,000 in lottery earnings. ""That will trigger whether or not the people are eligible to receive public assistance."" The legislature has not approved any final measures. Clayton told WDIV she had wanted to continue using a food-assistance card until it is cut off. ""It's hard. I am struggling.""","NEW: A Michigan woman who won a $1 million lottery prize is no longer receiving food aid .

"(CNN) -- CNN Hero Dan Wallrath is ramping up his efforts to build mortgage-free homes for U.S. troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. His group, Operation Finally Home, has built 17 houses to date, and 19 more are under construction. Just this month, the organization broke ground on its first home for a military widow. CNN's Christie O'Reilly spoke with Wallrath, one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2010, about the unique way he and his group surprised the widow. They also talked about a new film that reveals the hurdles Wallrath faced as the child of an alcoholic. ""Deep in the Heart,"" starring Jon Gries and Val Kilmer, is a true story about the struggles and ultimate redemption of Wallrath's father, who has donated millions of dollars toward scholarships in Texas. Below are excerpts from the interview. Christie O'Reilly: Sara Wood, a widow from Houston, Texas, didn't know that you had selected her to receive a home. How did you surprise her with the news? Dan Wallrath: We surprised her during halftime at a Houston Texans game. We got there and we started talking to her, and she's telling us about her husband and how big of fans they were. He was buried in his dress blues, but underneath his dress blues he was buried in (wide receiver) Andre Johnson's jersey. We didn't even know it, and the Texans had no clue. O'Reilly: Wow. That must have made it that much more special. What was the moment of surprise like? Wallrath: She just broke down, and it just tore me out. Tears just started flowing from everybody. I tell you, it was amazing. When we gave the home away, you could hear a pin drop in the stadium. And afterward, I knew several people all around in the stadium in different places, and they called me (and said) everybody was crying. So that was really a neat, neat deal. See video of the moment . She had just lost Scott a couple weeks before we gave her the home. And it was just so emotional because she was just trying to get her life together. ... We broke ground on the house, and it's moving right along. O'Reilly: I understand you also have a home delivery planned for Memorial Day weekend? Wallrath: It is for Shaun Meadows. He's a double amputee. He was with Air Force Special Services. He's just a great young man. He's married, got one little boy. I tell you this guy's amazing. He doesn't let anything hold him back. When he was in service, he had bought some property in Tennessee and he was planning on building a home there. But it was becoming harder and harder because of his disability. So we came along and surprised him. He already had his (architectural) plans, so we're building his dream home. O'Reilly: What are some of the challenges you'll face as your organization expands this year? Wallrath: We're looking at doubling (the number of homes) by the end of this year. It looks like we're on track. But we're still looking for monetary contributions and also materials. We've developed new relationships with (a flooring company) this year; they furnish all the flooring, wood, tile, carpet and things like that for all our homes. These relationships make it easier and easier for us to put these homes together. O'Reilly: Philanthropy is in your family, and that's part of what the film ""Deep in the Heart"" touches upon. What did you get from your dad when it comes to giving back? Wallrath: I guess it's just the spirit of, once you reach your goals or ... once you are blessed with certain things, you're (not) supposed to hold on to it. I think God gives you things to help others. O'Reilly: Still, the film focuses on some difficult issues. How have you seen it affect audiences? Wallrath: The movie touches so many lives because the movie is about our family, but mostly about Dad and his struggle with alcoholism. He quit drinking and became successful and started giving back. But along that path, you have children of alcoholics -- myself, my sisters and brothers -- and what they go through. Then you have a spouse of an alcoholic and what she goes through dealing with the alcoholism. Then you have the alcoholic himself; you see what struggles he has to overcome, that demon. And then at the same time, I had a sister (who), when she was 30 and had a 2-year-old son, died of cancer. And so this is all in the movie. I've had so many people come up to me, and they had a sister or brother or someone die of cancer and the movie affected them because they were thinking of that. People come up to me that were children of alcoholics and say: ""Hey, that was my life except for the getting rich part. The bad part -- that was my part."" So it really affects a lot of people. ... Usually when you have abuse and alcoholism and things like that, it passes from one generation to another. But in our family it didn't. And I'm so proud of my brother and sisters that that didn't go on. O'Reilly: What do you hope people will take away from the film? Wallrath: When I was in the position, I just didn't think there was any hope. ... I just want them to realize -- the kids that see this movie and they have parents like that -- (that) if they can just have faith in God and just keep doing the right things and hang in there, that everything can be OK. And just because you start out life that way doesn't mean you have to end life that way. O'Reilly: You are evidence of that. Has Operation Finally Home become what you'd hoped? Wallrath: Yes, it really has. I guess when we first started, I had no idea that we'd be where we're at today. As we grow, I can see where our goal of building 100 homes every year is getting closer and closer. I think we're about three years away from hitting that goal, maybe less. That'd be amazing. There are just so many of those young families out there that need our help, and we're going as fast as we can.","A military widow was recently given a free house by Operation Finally Home .

"(CNN) -- Ezequiel Lavezzi scored twice and strike partner Edinson Cavani also found the net as Napoli recovered from going a goal behind to beat Chelsea 3-1 in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie. After Arsenal's 4-0 thumping in Milan last week, Chelsea had an ideal opportunity to restore some pride for English clubs against Serie A opposition. And they got off to a superb start on a wet evening in southern Italy, by taking a 27th-minute lead. Villas Boas - Chelsea owners backing me in private . Dean Sturridge broke on the right for the visitors but his ball into the penalty area should have been dealt with by the Napoli defense. However, Paolo Cannavaro sliced his attempted clearance up in the air and Spanish international Juan Mata was lurking behind the defender to side-foot his shot past goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis. However, both defenses looked vulnerable in difficult conditions and it was no surprise when the home side leveled just 11 minutes later. Argentine striker Lavezzi collected the ball on the edge of the box and jinked inside Chelsea's Raul Meireles before curling a sublime shot into the corner of Peter Cech's net. And, Napoli completed their turnaround in stoppage time at the end of the first half when Gokhan Inler's deep cross was bundled home by Cavani, who had drifted in behind the Chelsea defense. Both sides wasted opportunities to score in an end-to-end second half, but it was Napoli who found the net again with a third goal in the 65th minute. David Luiz failed to deal with a long ball out of the Napoli defense and allowed Cavani to nip ahead of him. The Uruguayan did superbly to steady himself and slide the ball across for the on-rushing Lavezzi to stroke him his second to double Napoli's lead. A poor night for Chelsea could have become worse late on, when Ashley Cole's goalline clearance deprived Christian Maggio of scoring a fourth goal which would surely have sealed Napoli's qualification into the quarterfinals. Chelsea have now gone five matches without a victory as speculation continues over the future of under-pressure manager Andre Villas Boas. And the result also means the very real possibility of no English sides reaching the last eight of the competition for the first time since 1996.","Ezequiel Lavezzi nets a double as Napoli come from behind to defeat Chelsea 3-1 in Italy .

"(CNN) -- After a day of recovery for battered regions of the Midwest and South, a line of storms stretching from Illinois to Louisiana will bring the threat of tornadoes and severe weather Friday, forecasters said. Areas most at risk for twisters are southern Indiana, southern Ohio, most of Kentucky, central Tennessee, northeastern Mississippi and northwestern Alabama. The storms are forecast to rapidly develop around noon ET Friday. The most likely window for tornadoes will be between 4 p.m. and 8 pm. ET Friday, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. There is the potential for widespread damaging wind gusts, large hail and violent tornadoes in some areas. Storms will begin to weaken during the late evening as they move eastward toward the Appalachians. The severe weather threat will diminish overnight Friday into Saturday morning, Morris said. The tornado outbreak that began Tuesday night left 13 dead across Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Tennessee and battered parts of Kentucky as well. The latest death was reported in Kansas, where authorities said 53-year-old Richard Slade died Thursday from injuries suffered when a tornado struck Harveyville on Tuesday night. Slade had been airlifted to a nearby Topeka hospital after being pulled from the wreckage of his home. The decision was made to take him off life support, officials said. National Guard troops helped police and sheriff's deputies direct traffic and patrol streets in stricken areas of Missouri and Kentucky, while those who survived began the task of cleaning up. In Harrisburg, Illinois, where the highest death toll occurred, a tree smashed in the front window of Chris and Alice Retzloff's home before dawn Wednesday. But their neighbor's house was ""pretty much gone,"" Chris Retzloff told CNN's ""Starting Point."" ""Our damage was minimal compared to this,"" his wife added. ""We have a basement, and we went in our basement and huddled together with our dogs and the sirens went off,"" she said. ""The wind was just immense, the sound, and then the next siren went off, and there was just this incredible pressure that we all had on us."" Four women and two men died in Harrisburg, about 30 miles north of the Kentucky border. The tornado that struck it had a preliminary rating of EF4, the second most powerful on the rating scale, according to the National Weather Service. The twister appeared to have been on the ground for several miles, said Harrisburg Mayor Eric Gregg, and the path of destruction was about three or four football fields wide. Sheriff's deputes said about 100 people were injured and between 250 and 300 houses were damaged or destroyed. This Just In: Harrisburg's path of destruction . Darrell Osman lost his mother to the storm. After the twister struck, he ran to her house, only to find nothing left. ""Her house was literally gone,"" Osman said. He found his mother in an ambulance, but she passed away later at a hospital. In Washington, the White House said President Barack Obama called the governors of six states affected by the storms -- Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana -- ""to offer condolences and assistance as necessary."" One person died in each of three towns in southern Missouri where the twisters struck -- Buffalo, Puxico and Cassville -- while another three died in two east-central Tennessee counties, authorities in those states reported. A smaller tornado caused significant damage in the music resort city of Branson, Missouri. The city's entertainment district, which boasts 50 theaters, had five or six damaged; of the city's 200 hotels, 15 had significant damage, Branson Mayor Raeanne Presley said. But she told CNN, ""We'll be open for business in short order, and we will be helping those who suffered damage to rebuild."" Presley took cover with her family in the basement before immediately going out to survey the damage. Tourist town of Branson, Missouri, hit . An EF2 tornado smashed at least seven miles of the city's commercial strip, leaving 33 people hurt, most with minor to moderate injuries. The city's convention center and an attached Hilton were damaged, as was a portion of Branson Landing, a large shopping and entertainment complex. City Administrator Dean Kruithof said about five or six of the city's roughly 40 theaters were damaged. iReport: Branson Hilton windows blown out . Two tornadoes were confirmed in Tennessee's Cumberland and DeKalb counties, between Nashville and Knoxville. The one that struck Cumberland County, where two people died, was an EF2 with top winds of around 125 mph, the weather service reported Thursday evening. The remaining fatality was from an EF1 twister with top winds around 90 mph, according to forecasters.

"(CNN) -- Seal admits to Piers Morgan that the hardest thing he ever had to do was sit his children down and tell them that their parents were parting ways. ""It doesn't really make sense,"" Seal said, referring to the recent bombshell news of his separation from his wife of more than six years, supermodel Heidi Klum. ""The truth of the matter is all I can tell you most sincerely is that it wasn't any one particular thing."" The London-born musician, 48, whose full name is Seal Henry Olusegun Olumide Adeola Samuel, is a guest on Friday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Seal and Klum have gone public stating their wish to handle the separation with honor and dignity, and the R&B singer admitted he is surprised that the relationship took a left turn. When rumors began swirling that Klum filed for divorce as a result of Seal's ""volcanic"" temper, the musician told the CNN host he checked out an online article about his so-called temper problem, he said, in the interest of shielding his children from ""outside negativity."" (He and Klum lovingly refer to their four offspring as ""the United Nations of Children."") The article included a video clip of what appeared to be Seal shouting. ""People want to sensationalize things,"" Seal said. ""That's just the nature of the business."" But Seal explained that ""in actual fact, I don't even think I was shouting, but I raised my voice at a reporter. It was an incident where we were walking through an airport in Los Angeles, and I had my son and my daughter in either hand, and we were swarmed by 15 to 20 paparazzi in the airport, you know? And one of them hit my son in the head with a camera lens. And I obviously said something to the reporter, you know, and then of course I become the angry stereotype, you know. I become the rock star, the angry rock star with a hot temper."" Seal, who has yet to take off his wedding band, told the CNN host that he wears his ring ""because I'm still married to this incredible woman. It stands for respect. It stands for loyalty. It stands for incredible memories."" Does Seal believe the relationship can be salvaged? ""Never say never,"" Seal told the CNN host. ""I can't speak for my wife, and I'm not going to sit here and BS you and tell you we haven't had problems. Of course we've had problems -- otherwise why are we splitting up?"" Seal was adamant, however, when he told Morgan, ""My love for her has not waned one iota."" The musician said that Klum made him ""a better man,"" describing his wife as ""the most fantastic woman I've ever met, and I still believe that now, as I did eight years ago, the day I met her."" That's not to say that Seal's outlook is unduly optimistic. ""We are going to separate,"" he said. ""We may become legally separated. Who knows if it makes either of us happy? We may even become divorced. I can't look into the future, but I can say that we will always be the greatest of friends."" Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- ""Mass Effect 3,"" the final installment in the tale of Commander Shepard and his fight to save the universe, brings the series to a resounding and satisfying crescendo with tight combat, excellent storytelling and majestic visual effects. Released in the United States on Tuesday, the game finds Shepard once again facing off against the Reapers, a race of sentient machines bent on eliminating all intelligent life in the universe. This time, the Reapers have come for Earth and Shepard must rally alien races from around the Milky Way to destroy this mechanical menace once and for all. As in other ""Mass Effect"" games, players take on the role of Shepard and have many options to craft him (or her) any way they want. Six different classes, from soldier to sentinel, allow players to emphasize different strengths and powers -- including ""biotic"" telekinetic powers. More inclined to straight-up combat? Choose a soldier or infiltrator. Would rather use the aforementioned biotics? Try being an adept or engineer. If you are looking for a good blend, choose a vanguard or sentinel. The options allow players to find a character that best suits their style of play. How you play also affects character development. As in previous games, the way Shepard talks to and treats others is measured in ""paragon/renegade"" bonuses. Being helpful or friendly raises your ""paragon"" rating while being abrasive or uncaring raises your ""renegade"" score. Both affect how you are treated by other characters in the future and can definitely alter events later in the game. All those options create the character that is cast into an epic story that has been eight years in the making. Players who have played ""Mass Effect 2"" can import characters from older games, allowing pre-existing story lines to continue and for choices made in those games to be reflected in the new one. New players will get into the major plot lines quickly and easily, though, and won't feel like they are missing anything. The game will have players hopping around the galaxy as Shepard recruits allies and builds up supplies from the multitude of races in the Milky Way. Of course, both the Reapers and Cerberus, a terrorist organization bent on human supremacy at any cost, cause problems for Shepard and his crew along the way. Old friends return, new alliances are made and players will make choices that determine their ultimate success or failure in defeating the Reapers. Despite all the side missions and interactions, the main point remains taking back Earth. Planet-scanning for ""treasure"" returns, but is vastly improved over what it was in ""Mass Effect 2."" Rather than having to survey and mine each planet for resources that may or may not be there, players can scan the system and find loot much faster than before. The treasure can be war assets (which are important in the final scenario), artifacts that can be sold or traded, intelligence about different factions or fuel for your spacecraft -- a welcome improvement from an experienced player's perspective. Invariably, there will be combat. Whether you choose to concentrate on biotic powers or weaponry, you are going to have to pick up a gun and shoot. The game offers a good selection of pistols, shotguns, rifles and sniper rifles, which are fully customizable with add-ons that grant better accuracy, more ammo-space or extra damage to certain types of enemies. Add in biotic abilities that grant other advantages and you are ready to take on the galaxy -- literally. The ammo is parsed out with thermal clips and is interchangeable between weapons, which is really helpful when you run out of one type of ammo. A single ammo pickup fills up all your weapons and ammo can easily be found on dead enemies or sitting on shelves. Shepard isn't alone, either. Along the way, friends and comrades will join his quest. Two are selected for each mission. They also have special powers that can be used in concert with Shepard's own abilities to devastating effect. Each potential squadmate falls into a particular class (soldier, engineer, etc.), so players can select those that either complement or contrast with their own abilities based on the mention. Plus, the sidekicks are often good for funny banter. The environments are rich and varied. Scenarios look unique from planet to planet. The artwork is detailed and the universe feels alive. Other races have their own unique looks, not simply appearing as human rip-offs. It all makes for a game that looks absolutely gorgeous. However, all isn't perfect in the universe. There were some unusual visual glitches involving ""camera angles."" Characters were looking in the wrong direction, people would disappear during dialog, and, in one instance, a character's head was turned nearly 180 degrees the wrong way. While not vital to the overall gameplay, those visual tics took me out of my immersion in the game and made for an unwelcome distraction. In addition, if you are playing the Xbox 360 version, the game allows you to use the Kinect device to issue commands to Shepard and squad members. You can voice direct weapon switches, abilities and actions. But ... if you don't want to use the Kinect, unplug it from your console. More than once, conversation in the room where I was playing had my characters doing things I wasn't expecting them to do. There are plenty of surprises throughout the game. The big one was the availability of a female Shepard, which was sought after by many fans of the franchise. But there are others. Major characters will die, entire species will be eliminated and every plot line that you can think of will get resolved. Romance options are back and causing a bit of controversy. Early critics of the game are lamenting the same-sex romance possibilities. But, hey ... with a universe as big as the Milky Way, anything can happen. And without giving any spoilers, the ending was a bit of a letdown for me, compared to all the excitement leading up to it. It left something of an unsatisfying aftertaste, but one that only ends up being a minor detraction from the entire adventure. ""Mass Effect 3"" does a great job of answering all the lingering questions in the ME universe and gives players the best chance to determine not just their own fate, but the fate of the galaxy. It is a fitting end to a wonderful trilogy that put the players in the driver's seat from the very beginning. ""Mass Effect 3"" will be available March 6 in North America, March 8 in Australia, March 9 in Europe and March 15 in Japan. It is playable on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Windows PC. It is rated M for Mature (17+) due to blood, partial nudity, sexual content, strong language, and violence. This review was done playing as a paragon infiltrator and as a renegade adept on a review copy for the Xbox 360.","Despite all the side missions and interactions, the main point remains taking back Earth .

"(CNN) -- Japan -- battered by a strong yen, slowing global demand and increased oil and gas imports due to last year's Fukushima nuclear disaster -- posted a record trade deficit of $18.7 billion in January, according to official figures released Monday. The record fall was stoked by greater energy imports of gas and oil following the March 11earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, which forced the closure of most of Japan's atomic power plants. ""The sharp increase of oil price could be the main reason of the sharp deterioration of trade balance,"" said Takahide Kiuchi, chief economist for Nomura Securities in Tokyo. Currently, only five reactors out of 54 in the country are in operation after officials allowed most to fall idle in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. By April, if more reactors are not brought online the country will have no nuclear plants in operation, placing more pressure on its energy suppliers. Liquid natural gas imports alone climbed 28.2% year on year, according to the ministry's preliminary report. Last month, U.N. nuclear experts gave a thumbs-up to Japan's planned ""stress tests"" for its remaining nuclear power plants to test whether they could withstand another emergency. The team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recommended Japanese regulators improve communication with the residents around the plants and address plans for dealing with severe accidents more comprehensively in the wake of the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. Monday's record deficit comes after Japan posted in 2011 its first annual trade deficit in 31 years, and underlines the difficulties facing the export-driven nation as it looks to rebuild. But the world's third largest economy faces difficult headwinds with a currency that reached record-high levels in the past year, cutting profits returning home from multinational companies and slowing demand from major trading partners such as the European Union and China. Exports fell 9.3% year-on-year, according to figures released by the country's Ministry of Finance Monday. The biggest drop was with China, which fell 20.1%. Exports to Europe fell 7.7%, while trade with the U.S. was up 0.6%. January was the fourth straight month where imports outpaced exports.

"(CNN) -- The suspected killers of Italian and British hostages who had been held in Nigeria have been arrested, an adviser to President Goodluck Jonathan said Thursday in a statement, according to the government-run Nigerian Television Authority. Reuben Abati, the president's special adviser on media and publicity, said the killers will face the full wrath of the law. The announcement came shortly after British Prime Minister David Cameron said the Briton and the Italian, who had been held hostage for 10 months in northern Nigeria, died Thursday in a failed rescue attempt. Their captors killed them ""before Navy Special Forces could get them,"" an unidentified official said. Nigerian security forces, with support from Britain, had launched an operation Thursday to free British citizen Chris McManus and Italian national Franco Lamolinara, Cameron said. ""It is with great regret that I have to say that both Chris and Franco have lost their lives,"" Cameron said in a statement. ""We are still awaiting confirmation of the details, but the early indications are clear that both men were murdered by their captors, before they could be rescued."" Cameron said British and Nigerian authorities had been working to free the hostages since they were kidnapped May 12, 2011. ""The terrorists holding the two hostages made very clear threats to take their lives, including in a video that was posted on the Internet,"" Cameron said. The prime minister said authorities couldn't locate the men for months, but eventually ""received credible information about their location"" and ""a window of opportunity arose to secure their release."" ""We also had reason to believe that their lives were under imminent and growing danger,"" Cameron said. ""Preparations were made to mount an operation to attempt to rescue Chris and Franco."" Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti said an ""unpredicted acceleration of events took place over the last hours."" Fearing imminent danger for the hostages, Nigerian authorities activated the rescue. He said Italian authorities were alerted once the operation began. Both leaders expressed their condolences to the families of the victims. Cameron thanked Nigerian authorities, Jonathan and British authorities for their efforts. The McManus family said in a statement that Chris ""was in an extremely dangerous situation. However we knew that everything that could be done was being done."" The family said they are ""devastated"" by the development and grieving over their loss. ""Our thoughts are also of course with the loved ones of Chris' colleague, Franco Lamolinara, who are also coming to terms with this truly sad news."" The men worked as engineers for an Italian construction company based in Nigeria, according to Agence France Presse. Gunmen stormed their apartment in Birnin Kebbi, the capital of Kebbi state in northwestern Nigeria, and kidnapped them, AFP said. Kebbi is on the border with Niger, where al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has claimed abductions of foreign workers. AFP received a video at its office in the Ivory Coast city of Abidjan last summer in which a speaker said that the two men had been abducted by al Qaeda. The hostages were ""blindfolded and on their knees, with three men holding weapons standing behind them, their faces hidden by turbans,"" AFP said. The agency reported that video ""was accompanied by photographs which showed the men without blindfolds."" It said that the hostages identified themselves and delivered statements ""urging their governments to meet the demands of the kidnappers, who they say are from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.""","Suspects have been arrested .

"(CNN) -- Walk into a room on the 17th floor of Copenhagen's Bella Sky Hotel and you'll be greeted by soft rose and burgundy toned colors, fresh flowers, fruit smoothies, fashion magazines, and a bathroom stocked with exclusive products, including day and night moisturizers. This might not sound all that appealing to Joe in accounting -- but that's okay because he'll never make it past the locked glass entrance to the floor. This is the Bella Donna -- Europe's first hotel floor dedicated entirely to women -- and according to the hotel's CEO Arne Bang Mikkelsen, it is designed by women, for women. See also: How to have more Sheryl Sandbergs . ""Men's and women's preferences are very different. When men come into a hotel room, the first thing they do is check the view, turn on the TV, plug in their computer, and check out the minibar. Women on the other hand go straight for the bathroom. Does it smell nice? Is it clean? Does it have a nice bathtub and shower?"" To get it right, the hotel asked a number of women what they wanted, and added to their list of priorities things like cleanliness, a nice bathroom, high-powered hairdryers, steam irons, cosmetic mirrors, healthy options on the room service menus, and full-body mirrors. Judy Brownell, professor and dean of students at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University, says the hotel is onto something. According to her research, women's hotel preferences are very different than men's with key priorities being to feel safe, comfortable, empowered, and valued. ""The problem is that in many cases, no action has been taken to meet women's needs,"" she says. See also: Women! Embrace your inner geek . Michelle Williams, event coordinator with Ernst & Young and guest at the Bella Donna floor agrees. ""Unlike other hotels, it seemed like someone actually thought about what women wanted. And there are so many women in my type of role traveling around the globe -- hotels need to wake up to that a bit."" It seems they are -- helped along by the boom in female business travelers. Global numbers are hard to come by but research cited in Brownell's Cornell University report shows women accounting for nearly half of all business travelers in the U.S. in 2010, up from approximately 25% in 1991 -- and less than 5% just 40 years ago. Places like the Naumi Hotel in Singapore, the Premier Hotel in New York, The London Dukes Hotel and the Georgian Court Hotel in Canadian Vancouver, seem to be realizing the potential in catering for women. See also: How girl geeks can get the best tech jobs . The Georgian Court Hotels says their Orchid Floor -- with its special offerings for women such as magazines, curling irons, nylon stockings, bath salts and yoga mats -- has been so successful they're considering adding a second floor. At the London Dukes Hotel, management says bookings to their ""Duchess Rooms"" -- which are standard rooms with fresh flowers, fruit, styling accessories, and other extras added -- have surged 25% over the past year. But not everyone thinks this will last -- or that it's a good idea. ""A lot of hotels will jump along on this fad -- and prove me wrong -- but I think it's a flash in the pan,"" says Marybeth Bond, National Geographic Author and founder of gutsytraveler.com. She sees it as little more then an advertising gimmick. ""I have seen the hotel industry cater subtly to women without being patronizing, for example by putting shower caps and nail files in the room, and adding a room service menu expanded beyond hamburger and fries to include a big salad. Why not have standard rooms and extras being offered at the front desk? We've lived through fighting for our equal rights and this is making us unequal."" Sanne Udsen, author and consultant on women's issues and careers, participated in the Bella Sky survey and sees no problem in targeting women as a segment. ""A lot of hotel services are geared towards men,"" she says. ""If you want to sell three-wheelers you target them at two-year-olds,"" she says. But Bond is not the only one who sees a problem. Denmark's gender equality board has ruled the women-only floor in Bella Sky Hotel discriminatory and illegal, following a complaint by a man. The hotel has been ordered to close the floor, but Mikkelsen refuses, saying he is prepared to take the case to court. ""It's no different then women having their own cycling club. Should I be allowed to be part of that?"" Discrimination and disagreements aside, the bottom line, says Judy Brownell, is that women will likely reward hotels that are ""listening"" to their preferences. ""This comment may stir controversy but that's okay. My personal guess, having focused on this subject for several years: Men see the beer and nuts and go, ""Wow, food! This is great!"" Women see the smoothies and fruit and go, ""I love this place -- they were thinking about my preferences."" But she adds, ""It's important for hoteliers to recognized that separate floors are just one way to address the situation.""","Copenhagen's Bella Sky Hotel was the first in Europe to dedicate a floor entirely to women .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Condescension is never appetizing. Not even when it's wrapped around a chimichanga. A political food fight broke out this week when Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank essentially wrote in a column that the Republican Party had nothing left to offer Latino voters other than the chimichanga. Let me set the table. Milbank was making a point that I've made dozens of times myself: Given the nation's demographics and the direction they're headed, the GOP is on a suicide mission if it continues to alienate Hispanics. One way that Senate Republicans were doing that, Milbank insisted, was by dragging their feet on President Barack Obama's nomination of Adalberto Jose Jordan to the 11th Circuit of Appeals. On Wednesday, the Senate finally confirmed him, in a 95-4 vote. Jordan will be the first Cuban-born judge to sit on that bench. But for a long time, Senate Republicans seemed intent on preventing that from occurring. They filibustered the nomination by doing what senators in both parties do during a filibuster: spouting nonsense for hours on end. Milbank seized on the nonsense that came from Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. The senator's remarks really had nothing to do with Latinos. They were about Arizona. ""The lettuce in your salad this month almost certainly came from Arizona,"" McCain said on the Senate floor. ""It's also believed that the chimichanga has its origin in Arizona."" Milbank sneered: ""The chimichanga? It may be the only thing Republicans have left to offer Latinos."" That told me that Milbank's knowledge of Latinos was a taco short of a combination plate. As dysfunctional as the modern-day Republican Party is with regard to immigration -- in large part, because it has basically volunteered to be the party of white Americans who are freaked out over shifting demographics -- the GOP offers Latinos quite a bit in other areas. For instance, a major reason you have even a sliver of accountability in America's public schools is because a Republican president -- George W. Bush -- pushed through the No Child Left Behind, the most important educational reform measure in 50 years. What does it tell you that the law is opposed by liberal teachers' unions but supported by the National Council of La Raza -- the nation's largest Latino advocacy group? What it tells me is that, when it comes to education reform and a host of other issues, the interests of the Democratic Party and its allies are not always in sync with the interests of the Latino community. Republicans also offer Latinos a full menu of conservative selling points: strong defense, smaller government, lower taxes, pro-life judges and a defense of traditional marriage. By the way, as someone who is pro-choice and supports gay marriage, those parts of the GOP message don't work on me. But the point is, they do work on Latinos who are more socially conservative. Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager, eagerly bit into Milbank's snarky quote, sending it out in a tweet. Of course he did. It's not like someone such as Messina has much else to do, with regard to Latino voters. The modern Democratic Party strategy for Hispanic outreach amounts to simply this: ""Hola! Vote for us. We're not Republicanos!"" I can't blame Messina for opportunistically seizing on a quote from someone else that he thinks will make his job easier. That is what political operatives do. But I do blame Milbank. His remark was uninformed and uncalled for. Latinos can trace their ancestry to a variety of different countries, and they're not interchangeable. Chimichangas might mean something to Mexicans or Mexican-Americans, but where does that leave Dominicans, Cubans, Brazilians, Puerto Ricans and others? Also, it's never a good idea for someone who isn't Latino to presume to know what appeals to Latinos. Lastly, if it's not too much to ask, just once I'd like to not be defined by a food group. That's what Hillary Clinton did when, during the 2008 presidential campaign, she told Hispanic voters gathered in a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas that the problems of all Americans are interconnected despite that ""we treat them as though one is guacamole and one is chips."" Politicians have dished out this tactic for years. In his congressional and Senate races, Lyndon Johnson went into the Hispanic enclaves of south Texas and handed out tacos and beer. Years later, President Gerald Ford tried to bond with a Hispanic audience by taking a bite out of a tamale. Bill Clinton loved Mexican food and consumed it with gusto. During a visit to a Mexican restaurant in Tucson in the late 1990s, Clinton showed his affinity with Hispanics by eating enough to satisfy an entire Mexican family. No political party is perfect. And neither Republicans nor Democrats are doing a very good job of serving Latinos at the moment. On the immigration issue, both have failed us. But the truth is that, despite what some liberals want Latinos to believe, the GOP offers a lot to that community. At moments like this, however, liberal Democrats offer only sarcasm, insults and condescension. It's enough to give you indigestion. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- ""Hacktivist"" collective Anonymous on Thursday took credit for taking down U.S. Department of Justice, FBI and entertainment company websites, following arrests in one of the federal government's largest anti-piracy crackdowns. Federal agents earlier in the day arrested the leaders of Megaupload.com and shut down the popular hub for illegal media downloads. Hours later, some of Megaupload's fans turned the table on the feds. Anonymous said it set its sights on the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI. Both sites appeared to be back up late Thursday, but portions of FBI.gov were not readily available. A law enforcement official told CNN the FBI was investigating. Anonymous said 10 websites in all were targeted. ""We Anonymous are launching our largest attack ever on government and music industry sites. Lulz,"" the group said in a statement posted late Thursday on an associated Twitter account. ""The FBI didn't think they would get away with this did they? They should have expected us."" The group also posted personal information on former Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, one of the targeted sites. A Justice Department spokesperson, who did not want to be identified, said its Web server was ""experiencing a significant increase in activity, resulting in a degradation in service."" ""The department is working to ensure the website is available while we investigate the origins of this activity, which is being treated as a malicious act until we can fully identify the root cause of the disruption,"" the spokesperson said. The website glitches came soon after various Twitter accounts associated with the collective took aim at the government. Anonymous' favorite weapon for these attacks is what's called a ""distributed denial of service"" (DDoS) attack, which directs a flood of traffic to a website and temporarily crashes it by overwhelming its servers. It doesn't actually involve any hacking or security breaches. ""One thing is certain: EXPECT US! #Megaupload"" read one tweet from AnonOps that went out midafternoon. One hour later, the same account tweeted a victory message: ""Tango down! http://universalmusic.com & http://www.justice.gov// #Megaupload"" Speaking of the Web attacks, an Anonymous representative said 5,635 people used a networking tool called a ""low orbit ion cannon."" A LOIC is a software tool that aims a massive flood of traffic at a targeted site. The news comes as lawmakers have turned their attention to anti-piracy legislation. Protests erupted both online and offline this week against two bills under consideration in Congress: the House's Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Senate's Protect IP Act (PIPA). The bills are aimed at cracking down on copyright infringement by restricting access to sites that host or facilitate the trading of pirated content. But the legislation has created a divide between tech giants, who say the language is too broad, and large media companies, who say they are losing millions each year to rampant online piracy. (Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, is among the industry supporters of the legislation.) On Twitter, YourAnonNews said Thursday's attacks meant an ""involuntary blackout"" for sites of SOPA supporters. Universal Music's website went down Thursday afternoon. The music company had been locked in a legal battle with Megaupload over a YouTube video that featured many of Universal Music's signed artists promoting Megaupload's site. The websites of the Recording Industry Association of America and Motion Picture Association of America were out of action Thursday afternoon, but they appeared to be back up later in the evening. A spokesman for RIAA cast the attack as a minor hiccup. ""The fact that a couple of sites might have been taken down is really ancillary to the significant news today that the Justice Department brought down one of the world's most notorious file-sharing hubs,"" he said. The Anonymous attack came soon after the Justice Department announced the indictment of seven individuals connected to Megaupload for allegedly operating an ""international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works."" Authorities said the operation had generated more than $175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships. According to the indictment, Megaupload, which launched in 2005, was once the 13th-most visited website on the Internet, serving as a hub for distribution of copyrighted television shows, images, computer software and video games. The site's popular MegaVideo subsidiary was widely known in tech circles for its copious selection of pirated content, including recent movies and episodes of hit TV shows. Four of those indicted were arrested Thursday in Auckland, New Zealand, at the request of the United States. Three others remain at large. The individuals indicted are citizens of New Zealand, Germany, Slovakia and the Netherlands. No U.S. citizens were named. However, Megaupload has servers in Ashburn, Virginia, and Washington, which prompted the Virginia-based investigation. To shut down Megaupload, federal authorities executed 20 search warrants in eight countries, seizing 18 domain names and $50 million worth of assets, including servers in Virginia, Washington, the Netherlands and Canada. In some of its attacks, Anonymous has targeted governments or companies it says are part of or support a police state. The list of police officers and agencies targeted by the collective is long. From New York to Oakland, California, police websites have been hacked; personal information, including the home addresses of specific police officers, was posted online in 2011.

"(CNN) -- Police on Friday identified the gunman who walked into a Pittsburgh psychiatric hospital and started shooting as 30-year-old John Shick. Pittsburgh police Cmdr. Thomas Stangrecki initially told reporters that attempts to name the man, who was not carrying identification, had failed. But later Friday said authorities had determined his identity and were reviewing his personal computer as part of their investigation. Shick was shot and killed by police Thursday, but not before he killed hospital employee Michael Schaab, 25, and injured seven others. ""It was clear that Michael was truly a leader among our staff, and he was beloved by the geriatric patients whom he cared for every day,"" said hospital President Claudia Roth. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this time."" Roth called the incident a ""senseless act of violence"" that ""has had a profound impact on all of us who knew and admired him."" ""He will be greatly missed,"" she said. A law enforcement source told CNN's Susan Candiotti that Shick is believed to be a transient from the western United States. Shick's Pittsburgh apartment was being searched Friday evening. One of the two 9mm handguns recovered was traced to New Mexico and the other was traced to Texas, the law enforcement source said. It was not known whether the weapons were legally purchased or how Shick allegedly came to have them. Investigators also recovered an extra box of ammunition, the source said. The guns generally hold about 15 rounds. It remained unclear how many rounds were fired before the suspect was killed by police. Four people remained hospitalized Friday, according to hospital spokeswoman Wendy Zellner. They include a 46-year-old man listed in fair condition, a 64-year-old woman in serious condition, a 35-year-old man in good condition and a 49-year-old man in serious condition, authorities said. A 54-year-old woman was released from the hospital Friday. ""This is a tragic day, a sad day, a senseless day,"" Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said after the shooting Thursday at the medical center. The assailant walked through the psychiatric hospital's front door with a pair of semi-automatic handguns around 1:40 p.m., according to Ravenstahl. Officers from the University of Pittsburgh Police Department arrived within ""a matter of minutes"" and ""engaged"" the gunman, the mayor added. ""There is no doubt that their swift response saved lives today,"" said Ravenstahl, lauding the police officers' ""courage and willingness to step up."" Those wounded were swiftly ushered to nearby UPMC Presbyterian. All are expected to survive. Officials said two of the five hospitalized patients have undergone surgery. iReporter was on the scene . Ravenstahl said that a University of Pittsburgh police officer ""was grazed with a bullet, and I believe he is doing well."" Steven Bartholomew, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said his agency is ""working with Pittsburgh police and other authorities in the investigation."" ""Any firearms recovered will be traced to determine their source,"" Bartholomew said. At one point Thursday, the University of Pittsburgh's official Twitter account had a message that suggested a ""possible 2nd actor"" was involved and called for a lockdown. But later Thursday, the medical center's Twitter feed had a message that ""there was no second shooter"" and there was ""no hostage situation,"" as had been reported elsewhere. Roth, the psychiatric hospital's president, said after the shooting that treatment at the facility ""will be uncompromised,"" with care continuing to be delivered through the day and night ""the same way we always have."" CNN's Jeremy Ryan contributed to this report.","NEW: Officials search suspect's apartment, source says .

"(CNN) -- Convertibles are selling well at the Mercedes Benz dealership in Sendai in North Japan. This seems odd, because Sendai is hardly the kind of place you imagine driving around with the top down. The temperature is in single-digits for five months of the year and it's even colder if you drive towards coast. Yet Tsutomu Ishihara, the president of Mercedes dealership Yanase Tohoku, says he sold 16 cars in August and September. In fact, most of his models are selling well, with business up 50% over a year ago. He's hardly alone. In the aftermath the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, business across Sendai is experiencing a reconstruction bounce. Thanks to an influx of construction workers, evacuees and government compensation money, Sendai has become the hub of Japan's recovery economy, the outlier in the midst of struggling coastal towns that are just beginning to rebuild. Beyond the influx of reconstruction funds, the disaster has helped open the purse strings of people in the afflicted areas. In the face of such much death, why save? ""The consumers' mindset has changed after the quake,"" Ishihara said. ""People used to try not to spend so much and save money, but after the quake, (they) spend more on luxurious cars, also because the stock market and exchange market are not doing well now."" Sendai is an exception. Japan saw its current account-- the sum of inbound versus outbound trade -- hit a record $5.4 billion deficit last month, according to government figures released Thursday. For Japan's export-driven economy, it's a change of fortune that underlines the economic troubles of the past year. Analysts say much of Japan's trade deficit comes from increased importation and prices for natural gas and oil, which has increased in use since much of the nation's nuclear power supply has been taken offline. Getting the auto industry back on the road . ""One year on from the earthquake, Japan's economy remains deeply affected by the disaster,"" Takehide Kiuchi, chief economist of Nomura Securities, wrote in a recent research report. Views of the potential economic impact at the time of the disaster ""ranged from extremely optimistic to extremely pessimistic,"" Kiuchi wrote, but both now seem wide of the mark. Darker expectations foresaw widespread civil unrest, wholesale layoffs among Japanese companies and a slump in consumer spending -- none of which came to pass. On the other hand, hopes that reconstruction would alleviate the twin forces that have been hurting the economy -- the rising value of the yen and persistent deflation -- did not occur, either, Kiuchi notes. ""Looking back at the progress made with reconstruction over this last year, we get a clear sense of the strength of Japan's private sector,"" Kiuchi said. ""Japanese companies have shown amazing speed in addressing the supply chain problems that have arisen, particularly in the auto part sector, and these issues have been brought to a swift resolution."" The government response, however, is another story. ""In contrast to the great efforts made by the private sector, the response of the authorities has left much unresolved,"" Kiuchi said. ""In the aftermath of the earthquake, the ruling and opposition parties were expected to form a government of national unity, but this never came to fruition."" Japanese PM says 'many lessons learned' One of Japan's wealthiest men and the founder of retailer Uniqlo, Tadashi Yanai, feels the events of March 11 served as a wakeup call to the Japanese about the precarious state of the economy. ""We spend double of what we make. Our administrative structure is the most inefficient in the world. This cannot continue,"" he said. He hopes the rebuilding will not be a return to the old ways, but an opportunity to reform the government and make Japan's economy more integrated with the outside world. Still, in Sendai, business is booming. Builder Noburu Sato describes the non-stop calls from people who need to rebuild their homes. ""Honestly speaking, I developed a heart problem in the beginning, because I got so many calls,"" he says. ""My phone didn't stop ringing."" Before the earthquake, many of his competitors had left the construction industry. Now, the only limiting factor is workers, who are coming from as far as Kobe or Nigata in pursuit of work. Builders say there is enough work to last them ten years. One man's battle to revive the fishing industry . The recovery workers, from laborers to construction executives, are also spending, bringing business for Sendai's hotels, bars and restaurants. The manager of a capsule hotel in downtown Sendai says his business is twice what it was a year ago, with no shortage of men willing to pay around $45 to use the baths and occupy a tiny room for the night. Many say there is also a change in attitude towards spending, with locals flocking to luxury stores in a way they didn't see before the quake. Sales at large retail stores were up 10% last quarter. ""We used to think, 'let's wait' even though we wanted to buy,"" says one shopper, carrying a bag from Louis Vuitton. ""But after such experience we learned that such an idea was no use.""","City of Sendai is center of Japan's recovery economy .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spanish police arrested 12 people Thursday on suspicion of Islamic terrorist activities, authorities said. Firefighters extricating bodies from one of the trains that exploded near Atocha station, Madrid, in 2004. Eight of them, all Moroccans, were arrested early Thursday. They are suspected of providing cover for five fugitives from the Madrid train bombings four years ago and also of involvement in financing and recruiting of Islamic terrorists, according to the ministry statement and a judicial source. Later Thursday, police arrested four more people -- three Moroccans and an Algerian -- in their prison cells for similar charges. Additional details about those four were not immediately released. The operation was conducted on orders of Judge Baltasar Garzon, an investigating magistrate at Spain's National Court, which handles cases of terrorism. The suspects range in age from 23 to 56. Four are from Tangiers, just across the Mediterranean from mainland Spain, and the others from elsewhere in Morocco, the ministry said. The Madrid train bombing took place on March 11, 2004, killed 191 people and wounded 1,800. In the days and months that followed, police arrested a number of suspects in and around Madrid, but determined that a small number of suspects had escaped. Authorities have long suspected that they had help getting out of the area with the assistance of a secretive group of accomplices. The main Madrid train bombing trail ended in 2007 with the convictions of 23 men. Five of them were later acquitted by the Supreme Court. A small number of other suspects have yet to stand trial. Since the bombings, Spanish police have arrested dozens of Islamic terror suspects, who are accused of activities ranging from plotting attacks to providing financing to recruitment.","Those held suspected of providing cover for fugitives from Madrid train bombings .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama, a well-known basketball fan, will treat British Prime Minister David Cameron to a little March Madness Tuesday as the two head to Ohio to catch an NCAA men's tournament basketball game. There will be two games tipping off the tournament in Dayton, Ohio, a swing state. During halftime of the first game, Western Kentucky versus Mississippi Valley State, the two leaders will conduct a joint interview. The leaders' trip to the game comes as Obama launched his new tournament ""bracket challenge"" on his campaign website. Obama is asking those who visit the website to predict who will win the college basketball championship and to compare their picks against his. ""It's college basketball time again â€” and as friends and co-workers gather around the water cooler to talk top seeds and Cinderellas, here's your chance to fill out a bracket with the President himself,"" the website says. The site promises to publish the names of anyone who does better than the president once the tournament is over. Obama has publicly picked brackets in years past, drawing heat from Republicans last year for appearing in an ESPN segment to unveil his picks in March 2011. RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said the White House should ""explain why filming an ESPN special on the NCAA tournament should be a priority on his public schedule."" Before revealing the picks, the president did urge viewers to go to usaid.gov to donate to charities that were assisting in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami that had devastated Japan that month. For the record, Obama picked Kansas, Duke, Ohio State, Pitt for his 2011 final four and chose Kansas to take the championship. It didn't. UConn won, beating Butler. It is unclear if Obama would reveal this year's picks during his interview with Cameron on Tuesday. But Cameron's visit will not be all fun and games. On Wednesday, the two leaders will be back in Washington conducting extensive meetings about a range of topics including Afghanistan and Syria, the White House said. ""There's a strong working relationship and actually even a strong personal bond between Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama,"" White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest said last week. ""We maintain a special and a essential friendship and partnership with the government and people of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is our NATO ally and our closest partner in the world."" On Tuesday, the two co-authored an op-ed piece in the Washington Post titled "" An alliance the world can count on."" ""The alliance between the United States and Great Britain is a partnership of the heart, bound by the history, traditions and values we share. But what makes our relationship special â€” a unique and essential asset â€” is that we join hands across so many endeavors. Put simply, we count on each other and the world counts on our alliance,"" the leaders said in the article.","There will be two games played in Ohio on Tuesday, tipping off the NCAA tournament .

Well, those days are over. Now you have myriad channels by which to potentially embarrass yourself while under the influence. And if you're among the 28 percent of the population with smartphones, this is true even if you're out and about and not pathetically staring at your screen at 3 a.m., alone save for your good friends Bud(weiser) and Johnny (Walker). While we can't help you cease replacing the emptiness in your soul with shiftless parties in communal living/performance spaces replete with the nectar of glowsticks and Four Loko, we can help you undo -- or prevent -- some of the damage you will inevitably inflict whilst doing so. Read on for four ways you can turn back the clock on your Internet indiscretions. You don't have to be a rampant partier to benefit from these tools and tips. Even the most stoic among us have moments of insanity in which we fire off missives into the internet ether we wish we could reverse. Let's play telephone roulette . Let's start with the most old-school of communication devices -- the phone -- and a simple exercise: 1). Take out your phone, 2). Close your eyes, 3). Scroll through your contacts 4). Open your eyes, 5). Dial. If you're now thinking to yourself, ""Oh, no! Don't call THAT PERSON!"" it's time to clean out your phone. Let's face it, when it comes to our address books, we're all woeful hoarders -- you know, those people who live in castles fashioned from piles of newspapers, around which prance a parade of feral cats? That's us. From Thai delivery services located in cities we no longer inhabit to exes we no longer remember (""Who the hell is 'Ricardo Lardo'? I feel like it might be a pejorative nickname designed to dissuade me from contacting him..."") to old bosses, for some reason, we cling to these old digits like ratty blankies, clutched in our no-longer-childlike hands.

You'll thank us when you're fumbling with your cell at 2:33 a.m. desperately trying to call a car service, and your old boss Caren (who fired you two years ago after you cussed her out and threw her impressive collection of desk toys against the wall in a fit of rage) gets a surprise ring-a-ling. Hit ""undo"" on an email gone awry . You've just shared a bottle of wine -- or four -- with a couple of friends, over which you discussed everyone's various and sundry romantic woes. Stumbling a bit, you pour yourself (and about a gallon of pinot) into a cab, where the cabbie -- who is an aspiring novelist, in the style of the ever-venerable Bukowski -- tells you that you'll never fall in love in this city. It's a dark time, and the hearts of young folks are even darker. Feeling a bit more black and blue than usual, you go to your computer, thoughts of your not-quite-platonic best friend tumbling through your mind. You open an email from said friend, containing a link to a hilarious video featuring a bomb squad discovering a box of kittens (ha!), and shoot off a reply, ""I love you. No. Seriously."" Suddenly, you sober up -- what with all the expletives that are spewing from your mouth and the sweating -- and stare at the computer in horror. Well, luckily for you, Google -- in typical Big Brother fashion -- knew that you would do that, and has a quick fix: The Undo Button. In the past, the lesser-known Gmail feature only gave you 5 seconds to un-email, but a few months ago, the service extended that limit to 30 seconds. To unlock this ability, merely click the little green icon on the top right of your inbox, which will take you to Google Labs. Find ""Enable Undo Send,"" do so, and choose the 30-second option.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- The death toll has risen to six following an attack on a Kenyan bus station that left dozens wounded, the Red Cross said Sunday. At least 68 people are undergoing treatment at a Nairobi hospital, according to the agency. The explosions, which authorities believe are grenade attacks, occurred Saturday at a normally-crowded bus station in central Nairobi. ""We still need to complete investigations and we cannot immediately confirm who did this, but we highly suspect that it is Al-Shabaab or sympathizers of Al-Shabaab,"" said Charles Owino, the police deputy spokesman. ""Eyewitnesses say that grenades were thrown from a vehicle and the suspected perpetrators fled from the scene."" There have been several instances of grenade attacks at bus stations and at a bar in Nairobi in recent months. One person was killed and 20 injured in October when an attacker hurled grenades into a bar and a bus station. In that attack, a Kenyan man pleaded guilty to being a member of the Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab and was charged with causing grievous bodily harm. The East African nation has been on edge since it sent its troops into Somalia to pursue Al-Shabaab militants after the abductions of tourists and aid workers in Kenya. It blames the abductions on Al-Shabaab, which has denied involvement.

"(CNN) -- Murder charges against two Maryland doctors over abortions they performed on late-term fetuses have been dropped, prosecutors said Wednesday. ""We have exercised our discretion to dismiss them at this point,"" said Cecil County State's Attorney Ellis Rollins. The doctors, Steven Brigham and Nicola Riley, had faced identical charges: five counts each of first-degree murder, five of second-degree murder and one of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. The investigation began August 13, 2010, when Riley brought a woman into an Elkton hospital due to a ""complication resulting from a medical procedure,"" police said. The woman had driven from New Jersey to Maryland for an abortion, investigators later determined. Days later, Elkton police searched the abortion clinic where Brigham and Riley work and found several fetuses ""in a freezer chest."" The fetuses were taken to a medical examiner's office in Baltimore, according a police news release. Maryland is one of 38 states that have fetal homicide laws, often supported by anti-abortion advocates, which advocates say are intended to protect the lives of both the pregnant woman and the fetus.","Murder charges are dropped against two doctors over late-term abortions they performed .

"Jacmel, Haiti (CNN) -- Tuesday morning, Joachin ""Clark"" Jean-Gilles was a millionaire. Tuesday night, he was sleeping in his car. Jean-Gilles was owner of the Peace of Mind Hotel in Jacmel, Haiti, a three-story, 30-room hideaway in a quiet tropical valley on Haiti's southern coast, 25 miles from the bustle of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Jean-Gilles and his wife, Marie, lived in an apartment on the property, close enough to watch carefully over the guest rooms, conference rooms, boutique and restaurant, close enough that they pledged to know the first name of every guest. After the 7.0-earthquake hit, they slept in their aging Isuzu, parked in the hotel driveway. Jean-Gilles figured a split second was the difference between life and death when the temblor struck. He was working in a ground-floor conference room and first heard, then felt the quake. He asked his electrician, Roberne St. Louis, who was working nearby, what was happening. ""Get out. Now. Get out. Now,"" St. Louis said. Jean-Gilles cleared the collapsing structure by a mere second, he estimated. His wife, who was working in the couple's apartment on the second floor, wasn't able to get clear. People nearby heard her screams after the shaking stopped and removed the cinder blocks entrapping her by hand. She was shaken and scratched, but walked away from the wreckage. ""I am alive. God is good,"" she repeated over and over on Saturday. Are you in Haiti and safe? Share your photos with CNN . The Peace of Mind Hotel was a dream come true for Jean-Gilles, 57, and Marie, 59. Born in Port-au-Prince, they moved to the United States shortly after meeting 34 years ago. Together, they owned a beauty supply store in Jersey City, New Jersey, and invested in real estate. In 2003, they cashed out their U.S. investments, returned to Haiti and began building the Peace of Mind Hotel, looking to make a future for themselves and the people of their homeland. ""In a country that is so poor, we knew we could do well. We could help people by creating jobs,"" Jean-Gilles said. They did just that. The Peace of Mind, which they valued at about $2 million, was theirs free and clear. They employed 40 people during the construction and had 25 on staff when the quake struck. One employee, who is also a relative, was killed in the collapse. Her body was retrieved on Saturday. One other body remained in the rubble of the Peace of Mind, that of an American working in Haiti who'd stopped in for a few drinks and to use the Internet. Heavy machinery pulled away chunks of debris and the smell said searchers were close to finding that body, too. The couple's relatives in the United States didn't learn of their survival until this story was published on CNN.com. A relative saw the couple's picture on CNN.com's homepage and told others, said the couple's daughter-in-law, Karen Jean-Gilles of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. She said she and other relatives were going crazy with worry until they saw the picture. The relatives in the United States still haven't been able to reach the couple, but Karen Jean-Gilles' husband plans to go to Haiti and find them as soon as commercial flights resume, she said. ""I was crying. I was just so happy that they are OK,"" Karen Jean-Gilles said Sunday evening. "" As for the hotel, while business wasn't overwhelming during its first year, hope was high for February, when the annual carnival celebration brings thousands of people to Jacmel. Business in Haiti relies a lot on hope. There is no insurance for small-business men like himself, Jean-Gilles said. And he'd yet to find international insurance since he opened the hotel last February. He'd worked six years on it and invested a lifetime of savings. Saturday, Jean-Gilles said he wanted to rebuild, but was at a loss on how he could make that happen. ""We don't have a source of revenue. This hotel was the source of our revenue. All we've worked for our whole life. And it's gone,"" he said. Still, he tossed around options. An outbuilding that served as a kitchen survived. Maybe he could build around that.

"(CNN) -- Today, we live in a world of breathtaking possibilities. We can send instant messages to our loved ones on the other side of the world at the tap of a finger. We can share vacation photos with friends in real time. We can entrust our private data to a cloud service provider without having to worry about storage space. All this technological advancement helps drive innovation, growth and job creation. In Europe, we are embracing these changes. But alongside progress, we are faced with new regulatory challenges. In a recent poll, 72% of Europeans said they are concerned about how companies use their personal data. Worries about online privacy are one of the most frequent reasons for why people don't buy goods and services on the Web. Our confidence in a digital future will depend on whether we know that our data will be safely protected. Consumers are not the only ones concerned; businesses are, too. Companies have to navigate 27 sometimes contradictory data protection rules across the 27 European Union countries. The current rules are antiquated; they were drawn up in 1995 and predate the widespread use of the Internet. That is why, last month, I proposed reforming the data protection rules. Our goal is to make the common market for European goods and services more accessible to businesses and consumers, boost our economy and set an international standard for online privacy. In Europe, the protection of personal data is a fundamental right. This right is clearly stated in the European Union Treaty and legislation. To make this right effective, people need to be in control of their own data. So, what will the new rules do? First of all, people need to be informed about how their data will be used in clear and simple language: what data are collected, for what purposes and for how long they will be stored. People need to be able to make an informed decision about what to disclose, when and to whom. Second, people have to give explicit consent before their personal data -- contact lists, photos or e-mails -- are used. Companies cannot use it for purposes other than what was agreed upon. Third, people will have better control over their own data. They need to be able to access their own data, to easily take them to another provider or have them deleted if they no longer want them to be used. This is what I call the right to be forgotten. We want to clarify that people shall have the right -- and not only the ""possibility"" -- to withdraw their consent. Finally, individuals must be swiftly informed when their personal data are lost, stolen or hacked. Online security breaches affect millions of people around the world. Companies must inform the data protection authorities and the people affected right away, preferably within 24 hours. But the new European Union rules are not only about helping consumers. They will also help businesses in three key ways. First, they create legal certainty by replacing the current patchwork of laws in Europe with a single set of rules for all 27 European Union countries. Second, the regulatory environment will be simplified by cutting out red tape when we introduce a one-stop shop for businesses to deal with regulators. In the future, companies will have to deal only with the data protection authorities in the European Union country in which they are based. This will reduce administrative burdens and will save businesses about â‚¬2.3 billion a year. Finally, the new rules will provide clarity for international data transfers. Personal data can be collected in Berlin and processed in Bangalore. We should improve the current system of binding corporate rules to make these types of exchanges less burdensome and more secure. The end result is that companies will be able to sell goods and services under the same data protection rules to the entire European Union, a market of 500 million people. What a great business opportunity. These new rules are designed to stand the test of time. They will give people control of their own personal data while making life easier for companies as well. Online privacy and personal data protection is a global challenge. As Europe tackles reform, I hope these proposed rules will inspire other countries that are grappling with privacy issues, like the United States. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- This is the time of the year when everyone can channel their inner Dick Vitale. Just make sure not to startle your co-workers if you start yelling, ""Awesome, baby!"" Everyone in the entire country, starting on Selection Sunday when the NCAA Tournament brackets are revealed, becomes a college basketball expert. From President Obama to that annoying woman in accounting who lets her corgie make the picks (and still somehow wins the office pool), we're all about to pretend we know more about Cinderella than the prince himself. So if you're just now beginning to pay attention, here is an A-to-Z primer of what you're going to find in your brackets. A is for Antonio, which is the real first name for dynamic Syracuse guard Scoop Jardine. He averages 4.9 assists for the Orange, which went 30-1 in the regular season to become one of the favorites this month. B is for Bourbon Street, which is where a few thousand fans will converge during the Final Four (the games are March 31 and April 2). This is the fifth time New Orleans has hosted the event, and if you believe geography has anything to do with a team's success, you might pick North Carolina (the winners there in 1982 and 1993), Indiana (1987) or Syracuse (2003). C is for Connecticut, the defending national champions who have had anything but a smooth season wearing the crown. The Huskies underachieved to start the season, then watched their iconic head coach, Jim Calhoun, sidelined with back problems. But now Calhoun is back, and there's no doubting his team has talent. ""It's been a different kind of season,"" he said at the Big East Tournament. ""But through it all, somewhat by separation, I realized how much I care about these kids."" D is for Draymond, and if you like watching college basketball to see a player develop, you like Draymond Green. The forward averaged just 3.3 points and 3.3 rebounds as a freshman at Michigan State, but four years later, he was named Big Ten Player of the Year in leading the Spartans to a share of the league title. E is for emergency room, which is where Seton Hall center Herb Pope was rushed on April 28, 2010, after his heart stopped. His condition was so serious the school prepared a press release to announce his death, but two years later with Pope as the key player up front, the Pirates are potentially one of 10 Big East teams that could make the tournament field. F is for Frank Haith, the head coach at Missouri. You want a successful first season on the job? Try Haith leading the Tigers to a 27-4 record in the regular season. But now comes the real goal: Getting Missouri, which will be making its 25th NCAA Tournament appearance, into its first Final Four. SI.com: See where your team stands for March Madness . G is for Gaels, the nickname for West Coast Conference champion St. Mary's. If you're from Down Under (or just enjoy Foster's beer), you'll like the Gaels: They've built their program on a pipeline from Australia that now includes conference player of the year Matthew Dellavedova. As fans chant during their games, ""Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! Oi! Oi! Oi!"" H is for Harvard, which is getting as much attention for its basketball team these days as its business school. Not only are the Crimson back in the tournament for the first time since the Truman administration (that's 1946), but their former star Jeremy Lin has quickly become a worldwide superstar for his surprising play for the Knicks. I is for Indiana, back in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2008. If that doesn't seem like a long drought, consider: The Hoosiers were a tournament fixture every year from 1986 to 2003 and have won five titles (1940, 1953, 1976, 1981 and 1987). J is for Jackrabbits, the unique mascot for first-time tournament participant South Dakota State. The origin is believed to be an early 1900s newspaper article that described the team ""as quick as jackrabbits."" And they better be, since they're likely headed to a first-round matchup with one of the top programs in the country. K is for Krzyzewski -- or, if you prefer, Coach K. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski has won this tournament four times, more than any coach in the tournament (just one man in the history of college basketball, John Wooden with 10, has more). Do the Blue Devils have what it takes to deliver No. 5? They'll have to count on emerging freshman star Austin Rivers if they do. L is for Loyola (Maryland), where the colorful Jimmy Patsos is the head coach. When Patsos was a graduate assistant at Maryland, he worked a side job as a bartender in the Georgetown section of D.C. -- and his reputation for courtside theatrics means the TV cameras will spend plenty of time watching him during the Greyhounds' first-round game. M is for Murray State, which is the best team most casual college fans have never heard of. Only a four-point loss to Tennessee State kept the Racers from rural Murray, Kentucky, from entering the tournament at a perfect 31-0, and with junior guard Isaiah Canaan (19.2 points per game), there's no telling how far they'll go this month. N is for Northwestern, and that'll be one of the biggest questions heading into Selection Sunday: Will the Wildcats finally earn their first ever berth in the NCAA Tournament? ""The stats are out there,"" is all head coach Bill Carmody would say when asked if his team belonged this week, so don't expect much lobbying from Chicago. O is for office pools, on which the FBI estimates more than $2.5 billion is gambled each year. That's a lot of people who think they know which No. 12 seed is going to advance to the Sweet 16. Take the CNN bracket challenge . P is for proud papa, which is how Detroit Mercy coach Ray McCallum is feeling this week. Not only are his Titans back in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1999, but they're in the field because his son, Ray Jr., carried them there. Ray Jr., who scored 21 points in the Horizon League championship game, could have played on a bigger stage but decided to stick with dad. ""This is the greatest feeling in world!"" he said. Q is for Quinnipiac, which did not make the tournament. But doing an A to Z would be much easier if it finally did. R is for regionals, or the round of the tournament that determines which teams reach the Final Four. If you live in Boston, Phoenix, St. Louis or Atlanta, you might notice some folks wearing their team colors and milling around downtown bars and restaurants in a few weeks. S is for Shockers, the nickname for Wichita State. Looking for the next George Mason, that unexpected team to make a run to the Final Four? The Shockers are deep and talented enough, with point guard Joe Ragland and 7-foot center Garrett Stutz, that it wouldn't be, uh, shocking if they went on a run. T is for Tinkle, as in Montana coach Wayne Tinkle, who has the Grizzlies back in the tournament with their best record in 20 years. Can they pull off a first-round upset? ""We have achieved our No. 1 goal now and that was winning the tournament championship to go to the NCAAs,"" Tinkle said. ""We are not out of our goals yet."" U is for UCLA, and don't bother looking for them in your brackets. The team with more NCAA Tournament victories than any other is not in the field. Neither is Butler, the surprising team from Indianapolis that reached back-to-back national championship games. V is for VCU, back in the tournament field after pulling off perhaps the most unlikely Final Four run in history last season. The Rams went all the way from the ""First Four"" -- the matchups played in Dayton, Ohio, on the Tuesday before the full tournament gets under way -- to the Final Four under head coach Shaka Smart. Can they do it again? It's unlikely, of course, but the Rams are one of the hottest teams in the nation, winning 17 of their last 18 games. W is for Western Kentucky, which started the season at 5-14 but managed to win the Sun Belt Tournament to lock up its automatic bid. Do the 15-18 Hilltoppers belong in the field? As long as that means their cuddly amorphous mascot Big Red gets a chance to dance in the Dance, who cares? X is for Xavier, which has reached 10 of the last 11 tournaments but is sitting squarely on the tournament bubble this year. Will the Musketeers and senior guard Tu Holloway make it? It'll be one of the biggest questions when the field is revealed. Y is for youth, and Kentucky is among the favorites to win the national title because of it. Two freshmen have led the way for the Wildcats -- Anthony Davis, the 6-10 shot-blocking specialist from Chicago, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, the intense forward from New Jersey. Enjoy them while you can: Both are likely NBA lottery picks if they enter the draft at the end of the season. Z is for Zeller, as in Tyler Zeller, the ACC Player of Year at North Carolina. The Tar Heels are arguably the most talented team in the country, but do they have what it takes to win six games in the tournament? Of course, if anyone could answer that question, it wouldn't be March Madness.","NCAA Tournament brackets revealed on Selection Sunday, March 11 .

"(CNN) -- Mississippi's Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the controversial pardons of more than 200 convicts that former Gov. Haley Barbour granted on his way out of office, rejecting a challenge by the state's attorney general. In a 77-page, 6-3 ruling Thursday afternoon, the court found the pardons ""may not be set aside or voided by the judicial branch."" Attorney General Jim Hood had argued that no proper notice had been posted in newspapers, but the court found the final decision rested ""solely with the governor."" ""We are mindful that the victims and their families are entitled to be interested in the subject matter of this case, and they are undoubtedly -- and understandably -- concerned with its outcome,"" Justice Jess Dickinson wrote for the majority. But in the cases before them, ""It fell to the governor alone to decide whether the Constitution's publication requirement was met."" Randy Walker, who survived a shooting by one of the men who was freed, told CNN sister network HLN that he was ""totally in shock."" ""I thought it was pretty clear-cut that the constitution pretty clearly says one thing, and the justices went another way, as did Barbour,"" Walker said. In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, Barbour said the court ""reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state,"" but acknowledged that his decision ""has been difficult"" for many of the inmates' victims. But in a dissenting opinion, Justice Michael Randolph called the decision ""a stunning victory for some lawless convicted felons, and an immeasurable loss for the law-abiding citizens of our state."" Hood argued that the state Constitution required that for a pardon to be valid, notices be filed, each day, for 30 days in newspapers where their crimes were committed. But during a February Supreme Court hearing, Barbour's lawyers argued that previous state court rulings had found the 30-day notice rule was ""an unconstitutional encroachment"" on the governor's power. Thursday's ruling is the final word on the case, but Hood said he would seek to get the notice requirement restored to the state charter. ""We do respect the decision of the Court, but feel deeply for how it must weigh on the victims and their families. It is these victims and family members who have lost today and the criminals who have won,"" he said in a written statement, echoing Randolph's dissent. Among the 214 inmates Barbour pardoned before he left office in January were four convicted murderers who had worked as ""trusties"" at the governor's mansion. Critics argued that the governor failed to consider the families of their victims before freeing them. All four and an armed robber also pardoned by Barbour have remained free while the issue worked their way through the courts, with their whereabouts monitored daily since January. They are now free under Thursday's decision, and five other inmates who had remained behind bars awaiting a ruling will be released soon. Ed Blackmon, a lawyer who represented two of those still held, said he expected his clients would be released by Friday. ""Family members are very anxious to have them released,"" he said. One of the men, Azikiwe Kambule, is a South African national, and plans to return home upon his release. ""I would encourage him to leave immediately,"" Blackmon said. The remainder of those pardoned had already served their time. One of the pardoned trusties was David Gatlin, who had been serving a life sentence for killing his estranged wife Tammy while she held their 6-week-old baby. Walker was wounded in the same attack. Tammy Gatlin's sister, Tiffany Brewer, called Thursday's ruling ""so unfair."" ""I feel like my sister was let down. I think Barbour just wanted to show he had the power to do this. He didn't care about my family or any of the other families. He wanted everyone to know he was the big man, and he proved it,"" Brewer said. Barbour has defended his pardons and said the former inmates had been rehabilitated. He said the case was not only about the power of the governor's office, ""but about the ability of a governor to grant mercy."" ""As I've stated from the beginning, I recognize and respect the natural feelings of victims and their families and I know this has been difficult for many of them,"" Barbour said in his statement Thursday. ""That is why pardons are always subject to a lot of criticism and are generally unpopular. Nevertheless, these were decisions based on repentance, rehabilitation, and redemption, leading to forgiveness and the right defined and given by the state constitution to the governor to offer such people a second chance."" And his lawyer, Charles Griffin, called the court's decision -- including the dissents and concurrences -- ""one of the most thoughtful and scholarly opinions I have ever read from any court."" CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: A surviving victim says he's ""totally in shock"" after the ruling .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea's sacking of Andre Villas-Boas came under fire Monday with former Blues boss Luis Felipe Scolari warning it will be ""hell"" for whoever succeeds the Portuguese at Stamford Bridge. Ex-Brazil national team boss Scolari is one of six managers dismissed by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and, like himself, does not believe Villas-Boas was given enough time by the Russian billionaire. ""England has clubs like Arsenal, where Arsene Wenger has been for several years, yet has won only two or three championships,"" he told a news conference for his present club Palmeiras. ""Chelsea's culture is very different, but this move is strange -- although it's not so strange to me because of what I went through there. Blog: Chelsea right to sack AVB . ""Villas-Boas was a champion and he will continue to be. He needed to replace at least seven or eight players, even since I was there, but he failed. ""It will be hell for whoever succeeds him."" Blog: Can English clubs catch Europe's best? But Dutch legend Ruud Gullit, who managed Chelsea before Abramovich took control, told CNN that he disagreed with Scolari. ""I do not think it is 'hell' -- I had a great time at Chelsea which I still treasure, for me it was no hell."" Gullit hinted that he believed Villas-Boas needed to have made better use of his senior squad members. ""The older players need to help the younger players know how to play the game, you can't ignore them by putting them on the bench and not in the team."" Richard Bevan, the chief executive of the league managers' association, also condemned the sacking Monday. ""Looking for what is an eighth manager in nine years is a serious embarrassment to the owner, the club, the fans and the league,"" Bevan told BBC. Bevan had spoken to Villas-Boas, who was ""very disappointed, frustrated (and) saddened"" by his dismissal. And Arsenal manager Wenger also believed that Abramovich had been hasty to remove Villas-Boas. ""I feel sorry for him and it's sad every time a manager loses his job because it's a job that demands a full commitment and I think he did that. ""I am sorry he was not given enough time to do his job,"" he told gathered reporters. Chelsea players have also come out in support of their former manager with central defender David Luiz thanking the Portuguese. He said on Twitter: ""Thanks AVB! You are an amazing guy! Big hug."" Midfielder Juan Mata, one of Villas-Boas' signings, also reacted on Facebook. ""It hasn't been an easy day for those who, like me, are part of Chelsea. I would like to thank the manager and wish him luck. ""We have to keep working hard and better days will come. Thanks for your support!"" Chelsea made a move to strengthen its coaching staff Monday after the departure of Villas-Boas by appointing former player Eddie Newton to assist interim manager Roberto Di Matteo. The 40-year-old Newton was assistant to Di Matteo at both MK Dons and West Bromwich Albion, but told Sky Sports his appointment had come ""totally out of the blue."" Di Matteo later told Chelsea TV that the club ""have to move on"" after the sacking of Villas-Boas. ""Andre has brought some very good, positive ideas and changes to this football club and we will benefit from his changes,"" he claimed. ""Our duty now is to look forward and to try to get the results that we need in the league, the Champions League and in the FA Cup to have a good season."" The first test of the new management team will be an FA Cup replay on Tuesday night at second flight Birmingham.","Sacking of Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas widely criticized .

"(CNN) -- Just like a popular celebrity, everybody wants a picture taken with her. On the street, people approach her to shake her hand. At public events and rallies, mothers put their children in her arms. And politicians don't miss an opportunity to pose in pictures right next to her, the closer the better. Her name is Josefina Vazquez Mota. The 51-year-old mother of three girls wants to be the next Mexican president. The fact that she's a woman, she has said, gives her a competitive advantage. ""Yes, I'm here because I am a woman; but above everything else, I'm here because I have a political career focused on serving people,"" Vazquez Mota says. Trained as an economist, the businesswoman and conservative politician is still married to her first boyfriend and high school sweetheart. She met Sergio Ocampo when she was 14. The couple has raised three daughters in Mexico City ages 18, 21 and 25 while leading successful careers. She jumped onto the national scene in 2000 when former President Vicente Fox named her social development minister. She was also recruited by Felipe Calderon, the current president, as education minister in 2006; she left that post in 2009. She has been a member of the Mexican congress twice. At her campaign headquarters in Mexico City we talked about a controversial book she wrote in 1999 titled ""God, please make me a widow."" The title was risky then and it's still risky today, especially for a woman who defines herself as a conservative. She says the book was not about bashing men, but about inspiring women to reach their full potential. The former minister says she came up with the title after seeing a friend of her mother's who had just become a widow and was reflecting on her newly acquired freedom to pursue goals she had given up on. ""It was a book to invite women to lose their fear, to be bold, to face challenges and solve life problems,"" Vazquez Mota says. Running for the highest office in Mexico hasn't been easy. She was once asked how a woman with PMS is supposed to be the commander in chief. In the February 5 primary election of her party, the PAN, she defeated Ernesto Cordero (a former finance minister and the party leadership's favorite) to win the nomination. Vazquez Mota says she has great admiration for other women who have become presidents in Latin America including Laura Chinchilla of Costa Rica and Michelle Bachelet of Chile. ""Bachelet warned me,"" Vazquez Mota says, ""'If you end up being your party's nominee you will be asked questions they would never ask a man. Don't ever yield to the temptation of wearing a mustache to govern (or try to rule like a man).'"" The first female Mexican governor took office in 1989. It happened 36 years after women in Mexico finally got the right to vote. There have been four previous female presidential candidates, but Josefina Vazquez Mota is the first woman from a major political party with a real chance of winning. Vazquez Mota is running under the PAN, the party of current President Felipe Calderon, whose war on drugs and strategy against organized crime has divided Mexico. But the candidate says she still considers the president right in launching the offensive that has left an estimated 50,000 people dead since Calderon took office in December 2006. Calderon ""has faced organized crime with great determination and courage. Anything else would've been tantamount to complicity. The president resolved to fight against this threat to Mexican families. When I'm president, there will be no truce with organized crime either,"" Vazquez Mota says. As the candidate of the conservative PAN, she puzzles some supporters by taking moderate views on core issues. She says she's firmly pro-life, but does not favor laws that criminalize women who undergo an abortion. She says she's against gay marriage, but advocates for respect of an individual's sexual orientation. ""It's not inconsistent,"" she says. ""When it comes to sexuality, I think the right of individuals to choose for themselves should be respected. That is a very personal choice."" In spite of her popularity (polls show she has made some progress in recent days) Vazquez Mota faces an uphill battle. Enrique Pena Nieto, a former governor from the state of Mexico and the PRI nominee, leads with double-digit margins in the polls in spite of blunders like being unable to name three books he has read. Vazquez Mota dismisses the polls and insists she still has a very real chance of winning the July presidential election. She also believes that the country that used to be known for machismo is finally ready to be led by a woman.","Josefina Vazquez Mota wants to be the next Mexican president .

"London (CNN) -- If you've ever found yourself in your local supermarket agonizing about whether the organic apples will be a more nutritional and greener choice than the cheaper non-organic ones, you're probably not alone. A new study reveals organic foods are not necessarily healthier than non-organic food . Year on year the organic food market grows as consumers look to make a greener and -- often thought -- more nutritional choice. A report by the UK's Soil Association revealed that consumers there spent a record $3.7 billion on organic products in 2006, that's more than 20 percent growth on 2005 spending on organic goods including food, drinks and health and beauty products. It's a similar story in the U.S. where -- according to the Organic Trade Association -- supermarket chains like Whole Foods have helped the organic food and beverage market grow from around $1 billion in sales in 1990 to around $20 billion in 2007. Total sales for organic food and non-food products in the U.S. are expected to surpass $25 billion this year. However, one possible spanner in the works for the organic sector could be the results of a new study by the University of Copenhagen which revealed that organic foods contained no more nutrients than non-organic foods grown with the use of pesticides. Researchers studied five different crops -- carrots, kale, mature peas, apples and potatoes -- which were cultivated both organically (without pesticides) and conventionally (with the use of pesticides) and found that there was no higher level of trace elements in the food grown organically. Study leader Dr Susanne Bügel said: ""No systematic differences between cultivation systems representing organic and conventional production methods were found across the five crops so the study does not support the belief that organically grown foodstuffs generally contain more major and trace elements than conventionally grown foodstuffs."" This study -- published in the latest edition of the Society of Chemical Industry's (SCI) ""Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture"" -- is the first to assess the nutritional value of organic fruit and vegetables. It should be noted that the study does not make conclusions about the comparative levels of pesticides or chemicals in conventionally and organically grown food or the health effects of consuming such chemicals. The study results could be seen to support the idea that shopping organically is a lifestyle choice. When the idea of organics being a lifestyle choice was floated in 2007 by then UK environment secretary David Miliband it drew fierce reaction from proponents of organic food, including the Soil Association, which represents organic producers. He told the UK's Sunday Times newspaper in January 2007 that organic food represented a lifestyle choice consumers could make and suggested that the use of chemicals and pesticides in non-organic foods didn't necessarily mean they were of inferior quality. So if organic foods aren't necessarily more nutritional, are they better for the environment? According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, traditional agriculture accounts for around 11 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions each year, and the nitrous oxide found in fertilizers contributes most to these emissions. Even still, in 2006 the UK's Manchester Business School assessed the environmental impacts of food production and consumption and concluded that there isn't a clear cut answer to whether the environmental impact is greater on a trolley full of organic food compared to a trolley full of non-organic food. Not so, was the response from the Soil Association. Do you believe organic food is more nutritional? It countered that: ""Overall, organic farming is better for tackling climate change than industrial agricultural methods. As well as lower average energy use, organic farming also avoids the very large nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer manufacture."" ""Additionally, organic farming builds up soil carbon, removing it from the atmosphere. Organic farming also supports more local food marketing, reducing food miles."" While the jury might still be out about whether organic farming is, on the whole, better for the environment, there is little doubt that it's a booming industry which is starting to catch on in other parts of the world. The United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that organic farming now accounts for around 4.1 million hectares in Asian countries like India, China and Russia. In India where the Green Revolution in the 1940s helped transform it into an agricultural hub, organic farming is slowly expanding in specialist areas like tea and spices. Perhaps an indication of the potential of the organics market there is that the Prince of Wales is looking to expand his organic food business to the sub-continent by the end of 2008. With a mandate of sustainability, The Energy and Research Institute (TERI) in India developed an organic farm in the small village of Supi in Uttarakhand in 2002. Here, local farmers are given the know-how and technical skills to develop their own organic enterprises. ""Local farmers are involved in cultivating oregano, parsley, thyme, peppermint, rosemary, rose geranium, artimisia, stevia, lemon grass, and several other herbal and medicinal plants,"" TERI's Madhu Singh Sirohi told CNN. The herbs are commercially available to hotels and restaurants in the area and Hilton Hotel executive chef Kuntal Kumar was so impressed with the quality, he's authored an organic cookbook which makes use of the herbs. Chef Kumar told CNN that organic fruit and vegetables only make up around 14,000 tons of the two million tons of food produced by India's agricultural industry, but that measures like the ""Original Organics Cookbook"" would help with wider awareness. ""Our approach is two pronged; firstly we are trying to build awareness about organic farming which is in its infancy in India and secondly we are trying to build awareness within the culinary industry in India."" Kumar is sold on the superior taste, color and texture of the organic foods he uses in his kitchen, and he says the response from diners has been overwhelming. ""The response has been very positive; they are overwhelmed that we are going so close to nature and that their food is fresh from the farmland to the table."" With increased consumer awareness perhaps it won't be long before the choice between the organic and non-organic apples will be played out in markets across India.","New study finds organic foods are not necessarily more nutritious .

"(CNN) -- Sir Howard Stringer will step down as Sony CEO and president on April 1, the Japanese electronics giant announced Wednesday. In a widely expected move, Sony has appointed Kazuo Hirai, currently executive deputy president, to replace Stringer as president and CEO, a company statement said. Stringer is expected to become chairman of the company's board of directors in June, when current chairman Yotaro Kobayashi retires. Stringer, the Welsh-born former journalist and past president of CBS Television Network in the U.S., was named Sony CEO in 2005, becoming one of only a handful of foreign chief executives of a listed Japanese multinational company. In a statement, Stringer said the decision was the result of succession plans that began three years ago. Stringer said Hirai has ""distinguished himself through his work in the PlayStation and networked entertainment businesses. ""Kaz is a globally focused executive for whom technology and the cloud are familiar territory, content is highly valued, and digital transformation is second nature,"" Stringer said. ""I believe his tough-mindedness and leadership skills will be of great benefit to the company and its customers in the months and years ahead."" Sony has faced an uphill battle in recent years. Its stock value fell 54% in 2011, hurt by a strong yen that dropped profits brought back home, as well as the twin crises of the March 2011 earthquake and the November floods in Thailand, which hit the company's supply chain. The hacking of Sony's PlayStation network last year, compromising privacy data of millions of subscribers, added to the company's woes. ""As challenging as times are for Sony now, were it not for the strong leadership of Sir Howard Stringer these past seven years, we would have been in a much more difficult position,"" Hirai said in a statement. ""The path we must take is clear: to drive the growth of our core electronics businesses - primarily digital imaging, smart mobile and game; to turn around the television business; and to accelerate the innovation that enables us to create new business domains.""","Sir Howard Stringer will step down as Sony CEO and president on April 1 .

"(CNN) -- Authorities treated more than 700 people for food poisoning after a political rally in southern Mexico this week, officials said. Exactly what caused the food poisoning was unclear, officials from the healthy ministry in Mexico's Guerrero state said Wednesday. Authorities were testing food and drink samples from the event and sending representatives to communities throughout the area to look for additional cases. Alberta Garcia Adame told CNN affiliate Televisa she started to feel sick after eating egg tacos at a rally Tuesday in Chilapa, Guerrero, for Sergio Dolores Flores, who is running for congress as a candidate for Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party. As the number of cases grew, doctors treated many patients at a local hospital and a temporary shelter at the back of a local church, Televisa reported. Guerrero State Health Secretary Rufino Dominguez said in a statement Wednesday that nearly all of the patients had been treated and released.","Authorities are testing food and drink samples from the event .

"(CNN) -- Most people don't go through life without hitting a few bumps along the way. For Lamont Peterson, that's putting it mildly. Peterson, 28, is sitting on top of the boxing world right now. In December, he won the light welterweight championship of the world, an achievement that was 18 years in the making. ""I feel blessed just to be here in this spot,"" he said. ""It could have been many other places I could've been."" Indeed. Peterson is one of 12 siblings. Growing up in Washington, things were going well until their father went to prison on a drug offense. They lost their home, and shortly thereafter their mother abandoned them, leaving the kids to fend for themselves. Lamont was 10 years old at the time. Some of the siblings latched on with friends. But Lamont and his younger brother, Anthony, were on their own. At times they had no place to stay and were forced to sleep on park benches, in abandoned cars and at a local Greyhound bus station. Sometimes they just walked the streets, waiting for the sun to come up. ""You'd play with your friends and you'd have fun all day, and then you knew at the end of the day, once it got to a certain time, your friends were going to go home. They'd be in their beds, warm, and you knew that you wasn't,"" said Peterson. And Lamont had to look after Anthony, who was two years his junior. That situation became even more stressful when other city kids challenged them. ""He'd have to fight for me because I was so small,"" said the younger Peterson. ""I guess that's how he got his fighting skills going and protecting me."" A few months later, the Peterson boys met boxing trainer Barry Hunter, and it changed their lives. ""They were just coming out of the shelter,"" said Hunter. ""I met Lamont and brought him to the gym, and I brought Anthony the next time. We've been together ever since."" That was 18 years ago. Hunter took them in and gave the boys more than just boxing lessons; he gave them life lessons. ""Those are my boys, man, I can't say nothing bad about them. I'm totally proud of 'em,"" said Hunter. Last December, the discipline and work ethic Hunter instilled in the boys resulted in Lamont winning the light welterweight world championship. ""It's something I've been working for a long time,"" said Peterson. ""Eighteen years now ... all the hard work paying off is just a great feeling."" It was a hard-fought bout with then-champion Amir Khan of the United Kingdom, a close match that some think could have gone either way. A rematch is in the works. But for now Peterson holds the title -- which also means a seven-figure payday. That kind of money is especially meaningful for a person who once slept on the streets, and is now the father of a 3-year-old girl. ""It's a great feeling to know that ... my daughter... she'll be OK, said Peterson. ""As long as I do right by, you know, the money that I earn, that she'll be OK. She'll never have to see those days."" Despite his success, Peterson said, he'll never forget what happened when he was a child. He's proof that it's never over unless you give up. ""Just because you're dealt a bad hand don't mean you're going to lose. You can always change it around,"" he said.","Top boxer Lamont Peterson is the light welterweight champion .

"(CNN) -- Some U.S. commanders in Afghanistan have ordered heightened security in the wake of recent events, a senior defense official told CNN Monday. Some of the precautions were put in place in the wake of the violence that followed the burning of copies of the Quran by U.S. troops last month, the official said. Sunday's fatal shooting of 16 Afghan civilians allegedly by American soldier have added to concerns. Shooting could impact military mission . The precautions could include, for example, adding a second U.S. soldier to watch towers, where before there was one American and one Afghan on watch, the defense official said. American and Afghan forces live together on many of the smaller bases and outposts, and on some of these the United States has instituted a 24-hour guard of their barracks. The official would not confirm the specific procedures in place at each forward operating base, but said, ""Those changes are all within the right of any commander to institute. I won't deny that several may have felt it was necessary to do so."" The official said battalion and even company commanders at combat outposts are ""given the discretion and authority to weigh their individual security concerns and take appropriate action."" He said the security changes ""are not coming from the top,"" meaning they are not directed by NATO's International Security Assistance Force or the Pentagon. The top commander of U.S. and NATO forces, Gen. John Allen, said the troops should continue in their mission, according to another military official, Capt. John Kirby. While force protection is ""always a priority,"" there has not been an increase in protection forces overall, Kirby said. Allen ""gave direction to his commanders on Saturday right after hearing about (the shooting) incident to continue to engage, to keep getting out there, to keep partnering with the Afghan forces,"" Kirby said in an interview with CNN on Monday. ""It's absolutely vital that we try to move past this. The only way to move past this is to continue to engage and to operate with the Afghan partners.""","Some precautions were put in place after the Quran-burning incident .

"(CNN) -- The New York Giants beat the New England Patriots 21-17 to win Super Bowl XLVI in Indianapolis Sunday after a dramatic finish. Trailing 15-17 deep into the fourth quarter, Giants quarterback Eli Manning found Ahmad Bradshaw for what proved to be the winning touchdown. It still left the Patriots with one final chance to move ahead but their star quarterback Tom Brady saw his final 'Hail Mary' pass go uncaught. It was the fourth Super Bowl triumph for the Giants, repeating their 2008 success over Brady's Patriots. Manning was named MVP for a superb performance, capped by his coolness under pressure in their final winning drive, his 38-yard pass to Mario Marringham laying the foundations for victory. ""It just feels good to win a Super Bowl no matter where you are or what stadium it is,"" Manning said. The Giants had made the more confident start and had the first score of the night as Brady made an incomplete pass from his own endzone and referee John Parry awarded a safety and two points to the team from New York. Super Bowl XLVI as it happened . It got better for the Giants soon afterwards as Manning connected with Victor Cruz for the opening touchdown. Lawrence Tynes added the extra point and they were ahead 9-0. The Patriots responded with a field goal from Stephen Gostkowski and were slowly working their way back into the game. It culminated in Brady being instrumental in a 96-yard drive, tied for the longest in Super Bowl history, as he finally found the excellent Danny Woodhead for a touchdown. Gostkowski made no mistake for the extra point and the Patriots were 10-9 to the good at the half. After the halftime entertainment supplied by Madonna, it was the Patriots who were calling the tune and Brady continued in superlative form as he set up Aaron Hernandez to run in seven yards for their second touchdown. It had been a 79-yard drive and on the way Brady made it 14 straight completions, breaking a Super Bowl record held by Joe Montana. Tynes, brought up in Scotland and one of several international players in Super Bowl XLVI, kept the Giants within range as he responded with a 38-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 17-12. Brady was sacked on the next Patriots drive, the Giants regained possession and Tynes converted again for a 33-yard field goal. So at 17-15 heading into the final quarter, it was anyone's game in keeping with the pre-match predictions of a close contest. But it was Manning who kept his nerve under pressure as the Giants claimed the biggest prize in the NFL after trailing at halftime and looking second best to the earlier brilliance of Brady. ""At halftime I said we can play better than this. They agreed,"" Giants coach Tom Coughlin said. ""We came out energized in the second half and the rest is history.""","New York Giants win Super Bowl XLVI .

"(CNN) -- Even after his debilitating stroke eight years ago, even after all the subsequent public appearances and New Year's Eves when his speech was slurred and his once-impeccable timing seemed to have checked out for eternity, Dick Clark still appeared somehow above and beyond normal physical laws. For decades, we had doubted he would ever grow old. This past December 31, you watched and listened as he counted backwards for yet another year, missing no numbers on the short path to 2012. And you thought to yourself: This man cannot be stopped. Like the promise of the U.S. Postal Service: reliable, no matter what the weather, no matter what time of day, month or decade. For almost 60 years, excluding the one immediately after his 2004 stroke, reliable and unstoppable was what Clark was. That is, until Wednesday, when Clark died at age 82. For those of a certain age, writing those last six words seems so improbable that you're not sure you want to expose them to light. Acknowledging them is like sealing a door to youthful paradise when what's now old and obsolete is forever sexy, frisky and fun. Some of you may find this bewildering. You're likely among those who knew Clark only as somebody your parents and grandparents watched on TV, hovering in a booth over Times Square every New Year's Eve, interrupting some pop music acts to tell people the Ball Was About to Drop on whatever the last calendar year was. As indelible as this gig was, it was only one of many Clark had as game-show host, restaurant-chain proprietor, media mogul and music impresario on ""American Bandstand."" It was in that latter role that most of us born after World War II cherish him the most. Between 1952 (when he was a frequent substitute for regular host Bob Horn when it was just called ""Bandstand"") and 1988 (the year before he yielded hosting duties in the show's final year to Dave Hirsch), Clark presided over ""American Bandstand,"" the most enduring and iconic of television programs, on which teenagers danced to popular records and watched pop stars -- from Chuck Berry to Chubby Checker, from Bo Diddley to Bobby Darin, from Jackie Wilson to Annette Funicell -- lip-synch their hits. First broadcast from Philadelphia, the show went from local to national in August 1957 and every weekday afternoon from that month until 1963, Bandstand was probably the only thing you saw on television between school and supper. Call it the mid-20th century manner of containing multitudes. And, for generations of kids, of marking time. And we kept marking time with ""American Bandstand,"" even as it moved from weekdays to Saturday afternoons and then to California, losing much of the funky charm of its Philadelphia days. Yet its format remained as predictable and comfortable as an old sweater. Kids still danced, records were still rated and pop acts from the Beach Boys to the Beastie Boys still came to play. Clark had begun building his empire in the late 1950s with a weekly Saturday night program of live, lip-synched performances, ""The Dick Clark Saturday Night Beech Nut Show."" It didn't last long, but Clark, as noted, was unstoppable. He had another spinoff series, ""Where the Action Is,"" in the 1960s and soon became as unavoidable as the weather by hosting ""The $10,000 Pyramid"" (which grew in other versions to $25,000 and $100,000) and co-hosting with one-time Philadelphia colleague Ed McMahon, ""TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes."" He invented the annual ""American Music Awards"" and ""Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve"" (first broadcast in 1972). These and other Clark productions enjoyed longevity that seemed as inexplicable and impregnable as Clark's youthful glow. Clark's personality throughout these years never wavered. Even as his entertainment empire grew to include radio shows (""Rock, Roll & Remember"") and restaurants (""Dick Clark's American Bandstand Grill""), he remained the personable young man keeping the party from getting out of hand. He seemed born knowing the secret of lasting long on TV: No idiosyncrasies, no temperament and no fretting. If you can keep your personality as smooth as your complexion, nobody will ask you to leave their living rooms, not even if the friends you bring along with you have strange hairdos and make even stranger music. And if you can adapt such a persona to places where such exotic personages as Little Richard and Jim Morrison hang out, you can carry it anywhere for a long time, making it look easier than it likely was. It was only in those last years, when Clark insisted on dropping by our homes despite his frail condition, that it looked harder. And even here, there was a kind of stoic grace that touched you, even if you started to wonder, if for only a second, how much longer he could continue. Now we know. Another myth, a grail of durability, drifts away, leaving us all feeling a tad more vulnerable -- and, maybe, much emptier -- than we did last New Year's. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: It seemed that Dick Clark would defy physical laws, last forever .

"(CNN) -- If there is anyone who embodies the fighting spirit of Japan's disaster-laden year, it is Homare Sawa. The 33-year-old is the captain of Japan's women's soccer team who lifted the FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany last June. Despite being huge underdogs her team made it through to the final of the tournament where they beat the highly fancied United States. Before the competition began the team had little financial backing and was practically ignored by the Japanese public still reeling from the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in Fukushima. So when the Japanese talk about ""ganbaro"" (Japanese for standing firm in the face of unspeakable odds), Sawa's success is a shining example of how it's possible. ""We fought for ourselves and for Japan,"" says Sawa. Before the matches at the World Cup, Japan's coach showed the team images of tsunami-devastated towns where nearly 20,000 people perished. ""It was hard to believe the images were of Japan. I became very sad, even though it was right before our matches. The images urged us to move forward as a team and we strongly felt that we had to get to the finals. We were very thankful that we could play soccer when there are many people affected by the earthquake,"" says Sawa. As the team progressed through the competition, the final loomed against the U.S.. Japan had not managed to beat the Americans in 25 previous matches. ""For some strange reason, I just didn't feel like we could lose ,"" says Sawa. ""I'm not sure why, perhaps a sixth sense. It wasn't just me either. My teammates were also feeling like we couldn't lose. Maybe we felt this way because Japan was giving us power."" Across Japan, fans watched in the early morning hours, crying and screaming as their team won against all the odds. The fairy tale wasn't over for Sawa, who was recently named FIFA's female player of the year. It was the high point of a career spent toiling in a sport that's unappreciated in Japan and underfunded by sponsors. Around 25,000 girls play football in Japan, but there are no professional leagues for women. Sawa herself played on a boy's team. The pay gap between the genders is stark and most of the members of Sawa's World Cup team have full time jobs and could only train in the evenings. Sawa now sees that lack of opportunity as an asset. ""Thinking back now, my technique probably improved because I played with boys and perhaps I became mentally stronger, too, because I didn't want to lose to them,"" she says. Sawa emerged as a gifted athlete, making her first international debut at the age of 15. She says she believed she would be married by the age of 28 and have children. But the dream of being the world's best player kept her on the pitch. That dream has been achieved and Sawa is now looking ahead to the Olympic Games in London. She hopes the disparity between men's and women's teams in Japan will close if her team can bring home a medal. ""If we can do well at the Olympics, maybe some players may switch from having to work full-time to part-time."" When asked if she feels she is a national symbol, Sawa laughs and shakes her head. ""No, no, no. Not at all,"" she says. She acknowledges that her win inspired Japanese fans and she does offer advice to young girls who want to achieve in sport. ""It has been a long time since I set the goal of winning the World Cup and I want to communicate the importance of having a goal,"" she said. ""It's easy for people to want to see results quickly, but it takes time. I'd encourage them to keep at it.""","Homare Sawa is captain of Japan's World Cup winning soccer team .

"(CNN) -- Three-time FIFA world player of the year Ronaldo announced his retirement from football on Monday in an emotional press conference which brought an end to his 18-year career. The 34-year-old former Brazil striker, who in 2006 became the all-time leading scorer at the World Cup, cited injury and a lack of fitness as the reasons behind his decision to end his contract with Sao Paulo-based club Corinthians. ""As you can imagine and you heard during the whole weekend, I'm here to (confirm that) I'm closing my career as a professional player,"" the former Barcelona, Inter Milan and Real Madrid star told reporters at a press conference. Ronaldo, who has struggled with his weight in recent years, also revealed that he has hypothyroidism -- an illness which affects the body's metabolism. ""Four years ago at Milan I discovered I was suffering from a complaint called hypothyroidism, which slows down your metabolism, and to control it I would have to take some hormones that are not permitted in football because of anti-doping (rules),"" he said. ""The pain made me anticipate the end of my career. My career was beautiful, was wonderful. I've had many defeats but infinite victories."" Has Rooney joined the ranks of football's immortals? Ronaldo has won the World Cup twice, in 1994 and 2002, and his 15 goals in football's premier tournament is a record. The two-time Copa America winner played for some of football's most-famous clubs, and also had spells at PSV Eindhoven and AC Milan during his 13 years in Europe. ""It's very hard to leave something that made me so happy. Mentally, I wanted to continue, but I have to acknowledge that I lost (the fight) to my body,"" a visibly upset Ronaldo said. Ronaldo won the now-defunct European Cup Winners' Cup with Barca in 1997 and the 1998 UEFA Cup with Inter, scoring in the final of both competitions. ""Il Fenomeno"" -- as he was dubbed after his time with Inter -- went on to win two Spanish first division titles with Real in 2003 and 2007. But Ronaldo has suffered criticism from Corinthians fans following the club's recent elimination from the Copa Libertadores by Colombia's Deportes Tolima. The supporters' anger led to the players' cars being vandalized and ""Ronaldo is a shameless fatty"" being painted on a wall at the club's training ground. But the veteran forward showed no ill-feeling towards the fans, and instead praised their enthusiasm. ""I've never seen fans with so much passion,"" said Ronaldo, who was a boyhood supporter of Rio de Janeiro club Fluminense. Ronaldo's footballing achievements have at times been overshadowed by controversy, starting with his late withdrawal and then reinstatement before the 1998 World Cup final against France -- which Brazil lost 3-0. He has had several high-profile relationships, and after a parental test last year showed he had fathered his fourth child to a waitress he met in 2002, Ronaldo announced he'd had a vasectomy. He hit the headlines for the wrong reasons in 2008 when he admitted picking up three prostitutes who turned out to be transvestites. Ronaldo accused one of them of trying to extort money from him. But despite his recent problems, he will be remembered as one of the greats of the game. Meanwhile, Roberto Carlos -- who played alongside Ronaldo for Real, Brazil and most recently Corinthians -- has also ended his stay in Sao Paulo and joined Russian team Anzhi Makhachkala. The 37-year-old, who was also a World Cup winner in 2002, had been with Corinthians since he left Turkish side Fenerbahce in 2010. The full-back is most famous for his 11-season stay in Madrid, where he won the European Champions League three times between 1998 and 2002.","Ronaldo has announced his retirement from football after an 18-year career .

"(CNN) -- Oppressed by war and poverty for generations, the Sudanese have struggled with terrible hardships. But the people of this vast country have a narrow window of hope to achieve progress by ridding both their nation and the world of a horrible disease forever. With support from The Carter Center and others in one small targeted area where cases remain, Sudan -- the last stand for Guinea worm disease -- could quickly eliminate this parasitic infection contracted from contaminated drinking water. Guinea worm victims endure the horror of a thin worm, up to 3 feet (1 meter) long, emerging slowly through a burning blister in their skin over the course of about a month after the parasite has incubated inside them for a year. This can be stopped by educating people to filter all drinking water and to stay out of water sources when they have a worm emerging to keep it from discharging new larvae back into the water. Click to see Guinea worm disease: Then and now . Because the worm requires a human host, it is within our control to eradicate it. Poised to become only the second disease eradicated from Earth besides smallpox -- which had different challenges -- Guinea worm cases have been reduced from about 3.5 million in 20 nations in 1986 to about 3,200 in 2009. Eighty-six percent of remaining cases in the world are in Southern Sudan, where violence continues to threaten the population and health workers. The few other cases are in Ghana, Mali and Ethiopia. I recently returned to Southern Sudan to visit an endemic Guinea worm village and met with ministers of health from Northern and Southern Sudan, who are assisted in their Guinea worm eradication effort primarily by The Carter Center and other partners, including the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sudan has reduced its cases by 98 percent since the eradication program began there in 1995, and we expect even greater reductions in 2010. But continuing insecurity is a major concern. In 2009, Guinea worm workers were forced at least 32 times to remain in their homes or offices or had to be evacuated temporarily because of violence or threatened violence, and areas affected by violence reported at least half of all cases last year. The greatest periods of progress have been when violence abated -- during a cease-fire lasting almost six months that I negotiated between Northern and Southern Sudan in 1995 to initiate the Guinea worm program there, and since the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Also challenging is the slow pace of providing safe drinking water in endemic villages, only 16 percent of which have even one safe water source. The campaign has hinged on providing cloth filters, health education, and a mild insecticide to kill the parasite in water. This has been effective in bringing us to the brink of eradication, albeit slowly. But wherever possible, creating new sources of clean groundwater can accelerate elimination, with the added benefit of preventing many other water-based maladies. This is just one example of how investing in disease prevention and eradication can strengthen the foundation for progress in developing nations. Across Africa, Guinea worm eradication workers have blazed new trails to prevent the disease in remote villages. Likewise, networks of thousands of volunteer health care workers have been created to identify cases, deliver cloth water filters, and ensure that their infected neighbors do not step into a water source. They form the backbone of a rudimentary health care delivery system that is both low cost and effective in fighting other diseases, too. A war waged to vanquish the fiery serpent . No one is working harder to eradicate Guinea worm disease than the Sudanese themselves. Sudan has a corps of more than 13,500 passionate and dedicated volunteer health workers -- foot soldiers of Guinea worm eradication under the very capable direction of the Southern Sudan Ministry of Health and supported by 41 Sudanese and expatriate technical assistants from The Carter Center. Whatever the outcome of April's national elections in Sudan and the referendum on national unity in Southern Sudan next January, ridding their nation of Guinea worm disease will show the world what Southern Sudanese can do when they are not distracted by war. This will be an important victory for Sudan and the world. With a little more help from their global neighbors, this achievement could be within reach very soon.","Jimmy Carter: Sudanese have chance to rid nation and world of a horrible disease .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan are all but through to the quarterfinals of the Champions League after thrashing Arsenal 4-0 at the San Siro on Wednesday. Brazilian striker Robinho scored twice as the Serie A champions dominated the first leg of the last-16 tie with the north London club. Kevin Prince Boateng put Milan ahead in the 15th minute with a sumptuous half-volley after chesting down a chipped pass from Alberto Nocerino. The Ghana midfielder's strike flew in off the underside of the bar leaving Wojciech Szczesny with no chance. Robinho doubled the lead seven minutes before the break heading home a cut-back from Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Despite the arrival of Thierry Henry in the second half (his last appearance for the Gunners before he returns to the New York Red Bulls) things quickly went from bad to worse. In the 49th minute, Ibrahimovic and Robinho combined again on the edge of Arsenal's penalty area before a slip by Thomas Vermaelen gifted the Brazilian a free shot which he put past Szczesny with ease. Robine Van Persie forced a fine save from Christian Abbiati in the 65th minute but it was a rare chance for the Dutch striker on a miserable night for Arsene Wenger's team. Ibrahimovic completed the rout converting from the penalty spot after he was brought down by Johan Djourou 12 minutes from the end. ""We were never in the game, we were very poor both offensively and defensively,"" Wenger said, AFP reported. ""It was shocking to see how we were beaten everywhere, it was the worst performance in Europe by far. There was not one moment during the 90 when we were really in the game,"" he added, AFP reported. The return leg at the Emirates Stadium will be played on March 6.

In the other Champions League match played Wednesday, Russian champions Zenit St Petersburg came from behind to beat Portugal's Benfica 3-2 in the first leg of their last-16 tie. Roman Shirokov scored twice while substitute Sergei Semak got the other. Benfica's goals came from defender Maxi Pereira and Paraguayan striker Oscar Cardozo, both after errors by goalkeeper Yury Zhevnov. Benfica took the lead in the 20th minute courtesy of a goal from Maxi Pereira before Zenit leveled the scores seven minutes later when Shirokov struck a sweet volley to score his first of the night. Semak put Zenit in front in the 71st minute before Oscar Cardozo equalized three minutes from the end. But Zenit responded immediately as Shirokov pounced on a defensive mistake to tap home the winner with two minutes remaining. ""My players showed really good skill. They showed a lot of heart to win the match in such a grave situation. However they did exactly what we decided to do ahead of the match. We won deservedly tonight,"" Zenit manager Luciano Spalletti said, AFP reported. Meanwhile in Serie A, Juventus missed out on the chance to go top after being held to a 0-0 draw at Parma. Juve's 10th draw of the league season (and their sixth on the road) means that AC Milan still head the league table but only by one point. The Rossoneri have also played one extra game. The result lifts Parma to 12th place with 28 points. In Serie A's other match Wednesday Guido Marilungo scored the winner for Atalanta in a 1-0 win over Genoa.

The Civil War, in addition to being among the defining moments of U.S. history, is also the source of some bizarre and surprisingly cool trivia. 1. Lincoln's first solution to slavery was a fiasco . Early in his presidency, Abe was convinced that white Americans would never accept black Americans. ""You and we are different races,"" the president told a committee of ""colored"" leaders in August 1862. ""...But for your race among us there could not be war...It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated."" Lincoln proposed voluntary emigration to Central America, seeing it as a more convenient destination than Liberia. This idea didn't sit well with leaders like Frederick Douglass, who considered colonization to be ""a safety valve...for white racism."" Luckily for Douglass (and the country), colonization failed spectacularly. One of the first attempts was on Île à Vache, a.k.a. Cow Island, a small isle off the coast of Haiti. The island was owned by land developer Bernard Kock, who claimed he had approved a black American colony with the Haitian government. No one bothered to call him on that claim. Following a smallpox outbreak on the boat ride down, hundreds of black colonizers were abandoned on the island with no housing prepared for them, as Kock had promised. To make matters worse, the soil on Cow Island was too poor for any serious agriculture. In January 1864, the Navy rescued the survivors from the ripoff colony. Once Île à Vache fell through, Lincoln never spoke of colonization again.Mental Floss: 6 Historical Events People Love to Reenact . 2. Hungry ladies effectively mugged Jefferson Davis . The Confederacy's image hinged on the notion that the rebellious states made up a unified, stable nation. However, the hard times of war exposed just how much disunity there was in Dixieland. Civilians in both the North and South had to cope with scarcity and increased food prices, but the food situation was especially bad in the South because outcomes on the battlefield were directly linked to the CSA's currency -- rising food prices were hard enough to deal with without wild fluctuations in what the money in your pocket could buy. Invading northern troops, of course, poured salt on the wounds of scarcity, burning crops and killing livestock. But in Richmond, Virginia, those who couldn't afford the increasingly pricey food blamed the Confederate government. Hungry protesters, most of whom were women, led a march ""to see the governor"" in April 1863 that quickly turned violent. They overturned carts, smashed windows, and drew out Governor John Letcher and President Jefferson Davis. Davis threw money at the protesters, trying to get them to clear out, but the violence continued. So, he threatened to order the militia to open fire, which settled things down pretty quickly. 3. The Union used hot air balloons and submarines . The balloons, directed by aeronaut Thaddeus Lowe, were used to spot enemy soldiers and coordinate Federal troop movements. During his first battlefield flight, at First Bull Run, Lowe landed behind Confederate lines, but he was rescued. The Union Army Balloon Corps got no respect from military officials, and Lowe resigned when he was assigned to serve, at a lower pay grade, under the director of the Army Corps of Engineers. In all, the balloonists were active for a little under two years. Mental Floss: 7 Modern Flying Car Designs . In contrast, the paddle-powered Alligator submarine saw exactly zero days of combat (which is why it can't officially be called the U.S.S. Alligator). It suffered from some early testing setbacks, but after some speed-boosting tweaks, it was dispatched for Port Royal, South Carolina, with an eye towards aiding in the sack of Charleston. It was to be towed south by the U.S.S. Sumpter, but it had to be cut loose off of North Carolina on April 2, 1863, when bad weather struck. Divers and historians are still looking for the Alligator today. But the undersea capers don't end there. A few months after the loss of the Alligator, the CSA launched their own submarine, the H.L. Hunley, named after its inventor. The Hunley attacked and sank the U.S.S. Housatonic off the coast of Charleston, making it the first submarine ever to sink an enemy ship. The only problem is that it also sank soon afterwards, and all eight crewmen drowned. 4. ""Dixie"" was only a northern song . The precise details of when composer Dan Emmett wrote ""Dixie"" seemed to change every time he told the story (and some even dispute that Emmett was the author in the first place). But he first performed it in New York City in 1859, with the title ""I Wish I Was in Dixie's Land."" Emmett was a member of a blackface troupe known as the Bryant's Minstrels, but he was indignant when he found out that his song had become an unofficial anthem of the Confederacy. He went on to write a musicians' marching manual for the Northern army. Before and during the war, the song was a huge hit in New York and across the country, and quickly became one of Abraham Lincoln's favorite tunes. The day after the Surrender at Appomattox, Lincoln told a crowd of Northern revelers, ""I have always thought 'Dixie' was one of the best tunes I have ever heard. Our adversaries over the way attempted to appropriate it, but I insisted yesterday that we fairly captured it."" He then asked a nearby band to play it in celebration. 5. Paul Revere was at Gettysburg . Paul Joseph Revere, that is the famous Paul Revere's grandson. Unfortunately for fans of the first Revere and his partly mythical Ride, PJR was in the infantry, not the cavalry, with the 20th Massachusetts. He and his brother Edward were captured at the Battle of Ball's Bluff in October 1861. After being released in a prisoner exchange, the Reveres rejoined the fight. Paul was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in September, 1862, shortly before he was wounded in the brutal Battle of Antietam (a.k.a. the Battle of Sharpsburg). Edward, however, wasn't so lucky -- he was one of more than 2,000 Union soldiers who didn't make it out of Sharpsburg, Maryland, alive. By the following year, Paul was promoted again to Colonel, leading the 20th Massachusetts at Chancellorsville and, in his final days, at Gettysburg. On July 3, 1863, he was mortally wounded by a shell fragment that pierced his lung, and he died the next day. He was posthumously promoted again to Brigadier General, and is buried in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Mental Floss: 10 Things to Remember About Memorial Day . 6. Mark Twain fired one shot and then left . At least, that's what he claimed in ""The Private History of a Campaign that Failed,"" a semi-fictional short story published in 1885, after The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, but before A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. In it, he recounts a whopping two weeks spent in 1861 with a Confederate militia in Marion County, Missouri. But he introduces the tale by saying that even the people who enlisted at the start of the war, and then left permanently, ""ought at least be allowed to state why they didn't do anything and also to explain the process by which they didn't do anything. Surely this kind of light must have some sort of value."" Twain writes that there were fifteen men in the rebel militia, the ""Marion Rangers,"" and he was the second lieutenant, even though they had no first lieutenant. After Twain's character shoots and kills a Northern horseback rider, he is overwhelmed by the sensation of being a murderer, ""that I had killed a man, a man who had never done me any harm. That was the coldest sensation that ever went through my marrow."" However, his grief is slightly eased by the realization that six men had fired their guns, and only one had been able to hit the moving target. 7. The armies weren't all-male . Hundreds of women on both sides pulled a Mulan, assuming male identities and appearances so that they might fight for their respective nations. Some of them did it for adventure, but many did it for monetary reasons: the pay for a male soldier was about $13 month, which was close to double what a woman could make in any profession at the time. Also, being a man gave someone a lot more freedoms than just being able to wear pants. Remember, this was still more than half a century away from women's suffrage and being a man meant that you could manage your monthly $13 wages independently. So it should come as no surprise that many of these women kept up their aliases long after the war had ended, some even to the grave. Their presence in soldiers' ranks wasn't the best-kept secret. Some servicewomen kept up correspondence with the home front after they changed their identities, and for decades after the war newspapers ran article after article chronicling the stories of woman soldiers, and speculating on why they might break from the accepted gender norms. Perhaps not surprisingly, in 1909 the U.S. Army denied that ""any woman was ever enlisted in the military service of the United States as a member of any organization of the Regular or Volunteer Army at any time during the period of the civil war.""

"(CNN) -- A series of text messages tipped off authorities to an alleged Columbine-inspired plot by two high school students to detonate bombs during a school assembly, according to a Utah police document. The plot was uncovered Wednesday at Roy High School in Roy, according to police. ""This was not idle chatter,"" Police Chief Greg Winham said Friday. ""There was significant thought, there was significant purpose, and there had been some preplanning and training."" Authorities arrested 18-year-old Dallin Morgan and a 16-year-old boy who, fascinated by the mass 1999 killing at Columbine High School, had interviewed that Colorado school's principal six weeks earlier. Both suspects are students at the school located in the Ogden suburb, approximately 30 miles north of Salt Lake City. The 16-year-old is currently in a juvenile detention center, and the district attorney has five days to file charges against him, according to Utah State Courts spokeswoman Nancy Volmer. Morgan, meanwhile, faces one felony count of use of a weapon of mass destruction, according to a court document issued Friday. He is set for an initial court appearance on February 2 to hear the charge, according to Volmer. Until then, he's free on $10,000 bond, officials said. Documents released thus far do not indicate that authorities found a bomb, though the 16-year-old did tell police that he'd previously made a pipe bomb using ""gunpowder and rocket fuel."" The charge that the 18-year-old faces specifies that he ""intentionally or knowingly"" either used, possessed or ""conspire(d) to use a weapon of mass destruction or a delivery system for a weapon of mass destruction; and/or did intentionally aid, assist, encourage, command or solicit another to do the same."" The unnamed person who received the texts that jump-started the investigation -- presumably from the 16-year-old suspect who is not being named because he is a juvenile -- alerted authorities to them, according to a probable cause affidavit. ""If I tell you one day not to go to school, make damn sure you and your brother are not there,"" one text message read. ""I get the feeling you know what I'm planning."" Another message said ""Dallin is in on it."" Other texts explained a plot in which the students would attack others and then make a getaway in a plane, authorities said. ""Explosives, airport, airplane,"" one text read, according to the affidavit. ""We ain't going to crash it, we're just gonna kill and fly our way to a country that won't send us back to the U.S.,"" another text states. Police interviewed Morgan, who they said admitted to being part of the plot. School administrators found a map of the high school marking where the security cameras are located, and where their blind spots are, the affidavit says. ""Initial investigative discovery has uncovered a plan to use explosives during a school assembly,"" Roy police said in a statement Thursday. ""Maps of the school and information about security systems had been prepared with plans to escape using a plane."" The pair had made use of flight simulation programs in the preparation of their alleged plot, officials said. After the arrests in Roy, authorities searched five locations for evidence, including two vehicles and two homes. The 16-year-old allegedly told police that he was fascinated by the Columbine massacre that occurred nearly 13 years earlier, when gunmen Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris killed a dozen students, a teacher and ultimately themselves. Columbine High Principal Frank DeAngelis sat down for an interview with this Utah teen on December 12, 2011, according to police. DeAngelis told Vinnie Politan of CNN's sister network HLN that he gets requests ""on a regular basis"" from people working on student newspapers, term papers and documentaries who want to talk ""about Columbine, school safety, things of that nature."" He recalled that the 16-year-old identified himself as a sophomore and student newspaper editor from Utah, who was ""in town (and) had some questions to ask me."" Describing the teen as ""articulate,"" the principal -- who has been at Columbine for 33 years, the last 16 as a principal -- said there were no ""red flags"" in his line of questioning. ""He wasn't asking about, Can you show me where the bombs were? Can you show me where people died?"" DeAngelis said Friday. ""It was just, What are you doing? How do you help your kids? And things like that."" According to police documents, the 16-year-old later told authorities that he did not want to be compared to the Columbine killers because he was smart enough to kill more people. ""It's pretty scary what could have happened,"" Joe Parrera, whose daughter goes to Roy High School, told HLN's Politan. ""It's a big shock to everyone, just to see someone plan something like this."" CNN's Jim Spellman and Stan Wilson contributed to this report.","NEW: The 18-year-old faces a ""use of weapon of mass destruction"" charge .

"(CNN) -- Phrases such as ""reviews you can trust"" and ""reviews from real travelers"" have misled TripAdvisor users in the United Kingdom, according to a judgment issued Wednesday by the Advertising Standards Authority in Britain. The decision comes in response to a complaint filed by a reputation management firm and two hotels, claiming that some of the claims of trustworthiness and authenticity on the very popular user-generated review site are misleading and can't be substantiated, since the site doesn't verify reviews. ""We told TripAdvisor not to claim or imply that all the reviews that appeared on the website were from real travelers, or were honest, real or trusted,"" the ASA wrote in its decision. The issue is overblown, TripAdvisor indicates in its response to the ruling, saying the requested changes have already been made to the marketing copy on its website. ""We have confidence that the 50 million users who come to our site every month trust the reviews they read on TripAdvisor, which is why they keep coming back to us in increasingly larger numbers to plan and have the perfect trip,"" the company said in a statement, noting that the ASA's ""highly technical view"" relates to two marketing phrases used ""in limited capacity."" The ASA's decision affects only TripAdvisor's operations in the United Kingdom, where the company has been under pressure from businesses that say some of the site's reviews are fake or defamatory. Chris Emmins, co-founder of KwikChex, the reputation management company that filed the complaint, said it receives regular inquiries and complaints from hoteliers who say that false TripAdvisor reviews are hurting their business. Unsubstantiated claims of bed bugs or food poisoning follow properties in online search results, and negative reviews are particularly damaging to small businesses since they don't receive a high volume of reviews and negative accounts tend to linger longer near the top of a company's listing, Emmins said. TripAdvisor's claims of trustworthiness are misleading, he said. ""Patently, that just can't be true when you don't verify the fact that it's even a customer making the comments,"" he said. TripAdvisor has changed course recently, replacing a ""Reviews you can trust"" tagline last year with ""Reviews from our community."" ""As with all marketing messaging, the wording used on the TripAdvisor site is constantly evolving to reflect different aspects of the business, which was the rationale behind a change back in June 2011 to put more focus on the TripAdvisor community,"" the company said. While TripAdvisor doesn't claim to be 100% free of fraud, according to the ASA ruling, the company told the ASA it uses advanced fraud detection systems and substantial resources to combat fraud. Emmins said it needs to do more. ""They could easily, with their resources, put in a tiered system which says 'this review has been authenticated,' "" he said. TripAdvisor points out that as a reputation management company, KwikChex has ""an obvious commercial interest in undermining people's confidence in user content-generated review platforms."" The question of verifying reviews is far from resolved. In addition to damaging negative reviews, false positive reviews are used by some companies to bolster their rankings on review sites. KwikChex has filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., Emmins said. The agency said it could not comment on individual complaints. Verified reviews or not, TripAdvisor's community is growing. ""It is very much business as usual,"" TripAdvisor said in its response to the ASA ruling. ""TripAdvisor was founded on a core set of principles -- to give travelers a voice to share their experiences, promote consumer choice and encourage a level playing field for everyone in the industry -- all within a free forum for sharing open and honest opinions.""","""Reviews you can trust"" claim is misleading, UK ad regulator says .

"Jackson, Mississippi (CNN) -- Investigative documents obtained by CNN show that former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, his wife and his staff may have given preferential treatment to two of the convicted murderers who were among the more than 200 former and current inmates he pardoned in January. According to the documents compiled by the office of Mississippi's attorney general, the state's former first lady, Marsha Barbour, apparently called a car dealership regarding the purchase of two vehicles for two convicted murderers -- days before they were pardoned. The cars were later delivered to the governor's mansion, two days before the men were released. CNN has also learned that a member of the governor's staff took the same two men, David Gatlin and Charles Hooker, to get their driver's licenses while they were still in state custody, before their pardons were signed and made official. ""Yes, that's true ... I did take some of them,"" said Barbour's former security chief, Wayland Adams. ""I knew that they were going to be paroled. I was assured of that and I just took them to get their driver's licenses. ""I thought that if I went ahead to get them a driver's license it would speed things up on getting them a job. And that was the only reason. I was just trying to help them."" Adams, who retired as security director of the Mississippi governor's mansion when Barbour left office in January, told CNN the former Mississippi governor did not ask him to take Gatlin and Hooker to get their licenses. ""No, I assume full responsibility for it,"" he said. Adams admitted his actions were a bit unusual. State law enforcement experts and legal experts told CNN that while this would be considered preferential treatment for any inmate, no state laws were violated. ""Unless a person has had his or her license revoked ... they are not prohibited from acquiring or renewing a driver's license while incarcerated as long as they had domicile in the state prior to imprisonment,"" according to a written statement from Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesman Master Sgt. Johnny Poulos. Poulos said his department was not aware of any directive from Barbour to provide licenses to the men. Either way, Randy Walker is furious. Nearly 20 years ago, he survived a gunshot wound to the head by Gatlin moments after Gatlin killed Tammy Ellis, Gatlin's estranged wife. Gatlin admitted he shot her in the head as she held their 6-week-old child in her arms. Police found the infant, still in her arms, alive and covered with blood. ""Where is enough enough?"" said Walker, who has recovered from his head wound. ""It should be enough that they gave a convicted killer his life back."" During his last days in office in January, Gov. Haley Barbour issued pardons to more than 200 current and former inmates. Most of the pardons were granted to former inmates who had already completed their sentences and were free. However, some of the prisoners were convicted murderers. Now, the legacy of the once popular two-term governor, who considered running for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, is being questioned by some Mississippians. The pardons were challenged by Mississippi's attorney general, but last week the Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the legality of the pardons. Five of the prisoners -- including Gatlin and Hooker -- worked as trusties as part of a state rehabilitation program that allows model prisoners to work as servants and handymen at the governor's mansion. They had access to Barbour practically every day, according to people familiar with the program. Barbour has said he believes the men are no longer a threat, that they are rehabilitated and deserve a second chance at life. ""That's what we as Christians believe. My wife and I are Christians,"" he told CNN's John King on his show, ""John King, USA,"" weeks after issuing the pardons. ""When we have people who get rehabilitated ... they deserve a second chance. It's the governor's job and the governor's job alone to let them have a second chance. That's why I'm very comfortable with this."" But no matter how one looks at this story, the benefits these convicted murderers received appear special. ""It's abhorrent that these people would be given this sort of treatment after the crimes they've committed,"" said Mississippi State Rep. David Baria. Baria, a Democrat, sponsored several bills to change Mississippi's pardons process. The bills all died in committee last week. He said the victims in the cases have put up with too much already. ""Not only to turn these folks loose but to treat them like kings, essentially -- it's outside the bounds of common decency of what we expect of our government,"" he told CNN. Gatlin and Hooker were released on January 8. They both had driver's licenses when they went to Gray Daniels Chevrolet in Jackson, Mississippi, on January 6. Records show Hooker bought a white 2007 Ford Focus while Gatlin picked up a gray Chevy HHR. Both vehicles were paid for with bank checks from Bank Plus. Both men put no money down. It remains unclear how the men were able to secure bank checks while still in the custody of the Mississippi Highway Patrol. When reached by CNN at the dealership, the salesman who sold the men the cars refused to comment. ""I am not allowed to speak about any transactions,"" he said. But the investigative reports compiled by Mississippi's attorney general's office show that Barbour's wife, Marsha Barbour, aided the transaction. In the report, the investigator writes, ""While at the dealership I spoke briefly with the salesman who stated that Marsha Barbour had contacted him regarding the purchase of vehicles for Hooker and Gatlin."" The details of the conversation were not available and it is not clear exactly what role Marsha Barbour played in the transaction, or the nature of her relationship with the pardoned men. The report further stated that ""the inmates had been brought to the dealership on January 6, 2012, in a black Ford Crown Victoria to complete paperwork for the sale and [the investigator] stated that the prisoners had paid with certified checks issued by Bank Plus."" According to the report, the car salesman also told investigators ""he delivered both vehicles to the governor's mansion on the afternoon of January 6, 2012."" When investigators asked Gatlin how he got the car, he allegedly told them, according to the report, ""I can't tell you."" When asked about the driver's licenses and the role of Marsha Barbour in the purchase of the cars, a spokeswoman for the former governor said the questions ""were based on assumptions of fact which simply are not true."" Spokeswoman Sherry Vance did not elaborate on which aspects of this story were untrue, and has not responded to CNN's questions for clarification. Walker, the victim who stared down the barrel of Gatlin's gun before he was shot in the head, said he's ""baffled"" by the allegations and believes Barbour is financially helping the men. ""Was it because he was a trusty at the governor's mansion and he had so much time with Barbour?"" he wondered. ""It's insane that he would do that. Where's my handout?"" ""I mean, I had thousands upon thousands of medical bills that nobody helped me pay. I'd like to get some of that money back that I wasted because David shot me. I didn't ask for David to come shoot me. Where's my handout?"" he asked angrily. CNN went to Hooker's home in Jackson several times and saw the White Ford Focus mentioned in the state investigator's report parked outside his house, but Hooker did not answer his door or respond to CNN's phone calls. According to the investigative reports from the Mississippi attorney general's office, Hooker allegedly told investigators that his son helped him buy the vehicle, and that his son had already made three months of car payments for him. CNN also went to Alabama to try to get Gatlin's side of the story, and found him living in the home of Ernest Jacks. His gray Chevy HHR was in the driveway, but Jacks said Gatlin refused to talk to us. But Walker has a lot to say. He can barely contain his anger that the man who tried to kill him could get such preferential treatment. ""I've been trying for over two years, since 2009, to get a face to face with Barbour, and never got a phone call back,"" said Walker. ""Gatlin must have made quite the impression on him.""

"(CNN) -- A powerful tornado ripped through West Liberty, Kentucky, last week, making the quaint community look like ""a war zone,"" according to the state's governor. Fortunately, the First Response Team of America was there to help. Founded by 2008 CNN Hero Tad Agoglia, the organization brought its specialized fleet of disaster recovery equipment to West Liberty. Since 2007, the First Response Team has crisscrossed the country, providing free aid to as many as 40 disaster sites. Agoglia recently spoke to CNN's Rob Marciano about the team's efforts in West Liberty. Rob Marciano: It seems like you got here right as the storm hit. Were you one of the first guys on the ground? Tad Agoglia: We arrived just a few hours after the storm went through this mountain community. It was very interesting trying to figure out a way in, because we have huge tractor-trailers. A lot of these mountainous roads are very windy, and there were trees down, power lines down. But we eventually found the epicenter of the city right where the tornado went through. Marciano: You've seen a lot of disasters like this. What was your first reaction? Agoglia: The tornado that went through West Liberty was pretty unique. Not only did it go directly through the heart of town and destroy all of the infrastructure that's needed for a community to get back on their feet, but it also went through the hills where a lot of folks were in their homes. (That) makes it very difficult for firefighters and emergency workers to get through those windy hills and access those home sites to do search and rescue. Marciano: What's the reaction to your team when you get into town? Agoglia: When we arrive on the scene sometimes, it is hard for these community leaders to really believe that we are here for free with all of this gear. But they quickly do realize that we are there to help and that we care. And when they see the equipment working and the light towers go up and the roads start being cleared, they begin to realize that we are good people and that we are coming with no strings attached to help them. ... They need tools and resources that they don't have themselves. And when they see us coming in with all the equipment ... they welcome us into the community because they know they need the help. Marciano: What are some key things your team does to help communities like West Liberty? Agoglia: After a tornado of this magnitude strikes a small community like this, the priorities have to be identified. The roads need to be cleared so that emergency workers like firefighters and search-and-rescue teams can come in and find the people and extract them to safety. They need lighting so they can see. It is very easy to walk into power lines or step on nails ... so light towers are important. So, we've cleared the roads, we've provided the light towers. This town has a small grocery store and gas station. ... It needed power so that people could get food and water and baby food and the essentials, including gasoline so that the emergency workers can have fuel for their trucks and carry on. Marciano: At what point do you decide: ""OK, our work is done here. It is time to move on?"" Agoglia: The First Response Team provides a unique service. It's that in-between phase, that gap when the storm first strikes and when traditional help arrives. Our priority is that first day, that first night and that first few weeks until traditional help arrives. Marciano: Why do you do this? Why did you choose this road? Agoglia: There is just something inside of me that feels compelled to help. When I am watching the news and I see those super cells go right over these small communities and heart of America, I know that people are going through some of the most traumatic times they have ever experienced in their lives, and I want to be there to help.","CNN Hero Tad Agoglia and his First Response Team provide free help after natural disasters .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The troubled Los Angeles Dodgers, one of baseball's most storied franchises, began receiving bids from potential buyers this week in a sale that's expected to set a Major League record at more than $1 billion. The field of potential buyers includes famous retired athletes, a talk show host and a former owner, CNN has confirmed. ""The preliminary bids submitted Monday reflect significant interest in the Los Angeles Dodgers franchise and its enormous value,"" a team spokesperson said Thursday in an e-mail to CNN. Among the bidding groups are retired Los Angeles Lakers star Magic Johnson and former Atlanta Braves and Washington Nationals executive Stan Kasten; former CNN talk show host Larry King and agent Dennis Gilbert; former Dodger stars Steve Garvey and Orel Hershiser; former Dodger and New York Yankees manager Joe Torre; Los Angeles shopping center developer Rick Caruso; and former Dodger owner Peter O'Malley. ""It's impossible to explain: it's a valued franchise,"" King said. ""They and the Yankees are the most famous franchises in sports in America."" Said Garvey said in an interview with CNN: ""We want to make it cost-effective. We want to bring it back to life. We want to make sure the culture within, inside the stadium, is reverent. You cheer for your team, and you accept the others."" Garvey's last comment was referring to fan complaints about safety and security at the ballpark -- especially in the aftermath of the brutal beating on opening day last year of a visiting San Francisco Giants fan, who was in a coma and is now recovering from brain injuries. The family of fan Bryan Stow, a paramedic from Santa Cruz, California, is now suing the team. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, known for being understated, looked pleased when CNN asked him about the financial heft of the bidders: ""They are doing OK,"" he said. ""You look at the quality of the people in each group, and they're very, very good -- excellent,"" Selig said. Finances have been a problem for the team. Six-time World Series champions, the Dodgers filed for bankruptcy last June. Earlier, in April, the league took charge of the financially troubled team. Adding to the team's woes are the acrimonious divorce proceedings between Frank McCourt -- the current owner -- and Jamie McCourt. Attorneys' fees for both sides in the divorce could reach $35 million -- more than what the Dodgers pay any player -- and Jamie McCourt's attorneys said that figure is unheard of in California divorces, even with its share of expensive celebrity divorces. Despite the financial and public relations problems, analysts say the team is expected to fetch more than $1 billion, breaking the record set in 2009 by the Chicago Cubs, which sold for $845 million. ""So much money is coming into this, really, whoever gets it, the Dodgers will be really happy,"" Lee Jenkins of Sports Illustrated told CNN. ""In terms of fans, I think it will be a quick fix. Whoever replaces Frank McCourt will be so good by comparison."" Hall of Fame manager Tommy Lasorda, who's a special adviser to the Dodgers, said he hopes the new owner will bring another championship to the team. The last time the Dodgers won the World Series was in 1988, when Lasorda was the manager. Lasorda isn't a bidder. ""We're just waiting like anyone else. Who is going to be the winner?"" Lasorda told CNN. ""Go out and get ballplayers. Do everything they can to give our fans -- who are the greatest fans in all of baseball -- give them a chance to see a championship team again.""

"(CNN) -- A last-gasp own goal from Sasa Papac handed five-time World champions Brazil a 2-1 victory over Bosnia in an international friendly in Switzerland. The Glasgow Rangers defender diverted Hulk's late effort into his own net to give the Selecao a win in their first outing of 2012. Real Madrid defender Marcelo had put them in front on four minutes when he fired into the net after a fine run and pass from Barcelona's Daniel Alves. Rummenigge hails 'major breakthrough' on international matches . Nine minutes later Bosnia pulled level as Inter Milan goalkeeper Cesar failed to prevent Vedad Ibisevic's weak shot going into the net from range. But Brazil, who boasted two-time world player of the year Ronaldinho and in-demand Santos striker Neymar among their ranks, received a late stroke of luck via the unfortunate Papac. Brazil's next major tournament will be the 2014 World Cup on home soil, and as hosts they qualify automatically, so the team will have to hone their preparations during a series of friendly fixtures. In Tuesday's other international friendly, Serbia beat Armenia 2-0 thanks to goals from Stuttgart midfielder Zdravko Kuzmanovic and Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic.","An injury time own goal hands Brazil a 2-1 friendly win over Bosnia in Switzerland .

"(CNN) -- Two pilots in northern California were lucky to be alive Monday after they escaped a midair collision without serious injuries. A helicopter clipped a small plane in the skies over northern California on Sunday evening, sending both crashing to the ground, CNN affiliate KCRA reported, citing the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office. The collision snapped off the helicopter's tail, but firefighters found the pilot sitting in the car of a driver who had stopped to help, the station said. ""She was a little shaken up, but she was completely with it,"" said Capt. Brandon Wilson of the Rio Vista Fire Department. ""Initially, she didn't want to go to the hospital. ""The person that was flying it was very lucky -- very lucky -- to walk away pretty much uninjured."" The helicopter, a Robinson R22, went down about eight miles south of the Rio Vista Airport, between San Francisco and Sacramento. It collided with a single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza, which landed near Byron Airport, some 20 miles to the south, said Ian Gregor of the Federal Aviation Administration. Footage of the helicopter showed it resting in a field. KCRA said its severed tail rotor landed about 50 feet away from the fuselage. The plane's pilot was not injured. ""Absolutely a best-case scenario, very lucky for everybody involved,"" Wilson said.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A man in an Afghan police uniform opened fire on NATO troops in Afghanistan, killing one, NATO said, in what seems to be the latest of dozens of cases of Afghan security forces turning their weapons on international troops who are supposed to be their allies. An Albanian soldier was killed, and three other troops were injured, including two Albanians and an American, according to the provincial government in Kandahar, where the shooting took place. The violence resulted from an argument between Afghan police and coalition soldiers who were distributing paperwork to students in the area, the Kandahar media office said. An arrest was made and the incident was being investigated, the media office said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force released a short statement confirming the shooting and the death without giving the nationality of the soldier or any other details. There have been at least 42 attacks by Afghan security forces on their international allies in the past five years, a top U.S. lawmaker said earlier this month. Most attackers were acting on their own, rather than being puppets of insurgent groups, defense officials testified before the House Armed Services Committee. France suspended its operations in Afghanistan this year after two such incidents left six French troops dead. U.S. Rep. Buck McKeon, a California Republican who chairs the Armed Services Committee, detailed at least 42 attackers, all members of the Afghan National Security Force, between 2007 and 2011. The panel heard testimony from defense officials who laid out delicate issues pertaining to Afghan security forces, among them the vetting of Afghans brought onto coalition bases to provide security. The defense officials said that in 58% of cases, the attackers acted on their own accord, perhaps over a personal dispute. Such disputes can arise from cultural misunderstanding, religious and ideological friction or combat stress, said Brig. Gen. Stephen Townsend, director of the Pakistan/Afghanistan Coordination Cell in the Joint Chiefs of Staff office. He said cultural training has been vital for U.S. soldiers, and now the Afghans are considering doing the same in providing better understanding of Americans. Another group of perpetrators involved insurgents who were able to pass themselves off as Afghan soldiers and infiltrate bases. The incidents represent a fraction of the total coalition deaths in the war but are are extremely damaging, fueling a mutual distrust in a critical moment in Afghanistan's transition, the experts said. The NATO-led military coalition is attempting to help transition local forces to take over security in war-ravaged Afghanistan as foreign troop levels fall. President Barack Obama has announced a U.S. withdrawal in 2014. France suspended its operations after four French soldiers were killed by Afghan counterparts in eastern Kapisa province in January. That shooting followed an incident in December where another Afghan soldier killed two French soldiers. ""The French army is not in Afghanistan to be shot at by Afghan soldiers,"" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said after the shootings. CNN's Masoud Popalzai contributed to this report.","Three other ISAF soldiers were wounded in the shooting .

"(CNN) -- Pollsters in Peru said Sunday that left-leaning Ollanta Humala looks poised to win the presidency, defeating rival Keiko Fujimori in a polarizing runoff election that pits the county's left and right against each other. Early exit polls released as voting closed at 5 p.m. ET gave Humala as much as a 5-percentage-point lead over Fujimori, the daughter of a former president who's serving a 25-year sentence for human rights abuses. Pollster CPI showed Humala with 52.5% of the vote and Fujimori with 47.5%. Ipsos Apoyo said Humala would win 52.6% of the ballots cast, while Fujimori would trail with 47.4%. A watchdog election group later released a quick count of ballots, showing Humala would win with 51.5% of the vote, vs. Fujimori's 48.5%. Official results are not expected until later Sunday. Still, supporters of Humala celebrated in downtown Lima, cheering the early results, waving flags and hoisting banners. One read: ""Ollanta, Presidente."" Peruvians went to the polls Sunday to pick their next president in a runoff election between two candidates with little in common. Humala, 48, narrowly lost a 2006 election bid, in part because many saw him as a close ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, intent on turning the country to the left. That's a point his rival, 36-year-old Fujimori, a right-wing lawmaker, hammered on throughout her campaign. At a closing rally last week in Paseo Colon, a historic avenue in the capital of Lima, Fujimori went on the offensive as she addressed a crowd of thousands. ""There are recordings and witnesses that prove that this gentleman is a good soldier of Chavez,"" she said to cheering crowds. ""I am not going to allow other countries to interfere in the sovereignty of our country. I'm going to defend it!"" Humala, a former army officer linked to a 2000 military uprising, has tried to distance himself from such perceptions, swapping his trademark red T-shirts for suits this time around. In a recent interview with CNN en Espanol, he denied his goal is a Chavez-style social revolution in Peru. ""When we speak about revolution, we're speaking about a revolution in education, which is something fundamental,"" Humala said. ""We have to build our own future. We believe that the Venezuelan model doesn't apply in Peru."" Like her opponent, Fujimori was forced to answer uncomfortable questions about her past during this year's election. She is the daughter of former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who is currently in prison on a 25-year sentence for human rights crimes. Many Peruvians credit the elder Fujimori with defeating insurgencies that ravaged the South American nation for years and for enacting economic reforms that stabilized the Peruvian economy. However, he is also criticized for corruption, having an authoritarian streak and the widespread rights abuses that were committed under his watch. During the campaign, protesters accused his daughter of planning to grant the former president amnesty if she wins, as she said she might do in a 2008 interview. She has since backed away from those remarks. Centrist candidates, including former President Alejandro Toledo, former Lima Mayor Luis Castaneda and former Finance Minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, cannibalized each others' votes during the first round of voting in April. In that round, Humala garnered more than 30% of the vote, while Fujimori ended slightly above 23%. Under Peruvian law, only the top two contenders advance to a second round. Peruvians are required by law to vote and some 20 million people were thought to have cast their ballots in Sunday's election. After the elimination of the more centrist candidates in April, Peru's 2010 Nobel literary laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, a former presidential candidate himself, described the race as a choice between ""terminal cancer and AIDS."" Andrea Stiglich, a member of the Economist Intelligence Unit team of Latin American analysts, said the election was a triumph of extremes. ""This election was meant to be the election of a centrist policy continuity candidate, and what we have is a first round that has yielded a result between two extremes in the left and the right,"" she said before the second-round vote. Current Peruvian President Alan Garcia is not permitted to run for a consecutive term. ""I will get behind whoever wins,"" he said on Sunday, before voting closed. ""The task (of running the country) is not easy and they (will) need everyone's support."" The new president will face many of the same challenges Garcia did: Persistent poverty, protests around the rights to natural resources and violence from remnants of a leftist insurgency that helped to make Peru the world's largest producer of coca, the raw ingredient of cocaine. On the eve of the election, five soldiers were killed in an attack in the country's southern province of Cusco, state news said. They were reportedly on their way to provide local police with additional security for the election when they were ambushed. CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","NEW: A quick count of ballots and exit polls put Ollanta Humala ahead .

"(CNN) -- Despite Baron de Coubertin's intention that the modern Olympics should promote a ""spirit of friendship"" among nations, the Games have never been as immune to the wider currents of international affairs as their founder had hoped. Hungarian water polo player Ervin Zador is covered in blood in the 1956 match against the Soviet Union. Few sporting encounters however have been as loaded with political symbolism as Hungary's water polo semifinal against the Soviet Union in Melbourne in 1956. The Hungarian Olympic team had left for Australia shortly after the beginning of the uprising that would briefly topple their country's hardline Communist rulers. From the other side of the world they watched as Soviet tanks rolled toward Budapest, crushing the new regime under their tracks. Protesters were gunned down in the street, while thousands were imprisoned and executed, including Imre Nagy, the leader of the ill-fated revolt whose withdrawal of Hungary from the Warsaw Pact and declaration of neutrality had prompted Soviet intervention. With the United Nations -- already divided over the Suez crisis and unwilling to risk an escalation of Cold War hostilities -- powerless to act, Hungary's Olympic team became an icon of their country's doomed struggle for freedom. One night early in the Games, the red star in the center of the Communist Hungarian flag that flew over the Olympic village was ripped out and replaced with the Kossuth Arms -- a defiant symbol of Hungarian independence. It was, therefore, spectacularly inappropriate that Hungary and the Soviet Union should meet in something so trivial as a water polo match when their compatriots had been involved so recently in real battles on the streets of Budapest. For Hungary's players, however, Olympic champions in 1952, the match represented a chance to strike a blow against their oppressors. ""In the strained political situation we were in, it was a body-to-body encounter with our opponents,"" recalled Hungarian player Gyorgy Karpati. ""Now I have to admit that I'm convinced even the referee was pulling for us. We were from a small country battling the huge Soviet Goliath."" Charged atmosphere . Played in front of a packed stadium, mainly occupied by Hungarian-born Australians, the atmosphere was charged from the start. When Dezso Gyarmati caught a Soviet player on the chin with his fist -- by accident or design -- as he wound up to shoot Hungary in front, the crowd cheered both the goal and the outbreak of hostilities. Hungary continued to dominate in the water, with star player Ervin Zador scoring twice, but the temperature of the match rose steadily in a series of violent clashes. When Zadorof, the water stained red around him, was forced to leave the pool bleeding badly from a facial wound, the encounter reached boiling point. The match was abandoned as the crowd spilled down to the pool side and the violence looked set to escalate into the stands. Hungary, who led 4-0, were awarded victory while the Russians left with a police escort. Hungary went on to collect the gold medal, yet any satisfaction the team may have felt was tempered by the knowledge that many of them had already decided that they could not go home. Most chose exile in Australia and the United States, rather than returning to a country that they no longer recognized as their own.","Hungary and the Soviet Union had been invovled in real battles in Budapest .

"(CNN) -- Chinese authorities have made dozens of arrests following a deadly clash between Han Chinese and ethnic Uighurs in the country's remote northwest, a U.S.-based Uighur leader said Wednesday. China's state news agency Xinhua said 12 people were killed in rioting near the northwestern city of Kashgar, including two shot and killed by police during Tuesday's melee. Xinhua said the trouble began when a group of knife-wielding assailants attacked people in a market. But Omer Kanat, vice president of the World Uighur Congress, put the toll at 16, including seven members of China's security forces. ""We have heard different accounts. We don't know exactly what happened,"" Kanat said. But local residents have told the group that the rioting began with a dispute between Uighur youth and Han Chinese settlers in a market, he said. ""The Chinese authorities already launched a crackdown and an arrest campaign after this, and according to our information, 80 people are arrested,"" he said. ""They are now looking for the people involved in this incident."" Neither account could be independently verified. Uighurs are predominantly Muslim ethnic Turks who are linguistically, culturally and religiously distinct from China's majority Han population. Chinese authorities have blamed Islamic militants of Uighur descent for previous outbreaks of violence in Xinjiang province, where Uighur-Han Chinese rioting in July 2009 left nearly 200 people dead and 1,700 injured. The massive security clampdown in the wake of the violence has angered many Uighurs, who make up more than half of the 9 million people that live in the far western region of China. ""This crackdown is ongoing,"" Kanat said. ""They restricted everything, every movement of the Uighurs. So the people are frustrated, and there is no way to express your grievances. Some individuals resort to violence, unfortunately."" Tuesday's rioting coincides with the opening of a new 3.64 billion yuan ($579 million) highway linking Kashgar to Yecheng, which lies 155 miles (258 km) to the south. Beijing says militant Uighur groups linked to the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, a separatist organization it says operates from neighboring Afghanistan and Pakistan, have been fomenting trouble in the region. In December, Chinese authorities killed seven Uighurs in a bid to free two hostages kidnapped in the rural county of Pishan, near Yecheng -- an incident the Stockholm-based World Uighur Congress disputes. The WUC said the deaths occurred when police opened fire on a demonstration outside a police bureau where Uighurs were protesting a recent security crackdown in Hotan city. And authorities in Xinjiang said last month they plan to recruit 8,000 extra police officers as China strengthens security in the run-up to a major leadership transition later this year. Kanat said additional police ""will not work, and there will be more violence."" ""But they are not trying to prevent that violence by listening to the grievances of the people,"" he said. ""They don't want to listen to them. They just want to suppress all dissent by force.""

"(CNN) -- Xi Jinping, the vice president of the People's Republic of China and presumptive next president, will visit Washington this week. Just a few months before taking over the top post in Beijing, Xi will probably be cautious about what he says and does, and stick to the script and avoid inquisitive questions. However, President Barack Obama should start candid conversations with China's leader-in-waiting about the pressing issues that define U.S.-China relations -- the most important and complex bilateral relationship in the world. For some time now, that relationship has been tense. Beijing apprehensively watches the growing American military presence in its neighborhood and the regional realignment driven by fears of a rising China. Chinese leaders are still haunted by U.S. ideals of democracy that had inspired political dissent in the past. Likewise, Washington is weary about China's ambitions and intentions. China's expansion of its naval force and recent veto of the U.N. Security Council resolution on Syria have been interpreted by many inside the Beltway as signs of new assertiveness or even direct challenge. Some speculate that a serious rivalry between the two countries could soon develop. There are many things that Obama can discuss with Xi. Is China really interested in driving the U.S out of the South China Sea? Will China help the West denuclearize Iran and North Korea? When will China fully honor its obligations to the World Trade Organization? And how can China and the U.S. work together against terrorism, cybercrime, or human rights violations? Our love-hate relationship with China . But no one expects all these issues to be sorted out in such a meeting. Perhaps most importantly, Obama and Xi should try to get to know each other on a personal level. Since no one knows what Xi really has in mind for China and its future, a productive meeting is one in which the two can start building trust and a good working relationship. To gain some insight on Xi, it's useful to look at his past. Born into privilege, Xi nevertheless spent several years in one of the poorer villages in China when his father, a top government official, was purged and then jailed during the Cultural Revolution. After his father was rehabilitated, Xi quickly climbed the political ladder in the Communist Party. Life's extremes have not made Xi noticeably radical or timid but apparently more prudent and reticent. He has had career shortcuts but worked hard to stuff his rÃ©sumÃ© in order to play the game of a semiobjective meritocracy, as have many ambitious Chinese of his age. His bona fide membership in China's ""Red Nobility"" makes him a princeling, which bestows on him the deep trust of the ruling elders in the Communist Party. In a nonhereditary autocracy, such a trust is paramount. To those in power who desire to preserve the current political system and dread a possible Chinese Gorbachev, the 58-year-old Xi is considered a natural successor to President Hu Jintao when Hu's second term ends this fall. Indeed, several hundred senior officials secretly endorsed Xi as their top choice back in 2007. Consequently, unlike his two predecessors -- who were handpicked by one man, the late Deng Xiaoping -- Xi is poised to bring more legitimacy and confidence to his office. His peaceful and orderly transition to the presidency this fall will signal a new page in the history of his country. Xi will be facing a fast-changing world and a faster-changing China. After 30 years of breathtaking development, today's China is greatly diversified and decentralized. Relying on authoritarian state control for order is becoming more difficult and costly, as social tensions and economic inequality increase. Xi will preside over the world's second-largest economy at a time when the overheated Chinese economy is long overdue for a correction or hard landing, which could happen as early as 2013. While China is secure and prosperous, its government still struggles with a perpetual mentality of being under siege. Defending the status quo will be a great challenge. Many incongruities make Xi intriguing. He has openly reiterated complaints about the U.S. and its allies, yet like so many of China's rich and powerful, he sends his only daughter to study at Harvard. Smart and low-key, Xi rarely steps out of the party line, and yet he spoke his mind in Mexico City not long ago to bash foreigners who are ""pointing their fingers"" at Beijing's human right record, saying they are bored and have nothing better to do. The world will be watching Xi closely to see how he will govern China and navigate U.S.-China relations. Over a quarter century ago, Xi visited America as a young cadre managing agriculture for an obscure county. This time, as the next leader of a great country, he may remember fondly how ordinary Americans received Chinese visitors with open arms back then and how much the two countries have gone through together ever since. Let's hope that he will open up to America on what he envisions as a mutually beneficial partnership between the two countries in the coming years. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- With 95% of votes counted, Miranda state Gov. Henrique Capriles cruised to an easy primary win in Venezuela on Sunday, garnering some 62% of the vote. He will face President Hugo Chavez in October. Capriles, 39, led in polls heading into the election. He cast himself himself as a center-left candidate and sought to appeal to voters across the political spectrum. ""Today, our people spoke,"" he told crowds of cheering supporters late Sunday. Calling for unity, he promised to work for all Venezuelans. Capriles won roughly 1.8 million of the approximately 2.9 votes cast in the country, according to Teresa Albanes, president of the electoral commission of an opposition coalition group. Capriles' closest competitor, Zulia state Gov. Pablo Perez, garnered some 30% of the vote, she said. Earlier in the day, voters queued up outside schools throughout the South American nation, where officials and observers reported that the primary proceeded smoothly. CNN iReporters sent pictures of long lines snaking in and around buildings in Caracas, Valencia and Maracay. The five opposition contenders for the presidential candidacy agreed on one thing: supporting whoever won the primary. The unified front could be a key weapon in the political battle leading up to October's presidential election, analysts say. ""The opposition realized that if they are not united, if they divide the vote, they can never beat Chavez,"" said Federico Welsch, a political science professor at the Simon Bolivar University in Caracas, prior to the vote. ""After Sunday, President Chavez will have an adversary with a face and a name. ... This time it seems like the opposition has a real possibility of winning. It's not a very high probability, but there's a chance."" Chavez's supporters have slammed the opposition coalition, saying there's no doubt the incumbent president will triumph in October. The candidates' hatred of Chavez is the only thing pulling them together, Rep. Jesus Cepeda said in an interview broadcast on state television last month. ""Hatred is the most detestable human emotion. And when it lodges inside people, it consumes and corrupts them to a point where they can't even think. The opposition is full of resentment,"" said Cepeda, a lawmaker from Chavez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela. Beyond a shared goal of unseating Chavez, there were other issues at play in the primary, including what to do about high levels of public spending, widespread security problems and inadequate health care, said Jose Vicente Carrasquero, who is also a political science professor at the Simon Bolivar University and who also spoke ahead of the vote. ""Chavez is running for re-election for the fourth time, and these are the same problems that he did not resolve the three previous times,"" Carrasquero said. Chavez has repeatedly hailed the successes of his government, arguing that poverty has declined and social programs have increased. The president has said he is confident he will win October's election, but pledged to step aside if he doesn't. ""If I lose the elections on October 7, I would be the first to recognize it and I would hand over the government and I would call on civil servants and the military, from the most moderate to the most radical, to obey the mandate of the people,"" Chavez said last month. Capriles, a former tax attorney, was the mayor of Baruta, a Caracas suburb, before winning the governorship of Miranda, which adjoins the Venezuelan capital. He was also the youngest vice president of the now defunct Venezuelan Congress. CNN's Patricia Janiot and journalist Osmary Hernandez in Caracas and CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Claudia Dominguez and Rafael Romo in Atlanta and Rafael Fuenmayor in Miami contributed to this report.","Henrique Capriles: ""Today, our people spoke""

"(CNN)  -- A pair of second half goals from Lionel Messi gave Barcelona a 2-0 win over 10-man Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal in the Bernabeu Wednesday. A scrappy and ill-tempered affair saw Real's Portuguese international defender Pepe sent off after 61 minutes with manager Jose Mourinho also dismissed to the stands for complaining about the decision. Earlier, a melee in the tunnel at halftime had Barcelona reserve goalkeeper Jose Pinto shown a red card by German referee Wolfgang Stark. It took a moment of typical Messi magic to break the deadlock, connecting with a fine cross from substitute Ibrahim Afellay for his 76th minute opener. And with four minutes remaining, Messi rounded off a fine night for Barcelona with a majestic second, weaving his way through the Real defense to beat Iker Casillas with ease. El Clasico: The billion dollar grudge match . It takes his tally for the season to 52, with 11 coming in the Champions League and leaves Real with an almost insurmountable task in the second leg in the Nou Camp next week. Mourinho's men had worked hard to cancel out Barcelona as they had to such good effect in beating them in the final of the Copa del Rey last week and the tactics worked well in the first half. Cristiano Ronaldo, the match winner in that final, came close with a shot which surprised Victor Valdes in the Barca goal and Mesut Ozil might have scored from the rebound. Barcelona had the bulk of the possession without looking their threatening best until the match turned on Pepe's dismissal as he lunged for a high bouncing ball and caught Dani Alves. The decision looked harsh and Mourinho was quick to show his displeasure and with the extra man it was Barcelona who capitalized with David Villa forcing a fine save from Casillas before Messi's double strike. An angry Mourinho hit out at the referee's decision after the match. ""Another miracle with ten men wasn't possible,"" he told AFP. ""Yes, I think we are eliminated. We will go to Camp Nou with everything and to get a result but I can't see it. ""We will be without Pepe and (Sergio) Ramos who didn't do anything and neither did I. I just want to know why? Why did Pepe get sent off? I just want someone to explain. Why did it happen?""

"(CNN) -- Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel claimed his ninth victory of an all-conquering season in Singapore Sunday but must wait to clinch the Formula One world title for the second straight year. The German took the checkered flag in the night race ahead of Jenson Button of Britain with Mark Webber, Vettel's teammate, in third place. The 24-year-old Vettel has a massive 124-point lead over McLaren's Button, whose fourth straight podium denied him the chance to wrap up the championship crown. He will surely achieve the feat at the Japanese Grand Prix on October 9, where he needs just a single point, after another commanding display on Singapore's Marina Bay street circuit. It was his 19th career victory. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso came home fourth and is third in the standings, one point adrift of Button, while Lewis Hamilton took fifth after a drive through penalty in his McLaren and no less than five pits stops. Another Briton, Paul Di Resta, was an excellent sixth for Force India, his best result to date in his rookie season in Formula One, ahead of Germans Nico Rosberg in seventh for Mercedes and Adrian Sutil in the second Force India. Felipe Massa of Ferrari, who collided with Hamilton in the early stages, finished ninth with Mexican Sergio Perez in the final points scoring position in 10th. Perez had a coming together with seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, which eliminated the German in his Mercedes. But once again it was Vettel who hogged all the headlines and he is set to become the youngest-ever double champion. ""I was in control at the end and it is a great feeling to win this race -- I love the track here and it's such a challenge,"" he told the post-race press conference. ""As to the championship? Ah, well, I guess I have another chance at the next race. ""It's not over until it's over,"" he added, but 2009 champion Button would have to win all the remaining five rounds with Vettel failing to score a single point.","Sebastian Vettel wins Singapore Grand Prix to extend F1 championship lead .

"Porto Santo Stefano, Italy (CNN) -- On board the Costa Concordia, thousands of passengers were dining, drinking, attending a magic show, perhaps trying their luck in the casino. It was Friday night on the luxury cruise liner, sailing in the Mediterranean off the Italian coast with about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members -- a night of entertainment and relaxation. There was annoyance, but no real alarm, when the lights went out -- not at first. Passenger Vivian Shafer said she thought it was part of the magic show. But those on board then heard an ominous scraping sound, and the 951-foot vessel gave a shudder. The ship began to list to one side. Still, many passengers were not panicked. Shafer said they were told the problem was electrical and would be fixed soon. Her cabin steward told her there was nothing to worry about. But there was plenty to worry about: the Concordia had struck rocks off Italy's Giglio Island and was taking on water. As it dawned on them that something was wrong, passengers headed toward the lifeboats -- accessible only on one side of the leaning ship. According to passengers' accounts, chaos ensued as guests rushed to fill the lifeboats and escape the ship. Some crew members helped passengers and then jumped overboard, passengers said; remaining crew members seemed helpless to handle the melee. ""Women and children first,"" a lifeboat crew member announced -- meaning families who were clinging to one another had to be separated. Passenger Benji Smith, who was on his honeymoon, made a rope ladder to climb down from the outer fourth deck to the third deck. He and his wife Emily clung to the ladder for more than three hours before they were picked up by a lifeboat. ""You were going higher and higher, and you were on a vertical position,"" said Rosalyn Rincon, a dancer aboard the ship. ""I was holding on to the railing."" Noise and creaks could be heard, she said. ""It was very, very scary."" Amanda Warrick, on the cruise with her brothers, said she thought several times that she might die. She and her siblings waited for at least an hour and a half for help after all the lifeboats had departed. ""Waiting was definitely the worst,"" she said. ""Because we didn't know who was going to be coming, how much longer we would have to wait."" Crew members were hard to find in the confusion, and little to no information was available about what to do or what was happening, passengers have said. Shafer said she wished the crew had directed passengers to grab warm clothes, coats or shoes, as there was time for them to do so. Authorities said no mayday distress signal was issued by the ship and are investigating. ""The crew tried hard but they kept telling us they had no information,"" said American Nancy Lofaro. ""It wasn't until an hour into this situation that we got into a lifeboat and were lowered."" In the haste, some lifeboats malfunctioned or were not operated properly, some said. ""At one point we were being lowered, and we were sliding off to one side,"" Lofaro said. ""Everyone fell into one side of the boat and were slamming into the ship. This happened a few times over 30 seconds. And finally we were lowered into the water level. It took 30 minutes to get to shore ... the lifeboats were slamming into each other. It was chaos."" Lifeboats on the ship's higher side became stuck, leaving people suspended in mid-air amid the screams and cries of children, said passenger Laurie Willits. Some passengers braved the water, with a temperature of about 57 degrees, and swam to safety. Others had no choice, as they fell into the chilly water. Nighttime temperatures on Giglio have recently dipped below freezing. On shore, sirens blared as some of the 20 injured were taken to hospitals. Helicopters plucked some passengers off the ship's decks. Many of those rescued were taken to churches and other buildings for shelter, some of them wearing the pajamas and slippers they had on when they left the ship. Cruise passengers are required by law to attend a safety briefing within 24 hours of embarkation. But passenger Benji Smith said the briefing was more of a ""sales pitch"" for shore excursions. Others, who embarked at Civitavecchia, about an hour's train ride from Rome, had yet to have the briefing. As the Concordia came to rest on its side, a huge gash in its hull, rescue efforts were launched to locate those left unaccounted for, with rescuers working underwater in near-total darkness to scour the ship -- which has 17 decks and some 1,500 cabins, eight bars, five restaurants, four swimming pools and a casino. Three survivors were found -- an Italian purser and two South Korean honeymooners. However, others were not so lucky. The bodies of two elderly people, both wearing life jackets, were found near one of the ship's restaurants. And a 65-year-old woman died after suffering a heart attack, authorities said. Another body was found Monday, bringing the death toll to six. That toll could rise, especially in light of Italian coast guard chief Marco Brusco's revelation in a television interview, as reported by the state ANSA news agency, that 29 people are unaccounted for. That figure includes two of the 120 Americans who were aboard the ship, the U.S. Embassy in Italy said. Rescue efforts were suspended for a few hours Monday after the vessel began to shift and move, Giglio Mayor Sergio Ortelli said. They resumed later in the day, although the Italian coast guard said it was concerned about increasing winds in the forecast. Rough seas were also forecast for the area on Monday. Pier Luigi Foschi, Costa Cruises chairman and chief executive, told reporters he holds out hope others may still be alive. The ship has about 2,300 tons of fuel on board, Foschi said, adding that so far there is ""absolutely no evidence of fuel leaking into the sea."" As rescuers worked to find survivors and recover bodies, the Italian Coast Guard -- as well as Carnival Corporation, the parent company of Costa Cruises -- launched investigations into what went wrong. On Saturday, the ship's captain, Francesco Schettino, was detained and faces possible charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board, authorities said. The ship's data recorders were seized and were being analyzed by prosecutors. Schettino has denied abandoning ship, saying he and his crew were the last to leave the Concordia. Speaking on Italian television, he insisted the rocks were not marked on his map. However, the coast guard maintained the waters are well-mapped, and local fishermen say Giglio's coast is known for its rocky sea floor. The Concordia was too close to the island, authorities have said, and was investigating why. One potential theory: Apparently the Concordia had a tradition of ""a kind of fly-by"" with Giglio island, where it would approach the island, those on board would wave and the ship would sound its horn, said CNN's Dan Rivers. It was unclear whether such a maneuver was being attempted and the ship got too close. On Sunday, Costa Cruises said in a statement there may have been ""significant human error"" on Schettino's part. ""The route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,"" the statement said. However, Costa also defended its crew, saying crew members ""acted bravely and swiftly to help evacuate more than 4,000 individuals during a very challenging situation."" Schettino's attorney, Bruno Leporatti, said in a statement Monday the captain was ""shattered, dismayed, saddened for the loss of lives and strongly disturbed"" over the incident. But, he said, Schettino was ""comforted by the fact that he maintained during those moments the necessary lucidity to put in place a difficult emergency maneuver"" -- steering the boat into shallow water, which saved lives. Schettino is set to appear in court Tuesday, where he will be questioned in a closed hearing.

"(CNN) -- Jenson Button recorded a dramatic victory during a rain-affected Hungarian Grand Prix to toast the 200th race of his Formula One career in style. On an action packed afternoon the British McLaren driver opted for the right set of tires to negotiate a late burst of rain, while teammate Lewis Hamilton, who led for long periods, toiled. A drive-through penalty put pay to Hamilton's hopes of winning as Button crossed the line ahead of championship leader Sebastian Vettel in his Red Bull and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. On the track where he won his first ever grand prix, Button's victory was his second of the Formula One season, though Vettel heads for the mid season break with a lead in the drivers' championship of 85 points. Latest F1 standings after Hungarian Grand Prix . ""It's a great moment, all round a major weekend. For some reason I like these conditions. This is the first place where I won a grand prix, in 2006, in these sorts of conditions,"" Button told reporters. ""I'm always lucky with these conditions. You are not always going to make the right call in these conditions but I feel I'm pretty good at making the right call when it comes to tire choices -- but I'm not the only one. ""We had good pace today and I was able to make the soft tires last. The reason why we won today was because we were quick. If it didn't rain it wouldn't have made any difference."" On a wet track Vettel soon relinquished the lead after running wide on a corner and Hamilton opened up a gap over the rest of the field as he successfully handled the first two pit stops. But on his third stop he opted for soft tires, with the track now dry in most places, while Button followed the lead of Red Bull's Mark Webber by taking on prime tires. The difference proved crucial 20 laps later as a shower heralded a return to the slippery conditions seen earlier in the race. Button and Hamilton wrestled for the lead, and it changed hands several times before Hamilton returned to the pits to change to intermediate tires for more grip. And although Hamilton was ordered to observe a drive-through penalty for spinning in front of the Force India car of Paul di Resta, he used his fresh tires to good effect as he battled past Webber to finish the race in fourth place. ""Jenson was pushing me hard the whole race and the better man won today,"" said Hamilton. ""I was struggling a lot with the graining on my left front tires. I don't know whether that was my fault by pushing too hard."" Vettel struggled with brake problems and slid off the track on several occasions but dug in to claim second and go into the mid-season break as the favorite to retain his world title. He said: ""It was more important to bring the car home but all in all it's fair to say that Ferrari and McLaren on race pace in the last couple of events have made a step forwards."" There was also drama for Nick Heidfeld as his Renault caught fire and exploded shortly after he left the pits. The German managed to leap out of his car unharmed.","McLaren's Jenson Button wins the Hungarian Grand Prix .
