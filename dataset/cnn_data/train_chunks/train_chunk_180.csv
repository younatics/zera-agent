"(CNN) -- U.S.-Russian sniping over Syria's growing conflict isn't the early frost of a new Cold War, but it highlights the chilly spots that remain between the onetime foes, longtime observers say. The Obama administration came into office promising a ""reset"" of relations with Moscow after the 2008 conflict between Russia and the former Soviet republic of Georgia, a prospective NATO ally. That helped pave the way for a new strategic arms control treaty, a revamping of U.S. missile defense plans that Russia opposed and greater Russian support for sanctions aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear development. ""I think that the good ties that are associated with the reset came from an analysis from both sides that there were issues where both sides had a set of common interests, and both sides could pursue those interests and do business with one another,"" said James Goldgeier, the dean of the American University School of International Service and a veteran Russian analyst. G-20 nations must 'do what's necessary' to boost world economy, Obama says . However, Goldgeier added, ""What we've seen recently is there are still issues that divide the United States and Russia, on issues where there aren't common interests."" And topping that list today is Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad's crackdown on a popular uprising spawned by the ""Arab Spring"" revolts across the region now threatens to become a full-blown civil war. At least 10,000 people have been killed -- opposition groups say 13,000 -- and a U.N.-Arab League cease-fire plan has all but collapsed. The United States, its Western allies and leading Arab states have condemned al-Assad, whose family has ruled Syria since 1971. But Russia has stood behind its longtime allies in Damascus, blocking action in the U.N. Security Council and warning against outside intervention on behalf of the opposition. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin met Monday on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, and discussed the Syrian conflict. It was the first face-to-face talk between the two leaders since Putin returned to the president's office this year. After the nearly two-hour talk, Obama said the two had ""agreed that we need to see a cessation of the violence, that a political process has to be created to prevent civil war."" About a third of the session was devoted to Syria, said Mike McFaul, U.S. ambassador to Russia. Both Obama and Putin ""wanted to make sure the other side of the table understood the true motivations for what they're trying to do and what they're trying not to do."" The tension between Washington and Moscow flared last week when U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accused Russia of shipping helicopters to Syria, where opposition groups say they are being used against civilians. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Thursday that his government isn't selling al-Assad any equipment that could be used against protesters, just delivering air defense systems under contracts struck years ago -- though another Russian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN that Russia is refurbishing older copters it had sold previously. On Monday, U.K. marine insurer The Standard Club said it had stopped coverage for Russian operator Femco's cargo ship, MV Alaed, amid allegations that the ship is carrying weapons to Syria. Ship-tracking data showed the Alaed was off the northern coast of Scotland on Monday. U.S. officials have said the ship is heading for Syria with attack helicopters and munitions. American officials said Friday they were tracking the Nikolay Filchenov, a Russian military cargo ship believed to be bound for Syria. RIA Novosti, Russia's state-run news agency, denied the report Monday, citing a source in the Black Sea Fleet as saying the Nikolay Filchenov remained docked at its base in Sevastopol. Russia stood aside as the Security Council authorized international intervention in the Libyan revolt that toppled longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. But Syria ""is a place where Russia has real interests at stake,"" said Matt Rojansky, deputy director of the Russia-Eurasia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ""The problem for the Russians is Assad just isn't very effective,"" he said. Rather than crushing the revolt against him, ""It seems that everything he does just inflames it even more."" That gives the U.S. and its allies the opening to put more pressure on al-Assad, who took power after his father's death in 2000. ""The Russians would love to see those arguments go away and get back to geopolitics,"" Rojansky said. ""But those arguments are not going to go away while more civilians are getting killed, and the Russians understand that."" 'Entire families trapped under the rubble,' Syrian opposition says . Meanwhile, he said officials in Moscow see U.S. support for the Syrian opposition as another ""encroachment"" on their backyard. ""They see this in part of the same continuum of what's been happening in post-Soviet states over the past decade,"" Rojansky said. Previous American support for reform movements in former Soviet republics ""creates a bunch of problems in the neighborhood,"" while the U.S. stance against Iran's nuclear program is seen as another push for ""regime change,"" he said. And Martin Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel and assistant secretary of state in the Clinton administration, told CNN's ""Amanpour"" program that the top Russian priority is ""that at the end of the day, Syria not be taken out from the Russian column and put in the American column."" ""We don't have a very good track record on reassuring them of that, because essentially, that's what we've gone around doing since the Cold War,"" he said. ""So, there's a real mistrust of our intentions there, notwithstanding assurances that we might be trying to give there."" But neither side wants to see the Syrian conflict spread to neighboring countries such as Lebanon, which has been torn between pro- and anti-Syrian factions in recent years. And the United States needs Russian help with Iran, which has defied U.N. demands that it stop producing nuclear fuel amid Western and Israeli accusations that it is driving toward nuclear weapons. Opinion: Why Putin can't be forced to deal . That could leave Washington in a grim position, Indyk said. ""It is a real irony that on the one hand, we're expecting Lavrov to go off to Tehran in these coming days and deliver a more flexible position on the part of Iranians towards the offer that's on the table in the nuclear talks that are going to take place in Moscow, in which we're heavily dependent on the Russians to cooperate with us and pressure the Iranians,"" he said. ""And at the same time, we're beating them over the head for being too supportive of the Assad regime, particularly by providing these attack helicopters. ""It's a very hard balancing game, and there is this tension between them that is not easily reconciled,"" Indyk said. ""So, ultimately, I think we're going to have to decide which one is more important to us. And I suspect that, at the end of the day, it will be the Iranian issue and the nuclear weapons programs we run that trumps concern about what's happening in Syria."" And Goldgeier said the Syrian crisis is a reminder that ""fundamental differences"" remain between the former Cold War antagonists, ""and what's happening in Syria exposes the limits of the relationship between U.S. and Russia."" ""It's not the Cold War. It's not going to be the Cold War,"" he said. But the dispute over Syria ""could be as serious as the Georgian war, because it does expose a Russian approach that is fundamentally at odds with Western interests -- really, in this case everyone else's interests.""

"Brunswick, Georgia (CNN) -- The mother and the aunt of one of the two teenage boys accused of fatally shooting a 13-month-old baby in Brunswick, Georgia, have been arrested, according to documents in the case. Seventeen-year-old murder suspect De'Marquise Elkins' mother, Karimah Aisha Elkins, 36, and his aunt, Katrina Latrelle Elkins, 33, are accused of ""false statements or writings,"" among other charges, the complaint said. Authorities held both women in the Glynn County Detention Center until they were released on $1,104 bond. Katrina Elkins also was held for an unrelated probation violation. Also Tuesday, police investigating the case found a weapon and are trying to determine if it is connected to the shooting, a Brunswick police spokesman said. Last Thursday, Sherry West told reporters she was pushing her baby in a stroller in broad daylight when two teenagers approached her. One demanded money and pointed at her what West first thought was a fake gun. But he fired at her, missing her head and hitting her in the leg, West said, and then the teen shot her baby in the face. Both of the suspects were charged with murder last week, and made their first appearance in court Monday. Wearing an orange jumpsuit, his hands and feet shackled, the 15-year-old listened as Glynn County Judge Timothy Barton read him his Miranda rights. The younger suspect is not being identified because of his age. Previously, the boy's age was reported as 14. Authorities have not yet said whether the teen will be considered a juvenile or adult, and the teen did not enter a plea. Asked if he had any questions, the teen told the judge, ""no sir."" The 15-year-old's mother, Brenda Moses, said her son was ""just a witness,"" and that ""he didn't do anything wrong."" ""My feelings go out to the mother, and the baby and my baby,"" Moses said. ""They've handled this investigation wrong, and the truth is going to come out."" Baby shot dead in stroller; 2 Georgia teens charged . Elkins also did not enter a plea when he appeared in court Monday. He was dressed in regular clothes, but his hands and feet were handcuffed and he wore a belt shackle. Elkins' attorney, Jonathan Lockwood, spoke for him during the appearance. When he arrived in the courtroom, the teen turned to his mother, Karimah Elkins, and nodded. At the end of the appearance, she said, ""I love you, Marquise."" ""I'll never hear his first word' West said she was her way home Thursday from the post office last week when she was confronted by the teens. ""I thought he was just using a toy gun to scare me. And then he shot at my head, and the bullet grazed my ear and the side of my head, and then he shot me in the leg, and I still thought that it was a fake gun,"" she told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live."" ""He kept asking me (for money), and I kept telling him I don't have any,"" she said. ""He shot my baby in the face, and then I knew it was a real gun."" West, 42, said she started screaming. She took her son out of his harness and started CPR. She saw his lungs inflate but couldn't get a pulse, she said. Police and medical personnel took over when they arrived, West said, but it was too late. Her son died. ""I'll never hear his first word,"" West said. Baby's death marks 2nd time Georgia mom loses a son to violence . West has said she has no doubt that authorities have her baby's killer in custody: ""It's definitely him."" ""I just hope, you know, that the shooter dies. I mean, I had to watch my baby die and I want him to die. A life for a life,"" she said. Immediately after the shooting, detectives searched her home for a gun and conducted gun residue tests on both her and the baby's father, West said, adding that the tests were negative and the search did not turn up a gun. Citing the ongoing investigation, police spokesman Todd Rhodes declined to comment when asked about the search and those tests. West also said she gave a detective a jacket she was wearing at the time of the shooting. She told police she was grabbed or shoved briefly by the suspected shooter, and they hope to lift a fingerprint off the jacket, she said. This isn't the first time West has lost a son to violence. Her 18-year-old son was stabbed to death in 2008 in New Jersey, she said. ""This is the second child that people have taken from me in a tragic way,"" West said. ""I'm so afraid to have any more babies now. I tried to raise really good kids in a wicked world."" 911 calls reveal witnesses' horror . Police in the coastal city of Brunswick released to CNN three recordings of 911 calls about Thursday's shooting. ""A baby has been shot!"" one woman said in a 911 call. The exchange with the emergency operator was emotionally charged. ""Listen to me, ma'am! Is the baby breathing?"" the operator replied. ""I don't know,"" the woman said. She began to cry. ""Listen to me!"" the operator said to the weeping woman. ""We have people en route. Did you hear shots in the area?"" Yes, she heard shots, she said. ""Be calm,"" the operator said. ""How many shots did you hear?"" ""I heard like three shots. And the baby has been shot in the head,"" the woman said. The woman was so distraught that she passed her cell phone to a man walking his dog. ""No, the baby is not breathing,"" the man told the operator. ""The baby was shot in the head?"" the operator continued. ""Yes, right between the eyes,"" the man said, adding that he earlier heard a ""small-caliber clap."" As he spoke, sirens wailed as police arrived on the scene, and the man broke off the phone call.","NEW: Mom, aunt accused of ""false statement or writings""

"(CNN) -- In case you think your weekends are filling up now that spring is here, consider the humdinger of a three-day stretch Louisville coach Rick Pitino might face in Atlanta starting April 6. Saturday: Coach a team in the Final Four for the seventh time, tying North Carolina coach Roy Williams for the fourth most in NCAA history. Only John Wooden (12), Mike Krzyzewski (11) and Dean Smith (11) have coached in more. Sunday: Receive official word from the Naismith Hall of Fame that he has been chose for induction, the highest honor in the sport. Pitino is one of 12 finalists, with enshrinement in Springfield, Massachusetts, on September 8. Monday: Lead the Cardinals to their first national championship since 1986 -- and, in the process, become the first coach to win a title at two programs. He led the Kentucky Wildcats to the 1996 title. This scenario is possible for Pitino, whose top-seeded Cardinals play 12th-seeded Oregon in the Sweet 16 on Friday in Indianapolis. A win against the Ducks, followed by a victory against either Duke or Michigan State, and Pitino might have the most incredible Final Four weekend for a coach in history. Not that he is willing to consider this possibility now. Pitino didn't become one of the most successful coaches of his generation -- with 660 victories at the college level and another 192 in the NBA -- by looking ahead. ""Not for two seconds,"" he said with a smile Thursday when asked about the potential for that weekend in Atlanta. ""Until you brought it up, I didn't even know it was being voted on."" The hall selection is voted on by a committee. The basketball, of course, is played for the world to see. With the way his team has played over the past seven weeks, the Cardinals have emerged as the clear favorite in what was the most wide-open college basketball season in years. Bleacher Report: Rick Pitino: College Basketball Icon . Since a 104-101 loss at Notre Dame on February 9 -- an epic five-overtime thriller that ranks among the best games of the season -- Louisville has won 12 straight games. Only one of those, a 58-53 win over a Syracuse team then ranked 12th in the nation, was decided by single digits. Pitino would never classify this Louisville team as his best, not when he regularly filled NBA rosters while coaching the other half of this bluegrass blood rivalry at Kentucky. But few teams have bought into his philosophy better than this one, with a relentless pressing defense and unselfish offense built around the 3-point line. Let the most recent victim explain: ""I don't want to put any pressure on Rick and his guys, but they're special,"" Larry Eustachy said after his Colorado State team suffered an 82-56 loss in the third round. ""They need a little luck like everybody does to win it all ... but I can't say enough about coach Pitino and how he gets his guys to play for 40 minutes as impressive as I've ever seen."" It is almost hard to believe that the still-young-looking Pitino is 60, that he is in his fourth decade as a coach. But it's been 34 years since he took his first head coaching job at Boston University, 26 years since he took his first team to the Final Four with Providence and 17 years since he clipped the nets for the first (and so far only) time as a champion at Kentucky. Louisville is his seventh stop as a head coach, and at 12 seasons so far, his longest. Pitino has taken the Cards to a pair of Final Fours, in 2005 and 2012, but has never led them to a title. This is not only his best shot, but a team that he has enjoyed coaching like few in his career. Bleacher Report: NCAA Brackets 2013: Updated Look at Road to Final Four . ""If I can keep recruiting guys like this, I want to coach until 70 and beyond, because I've had such a blast and to see guys work that hard inside just fills you up, really does,"" Pitino said. ""That's not easy to do what they do. I don't think in my best day as an athlete I could have done half of what these guys do in the course of a game. It's really amazing what they do on the court."" It starts with Pitino. Of the remaining coaches in the NCAA Tournament, he is one of six with titles on his resume, with two -- Duke's Krzyzewski and Syracuse's Jim Boeheim -- already Hall of Famers. But few have left a bigger imprint on the game than the Louisville coach. Pitino helped usher in a new era in college basketball, recognizing before most coaches that the 3-point line would radically change how the game would be played. His teams defended all 94 feet on the court, using their quickness to force turnovers and emphasizing that any open shot from behind that arc is a good one. He said it was a style he developed at Boston University, a struggling program he rebuilt, when he was a 20-something coach. ""So I could basically make all the mistakes I wanted to and no one noticed,"" he said. ""I was continuing tinkering with the full court press, changing it, working at it. For the five years at BU, I came up with a style of play that I stuck with from that point on."" Or, as his point guard Peyton Siva said, ""We can play at the YMCA, and I guarantee you Coach Pitino will still have us pressing full court."" Bleacher Report: Louisville Basketball: 5 Biggest Roadblocks to Winning 2013 NCAA Championship . The style -- and, of course, the players -- helped made him a winner at each of his college stops, and he even used it with mixed results in the NBA. When the Cardinals fell behind by 16 early in the second half to Syracuse in this Big East Tournament championship game this season, it was the press that helped turn the game around -- and, eventually, into a 17-point victory. The Cardinals are deep, talented and balanced, led by an experienced back court in Siva (9.7 points and 5.9 assists a game) and Russ Smith (18.4 points). ""From a talent standpoint (this team) may not even be in my top five,"" Pitino said. ""But in terms of execution, intensity, a will to win, it's up there. We don't play the game for the lottery (in the NBA) draft. We play the game for Louisville, and then our guys move on and they're very successful people in and out of basketball. ""I'm just having a blast. The kids are just loving, loving individuals and just great to be around."" Pitino has this team two victories away from another Final Four -- and, quite possibly, a weekend like no coach in history has ever experienced.","Louisville basketball coach Rick Pitino has 660 college-level victories and 192 with the NBA .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two women and a child were killed when militants blew themselves up in Pakistan's violence-hit Balochistan province Thursday, police said. Militants in Balochistan, a province rich in natural gas, have been fighting Pakistani military forces for self-rule. For years, they have complained that the government has paid little attention to them and their economic needs. During recent national elections, the province bordering Afghanistan saw violent attacks on voters going to polls. Bombers struck voters who had just cast their ballots as well as candidates and their supporters, and a gunfight broke out at a polling station. In addition to sectarian attacks on Shiites, unrest in the province in the country's southwest is believed to be fomented by several insurgent groups, including the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army and the Pakistani Taliban. Pakistan, which has a strong militant presence near the Afghan border and other parts of the country, has been engulfed in violence.","Militants in Balochistan have been fighting against Pakistan's military for self rule .

"(CNN) -- Former hostages held at the American Embassy in Iran are hoping the Academy Award for Best Picture for ""Argo"" boosts their efforts to be paid reparations for the ordeal. "" 'Argo' was a great motion picture; it was a great story. But it's only part of the story,"" says former hostage Steven Lauterbach. Unlike the six whose escape to the Canadian Embassy was featured in the movie, he was one of the 52 who were held for 444 days in the U.S. Embassy. He and other former hostages believe Iran has never been held accountable for the episode and should have to pay each of them restitution. ""We feel that we should be entitled to some compensation,"" he said. Lauterbach said that during his captivity, he spent four days in solitary confinement. At the end, he was so desperate that he slashed both wrists with a broken drinking glass. ""My shirt, pants, and shoes were soaked in blood,"" he said. ""I was prepared to die."" Attorney Tom Lankford, who has represented the hostages in court for years, is seeking about $4 million apiece in damages. Coming soon: Iran's response to 'Argo' ""They were beaten; they played Russian roulette with them, they stood them up against walls as if they were killing them in mock firing squads,"" he said. ""They destroyed in many cases not only their bodies, but their souls."" Lauterbach was hospitalized and survived the grueling ordeal. But even today, he said: ""I still have occasional (and sometimes not so occasional) nightmares and flashbacks. In my most common nightmare, the deal made to release us has been rescinded, and we have to go back into captivity."" Even now, he said, ""I get feelings of panic and claustrophobia sometimes. It's never really behind you."" The hostages were released in January 1981 under a set of agreements, the Algiers Accords, which stipulated that the hostages could not sue Iran for damages. But for years, many of them have sought compensation anyway, arguing that an agreement made under duress at gunpoint is not valid. CNN called and e-mailed Iran's mission to the United Nations for comment but did not receive a response. The State Department, however, has argued against breaking the agreement, saying that if the United States were to renege on the Algiers deal, the decision would call into question America's commitment to honoring all its other treaties and agreements as well. John Sheardown, Canadian 'hero' in hostage crisis, dies . ""The United States government remains deeply grateful to the former hostages for their service to their country, and expresses its sympathy for the suffering they experienced during their ordeal,"" the State Department said in a statement. ""As an essential condition of their release from captivity, however, the United States agreed in the Algiers Accords to bar claims by the former hostages against Iran from U.S. courts. Although we understand their frustration, we are bound by this commitment and must continue to honor it."" The courts have sided with the State Department, and in 2012, the Supreme Court declined to hear the hostages' appeal. Now the group is pushing Congress for an alternative. Instead of being compensated with Iranian government money, which sits in frozen accounts, they propose using money collected from fines against companies caught violating the embargo against Iran. ""Even though these fines will probably not come directly from the Iranians,"" says Lauterbach, ""I think it will to some degree right a wrong."" As part of their efforts to persuade lawmakers, the group is assembling a package of testimonials from the former hostages. One former hostage who will not be able to tell Congress his story: former CIA agent Phillip Ward, who committed suicide in October. He was beaten in his cell and subjected to mock executions during captivity, and after his release, he became a recluse and an alcoholic, according to Lankford.

"London (CNN) -- Police are investigating whether anti-Muslim sentiments were behind a fire early Wednesday that caused extensive damage to a Somali community center in north London. The fire, in the Muswell Hill neighborhood, is being treated as suspicious, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. Police told CNN that investigators will probe whether the attack may have been directed against Muslims. The letters ""EDL"" -- a possible reference to the English Defence League, a far-right group -- were found on the building, the statement said. ""Police are investigating any potential connection between the graffiti and the fire."" The force ""will work closely with the Somali and Islamic communities to provide support and reassurance,"" the statement said. The Met's Counter Terrorism Command is leading the inquiry. Emergency services were called to the fire at the Somali Bravanese Welfare Association at 3:23 a.m. Opinion: Anti-Muslim backlash in England, but not here . One woman was treated for injuries not suffered in the fire, police said. Community leaders said they and the center had co-existed peacefully for 20 years, Chief Superintendent Adrian Usher told reporters. Police will increase patrols in the area, he said. No one has been arrested. Tensions in the metropolitan area have been heightened since May 22, when a soldier, Lee Rigby, was killed in Woolwich in southeast London. Two men have been charged with murder in the case. The English Defence League has staged protest marches in London and elsewhere. The group says that Islamic law is poised to overthrow British society and calls for Britons to act aggressively to pre-empt it. Cressida Dick, assistant commissioner for the Metropolitan Police, told lawmakers Tuesday that hate crime reports rose after the Woolwich attack but had since declined. She told the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee that some ""horrible attacks on mosques"" had taken place, but she was not aware of any assaults on people. The spike in reported crimes was less than spikes that followed the 9/11 attacks in the United States and the 2005 bomb attacks on London's transport system, she added.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's Interior Ministry backtracked Tuesday on its statement that Benazir Bhutto died because she hit her head on a sunroof latch during a shooting and bomb attack. The two suspects (circled) who the Pakistan government believe were involved in Bhutto's assassination. The government also published a reward offer in several national newspapers to anyone who could identify two suspects from the killing. Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema told CNN the ministry will wait for the findings from forensic investigators before making a conclusion about her cause of death. Cheema said he based his statement Friday about the sunroof latch ""on the initial investigations and the reports by the medical doctors"" who treated her at Rawalpindi General Hospital. ""I was just narrating the facts, you know, and nothing less nothing more,"" Cheema said. ""There's no intention to conceal anything from the people of Pakistan,"" an Interior Ministry news release said. The reward offer, which appeared with photographs of the dead suspects, said that ""the person identifying these terrorists will be awarded a cash prize of 5 million rupees (about $81,400) and his identity will also be kept confidential""  -- a total reward available of 10 million. ""The response from the public has been nil so far,"" Punjab spokesman Ashfaq Gondal said Tuesday afternoon. Athar Minallah, a lawyer on the board that manages Rawalpindi General Hospital, told CNN Monday that doctors did not make the statements attributed to them by the government. The medical report -- obtained by CNN from Minallah -- made no mention of the sunroof latch and listed the cause of death as ""Open head injury with depressed skull fracture, leading to Cardiopulmonary arrest."" Read Bhutto's full medical report . Pakistan's Interior Ministry said Thursday it was from a bullet or shrapnel wound, but then it announced a day later that Bhutto died from a skull fracture suffered when she fell or ducked into the car as a result of the shots or the explosion and crashed her head into a sunroof latch. Bhutto's family and political party maintain that the government is lying, and insist she died from gunshot wounds. Several videos show a gunman firing a pistol toward her just moments before a bomb detonated nearby as she left a rally. The U-turn on the sunroof claims will only heighten speculation as to the exact cause of Bhutto's death. Minallah issued an open letter Monday and released the doctors' clinical notes to distance them from the government statement. In the letter, Minallah said the doctors ""suggested to the officials to perform an autopsy,"" but that Saud ""did not agree."" He noted that under the law, police investigators have ""exclusive responsibility"" in deciding to have an autopsy. Minallah told CNN that he was speaking out because the doctors at the hospital were ""threatened."" ""They are government servants who cannot speak; I am not,"" he said. He did not elaborate on the threats against the doctors. He said the lack of an autopsy has created ""a perception that there is some kind of cover-up, though I might not believe in that theory."" ""There is a state within the state, and that state within the state does not want itself to be held accountable,"" Minallah said. The three-page medical report, which was signed by seven doctors, described Bhutto's head wound, but it did not conclude what caused it. It noted that X-ray images were made after she was declared dead. The wound was described as an irregular oval of about 5 centimeters by 3 centimeters above her right ear. ""Sharp bones edges were felt in the wound,"" it read. ""No foreign body was felt in the wound."" Rawalpindi's police chief was accused Monday of stopping doctors at the hospital where Bhutto died from conducting an autopsy. It was a violation of Pakistani criminal law and prevented a medical conclusion about what killed the former prime minister, said Minallah. However, the police chief involved, Aziz Saud, told CNN that he suggested an autopsy be done -- but that Bhutto's husband objected. Cheema said the government had no objection to Bhutto's body being exhumed for an autopsy if the family requested it. Her widower,Asif Ali Zardari, has said the family was against exhumation because it did not trust the government. Minallah said the family could not have prevented an autopsy at the hospital without getting an order from a judge. The revelations about the exact cause of Bhutto's death came after new videotape of her assassination emerged, showing her slumping just after gunshots rang out. The tape provided the clearest view yet of the attack and appeared to show that Bhutto was shot. That would contradict the Pakistan government's account. A previously released videotape showed a man at the right of her vehicle raising a gun, pointing it toward Bhutto, who was standing in her car with her upper body through the sunroof. He fired three shots, then there was an explosion. In the video that emerged on Sunday, Bhutto was standing, and her hair and scarf appeared to move, perhaps from the bullet.

"Monmouth, Oregon (CNN) -- Images of destroyed homes, people sleeping in the streets and broken freeways reveal the recent tragedy of Chile. Who would think that after the horror of Port-au-Prince, restless geological plates would so quickly wreak havoc in another nation? The Earth seems at war with itself. But, as many have observed, Chile is not Haiti. Chile's economy is one of the fastest-growing in Latin America. This earthquake will do little to slow down that down. In Santiago, dominated by industries, corporate offices and financial institutions, most people will return to work within a week. But there is another side of Chile for which the picture cannot be as optimistic: the depressed areas that have never enjoyed the nation's economic boom. These are ""callampas,"" or impoverished wards of major cities and small towns that have been bypassed by progress. Unfortunately, the earthquake has hit these areas the hardest. The question is now, how will the government address these people's need for housing and employment? In stark contrast to the coast, inland from the quake's epicenter are some of the finest vineyards in the country. They were spared by the tsunami that destroyed some coastal towns, and although they sustained some damage from the quake, their grapes will soon be on our tables to join the avocados and berries that Chile shares with the Northern Hemisphere. In recent decades, the country has also become a major exporter of forest products. Tree plantations and pulp factories are situated within a hundred-mile radius of the quake's epicenter; mills will return to production soon. Farm-raised fish are harvested farther south, and these exports will likewise continue. And Chile's most important export continues to be copper and other minerals. The majority of these mines are in the northern desert, out of range of the quake's damage. When copper prices reached all-time highs earlier in the decade, Chile created a multibillion-dollar ""rainy day"" fund, which it will now draw on to rebuild the country. But now the country's greatest challenge will probably not be economic recovery; rather, it will be social recovery. Why? The globalization model followed by Chile's University of Chicago-trained economists is largely responsible for the nation's affluence. These economists began as university professors, but under Gen. Augusto Pinochet, they designed the key policies of trade, investment and employment. While this model promoted growth, it held down wages and benefits, which prevented many working-class people from benefiting from the country's bonanza. The export-oriented economy did not create many higher-paid manufacturing jobs. Unskilled, low-paying jobs predominated. The people employed in these positions are the most affected by the quake. In Santiago, they occupy many of the older buildings in the hard-hit core of the city. On the coast near the epicenter, they live in the humble dwellings flooded or washed away by the tsunami. Under Chile's globalization model, some inefficient coal mines in the Concepción area closed in the 1990s when they could no longer compete with higher-grade, cheaper coal from Colombia. The same occurred with the area's textile mills. As a result, unemployment is higher in the quake area than in the country as a whole, a situation that promises to worsen in the aftermath. Since democracy returned to Chile in 1990, a coalition of center-left parties has governed the nation. Although it has addressed social issues and sharply reduced the nation's poverty rate, the booming economy, ""which raises all boats,"" has yet to get theirs off the beach. For many, the tsunami sank their boat. President-elect Sebastián Piñera, who takes office March 11, is the first moderate-conservative in two decades to govern Chile. Ideologically, he opposes an activist state, which addresses poverty as an issue separate from general economic prosperity. His first public statement after the quake called for public order and an end to vandalism. He also urged repairing water and energy services. Once in office, he will need to rebuild freeways, bridges and public buildings as quickly as possible. This will create many jobs. But Piñera, an advocate of privatization, has spoken of no plans to modify globalization policies: a plan to lift those boats. Chilean leaders have a mixed record in rebuilding after severe quakes; effected areas rarely recovered well. In 1906, the country's main port of Valparaiso suffered a devastating quake only four months after San Francisco was almost destroyed. The rebuilding was slow as the country's economic center definitively shifted from the port inland to Santiago. When a severe quake hit in 1939, the Popular Front government created a new business-government economic model to address the crisis. In 1960, the largest quake in world history decimated the picturesque port of Valdivia. Buildings sank, and rural grazing land turned into lakes. The conservative government borrowed heavily abroad and tried a number of fiscal innovations to get the country on its feet. Past governments rebuilt Valparaiso and Valdivia, but the cities never regained their former leadership roles. The recent Concepcion quake hit Chile's second-largest industrial city. As the government rebuilds it, and the city attempts to regain its prominence, Piñera must carefully weigh how his privatization model will help those most affected by this tragedy. The people in depressed communities need jobs, housing and education. Chile will continue to provide economic leadership in the hemisphere, but in addressing this current tragedy, can the nation provide social leadership as well? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Rector.","John Rector says that unlike Haiti, Chile can rebuild on strong economy .
But existing problems of low-wage jobs, unemployment now made worse, he says .
Incoming president must modify globalization goals, focus on social problems, he says .

"(CNN) -- Lonesome George, the last surviving Pinta Island giant tortoise, has died at his home in the Galapagos Islands. Scientists believe he was more than 100 years old. Staff at the Galapagos National Park in Ecuador say George, the only remaining member of his subspecies (Chelonoidis abingdoni), was found dead by his long-term keeper, Fausto Llerena. In a statement the national park said Llerena had been ""unhappily surprised"" to discover his charge ""stretched out in the direction of his watering hole with no signs of life,"" on Sunday morning. A post-mortem examination will be carried out to ascertain the cause of death, as although he was old by human standards, Lonesome George was not considered old for a giant tortoise -- the animals can live to around 200 years of age. Photos: A study of mass extinction . George became a symbol of the Galapagos Islands after he was found on Pinta Island by biologist Joseph Vagvolgyi in 1971. His plight as the only known member of his subspecies led to a series of ill-fated attempts to provide him with a mate. But despite the best efforts of conservationists -- and the presence of two female giant tortoises from a close subspecies sharing his enclosure at the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz -- George remained a solitary creature. His death marks the end of the purebred Pinta Island tortoise, but there is hope that they will survive in some form: at least one first-generation descendant of the subspecies has been found at the Wolf volcano on neighboring Isabela Island. Genetic testing has been carried out to try to find further hybrids among the population there. The giant tortoises of the Galapagos helped Charles Darwin formulate his theory of evolution after he visited the islands in the 1830s, on his five year voyage aboard HMS Beagle. At the time, the super-sized reptiles were common, but the introduction of wild goats, which ate the vegetation that formed their diet, and the hunting habits of passing sailors -- left them on the brink of extinction.","Giant tortoise Lonesome George dies in Galapagos Islands .

"London (CNN) -- An English-language magazine in Dubai has been accused of disrespecting Islam by recommending places to drink during Ramadan. Time Out Dubai, a popular city guide in the Emirate, published the offending article in its Ramadan issue, which promised to help readers ""make the most of the Holy Month."" The story, headlined ""5 to try: bars in Ramadan,"" listed bars in the city that were remaining open throughout Ramadan, giving their hours of operation. During Ramadan, a month in the Islamic calendar for fasting and piety, Muslims abstain from eating, drinking, smoking and sex from dawn to dusk, and prohibitions against behaviors considered sinful, such as drinking alcohol, are more keenly observed. After the magazine tweeted a link to an online version of the article, it was circulated by influential Emirati users of the social media site, prompting an online campaign using the #stoptimeoutdubai hashtag. The backlash highlighted cultural tensions that exist between the mainly Muslim Emiratis, who make up 17% of Dubai's population, and the foreigners who have become part of the country's make-up as it has modernized into a global hub. Read also: Saudi women slam dunk sports taboo . One Twitter user said the article showed ""how some people who (live) here have no respect to the culture and the people at all,"" while another said his culture was being ""perverted by alcoholics,"" and tweeted at the magazine to ""keep your filth away."" Some Westerners living in the UAE responded that the outrage was an overreaction. The magazine apologized, saying it respected ""local culture and traditions"" and claiming the article, which was removed from the site, was an ""error of judgment on our part."" But the apology was not enough to appease some users, who continued to call for staff at the magazine to be fired. Mahra Al Shamsi, an Emirati English teacher living in Ras Al Khaimah, described the article as shocking. ""Have they lost their marbles? Do they not remember that, even though this magazine is targeted for expats, they are living in the United Arab Emirates -- an Arab country with very strong Islamic values and beliefs."" Al Shamsi said that Emiratis respected foreign customs when abroad. ""Is this the thanks we get? Frankly, this should be mutual."" But Fiona Du Vivier, a Scottish account manager who has lived in Dubai for nearly two years, thought the campaign was a ""huge overreaction"" to an article that, while perhaps poorly judged, was not disrespectful or insulting. Read also: Lebanon's burning tires become sign of peace . ""We are in one of the few countries in the world where you have to curtail your behavior whether you're participating in Ramadan or not, out of respect,"" she said. ""Which is fair enough, I chose to live in this country and I choose to respectfully follow its customs."" ""Having said that,"" she said, ""there's a huge proportion of the country that do not participate in Ramadan. The article was merely pointing to a facility that's available for non-fasting Muslims and non-Muslims. When it was pointed out it could be taken as disrespectful, they took it down and apologized."" She said some of the angry tweets she had seen -- that the journalist should burn in hell, or threatening to assault anyone drinking during the holy month -- were ""not in the spirit of Ramadan itself, which is about forgiveness and compassion."" Al Shamsi said while the article may have been pointing out something factual, the linkage of the concept of drinking with Ramadan was offensive. ""The disrespectful bit comes in when they rub it in your face. This is like going to a poor country and writing an article about luxury ... It's not appropriate."" Read also: Saving Luke Skywalker's Tunisian ranch . Omar Abu Omar, a Dubai-based social media marketer, said while the article was not offensive, as bar and entertainment options were the magazine's standard fare, the timing was inappropriate. More than anything though, he said, it highlighted the potential pitfalls of social media. ""In my opinion, they made a mistake of sharing it on their Twitter feed, as it would have gone unnoticed otherwise,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Baseball writers balked at naming any new players to the sport's Hall of Fame on Wednesday, with none of the 37 eligible players drawing enough votes for a ticket to Cooperstown. The 2013 ballot marked the first year of eligibility for several players who have been named in the probes of performance-enhancing drug use in the major leagues, including all-time home run champ Barry Bonds and seven-time Cy Young winner Roger Clemens. It's only the eighth time that no player received the 75% support needed to enter the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and several of the voters said the results reflected the Baseball Writers Association of America's ambivalence about the sport's ""steroid era."" ""This is really a statement on an era, and it's really a sad day for baseball,"" BBWAA voter Jon Heyman told the sport's in-house MLB Network. Heyman said he expected the writers who choose hall members would ""basically split"" on Bonds and Clemens, ""and we're not split. It was two-thirds to one-third against."" The concerns about players who were linked to steroids ""has hurt some of the clean guys"" as well, Heyman said. The head of the players' union, Michael Weiner, said the decision was unfair. ""To ignore the historic accomplishments of Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, for example, is hard to justify,"" he said. ""Moreover, to penalize players exonerated in legal proceedings, and others never even implicated, is simply unfair. The Hall of Fame is supposed to be for the best players to have ever played the game."" Longtime Sports Illustrated baseball writer Tom Verducci said it wouldn't matter if a player was a Hall of Fame caliber player before baseball had its steroid use problems. ""Based on your career win totals or home run totals, that doesn't give you the green light then to go ahead and cheat the game and those who played it, (making it) an unfair game."" The top vote-getter on the 2013 ballot was longtime Houston Astros second baseman Craig Biggio, who racked up more than 3,000 hits in a two-decade career. Biggio received 68% of the vote, falling 39 votes short of election, Hall of Fame President Jeff Idelson announced. Clemens has denied using performance-enhancing drugs, and in 2012, a federal jury acquitted him of lying to Congress during an investigation of steroid use. Bonds, who topped Hank Aaron's home run mark in 2007, was sentenced to two years of probation and 30 days of house arrest for obstruction of justice in another federal probe; he also has denied using performance-enhancing drugs. Other players on the ballot who were linked to the use of performance-enhancing drugs over the past two decades included Mark McGwire, the St. Louis Cardinals slugger who broke the sport's single-season home run record in 1998; the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa, McGwire's major rival in that season-long chase; and four-time All-Star Rafael Palmeiro. In 2010, McGwire admitted to using steroids during his record-breaking season. Palmeiro was once slapped with a suspension after a positive drug test but denied using any banned substances. Sosa denied using steroids during a congressional hearing but did not respond to requests for an interview by staffers for former Sen. George Mitchell, who led a probe of steroid use in the major leagues in 2007. Fans' reactions were mixed. ""I think it's utter nonsense,"" said Darin McAuliffe, an Atlanta IT consultant. ""I think if you're going to be paid tens of millions of dollars a year, you're going to do what you need to do to stay at the top of your game. And the average Joe gets that. And their owners demand that."" Opinion: Going after Clemens was stupid . But Carl Bauer, who commented on the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Facebook page, said the voters got it right. ""I think people confuse the Hall of Fame and Museum with getting a plaque from the Baseball Writers (Association) of America,"" he wrote. ""All the steroid cheaters (specifically Bonds, Clemens, McGwire, Sosa and Palmeiro, etc.) have their accomplishments represented in the Hall of Fame. So the history of baseball, and their history in baseball, is represented. However, we do not need to honor these cheaters and lawbreakers with a plaque."" Matt Roe, a Cardinals fan who was hanging out at The Post Sports Bar and Grill in Maplewood, Missouri, said he thought some of those on the ballot were punished for the supposed actions of another. ""The fact that nobody got inducted is kind of like the sports writers were making a point out of Barry Bonds,"" he said. Like Bonds and Clemens, Sosa was in his first year of eligibility for the Hall of Fame. McGwire was on the ballot for a seventh time and Palmeiro, a third. Opinion: Allow doping in sport . Former pitcher Jack Morris received 67.7% of the vote. Morris, who won 254 games in his career, gets one more crack next year, as players are eligible for 15 ballots, beginning five years after they retire. One of the players who won't be on next year's ballot is Dale Murphy, a two-time Most Valuable Player who spent most of his career with the Atlanta Braves. The fact that no one was voted in this year could muddle the ballot for 2014, when pitchers Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux will be added to the ballot, as will slugger Frank Thomas. Three people will be inducted into the Hall of Fame on July 28. In December a special panel that looks at people whose career ended before 1947 voted in Jacob Ruppert, the New York Yankees owner who bought Babe Ruth's contract in 1919; former umpire Hank O'Day; and Deacon White, a catcher in the 19th century.

"(CNN) -- Fine Arabic calligraphy and street art may seem worlds apart, but for artist eL Seed, they're one and the same thing. eL Seed, a 31-year-old French Tunisian artist, has just used his distinctive style of Arabic street art, which he calls ""calligraffiti,"" to decorate the tallest minaret in Tunisia with a verse from the Quran that tackles intolerance. The mural, on the Jara Mosque in eL Seed's hometown of Gabes is 47 meters tall, 10 meters wide and covers two sides of the minaret, his biggest artwork to date. eL Seed said he was reacting to clashes between hardline Islamist Salafists and artists at an art fair in Tunis in June that showed works the Salafists believed was insulting to Islam. Tunisia has experienced the resurgence of ultra-conservative Islamist groups since since the revolution that ousted president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011. eL Seed said he believed both the artists and the religious extremists were showing intolerance and he wanted to bring a message of tolerance. ""My goal was to bring people together, which is why I chose these words from the Quran,"" said eL Seed. ""I like graffiti because it brings art to everyone. I like the fact of democratizing art. ""I hope it will inspire other people to do crazy projects and not to be scared."" eL Seed, who was born and raised in France by a Tunisian family, grew up speaking Tunisian dialect. He did not learn to read or write Arabic until his late teens and discovered a renewed interest in his Tunisian roots. He began experimenting with street art both in France and Tunisia at the age of 16, and gradually increased the scale of his work. He said street art has boomed in Tunisia since the revolution. ""Street art is not new to Tunisia, but it was much more small scale before the revolution,"" he said. ""I would do a wall in a community and people in the neighborhood would come along and help me. ""In the beginning I would work when no-one was around, but as I got more well-known, people would invite me to decorate their walls."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Syrian artists fight Assad regime with satire . After the revolution in January 2011, street art was possible on a bigger scale, he said. ""Before the revolution art in Tunisia was quite bourgeois, but if you put big pieces of art on walls it is for everyone,"" said eL Seed, now living in Montreal, Canada. ""The revolution pushed people to be more creative because before they were scared -- and now they have more freedom."" Exactly a year after the start of the protests against President Ben Ali which sparked uprisings across the Arab world, eL Seed took on his first large-scale mural to celebrate Tunisia's revolution. In the city of Kairouani, he painted a giant mural with a passage from a Tunisian poem he intended as a message of hope to all those engaged in struggles against tyranny, corruption, and injustice. The wall he used had been used during the revolution to voice dissent during the revolution, he said, adding that six others spontaneously joined him to help with the mural. eL Seed wrote on his website: ""The wall on which we painted had actually been used to voice dissent and commentary throughout the protests. Folks painted freely on this wall and would discuss current opinions and the changing state of Tunisia. ""This wall, however, was painted over not long after the ousting of Ben Ali: Those revolutionary words no longer able to conjure the memories of defiance and dignity. In this sense, the mural creation became a public memorial commemorating these words and their meaning."" Also on Inside the Middle East: W hat happened to Tel Aviv's tent city? For his recent projects, eL Seed worked with a community organization Al Khaldounia, which obtained authorization for his murals. He was sponsored to do the minaret mural by Barjeel Art Foundation in the United Arab Emirates. In his earlier works, he simply asked people if he could paint on their walls. eL Seed chose his nickname as a tag for his grafitti at the age of 16 while studying a French novel ""Le Cid."" ""My teacher said 'le cid' comes from the Arabic word 'el sayed' which means 'the master, the man'. So I was 16 years old and I said to myself ' I am the master, the man' so I called myself 'eL Seed.'"" eL Seed has a solo exhibition opening at Gallery Itinerrance in Paris 13 on October 12.

"(CNN) -- These pictures were taken within one week of each other in the center of Aleppo and show the incredible resilience of some of its residents in the face of Syria's bloody civil war. Photographer Issa Touma's home in the historic area of Aleppo has been badly damaged by gunfire. Yet, amid the crossfire between opposition and government forces, Touma is still organizing the international photography festival he holds every year. Touma, who owns a gallery in Aleppo, has been running the exhibition for 11 years and was determined that the show would continue despite fighting reaching the center of the city on August 19. The festival was due to open on September 15. ""Before that time we were continuing preparations for the festival in the normal way because we didn't think the middle of the city would be affected by the war,"" said Touma. ""But life changed quickly. Shooting started to come from every direction,"" he added. Syria's largest city, in the north of the country, has become a key battleground between the rebel Free Syrian Army, which controls parts of the city, and forces loyal to President Bashar Al-Assad aiming to drive them out. Until August, the fighting was confined to the countryside surrounding the city, but has since moved closer and closer to the center. On August 27, Touma's home in a historic area of the city was badly damaged by gunfire and he says he was trapped inside for nine days while fighting raged outside. ""The Free Syrian Army's lines were in front of my house,"" he said. ""Those nine days were so terrible."" ""After nine days both sides stopped firing for a short moment to let the civilians out. ""There was no food in my fridge by then. I will never forget those nine days in all my life."" Amnesty International said in a report on August 23 that civilians had borne the brunt of air strikes, mortar and artillery attacks on residential areas, with scores of people not involved in the conflict killed and injured. The United Nations estimates that 19,000 people have been killed across Syria since the uprising began 18 months ago and that 1.2 million people -- half of them children -- have left their homes and become refugees in their own country. Also on Inside the Middle East: Tunisian artist graffitis minaret, fights intolerance . Touma is now living with his parents in the center of Aleppo and considers himself lucky. He said: ""Many people are living in the street or in the entrance of buildings, in schools, in churches, in gardens, many families are living together without much space. ""All night we can't sleep because most of the war happens at night. Sometimes the water cuts out for two or three days, sometimes electricity cuts if they are shooting the cables."" Many practical problems made organizing a photography festival a near impossibility, he added: There was no communication or internet connection in the city for almost a month, the building where the festival was due to take place was inaccessible and artworks that had been sent by artists around the world had not arrived. ""It's almost an impossible situation but we wanted to go on because if we don't go on people will lose hope,"" said Touma. So he organized a smaller scale exhibition in his own gallery -- which had not been damaged -- and 60 people attended the symbolic opening. The 870 photographs he has from 48 artists around the world will be shown gradually in a changing display in Touma's gallery, rather than all together in a large building as planned. A few other galleries in the city have also offered to show parts of the exhibition. ""People were really happy at the opening,"" said Touma. ""It's been really important for everybody."" ""It all has to change depending on the situation, nothing is certain. It all depends on which direction they are shooting in, whether we can get in touch with people to advertise."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Syrian artists fight Assad regime with satire . Touma said that many of his traditional audience had fled Syria, and instead many of the people coming to the festival had never been to a gallery or been interested in photography before. In March, he also launched a peace project called Art Camping in response to the war, which has been dividing the country since protests against Al-Assad began in March 2011. It is a series of art, music and photography workshops, often aimed at refugees or people who have never been interested in art before. ""People talk about the refugees in Jordan or Lebanon, but most refugees are inside the city,"" said Touma. ""All around Aleppo is war and more and more people are coming to the center."" ""The center is so crowded, you can't imagine how many people are living in the city."" ""When people do programs for refugees, they give them food and medicine, but not culture or anything to keep them busy. ""It's very important to everybody that there's heart in society still alive and that they still have some hope. ""These are people who have had to leave their homes, who have never been to a gallery before and now they are turning up to do art and see art. ""Now about 500 people have taken part in Art Camping. Not altogether, but different people have done different workshops.""

"London (CNN) -- Film-maker and artist Tina Gharavi grew up idolizing Muhammad Ali, the trailblazing American boxing great who was a hero to her Iranian father and millions of others around the world. ""My dad had incredible love for him,"" she told CNN at the opening of her latest exhibition, ""The Last of the Dictionary Men,"" currently on display in London's Mosaic Rooms gallery. ""It was the first time I saw a very strong black person, who was so unapologetic and beautiful."" So when she moved to South Shields -- a coastal town with a maritime heritage in northeast England -- and heard that one of the 20th century's most celebrated athletes had had his marriage blessed in an Islamic ceremony at the local mosque, she found it hard to believe. ""I said 'What?' I'd lived in the north for eight years and never heard about it. I knew I had to find out more."" Ali, she learned, had visited South Shields in 1977 with his new wife, Veronica Porsche, and their baby daughter Hana, in response to an invitation to come to the area to raise money for the Boys Club, a British charitable organization. The visit -- which drew thousands out lining the streets to watch his procession through the town -- reached its high point with a marriage blessing ceremony by the imam at the town's Al-Azhar Mosque. Intrigued by the story, Gharavi spent two years making a film -- ""The King of South Shields"" -- about Ali's unlikely visit, which led to an enduring relationship with the town's longstanding Yemeni community, whose mosque had hosted the boxer and for whom the day had provided an important validation of their sometimes tenuous place in British society. In the process of making the film, she realized that many of the elders of the South Shields Yemenis -- one of the UK's oldest Muslim and Arab communities -- were passing away, their rich stories vanishing with them. ""I was seeing something that was about to disappear and I thought this is so fascinating, I need to capture this,"" she said. ""Now their world is almost gone."" Read more: Lebanese women take on religious judges who call rape a 'marital right' She set about preserving some of that world with ""The Last of the Dictionary Men,"" which features a series of interviews with 14 of the last surviving members of the first generation of South Shields' Yemenis, recounting their experiences as migrants to the U.K., and a series of large portraits of the men by Egyptian photographer Youssef Nabil. The outsized portraits, said Gharavi, hand-colored in the style of old Egyptian movie posters, were intended to present the men ""in a way that aggrandizes them,"" in contrast to the ""social realist"" depictions that had typically been used to portray their community. ""Whenever they were shown, they'd typically be in the mosque, everything would look very miserable and a bit dirty,"" she said. ""I thought that's not who they are. They were funny, they would flirt with me and were full of life."" The name of the exhibition, she said, referred to lines written by the Yemeni poet Abdullah al-Baradduni, who wrote in 1995 that ""our land is the dictionary of our people."" The story of South Shields' Yemeni community began in the 1890s, when seamen from the British ruled Aden Protectorate -- now part of modern day Yemen -- began working on British ships, eventually finding their way to port towns in Britain. The UK's first mosque was opened in Cardiff, Wales, by Yemenis who had come to Britain as seamen. Gharavi said the Yemenis were recruited by the British as they made good sailors -- they didn't drink, and could handle the heat of the engine room furnaces well. During the First World War, the British government began encouraging Yemeni men into the country to make up for a manpower shortage brought about by the conflict. By the war's end, the Yemeni population of the northern shipping town had risen to about 3,000, and as many as 800 had been killed on merchant navy supply ships at sea. ""They were working on ships that the German were very keen to bomb, so there's an extraordinary number of Yemeni men who died,"" said Gharavi. But the new arrivals were not initially welcomed by the public at large. Discrimination meant they found it hard to find accommodation, with the seamen mostly forced to live in boarding houses -- the first of which opened in the town in 1909 -- largely isolated from the wider community. After the war, the boarding houses suffered attacks intended to drive the Arabs from the town. Perceptions of unfair treatment in the workplace led to riots in 1919 and 1930, and eventually led to the council segregating the community by building an estate to house the Yemenis. Read more: Can Iraq's geeks save the country? But by the 1940s, attitudes towards the community began to change, and Yemenis began marrying into the wider community. As part of her research, Gharavi commissioned a survey team to ask 100 people on South Shields' main street about their ancestry, and about one in four claimed some Yemeni heritage. Today, many of those South Shields locals -- who speak with the distinctive northeastern accent known as Geordie -- are returning to Yemen to reconnect with the culture of their forefathers, said Gharavi. South Shields' Arab community is often held up as an example of an immigration success story. ""The Yemeni have been incredibly dutiful to this country,"" she said. ""They've worked very hard for this country, and they love Britain very much because they know what they've gotten from here."" For his part, Saeed Mohamed Aklan Ghaleb, one of the men profiled in the exhibition, was nonplussed by the attention. ""When the people came to talk and take the picture, we didn't know this would happen,"" he said, bemused by the art crowd gathered at the exhibition's opening. He arrived in South Shields as a seaman in 1967, and returns every two years. ""It brings back memories,"" he said of the portraits, adding that he had a copy of his portrait hanging in his home. Gharavi said that in her eyes the community's humility was the reason the community had integrated into Britain so successfully. ""They go into a community and they assimilate, they adopt the rule of where they live and that's the reason the Yemeni have sort of disappeared in a sense."" It was part of the reason she thought their story should be heard. ""There is that swing at the moment in Britain -- a concern that 'These guys are invading, this is problematic.' It's not problematic. These guys have been here since 1890 and it's going fine.""","The Yemeni community of South Shields, England is one of the UK's oldest Muslim populations .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. State Department initiative that has yielded valuable intelligence by paying out large sums of money has set its sights on terror groups in North and West Africa. For the first time, the Rewards for Justice program is offering rewards for information on the leaders of three notorious groups: al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJWA); and the groups known as the Signed-in-Blood Battalion and Boko Haram. The highest sum is reserved for Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau: Up to $7 million. The group, whose name means ""Western education is forbidden,"" has referred to itself as the ""Nigerian Taliban."" It seeks to overthrow the government and replace it with a regime based on Islamic law. According to Human Rights Watch, Boko Haram has killed more than 2,800 people in its escalating campaign. In August 2011, it attacked a United Nations facility in Abuja, Nigeria, killing at least 23 people. It has also unleashed a wave of attacks on Christian churches. Also on the wanted list: $5 million for one-eyed veteran Islamist fighter Mokhtar Belmokhtar. He is the founder of the Signed-in-Blood Battalion, also known as the al-Mulathamun Battalion. The group claimed responsibility for an attack in January on a gas facility in Algeria. At least 37 hostages, including three U.S. citizens, died in the seizure of, and ensuing special forces assault on, the facility in In Amenas. The program has also posted rewards for information on leaders of AQIM and MUJWA. Initially involved in smuggling cigarettes, cars, drugs, and weapons, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has more recently engaged in attacks and in kidnappings in the Saharan region that have generated millions of dollars in ransoms. MUJWA is an AQIM offshoot, also responsible for abductions of foreigners for ransom. A track record of success . The Rewards for Justice Program pays large sums of money for information that leads to the arrest or conviction of anyone who plans, commits or attempts international terrorist acts. Earlier this year, President Barack Obama expanded the program to include payments for information about people involved in transnational organized crime or foreign nationals wanted by any international criminal tribunal for war crimes or genocide. The program has a track record of gaining actionable intelligence. Since its inception in 1984, the program has paid more than $125 million to more than 80 people who provided information that put terrorists behind bars or prevented acts of international terrorism worldwide. The program was central to the capture of Saddam Hussein's sons Odai and Qusai; Ramzi Yousef, convicted of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; and others. Under the Rewards for Justice Program, a $25 million reward was offered for information leading to the capture of Osama bin Laden.","The highest sum is reserved for Boko Haram leader .

"(CNN) -- Country music stars and fans alike honored George Jones on Thursday at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville. It was a fitting site for the late country music legend, who had been a member of the show since 1956. Stars such as Randy Travis, Brad Paisley and Tanya Tucker paid homage to Jones, who died Friday at 81, with music and heartfelt speeches. WSMonline.com, the website for the Nashville radio station that carries the Opry, and Opry.com were both down toward the beginning of the more than two-hour service, probably because of the large number of fans hoping to watch the event online. Grand Old Opry announcer Eddie Stubbs kicked off the memorial, introducing Tucker with the Imperials, who sang ""The Old Rugged Cross."" Barbara Mandrell, who sang alongside Jones on her 1981 hit ""I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool,"" took the stage to say a few words about ""the greatest singer of all time in country music."" Nobody will ever be able to fill Jones' shoes, she added. Mandrell spoke about the time she met Jones as a 13-year-old on tour, saying, ""What a joy that memory is to me."" She was followed by Kid Rock, who shared the chorus of an unfinished song he was writing for Jones: ""I may be a little slower, but I'm still 12 steps ahead of you."" ""Unfortunately, I didn't get to play that for him. So, Plan B,"" he said before launching into his song ""The Best of Me."" As former first lady Laura Bush took the stage, she thanked Jones' widow, Nancy, for giving her the opportunity to speak. ""When I was still in school, my friends and I must've put 1,000 quarters in the jukebox to listen to 'The Race Is On,' "" she said. She also recalled hearing Jones' ""White Lightning"" blaring from the White House gym as ""George W. worked out on the treadmill listening to George J."" ""In American music, George was truly a legend beyond compare,"" she said. ""We see that in the wonderful musical talent that's gathered here to honor George and celebrate his life. ... Today, we're left with the gift of his songs on Earth, and we can only imagine how beautiful the heavens now sound."" Paisley, who sang ""Me and Jesus,"" encouraged those who might be less familiar with Jones' work to buy his albums so they could see ""what all this ruckus is about."" Jones' close friend and protege Alan Jackson was the last to perform, singing Jones' 1980 classic ""He Stopped Loving Her Today.""","Stars and fans honored George Jones on Thursday at the Grand Ole Opry House .

"Bur Gabo, Somalia (CNN) -- We had tried for weeks to get access to Kenya's incursion into lawless Somalia. The go finally came from the Kenyan military in a text message late one Saturday night. We're told to be at the Nairobi's military airbase before dawn. ""Bring our own flak jackets,"" we were told. In October, the Kenya defense forces surprised many by sweeping into Somalia to take on Al Shabaab, an Islamic militant group bent on overthrowing the weak transitional government. At first, the ""spin"" by generals and politicians was that it was a swift reaction to punish Al Shabaab for its suspected involvement in a series of kidnappings. But peering through the window of a rattling Mi-8 transport chopper, it is clear that what soldiers and security analysts have been telling us is true. The combat base on the Kenyan side of the border is well established -- an area of cleared ground dotted with orderly rows of tents and military hardware -- including artillery pieces. It's obvious the soldiers here have have been preparing for some time. This is no rescue posse thrown together. Kenya aims to obliterate Al Shabaab. ""The reason for this campaign is to liberate the locals here from the rule of the Al Shabaab,"" Major Seif Said Rashid tells me, several magazines of ammo in his front pockets. ""My troops are committed and they are out ready to sacrifice so that they are able to achieve the objective that has brought us here."" The major says his biggest military challenge is that Al Shabaab's weakness is its strength. Militarily they couldn't match Kenya's firepower. But their small and mobile forces know the territory and terror. ""The war here is a blend of both conventional and asymmetrical,"" he says, ""and that poses some peculiar challenges."" Not that the thrust of this front is being spearheaded by truly conventional forces. We are traveling with the 20th Parachute battalion -- an elite and sometimes-controversial group -- within the Kenyan army. With them are Somali militia and forces of the transitional government. Their uniforms are a bit more tatty -- but their firepower no less impressive. We drive into Somalia in Hummers and Armored Personnel Carriers-no passport control necessary. A maxim in Somalia, though, is that armies come and go. Skill and training often has little to do with it. The American military came and went in the 1990s (remember the film ""Black Hawk Down""), U.N. peacekeeping forces made a hasty exit, Ethiopian ground forces took the capital and then left it, and Ugandan and Burundian soldiers have been fighting tooth and nail for Mogadishu for years. The Kenyan and Somali commanders on the front are very aware of their predicament. Winning the hearts and minds of the population will be a crucial step. But at the southern front line near Bur Gabo, a village perched right on the Indian Ocean, the elders say that it's gotten worse since the war came to their village. The charcoal trade has been suspended and fishing is discouraged by the military. There is little to put food on the table, they say. It would seem that speed is important, and Somali commanders say they hope to strike across the line ""within a week."" At the very front of the front line, a Kenyan paratrooper sits atop a Somali Technical (an SUV with a anti-aircraft gun bolted to the back). He peers across the river that marks the border between their territory and Al-Shabaab's. The soldiers say they are ready to go.","Kenyan forces have entered Somalia with the aim of taking on Al Shabaab .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A Japanese court on Tuesday found a 19-year-old American man guilty of murdering an Irish student in a Tokyo hotel room last year. The Tokyo District Court recommended that Richard Hinds, a musician, serve no fewer than five years and no more than 10 years in prison. The sentence was the heaviest that could be handed down to Hinds, whose age makes him a juvenile under Japanese law. Judge Masaharu Ashizawa said the evidence showed that Hinds had strangled Nicola Furlong, the 21-year-old Irish woman, with murderous intent in May 2012. Ashizawa said Hinds appeared to have used a towel or something similar to carry out the act, discounting the defense's argument that the victim had died from acute alcohol poisoning. Furlong had been studying in Tokyo on an exchange program when she met Hinds. Her parents and sister were in court Tuesday to hear the verdict read out. ""We still don't know the truth of what happened in that room, but we know Nicola did nothing wrong,"" Furlong's mother, Angela, said afterward. The victim's sister, Andrea, expressed disgust about the sentence that Hinds received, saying she didn't feel that the family got justice. ""I'm so angry and I'm so hurt,"" she said. After Furlong's death last year, her parish priest, the Rev. Jim Fitzpatrick, described her as an ""outgoing, bubbly sort of girl and very well liked."" Hinds' parents were also in court for the verdict Tuesday. Another American man, James Blackston, 23, was found guilty last week of sexually assaulting Furlong's friend on the night the Irish woman died. 2 Americans arrested after death of Irish woman . A court sentenced Blackston, a dancer from the Los Angeles area, to three years in prison.","NEW: The victim's sister says she doesn't feel the family got justice .

"(CNN) -- A wave of violence struck Iraq on Tuesday, with bomb blasts and gun battles killing at least six people and wounding more than 20, police officials told CNN. It's the latest violence to strike Iraq, where nearly 200 people have been killed and hundreds more wounded in bomb blasts and gunfights across the country since April 23. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the attacks, nor was it clear whether they were related. Among the attacks was a bomb blast at a coffee shop in Muqdadiyah, north of Baghdad, that killed one person and wounded nine, a police official said. In Baghdad, roadside bombs killed three people and wounded six, a police official said. Gunmen also reportedly killed an anti-government demonstration organizer in Haditha, while a Ministry of Industry employee was gunned down in northern Baghdad, officials said. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","A bomb blast at a coffee shop north of Baghdad kills one, wounds nine, police say .

"(The Frisky) -- A really bad gift can be a sign that your relationship is headed over a cliff, columnist says. Have you seen that Target commercial where the guy gives his date a beautiful necklace, only to have the woman look kind of uncomfortable and announce that she didn't think they were quite ""there"" yet? After a flash of hurt crosses his face, he zings back that he bought it at Target so it was super cheap. I always high-five that guy in my head, but truth is, I've been an ungrateful giftee in the past. However, it's also the truth that I've received a lot of crappy gifts. Some were heartfelt, others were just dumb. So in light of the fact that we're in primo gift-exchange season, I put together some guidelines for how to handle the gifts you get that you really wish you hadn't... Too utilitarian . I thought only married ladies woke up to things like vacuum cleaners or shower squeegees under their tree. Not so. A yoga instructor I know received a Dustbuster from her live-in boyfriend, while singer/songwriter Peg had a beau who gifted her with an oven mitt. ""I should've yelled,"" she recalls. ""I think I just had a stunned, very disappointed look on my face. Not sure what he was trying to say, but clearly we were nearing an end."" How to handle: Generally, I'm of the mind that you should try to smile and eke out a thank you, no matter what. But when someone -- particularly a live-in partner -- gives you something designed to make cooking for or cleaning up after them a little easier . . . well, no. Just no. The Frisky: When a bad gift reveals an even worse relationship . Wrong size . You have to have a little sympathy for the dude brave (or foolhardy) enough to buy you clothes. Even if he has your style down, most men are clueless with women's sizes. Searching your closet isn't much help either as one designer's ""M"" is another's ""XL,"" so he's screwed either way. If he buys something too small, then you have a gift that doesn't fit and makes you feel fat. If he buys something too large, you'll be convinced he thinks you're a chubster. How to handle: Don't take it personally. Politely tell him that while you love the dress/sweater/chaps, it's not your size and you're going to exchange it for something that'll allow you to exhale. The Frisky: My boyfriend doesn't like my hairy legs! Utterly clueless . ""Our first Christmas together, my ex bought me all action figures, from sports and horror movies,"" shares my friend, Jennifer. ""One was a bobblehead!"" Jennifer's now-ex had never been in a serious relationship before, so he wasn't being cruel with the bobblehead, just clueless. How to handle: Jennifer knew better the next year. ""Develop specific lists of things you want on Etsy, Amazon, wherever,"" she advises. ""And let him choose from a list of things you already know you like. Because sorry -- if you want to be surprised, you most surely will be."" And not in a good way. The Frisky: The 5 lies women tell themselves . I'm not her . I still remember the unspeakably ugly, donut-shaped, skull-adorned, pleather purse my man bought me one year. It was so off. So utterly not me. But perfect for his ex -- a much younger goth chick. With a forced smile I told him it seemed that he was shopping for the ghost of relationships past. How to handle: Calmly explain that while she was Kmart, you are Bloomingdale's and he has to shop accordingly. Men tend to think women all want the same things, so if he spent years getting used to gifting a one way, there might be a period of adjustment while he resets. The message . You can learn a lot about a relationship from the gifts you exchange. ""The last Christmas we were together I gave him a suitcase, and he gave me a set of knives,"" says an editor I interviewed. The two split up by mid-January. My message gift was a cheapo, faux turquoise, Santa Fe-style, silver-plated bracelet that an ex picked out with help from the girl he was cheating on me with. Ouchie. How to handle: You got the gift, don't wait for the engraved announcement -- get out. The Frisky: 9 inexcusable excuses for breaking up .","'Tis the time of the year when some really bad gifts can be delivered .
It's always bad for live-in partner to gift something to make it easier to clean up after them .
Boyfriends can be clueless, so develop lists of favorites on Etsy or Amazon .
Totally thoughtless gifts may be sign that your relationship is about to end ."
"(CNN) -- A 27-year-old Tunisian man who set himself on fire to protest unemployment has died, officials said Wednesday. Adel Khodri succumbed to his wounds early Wednesday morning, a day after he set himself ablaze, Tunisia's national civil protection and defense authorities said. His fate parallels the iconic death of Mohamed Bouazizi, a street vendor who set himself on fire in December 2010. Bouazizi's death was widely credited for spurring Arab Spring uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East. The fruit vendor's fatal protest unleashed a wave of regional dissent against oppression, government corruption and stifled freedoms. Self-immolation has since become more common in the Arab world, with people setting themselves on fire in Tunisia, Jordan, Bahrain and Morocco. Although Tunisia has toppled a longtime ruler and held historic elections since Bouazizi's death, the country is still mired in  political unrest. Khodri died the same day Tunisia's National Constituent Assembly is set to vote on a new government. In a speech before Wednesday's vote, Prime Minster-designate Ali Larayedh explained a series of proposals for the new government, the country's official news agency TAP said. Larayedh vowed to protect against excessive inflation, develop the economy, fight crime and boost development.","The self-immolation of Adel Khodri, 27, is similar to that of Mohamed Bouazizi .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton delivered the first of a series of lectures on public service at his alma mater, Georgetown University. When questioned by a student on the failure of the legislation on gun background check in the Senate, Clinton spoke in parables. ""You know that old story about, the problem with a cat that sits on a hot stove is that cat will never sit on a hot stove again, but also it will never sit on a cold stove. I think this is a cold stove,"" Clinton mused. Like most parables, the message was clear. For the past 30 years, the NRA has bought many elections with massive spending and grass-roots campaigns. No candidate who has ever been scorched on the NRA's stove wants to get burned again, so they cower in the corner. Politicians quake in fear whenever CEO Wayne LaPierre threatens hellfire and brimstone upon any apostate with the temerity to question the NRA's gospel of the gun. But America is finally fed up. New surveys by Public Policy Polling and Quinnipiac University confirm Clinton's view that the public has cooled to the NRA. Several senators who voted against background checks have taken hits in their approval ratings. From February to April, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski's overall approval rating dropped 8%. In Ohio, Sen. Rob Portman's rating went down 9% since October. And Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada saw his rating go down 3% since October/November. Alarmingly, for the NRA, this show of disapproval is happening in red states that should be gun rights strongholds. Being on the wrong side of history can be painful. Today's more tea-flavored GOP politicians find themselves badly positioned on guns. Their ideological rigidity on immigration reform, marriage equality, reproductive rights, Wall Street reform and numerous other hot-button issues is unpopular. When you factor in the outrage over gun violence, Republicans -- who seem inextricably bound to the NRA in the public's mind -- are under the gun. This week, in a town hall meeting, New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who voted down background checks, was confronted by the new political reality up close and personal. Erica Lafferty, whose mother, Dawn Hochsprung, was the principal at Sandy Hook and among the first to be gunned down, asked Ayotte, ""You had mentioned that day the burden on owners of gun stores that the expanded background checks would harm. I am just wondering why the burden of my mother being gunned down in the halls of her elementary school isn't more important than that."" Ayotte defended her vote. But questions like the one Lafferty asked won't go away. We will see how the gun issue plays out on the national stage in the coming months. If senators lose support because they refuse to give way to some gun control regulations, we may see some changes of heart. This has certainly been the case in the debate over immigration reform. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has promised to bring the matter to the floor again in light of the popular support for immigration reform. It's possible that we may even see a background check bill come back to the Senate later in the year. Of course, the gerrymandered House is quite another matter. So finally, the heat may be on the NRA for a change. And for the senators who voted against background checks, it looks like they've jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire. As usual, Bill Clinton saw it coming. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joe McLean.","Joe McLean: The NRA has bought many elections with massive spending .
McLean: But Americans are finally fed up and seem to be cooling toward the NRA .
He says some senators who voted down background checks saw a hit in approval ratings .

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Maria Sharapova predicted a bright future for Sloane Stephens despite beating the American in straight sets on Monday to reach the quarterfinals of the French Open. The world No. 2 overcame windy conditions to beat the 17th seed 6-4 6-3 and earn a last eight clash with Serbia's Jelena Jankovic. ""I think Sloane has a tremendous amount of potential and she has a lot of things in her game in which there is a lot of room for even more improvement,"" the Russian told reporters after the match. ""There are some players you play against and you're not quite sure if they will be able to develop something to a different level, but I think she will. ""She has a big game already - big strokes, pretty good serve. She has a lot of time to develop. If she's in the right hands at the right time, I'm sure she's going to have a great career."" Stephens, who turned 20 in March, was in the second week of a grand slam for only the third time, having eclipsed her fourth round appearance in Paris last year when reaching the semifinals of the Australian Open in January. ""There's always room for improvement,"" the American said on Monday. ""Maria's obviously a really great competitor if she's No.2 in the world, so it's tough. You've just got to keep improving. ""I wouldn't say there's a drastic difference - you just have to keep getting better. Some things I can improve on, so I'll do that. Overall I've done pretty well, though."" ""I enjoyed myself here at Roland Garros this year."" Next up for Sharapova is Jankovic, with the 18th seed defeating Jamie Hampton 6-0 6-2, and although the Russian leads their meetings 7-1 the pair have yet to meet on clay. ""We know each other quite well,"" Sharapova said. ""We played against each other quite a bit in the juniors all the time. We spent a lot of time together."" ""I think the clay really suits her game. She's a great retriever and gets a lot of balls back. She's playing much more consistent I believe than she's done in the last couple of years, which is nice to see, because she was at that level and maintained that level for quite a bit of time. ""She's a really tough opponent. I look forward to it."" Earlier in the day, third seed Victoria Azarenka enjoyed a similarly routine victory as the double Australian Open champion beat Francesca Schiavone 6-3 6-0. The Belarus star next faces former doubles partner Maria Kirilenko after the Russian 12th seed reached the quarterfinals for the first time with a 7-5 6-4 win over world number 66 Bethanie Mattek-Sands of the United States. ""I've played Maria a lot of times. I think the last time was the Olympics,"" said Azarenka, who took a bronze medal from their London 2012 encounter. ""She's definitely improved a lot over the last couple years since she's a very motivated player (and a) good friend of mine, also."" The most notable result for Azarenka and Kirilenko as doubles partners was at the 2011 Australian Open, where they finished runners-up. Kirilenko, who trails her friend 3-2 from their previous meetings, has never reached the semifinals of a grand slam. In the opening quarterfinals on Tuesday, Serena Williams takes on 2009 French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova while fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska continues her bid for a first grand slam when facing last year's Roland Garros runner-up, Sara Errani.","Defending champion Maria Sharapova eases into quarters against Sloane Stephens .

"(CNN) -- After a typo-related delay, legislation was signed by President Barack Obama Tuesday to end budget-related FAA air traffic controller furloughs that caused widespread travel delays last week. Despite the holdup on the president's signature, the fix went into effect over the weekend. An ""s"" missing from the word ""accounts"" was to blame, a congressional source told CNN. The bill gives the FAA permission to move money from other accounts that allows it to stop furloughing controllers. But the way the Senate version of the bill read, it would have limited the source of funds to an ""account."" The Senate bill has since been fixed. The FAA issued a statement Saturday saying that it had suspended all employee furloughs and expected normal operations to resume Sunday evening. In rare bipartisan accord, U.S. lawmakers passed the measure Friday, capping a major congressional initiative as delays snarled traffic at airports. The measure gives the Transportation Department budget planners new flexibility for dealing with forced spending cuts. It also allows authorities to protect 149 control towers at small- and medium-sized airports that are slated for closure for budgetary reasons. Thousands of flight delays were attributed to the furloughs last week. In time for hurricane season: Furloughs in forecast at NOAA . U.S. airports don't stack up with global competitors .

"(CNN) -- Tunisia's president has formally apologized to a woman charged under an indecency law after being raped by two police officers, the state news agency reported Friday. ""It is quite unfortunate that such events would happen anywhere around the world and it is completely unacceptable to tolerate such a situation in Tunisia,"" President Moncef Marzouki said in the statement, according to TAP, the official news agency. Opinion: Women, free speech, and the Tunisian constitution . The president offered the woman a ""state apology"" after meeting with her and a human rights activist, according to TAP. Marzouki said the government will not tolerate rapists or coverups. However, he said, officers who came forward to expose the assaults prove there is no systemic problem with the nation's security forces. More: Tunisia's President: 'The extremists are a minority of a minority' The case began September 3 when three police officers approached the woman and her fiance while they were in their car in the capital of Tunis, her lawyer told Amnesty International. Two of the officers raped the woman inside the car, while the third took her fiance to a nearby ATM to extort money from him, the woman said. Rights group: Police rape woman in Tunisia, then charge her with indecency . After she filed a complaint and the officers were charged with rape and extortion, the officers said they found the couple in an ""immoral position"" in the car. The woman and her fiance were then charged with ""intentional indecent behavior,"" which could yield up to six months in prison. Both have denied the charges. Opinion: Tunisia's response to police rape puts human rights to shame . The statement did not mention any resolution of the charges against the woman or her fiance. The assaults and accusations against the couple angered human rights groups and inflamed public opinion in the birthplace of the Arab Spring movement. The incident comes after the government angered some critics by rejecting a United Nations recommendation to abolish discrimination against women in areas such as inheritance and child custody. The government has also charged journalists and human rights activists with public immorality and public disorder in an effort to restrict freedom of expression, critics have said.

"(CNN) -- Alleged Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was semi-conscious, wrapped in field gauze and ""covered in blood"" when he arrived late Friday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, according to a detailed first-hand account from a senior employee at the hospital. The source said Tsarnaev appeared to have lost a great deal of blood and was making no sound until he reached the Red Zone Trauma Area, where he began to moan in considerable pain. He didn't seem to utter any words, the source said. Approximately 8-10 medical staff were working on him and there were at least two thoracic surgeons present as well as other surgeons. His condition was stabilized very quickly, said the source. The FBI was inside the trauma room during the stabilization and several other law enforcement agencies were outside the room, including the FBI, Boston police and Beth Israel police, according to the source. Reconstructing the trail of his deleted Instagram account . Other patients were also in the trauma area, separated by curtains, but there were no bombing victims there, the source said. Tsarnaev was taken to X-ray, had a CT scan and was then taken to the operating room. FBI agents stayed nearby during surgery, the source said. Within a matter of hours he was moved to an ICU unit on the upper floors of the hospital. There were no other patients in that secure unit for the duration of the time that he was there and Tsarnaev recovered very quickly, the source said. ""He was in much better shape than most people thought,"" the source said, but had serious wounds to his throat and leg. He has since been transferred with the help of U.S. Marshals to Federal Medical Center, Devens -- a federal prison specializing in long-term medical care, about 40 miles west of Boston.

"(CNN) -- As the NBA's Jason Collins made history by coming out as gay, he sought advice from someone who'd walked this road before: Lance Bass. In case you don't recall, the singer soared to fame in the late '90s as part of the popular boy band 'N Sync, but he didn't open up about his sexuality until 2006. At the time, Bass told People magazine that he was acknowledging it mainly because of rumors, and that coming out made him feel like ""it's on my terms. I'm at peace with my family, my friends, myself and God, so there's really nothing else that I worry about."" Bass, who now hosts SiriusXM's ""Dirty Pop With Lance Bass,"" revealed on his show Monday that Collins reached out to him for guidance through a mutual friend, actress JoAnna Garcia. ""He's been trying to plan this for a very long time, contemplating if he wanted to do this. In fact, he said he was going to call me months ago, but he got too scared,"" Bass said. But with Garcia's encouragement, Collins finally made the call Monday. In NBA, Collins' defense matters more than sexual orientation . ""I gave him some very good advice today, because everybody wants to interview him,"" Bass said. When Bass came out, he recalled wishing he'd had more time to think about whom he wanted to talk to and how he wanted to do it. ""When I came out, I had 24 hours to decide what was going to happen. ... What I wish I could have done back then was to have a couple of days to sit down with (the Human Rights Campaign), sit down with GLAAD (and) get downloaded (on how to handle this)"" Bass said. ""So I gave him some really great connections."" By putting Collins in touch with people such as GLAAD's Wilson Cruz, Bass is aiming to help the athlete ""get some really good information before he does these sit-downs, just so he doesn't put his foot in his mouth ... because this will live (on) for the rest of his life, and he wants to make sure it's good."" Obama 'couldn't be prouder' of Jason Collins . The media crush that comes with such an announcement isn't the only part of Collins' story to which Bass relates. Just as Collins was so busy with basketball that he didn't ruminate on his personal life until the 2011 NBA lockout, Bass said he was too stretched performing with 'N Sync to focus on his personal life. With the lockout, Collins ""finally got to sit back and think about himself, and relationships and love and all of that type of stuff because he had the time -- and that's when he started becoming more comfortable with it and finding out about himself. And that's exactly what happened with me when we went on the hiatus after the last 'N Sync show,"" Bass said. ""We were 24/7, had the same set schedule (and) I didn't have time to think about my personal life. And I totally relate to this because it wasn't until that hiatus where I had a vacation, I had a few weeks off that I became comfortable with it, and met a guy finally and had my first relationship. It was that downtime that really makes you see things."" Bass told his ""Dirty Pop"" listeners that he thinks ""we are going to be overwhelmed with the support he gets,"" which has been steady over the past 24 hours. Many in Hollywood and beyond have joined Garcia and Bass in encouraging the NBA veteran, including President Barack Obama, who told reporters Tuesday he was ""very proud"" of Collins and had spoken with him on the phone. Spike Lee slams Collins hate machine . These are a few celebrities who encouraged the athlete on Twitter: . Russell Simmons: ""(P)roud of Washington Wizards' player Jason Collins (@JasonCollins34) for coming out. (W)e will stand with you as you continue on your journey."" Ellen DeGeneres: ""@NBA center @JasonCollins34 is the 1st out player on a US major league team. I'm overwhelmed by your bravery, Jason, & sending so much love."" Neil Patrick Harris: ""Bravo, @JasonCollins34! Thanks for stepping up. For standing tall. And at 7 feet, that's saying a lot."" Howard Stern: ""Big support to @jasoncollins34. That's not an easy thing you did."" Marlee Matlin: BRAVO to #jasoncollins for his bravery and class. Equality and changing attitudes are just inevitable. Shonda Rhimes: Totally loving me some @jasoncollins34 right now. Well done! Eva Longoria: ""So proud of Jason Collins for being an example of bravery and courage. I applaud you!!!"" On Monday evening, Collins responded on Twitter: ""Thank you to everyone who has reached out to me thru email, texts, calls, tweets, letters, and every other form of communication. #support.""

"(CNN) -- Less than a month after suffering serious burns in a propane grill accident, sports broadcasting pioneer Hannah Storm returned to TV Tuesday, hosting Southern California's historic Rose Parade. Storm, host of ESPN's morning ""SportsCenter,"" was using a propane gas grill outside her Connecticut home three weeks ago when it exploded, ABC said, causing her first- and second-degree burns. Storm lost her eyebrows, eyelashes and much of her hair, according to the network. ""Can't begin to thank you all enough for your kindness and support,"" Storm tweeted Tuesday before the parade. On Monday she tweeted, ""Especially thankful this New Year's!"" The only on-camera evidence of her accident was Storm's bandaged left hand, which was visible at the beginning of the parade broadcast. ""The healing process has begun, and you look as good as ever,"" said her co-host, Josh Elliott, Storm's former partner at ESPN. ""The best medicine is being with you,"" she said. In an interview with ABC's World News, Storm described the accident. She checked on the propane grill on a chilly night and discovered the flame had been blown out. ""The cover of the grill was open so I assumed ... that there wouldn't be any gas in the air. Well, propane is actually heavier than air and especially in cold weather it tends to sit on top of the grill, pool inside,"" she said. ""So the second I relit the flame -- after I turned the gas off ... it was a wall of fire, a huge explosion. So much force that it blew the doors of the grill completely off. ""A neighbor clear across the street had thought a tree had fallen through his roof, that's how loud the explosion was, and it happened in a split second,"" she said. ""And immediately I was on fire, so my hair was on fire, my chest and the whole top of my shirt was on fire. I didn't know what to do other than -- I'm left handed -- reach and just get the shirt off of me as quickly as possible. ""I yelled inside to my 15-year-old daughter who was in the kitchen, 'Mommy's on fire! You have to call 911!' "" Storm said, becoming choked up. Before Tuesday's Rose Parade broadcast, she spent an hour in the makeup room and wore false eyelashes and hair extensions, she said. At one point during the parade broadcast, Storm added a personal note as a float honoring the parade's president -- a nurse -- passed by. ""Thanks to all the great nurses at Westchester burn unit"" who have ""been to my house every day for the last couple of weeks helping me be here today,"" Storm said. Celebrating its 124th year, the parade has made Pasadena famous with its magnificent, colorful floats decorated with rose and other flower petals, stems and leaves. The parade's theme this year was ""Oh, the Places You'll Go,"" a tip of the hat to children's author Dr. Seuss. Related: Chinese and American marching bands unite for Rose Parade . An Atlanta native and Notre Dame alum, Storm pioneered her way into the world of sports journalism. She began her career in the early '80s, when the TV sports industry hired few women. ""I literally couldn't get anyone to hire me,"" she told Forbes.com in 2009. ""Having a woman do sports was seen as too risky."" Her persistence led to on-air sports jobs at CNN and NBC -- where she covered high-profile events including the Olympics, baseball's World Series and the Wimbledon tennis championship. Later, Storm hosted CBS News' ""Early Show,"" where she transcended sports and interviewed newsmakers such as Barack Obama and George W. Bush. Storm, who was born with a port wine-stain birthmark underneath her left eye, founded a charitable organization that helps children with debilitating and disfiguring vascular birthmarks. CNN's Sarah Aarthun and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Storm describes yelling to daughter 'Mommy's on fire...Call 911!""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The doctor convicted in pop star Michael Jackson's death is suffering possibly life-threatening and permanent injuries after almost a year in a small jail cell, his lawyers are warning. Dr. Conrad Murray is housed in a high-security section of the Los Angeles County jail because of his notoriety, which isolates him from the general population for his protection but means he has ""extremely limited access to exercise."" ""Death or injury at the hands of another prisoner, however, is no worse than a slow death caused by a loss of circulation and atrophy resulting from inhumane confinement of a large man in a tiny space,"" lawyers Valerie Wass and Michael Flanagan wrote in a letter addressed to Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca Wednesday. Conrad Murray invites Katherine Jackson to visit him in jail . Murray -- jailed since November 7, 2011, when he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death -- is 6 feet 5 inches tall, but confined in a 5-foot-by-7-foot cell, the letter said. ""If one were to keep a dog in a space just a few inches larger than the dog's length, for any extended period of time, contentions of animal cruelty possibly leading to prosecution would likely result,"" it said. The sheriff's office did not immediately return repeated calls from CNN for comment. Wass, who is overseeing the appeal of Murray's involuntary manslaughter conviction, told CNN Thursday his jail conditions ""are the equivalent of a large individual flying coach in a middle seat for a period of a year."" Murray was taken to a hospital Sunday night for treatment of what his lawyer described as ""marked venous stasis of his lower extremities"" and ""right shoulder pain and severe loss of motion."" Flanagan's letter suggested the sheriff has ""alternatives available to protect society and punish offenders that would not likely result in causing permanent injury or death to an inmate."" California law allows Baca, at his discretion, to release Murray under monitored home confinement. Otherwise, he is supposed to remain in jail for another year. Murray was found guilty of causing Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, by administering a deadly overdose of sedatives and the surgical anesthetic propofol in what he told police was an attempt to cure the singer's insomnia. The doctor was sentenced to the maximum four years in prison, but he is eligible for parole after serving half of his sentence. A California law intended to relieve overcrowding in state prisons resulted in Murray being kept in the county jail. Source of leaked Michael Jackson e-mails identified . His cell there is so small that Murray has ""no opportunity for physical movement throughout the day,"" his lawyers wrote. ""The only actual exercise that Dr. Murray received occurs on most Monday evenings when he is transferred in chains to an 8-by-8 cage on the roof of the facility."" Murray, in a phone call to a friend Monday that was published Wednesday by the celebrity news website TMZ, complained that he feared his illness would be permanent. ""I may never be able to wear a boot again,"" he said. ""The venous stasis gives rise to a high risk for deep vein thrombosis and/or migrating pulmonary embolism,"" his lawyer wrote to the sheriff. ""This condition may have developed to a chronic state which has become permanent and uncorrectable necessitating a lifetime of medication and treatment."" Murray's physical appearance has changed dramatically since he was taken into custody, his lawyer wrote. ""A review of earlier booking photos and bio-statistics of Dr. Murray, when compared to his current condition and appearance, would be shocking to persons not previously familiar with him,"" they wrote. ""To those who have known him for the last year or longer, the suffering that has obviously taken its toll on his health is unimaginable."" DA drops effort to get $100 million restitution from Conrad Murray . Keeping a human in such conditions ""would at the very least give rise to civil liability for negligent confinement resulting in a debilitating medical condition,"" the letter said. ""Please consider this letter as notice of the life-threatening condition in which Dr. Murray currently exists,"" they told the sheriff. ""Correction of this intolerable situation is of extreme importance."" Conrad Murray: 'I feel like a POW'","Keeping a dog in such a tight space would be animal cruelty, Murray's lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- He may be in need of match practice on hard courts, but Rafael Nadal had the good fortune of reaching the last 16 of the Masters Series 1000 tournament in Indian Wells without hitting a ball in anger Monday. His third-round opponent Leonardo Mayer of Argentina withdrew before the start of their match on the Stadium Court, citing a back problem. Nadal, who has slipped to No. 5 in the world rankings after a seven-month injury layoff, made his comeback last month in three clay court tournaments in South America, testing his troublesome knee. He beat Mayer, his second career win over him, in the quarterfinals in Acapulco before going on to claim the title in confident style. But the eyes of the tennis world were on Nadal as he returned to the more unforgiving hard court surface for the first time in 346 days with a second round match against Ryan Harrison of the United States Saturday. The Spanish maestro came through that test 7-6 6-2 to advance to the third round of the tournament for the ninth time, bidding for his third title as the Californian event. He will now get an extra day's rest before facing Ernests Gulbis of Latvia for a place in the quarterfinals Wednesday. Gulbis, renowned for his fiery temperament, smashed his racket during the first set of his match against Andreas Seppi as he lost five straight games to concede it 7-5. But he recovered with fine play in the second set before setting up victory as he broke his Italian opponent in the seventh game of the decider. Gulbis served it out to win 5-7 6-3 6-4 to earn a crack at the 11-time grand slam champion. If Nadal, looking to defend his French Open crown on his favorite clay surface later this year, can get past Gulbis, he is likely to face his first big test with a possible last eight clash against his great rival Roger Federer, the second seed. Defending champion Federer, who said before the start of the tournament that he was ""excited"" by the return of Nadal to top flight action, thrashed Croatia's Ivan Dodig 6-3 6-1 to set up a fourth-round clash with his friend and fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka. Wawrinka, the 18th seed, won 6-4 7-5 against Australian veteran Lleyton Hewitt, who on Saturday beat last year's losing finalist John Isner. Tenth seed Richard Gasquet set up a last-16 clash with world No. 6 Tomas Berdych, while fellow Frenchman Gilles Simon will take on big-serving South African Kevin Anderson. In the women's draw, top seed Victoria Azarenka came from a set down to beat Belgian No. 28 Kirsten Flipkens 3-6 6-3 6-0. The world No. 2 won 12 points in a row to extend her winning streak to 16 matches and set up a fourth-round clash with Poland's Urszula Radwanska. ""I'm really happy that I find the ability to turn around my matches no matter what the circumstances are on the court,"" said the Belorussian, who was criticized after taking a lengthy medical timeout before winning her Australian Open semifinal against Sloane Stephens in late January. ""To know when to take your opportunities is a learning experience. I'm glad I'm starting to master that."" Australian seventh seed Sam Stosur also went to three sets before beating China's Peng Shuai 6-3 3-6 6-2, earning a meeting with Germany's Mona Barthel -- who beat former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic 6-1 3-6 6-0. Caroline Wozniacki, another former No. 1, went through to the last 16 with a 6-2 6-1 win over Elena Vesnina and will next face another Russian in 10th seed Nadia Petrova. German fourth seed Angelique Kerber also progressed, beating Belgium's No. 30 Yanina Wickmayer 6-1 7-6 (7-4) to set up a clash with 95th-ranked Spaniard Garbine Muguruza.","Rafael Nadal into fourth round of Masters 1000 Series at Indian Wells after a walkover .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- The death toll from an outbreak of hepatitis B in India's western Gujarat state reached 38 on Sunday as authorities prepared to begin a vaccination drive against the disease. Hepatitis-B patient Mahir Husain, center, is comforted at a hospital in Ahmedabad. Malayappan Thennarasa, the top administrator of the affected Sabarkantha district, told CNN the toll had climbed to 38 and that shots would be administered free of cost starting Monday. Health officials have recorded 125 cases of the infection in two weeks.   Authorities were carrying out raids at medical stores for bogus drugs and recycled syringes. Police have so far arrested five medical practitioners. One of them was charged Sunday with attempted murder. The doctor is accused of reusing syringes, Thennarasa said. Hepatitis B is a contagious liver disease resulting from infection with the hepatitis B virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It usually spreads through blood, semen, or other bodily fluids, often through sexual contact or sharing needles or syringes with an infected person. The disease can range from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, chronic illness resulting in long-term health problems or death, the CDC said.","An outbreak of contagious liver disease hepatitis B kills 38 people in India .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams shook off any rustiness after a month-long break from competitive tennis as she launched her quest for a sixth Miami title with a straight sets victory over Italian Flavia Pennetta. The world No. 1 hasn't played since losing to Victoria Azarenka in the final of the Qatar Open on February 17 but made light work of her unseeded opponent winning 6-1 6-1. Williams, a 15-time grand slam winner, pulled out of the Dubai Tennis Championships after her defeat in Doha complaining of a back injury but looked in good touch as she raced to victory in just under 80 minutes. ""I think I missed a few shots, but only because I think I was off footwork-wise,"" she told reporters. ""But it's always just good just to win a match and stay in the tournament and keep going. ""I felt like I should be putting the balls away for my opponent but she was so quick and she was running every ball down."" As for coming into the tournament as the world's best player she said: ""It always feels better when you're No. 1. There's nothing like when they announce you and they say, the No. 1 player in the world. ""It definitely gives you a little bit more confidence ... a little more pep in your step. I have a lot of matches to play. If I can just stay relaxed -- I really feel like I can do it, but, you know, I'm sometimes my own worst enemy."" Defending champion and No. 4 seed Agnieszka Radwanska, from Poland, breezed into round three with a 6-3 6-2 victory over Taiwan's Hsieh Su-Wei. ""I was happy to have a quick match,"" Radwanska was quoted as saying on the WTA Tour's official website. ""The first match is always a little bit tough and tricky, especially after Indian Wells, where we had a little bit of different conditions. ""It was a really special tournament for me because I was really playing a lot of good matches against top players and not even losing a set. ""I definitely have great memories from here. And the final was a very good match. Hopefully I can play the same level of tennis this year. I will do everything to hold the trophy again."" China's Li Na, seeded fifth, was also making a return after spending six weeks on the sidelines with an ankle injury but she eased past Dutchwoman Kiki Bertens 6-3 6-1. ""I wasn't nervous before the match today, I was excited,"" Li told the WTA Tour website. ""For the last six or seven weeks I haven't played any tournaments so I was happy to win my first match after such a long time. ""There were a lot of fans there to support me today, I was like, 'Wow!' My game was pretty good today, I followed the plan of what I should do. I just had to believe in myself that I could do it.""

"(CNN) -- When Petra Kvitova won her first grand slam title and the season-ending championships in 2011, big things were expected of the Czech tennis player. It's been a bumpy ride since, as the Czech struggled to live up to expectations last year, but Saturday's victory in the Dubai Tennis Championships final is evidence that the 22-year-old is getting back on track. Kvitova overcame a mid-match scare to beat last year's French Open finalist Sara Errani 6-2 1-6 6-1 to become the first player from her country to win the $2 million tournament. ""I'm glad how I'm playing right now -- that's the important thing for me,"" said Kvitova, who had not won two matches in a row at a WTA event since August before last week's Doha tournament. ""I'm not thinking this is a turning point for me. Yes, it was a lot of great players here and it was hard to beat them, but I'm still just thinking about my game. That's the priority."" It was the former Wimbledon champion's first title in six months, and her biggest since the WTA Championships in Istanbul, as the world No. 8 took home the $442,000 first prize. It capped a big week for Kvitova, who beat former world No. 1 and 2011 Dubai champion Caroline Wozniacki in the semifinals after ending the title defense of fourth-ranked Agnieszka Radwanska following a straight-sets win over Ana Ivanovic. She has bounced back from a shock second-round loss to British teenager Laura Robson at January's Australian Open and a surprise defeat by French wild-card entry Kristina Mladenovic at the Paris Open, winning both matches as the Czechs thrashed Australia in the first match of their Fed Cup title defense. Fifth seed Errani, ranked one place higher than Kvitova, was blown away in the first set but bounced back to take the second as she adopted a more aggressive game and won six games in a row. However, the Italian was unable to maintain that momentum and win her first title this year, and seventh of her career. ""I knew I had to keep fighting for every ball, because she was really on fire in the second set and continued that in the third too,"" said Kvitova, whose coach missed the tournament to go on holiday. ""I was just thinking to not give up and just fight for every point. When it was 2-1 and she missed a volley, I think that was a turning point for me. ""I was quite down after the second set. I just tried to stay positive and just play."" Both players had reached the quarterfinals of the previous tournament in Qatar, where Kvitova lost to new world No. 1 Serena Williams and Errani was beaten by her predecessor Victoria Azarenka. ""This court is very fast, so it's not my favorite court and it's tough for me to play on this court, so making the final is a very good tournament for me,"" Errani said. Doha champion Azarenka and runner-up Williams both pulled out of Dubai due to injuries -- the Belorussian before the tournament, and the American just ahead of her opening match. On the men's ATP World Tour, sixth-ranked Tomas Berdych will play No. 8 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Sunday's final of the Marseille Open. Kvitova's compatriot Berdych beat Russian qualifier Dmitry Tursunov 6-2 6-1, while Tsonga was similarly dominant as he defeated fellow Frenchman Gilles Simon 6-2 6-2. World No. 4 David Ferrer has reached the final of the Copa Claro in Argentina, where he is defending his title. The Australian Open semifinalist beat compatriot Tommy Robredo 6-3 6-2 on Saturday, while Stanislas Wawrinka beat yet another Spaniard in Nicolas Almagro, winning 6-3 7-5. The Swiss third seed reached his first final since January 2011, and has a 3-6 record in title matches.","World No. 8 Petra Kvitova triumphs in $2 million Dubai tournament .

"(CNN) -- He can legitimately claim to be the fastest man on ice, and Kevin Kuske could even give Usain Bolt a run for his money in a foot race over 30 meters. The German bobsleigh superstar already has an imposing tally of four Olympic gold medals and seven world championship titles -- and he's looking for more. Kuske and his two-man teammate Thomas Florschutz can reach speeds of up to 155 kilometers per hour (96 mph), as they hurtle down the high-speed turns and straights. ""It's a speedy sport, a racing type of sport, it's also known as the Formula One of the winter,"" the 33-year-old Kuske told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""There are accidents, I've crashed before and it's definitely dangerous. Sometimes you crash really quickly and get serious injuries. ""Up to now, I've been lucky in my crashes although I've crashed pretty fast and had minor head injuries afterwards."" Kuske is called the brakeman, but it's a misleading title, because he only applies the brake to pull the sled up after the finish. His main job is to push-start the bobsled in the first crucial moments, building momentum before jumping in and allowing the 34-year-old Florschutz to do the steering. His explosive speed off the mark has seen him timed at 3.69 seconds for those opening 30 meters. By comparison, Jamaican sprint hero Bolt was clocked at 3.78 for the same distance on his way to gold in a record-breaking 100 meters time at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Sprinting prowess is one of the key ingredients in a successful bobsleigh team, which is why Jamaica famously dabbled in the sport at the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary, inspiring the 1993 hit film ""Cool Runnings."" Kuske actually started his sporting life as a track and field athlete of some note, claiming a bronze in Germany's 4x100m relay squad at the 1998 world junior championships in Annecy in France. His sheer bulk -- weighing in at 120 kg as against 94 kg for Bolt -- was always going to be a barrier on the track, and he was persuaded to try a new challenge by Germany's national bobsled team coach Gerd Leopold. It proved to be an inspired selection, and Kuske won his first Olympic gold medal at Salt Lake in 2002 as part of the victorious German four-man team. Double gold followed in the two and four-man teams in Turin four years later, with his fourth gold in the two-man in the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver and a silver in the four-man. Florschutz was a driver in the Germany II pair that took silver in the two-man in Canada and has now teamed up with Kuske to focus on going one better at the world championships next year in St. Moritz in Switzerland in January and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Punishing training . Despite their advancing years, the pair have a punishing regime, particularly in their ""off"" season. ""We're winter sportsmen, who were made in summer. We have to sweat in the summer while others are lying down in the sun,"" Florschutz said. They train twice a day, six days a week, totaling about seven hours per day. ""Sunday is more laidback, just a bit of upper body strength. And we've got one unit that lasts three to four hours,"" said Kuske. The four-time Olympic champion concentrates on a mixture of strength training with weights and sprint training, often pulling a weight behind him for extra resistance. Florschutz also has to play his part as they charge down the course, pushing a sled weighing 170 kg, so his training is along similar lines, but as the pilot or driver he has the responsibility to capitalize on the blistering start. ""The pilot is always the first one sitting in there,"" he said, ""so that you can get to the steering cords quickly and to be able to react quickly, too."" Formula One feeling . Lightning-fast reflexes are indeed a prerequisite of the driver's role, as the sled hurtles down an icy chute with the speed increasing all the time. ""I just try to drive straight down the track, but you really have to work together,"" said Florschutz. For Kuske's part, his job is curl up into an aerodynamic position, not easy given his bulk, then flow with the rhythm going through the corners, supporting the driver with his weight -- rather like a motorcycle pillion passenger. ""And of course braking at the right time, so as not to let the pilot get too terrified!"" he said -- unlike the ""Cool Runnings"" team who suffer a comical crash in the film after failing to stop at the end of the run. The F1 comparison begins and ends with the speed comparison, because unlike a Sebastian Vettel or Lewis Hamilton, the pair have to repair and ""fine tune"" their own bobsled rather than having a massive team of mechanics to assist them. And despite being at the top of their sport, both have trained for other professions -- Florschutz is a policeman while Kuske is in the German Federal Defense Force (the ""Bundeswehr."") German domination . They are seeking to continue the level of domination achieved by the German men's bobsleigh teams in world and Olympic championships. Since Kuske's first Winter Games in 2002, German two-man teams have won three straight golds, achieving a 1-2 finish at Vancouver 2010. In the four-man event, two gold medals were followed by a silver behind the U. S. quartet -- which, strangely given his winning record, Kuske rates as his most memorable achievement. ""The best was the silver medal in Vancouver. We had the best start times but we almost fell on our side on one run,"" he said. ""To pull that back and win the silver by one-hundredth (of a second, from Canada) was for me an emotional eruption, as it was truly hard earned."" Kuske came from a strong sporting background -- both his parents were in the German national track and field team -- and they encouraged him to go one better. ""We had a family dream to go to the Olympics. When you're sitting in front of the TV and watching the Olympic Games, and you have sporty parents, that's naturally a big dream for you, because the Olympics are the biggest event there is,"" he said. ""Naturally it became more than a dream, at the first Olympics with the gold medal, and that was really my greatest goal, which I fulfilled pretty quickly, but it didn't stop there."" Golden focus . His longevity and medal haul have seen him earn celebrity status in Germany, while Florschutz has won three world championship silvers and Olympic silver in Vancouver. He is hoping his partnership with Kuske, formed after the great German driver Andre Lange retired, will see him earn that elusive gold. ""Our biggest aim is to become the world champions and to become Olympic champions. We're a strong team. We've got every chance to be the best in the world with this team.""","Kevin Kuske and Thomas Florschutz represent Germany at two-man bobsleigh .

The Czech star has beaten three top 12 opponents in succession and will now compete in her first final in sixth months. Azarenka out of Dubai Open . ""I'm really glad how I played today - it was a great match,"" Kvitova told the WTA official website. ""We are different players. She tries to put the balls back, and I'm the person who is playing aggressively and going for the winners. ""So what happens in the match really depends on if I'm missing a lot or no, and I played well today. ""The atmosphere here is really nice. I enjoyed every moment today and I'm happy I'm in the final."" Williams follows Azarenka in quitting Dubai . Wozniacki, who won the tournament two years ago, showed glimpses of quality, but failed to deal with the forceful nature of Kvitova's attack. ""She just went for every shot and hit it deep, and I came under pressure straightaway,"" Wozniacki added. ""I thought I served well, though. In the second set I think I had my chances, and I probably should have taken them but I didn't. ""You never know what could have happened in the third set but there was still a long way to go. At the end of the day, she played a very good match out there. ""Petra's a player that when she's on fire, she's on fire and she wins a lot of matches."" Vinci and Errani to meet in Dubai . Meanwhile, World No.7 Errani defeated her doubles partner Robert Vinci 6-3 6-3 following an hour and 23 minute battle. ""It's tough to play against one person who knows what you're going to do with every shot,"" she told the WTA website. Errani will go into the final as favorite having won each of her three previous meetings against Kvitova without dropping a set. But Kvitova believes she has every chance of springing a surprise Saturday. ""We've played a few times, but she's a Top 10 player,"" she added. ""She has a good forehand with big spin and is quite fast on the backhand. ""She moves very well, too. She has had great results in the past and played quite well today, and she beat Petrova yesterday too. She's a very tough opponent. ""I think it will be a really tough match tomorrow."" At the U.S Indoor Tennis Championships, Germany's Sabine Lisicki will face Marina Erakovic of New Zealand in Saturday's final. Lisicki, who is aiming to win a fourth WTA tour title, defeated Magdalena Rybarikova in the semifinals 7-5 7-5, while Erakovic defeated Switzerland's Stefanie Voegele 6-2 6-4. Elsewhere, home favorite Jo-Wilfried Tsonga booked his place in the semifinals of the Marseille Open following a 4-6 6-3 7-6 win over Australia's Bernard Tomic. ""I felt I was playing better than him, but there were some holes in my game,"" Tsonga told reporters. ""I am happy to get through because it was very, very tense."" Tsonga, who will meet fellow countryman Gilles Simon in the last four, fought off five match points before claiming victory. Simon overcame Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro, who won last week's Rotterdam Open, 6-4 6-3 with the second seed needing treatment on a thigh injury. In the other semifinal, Russian qualifier Dmitry Tursonov will face top seed Tomas Berdych. Tursunov saw off Gilles Muller of Luxembourg 7-6 1-6 7-5, while Czech star Berdych overcame Poland's Jerzy Janowicz 6-3 6-7 6-3.","Petra Kvitova booked her place in the final of the Dubai Open .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic stretched his unbeaten run to 16 matches as the World No.1 was joined in the semifinals in Dubai by five-time winner and defending championRoger Federer Thursday. Djokovic has been in imperious form at the hard court event and was never troubled by quarterfinal opponent Andreas Seppi of Italy, winning 6-0 6-3 in 64 minutes. Federer was equally impressive against Russian veteran Nikolay Davdenko, dropping just four games in a straight sets romp. But they face much tougher tests in the last four clashes Friday, with Djokovic playing in-form fourth seed Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina and Federer taking on third ranked Tomas Berdych, who beat him in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open last year. It is the first time in the history of the 20-year-old Dubai Open that all top four seeds have reached the semifinals and del Potro and Berdych were largely untroubled in their last eight clashes. Del Potro outclassed World No.97 Daniel Brands 6-4 6-2 while Berdych overpowered Russian wild card Dmitry Tursunov 6-3 6-2 in just over an hour. Australian Open champion Djokovic's streak dates back to November last year, but he knows he will have to be on top of his game against del Potro, who won in Rotterdam earlier this month. ""Delpo is a very talented player, very powerful from the baseline and with a big service. We know everything about each other, it's going to be a tough one and I need to be on top of my game,"" he told the official ATP website. World No.2 Federer knows formidable Czech Berdych will offer a difficult test as he bids fora place in the final and his 77th career title. ""He's obviously a good player. He's got amazing power, one of the strongest guys out there on tour. We'll see tomorrow how it goes. I haven't seen him play at all here this tournament. I need to just focus on my game,"" said the Swiss. In Federer's favor may be the tough schedule of his opponent, who had to fly from Marseille where he lost to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France in Sunday's final. Tsonga also made the long trip, but exited in the first round to fellow Frenchman Michael Llodra.","Novak Djokovic continues 2013 winning streak .

"(CNN) -- It took five days for Colorado authorities to realize a parolee disabled his ankle monitor and fled, beginning what investigators would later say was a deadly crime spree that ended in a shootout in Texas, according to records released Tuesday. The documents released by the Colorado Department of Corrections detail how 28-year-old Evan Ebel managed to elude authorities in the days leading up to the killings of prisons chief Tom Clements and part-time pizza deliveryman Nathan Leon. The state Department of Corrections did not respond to repeated requests from CNN for comment. The release of the documents follows news this week that a clerical error resulted in Ebel's release four years early from prison. That revelation prompted an apology from the district court where the mistake was made. Ebel was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2005 for armed robbery. In 2008, he was sentenced to another four years -- to be served consecutively -- for punching a prison guard. A clerical error listed Ebel's four-year sentence as concurrent, meaning he would not have to serve additional time beyond his original sentence. For Leon's wife, it was too little, too late. ""Clerical error ain't going to bring my husband back,"" Katherine Leon told CNN affiliate KUSA. ""[It] ain't going to bring Tom Clements back. It's not going to bring my children's father back. How do I tell my 4-year-old (that) daddy was murdered because of a clerical error?"" Authorities have speculated Ebel might have killed Leon for his uniform so he could use it as a disguise in the killing of Clements, who was gunned down after he opened his front door. Investigators have said they are looking into whether Ebel, a member of a white supremacist prison gang, might have conspired with other inmates to kill Clements. The corrections chief earned widespread recognition not only for prison reforms but also for a crackdown on prison gangs, including the white supremacist 211 Crew, who once counted Ebel among their ranks. Ebel was released from prison on January 28, according to the records. Between his release and March 13, Ebel appeared to comply with his parole, which required he wear an ankle monitor, check in daily with parole officials by phone, abide by an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and stay out of bars, the records show. Ebel told prison guard she would 'beg for her life' The first indication something was wrong came March 14, when the ankle monitor gave off a ""tamper alert."" Here is a timeline of how Ebel managed to elude authorities, according to the corrections department documents and previous statements by authorities: . March 14 . Ebel made his daily telephone call to check in with parole officials at 7:20 a.m. The ""tamper alert"" went off at 1:54 p.m., and the company that oversees the monitoring system -- known as HomeGuard 206 -- notes the alert at 3:21 p.m. Initially, the ankle monitor was listed ""for repair"" and a message was left for Ebel to make arrangements to fix the ankle monitor. By 11:15 p.m., Ebel had not checked in for messages. March 15 . Ebel failed to check in with parole officials, and a message was left for him to report to an appointment scheduled for the next day to repair his ankle monitor. Ebel again failed to pick up messages. His whereabouts, at this point, were unknown. March 16 . The ""tamper alert"" for Ebel's ankle monitor was still active, and he failed to show up for an appointment to repair the monitor. March 17 . Contractors who oversaw the ankle monitoring of inmates notified parole officials that Ebel failed to ""make contact"" to have his ankle monitor repaired. Authorities believe this was the same day that Ebel killed Leon, the pizza deliveryman, whose body was found in the suburban Denver community of Golden. March 18 . Parole officials contacted Ebel's family to inquire about his whereabouts. March 19 . Parole officials searched Ebel's residence and determined he left quickly or went into hiding to avoid arrest. They begin paperwork to revoke his parole. That night, Clements was shot to death at his home outside Colorado Springs. March 20 . The state Department of Corrections issued a warrant for Ebel's arrest, citing parole violations. March 21 . Ebel was killed in northern Texas in a gun battle with authorities that left a sheriff's deputy wounded. CNN's Carma Hassan, Dana Ford and Mark Morgenstein contributed to this report.","NEW: It took five days for parole officials to realize Evan Ebel fled, records show .

"(CNN) -- What is it like to be thrown behind bars when you're 16 and told you'll languish there for the rest of your life, all for a crime you adamantly maintain you didn't commit? Louis Taylor knows. He was convicted of arson in a fire that killed 29 people. But forensic experts now say they can no longer determine whether someone set the hotel fire on that cool winter day in 1970. And on Tuesday, in a Tucson, Arizona, courtroom, he pleaded no contest to the charges in a new hearing and was sentenced to time served -- almost 43 years. Taylor, now 59 with a shaved head, stood quietly during Tuesday's proceedings. But the son of one of the victims of the disastrous blaze at the Pioneer Hotel left him with a warning. ""I harbor no feelings of ill will or vengeance against you, for my father is now gone and nothing can ever be done to change that fact,"" Paul D'hedouville II said. ""Do as you choose, Mr. Taylor, but choose wisely and do not waste your new beginning at life. The eyes of this courtroom and those beyond these walls, in mind and spirit, will be watching you."" Taylor spoke briefly to reporters after he traded his orange prison garb for a T-shirt and slacks and walked out of prison, saying, ""It feels good to feel Mother Earth beneath my feet -- free Mother Earth."" ""It's a tale of two tragedies -- the Pioneer Hotel fire, and me getting convicted for it,"" he said. A vintage landmark burns . The Pioneer Hotel, built in 1929, was renowned for its gracious ballroom. At 11 floors, it was a protruding gem in downtown Tucson's skyline at the time. On December 20, 1970, the vintage hotel was filled with guests, and hundreds more were reveling in holiday cheer at a corporate Christmas party. Just after midnight, a blaze broke out. The landmark building's firefighting measures were badly out of date, and the Pioneer quickly transformed into an inferno. A morbid spectacle of human tragedy unfolded. Twenty-eight people died from smoke inhalation, burns, or, in some cases, when they jumped out of windows to escape. The fire wiped out whole families. Jake Crellin was the first journalist on the scene. ""I still have flashbacks from time to time from some of the stuff I saw, flashbacks of people jumping out of windows to their death,"" said the former news director of CNN affiliate KVOA. He avoided looking at the scene with the naked eye, gazing instead through the viewfinder of a camera. ""It helped make it a little easier to watch,"" he told the affiliate. A crowd of bystanders gathered and looked on in horror. Some hotel guests were able to knot bed sheets together to make ropes and rappel to safety. It was one of the deadliest tragedies in Tucson's history. A quick arrest . Within hours, police arrested a teenage boy, court documents said. It was Louis Taylor, who had been inside the hotel. He wasn't a guest and did not work there. And he had books of matches in his pocket. During police interrogations, the juvenile claimed to have seen someone set the fire. This was before anyone had suspected arson. But the young man changed his story multiple times. It made officers suspicious: Maybe it was arson; maybe it was Taylor who started the fire. Criminal witnesses . Journalist Crellin and KVOA kept up with the case. Taylor told him that ""he had some very tough interviews with the police."" He was innocent, he said, a stance he has always maintained. In an interview on the 25th anniversary of the fire, he told the broadcaster that the fire never goes out of his head. ""I think about it all the time, because I know in my heart and God knows that they got the wrong person. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time."" Prosecutors called two witnesses who were in juvenile detention with Taylor. They told the court that Taylor confessed to the crime to them behind bars. Later, one of the boys said he had been coerced into his testimony and that it was false, according to court documents. Experts for the prosecution and the defense testified that the fire, in their opinion, was caused by arson, though the details of their explanations differed. In the end, Taylor was convicted of 28 counts of felony murder. Judge Charles Hardy, who presided over the case, told Taylor that he didn't believe he meant to hurt anyone. But the punishment was stiff: ""the rest of his natural life in prison,"" a sentence that at the time did not officially exist in the state of Arizona, a court document said. In hindsight . Decades later, people involved in the conviction and sentencing began to feel bad about the case. The CBS investigative magazine ""60 Minutes"" took up the case. The judge told the program that, looking back, he would not have voted to convict. The evidence, he said, was not strong enough. And if the then-teenager did set the fire, it was not Taylor's fault that the hotel was poorly suited to deal with any kind of fire. Lawyers from the Arizona Justice Project got involved. The non-profit reviews cases it feels don't live up to just legal standards. ""It is our mission to help assure that Arizona's prisons are not housing those actually innocent of crime or otherwise victims of manifest injustice,"" reads the mission statement on its website. The lawyers encouraged the state to review the arson testimony in the original trial based on modern methods. Two review committees determined that there is no longer enough evidence available to tell whether arson was in play. They said that the experts in the original trial ""used methods no longer valid in the science of today."" One of the original trial experts, Cy Holmes, still a fire investigator four decades later, still stands by his testimony today, a court memorandum filed Monday said. But his testimony can't pin it on Taylor. CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: ""It feels good to feel Mother Earth beneath my feet,"" Louis Taylor says .

"(CNN) -- Polish Formula One star Robert Kubica will be driving in a supporting category of the world rallying championship this season as he continues his recovery from the serious injuries he sustained in a crash in Italy two years ago. The accident in February 2011, during a rallying competition in Italy, left Kubica with limited use of his right hand and with doubts about his future at the highest level of motor sport. The 28-year-old will drive a Citroen DS3 RRC in the seven-round WRC 2 Championship, as well as selected events in Europe. Kubica took the wheel in national rally championship events towards the end of last year, including two for Citroen, and will be driving with a specially adapted gearbox to compensate for his hand injury. ""I can't wait to start racing, but I haven't set myself any specific target. I still have a lot to learn in rallying and to improve I will need to rack up the miles on the stages,"" he told world rallying's official website. ""I weighed up the different options before deciding on this program,"" said the Krakow-born driver. ""I kept in touch with Citroen Racing and both sides were keen to continue working together. I'm really pleased now to be able to return to top-level racing."" Kubica's season will get underway at the Rally Islas Canarias -- the third round of the FIA European Rally Championship later this month -- before he opens his campaign in the WRC 2 at April's Rally de Portugal. Citroen team principal Yves Matton said Kubica deserved to succeed in his comeback because of his fighting spirit. ""Robert's determination is an example to us all and we are proud to associate Citroen Racing's image with such a resolutely positive individual,"" he added. Kubica was considered one of the most promising drivers in F1 before his crash, winning the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix with Sauber before switching to Lotus Renault for the 2010 season. He finished eighth in the title race and was preparing for the 2011 season when taking part in the Ronde de Andorra rally in Italy in a private capacity he lost control of his Skoda Fabia, crashing into a guard rail. He spent some time in an induced coma and as well as his horrific hand injury suffered fractures to his right elbow, shoulder and leg. Recovery was painstaking, but he confirmed in November 2011 that he would not be able to take his place in the Lotus Renault team for the 2012 season. An accident near his Italian home in early 2012, where he re-broke his right leg, was also a setback, but Kubica has stuck doggedly to his rehabilitation program.","Robert Kubica to drive in WRC2 rally championship this season .

"Saariselka, Finland (CNN) -- It has been a long and cold winter in Europe. You might think an invitation to spend a weekend in Northern Finland with more icy weather would be the last thing anyone would have wanted. Not a bit of it. When the invitation came to attend the Lapland Retreat deep in the Arctic Circle I jumped at the chance. Finland's PM Jyrki Katainen and Europe minister Alex Stubb, host the retreat and this year invited the prime ministers of Denmark, Croatia and Latvia, along with the president of Estonia, the deputy PM of Turkey and the Europe minister from Ireland. Several more including a member of the ECB and ministers from Spain and Portugal pulled out at the last moment. This is an eclectic group of countries: two hardline EU members, (Finland and Denmark), a country about to join in July (Croatia), one in the middle of a bailout (Ireland) and one on the outside wanting to join but so far spurned (Turkey). Read Quest: Cypriot disastrous decision . The idea was to avoid being bogged down in the crises du jour, this year, Cyprus. Rather, think Big Thoughts about the future of Europe while wearing slippers, wrapped up in blankets in a remote log cabin. It is a quixotic goal since the very future of Europe depends on its ability, or failure, to handle crises, such as Cyprus; which frankly it has spectacularly failed to do. The metaphors were everywhere. The reindeer at the welcome family photocall managed to poop all over the ground, which was quickly shovelled over with fresh white snow in time for the pictures ... like the euro crises, covered up but still smouldering underneath. Looking at the reindeers antlers was imaging leaders impaled on the horns of euro-dilemmas. Freezing European economies. Icy conditions. Oh I could go on. Read Quest: Cyprus bailout is nothing more than usual Euro nonsense . It was striking how strident these leaders were about what needs to be done. ""Austerity with growth,"" said Finland's prime minister, in other words, just as his country has done. Finland incidentally has just had a tax-raising budget, cutting spending but still managing to lower corporation tax. It can be done, came the satisfied shrill from the north. ""Follow the rules,"" said Denmark's Helle Thorning-Schmidt. She returned to the theme again and again. If countries had done what they were supposed to do, we wouldn't be in the mess we are. Whatever sympathy there may be for the people of Cyprus froze like the lakes outside when they spoke of the Cyprus banking system. Sobriquets such as ""unique,"" ""unusual,"" ""unprecedented"" were used when what they wanted to say was ""out-of-control-Wild-West-money-laundering banking-industry."" Oh yes, with Russian money (you can always rely on the Finns to put the boot in, ever so politely, to Russia). Read Quest: U.S. economy to dominate Davos 2013 . The Finnish PM rejected the idea he was a hardliner (he is) preferring to call himself a pragmatist. The difference matters not. Finland is one of those countries, along with Germany, that has had enough of bailouts. Alex Stubb, its Europe minister, made clear the future for European rescues is bailing in with investors' money not bailing out with Finland's taxpayer cash. Attending the Lapland retreat was fascinating. Not because of the reindeer I ate (it really is a delicious meat) or because the snow this far north is, well, really white. But because I got to see leaders at their most honest: all the PMs had taken their own hard decisions, for instance Croatia preparing for euro membership and terrified about Italy's chaotic economy on its doorstep; Estonia, dealing with multi-year recession; Finland with its own anti-Europe factions. So they have had enough. They want the 27 member countries to get on with it. Sort it out. Deal with it. Concentrate on issues like digital single market, growth. The only problem, everyone says, is that change comes as quickly as a Lapland thaw. Just as with the reindeer poop, which as far as I know is still there, covered up, like the euro crises.","Finland's political leaders held an informal summit in Saariselka, Lapland this weekend .

"(CNN) -- Three goals in just 10 second half minutes sank Basel and set Chelsea on their way to the Europa League final Thursday and an Amsterdam date with Portuguese giants Benfica. Leading 2-1 from the first leg in Switzerland, Chelsea trailed at half time of their home leg at Stamford Bridge to an injury time goal from rising young Egyptian star Mohamed Salah. But their fears were allayed as Fernando Torres, Victor Moses and David Luiz, who will be facing his old club in the final, struck to snuff out Basel's hopes. Benfica, trailing 1-0 from the first leg in Turkey against Fenerbahce, went through 3-2 on aggregate after a hard-fought 3-1 home win. Nicolas Gaitan drew them level on aggregate with an exquisite ninth minute strike, but the visitors were ahead again in the 23rd minute thanks to a penalty from former Liverpool striker Dirk Kuyt. But Benfica were not to be denied and an Oscar Cardozo double either side of half time sealed their passage to the final in the Dutch city on May 15. They will stand between Chelsea interim manager Rafael Benitez and his only possible silverware in his troubled spell at the English Premier League giants. Benitez has previously led Valencia to a 2004 success in the competition. Home fans, who have not warmed to the Spaniard, were initially chanting the name of Jose Mourinho, who has hinted at a return to Chelsea, but by the finish would have been satisfied by the outcome. Defiant Benitez . Benitez remained defiant: ""I came to do a professional job with the commitment of the players. I am pleased for them and everyone here,"" he told ITV Sport. ""We have had a very good atmosphere, the players have always worked hard, and they have always done their job."" Chelsea's progression to the final looked to be under threat after Salah swept past Petr Cech from Valentin Stocker's fine through ball. But Torres, who has been in excellent form in Europe's second tier club competition, changed all that as he seized on a loose ball after Yann Sommer had kept out Frank Lampard's shot. Three minutes later saw the second Chelsea goal as Torres had his low shot deflected into the path of Moses, who scored from close range. Brazilian ace Luiz capped the goal scoring burst just before the hour mark with a stunning curled effort from outside the penalty area. Fabian Frei hit the crossbar for Basel, but they were well beaten and Chelsea might have added to their tally by the finish. It was third time lucky for Chelsea, who were beaten in the semifinals of the English FA Cup and League Cup, while Benfica will be contesting a first major European final since 1990.","Chelsea to play Benfica in Europa League final .

"(CNN) -- French club Monaco have served further notice of their intent to challenge at the top of world football by completing the signing of Atletico Madrid striker Radamel Falcao. The five-year deal for the Colombian, who has found the net 28 times for Spanish Cup winners Atletico in the league this season, is the latest in a series of high-profile acquisitions by the newly promoted principality club. The transfer fee wasn't disclosed by Monaco, but it was reported to be almost $80 million. ""I'm very happy to join AS Monaco and very happy to wear these new colors,"" Falcao said in a video message on Monaco's Web site. Earlier this month Monaco's owner Dmitry Rybolovlev -- worth $9.1 billion, according to Forbes -- funded the transfers of Porto pair Joao Moutinho and James Rodriguez for $90 million. When Rybolovlev acquired a majority stake in the club in December 2011, Monaco were bottom of the French second tier. Italian coach Claudio Ranieri guided the team to the Ligue 2 title and will be expected to lead his expensively assembled squad towards the upper echelons of French football and, ultimately, into continental competition. ""We are absolutely delighted that Radamel Falcao has accepted the challenge of coming to play for AS Monaco FC,"" Rybolovlev told the club's Web site. ""We are proud to have secured one of the best players in the world and confident that he will help ASMFC regain its rightful status."" The signing of Falcao is a major coup for the seven-time French champions. The 27-year-old arrived in European football from Argentina's River Plate in 2009 and went on to score 41 goals in 51 games for Porto as the Portuguese team won the Europa League. The Santa Marta-born forward moved to the Spanish capital in 2011 and his goals helped Atletico clinch the Europa League crown in 2012. Falcao's stock rose considerably after he scored a hat-trick against Champions League winners Chelsea in the 2012 European Super Cup, played at Monaco's Stade Louis II Stadium. He had been linked with a switch to Atletico's city rivals Real Madrid as well as a host of other illustrious European clubs. Falcao's status for Atletico's final game of the season, at Zaragoza on Saturday, wasn't known.","Radamel Falcao signs for Monaco after he was linked with, among others, Real Madrid .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Birthdays are always a good time for reflection. My 20s were  mostly fun times, hanging out and risk-taking professionally. My 30s were about really focusing on the career and traveling to places I finally had some money to afford. Now, one year into my 40s, I'm blessed with home ownership and the realization that I am officially a ""grown-up."" The childish mistakes that you could laugh off in your 20s and consider a growing experience in your 30s should now be gone by 40. When you're dating after 40, the reaction you get from family and friends on your birthday is also totally different. I decided to have my latest birthday party at my new house. It was a nice gathering of family and friends, including the man that I have been dating for a couple of months. For some of my family and friends, it was the first time they were seeing my newly purchased home. I was excited to show folks my proud accomplishment of home ownership. Each group that I showed around the house --regardless of age or gender -- had the same question when they saw the two spare bedrooms. ""So, what do you plan to do with THESE bedrooms?"" I pondered the question each time, realizing I couldn't say I'd use it as an office since I had one set up downstairs. My answers varied from ""how about a guest room"" to ""possibly a home gym"" to ""I really don't know."" Their reaction each and every time was exactly the same: ""How about some kids?"" My first response was ""with whom?"" -- seriously, I am not married -- then I realized they were referring to my new beau. I started stammering and was slightly embarrassed, especially when he was in my presence for some of these questions. It seems folks get really comfortable with certain questions after you pass that important milestone of 40. I gave all the right answers: that buying a house made more sense than a townhouse in this market, I realized the amount of equity I could get buying in this neighborhood and of course the first-time home buyer credit was too much to pass up. No one seemed interested in those answers, so the conversation quickly changed to something else. After all, if I were in my 20s or 30s and dating, the house likely would have been viewed by most as a great investment. Also, it's not to say that these questions about marriage didn't occur in those earlier years. But somehow in your 40s, a choice had to be made. Society does seem to put an enormous amount of pressure on women once they hit the later years of childbearing age. Assumptions are made that every personal decision is a reflection of your desire to have, or not have, children. So, needless to say, my friends and family saw my house as a symbol of my last-ditch effort to claim a white picket fenced yard filled with kids. These were all questions that I never expected to confront at a casual birthday barbecue. The questions -- but more importantly my reaction -- made me consider the possibility that I did subconsciously purchase this house hoping that I would fill those bedrooms with kids instead of workout equipment. Was I, in fact, laying the groundwork for the future I hoped to have -- of marriage, children and a dog? At the closing attorney's office the day I bought the house, I remember being more interested in the incredible investment I just made. After all the birthday party guests had left, I asked my beau if the questions about children made him feel uncomfortable. He smartly answered ""no"" and seemed surprised that I never expected that question to come up. I quickly pointed out to him that if the roles were reversed, I didn't think that people would make that assumption with a man. So, I might have another barbecue for the Fourth of July. Just to make things interesting and confuse folks, I might just rent a dog and watch the assumptions begin. Editor's note: Audrey Irvine is a senior assignment manager for CNN.

"San Diego (CNN) -- It used to be that when Americans thought of Mexico, they imagined a festive getaway where margaritas flowed, mariachis played, and every day was Cinco de Mayo. Not anymore. Horrifying stories of random shootings, mass beheadings and mass graves have become commonplace. Gunmen think nothing of mowing down a couple dozen teenagers in a disco with machine guns and tossing grenades indiscriminately into crowds during holiday fiestas. Mexicans have almost become immune to carnage, it seems. As a result of such wanton acts of terrorism, and government efforts to combat them, more than 47,500 have died in the last 5Â½ years. Many of the dead were believed by authorities to have been connected to the drug trade, but others were innocent civilians -- including women and children -- who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Many Mexicans wrongly put the blame for those deaths entirely on the shoulders of Mexican President Felipe Calderon. The argument goes that, if Calderon had only left the cartels alone, Mexico wouldn't be on fire. Calderon is a convenient target because he has made it his personal mission to destroy Mexico's drug syndicates. We're talking about a half-dozen drug cartels, each of which rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars annually in a country so poor that the average laborer is lucky to earn $8 a day. The cartels' customers are mainly Americans, who consume more than their share of illegal drugs. Is Calderon winning his war? Hard to say. It's true that a few cartels have been weakened; government officials say that the drug syndicate La Familia has all but been destroyed. What they don't say is that, from the ashes, has arisen a new group called Knights Templar. So the horror continues. Just recently, in a widely reported case, Mexican police found 49 mutilated bodies in a small town between the cities of Monterrey and Reynosa near the U.S.-Mexico border. Heads, arms and legs were chopped off, making it difficult for authorities to identify the dead. Q&A: 49 bodies - just another drug war crime? It's like a Shakespearean tragedy where every act is bloodier than the one before it, and they go on without end. A new generation of drug traffickers aiming to be bosses seems locked in a gruesome contest as to who can be the most vicious. As for blame, Mexicans should at least dole it out correctly. Calderon is responsible for his decision to use the Mexican military as the government's chief weapon against the cartels, in part because so many of the local police in Mexico are thought to be corrupt or corruptible. And so, when the military is accused of being heavy-handed with civilians and violating the rights of Mexican citizens, as it has been in recent years, that blame should go to Calderon. But the Mexican people also bear a responsibility -- for empowering the drug lords. For decades, Mexicans have romanticized the drug trafficking industry in film, music and other aspects of popular culture. There are many ""corridos"" (Mexican ballads) that tell the story of the rise-from-nothing fellow who becomes the head of a powerful syndicate by relying on his wits and strength. Recently, Mexican actress Kate del Castillo -- who coincidentally was cast as a powerful female drug lord in Telemundo's Spanish-language series ""La Reina del Sur"" -- tweeted that she has more faith in Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman than she does in government. Guzman heads the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, and once landed on Forbes' list of the world's richest people with an estimated net worth of $1 billion. There are even so-called drug saints that some Mexicans pray to -- inspired by Robin Hood-like figures who are seen as protectors of the poor against the government. Of course, the Catholic Church doesn't recognize these saints, but this fact hasn't made them any less popular. One of the most popular of the ""narco saints"" is JesÃºs Malverde, named after a bandit, who legend has it, was killed by authorities in the early 1900s. Known as the ""generous bandit"" or the ""angel of the poor,"" Malverde is a folk hero to some in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. Mexico is in chaos. And many Mexicans are in shock. They don't know what to do, or even if they can do anything at all. Well, they can do this: They can stop making folk heroes out of murderers and terrorists. They can stop writing poems and songs that honor drug traffickers and instead start praising the Mexican law enforcement officers who are bravely trying to bring these outlaws to justice. And they can support their government and stand by their president in fighting a battle that needed to be fought. It's time to step up and take ownership of the drug war -- as well as the circumstances that made it necessary. People on both sides of the border had a hand in helping make this mess. It's going to take people on both sides of the border to clean it up. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette: Drug violence has become so common in Mexico, some are used to it .

"(CNN) -- Championship leader Dani Pedrosa claimed his first pole position this season after stunning MotoGP titleholder Jorge Lorenzo with a scorching late lap at Mugello. The Honda rider will head the starting grid for Sunday's Italian Grand Prix, having relegated his fellow Spaniard Lorenzo to second for Yamaha. Andrea Dovizioso secured the final place on the front row for home team Ducati, despite angering Pedrosa with his tactics in Saturday's qualifying and receiving a shake of the fist during the session. ""He was trying to follow me,"" Pedrosa told the MotoGP website after clocking one minute 47.157 seconds to clinch the 25 pole of his career. ""I understand his position. It was not only him, he was just one of them, but everything is alright. ""It was a hard session at the end. I could not really find a space to do a lap time -- many riders were behind me. I was not high up in the order before my last lap, but was able to do a great lap."" Lorenzo, who trails Pedrosa by 17 points in third overall, had been seeking his third pole in five attempts this year. However, motorcycling's two-time world champion missed out by 0.069 seconds despite beating Pedrosa's record lap time from last year. ""I was surprised by my lap time, that was really impressive and I didn't expect it,"" said the Mallorcan, who won last year's race from Pedrosa. ""I also didn't expect the lap time from Dani on the second try. I expected to be on pole, but that happens sometimes... ""We have to try to make a good start to lead the race at the beginning because we have strong pace on the first two laps. It is going to be really difficult, as Dani and his team have improved the bike so much and he has improved his riding style."" Dovizioso, who injured his neck after crashing on Friday, sympathized with Pedrosa but said he had done nothing wrong to his former teammate. ""He complained because too many riders delayed him, but I can understand him because he was fast and wanted a clear track to try and do the best,"" the 27-year-old Italian said. ""But when you haven't disrupted his fast lap, he can't say anything."" Britain's Cal Crutchlow heads the second row in fourth for Monster Yamaha Tech 3, ahead of Germany's Stefan Bradl on a Honda LCR. Pedrosa's new Honda Repsol teammate Marc Marquez will start back in sixth after three crashes in the past two days meant he did not qualify in the top-10 and had to go through the eliminator for the first time in his rookie season. The 20-year-old is the only rider to have finished on the podium in all four races, and trails Pedrosa by six points in the standings. ""Sixth place today was the best that we could have hoped for and I am very happy with this result,"" he says, having missed out on the front row while equaling his grid position of the season-opening Qatar Grand Prix. ""At the end of qualifying I was able to put in a hot lap, but the race tomorrow is going to be difficult and tough. I won't be 100% physically because I'm bruised and sore; my shoulder is bothering me the most and we will see how it responds tomorrow."" Marquez will start one place ahead of seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi, who had been third for Yamaha until he was bumped down the times late on. ""Unfortunately I have to start on the third row but I'm quite happy because my pace is quite good, so I think with a good start I can do a good race,"" said the Italian, who won seven times at Mugello between 2002-2008. American Nicky Hayden was eighth fastest on the second Ducati, with Spain's Alvaro Bautista rounding out the third row.","Dani Pedrosa snatches pole position from MotoGP world champion Jorge Lorenzo .

"(CNN) -- Former two-time world rally champion Carlos Sainz showed his pedigree by claiming the first special stage of the 2013 Dakar Rally in Peru Saturday,. Driving for team Buggy, the Spaniard completed the 13km leg from Peru's capital Lima in seven minutes 40 seconds. He had an eight-second advantage over Argentina's Lucio Alvarez, in a Toyota, with French driver Guerlain Chicherit, in an SMG, taking third. Sainz, who won the grueling endurance event in 2010, saw his team Qatari teammate, Nasser al-Attiyah, who was the 2011 champion, take fourth. Reigning title holder, Stephane Peterhansel of France, driving a Mini, took eighth place in the short sprint section, but was already one minute and 42 seconds adrift of the 50-year-old Sainz. Peterhansel claimed a remarkable 10th Dakar crown in last year's race, four in the cars and six in the motorcycle section. American NASCAR champion Robby Gordon made a disastrous start in his Hummer, coming to a halt on course and despite eventually restarting came in over 10 minutes down. Chile's Francisco Lopez, riding a KTM, took the honors in the motorcycle section with a clocking of seven minutes 51 seconds. He edged out Dutchman Frans Verhoeven on a Yamaha by a single second with Pablo Quintanilla of Chile third for Honda at five seconds. Last year's winner, Cyril Despres of France, who is bidding for a fifth Dakar crown, finished fifth on his KTM, 13 seconds back. The field of cars, motorcycles, quad bikes and trucks will be negotiating over 8,000 kilometers across Peru, Argentina and Chile before the finish on January 20 in Santiago.

"(CNN) -- Lotus have retained their controversial driver Romain Grosjean for the 2013 Formula One campaign. The Frenchman finished eighth in the drivers' championship in 2012 on 96 points but was involved in a number of early season incidents. He was handed a one-race ban after causing a pile up during the Belgian Grand Prix while Red Bull's Mark Webber called him a ""first lap nutcase"" after they collided at the Japanese Grand Prix. A decision on Grosjean's future was delayed until he held talks with the team at the end of the season but now they have confirmed he will again partner 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen. ""It's fantastic for me to be continuing with Lotus F1 Team for 2013,"" Grosjean told the Lotus website. ""It's superb to have the support of everyone at Enstone. I'm really looking forward to rewarding their faith when we take to the track in Australia. ""I learnt a lot in my first full season in Formula One and my aim is to put these lessons into practice with stronger and more consistent performance on track next year. ""There are a lot of exciting developments occurring behind the scenes at Enstone and I am very excited with the prospect of the E21 (car).

"(CNN) -- Authorities arrested Google's top executive in Brazil Wednesday after officials said he violated the South American country's election law when he didn't take down online videos that allegedly slandered a political candidate. An arrest warrant in the southwest state of Mato Grosso do Sul accuses Fabio Jose Silva Coelho, Google's president in Brazil, of ""disobedience"" for not removing YouTube videos about a local mayoral candidate. Federal police arrested Coelho Wednesday, but described the alleged crime as a ""minor offense"" and said he would be released on his own recognizance after signing a commitment paper to appear in court. CNN affiliate Band News reported that he had been released Wednesday evening. A Google spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In court documents, the company argues that it isn't responsible for the contents of the videos on the Google-owned YouTube site and asks for the case to be dismissed. Under Brazilian law, the penalty for disobeying a judge's order could be up to a year in prison, federal police said. Earlier this month, another company executive faced a similar order in the northern state of Paraiba for a video that allegedly slandered a mayoral candidate there. That case was dismissed after Google successfully convinced the judge that it was not responsible for the contents of the video but simply provided a platform for its diffusion. In August, Facebook faced an order to remove a page criticizing a political candidate or be forced to go dark in the country for 24 hours.

"(CNN) -- Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi survived a bombing targeting his motorcade on Monday in an upscale Damascus neighborhood, but the government and the opposition each reported casualties. ""The premier is safe,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said, citing an official government source. The incident occurred in a leafy swath of the Mezzeh district in southwest Damascus. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a group opposed to President Bashar al-Assad's government, also reported that the prime minister survived. The observatory said one of al-Halqi's escorts and five civilians were killed. Another escort and a driver were badly injured, the group said. SANA, which called the blast a ""terrorist explosion"" targeting al-Halqi's convoy, reported casualties but did not list details. The agency's website cited material damage and posted images of badly damaged cars and a person being carried away on a stretcher. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack, saying all violence in Syria must end. ""The targeting of civilians and civilian objects by anyone is unacceptable,"" a spokesman for his office said in a written statement. ""The secretary-general remains extremely worried at the continued escalation of violence in Syria, where civilians continue to be killed, injured, detained and abducted every day."" Mezzeh is strategically important because it is along a highway that connects to a major Syrian air force base. McCain: 'Angry and bitter' Syrians need America's help . It is also near Mount Mezzeh, the home of al-Assad's palace. For months, Syrian rebels have been trying to infiltrate Damascus in their attempt to oust al-Assad and end four decades of family rule. The civil war in Syria has killed more than 70,000 people, mostly civilians, over the past two years. Syria and chemical weapons . Russia sounded another warning Monday about the West's consternation about allegations that Syria has used chemical weapons. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov maintained it's ""unacceptable"" for countries to use the weapons of mass destruction issue in Syria to topple the al-Assad government. ""Perhaps there are some states that believe any methods are good as long as they can help overthrow the Syrian regime. However, the subject of the use of weapons of mass destruction is far too serious,"" he said, according to state-run RIA Novosti. ""I think it is unacceptable to use it, to speculate on it for geopolitical purposes."" RIA Novosti said Lavrov was commenting on American and British statements that chemical weapons may have been used in Syria. Rebels attack military airports across the country, opposition says . The foreign minister previously warned against a repeat of the ""Iraqi scenario"" in which claims that Saddam Hussein's government possessed so-called weapons of mass destruction were the basis of the U.S.-led invasion. He also said that international investigators were asking ""too much"" by demanding access to all facilities in Syria and to have the right to interview any Syrians. In a letter sent to lawmakers before Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced there was evidence that sarin was used in Syria, the White House said that intelligence analysts have concluded ""with varying degrees of confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale in Syria, specifically the chemical agent sarin."" President Barack Obama has said that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would cross a ""red line"" threshold for greater U.S. action in the country. The White House cautioned that the ""chain of custody"" of the chemicals was not clear and that intelligence analysts could not confirm the circumstances under which the sarin was used, including the role of al-Assad's regime. British Prime Minister David Cameron said that he supported Obama and that the use of chemical weapons should constitute a ""red line,"" the UK Press Association reported. But if a red line has been crossed, Cameron was less clear on what the next steps should be. Syria denies that it has used, or even possesses, chemical weapons, accusing the United States and Britain of lying in order to pressure the embattled Damascus government.

"(CNN) -- Britain will have four representatives on the Formula One grid next season after Marussia F1 announced they have signed Max Chilton for the 2013 campaign. The 21-year-old has completed just two F1 tests for the team and was their reserve driver for the final six races of 2012. Chilton's deal with Marussia means there will be a British quartet on the grid when the teams line up in Australia. He joins Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button, of McLaren, and Paul Di Resta, who drives for Force India. It is the first time there have been four Brits in F1 since 2008 when Button and Hamilton were joined by David Coulthard and Anthony Davidson. ""It's hard to put into words how I'm feeling today, with the announcement that I will be racing for the Marussia F1 Team in 2013,"" Chilton said in a statement on Marussia's official website. ""I am very fortunate to have spent the last six races with the Marussia F1 Team as reserve driver, which means that instead of a standing start, I am already up to speed and at ease with the people, the culture, the systems and of course, the 2012 package. ""During the period since the Japanese Grand Prix, I have watched at very close quarters the incredible commitment and determination to succeed that saw everyone in the team pushing until the very last race. ""I feel very lucky to be able to embark on my F1 racing career with this group of people. ""Pre-season testing is just a few weeks away, so my focus now is to continue my physical preparation whilst spending as much time as possible working with the technical team to help develop the car I will drive in my debut F1 season."" Chilton finished fourth in the GP2 series, which acts as a feeder competition for F1, and showed promise in his two performances in the Marussia car, in a young driver test and in free practice at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. John Booth, Marussia's team principal, said Chilton had shown enough potential to earn his chance, as Marussia try to improve on their 11th-place finish in last year's constructors' championship. ""We felt confident enough in his ability and potential to appoint him to the role of reserve driver in September and since that time his development has been rapid in all aspects,"" Booth explained. ""First and foremost, he has shown himself to be extremely capable in the car. Most recently, in Abu Dhabi, he was put to the test in a competitive environment which included providing him with an opportunity to demonstrate his outright pace and consistency over a single lap. ""Not only that, Max very quickly embedded himself within the team, thanks in no small part to the fact that he is a lively and affable character who we've enjoyed having around. ""Having been integral to our race weekend engineering environment for the past three months already - as well as having undertaken a significant part of our simulator programme - Max has already found his feet.""","Briton driver Max Chilton selected to drive for Marussia in the 2013 Formula One season .

"(CNN) -- With the two sides unable to come to contract terms, the NFL locked out its referees before the preseason began. Here are some of the issues that are on the table between the NFL, its 32 owners and the 121 officials. PAY . The money to pay officials comes from a pot of $18 million funded by the league. The NFL wants an increase in the average salary for officials, who are part-time employees, from $149,000 to $189,000 by 2018. Referees (the head officials) and officials who qualify for postseason games would make more, the league said. The raises each year would fall between 5% and 11%, the league said. The officials have asked for more, but have not publicly disclosed how much. They say the league, which has revenues of more than $9 billion per year, can afford it. NFL: Packers should have won . RETIREMENT PLAN . The league wants to switch from a pension plan to a 401k plan. The league said in a July statement: ""No game official will lose any vested pension benefit under our proposal and the clubs will fully fund all pension obligations."" But the executive director of the referees association said in an open letter to the media last week that plan would transfer long-term investment risk to the officials and would cut the league's financial obligation by 60%. Tim Millis said 18 of the league's teams have some form of defined-benefit program rather than a 401k system. The league said their plan will give the officials a larger retirement benefit. The officials have proposed that only new hires be moved to the 401k plan. SI: NFL Holds firm in negotiations . MORE RESERVE CREWS . According to Peter King of Sports Illustrated the league would like to add three crews of seven people in reserve with the option to use these referees to replace underperforming officials. That would add 21 officials to the pool and officials fear it would affect their job security. Referees are only paid for games worked, so anyone who was ""benched"" would lose pay. Chorus for NFL referees grows . FULL-TIME OFFICIALS . Right now each official works a full-time job and refs in his free time. Officials also have to watch game tape, file reports to the league office and take a weekly written test on the rules. One veteran referee told ESPN that all that, coupled with keeping in shape, takes 30 hours a week. The league wants to hire seven full-time officials and have them handle training and scouting. The officials' association has said it would OK with that, if the referees were paid a fair amount.

"(CNN) -- Germany's triple world champion Sebastian Vettel will continue to win titles even if he moves on from Red Bull, three-time world champion Niki Lauda has told CNN. On Sunday, the 25-year-old became the youngest triple world champion in the history of the sport becoming only the third driver to win three consecutive titles, following in the footsteps of racing legends Michael Schumacher and Juan Manuel Fangio. After winning this year's title when finishing sixth in Brazil's Interlagos to beat Ferrari's Fernando Alonso by three points, the German said he was 'extremely committed' to a team he is contracted to until the end of 2014. Nonetheless, Lauda says Vettel's quality is such that he will continue to beat the world's best when the inevitable happens and he moves on from Red Bull. ""He will eventually move somewhere else,"" said Lauda, who won his titles with both Ferrari (1975 and 1977) and McLaren (1984). ""It's normal. Any skier changes his skis every year -- so you have to change your cars at least once in your history. ""I changed my racing cars three or four times in my career and still kept on winning. He will do something like this for sure as well."" Vettel has been strongly linked with a move to Ferrari in recent months, although representatives at both Maranello and the Red Bull driver have tried to dampen the speculation. Since Lauda's last title, only three other drivers have won world championships with different manufacturers -- razil's Nelson Piquet (Brabham and Williams), Frenchman Alain Prost (McLaren and Williams) and Schumacher (Benetton and Ferrari). Lauda, who joined Mercedes as a non-executive chairman in September, believes that the Red Bull car's dominance has been key to Vettel's success. ""Vettel is the top guy, [Lewis] Hamilton is the top guy, Alonso is the top guy, Schumacher is a top guy too,"" Lauda. ""You need a car, and you need a driver. Vettel is for sure as good as Alonso is - but you need a better car."" Vettel's latest triumph was greeted with delight in Germany, with Chancellor Angela Merkel among those leading the plaudits -- praising the driver's 'fabulous strength of character'. Prior to the German's success on Sunday, the previous youngest driver to win three titles was the late Ayrton Senna -- who achieved the feat at the age of 31. Meanwhile, Williams have confirmed Venezuela's Pastor Maldonado and Valtteri Bottas of Finland as their driver pairing for the 2013 season. Bottas replaces Brazil's Bruno Senna, the nephew of the late three-time world champion Ayrton Senna. 'It has always been my life-long dream to compete in the Formula One world championship,"" the 23-year-old Bottas, a test driver for Williams in 2012, said in an official statement. ""To do so with one of the most legendary teams in the sport is incredibly special. I've really enjoyed my three years with Williams so far and feel very at home here so my goal was always to stay for 2013 and progress to a race seat. ""I'm looking forward to getting my Formula One career started and enjoying a lot of success with Williams."" Maldonado enjoyed a successful second season in the sport, picking up the first race win of his fledgling career at this year's Spanish Grand Prix.","Niki Lauda tips Sebastian Vettel to continue his title-winning success .

"(CNN) -- Sport's battle with racism and discrimination has suffered a further setback after a senior Australian administrator compared an athlete to ""King Kong."" Eddie McGuire, president of the Collingwood Australian Rules Football team, has apologized unreservedly after describing Adam Goodes, an indigenous Australian playing for the Sydney Swans, as an ideal person to promote the musical of the 1930s classic film. ""Get Adam Goodes down for it, do you reckon?"" McGuire, a businessman and TV presenter, said on the radio show he presents. ""You can see them doing that can't you? Goodsey,"" continued McGuire. ""You know with the ape thing, the whole thing, I'm just saying pumping him up and mucking around, all that sort of stuff."" McGuire, who will go through the Australian Football League's (AFL) Racial and Religious Vilification Policy, received the backing of the Collingwood board on Thursday. ""I apologize to Adam Goodes, to the Indigenous people of Australia and every Indigenous sportsperson,"" McGuire told a press conference. McGuire announced he would not be stepping down in light of the incident, with the board standing by a man they claim has ""led with distinction for almost 15 years."" ""I understand the questions surrounding my leadership but with the support of my fellow directors I remain committed to the Collingwood Football Club and all that it stands for,"" McGuire said in a Collingwood statement. Goodes tweeted a link to an article about McGuire's comment on the AFL's official website on Wednesday. ""Morning Australia this is what I have woken up to t #racismitstopswithme #bigweekinfooty,"" said the 33-year-old from his verified Twitter account. Racism in sport was again thrust into the limelight last week when golf was at the center of a discrimination storm. When asked if he would invite world No. 1 Tiger Woods to dinner during next month's U.S. Open, Spain's Sergio Garcia replied: """"We'll be having him round every night... and serving him fried chicken."" Woods, a 17-time major winner, described the comments as ""wrong, hurtful and inappropriate,"" with Garcia subsequently issued a full apology. Soccer has also been grappling with high-profile incidents of racism. Italy striker Mario Balotelli threatened to walk off the playing field after he was subject to ""monkey chants"" during AC Milan's recent match against Roma. European football's governing body UEFA recently announced a raft of new anti-discrimination sanctions. Players and officials found guilty of racism offenses will be hit with 10-match bans, while clubs whose fans breach discrimination rules will be subjected to part or complete closure of their stadiums.","An AFL team owner has apologized after comparing a player to King Kong .

"(CNN) -- The Los Angeles Kings finally have their name in lights. Their Stanley Cup triumph has lifted a weight from the shoulders of die-hard fans who have been pining for a championship trophy for 45 long years. The scrappy Kings grabbed the National Hockey League's prestigious Stanley Cup with a 6-1 win over the New Jersey Devils. Now La La Land is rolling out the red carpet for ice hockey's tenacious new champions, who won a long-elusive crown with Hollywood flair and reality-show grit. ""I have no words to describe this,"" one fan said. ""Other than my children being born and having graduated the Police Academy, this is the single most joyous day of my life."" Now, he says, he can scratch one more item off his ""bucket list."" ""The mountain has been climbed!"" For him and other Kings' fanatics across Southern California and in the team's growing and crazed diaspora, the championship -- the first for the Kings since they began play in 1967 -- ended decades of futility for a franchise struggling for success in a sport typically associated with frigid temperatures and icy lakes. ""We're No. 1!"" long-suffering Kings fans shouted as they streamed out of the Staples Center after the game on Monday night, undaunted by a heavy police presence. Others formed a mosh pit outside the arena, jumping and smashing into one another other in celebration. As of late Monday evening, Los Angeles police reported a few minor arrests but no major problems. The Die Hard Los Angeles Kings Fan Page on Facebook chronicled the rapture, relief and disbelief from the legions who've pulled for the team, as one fan put it, ""through thick and thin."" ""I love you My Boyzz,"" one elated fan said. Another didn't know if this was a Hollywood movie or reality: ""I still need to be pinched."" ""An amazing feeling,"" another fan said. ""Phew. Man. Just. Wow."" Once an afterthought in the city of showbiz and bright lights, the Kings reached the pinnacle of professional hockey in a region long dominated by the NBA's Lakers and Clippers, baseball's Dodgers and Angels, and football and basketball at UCLA and University of Southern California. The Kings have even been overshadowed by their crosstown Pacific Division rival, the Anaheim Ducks, which won the Stanley Cup in 2007 just 14 years after the franchise started. This year, Los Angeles just edged into the playoffs as the 8th and last seed in the NHL's Western Conference. Regarded as a solid and respectable team, chances appeared slim that the team would advance in the grinding post-season play that started two months ago. But the black-clad underdogs, led by goalie Jonathan Quick, slew Goliaths in several best-of-seven series on their way to glory. They humbled the Vancouver Canucks , a team that had scored 111 points in this year's regular season, the most in the league. Then the Kings swept the St. Louis Blues and overpowered the Phoenix Coyotes. They dominated the Devils, a three-time Stanley Cup champion, in the first three games of the series, but New Jersey, with great players such as Ilya Kovalchuk, Patrik Elias, and Zach Parise, didn't say die. After taking a 3-0 lead, the Devils beat the Kings in the next two games. For the Kings, the specter of losing the series after taking a 3-0 would have been a nightmare for a script that appeared headed to a happy ending. But the Kings rose to the occasion at the Staples Center on Monday night and blocked the Devils' dream of an upset. The pace of the game was set in the first period, when the Kings scored three goals during a five-minute power play in the first period after the Devils' Steve Bernier was ejected for boarding. That's when a player is pushed or checked violently into the boards of the rink. ""I'm probably going to watch the Kings Stanley Cup DVD everyday until next season starts,"" one person said on the Facebook fan page. Quick displayed his usual prowess, winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player during the playoffs. He outshone Devils' goalie legend Martin Brodeur in the finals, but he deferred credit for the Kings' success to the team. For example, Drew Doughty and Jeff Carter performed with power and flair. Darryl Sutter, longtime player and coach, took over as Kings' coach in December when the team was faltering, and he spurred the team to greater achievement. Captain Dustin Brown -- who hoisted the cup before a roaring home crowd at the Staples Center before the trophy passed from one screaming King to another -- was another cog in the Kings' wheel. ""You can't say enough about this group and how hard they worked,"" Quick said. ""I hope everyone realizes how amazing Quick is ... he had perhaps the best postseason ever for a goalie,"" a man on the fan page said. ""The Kings need to lock him up for the next 10 years !!!"" Champagne flowed freely in the Kings' locker room -- including into the Stanley Cup itself. The team reveled in the fact that it was the first-ever No. 8 seed and lowest seed in the modern era to win the NHL championship. The mood was much more somber in the Devils' locker room. ""I'm not the kind of player that wants to hurt this team, I want to help them,"" Bernier told reporters. ""They scored three goals in those five minutes."" In-depth Stanley Cup coverage at Sports Illustrated . The fan mania is a reminder of that the NHL is popular in the South and the West, not just in Canada and the icy northern U.S. states. The NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning, the Florida Panthers, the Dallas Stars, the Nashville Predators, the Carolina Hurricanes, and the San Jose Sharks sport popular franchises. In sunny Los Angeles, meanwhile, the high-pitched enthusiasm rippled through the palm trees. ""This is,"" one man told reporters. ""The best city for hockey."" The last time the Kings garnered this much attention back home was in the late 1980s and early 1990s, propelled by the league's all-time top scorer, Wayne Gretzky. ""So when are they gonna make the movie about our cup run???"" one Kings' fanatic said on the Facebook page. iReporters, share your thoughts on Monday's game .

"(CNN) -- Hot on the heels of the eight-year ban handed out to Mahmood Al Zarooni for drugging his race horses another bombshell could be set to hit the beleaguered sport. Trainer Gerard Butler, who runs the Egerton House Stables, has admitted to a British newspaper that he is facing a ban for injecting his thoroughbreds with anabolic steroids to treat injured joints after assurances from veterinary professionals. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) confirmed on their official website they are investigating Butler, who is also based in the English town of Newmarket, and that samples taken from his yard had tested positive. Just last week the BHA handed down an eight-year ban to Al Zarooni after 15 horses from the world famous Godolphin stables, owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, were found to have been given banned drugs. The 37-year-old Al Zarooni admitted a ""catastrophic error"" in administering the prohibited anabolic steroids -- ethylestranol and stanozolol -- to the animals, all of which have been banned from racing for six months. Butler told The Independent newspaper he thinks around 100 horses have been given the same drugs at the headquarters of British flat racing and called the incident ""an unpardonable misjudgement."" He said he had given four horses at his yard a product called Sungate, which is used to treat joints, but was so sure of its validity he entered it into his official medical records which were then sent to the BHA. ""It did not cross my mind that there could be any problem with this medication,"" he was quoted as saying by The Independent. ""And, judging from the fact that the BHA said nothing about it when they saw my medical book, it does not seem to have crossed their minds, either. ""Little Black Book ran on 4 August, and won a couple of weeks later, so they would have known he was clearly in training at the time. ""In the medical book, I signed that I had authorized use of the drug, and my vet had countersigned for its administration. Sungate had for some time been widely used in their practice, with very beneficial results for joint injuries."" Butler runs a small stable compared to the Godolphin outfit but has had success with Elusive City and Compton Admiral, while his small U.S based operation helped Pachattack finished third in one of the country's most prestigious fillies' races -- the Breeders' Cup. The BHA's statement read: ""In light of reports and speculation today, and because of recent events regarding horses formerly trained by Mahmood Al Zarooni, it is felt necessary to confirm that a separate investigation is being held into a number of positive samples obtained from horses at Gerard Butler's yard, following a testing in training visit on 20th February. ""While conscious of the need not to prejudice the outcome of the current inquiry, the investigation has established that the source of the positive samples was a veterinary product, licensed in the EU and legally imported for use by a veterinary practice, the initial administration of which was recommended by a vet. ""This investigation remains ongoing and a number other parties have been and will be interviewed, including representatives of the veterinary practice in question. One of the objectives of this investigation is to clarify the extent to which this product has been distributed and administered to horses in training. ""Immediately following the results of the testing in training, the BHA, in conjunction with the National Trainers Federation, notified trainers that the product in question contains an anabolic steroid and should not be used on any horse in training.""","Newmarket trainer admits he is facing a ban for injecting horses with anabolic steroids .

"(CNN) -- With Rory McIlroy, the world's second-ranked golfer, and defending champion Luke Donald not surviving the cut at the PGA Championship, the door was opened for others at the European Tour's flagship event. Spain's Alejandro Canizares took advantage, leading at Wentworth in England heading into the final day after registering a four-under 68 to move to nine-under 207 overall. Canizares, whose lone European Tour title came in Russia seven years ago, was forced to skip this month's China Open after being diagnosed with viral meningitis. ""I'm not at full strength but it's working for me, so I'm not going to complain,"" said Canizares, the son of Ryder Cup veteran Jose Maria Canizares. Matteo Manassero of Italy, at 20 bidding to become the youngest winner of the event, and Scotland's Marc Warren sit tied for third at seven-under, a shot better than Ireland's Shane Lowry. But it's the player in second, England's Lee Westwood, who might fancy his chances Sunday. Westwood, twice a runner-up at Wentworth, a Ryder Cup stalwart and the only member of the top five inside the top 50 in the world rankings, is a single shot behind Canizares. Westwood, who recorded a 67 in the third round, said it would be ""ironic"" if he won the title months after moving his family from England to Florida. Although not matching the weather in Florida, Saturday's conditions were significantly better than chilly Thursday and Friday. ""It would be great and I am after as many wins as I can get, but it's a crowded leaderboard and I will have to play as well, if not better than I did today,"" Westwood said. ""I felt much more in tune with my swing and had a lot better distance and direction control with my irons and set up a lot of chances. ""It was one of the most fun days I have ever had on a golf course. It was good to see a lot more smiling faces and a lot more people prepared to take their hands out of their pockets and applaud. ""I also get great support here but even more so today."" Another golfer that praised the spectators was Spain's Sergio Garcia. Garcia came under fire this week and issued an apology for his ""fried chicken"" jibe. He considered pulling out of the tournament. But Garcia played, made the cut and remains in contention, tied for sixth at five-under. ""The crowds here, I don't have words to explain what I feel towards them,"" Garcia, last a winner on the European Tour in 2011, said. ""They have been amazing, every single tee, every single green, cheering me on, and I can never pay them back."" Also tied for sixth is the halfway leader, Italian Francesco Molinari, who slumped to a 73 in the third round. Popular Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez, the oldest man in the event at 49, registered a 67 to rise to a tie for 14th at four-under. British Open champion Ernie Els, undone by bogeys on the first and third holes, could only manage a par 72 and fell six shots behind the leader.","Alejandro Canizares leads the PGA Championship heading into the final day .

"(CNN) -- German Norbert Haug is to step down as head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport after over 20 years in the position and a plethora of titles. Haug assumed the position in 1990 and the German manufacturer has since enjoyed success in a range of motorsport disciplines, including Formula One and Touring Cars. One of Haug's biggest achievements was to oversee Mercedes' rebirth as an F1 team in 2010 after 55 years out of the sport, though the team has only won one Grand Prix over the last two years. ""I would like to thank the best car company in the world for more than 22 years, which never had a single moment without passion for me,"" Haug said in a statement on the manufacturer's official website. ""Since 1991, we had tremendous achievements and wins, for which I want to thank all of my colleagues. Unfortunately, with one victory in 2012 since founding our own Formula One works team in 2010, we couldn't fulfil our own expectations. ""However, we have taken the right steps to be successful in the future. Our team and our drivers will do everything to achieve these goals."" Mercedes' F1 prospects for 2013 have been boosted by the arrival of 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton from the company's partner and fellow constructor McLaren, while triple world champion Niki Lauda will liaise between the board and the team in a non-executive director role. Hamilton will team up with Germany's Nico Rosberg, who picked up the marque's sole win of 2012 at April's Chinese Grand Prix, following the retirement of seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher. ""Norbert Haug was the face of the Mercedes-Benz Motorsport programme for more than 20 years,"" said Dr. Dieter Zetsche, head of Mercedes-Benz cars. ""For me, he put his stamp on a whole era and, as a highlight, he was responsible for the successful comeback of the Silver Arrows to Formula One."" During Haug's time at the helm, Mercedes-Benz has contributed to six F1 world championship triumphs -- five for McLaren and one for Brawn GP, which Mercedes-Benz purchased in 2009. In DTM, a German touring car competition, Mercedes has clinched 32 titles since Haug took over, winning 54% of all DTM races.","Norbert Haug steps down as head of Mercedes-Benz motorsport .

"New Orleans (CNN) -- In a small gun range 20 minutes outside New Orleans, a steady stream of gun enthusiasts fill the air with the scent of gunpowder and the sharp bang of shots. Many of the customers -- a range of ex-military men, off-duty law enforcement officers and a sprinkling of women learning how to handle a firearm for self-protection -- said they have grown up around guns and are leery of interference by the federal government on gun rights. ""Just like drug use is illegal but people still get their hands on drugs -- so, the bad guys are still going to have guns,"" said Meredith Timberlake, who came from a family of Marines. ""Well, I'm going to have a gun too."" Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-Louisiana) is well aware of those concerns. The veteran Democrat will face her states' voters in a 2014 election, and despite her three terms in the Senate, Landrieu's seat is widely considered vulnerable. CNN Poll: Importance of guns soars, as do gun owner concerns . She has already drawn a Republican challenger, who has worked to tie Landrieu to the policies of President Barack Obama and charged she does not represent the views of many in this deeply red Southern state. Landrieu, in an interview with CNN during a small business event in Boston, emphasized her independence from Washington. Despite the president's aggressive support for expanding background checks for gun purchasers, Landrieu said she has not decided whether she'll support a Senate bill on the matter. Background checks on gun sales: How do they work? When asked about recent polls finding 90% of Americans support universal background checks, Landrieu said: ""I don't know what the number is in Louisiana."" ""I'm not the president of the United States, I'm the senator from Louisiana,"" Landrieu said. ""So I really will follow what the people in my state want me to do on that issue."" Landrieu said she wouldn't weigh in on background checks ""until I see the bills and then I'll decide how I'm going to vote. But there's no question about my support for the Second Amendment."" CNN Poll: Background checks popular, worrisome . Months after the massacre of elementary school students in Newtown, Connecticut, there is intense pressure for Congress to address gun violence. A third-party group, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's Mayors Against Illegal Guns, has rolled out an ad in Louisiana urging Landrieu to support new gun legislation. The group has also directed spots at other lawmakers on the fence about reforms, including several other Democrats up for re-election in 2014. And there are some signs that a bill like one announced by a bipartisan group of senators Wednesday on background checks may be more palatable to voters. A Quinnipiac poll released in early April found 91% of voters across the country support universal background checks. ""I think we should be doing that anyway. I think that's part of our responsibility,"" said Keith Moody, a former Marine who works in law enforcement and supports expanding the background check system. ""I think responsible gun owners would agree that's a reasonable request that our government or local law enforcement put on us. When you start going past that is when I think people get nervous about it or have strong feelings one way or the other,"" Moody said. Before the play date, the gun talk . As the Senate prepares to consider gun legislation as early as Thursday, Landrieu will have to cast a vote. ""If there is a lot of support and we can get background checks done and not infringe on the right of people to own guns or to pass them down to their children or grandchildren, we'll figure out a way to do that,"" Landrieu said. ""I do know that people in Louisiana want the right to own a gun and feel that it's, you know, part of our culture and history, and we're not going to infringe upon that right.""","Sen. Mary Landrieu is a conservative Democrat representing the red state of Louisiana .

"(CNN) -- Pablo Sandoval's record-tying three home runs led the San Francisco Giants to an 8-3 victory over the Detroit Tigers in Game 1 of the World Series. Barry Zito gave up just one run in 5 2/3 innings to earn the win for San Francisco. He also had a run-scoring single in the fourth inning. Tigers pitching ace Justin Verlander only managed to go four innings, allowing five runs on six hits. Sandoval, who had 12 home runs during the regular season, hit a solo home run in the first and a two-run shot in the third off Verlander. In the fifth, he added another home run off Al Alburquerque. He has six home runs in the postseason. ""In this situation you're going to face the best. For me I just go in there and don't thinking too much or try to do too much, get a pitch you can hit, take advantage of the mistakes he be making. That's a part of my game."" Sandoval said. His manager said Sandoval has been swinging the bat well for weeks. ""He's been locked in for a while, and the home runs, really where he hit them, too, it's not easy to hit them where he hit them,"" Giants skipper Bruce Bochy said. Three other players have homered three times in one World Series game. Babe Ruth did it twice, and Reggie Jackson also achieved the feat. Last year, St. Louis Cardinals slugger Albert Pujols had three home runs in Game 3. Sandoval broke his bat on his third home run. ""I used that bat all postseason,"" he said, adding he wasn't very superstitious. ""There's more bats in there to swing. It's not the bat. It's you. It's everything you've got inside you. If you have faith, you have to believe in yourself."" He also singled in the bottom of the seventh. ""I think you start with giving the Giant hitters credit,"" Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. ""They did a good job. They're very pesky, and obviously the big guy had one of those unbelievable nights that happens once in a while in a World Series. What a night for him."" The Giants led 8-1 going into the top of the ninth before the Tigers' Jhonny Peralta hit a two-run homer off George Kontos. Marco Scutaro had two RBI singles for the Giants, who will host Game 2 at 8:07 p.m. ET Thursday. Doug Fister is scheduled to be the starting pitcher for Detroit, facing off against San Francisco's Madison Bumgarner.","Giants take a 1-0 lead in World Series with 8-3 win .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel described his achievement of claiming a third successive Formula One crown in the country of racing legend Ayrton Senna as 'unreal'. The Red Bull driver became the youngest ever triple world champion in the history of the sport after recovering from a disastrous start to finish sixth at the Brazilian Grand Prix. Brazilian favourite Senna, who won his home Grand Prix in 1990 and 1991, was also a three-time world champion before his tragic death following a crash at Imola in 1994. Victorious Vettel makes history . Senna, who died at the age of just 34, won 41 races in 161 attempts and established himself as one of the most talented drivers to have ever graced the sport. Vettel, 25, is just the third driver in history to win three successive titles, equaling the achievements of Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio and Germany's Michael Schumacher. He now joins the likes of Senna, Nelson Piquet, Niki Lauda, Jackie Stewart and Jack Brabham on three championship triumphs. Unreal . ""To do this, for all of us in the team it is unreal,"" he told reporters. ""Also to win a third title here, where one of the greatest Ayrton (Senna) came from. ""It is very difficult to imagine that I join him and other great names by winning three successive titles. ""My radio was not working, I was crying and you didn't hear that and I am very happy about that. I just can't find the right words to describe how I feel right now. ""Christian (Horner) came on the radio and told me the names of all the three-time champions and I cried."" Tears . For much of the race it appeared that Vettel would be shedding different kind of tears following a nightmare start to the race. The German was involved in an opening lap collision with Williams' Bruno Senna, which damaged his car and left him at the back of the grid. Fangio vs. Senna: Who is the greatest? With his chief rival Fernando Alonso claiming second place, Vettel somehow managed to fight his way up to a sixth place finish to win the title by just three points. He added: ""I just kept trying to race. We always believed. ""I was so very happy to climb back after being hit like that at the start -- you imagine spinning backwards on the M25 (British motorway). It was not a very comfortable feeling. ""I really want to thank everyone in the team here and in the factory and all of us. Nobody feels more important than anybody else. It is unbelievable for me. ""I had to avoid everyone and I was lucky nobody hit me. Fortunately, the front wing was intact which was important. I was forced back and in the mixed conditions I was the slowest car out there on the straight. ""We just did our thing. That's the way we do it and it works in our team.""","Sebastian Vettel wins his third consecutive Formula One title .

"(CNN) -- More used to walloping cricket balls than opponents, Andrew Flintoff successfully swapped batting gloves for boxing gloves on Friday night beating American opponent, Richard Dawson in their heavyweight fight at the Manchester Arena, England. Despite being knocked to the floor in the second round, the former England cricketer recovered to win on points (39 to 38) in the four-round bout witnessed by a 5,000-strong crowd which included former teammates Steve Harmison and Rob Key. ""As a personal achievement, this tops the lot,"" Flintoff said. ""The crowd made a massive difference tonight. I'll appreciate I was sloppy at times, but it was a humbling moment."" Flintoff, who entered the ring wearing the shirt of his county cricket club Lancashire, had the better of the exchanges in the opening round, but was knocked to the canvas by the 23-year-old Dawson during the second. The 34-year-old was quick to recover though and made the referee's count comfortably before going on to dominate the final two rounds and secure the points victory. Flintoff announced his intentions to start boxing professionally in September and trained with former Irish world featherweight champion Barry McGuigan and his son Shane in preparation for his first fight. But his decision has caused controversy. British boxing promoter Frank Warren, whose BoxNation channel showed the fight, said in September that it would be ""car-crash television,"" while Frank Maloney, who managed former world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, described the bout as ""dangerous nonsense."" Despite a successful start, Flintoff remains uncertain about his future in the sport saying he will delay a decision until the new year. ""I want some time off, have a nice Christmas. After Christmas I will start to decide what to do. It is quite fresh, still quite raw what happened."" Flintoff maybe unsure what course to take, but many may agree with the comments of his friend and fellow paceman Steve Harmison. ""Great win @flintoff11!!!"" Harmison tweeted, ""But please don't do it again mate!!!"" Flintoff played 79 Tests and 141 One-Day Internationals for England in an international career spanning 11 years and was a key member of England's Ashes-winning teams against Australia in 2005 and 2009.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Indian cricket authorities have announced plans to host Pakistan later this year for the first one-on-one series between the South Asian rivals in five years. ""It was decided to resume cricketing ties with Pakistan by inviting the Pakistan cricket team for a short series in December 2012-January 2013,"" the Indian cricket board said in a statement Monday. ""The modalities will be worked out shortly."" India and Pakistan suspended their peace process and cricketing ties after the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai. The assault, which left more than 160 people dead, was blamed on Pakistani militants. The two nuclear neighbors have in the past used cricket as a platform to ease relations. Last year, then-Pakistan prime minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani watched a Cricket World Cup match between the two nations with his Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh as part of efforts to rebuild trust broken off by the Mumbai siege. In 2005, Singh and then-Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf saw a cricket game in a New Delhi stadium. In 1987, Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Pakistan Gen. Muhammad Zia ul-Haq attended a similar match in Jaipur. The last time the two sides played a head-to-head series was in 2007. Monday's announcement by the Indian cricket chiefs came after foreign secretaries of both nations emphasized earlier this month, at their meeting in New Delhi, the need to promote sporting contacts. Relations have thawed between India and Pakistan since they pledged last year not to let their talks unravel again over the range of thorny issues that put them at odds.","India and Pakistan to play international cricket again after five-year suspension .

"Boston (CNN) -- Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, lies in a hospital with a gunshot wound to the side of his neck, sedated and intubated, sources say. But he could be brought out of sedation in minutes so he could answer questions from law enforcement officials, doctors tell CNN. Intubated and sedated patients are often put on ""sedation holidays."" What we know about the suspects . Under normal circumstances, doctors use these holidays, which last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, so they can ask patients questions to assess neurological and cognitive functioning. The patients can't talk, since they have a tube down their throats, but they can write. ""They're still pretty out of it on these holidays, pretty confused and sleepy, but they could be able to understand what's being said to them,"" said Dr. Albert Wu, an internist and attending physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital. While many patients are groggy during these holidays, others are quite awake and thoughtful. Did one brother brainwash the other? Tsarnaev, who has been hospitalized since his capture on Friday, has been communicating with officials, two sources told CNN. ""They have been questioning him since yesterday,"" a senior law enforcement source said. ""There is some form of communication between law enforcement and the suspect."" Neither source would divulge what Tsarnaev has been communicating. Dr. Corey Siegel, a gastroenterologist and professor at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, remembers visiting his grandmother in the intensive care unit while she was intubated and sedated. Fearing she might be dying, he asked her physicians to decrease her sedation so he could have one last conversation with her. She still couldn't talk but she could write on a notepad. ""She woke up in five minutes and had a conversation. It was March, and she told me where her tax materials were so she could file her taxes,"" Siegel remembers. After a ""sedation holiday"" patients are put back under full sedation. ""It's like these patients are asleep,"" said Wu, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""They can't hold a conversation. They're really out of it."" Despite the sedation, some patients do respond a bit to what's going on around them. They might, for example, grunt if a doctor taps them on the shoulder or says their name. ""They might squeeze your hand in response to a command or move their heads to a sound, but they can't answer questions,"" said Dr. Athos Rassias, associate professor of anesthesia and critical care at Dartmouth. Doctors sedate intubated patients because it's uncomfortable and painful to have a tube down the throat and a machine forcing air into the lungs.

"(CNN) -- He's known as ""The Little Master"" and now Sachin Tendulkar can lay claim to being the only man in cricket history to reach 100 international centuries. The Indian batsman, who is the highest Test run scorer of all time, achieved the unprecedented feat during a one-day international against Bangladesh on Friday -- having been stuck on 99 hundreds for 33 innings. Tendulkar, who is revered in his home country and regarded as one of the finest batsmen ever to play the sport, looked to the heavens and kissed the Indian badge as he reached the landmark figure. His 100th century was his 49th in one-day matches, to add to his 51 Test hundreds. It was also his first one-day century against minnows Bangladesh. He was eventually dismissed for 114. Writing on The Wall: Indian legend Rahul Dravid retires . ""I was not thinking about the milestone. It hasn't sunk in,"" Tendulkar told the host broadcaster after his historic knock. ""A year ago when I got my 99th hundred the media began talking about it. Everybody began asking me about that. It began (to get a) little difficult. I was not playing for my 100th hundred. ""I have lost about 50 kilos. Enjoy the game and chase your dreams. I had to wait for 22 years for one dream, the World Cup."" Despite Tendulkar's heroics, Bangladesh eventually scored an upset victory in the Asia Cup match by five wickets. Chasing India's 289 for five wickets, openers Tamim Iqbal and Jahurul Islam put on 113 for the second wicket. Man-of-the-match Shakib Al-Hasan (49) and Nasir Hossain (54) kept the scoring rate high, but Bangladesh still needed 46 runs off the last five overs. Skipper Mushfiqur Rahim saw them home with 46 not out off 25 balls, including three sixes. It took only a little gloss off the earlier milestone for 39-year-old Tendulkar, who is India's most high-profile sporting icon in a country where cricket is a religion. His century provoked an outpouring of joy on home soil after a long wait. Legendary Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan took to Twitter to say: ""India breathes normally! Sachin completes an incredible feat! A hundred 100's. Never done before, perhaps never after!"" Tendulkar made his debut for India in a Test match against Pakistan back in 1989 when he was just 16 and, despite being hit in the mouth by a ball from fast bowler Waqar Younis, he batted on in a blood-soaked shirt. His first hundred in international cricket came as a 17-year-old in a match against England and by the time he turned 25 he already had compiled 16 centuries. Tendulkar became the first man to reach 50 centuries in 2000 and surpassed West Indian batsman Brian Lara's record for the highest number of Test runs in 2008. His current total of 33,854 runs in international cricket has cemented his status as a pioneer of the modern game and his enthusiasm for the game still burns bright as he prepares to turn 39 in April.

He has made India proud. ""Tendulkar's long career has been a triumph of class, character and courage. I wish him many more innings and feats to continue inspiring the youth.""

But since then he has failed to bring up three figures on India's tours of England and Australia as well as the home series against the West Indies -- twice being dismissed in the 90s.

"(CNN) -- What has been made clear by current events and financial upheavals since 2008 is that the global economy has become truly that -- global. The near meltdown we experienced a few years ago made it clear that our economic health depended on dependence on each other to do the right thing. Davos 2013: New year, same old problems? We are now closer to having an economic community in the best sense of the term -- we work with each other for the benefit of all. I think we've all become aware of the fact that our cultures and economics are intertwined. It's a complex mosaic that cannot be approached with a simple formula for the correct pattern to emerge. In many ways, we are in unchartered waters. The good news, in one respect, is that what is done affects us all. There won't be any winners or losers as this is not a competition. It's a time for working together for the best of all involved. Never before has the phrase ""we're all in this together"" had more resonance or relevance. Quest: U.S. economy to dominate Davos 2013 . My concern is that the negligence of a few will adversely affect the majority. I've long been a believer in the ""look at the solution, not the problem"" theory. In this case, the solution is clear. We will have to leave borders behind and go for global unity when it comes to financial stability. Is this possible? Is this a new frontier? Yes and no. There is the fait accompli strategy -- stay under the radar -- and the passive aggressive strategy, acts of terror used to paralyze and so on -- so the bottom line must be balance. Rationality must rule. There are philosophical approaches to economics. However, at this point, we don't so much need philosophy as we need action. Which way to proceed is the question. Defterios: Why Egypt's transition from its Arab Spring is so painful . You ask about Europe in crisis as an opportunity for investment. I see the world in crisis at the moment. I'm a firm believer that there are always opportunities whether the markets or up or down, but it requires insight and sometimes creativity to see those opportunities. I have no doubt that the balance we need will be achieved, but it won't happen overnight. Europe is a tapestry that is dense, colorful and deserving of continued longevity and prosperity. There are many pieces that must be carefully fitted together in order to thrive. Read more: Election season bluster: A Trump call for 'revolution!' Our challenge is to acknowledge those pieces and to see how they can form a whole that works together well without losing any cultural flavor in the process.

I am proud to have built a great golf course in Scotland after searching throughout Europe for five years for the right location. I've seen many beautiful places.

"London (CNN) -- For a moment, the nervous chatter, rustling costumes and jovial jostling came to a standstill. Silence fell over the 36,000 competitors who just minutes earlier had been impatiently rearranging themselves for the start of the London Marathon. For 30 aching seconds the spring sunshine beat down on their bowed heads, a sea of black ribbons pinned to their chests, as they remembered those who never got a chance to cross the finish line. It was a deeply tender and haunting image, and unlike anything ever seen in the 32-year-history of the race. Then again, this wasn't just another London Marathon. Six days after Boston's Marathon was rocked by the bombing which killed three people and injured more than 180, the English capital hosted its own premier race. READ MORE: Tight security at London Marathon . London is the first international marathon to follow Boston, and the attack which sent thousands of people scrambling in terror down smoldering streets and past upturned stands. It loomed large in the minds of competitors observing the silence ahead of the starting gun. ""Marathon-running is a global sport. It unites runners and supporters on every continent in pursuit of a common challenge and in the spirit of friendship and fellowship,"" event commentator, Geoff Wightman, announced over loudspeakers before the half-minute silence. ""This week the world marathon family was shocked and saddened by the events at the Boston Marathon. In a few moments a whistle will sound and we will join together in silence to remember our friends and colleagues for whom a day of joy turned into a day of sadness."" WATCH: Boston wheelchair racer in London . Among the runners, there was a humbling sense of how easily the Boston victims could have been themselves. There was also a determination to complete the race -- as much for their own gratification as for those who couldn't. For every competitor who crossed the finish line, organizers will donate $3 to The One Fund Boston, set up to raise money for victims of the blasts. Along with the usual whacky costumes -- a man dressed in an Abraham Lincoln hat and beard earned respect both for his bravery and lunacy -- were reminders of Boston's tragedy. Almost everyone wore black solidarity ribbons, with many also donning customized t-shirts bearing the name ""Boston."" Northern Irishman Barry McCann was one such runner. The 27-year-old from Belfast was working with his asset management company in Boston last week when the attack rocked the city. ""It was pretty much carnage, the whole place was in lockdown,"" he told CNN. ""Everyone has been so generous sponsoring us. It totally makes you more determined to show them [the bombers] that terrorism doesn't work."" Dressed in a stars and stripes t-shirt, 62-year-old Bill Higgins, from Fullerton, California, fought back tears as he talked about the impact of the Boston bombings on the international racing community. This was Higgins' 84th marathon and he said he had been inundated with people offering to sponsor his race. ""I've run Boston three times and the attack really hit home,"" he told CNN. ""People keep emailing me saying 'Never back down,' and 'No fear.'"" American Greg Takacs, 36, ran in the Boston Marathon last week and was proudly wearing his Boston race shirt adorned with black ribbons in respect to the victims. Describing the 30-second silence at the start of the race, he told CNN: ""It was so silent and very moving. It gave me goosebumps. ""For that many people to be that quiet -- It was incredible. Wow."" Friends John O'Flynn and John Gately, from Cork in Ireland, have family in Boston and were not planning on competing in London. But then last week's bombing changed their minds. ""The bombings made me disappointed in humanity,"" Gately told CNN. ""I do a lot of marathons and there is a huge solidarity here today."" Similarly, British runner Kristen Harrison, 24, wore a t-shirt with the slogan ""For Boston,"" as she prepared to compete in her fifth marathon. ""I wanted to support them,"" she told CNN. ""The running community is quite strong and I think we were all in shock after what happened. ""When you start hitting that wall, I think it will help to think of them."" WATCH: Suspects' uncle tells of familial break . Crowds were out in force as the marathon wound its way past some of London's most iconic landmarks such as Tower Bridge, St Paul's Cathedral and Westminster, before finishing near Buckingham Palace. ""The best way for us to react is to push ahead with the marathon, to get people on the streets and to celebrate it as we always do in London -- and to send a very clear message that we won't be cowed by this sort of behavior,"" Sport Minister Hugh Robertson had earlier told the BBC. There was also a strong police presence with 40% more officers on duty in the wake of Monday's bombings. As an extra security measure, litter bins were also removed from the 42-kilometer route. This is the city which nine months earlier hosted the Olympic Games without incident, and politicians say it provided the ideal training ground for hosting international sporting events. At the heart of the competition were ordinary people slogging it out in one of the most grueling races of its kind in the world -- and all for charity. As British journalist Marina Hyde wrote this week: ""The Boston bombers served only to remind the world that marathons are something in which we all have a stake."" The message, on this sundrenched Sunday, was loud and clear: ""We are in it together."" The first woman to cross the finish line was the winner of the Boston Marathon women's wheelchair race, U.S. athlete Tatyana McFadden, who repeated her feat at the London Marathon. The winner of the men's wheelchair race was Australia's Kurt Fearnley, and the winning runner in the men's elite race was Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia. The first-placed runner in the elite women's event was Priscah Jeptoo of Kenya. Fellow countrywoman Edna Kiplagat came in second.

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga says his country will not negotiate with al Qaeda-linked Somali militants who have threatened to kill Kenyan hostages unless Nairobi releases all Muslims charged with terrorism. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Odinga told CNN's John Defterios that his government's position was ""very clear."" ""We do not want to negotiate with terrorists,"" he said. ""We expect them to surrender Kenyan citizens who they are holding hostage without any kind of conditions whatsoever."" Al-Shabaab, the Islamist terror organization which controls parts of neighboring Somalia and is being pursued by Kenyan and African Union forces, issued the demands on Wednesday when it released a video of two Kenyan hostages seized a year ago in a cross-border raid. The group demanded that Nairobi release all Muslims held on terror charges, and secured the release of Muslims held in Uganda on similar charges. Odinga said that terrorism was an ""international affair,"" and that a collective response was required from the global community to tackle terror groups on the continent such as Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram in Nigeria and Islamists in northern Mali. ""The African Union must have a common stand and mobilize the African governments to provide the forces to face this international menace, working together with the United States and the European countries,"" he said. Odinga, the leading candidate in Kenya's upcoming March presidential elections, told CNN he did not anticipate a repeat of the violence which wracked the country after the previous vote, which saw hundreds killed and damaged the economy. He said the country had a new constitution, electoral commission and electoral laws and reformed the judiciary and security forces. ""The situation right now is ... different from what it was five years ago."" He said his focus, if elected, would be on building the country's productivity, and diversifying an economy predicted by the IMF to grow 5.6% this year.","Kenya will not negotiate with Al-Shabaab militants holding Kenyans hostage, says PM .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo warmed up for next week's ""Clasico"" double-header as Spanish soccer rivals Barcelona and Real Madrid labored to victories on Saturday. Messi scored for the 15th successive league match as Barca came from behind to beat Sevilla and move 12 points clear of second-placed Atletico Madrid. The four-time world player of the year took his tally to 38 in the league this season from 25 matches, and 49 overall, as he combined well with second-half substitute Cristian Tello to slot a 60th-minute winner. David Villa had marked his return to action with a 52nd-minute equalizer, heading home Dani Alves' cross. The striker had missed the midweek Champions League defeat by AC Milan due to his problem with kidney stones. Another shock defeat had seemed on the cards when Sevilla exposed Barca's frailties at the back three minutes before halftime, as former La Masia academy defender Alberto Botia headed home a cross. Barca did not include Eric Abidal in the squad, though the French defender was on Thursday cleared to make his long-awaited comeback following a liver transplant. Earlier Saturday, Ronaldo came off the bench to help earn a 2-1 victory for Real against bottom club Deportivo la Coruna. Coach Jose Mourinho had made seven changes following last weekend's win over Rayo Vallecano, ahead of Tuesday's second leg of the Spanish Super Cup at Barca's Camp Nou. It was Deportivo who took the lead as Riki beat Diego Lopez at the near post with a shot the goalkeeper should have blocked. It took a moment of magic from Kaka for Real to draw level with 17 minutes to play, as the Brazil midfielder curled in a right-foot shot to bring back memories of his days as one of the world's best players. Kaka, who started the match, was also involved in the 88th minute winner, splitting the Deportivo defense with a pass that allowed Ronaldo to square into the path of Gonzalo Higuain. The Argentina striker was untroubled in netting his 100th La Liga goal for Real in 179 appearances. ""From the first minute of the second half we saw a change of attitude,"" Mourinho's assistant Aitor Karanka told reporters. ""We didn't win because of the substitutions, which were made in the 12th minute of the second half, but because of the change we made. It was the attitude of all the players that sparked the comeback."" It is a big 10 days for third-placed Real, who host Barca in La Liga next Saturday before traveling to England for the second leg of the Champions League last-16 clash with Manchester United. Both Spanish Cup and European ties are finely balanced at 1-1. ""It was a difficult match, it was an uphill struggle for us from the first minute, but we had to demonstrate that we wanted to win and we were able to do that,"" Higuain said. ""We are excited and we want to play because we know that in a week we are playing to stay in the Copa and the Champions."" Valencia missed the chance to move above fourth-placed Malaga, needing to come from 2-0 down at struggling Real Zaragoza as Brazilian winger Jonas netted both goals to earn a draw. Getafe moved up to ninth, winning 3-1 at second-bottom Real Mallorca thanks to two late goals from striker Adrian Colunga.","Lionel Messi scores his 49th goal this season as Barcelona come from behind to beat Sevilla .

"(CNN) -- The most powerful man in African football wants much tougher penalties for racist behavior but has told CNN that abused players should not take the law into their own hands and walk off. Issa Hayatou, who is a member of FIFA's executive committee, said those responsible were ""shaming the human race"" but that whatever the provocation it was better to rise above it by showing quality on the football pitch. ""It might not be a solution to leave the field. It's a gut reaction really. It's very bad for a player,"" he said. ""You must play beautiful soccer and help your team score goals and this will show really the equality between white and black and it would put an end to the problem. ""So I believe that to leave the field is not enough. It's better to stay, make more effort, resist this insult and show that you are capable of doing very good things."" Hayatou's remarks come in the aftermath of a walk off by AC Milan's Kevin Prince Boateng -- subjected to racist abuse while playing a friendly match against a lower division side in Italy. He said he was sympathetic to Boateng's plight and wants far stiffer penalties to be applied. ""FIFA is doing a lot in order to get rid of racism in football and there are also international organizations, like the United Nations, who are also doing everything to get rid of racism. So what will we do? ""We will do everything. I believe only small fines are not enough. We need to find other punishments in order to deter these people who are shaming the human race,"" he added. Hayatou has been president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) since 1987 and unsuccessfully challenged Sepp Blatter for the presidency of FIFA in 2002. He wants the world governing body, led by Blatter, to take a ""collective decision"" to deal with the racism problem, but believes match fixing offers an even greater threat. ""It's just as negative as racism but I would say match fixing is even more negative because it's very, very bad and we mustn't know who is going to win,"" he said. ""So, for me, the worst thing in football is a match that is fixed."" Hayatou, 66, will be putting himself up for election for his seventh spell as CAF chief in Morocco next month, having overseen an Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa which was claimed by Nigeria with a 1-0 win over Burkina Faso in Sunday's final.","Africa football chief against player walk offs in racist incidents .

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- Walk the halls of Davos and you're bound to bump into celebrities, heads of state and even princes and princesses. This is where you can be seen, be heard and be indulged. The World Economic Forum's little white book which provides contacts for each attendee is the best business bible around. But you don't need to hang around the halls or wait to stake out your favorite executive to get their contact. The best way to network here is to take the shuttle. It's free, it's warm and -- being Swiss -- it always arrives on time. Inside, the six-seater bus has been made for interaction, with passengers facing each other. With eye to eye contact and closed doors, they are forced to engage in conversation. I have been taking the shuttle since Saturday, and on each occasion, I have made small talk with the passengers. Of course, I am always the one to instigate it, but it does just take one person to get the conversation flowing. On Wednesday night, post dinner, I met the Dean of the Said Business school in Oxford. Last night, I was lucky to start a conversation with the head of Standard & Poor's. The beauty of the shuttle is that no one knows anyone, so conversation normally begins with ""Are you enjoying Davos? When did you get here?"". Midway through the journey, if you're lucky enough to be stuck in traffic, then will you get into the most important question: ""What do you do?"". That's when I smile and they frown. I get excited that I have met a CEO, a vice president or the head of an NGO. They are disappointed that I'm a journalist. I'm quick to tell them that I'm not working and that everything is off the record. In cases such as this, when you have all of five minutes, it's crucial that you show your journalistic integrity and present them with a picture of a person rather than a journalist. I always think to myself: ""Don't force it, be natural."" This attitude has enabled to me make more contacts than on any other occasion. During a half hour shuttle journey on Thursday, I met a New York hedge fund manager, the chairman and CEO of Bayer, the VP of a Norwegian bank and many many more fascinating people. In true traditional networking style, they exit with well wishes and all, without exception, hand out their business cards. So forget LinkedIn -- come to Davos and the shuttle.","The six-seater shuttle buses at Davos are the best way to meet fellow attendees .

"(CNN) -- About to play Manchester United in the Champions League as the competition moves to its knockout phase, Real Madrid landed the first punch on their English rivals after the Spanish team became the first club in any sport to pass the €500 million ($650.5 million) revenue mark in a single year, according to the annual Football Money League table. United was left lagging in third place with revenues of $502.4 million, just under $111 million behind Real's arch rivals Barcelona ($613 million), as La Liga secured a one-two finish in a financial report produced by accountants Deloitte that does not take into account a club's debt in its calculations. The Spanish giants' dominance in the football finance stakes comes despite the perilous state of Spain's economy, in recession since 2009 with unemployment currently hovering at around 25%, according to the country's labor ministry. Real, which has spent heavily in recent years in acquiring some of the world's leading players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Mesut Ozil and Angel Di Maria, won the domestic title last season and is chasing a record 10th title in the Champions League. It is not often that United -- who lead the English Premier League by five points -- finish in third, though a raft of recent financial deals could give next season's Football League table a very different complexion. ""Manchester United continue to successfully leverage their global brand,"" Austin Houlihan, Senior Manager in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said in a statement. ""The new world-record seven-year shirt sponsorship deal with General Motors will double the revenues the club receives from its shirt partner in the first season of the new deal in 2014/15. ""This combined with new Premier League broadcast deals from 2013/14, which will deliver incremental distributions of between £20 million ($31.7 million) and £30 million ($47.5 million) per club, will help Manchester United push the two Spanish clubs above them, for a top two ranking,"" added Houlihan. ""Indeed the new Premier League deals could mean that half of the Money League top 20 are represented by English clubs in a few years' time."" For the fifth year in a row the clubs the Money League's top six clubs remained the same, with Bayern Munich in fourth, followed by Chelsea, with Arsenal in sixth. Revenue among the top 20 grew 10% on the previous year to reach $6.37 billion. ""It is an impressive achievement for Real Madrid to have surpassed €500 million in revenue in a single year,"" said Dan Jones, Partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte. ""Real has led the way in the phenomenal rate of revenue growth achieved by the game's top clubs, with the double digit (10%) increase by the top 20 clubs representing continued strong performance in these tough economic times. ""The combined revenues of the top 20 clubs have quadrupled since we began our analysis in 1996/97. ""While eight of the top 20 clubs experienced a drop in revenue in 2011/12, in most cases this was due to less successful on-pitch performances in European club competitions, rather than wider recessionary impacts."" English champions Manchester City is the joint highest climber after moving up to seventh in the table, while FIFA World Club champions Corinthians of Brazil are the highest placed non-European club with revenues of $123.7 million. The club's Premier League title win and its participation in the Champions League saw a 51% revenue growth to $452.6 million, the largest absolute and relative growth of any Money League club. ""The club's progress to the top of the English and European game means that they are set to remain a top 10 Money League club for the foreseeable future, and will look to push on ahead of the two English clubs immediately above them in the Money League, Arsenal and Chelsea, for a top five ranking,"" said Houlihan. There is also good news for German club Borussia Dortmund, up to 11th from 16th, while Italy's Napoli climbed five places to 15th following its Champions League exploits last season. There is only one new entry into the top 20 which is Newcastle United, which replaces Spanish club Valencia. The English Premier League has seven representatives in the top 20 rankings, five of which come in the top ten. Fair play? Football clubs seek to beat financial offside trap . The likes of Everton, Aston Villa, Fulham and Sunderland are hovering just outside, but there is no doubt as to which club continues to dominate revenue within the EPL. Deloitte's Football Money League list is based on a club's revenue from match-day revenue, television broadcasting rights and commercial revenue. The need for clubs to maximize these three areas will become ever important with the introduction of financial fair play regulations by European governing body UEFA. The report does not take into account the amount of debt which has been accumulated by each club. According to an article published on the Real Madrid website on September 13 2012, ""Net debt fell by 26.5% totaling €124.7 million ($166 million), i.e. €45 million less than in the previous period."" Meanwhile, a report on the Barcelona's official website from June 2012 stated that the club had outstanding debts of €320 million ($426 million). Manchester United's gross debt fell to £359.7 million ($569.6 million) in the three months to 30 September 2012, down 17% on a year earlier, according to widespread media reports. Facing the prospect of being punished with heavy fines and barred from European competition, they are desperate to make sure that generated revenues are equal or greater than expenditure.","Real Madrid tops Deloitte's Football Money League table for eighth straight year .

"(CNN) -- A rampant Germany thrashed arch rivals England 4-1 in Bloemfontein to reach the quarterfinals of the 2010 World Cup. Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski took advantage of sloppy defending to give Germany a 2-0 lead before Matthew Upson headed in for England. Frank Lampard was denied an equalizing goal for England when the officials failed to spot that the ball had clearly crossed the line. But despite England coach Fabio Capello's claim that the controversy was the turning point, a far superior Germany ran away with the match in the second half, with Thomas Muller scoring twice on the break to inflict England's biggest ever World Cup defeat. ""I think we played well but then I was disappointed by the mistakes and they counter-attacked well,"" Capello told BBC Sport. Blog: It's time for goal-line technology . ""Germany is a big team and they played well -- we made mistakes, but the referee made a bigger one. This is football."" It was the first World Cup meeting between two of football's oldest foes since 1990, when West Germany beat England on penalties after a 1-1 draw. England's only previous victory had come in the 1966 final -- a 4-2 triumph at London's Wembley. Germany carved the game's first opening inside five minutes when a pass over England's defense found Mesut Ozil, whose shot was saved by the legs of David James. The same direct approach brought the opening goal after 20 minutes when a long punt downfield from Manuel Neuer sent Klose racing clear. The striker showed strength to hold off Upson and flick the ball past James with an outstretched right foot to post his 50th international goal and his 12th at World Cup finals. England's defenders were caught out of position again for Germany's second goal as Muller shifted the ball to Podolski, who slashed a left-footed shot into the far corner. Five minutes later, England got back in the game when Gerrard's cross was headed home by Upson. Then came the controversial moment when Lampard's strike from the edge of the penalty area struck the underside of the bar and bounced down about two feet over the goal-line, only for Uruguayan referee Jorge Larrionda and his assistants to fail to award a goal. Germany may feel the decision atones for 1966, when England were famously awarded a third goal even though Geoff Hurst's shot appeared to bounce down on the line. England looked the stronger side in early stages of the second half and Lampard rattled the bar with a free-kick. But then the German onslaught began as England's hopes were buried by two fine counter-attacking goals in three minutes. First Bastian Schweinsteiger teed up Muller to smash the third past James at his near post, and then Mesut Ozil crossed for the Bayern Munich winger to compound England's misery. Germany, who have now reached at least the quarterfinals at every World Cup since 1954, will face Argentina in the last eight on Saturday.","Germany crush arch rivals England 4-1 to reach World Cup quarterfinals .

Host side Sanfrecce Hiroshima beat New Zealand's Auckland City 1-0 to earn a quarterfinal clash with African champions Al Ahly of Egypt, but the result will remain a footnote to FIFA's ""revolution"". Despite resisting calls for the introduction of GLT for many years, FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke stated that there was ""no reason to be against this technology"" on the eve of the match. The first referee to have access to the system in a competitive game was Djamel Haimoudi but the Algerian had no need to call upon GoalRef's magnetic field system in Yokohama. This is the first of two goal-line systems being trialed at the competition for the continental club champions, in which the title-holders of the host nation (J-League winners Sanfrecce Hiroshima on this occasion) also participate. Hiroshima, who won the Japanese championship for the first time last month to earn their place in football history, will also take part as the second system is used, with camera-based Hawk-Eye being used for Sunday's tie with the seven-time African champions. ""This is a kind of revolution,"" Valcke told FIFA's website before the match. ""It is the first time that this kind of technology is coming into football. We must ensure that when the ball goes into the goal, the referee must get the information that the ball has gone in. ""The referee has the final decision. The technology won't change the speed, value or spirit of the game."" It changed little as Hiroshima saw off Auckland City, thanks to a stunning strike from Toshihiro Aoyama after 66 minutes, as the New Zealanders' impressive goalkeeper Tamati Williams was finally beaten. However, it has added a further element to the referee's pre-match ritual with officials now needing to test the system 90 minutes before every match to determine whether the technology is working as expected. After FIFA had seemingly abandoned GLT in 2008 after freezing experiments into the practice, and preferring instead to look at using additional referees, the issue was reborn at the 2010 World Cup. After a Frank Lampard shot crossed the line but was not given as England lost to Germany in the Round of 16, FIFA chief Sepp Blatter backtracked on his previous belief that there was no room for goal-line technology in football. After a long testing process, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) voted in July to use GLT at the ongoing Club World Cup, as well as the 2013 Confederations Cup and 2014 World Cup in Brazil. ""This is also an important day for us,"" Valcke had said on Wednesday. ""Because we will use one of the two systems we are using here in the Fifa Confederations Cup next year."" Both Britain-based Hawk-Eye and Germany's GoalRef transmit their findings to devices that can be worn on officials' wrists.","FIFA uses goal-line technology at Club World Cup opener in Japan .

"(CNN) -- Not for the first time Mario Balotelli, who plays for one of Europe's biggest soccer teams AC Milan, is in the spotlight again. The Italian international is the focus of racially charged remarks made by Milan vice president Paulo Berlusconi, the younger brother of former prime minister and team owner Silvio Berlusconi. During a political rally for his brother where he invited the public to an upcoming match, the younger Berlusconi was caught on camera -- the video is now featured on the website of Italian newspaper La Repubblica -- saying: ""OK, we are all off to see the family's little black boy. ""He's a crazy head. All the young ladies are invited as well -- you can even have a chance to meet the president [Silvio Berlusconi]."" Milan declined to comment on the remarks when contacted by CNN, while Balotelli's representatives have yet to respond to phone and email messages. Italy national team striker Balotelli joined Milan last week after a two-and-a-half-year stint with English champions Manchester City, during which time he attracted media attention for his off-field antics and ill discipline on the pitch. The incident involving Berlusconi's brother comes one month after another racial incident involving a black AC Milan player. AC's German-born Ghanaian international midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the pitch after being subjected to racist chanting during a friendly match with fourth division team Pro Patria. Silvio Berlusconi, as well as world football head Sepp Blatter, backed Boateng for taking a strong stance against prejudicial abuse, though the FIFA president noted that walk-offs are not a long-term solution to the problem. Offensive . Italian football expert and author John Foot explained how Paulo Berlusconi's words were offensive on several levels. ""It is an insult,"" Foot told CNN. ""It's not n***** translated, but it would translate as 'little negro' or 'little family negro'. A lot of Italians wouldn't necessarily see it as racist, but that doesn't mean it isn't. ""I'm sure Balotelli would see it as an insult. Even if you take the racial element out of it, it is quite insulting. The idea that they own this person has a lot of other connotations."" Balotelli played for AC's city rivals Inter Milan between 2006 and 2010, during which time he was subjected to racist abuse by Juventus fans during a match in 2009. Foot thinks how Balotelli responds should such an incident occur again in the future could shape how Italian football tackles racism. ""When the first racist chants appear in a game he is playing in, are the players going to walk off?"" Foot asked. ""That is going to be a key moment. I think it will happen. ""It has entered into the football stadiums in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Some things have been done, but generally there is not a zero tolerance approach towards it. ""It's not just individuals. In Italy it could be a large part of the hardcore fans doing it, therefore it is a lot harder to deal with. ""I think the Boateng incident was really positive because it put the issue on the agenda and said, 'We're not going to take this anymore' and he was backed by the authorities which was really good. ""Let's see if they put their money where their mouth is and walk off during a Serie A game which is on television. If they do, I think it will have an impact."" When the deal -- worth around $31 million -- to bring Balotelli to AC was announced last week, La Stampa estimated the signing of ""Super Mario"" could be worth 400,000 votes in Silvio Berlusconi's bid for re-election in Italy later this month. While the incident could damage Berlusconi's image abroad, Foot doubted it would affect his popularity in Italy. ""His reputation abroad is pretty appalling anyway,"" added Foot. ""There hasn't been a debate in Italy about racist language. For a long time they used to use words to describe immigrants which were absolutely racist. ""It is something I don't think will have an impact on Berlusconi domestically."" The word ""negro"" was the subject of a racism storm in England in 2011, when Patrice Evra of Manchester United claimed he had repeatedly been called the word by Liverpool's Luis Suarez. The accusations sparked a debate over cultural differences over the word's meaning. Watch: Israeli football club faces fan backlash . Some claimed it was a term of endearment used in Uruguay, however Suarez was handed an eight-match ban and a Â£40,000 ($63,000) fine by England's football association.

Meanwhile, speaking from the Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa, where Ghana play Burkina Faso in Wednesday's semifinal, Kwadwo Asamoah, who plays for Milan's Serie A rivals Juventus, called for an end to racist abuse in football. ""Football is about coming together,"" the 24-year-old Ghana international told CNN. ""When it comes to something like this it makes you feel like you're not a human being. ""What I would say is please stop this racism because we are all one, we are all human beings. Football is about fun and bringing people together.""","Mario Balotelli focus of racially charged remarks.

"(CNN) -- Pele, Diego Maradona and Franz Beckenbaeur will forever be remembered in football fans' consciousness for helping Brazil, Argentina and West Germany win the World Cup. That trio symbolized the idea that international football -- pitting the game's very best players against one another -- was the pinnacle of a footballer's career. But that passion for international football has cooled, especially for young English players, according to World Cup winner Patrick Vieira. ""I don't feel like in England, the young players are dreaming of playing for the national team anymore,"" said Vieira, who is now Manchester City's Football Development Executive. ""I think it's maybe the lack of England's Football Association power, I would say,"" added Vieira, who won the World Cup with France in 1998 as well as Euro 2000. ""Maybe this is as well a lack of love for the national team. ""In England, I really don't understand how come so many young players from the age of 16-21 pull out of the national team for injury. ""When I grew up in France, I wanted to play for the French national team. That was my target, my dream."" Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has long argued that the European Champions League is the best competition in the world, surpassing even the World Cup, but Vieira insisted: ""The national team is bigger than anything and I was really proud to play for France."" The former French international argued a key part of his development as a player was linked to the time he spent with the French national team, in particular learning from the example of more experienced players such as Marcel Desailly and Didier Deschamps, the current les bleus coach. Vieira questioned whether the lack of elder statesmen within the current French international set-up had contributed to the disciplinary problems that surfaced at the World Cup in 2010 and more recently at Euro 2012. Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri has not been recalled for France's upcoming friendly against Japan and World Cup qualifier against Spain even after serving a three-match ban imposed by the French Football Federation. Nasri swore at a reporter following France's Euro 2012 quarter-final defeat by Spain after previously telling another journalist to ""Shut your mouth!"" in their opening match against England when he had scored. ""His non-selection is a surprise,"" said Vieira, who was speaking at the Leaders in Football Conference in London on Wednesday. ""I'm sure he will go back to the national team."" England expects . Vieira's view that young English players were somewhat ambivalent about playing for their country might give the FA pause for thought. On Tuesday the Football Association opened its elite football facility -- the $168-million St. George's Park complex -- which it hopes can help pave the way for the national team to win a major international tournament for the first time since 1966. However, Vieira urged patience for the positive effects of the St George's Park initiative to trickle down. ""It doesn't guarantee success and it might take 10 to 15 years,"" said the former Arsenal, Inter Milan and Manchester City midfielder. ""The heart of the English player is double or triple that of the Spanish or French player. That is a good base to start with."" City have their own ambitious plans for a new training academy, which Vieira described as ""unbelievable"". The project, which will boast 15 full-size and two half-size football pitches as well as accommodation for 40 youth-team players, will contain a 7,000-capacity stadium for youth team matches, a separate building for the first team and a bridge linking the Etihad Stadium to the area -- which will be known as the Etihad Campus. ""We want to bring our young players from the academy through to the first team,"" said Vieira. ""It's important as the fans really identify with these players and this is the philosophy of the club. ""But clubs like City, Manchester United and Chelsea will also always try and sign the exceptional player,"" added Vieira, when asked if the English Premier League champions were no longer interested in signing players such as Atletico Madrid striker Falcao, who is expected to leave the Spanish club next summer. In deciding how their academy should be run, City traveled round the world to look at examples of other successful academies as well as how other sports develop young talented players. City particularly liked the way aspiring NBA players spent much of their day within an academy environment, which helps them ""to learn how to behave as an individual"", said Vieira. Vieira is an ambassador for Western Union's new PASS initiative, turning every pass in this season's UEFA Europa League into funding for one day's education for young people around the world.","England's young players no longer ""dream"" of playing for their national team, says France World Cup winner Patrick Viera .

"(CNN) -- Leading international soccer player Kevin-Prince Boateng, who plays for one of Europe's top clubs, insists he will walk off in a competitive game if he is subjected to further racist abuse. European football's reputation has been tarnished by the scourge of racism this season but on Thursday matters came to head when AC Milan star Boateng kicked the ball into the stand and walked off after a group of fans had directed monkey chants at the Ghanian international and three of his teammates during a friendly match in northern Italy. ""I don't care what game it is -- a friendly, Italian league or Champions League match -- I would walk off again,"" the German-born Boateng told CNN in an exclusive interview on Friday. The 25-year-old ripped off his shirt in disgust during the first half of Thursday's friendly against lower league Italian side Pro Patria, before being joined by his teammates and opposition players in walking off the pitch. ""I'm sad and angry that I'm the one that has to take action,"" added the AC Milan midfielder, who has also played in the German and English Premier Leagues during his career. ""All the people who support me would support me in a big game. Players like Rio Ferdinand and Patrick Vieira have supported me and I just want to say thank you."" Milan, who have won the Italian title 18 times and the European Cup (now known as the Champions League) seven times, were using the friendly to prepare their side for the resumption of the league -- Serie A -- season after a brief winter break. During the friendly match, the AC Milan midfielder had told the referee three times he was being abused. ""If it happens again I'm not going to play anymore,"" said Boateng, who was born in Berlin. ""The referee said: 'Don't worry' but I said I do worry, it's not very nice. ""I was angry and I was sad, but it all came together and I said I don't want to play anymore. There were so many negative emotions that came up with me. ""I'm surprised we're still hearing these things in 2013. It's not the first time in my life that I've heard these things, but I'm 25 now and I've had enough this bulls***."" Several of Boateng's teammates -- M'Baye Niang, Urby Emanuelson and Sulley Muntari -- were also targeted by the monkey chanting fans. ""I think we should not say all the time that we didn't hear it, or go home and say I didn't hear nothing,"" said Boateng, explaining why he decided to walk off. ""We have to stop, look, and open our eyes. It was 100% racist and had nothing to do with football; it had nothing to do with our team playing against them like a rivalry and that is why I acted like that."" Italian prosecutors will press charges of inciting racial hatred against at least one person over the abuse that was directed at the Milan players. Police and stadium cameras have identified a 20-year-old man and prosecutors expect more people will face charges, prosecutor Mirko Monti told CNN. And Boateng called on football's regulators to take a stronger stance in combating racism. ""There are so many people, FIFA or whatever, that can do something against this. They should wake up and do it. ""If there is a racism those people should be banned from the stadium forever. They should not even enter the stadium anymore. Never again. That's the first thing they can do. ""We have to open our eyes, open our ears, listen to everything, see everything, and react on that."" Earlier Milan club president Silvio Berlusconi and former Italian Prime Minister had warned that the Serie A team will leave the pitch if they are faced with further anti-social behavior. Berlusconi has already called Boateng to congratulate him on his stance in the Pro Patria friendly. The Italian Football Association is also to investigate the incident. ""No sanction or measure can erase the disdain for an unspeakable and intolerable episode,"" said president of the Italian FA Giancarlo Abete in a statement. ""We must react with force and without silence to isolate the few criminals that transformed a friendly match into an uproar that offends all of Italian football."" This season matches across Europe have been punctuated by repeated outbursts of racism. Ahead of the European Championship finals in Poland and Ukraine last summer, UEFA president Michel Platini had urged players to allow the referee to deal with the problem of racist abuse, and stressed that officials could stop games if necessary. Boateng spent a sleepless night after his walkout, but promised to carry on his campaign to highlight the abuse he could experience in the future. ""I love the game so much that I would never quit football because of some stupid people."" After playing at youth level for Germany, Boateng decided to represent Ghana. During the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Boateng featured for Ghana in group game against Germany, with his brother Jerome playing for the European side in their 1-0 win.","AC Milan midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng promises to walk off the field of play if he is subjected to racist abuse.

"(CNN) -- World football's governing body is threatening to take a more hard-line approach to racist abuse after FIFA president Sepp Blatter called for clubs to be punished with points deductions and relegation if they are found guilty. Since AC Milan forward Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the pitch in a friendly match earlier this month, both FIFA and Europe's governing body have faced criticism over their perceived leniency towards players being racially abused. ""It is not enough to give a fine,"" Blatter told FIFA.com. ""Playing a game without spectators is one of the possible sanctions, but the best would be the deduction of points and the relegation of a team, because finally the club is responsible for their spectators."" Blatter's stance is something of a volte-face given two years ago he said racism did not exist in football and that any problems could be solved with a handshake. But the 76-year-old, who has spent the past 15 years in charge of FIFA, has changed his view following a number of recent unsavory incidents. Italy presses charges after AC Milan soccer racism . ""It is a phenomena where football is a victim of our society,"" added Blatter. ""Discrimination and racism is everywhere in our society. We in football cannot be made responsible for what happens in our society. ""But nowhere in the world -- regarding all the problems you can have in your private life, in business, in politics -- can you solve a problem by running away. ""I agree with and support the movement of Boateng -- as I have said -- as it was a strong warning. It is now up to us to take the adequate steps. ""What I feel we should do is give instructions to our national associations and the confederations -- specifically to the disciplinary committees -- to be very strong."" The ugly face of racism has reared its head far too often over the past 18 months with several high-profile incidents catching the headlines. Suarez fined, suspended over racist remarks . In December 2011, Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was hit with an eight-match suspension and $63,000 fine after being found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra. Last September, Chelsea captain John Terry was given a four-game ban and fined $347,000 for racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. Then in October 2012, England's Under-21 players were subjected to racist chanting during the European Championship qualifier in Krusevac. The punishment of a $105,000 fine and the order to play one under-21 match behind closed doors handed out by UEFA's disciplinary commission was then appealed by the organization as it was seen to be too lenient. UEFA appeals Serbia sanctions . However in an interview with French radio station RTL, UEFA president Michel Platini insisted the European governing body was in great shape to tackle racism. ""We have put rules in place with the referees in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League,"" said the Frenchman. Earlier this month FIFA imposed a one-match spectator ban on Bulgaria for racist abuse by their fans of a Denmark player. It was the first time the body had imposed anything more than a fine for racism . Boateng makes racism walkout vow . Prince-Boateng walked off the field of play after being subjected to racist chanting by supporters during a friendly game at fourth-tier club Pro Patria. Speaking to CNN in an exclusive interview following the incident, the Milan midfielder insisted he would walk off the field again if he was subjected to more racist chanting. """"If it happens again I'm not going to play anymore,"" he said. ""The referee said: 'Don't worry' but I said I do worry, it's not very nice. ""I was angry and I was sad, but it all came together and I said I don't want to play anymore. There were so many negative emotions that came up with me. ""I'm surprised we're still hearing these things in 2013. It's not the first time in my life that I've heard these things, but I'm 25 now and I've had enough this bulls***."" Boateng's decision to walk off the field was applauded by Platini, who told RTL: ""I appreciated this very much. I also sent a message of congratulations to AC Milan's [vice-president] Mr Galliani. I found [the decision] a good thing to do.""","FIFA threatens more hard-line approach to racism .

"(CNN) -- Italian club Lazio has been charged over the ""alleged racist behavior"" of its fans during November's Europa League clash with Tottenham. Supporters of the Rome side mocked the English team's links with the Jewish community by chanting ""Juden Tottenham, Juden Tottenham"" (""Tottenham Jews"" in German) in the 0-0 draw in the Italian capital. Tottenham has a large contingent of Jewish supporters, while Lazio has long had fans with right wing sympathies. ""Proceedings will also be instigated against S.S. Lazio for throwing of missiles and/or fireworks by their supporters, incidents of a non-sporting nature, late team arrival at the stadium, and late handling of the team sheet,"" European football's governing body UEFA said on Monday. It added that Tottenham also faces charges related to crowd disturbances at the Group J game, which took place 24 hours after a knife attack on its fans in Rome. It is not the first time this season that Lazio supporters have been accused of racism, with the club fined â‚¬40,000 (US$52,000) for abuse directed at Tottenham's black players during the clubs' previous meeting in London in September. The charges, which will be heard on January 24, continue a bad week for the standing of football in Italy, with the country's reputation having also been ""damaged"" in the eyes of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi after last week's racism walkoff involving AC Milan. Former Ghana international Kevin-Prince Boateng made global headlines when he reacted to abusive chanting from a section of Pro Patria fans in a friendly against the fourth tier side by walking off the pitch -- and the entire Milan side followed him. His actions earned widespread praise, including from Milan owner Berlusconi himself, but FIFA president Sepp Blatter is not among those who believe that Boateng's behavior was a step in the right direction. ""Walk off? That's not the solution,"" Blatter was reported to have said in Abu Dhabi-based newspaper The National. ""I don't think you can run away, because eventually you can run away if you lose a match. This is a very touchy subject, but there is zero tolerance of racism in the stadium."" Despite his credibility on the topic having been damaged in the eyes of many pundits after he told CNN in 2011 that racism could be settled by a handshake, Blatter is now advocating tougher punishments to deal with the issue. ""The only solution is to be very harsh with the sanctions -- and the sanctions must be a deduction of points or something similar,"" he said on Sunday. This is the first time that Blatter has publicly suggested a points deduction for clubs whose fans are racially abusive -- a stance which is backed by many figures within the game, including former Arsenal stars Patrick Vieira and Sol Campbell. Two days after Boateng walked off against Pro Patria, racism reared its ugly head again in Italy as some sections of Lazio's crowd were heard making monkey noises at Cagliari's black Colombian striker Victor Ibarbo. Although many of the crowd inside the Stadio Olimpico for the Serie A league clash jeered and whistled to drown out the racists, the referee was forced to halt play as he spoke to both team captains and ordered a message to be relayed over the PA system to warn fans that continued chanting would result in the game's suspension. Late last week, former Milan midfielder Clarence Seedorf warned that walking off pitches in protest at abusive chanting threatened to ""empower"" the racist minority. Should Lazio be found guilty of the charges, pressure will fall on UEFA to take tough sanctions after the body was widely criticized for issuing what was seen as a paltry $105,000 fine to the Serbian FA after an Under-21 match where opposing England players said they were racially abused. The punishment fell short of the $125,800 fine UEFA handed to Denmark international Nicklas Bendtner for exposing boxer shorts adorned with the logo of an online betting company during the 2012 European Championships.","Lazio charged by UEFA over ""alleged racist behavior"" of fans during Europa League clash .

"Santa Maria, Brazil (CNN) -- Pamella Vedovotto flips through a newspaper looking for the name of a man she calls her guardian angel. Rafael De Oliveira carried her to safety when a fire ripped through a nightclub in this southern Brazilian city early Sunday morning. ""I don't have words to thank him,"" Vedovotto told CNN during an interview at her small home on the outskirts of town. ""If it weren't for him, I would be in with all of those people who died. He gave me a new life."" De Oliveira, a university student, is in the newspaper's list of dead. Be ready for emergency at a crowded public gathering . Early Sunday, the Kiss nightclub was packed with about 2,000 revelers, well above official capacity. Vedovotto, a 19-year-old high school student, was at the club for a friend's birthday party. A fire broke out during a pyrotechnic display just after 2 a.m. Panicked clubgoers ran for the exit as the air filled with smoke. Harrowing stories emerge from nightclub's ashes . Vedovotto tried to run, but she was pushed against a metal barrier, unable to breathe. ""A girl fell under the barrier and everyone was pushing,"" she said. ""Her neck was snapped backwards and she fell dead on the floor,"" the student said, breaking into sobs. ""Everyone was shouting help, God get me out of here. It was hell, get me out of here."" A man, who she later would discover was De Oliveira, grabbed her and carried her toward the door. She says he pulled her yellow dress up over her face so she wouldn't breathe in the smoke. ""There were all these people on the floor, shouting for help, and we stepped on them, all these girls in high heels."" Vedovotto said things got worse when they got close to the exit. Security guards didn't realize there was a fire and closed the doors, probably thinking revelers were trying to get out without paying their bills, she said. ""Then they opened the doors again. But when they opened them there were already a bunch of people on the floor, screaming."" Brazil nightclub fire: 'Like a war zone' with bodies piled . More than 230 people were killed that night. Most died from smoke inhalation and many were trampled. Rescue workers had to tear down walls to reach survivors and get to the bodies. Police have since arrested two club owners and two members of the band whose pyrotechnic show, police believe, may have started the fire. Vedovotto said she has no sympathy for them. ""Everyone is dead; everyone is dead because of them,"" she said. ""They should rot in jail. They didn't lose anyone."" But it's the thought of De Oliveira that troubles her the most. Monday, Vedovotto went to the makeshift morgue where bodies were laid. She found his coffin and met his parents. ""I asked for their forgiveness for not keeping him from going back in,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Be warned Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray -- from here on in it's all about grand slam titles for Roger Federer. The 31-year-old Federer has done it all in the world of tennis, winning more championships than any other male player in history and spending a record number of weeks at the top of the world rankings. But as he approaches the twilight of his glittering career, the 17-time major winner is prioritizing adding to that record haul over returning to the No. 1 spot. After clinching a record-equaling seventh Wimbledon singles title last year, the Swiss maestro occupied the top berth for a 287th week, breaking the previous record held by U.S. icon Pete Sampras. While admitting reaching No. 1 for the first time in 2004 was a special achievement, when asked by CNN's Leone Lakhani whether he would rather win grand titles or returning to the top, the current No. 2 replied: ""At this stage in my career grand slam titles. ""Last year, to get back to world No. 1 was incredible, but I think it is really the first time you get there. You cannot match that up with any other moment, maybe in your career, because it's such a big thing. ""At this point in my career its titles. I've won a lot and I feel if I keep playing the way I am I can still achieve a bit more. So I guess its titles now."" Records . Since turning professional 15 years ago, Federer has notched up a steady stream of records, but surpassing landmarks has never been something he has paid much attention to. ""I never had a 'to do' list,"" continued the 31-year-old Swiss player. ""It's really the media who talk about it. ""When I was close to the all-time grand slam record or the all-time weeks at world No. 1, I was one week away, one slam away, of course you're going to push to try and beat that, but I never adjusted my schedule accordingly. ""I knew if I played well, records would fall along the way."" Motivation . Despite his unparalleled success, in recent years Federer has seen his position as the reigning power in tennis taken by the all-conquering Djokovic. The Serb has won five of his six grand slam titles in the last two years, while world No. 3 Andy Murray has also risen to the top by winning his first major title as well as reaching the last three showpiece finals. It was Britain's Murray who eliminated Federer at the semifinal stage of last month's Australian Open, an event Djokovic won. ""I still have the hunger and the urge to achieve more, because I truly love this sport,"" added Federer. ""That's the easiest part for me, the motivational part. ""I get a lot of questions asking how I do it, but for me it's pretty simple. I wake up in the morning excited to be a tennis player."" Balance . Despite his sporting ambition, Federer is very conscious of the importance of spending time with his wife and twin daughters. ""I'm working hard I'm training hard, but at the same time I'm making sure I have enough rest and family time,"" said the Swiss star. ""At my stage of my career, I need to make sure I get the balance right.""","Roger Federer would rather win more grand slams than return to No. 1 ranking .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova has candy, the Williams sisters have fashion interests and Bjorn Borg has underwear. Now, world No. 3 Andy Murray has joined the ranks of tennis superstars looking beyond the court to expand their multi-million dollar fortunes. The 2012 U.S. Open champion may have racked up over $26 million in prize money during a glittering tennis career, but the Scot is hoping to swell his coffers further after acquiring the Cromlix House Hotel near his hometown of Dunblane in Scotland. Murray, a winner of 25 career ATP World Tour titles, plans to turn the Victorian-era mansion into a 15-room five-star hotel set to open in 2014. That opening date will allow the hotel to potentially welcome golf fans attending the Ryder Cup at the nearby Gleneagles course next year. The project will also provide a boost to the local economy, creating 40 new jobs and providing revenue for other businesses in the area. ""I am pleased to have acquired Cromlix House and look forward to securing its future as a successful business,"" the 25-year-old Murray said in a statement. ""By re-establishing Cromlix as a leading luxury hotel at the heart of the Dunblane community we will be able to attract new visitors to the area, create a number of new jobs and focus on supporting other local businesses. ""I'm pleased to be able to give something back to the community I grew up in."" Cromlix House is set in 50 acres of woodland and has its very own trout loch. The hotel has special meaning to the Murray family, with Andy's older brother Jamie, also a professional tennis player, marrying his Colombian wife Alejandra Gutierrez there in 2010. The day-to-day running of the hotel will be handled by Inverlochy Castle Management International (ICMI), who look after eight other properties in Scotland. ""We are delighted to be working with Andy in this very exciting project to redevelop and run Cromlix House,"" said ICMI's managing director Norbert Lieder. ""Our team of experts has experience in every aspect of the hospitality industry and specialise in working with independent properties and transforming them into luxurious destinations. ""I am confident that, with Andy, we can create a very special hotel in his home community. ""While we aim to create a destination that attracts visitors from around the world we are also determined to ensure it remains a venue of choice for local people.""","Andy Murray to open five-star hotel near his Scottish hometown of Dunblane .

"(CNN) -- I can remember my first Fourth of July after returning home from Iraq, when I was working as a bartender in a hotel in Ouray, Colorado. I stepped out from behind the bar for a minute and watched from the balcony above the front entrance to the hotel as the fireworks exploded in the sky above the town. I could feel them as much as I could hear them, just like in the war. And for a moment, I stood a bit straighter and was proud for having served my country. But then the cheers and the hollers from the crowds along the street below quickly faded from my ears until all I could hear were the explosions. And my mind and body suddenly became set and tense and ready for anything. Then the silent series of snapshots layered upon one another: dead dogs on the side of the road with tongues hanging out of their mouths, a dead child with black eyes, Marines dying in helicopter crashes, Marines dying in gunbattles, Marines being killed accidentally by other Marines, destroying people's homes with artillery, killing other human beings violently, being terrified, being glad that you were killing other human beings violently, being exhausted, looking into the devastated eyes of the people whose homes you had just destroyed with artillery, sweating in the 110 degree heat for too long, being hunted, babies crying, things exploding, wishing you were anywhere else on the planet than where you were, bullets snapping by you, being horrified about making a mistake, thinking that at any moment you will be dead, thinking that you would not want to be anywhere else on the planet because this was your war and you were glad you didn't miss it, land mines, snipers, and the terror in your buddy's voice over the radio as he lies trapped underneath his vehicle begging for someone to get him some air support because they were taking fire from all directions and were sure that they were all about to die. Watching from the balcony, I knew then, for certain, that the war had forever changed me. I might as well have been a million miles away from the people who were standing just a few feet from me, people who had not seen what I'd seen or done what I'd done. This was to be the first of many times, whether they be Independence Days, Memorial Days, or just random occasions where, out of the blue, the visions of the war would come rushing back. Along with the visions come the isolation, the anger, the sadness or the post-war confusion -- strong, heavy feelings that could easily, if you let them, pull you over the side of the cliff. Those of us who have experienced war firsthand know that it is the most terrible of all things. We know that there are many different ways for people to die, most of which have shorn away all dignity. We know that war consumes everything in its path -- the young, right along with the old. And, unfortunately, the innocent, right along with the guilty. We know that war's aftermath can be obvious: We can see that lives have been torn down with the buildings that are now nothing more than rubble. But some of us have also discovered that the aftermath can be seemingly intangible; a molecular shift in brain chemistry and the neural pathways caused by seeing, smelling, hearing, killing and fearing just a little too much. As the young men and women who make up military units, we know that we will usually share war's experiences. I know that when my toes are cold in the high Afghan desert, so are everyone else's. When I am hungry because the supply convoys have been attacked by the enemy, so is everyone else. And when I am scared, and the possibility of death becomes very real as the bullets and shrapnel rip through the air around us, I know that everyone else is scared, too. But for some reason, when I first came home and felt confused, isolated, angry and sad, I forgot that there was a good chance that there were others out there, just like me, who felt exactly the same way. Now I realize that this mistake almost cost me my life. When I first came home, there were months of isolation where I was too proud and too ashamed to talk about my feelings -- a downward spiral that almost ended in suicide. But, I was lucky, because through a twist of creative fate, and a simple film project that quickly became a full-blown documentary based on personal footage I'd shot in the war, I was forced to share my experiences with others. I spent weeks of 12-hour days with the editors going over the scenes of horror that I'd experienced. These editors quickly became people whom I loved and trusted dearly. Opening up, and talking candidly about the things that were locked away behind my emotional barriers, ultimately led to my recovery. In essence, the making of a film became one long therapy session. So, if any of you reading this are struggling with post-combat emotions, please consider these three simple things -- things that took me a long time to understand: You are not alone, it's OK if you are not OK and it really does help talk to someone about it. There is no shame in not being Superman. Call your buddies from the war. Call the Wounded Warrior Project. Call the Veterans Affairs' hot line. Do whatever you need to do to talk about what you are feeling. As warriors, we are taught that in battle weakness and vulnerability are the same. But no one tells us that once we are back home, things change, and vulnerability becomes strength. Becoming vulnerable, and understanding that we need to talk about what happened, is the first step in opening the emotional pressure valve that is inside all of us. As veterans, we need each other now just as much as we did when we were fighting the war (as so many of our brothers and sisters are still doing at this very moment). Just as we did in battle, we always take care of our own. So if you are struggling, please remember that the sun is still there, but it has just gone behind the clouds for a while. To make it shine again, we must take care of each other, hold on to each other and help each other through the pain. This Fourth of July, I will be flying back to the United States, from England, after a three-week research trip for a novel I am about to begin writing. I smile widely when I compare life now to where I was nine years ago. I smile because I've chosen to make my war experiences a source of strength versus letting them make me weak. The darkness has largely subsided, and I now know that war can give you a valuable sense of perspective. Because when you have been that close to death, especially at a young age, the rest of your days become infinitely valuable and take on new meaning. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Scotti.","Veteran Mike Scotti recalls how memories of war rushed back during July Fourth fireworks .

"(CNN) -- In this acrimonious and bitter American summer of 2010, a summer during which at times it has seemed that everyone is angry at everyone else, I sat outside the other afternoon and read a magazine. The magazine was Life. The cover date on the issue was July 4, 1955. The middle of the 1950s was the apex of the era in which Life -- the weekly Life -- was a mainstay in American homes. Arriving like clockwork in mailboxes in big cities and tiny towns, Life, with its 20-cent cover price and its red-and-white rectangular logo, represented America talking to itself. It didn't just mirror the national conversation; it was, in large measure, the national conversation. Fat and prosperous, seemingly as tall as the Empire State Building when compared to today's magazines, Life in the summer of '55 offered on its numerous advertising pages remedies for the sweltering days and nights the nation was going through: four separate display ads for different brands of lemonade, ads for window-mounted air conditioners and fans, colorful full-page ads for fancy ice cream (Lady Borden Plantation Peach, Meadow Gold Hawaiian Sherbet). But that was not the fascinating thing about this particular issue. That is not what, in this rancorous summer of 2010, has the power, over all the years, to make you stop and reflect. Near the front of the magazine, the lead story summed up the mood of the United States in the week that had just ended. The headline was: ""Nobody Is Mad With Nobody."" The magazine reported: . ""Summer, announced by graduation and the Fourth of July, rolled over a nation up to its ears in domestic tranquility."" And: . ""Embroiled in no war, impeded by no major strikes, blessed by almost full employment, the U.S. was delighted with itself and almost nobody was mad with nobody."" And: . ""This week millions of Americans were purring with contentment --  when they were not roaring with exuberance."" And: . ""The satisfaction showed in the grinning faces of Vermonters, hearing an easygoing speech by the President of the U.S. It was evident in the triumph of a Coloradoan standing amid chest-deep wheat where there had been only dust weeks before. The great nation, made possible by the bold planning of the Founding Fathers, had reached a peak the planners could scarcely have imagined."" How much of this may have been an illusion? What portion of Life's snapshot of the United States in that summer 55 years ago may have been a willful fantasy, a purposely comforting dream? Certainly a case can be made that, even in placid times, the cloudless rendering of unfettered happiness that Life was selling was in part a carefully marketed image of the country. Alan Brinkley, in his excellent recent biography of Life founder Henry Luce, used that very issue of Life among his examples of Luce's desire to build national consensus: of Luce's determination to convince Americans that they had a great shared purpose, and that they were doing just fine. History tells us that the United States of 1955 may not have been quite the unblemished, unremittingly joyful land described in that issue. You're probably already checking off the things about America that needed fixing back then: Racial inequity was widespread, constrictive conformity was all around, intolerance of anything different was itself tolerated ... your list could go on and on. But here is what should give us pause: . If monolithic national happiness was, in fact, being sold as a commodity back then, a case can also be made that the commodity being sold to us today is national animosity. Just about every day, we are told how furious we are at each other. If Luce's Life magazine was endeavoring to promote the notion of consensus, what we are being relentlessly barraged with now is a message of anti-consensus. And that may be just as false an impression, in its own way, as the everyone's-joyful pitch was in 1955. It's a possibility that is at least worth thinking about. The television airwaves these days are bristling with images of rage, yes. But is that rage truly a representation of how most Americans feel about each other? Combativeness has always been an easy sell; that early hit television show was known as the ""Friday Night Fights,"" not the ""Friday Night Handshakes."" In 2010 the three cable TV networks that specialize in news coverage are the place where America's disagreements are on perpetual display, where the conversations tend to be the most vigorous, and sometimes the most high-decibel. They often depict a nation ready to duke it out. Yet on a given evening, the combined peak total of people watching the three news networks on cable at a given moment seldom exceeds 5 million. Out of a U.S. population of 310 million. Is there anything to be made of that -- of the fact that more than 90 percent of the country may be tuning out the constant battles, may be symbolically choosing to hit the ""mute"" button? And even putting that aside, is there a chance that in this allegedly angry summer, a significant portion of the country may elect not to wake up all that angry with their fellow citizens? That there may be an underreported reservoir of good will, and willingness to listen to the other guy, out there? That the country yearns for lowered voices and reasoned conversation? For a shared purpose, a steady middle ground? Just asking the question, for your end-of-summer consideration. ""Nobody Is Mad With Nobody,"" Life declared, 55 summers ago. It may have merely been a pipe dream. But in the words of a great Southern California philosopher: . Wouldn't it be nice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","In summer of 1955, Life magazine featured a story titled: ""Nobody is mad with nobody""

"London (CNN) -- Never underestimate the power of visualization. ""I was always dreaming about being the best in tennis,"" said world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, who became the first Open era player to win three consecutive Australian Open titles after beating Andy Murray 6-7 7-6 6-3 6-2 in Sunday's final. ""I remember as a kid, I was improvising and making little trophies out of different materials and going in front of the mirror, lifting the trophies and saying 'Nole was the champion!'"" The 25-year-old claimed an unprecedented third straight title in Melbourne and cemented his place among the game's all-time greats -- a feat all the more remarkable given the Serb's upbringing amid conflict in the Balkans during the 1990s. ""We didn't have a childhood that is similar to some of our generation of tennis players because we grew up during the war. There was a lot of struggle, difficulty financially ... but we survived,"" said Djokovic, referring to the three-year war which was the bloodiest in Europe since World War II. ""It was really hard to succeed and I have to thank God for the big support from my father and my mother and all the family,"" added Djokovic, who spoke to CNN's Open Court show during the Mubadala World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi, prior to the start of the season's first grand slam in Australia. ""They believed in me and gave me hope when I was facing a lot of disbelief, a lot of doubts. Backed and also blessed with some impressive sporting genes -- father Srdjan and his uncle Goran were professional skiers -- Djokovic began his tennis odyssey at the age of four. ""I saw tennis on the TV and I saw the tennis court (near his parent's restaurant in Kapaonik, southern Serbia) and my father brought me a small tennis racket. That's when I think we all fell in love with the sport,"" he explained. It was here that Djokovic caught the eye his first coach Jelena Gencic. ""I knew that Nole would be the best in the world. ""Somebody asked him: 'Hey, boy! What do you want to be when you grow up?' (And he would reply): 'Be the first in pro-tennis.' He was six years old."" That almost in-bred ambition and winning mentality has brought him win four grand slam titles over the past two seasons -- notably claiming his first Wimbledon title in 2011 and his third Australian Open crown in the marathon six-hour final in Melbourne 12 months ago. ""Pressure is a privilege in a way and a big challenge for every professional athlete,"" said Djokovic. ""It's just a matter of understanding it, and maturing as a player and getting that necessary experience to use it at the right moments to cope,"" he says. ""It's a privilege because it means that you are doing something that counts. And all my life I have been dreaming to be the best in what I do and my dreams came true."" Last year, from a psychological standpoint, Djokovic had a lot to cope with. Along with epic victories on court came a great loss off it with the death of his grandfather, Vladimir last April. Further emotional strain followed in October when his father was hospitalized for a serious respiratory infection. But there were also more welcome distractions on tour. Aside from his celebrity status -- which he enjoys -- and a legion of fans who give him ""a lot of energy, positive vibrations and love,"" Djokovic plays mentor to his two brothers, 21-year-old Marko and Djordje who turns 18 in July. A regular presence in the crowd at grand slams, Djokovic's brothers are now making their way in the game. ""They have great ambitions and I'm happy and fortunate to be able to advise them on and off court with their game and with their psychology in some way if I can,"" said Djokovic, who is all too aware of the weight of expectation on his siblings' shoulders given their big brother is world No. 1. ""Everybody expects them to play well and to do even better ... but each one has an individual path that they have to respect and I'm trying to help."" As Djokovic concedes, having three brothers away from home, is hard for their mother Dijana. ""It's definitely heartbreaking for (her) to see all three sons go away and none of us live in Serbia ... but (my parents) understand this is the life we have chosen and they respect our decision,"" said the Australian Open finalist. While Djokovic continues to turn his childhood dreams into spectacular reality, it's clear no matter where he finds himself in the world, his values and heart remain as close to home as ever. ""I try to stay humble as much as I can because I want to have the most important, most valuable people in my life around me like family and friends. They are the ones who actually keep me grounded and focused on what I do.""","World No.1 talks to CNN's Open Court about life at the top and his upbringing in Serbia .

"(CNN) -- To my mind, gambling is the son of avarice and the father of despair. I have never got in over my head where gaming is concerned but I have witnessed some horror stories that have made the front page of the national press and, away from the blackjack table, I have experienced the sharp decline of the floor beneath my feet when I have invested more than I could afford to lose. In one walk of life, you are a victim of the times and, therefore, a blight on acceptable living. And a candidate for somebody like Harvard to throw shit loads of money into some groundbreaking research so that they can determine whether or not you have similar brain activity to that seen in cocaine addicts. Which would mean you can be categorized as suffering from ""impulse control disorder"" and which would ultimately mean that you can pay for and be treated acceptably. In another life, a merchant bank will throw serious money at you, start you off on utilities and call you ""a trader"". I tend only to bet on the things that are easy to get caught up in. That said, I never really get a buzz from betting, even if I win, which isn't often. Having grown up on Mike Tyson knocking the heads off anyone who was stupid enough to get in a ring with him, I found myself getting carried away with the pre-fight bravado just like everybody else -- to the point that I wagered £200 on ""Iron Mike"" to beat Lennox Lewis in 2002. Tyson wasn't the only man down and out when Lewis connected with a big right hand towards the end of the eighth round and, if the truth were told, William Hill (the English bookmaker), was never in any danger where my bet was concerned. And in that brief remembrance of fights past can be found my saving grace where would-be gambling addiction is concerned. When it comes to staking my life on the outcome of any given sporting event, I haven't got a f***ing clue what I'm doing. I recognize that fact and I am not ashamed to admit it. Whether confessing that important piece of information to either my colleagues urging me to join in a game of high-stakes poker or to my father in a best-of-three pool match down the pub, I can honestly say that I have saved both a fair amount of embarrassment and incalculable amounts of money by putting my cards on the table at the outset. Despite that, it is probably fair to say that I have been exposed to gambling and its downfalls slightly more often than the average person. When you are trapped on a coach or in a plane or in sunny climes with 20 millionaires, one of two things will happen: the conversation turns to women -- and, by extension, wives -- or, as if by magic, somebody produces a pack of cards. Either way, somebody always takes a pasting. From that moment on, anything can happen. And in my time as a footballer, I have seen it all -- from players losing tens of thousands of pounds on the turn of a card, and their families staging interventions, to their more fortunate contemporaries winning $250,000 in a Las Vegas casino after popping down to the lobby to buy a phonecard. ""Card schools"" are not as prolific among professional football ranks as you might think. In fact, I'd go so far to say that, with each crop of new players which comes through, another few card schools fall by the wayside. These days, it seems there are more important vices to spend one's money on, like prostitutes and fast cars. But I did play at one Premier League club which had developed a fairly serious card school. I judge the level of seriousness by the fact that, as the team bus pulled in to our London opposition's stadium, several of the team were missing from the pre-match walk on the pitch -- historically used to check what stud is needed for the turf but, instead, is now used as a chance to upload pictures of empty stadiums on to Twitter. Those players had remained on the bus, wrapping up their last hand and making sure that the bus driver didn't clear anything away. We went into that match very confident and I am convinced we would have won, save for two individuals who produced less than average performances. Back on the bus, the card school reassembled while I made the rest of the players' cups of coffee. Walking back and forth along the bus, delivering their caffeine fix for the long journey home, I began to notice that the two players who had played so badly were also the two players who had between them lost tens of thousands of pounds since we had set off from home the day before. The running total was being kept by another player and he flashed me a sheet of paper as I walked past, only because he wanted to show me he was significantly up. I resented having to give the coffees out, let alone my wages. The experience gave me an added incentive not to get involved; it was clear a player could not function on the pitch with such a heavy financial burden hanging over him. But it didn't stop there. With no money left to gamble one of the players threw an expensive piece of jewelery onto the table. The bet was several thousand, all in. The other players looked at him and, without the expertise of a certified gemologist, it was decided a second piece should also be thrown in. He lost the lot. Around six weeks later, the defeated player still hadn't paid his debt. Worse, his car was spotted every day outside a betting shop that was close to our training ground. One day, a member of the same card school came in looking a little shell shocked and proceeded to tell the players assembled for breakfast in the canteen what he had witnessed at the same betting shop after training the previous day. I'll let him tell the story because I can remember it almost word for word, it has become a bit of a cult tale in football circles (I have changed all the names, including any business names etc): . ""We finished training and thought we'd get a takeaway. ""'Nobby' said: ""Let's just stop in at the betting shop and see what's on'. So he put on an accumulator. He picks five horses and we go to get the food. We come back and three of the horses have won so we hang about. ""Then the next one wins and the other one wins. Nobby cleaned up, thousands and thousands! So I say: 'Nobby, class, mate. You can pay off the lads, get your stuff back and give that money to your missus'. She'd been badgering him about a new runaround, as I recall. But he says: 'Na, mate. I'm on a roll, ain't I?' ""So he puts a bit on the next one. Doesn't win. And the next one. Doesn't win again. I can't get him out of the place, so I drive to his house and tell his missus what's happening. She grabs the kids and makes me drive her back. By the time we get there, he doesn't have anything left, mate. Not a f***ing thing."" It's worth bringing this story up because a lot of people don't know when to stop. The trick is in never getting started. Yet that last sentence is easy for me to type from the comfort of my office and with the kids safely tucked up in bed. I have never experienced a gambling addiction ... but I know a man who has. On a pre-season tour, I once roomed with a guy who had a genuine gambling addiction. We had never spoken to each other in the whole time I had been at the club, simply because we were very different people, and that wasn't about to change off the back of one trip in the sun, despite the manager's best efforts. We were away for a week and, I promise you, the only thing we said to each other was: ""Have you got the room key?"" But there was another reason as to why we couldn't strike up a meaningful conversation. He had an extraordinary inability to detach himself from one of two laptop screens, which were open on two separate online bookmakers' sites, or -- if we were coming back from training -- his iPhone, on which he had the mobile app versions running continuously. One night, I woke up to go to the bathroom and saw him feverishly placing bets on college basketball. It must have been about 3am and quite what he knew about college basketball is anyone's guess. I have thought many times as to whether I should have said something but I have concluded anything I could had said would have fallen on deaf ears. Shortly after our return, his family stepped in and he began to go to meetings for his gambling problems. As far as I know, he has never relapsed. I have thought about him a lot in the intervening years because, for a long time, I didn't have much sympathy for those who frittered away their money at the ""bookies"". I couldn't understand how a person could continue on the path to ruin while their kids needed food, clothes and education. But one man's gambling is another man's harmless flutter and the level of the stakes are, of course, extremely circumstantial. Betting on a game is against the rules for professional footballers, even when they are betting on their own team to win. Anyway, a football team can't legislate for somebody being sent off or an opposing striker having the game of his life or a freak spate of injuries in the first 10 minutes -- unless they take action to account for such things and I have certainly never seen how that could be the case. That said, I do know players have manipulated the system to their advantage.","In his latest piece, The Secret Footballer tells CNN about gambling in the EPL .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps it is ironic that in London Fashion week, a man who crafted one of the most beautiful and enriching football tapestries should be left watching the seams of his work unravel. While the next set of trendsetters sit with their heads craned towards the catwalk across some of the capital's plushest venues, one of football's great designers was left shrouded under a cloak of misery on a cold February night in north London. As Arsene Wenger trudged off down the Emirates tunnel, his side soundly beaten 3-1 by Bayern Munich in the first leg of its last-16 Champions League clash Tuesday, perhaps the reality had at last set in. Outplayed and outclassed, the seemingly unstoppable chasm between Arsenal and Europe's elite shows no sign of stopping. When Wenger arrived as a virtual unknown at Arsenal in October 1996, few had the foresight to imagine just how this professorial figure would redefine the game in England. While his look may have suggested a more school teacher like approach, the reality was anything but. It was art. From knitting together one of the most wonderfully aesthetic sides to have graced the Premier League and embroidering it with gems such as Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and the other strands of brilliance, Wenger brought about a renaissance period in English football. To watch Wenger's Arsenal in its pomp was something joyful to behold, a privilege and a delight. And yet while it was easy on the eye, this team was made of such strong fabric, resilient, interwoven with the DNA of winners. Those were the days when Bergkamp would produce moments to take your breath away, pirouetting on a sixpence and scoring a goal which would leave you open mouthed. Thierry Henry would have you believe he was from a different planet with an outrageous flick, run and finish, while the gladiatorial Patrick Vieira would give Arsenal the heart it so sorely lacks today. The likes of Robert Pires, Freddie Ljungberg, Marc Overmars, Emmanuel Petit, Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole, players who would excite, produce when it mattered. They were winners. This makes it all the more galling for Arsenal fans, who have watched their club fall dramatically from the days where it produced some of the most scintillating football ever witnessed in the Premier League. During the 2003/4 season, Arsenal went through an entire season unbeaten, winning 26 and drawing 12 of their 38 league games, cruising to the title by 11 points. That team was labeled 'The Invincibles'. Those days seem a lifetime ago. Not since its FA Cup win in 2005 has Arsenal managed to win a trophy -- a fact which Wenger is reminded of almost daily whenever he lifts a newspaper or turns on the radio. The three Premier League titles and four FA Cup trophies are part of yesteryear as is the club's appearance in the 2006 Champions League final, where it was beaten by Barcelona. In a society which demands instant gratification, Wenger is losing the battle. Held up as a beacon of financial prudence and a club ideally positioned for the advent of the FFP rules, Arsenal is constantly applauded for the way it conducts itself. But while the bank accounts might be full, the trophy cabinet continues to gather dust as frustration grows over the lack of progress made on the pitch. The sale of star players such as Robin van Persie and Cesc Fabregas has only exacerbated the fact that Arsenal can no longer compete with the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea over an entire season. Being dumped out of the League Cup, the country's third most important domestic competition, by a Bradford side in the bottom rung of English football, was humiliating. Crashing out at home to first division Blackburn in the prestigious FA Cup was another embarrassing episode in a season which is unraveling at an alarming pace. But against Bayern, a team seemingly cruising to domestic title success, there was a chance for redemption. A lesser club than Bayern might have wilted under the disappointment of losing last year's Champions League final inside its own stadium in such heartbreaking fashion. The penalty shoot out defeat by Chelsea left its players crushed, devastated and bewildered after it had dominated for so much of the contest. Its reply, however, speaks volumes for the team. A 15 point lead at the top of the Bundesliga, a team with a record of 57 points from 22 games and a defense which had conceded in 450 minutes of football shows little sign of sulking. Add to that the staggering run of away form which had seen Jupp Heynckes team win 10 out of its past 11 away games and it was obvious to see why Arsenal was up against it. Fresh from Wenger's outburst at the press conference Tuesday and its shock FA Cup defeat by second-tier Blackburn last Saturday, Arsenal began confidently. At least it did for the first six minutes. Then it all went downhill. Germany international Tony Kroos was afforded time and space and duly took advantage, lashing home his fifth Champions League goal and giving Bayern the perfect start. That strike tore through the already fragile confidence of an Arsenal side which looked decisively anaemic. While Arsenal struggled, Bayern appeared to be cut from a different cloth. The Germans swarmed around the pitch, every pass tailor made as it unpicked the stitching in Arsenal's defense with ease. It took just 21 minutes to leave Arsenal's dream of qualification ripped to shreds as Bayern strengthened its grip on the contest. Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny could only parry Daniel van Buyten's near-post header and Thomas Muller was on hand to smash the ball into the roof of the net. The interval brought respite from the jeers which greeted the halftime whistle and gave a chance for Arsenal to regroup. And regroup it did. Suddenly it awoke from its nerve induced coma and began to show glimpses of what its fans so badly crave. That fleet of foot, that crisp passing with the wonderfully talented Jack Wilshere trying to thread those ""eye of the needle"" passes to finally find a way through the Bayern defense. In the end, it took some luck and an uncharacteristic piece of poor defending which allowed the home side back into the game. A corner was awarded when it shouldn't have been and Lukas Podolski ensured his side made the most of its good fortune, heading home against his former club to reduce the deficit. Now it was Arsenal which began to grow and only a wonderful reaction save from Manuel Neuer denied substitute Olivier Giroud an equalizer. It proved to be a crucial moment as with 13 minutes remaining, Mario Mandzukic bundled home Philipp Lahm's cross to all but end Arsenal's hope of making the quarterfinal. Bayern, which is unbeaten in 19 games since losing to Bayer Leverkusen on October 28 last year, will now expect to finish the job on March 13 in Munich. ""We expected a very big start from Arsenal here at home with the fans behind them,"" Bayern's Arjen Robben told ITV. ""I know from my time in England and we warned all of the players we have to be there from the first minute because there will be a storm going here at the Emirates Stadium. ""I think we did very well and of course if you score two goals you're in a great position."" Based on past results in the competition, Arsenal has just a 2.2% chance of progressing to the next stage -- but in Wilshere it has one player with great heart and determination. It is little surprise that Barcelona's players are already beginning to voice their admiration of the midfielder in a similar way they did during the pursuit of Cesc Fabregas. For now Wilshere remains at Arsenal and fully focused on the task in hand. ""In the second half, we stepped it up and it's unfortunate we didn't do that in the first half,"" Wilshere told ITV. ""I'm not sure why. Maybe it's a bit of nerves or anxiety, because we show what we can do when we play. We will look at it and try to put it right."" But while Wenger ponders a redesign, Bayern will surely only grow stronger. For next season they will have their own artist and in Pep Guardiola, the former Barceloan coach, it will have a man who has produced one of the great works of modern football. In the night's other game, Joao Moutinho's second half strike was enough to give Porto a 1-0 win over Malaga. In a tight and cagey contest, Moutinho popped up six minutes after the break to take Alex Sandro's pass in his stride and fire home past Willy Caballero. But Malaga coach Manuel Pellegrini is adamant his side can still prevail when the two teams meet again in three weeks time. ""Whether it is a good result or not we will see at the end of 180 minutes,"" Pellegrini told Spanish TV station TVE. ""To lose is never good, but losing by just the one goal is the best thing we can take from the game. ""For all the possession Porto had they didn't create many clear cut chances and even the goal itself is offside. ""You have to give credit to Porto for the way they pressed us all over the pitch, but we have to apply the same pressure in Malaga. ""We can still turn the tie around at La Rosaleda. We have demonstrated this year that we can compete with anyone.""","Bayern Munich claims a 3-1 win at Arsenal in last-16 of Champions League .

"(CNN) -- Manila often gets a bad rap, derided as dirty, chaotic, and an incoherent mess of unfinished urban areas and slums. Navigate the city's streets and discover the many faces of Manila. It's a world away from carefully planned Asian cities like Singapore -- which makes it perfectly suited for visitors who don't need their lives hermetically sealed in air-conditioned shininess. Manila is alive with a mix of cultures, from Spain, China and the numerous Philippines islands. Sights to gawp at are thin on the ground, but the city streets have enough going on to enthrall even the most disinterested visitor. Though it was bombed to bits during the Second World War, Intramuros is one of the most coherent areas of the city. Worth a morning's visit, the old walled city's buildings (or rather what was left of them) were left untouched, even when the area was given an update in the 1980s. But it still retains a unique atmosphere in a city where the capital's expanding population is reflected in its growing sprawl. The Manila Cathedral was one of the buildings pummeled in the war, but the rebuilt version is faithful to the original 16th-century edifice. Fort Santiago, once the guarding fortress of the city and the Pasig River, is now a war memorial. Nearby is Rizal Park, a green spot named after the national hero. What he would have made of the moat outside the old city's walls being made into a golf course is anybody's guess. Taxis are the best way to negotiate the city, and they're cheap and plentiful, but it's worth jumping into the back of a crazily colorful jeepney at least once, just for the experience. Regardless of the means, head towards the towers of Makati, one of the more central areas that make up Metro Manila. Home to big businesses and major hotels that may make you feel like you're in Singapore, if you're there on a Saturday make sure you wander through Salcedo Market. It's an upmarket affair, relatively speaking, where you can grab some great local food and produce. Those hankering for excellent western food and a glimpse of Manila's long-lunching business-types should head to Apartment 1B on Lafayette Square. While you're never far from an urban vignette that contrasts with the central business district's gloss, it's best to plunge into another area of the city for more local color and flavor. A taxi ride away is Marikina City, home to some uniquely Manilan attractions. Once the shoe-making capital of the capital, you'll find Marikina Shoe Museum here. But it doesn't house just any old shoes. No, it's basically a celebration of the shoes of Imelda Marcos, the country's former first lady, who still deeply divides opinions among Filipinos. A bit kitsch, a bit weird, with over 605 pairs of her footwear (size eight and a half, if you must know) and a selection of photos of the former first lady with world leaders, complete with hilariously obsequious captions, it's a sight to behold. Snap back to reality with a moto-taxi ride to Marikina City's market. The covered lanes are a hive of stalls and intriguing local life. Heading back towards the central area of the city and Manila Bay, visit Cubao Expo. Located just off General Romulo Street it was formerly Marikina Shoe Expo, a mix of shoe outlets for nearby factories. Now the low-rise complex of boutiques, bars, galleries and antique shops has to be a contender for hippest spot in Manila, a city that doesn't bother itself too much with anything so affected. Relaxed and fun, it's a great place to while away a few hours. When the shops there close you can get some great local, homemade food, down a cocktail or Red Horse lager or two, and wind down away from the chaos of the streets and plot some evening entertainment. Later on, head to Makati, one of the main areas for bars of varying descriptions and clientele. saGuijo Cafe + Bar is one of the city's best for music. Attracting typically exuberant Manilan crowds, like all good live music venues it's got a comforting, grimy edge. It hosts bands playing all sorts of music, and, rare for Filipino bands, no covers. To push on through to the morning light, Embassy in Fort Bonifacio is the club with the most in-crowd hipsters queuing to get in. What are your favorite spots in Manila?

"(CNN) -- Liverpool youngster Suso has been fined $16,000 by the English Football Association (FA) after calling a teammate ""gay"" for getting his teeth whitened. The 19-year-old reacted to a photo that colleague Jose Enrique had posted on social networking site Twitter that showed him having treatment on his teeth. He posted: ""What f*** is he doing? This guy is gay... he does everything except play football."" Suso later deleted the tweet and has subsequently apologized. Enrique defended his teammate after news of the fine emerged, saying it was just ""banter"". ""'Is amazing how fa can fine my friend @suso30fernandez for a banter thing. Was just a joke!"" Enrique posted on his own Twitter site. Suso, who has made 13 appearances for Liverpool this season, has also been warned about his future conduct by the FA. A statement on their website read: ""Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing Liverpool's Jesus Fernandez Saez (Suso) has been fined Â£10,000 and warned as to his future conduct for a comment posted on Twitter. ""The charge, which the player admitted and requested a paper hearing, was that he acted in a way which was improper and/or brought the game into disrepute in that the comment was posted on his Twitter account and included a reference to a person/s sexual orientation and/or disability."" The sanctions meted out to Suso were welcomed by the Gay Football Supporters Network, but their chair Chris Basiurski said in a statement he thought the fine should go towards the fight against discrimination. ""We hope that it will continue to be a warning to people in the game that homophobic comments are not an acceptable form of banter and that people should take greater care when using social media. ""However, in a time where resources to fight discrimination in football are limited, we would like to see the monies received by The FA in fines reinvested in the fight against homophobia. ""Not only would it serve as an appropriate punishment for offences, but also provide a positive outcome, with the fines used to fund some of the important initiatives needed in the game to spread the inclusive message."" Suso apologized on Twitter after the FA's verdict. He said: ""I'm very sorry if anyone has been offended by my comments about the photo of my team-mate Jose Enrique. ""It was only a joke between the two of us. I realize that my words were unfortunate and it was not my intention to offend anyone. I apologize again if anyone was offended.""","Liverpool youngster Suso handed $16,000 fine by the English Football Association .

"(CNN) -- An intruder was shot and killed at the home of a deputy district attorney and her sheriff's-deputy husband in Hot Sulphur Springs, Colorado, just before midnight Monday, according to a statement from the Colorado Bureau of Investigations. Grand County Coroner Brenda Bock identified the man as Joshua Stevens, 31. It appears he was shot once in the head and several times in the torso. A full autopsy will be done Wednesday, she said. Bock told CNN she thinks Stevens was unarmed. He had moved to Colorado recently from Michigan, his father said. Stevens was living with friends while looking for a job. The deputy district attorney called police after the stranger caused a disturbance outside the front door of the couple's home, the news release said. The man tired to push his way into the home, and there was an altercation during which shots were fired. ""There are no apparent ties to recent shootings"" of other legal-system officials in Colorado and Texas, the statement said. It was unclear whether the deputy district attorney or her husband, a deputy with the Grand County Sheriff's Department, who shot the intruder.","NEW: Coroner says Joshua Stevens was shot once in head, several times in torso .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Truly appreciating the beauty of Paris is a pleasure that can't be hurried. Stop, breathe, appreciate and perhaps kiss in the romantic city of Paris. Take time to wander down its wide boulevards, savour every sip of strong, black coffee and resist the temptation to fall into step with the throng of tourists and sightseers. Our advice to anyone who finds themselves with 24 hours to spare in the French capital is to stop, breathe, appreciate and indulge. Start the day with a walk down the Champs-Élysées. For some, it retains the title of the world's most beautiful avenue. For others, the road's historical charm has been blighted by the arrival of global brands, traffic and tourists. Sunrise offers the history without the hurry. Take a leisurely stroll down its expansive pavements and look up for impressive architecture without fear of bumping into shoppers. Treat yourself to breakfast at one of Paris' oldest tea salons. Ladurée was founded as a family business in 1862 and now appears in luxurious locales in London, Monaco, Switzerland and Japan. The original, Ladurée Royale on Rue Royale, doesn't open until 8:30am (and later on Sundays), so for early morning pastries drop into the Champs-Elysees store which opens at 7:30am every day. The queues at Paris' most famous art gallery, the Louvre, are notorious so impatient visitors are advised to go to the Musée de l'Orangerie, set in the historic Jardin des Tuileries. You won't see the Mona Lisa, but the gallery does boast a collection of Claude Monet's Water Lilies. The queues are shorter the earlier you go and to really beat the crowds pre-book your time slot online. Head north to have your own images sketched by street artists in Montmartre, a former stomping ground for famous names including Salvador Dali, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. Drop into the Basilique du Sacré Coeur to pray, light a candle or simply enjoy the spectacular views over Paris. From there, visit Rue Lepic where you will find Café des Deux Moulins, where actress Audrey Tautou waited tables in the 2001 film ""Amélie."" Note that when you ask for a coffee in France, you'll automatically receive a black espresso. If you'd like something bigger and milkier, ask for a café au lait (already popular elsewhere) or café Americain (filter coffee) with milk (lait). Further down Rue Lepic you'll find Au Virage Lepic, a quaint bistro dripping in traditional Parisian atmosphere. It's usually crowded with locals so book in advance. Getting around is easy in Paris. Take a bus or the Metro or join the legion of cyclists on hugely popular Vélib rental bikes. Pick up your own bike at one of the service points scattered around the city. You'll need a credit card to register for a one-day subscription, or to speed up the process pre-book a one-day ticket online. It'll cost you one euro and the first 30 minutes of every journey for the next 24 hours is free. After than, any additional time will be charged to your credit card until you return the bike to any stand in the city. In the afternoon, walk -- or cycle -- down Boulevard Saint-Germain on the historic Left Bank. Discover your inner intellectual over a coffee or dinner at Les Deux Magots, a former meeting place for Paris' great literary minds including Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. From Boulevard Saint-Germain, walk down Rue Saint-Sulpice, past Saint-Sulpice, a striking church founded in the 1646 and brought to a new audience as one of the buildings featured in Dan Brown's best-selling novel (and subsequent film) ""The Da Vinci Code."" Wander further on to Rue de Sèvres where you can batter your credit card with some upmarket shopping at Le Bon Marché and La Grand Epicerie. In the evening, soak up some Parisian chic at the De La Ville Café on Boulevard Bonne Nouvelle, or indulge in the opulence of Hotel Costes on Rue Saint-Honore. Both serve food and close at 2am. Treat yourself to a glass of champagne and start planning your next sojourn in Paris!","It's difficult to truly appreciate Paris with one eye on your watch, so slow down!
Wander through its historic areas, still popular with artists and intellectuals .
Treat yourself to breakfast at Ladurée, end the day with champagne ."
"Port Sulphur, Louisiana (CNN) -- This Fourth of July weekend New Orleans will be packed with nearly 300,000 people, as the National Education Association holds its annual convention, and folks from across the country descend on the Crescent City for three days of partying and concerts featuring Mary J. Blige, Alicia Keys, Janet Jackson and Earth, Wind & Fire, all headliners at the 16th annual Essence Music Festival. But the residents in this rural town -- as well as others in Pointe a la Hache, the county seat of Plaquemines Parish -- too are concerned about the earth, wind and fire. Yet their thoughts are not about the musical group, but instead, the devastation being wreaked on their way of life in the region as a result of the BP oil catastrophe, the worst environmental disaster in American history. While local, state and federal officials throw as many resources as possible to prevent the millions of gallons leaked thus far from causing more damages to the beaches and coastline of the Gulf Coast, the residents here are under a heavy degree of stress. Some admittedly still facing down post-traumatic stress, a result of Hurricane Katrina five years ago, they now face the possibility of losing their livelihood as the oil makes its way to the east bank of the Mississippi River. The water means everything to the people here. The local economy is based entirely on the money earned from the fishing industry, and since May, the boats have been idled because of the oil disaster. I am here to shoot a special for my TV One Cable Network show, Washington Watch. This town is largely African American, and considering our network targets Blacks, it was an ideal place to focus our attention. But the heartache and strain I am hearing in Pointe a la Hache is the same in other towns, whether the faces are white, Hispanic, or Asian. It really is hard to fathom what this disaster will do to the residents here, many of them third-generation fishermen. The water is all they know, and if they can't make a living doing this, there really is nothing else to do. The countryside of southern Louisiana is gorgeous -- though the heat is stifling and the mosquitoes plentiful --but this is very much a coastal community. There are no massive shopping centers, large manufacturing facilities or high tech parks. The bottom line: No fishing; no money; no life. On Thursday evening, a number of the town's residents filed into the Greater Mt. Sinai Baptist Church in Port Sulphur for a community rally with the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. Prior to the meeting, several of the fisherman vented their frustration to the Rev. Tyronne Edwards, who has been a leading voice on the oil disaster here, and to Billy Nungesser, president of Plaquemines Parish. Nungesser told the fishermen, many dressed in T-shirts, jeans and work boots, that he feels their pain, and is doing everything he can to fight through the bureaucracy and get resources to the fishermen, namely jobs converting their fishing boats into skimmers to pick up the oil. ""This week they [BP] are supposed to put a whole 'nother crew of boats out and rotate some of them off on a 30-, 60-, 90-day [schedule] to get some money for the people that ain't been"" working, he said, who added that the outside contractors are being paid $3,000 a day for oil cleanup. ""What we are trying to do is get work for all of the fishermen full time."" Rev. Edwards, with a black and gold Bible in hand, said it's time for President Obama to come to small towns like Pointe a la Hache and hear firsthand from the men and women who are scraping by, angry with the bureaucracy that is preventing the resources from flowing. He is still seething from a meeting last week with Kenneth Feinberg, the Washington, D.C. attorney President Obama appointed to oversee the $20 billion fund BP established to assist victims of the disaster. ""This guy sounds like BP all the way,"" said Edwards, who didn't like what he said was Feinberg's suggestion to fishermen that it's best they take $100,000 now instead of trying to sue. ""He's detached,"" Nungesser chimed in. It's clear that frustration is running high, and whether it's BP, Gov. Bobby Jindal or President Obama, residents here are in unanimous agreement: they can do more, and it needs to be done now. One fisherman said that Plaquemines Parish is their home and they want to see it thrive, but things are reaching a boiling point. ""What do we have to do? Wreak havoc down here to get people's attention because that's what it's coming to."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Roland Martin: Residents of small rural town totally dependent on fishing industry .
He says their way of life is threatened by the Gulf oil disaster .
Martin: Stress is intense and people are getting frustrated by pace of cleanup effort ."
"(CNN) -- Emergency officials sifted through damage and debris scattered across roadways Saturday after a line of fast-moving storms and high winds swept through northwestern Wisconsin the night before, leaving at least one person dead and 39 others injured. Three people were critically injured and a second person died, though not as a result of the storm, Burnett County spokeswoman Dawn Sargent said. The storms also contributed to ""widespread power outages"" in a county with a population that normally swells to more than 80,000 people during the Fourth of July weekend. Burnett County's typical population is about 17,000. ""We ask nonresidents to avoid the area because of the road closures and the presence of emergency crews trying to clear debris from the roadways,"" Sargent added. Roughly three-quarters of the county have been affected, while its northern sections were more heavily hit. The towns of Grantsburg, Washburn, Danbury and Web Lake were among the hardest-hit areas, said Wisconsin's emergency management spokeswoman Rhonda Reynolds. ""Last night we were working, and at about 7 o'clock the winds really picked up,"" said Carinna Coy, an employee at T-Dawgs restaurant in Grantsburg. ""From what we could see today, there's a lot of trees that tipped over and a lot of roads that are closed. ""Main Street is a mess,"" she added. A hardware store owner in neighboring Washburn described gusty winds, heavy rains and lightning that preceded power outages. ""Power's been out in parts of Washburn for most of the day, though they say that hopefully it'll be back soon,"" Nate Swiston of Washburn Hardware said. An aerial survey of the region revealed storm damage to homes and downed trees throughout the region. Officials said Saturday that they are focused on looking for trapped residents and distributing food, water and emergency medical supplies. The American Red Cross also opened a meals station for the general public at the Grantsburg Middle School, Sargent said. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: 39 people have been injured, 3 of them critically .

"(CNN) -- Football's lawmakers have taken the historic step of unanimously approving goal-line technology systems for use in the sport. World soccer's global governing body FIFA and the International Football Association Board (IFAB) made the announcement following a meeting in Zurich on Thursday. FIFA intend for goal-line technology to be used at December's Club World Cup in Japan, and if successful it will also be implemented at the 2013 African Cup of Nations and the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Two systems, designed by technology companies GoalRef and Hawk-Eye, have been approved after going through two phases of FIFA testing. UEFA chief opposed to goal-line technology . FIFA president Sepp Blatter had previously opposed the move but said the turning point had been an incident at the 2010 World Cup involving a second round clash between England and Germany. Blatter was present when midfielder Frank Lampard's shot bounced well over the goal-line but was not awarded by the officials in a match England went on to lose 4-1. ""It is a real approach of modern times in football,"" he told reporters. ""It is so important because the objective in football is to score goals. It's a help for the referee. ""I'm happy, I'm pleased we are able to go forward. When it comes to high level competition and you have the technology and you don't use it something is wrong. ""I have changed my attitude towards technology because of Lampard's kick in South Africa. That was the moment for me to say 'You are the president of FIFA and you cannot afford that in the next World Cup something similar will happen.'"" The English Premier League welcomed the news, expressing its intention to bring in goal-line technology in the near future. ""The Premier League has been a long-term advocate of goal line technology,"" read a statement on the organization's website. ""We will engage in discussions with both Hawk-Eye and GoalRef in the near future with a view to introducing goal-line technology as soon as is practically possible."" The IFAB is comprised of FIFA and the four UK-based football associations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is a body which decides on any proposed changes to the rules of soccer. Blog: Will FIFA regret opening technology can of worms? The announcement follows Blatter's recent calls for goal-line technology to be introduced in reaction to an incident that occurred during Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine. Co-hosts Ukraine saw a goal not given during a must-win group-stage match with England, when John Terry cleared Artim Milevskiy's shot after it looked to have crossed the line. Following the game on June 19, Blatter used his official Twitter account to declare: ""After last night's match #GLT is no longer an alternative but a necessity."" But his stance on the issue is at odds with Michel Platini, the president of European football's governing body UEFA. The UEFA chief told CNN in May: ""I'm against the technology. If you say OK to goal-line technology, then it is offside technology, then penalty area technology, and we stop the football. ""I want human people -- it's easy. I understand the fans because they want justice but with an additional referee we have the same justice."" In addition to Milevskiy's ""goal"" at Euro 2012, England have been involved in one other high-profile goal-line controversies. In the 1966 World Cup final, England were awarded a goal against West Germany when Geoff Hurst's shot in extra-time rebounded off the underside of the crossbar. England went on to win the match 4-2 at Wembley. At the same meeting, FIFA also confirmed it would permit the wearing of headscarves during a trial period. As there was no medical risk to wearing headscarves when playing a game of football, it has decided to relent on a ban introduced in 2007. Soccer's governing body had prevented teams wearing the traditional headscarves -- which protect the modesty of Islamic girls and women -- for safety reasons and to prevent political or religious statements.","Goal-line technology approved for use in football on Thursday .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Whether entrenched in business meetings or stuck on a layover, you may find yourself in Chicago with limited time to spare. But this vibrant city has so much to offer that it's worth using every free moment to see something new. Here are some of the things I managed slip in on a recent business trip to Chicago. Underneath the ""Cloud Gate"" sculpture, the perspective gets distorted in the reflection. Museum: The famous Art Institute of Chicago (111 S. Michigan Ave.) has enough rooms of artwork to keep a person exploring for days; unfortunately, I got there just before it closed at 5 p.m. Still, it was worth a peek. In 15 minutes, you can see the impressive gallery of Impressionists, including Renoir and Monet, and dash through to some of the nearby rooms to glimpse medieval religious art. Allot more time to explore, if your schedule allows! For those who plan a little better, a number of works by painter Edvard Munch, famous for ""The Scream,"" are on display until April 26. Public art: Hey, look, it's a giant bean! Just a few blocks north of the Art Institute, this gigantic reflective sculpture called ""Cloud Gate"" weighs 110 tons, stands 33 feet high and is made of stainless steel plates. British artist Anish Kapoor designed it with liquid mercury in mind, says the Millennium Park Web site. Chances are, there's probably a bunch of tourists taking pictures of themselves reflected in it. International food: Chicago has a plethora of cuisines from around the world. For my first dinner, I went to the Berghoff (17 W. Adams St.), a German restaurant near Millennium Park downtown. Even if you're alone, this is a fine place to sit at the bar, munching delicious wiener schnitzel and potatoes, and have casual conversations with the locals. The service is excellent, so if you're in a rush, you'll probably make your next appointment. Bonus: Take the famous El train back to your hotel; there's a stop right on Adams Street. Views: Night has fallen, and so has the temperature, but the adventure is just beginning. For a breathtaking view of the surroundings, take the fast elevator up to the Signature Room at the 95th in the John Hancock building (875 N. Michigan Ave.) and ponder the panoramic scenery over cocktails and snacks in the lounge on the 96th floor. The Chicago area is so flat that you can see for miles: endless rows of streetlights extending into the horizon. A chocolate martini and a view like that go well together. Music: If you're still restless and eager for adventure, head to a different neighborhood. Lincoln Park, a trendy area north of downtown, has a slew of bars that cater to the young and the young at heart. Duffy's Tavern (420½ W. Diversey Parkway) will have either a live band or the standard selection of pop music. The local beer on tap, called 312 after the city's area code, has a refreshing lemon-wheat taste. Movies: Can't sleep? Now that you've seen some of the city, maybe you'll recognize it in films. Chicago locals seem extremely proud of the presence of their city in last summer's Batman hit, ""The Dark Knight."" Try watching it on mute so you can focus on the scenery rather than the shooting, and maybe that will help you doze off. Pizza: Don't leave Chicago without trying some of the famous deep-dish pizza. I was rushing to make my flight, but fortunately Giordano's (various locations throughout the city) accepts take-out orders half an hour in advance, even in the morning. Since there was a huge line for dinner the night before, in the morning I ended up ordering ahead and then eating half of it right there at the restaurant while my colleagues unhurriedly ordered at the table. Before their food came, I ran to get a taxi to the airport with pizza box in hand. Update: Airport security did not question the cheesy goodness oozing in the box in my carry-on bag. The next day, the pizza took at least half an hour to reheat, but it was still pretty tasty.","Paintings by Edvard Munch, famous for ""The Scream,"" are at the Art Institute .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Police in Brazil have arrested a third person in connection with the rape of an American woman on a minibus in Rio de Janeiro. Carlos Armando Costa dos Santos was arrested Monday night, police said. The woman boarded the minibus with another tourist in the Copacabana beach district in Rio de Janeiro early Saturday. Three men subsequently boarded the minibus and forced off all the other passengers, police said. The woman was raped, and the other tourist, a man, was held captive and robbed, authorities said. Their credit cards were used at multiple locations inside and outside of Rio de Janeiro over a span of hours, the police said in a statement. According to Brazilian newspapers, the man was handcuffed and beaten, while the woman was repeatedly raped. The two were dumped in Itaborai, a city more than 30 miles (about 50 kilometers) away, after six hours, O Globo newspaper said. Earlier, police arrested two men, both in their early 20s. They are Jonathan Foudakis de Souza and Wallace Aparecido Souza Silva. The U.S. Consulate is in contact with the victim and is providing all appropriate consular assistance, said a State Department official, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to talk about the case . The rape highlights security concerns in the Brazilian city that will host matches in the 2014 World Cup and will put on the Summer Olympics two years later. ' As more women come forward saying they were victims of similar attacks, Rio de Janeiro's Civil Police Chief Martha Rocha issued a written apology. She also fired two police officers responsible for handling rape cases. Rio has gone a long way toward cleaning up its image as one of Latin America's most violent cities. But Brazilian media already are drawing parallels between this attack and the infamous gang rape of a young woman on a bus in India.","A foreign tourist is kidnapped, raped and robbed on a minibus .

"(CNN) -- The information age has made it easier to find instructions for anything -- even how to extract the deadly poison ricin from castor beans. At least 10 ricin-laced or suspected ricin-laced letters have been sent to government officials in recent weeks, including President Barack Obama. Should the public be alarmed? Not necessarily, analysts say. Just because castor beans and instructions of how to extract ricin are readily available doesn't mean this toxin is easy to produce or effective, they say. Fast facts about ricin . ""The recipe for it is easily accessible on the Internet,"" CNN national security analyst Fran Townsend said Thursday on ""Piers Morgan Live."" ""The basic recipe is not so hard; what's difficult is weaponizing it."" Even if a pinpoint of ricin is ingested, it can be fatal within days. And there is no cure. But mailing some poison in an envelope makes for a crude weapon, Townsend said. Former New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton put it more bluntly: ""Ricin is probably one of the worst ways to try and kill somebody."" He added, ""It's intended, I think, to attract publicity -- which it certainly is -- and to potentially intimidate."" This week, authorities were interviewing a man in New Boston, Texas, in connection with ricin-tainted letters sent to Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a person with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Also, the FBI announced Thursday its agents are looking for a letter sent to the CIA that they believe is similar to other letters, mailed from Spokane, Washington, that contained ricin. What is ricin? In April, letters were sent to Obama; Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County, Mississippi. James Everett Dutschke of Tupelo, Mississippi, has been charged with possession and use of a biological agent in connection with that case. Before this recent spate of suspected ricin letters, eight people had been arrested in the United States since 9/11 for attempting to make the poison with the intent of using it for an act of politically motivated violence, according to terrorism data collected by the New America Foundation. But only two of those individuals succeeded in producing the ricin. In short, ricin is a poor choice for someone trying to inflict mass casualties because it must be directly injected or ingested in some way by the victim, CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen wrote recently. Only one person, a Bulgarian dissident who died in 1978, appears to have been a victim of a successful ricin attack in more than three decades, according to Bergen. It remains unclear what the motivation is behind the recent letters. The letter sent to Bloomberg -- and an additional one sent to a gun control group he founded -- contained what could be described as an overzealous pro-gun position. ""You will have to kill me and my family before you get my guns,"" the letters said, a law enforcement official told CNN. ""Anyone wants to come to my house will be shot in the face. The right to bear arms is my constitutional God-given right and I will exercise that right 'til the day I die. What's in this letter is nothing compared to what I've got planned for you,"" the note inside each envelope said, according to the official. CNN obtained a copy of the letter sent to mayors' gun control group, postmarked May 20 in Shreveport, Louisiana, and the wording matched the account provided by the law enforcement official. The letter addressed to Obama that was intercepted Wednesday appeared similar to these letters. The suspected ricin letters in Washington state appear to be a separate incident. These letters were sent to a federal judge, a Spokane post office, Obama and the Fairchild Air Force Base, the FBI said. The FBI confirmed Friday the presence of ricin on the letter sent to the Air Force base near Spokane, the agency said. There are similarities between these letters and one that authorities are looking for that was sent to the CIA, officials said. Matthew Ryan Buquet, 37, was arrested last week in connection with the letter sent to the judge, which contained a message threatening to kill him. CNN's Greg Botelho, Jim Acosta, Carol Cratty, Dana Bash, Ted Barrett and Alex Mooney contributed to this report.","Suspected ricin-laced letters have proliferated in recent weeks .

"(CNN) -- A former justice of the peace now faces capital murder charges in the killings of two Texas prosecutors and the wife of one of them, authorities announced Thursday. Eric Williams' bail has been set at $23 million in the March killings of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, and the January slaying of Mark Hasse, one of McLelland's assistant district attorneys. Williams was already in jail on a charge of threatening investigators probing the killings, and his wife had been charged with murder on Wednesday. ""The murder of a public official, such as a judge a prosecutor or a law-enforcement officer, is an assault on all the people of the state, because it's an attack of the rule of law,"" said Kirby Dendy, chief of the Texas Rangers. Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrnes said the killings stemmed from Williams' ""past legal problems with the criminal justice system of this county"" -- a 2012 conviction on burglary and theft charges that led to his removal from office. His wife, Kim Williams, was booked early Wednesday on murder charges. She confessed in detail to her involvement in the scheme and implicated her husband as the trigger man, according to court papers. Byrnes said Eric Williams fired the fatal shots in both slayings. In Hasse's death, Kim Williams was the getaway driver; in the McLellands' killings, she was a passenger, ""and Eric did the killing."" ""We do not believe there were any other major actors in this case,"" Byrnes said. Hasse and Mr. McLelland both believed that Eric Williams blamed them for his removal from office, a sheriff's sergeant noted in Kim Williams' arrest paperwork. The prosecutors carried handguns for their protection after the Williams trial ""because they believed Eric Williams to be a threat to their personal safety."" Eric Williams was arrested last week on a count of making a terroristic threat. A sheriff's affidavit accused him of using his home computer to threaten police investigating the McLellands' killings. Eric Williams' attorney released a statement Friday saying he ""has cooperated with law enforcement and vigorously denies any and all allegations. He wishes simply to get on with his life and hopes that the perpetrators are brought to justice."" Investigation opens window on 2012 trial .

"(CNN) -- Two years ago, the Supreme Court upended the rules for campaign finance, unleashing a tsunami of unregulated, unrestricted and undisclosed spending that has, in effect, allowed donors to buy elections. The full impact of this decision is just now becoming clear, and it's bad both for America's businesses and for our democracy. By a 5-4 majority, the Supreme Court affirmed that money is essentially speech -- a notion first addressed in Buckley v. Valeo in 1976 -- and it outlawed nearly all restrictions on independent spending by corporations or other groups, including unions, to influence elections. Such restrictions are unconstitutional violations of free speech, the court said, and are prohibited by the First Amendment. You might expect business owners to welcome the elimination of these restrictions, but if so, you're about to be surprised. A recent poll conducted by Lake Research found that 66% of a random sample of 500 small-business owners believe the Citizens United decision was ""mostly bad"" or ""somewhat bad"" for small business. Since small businesses create 70% of new jobs in the private sector, according to the Small Business Administration, their view should matter a lot. The poll was commissioned by the American Sustainable Business Council, the Main Street Alliance, and Small Business Majority -- three groups that represent the views of small business and which have a combined membership of more than 100,000 small businesses nationwide. The poll tapped the views of 500 small-business owners nationwide, most of whom are not members of the organizations conducting the survey. In addition to taking a dim view of Citizens United, 88% of the small-business owners in the poll had a negative view of the role money plays in politics. (The margin of error in the poll is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.) Do small donations still matter in politics? Tell us what you think. Small-business owners believe in our market-based, capitalist system, which depends on open and robust competition. Unlimited campaign spending undermines this competition, in three crucial ways. First, allowing unlimited money into politics allows the past to hold the future hostage. Companies (and individuals who own them) with sufficient resources to sway elections often represent the industries and companies of the past, rather than the industries and companies that are creating the future. The evidence on this is indirect, because since Citizens United was announced less than a year before the last federal election, its impact has not yet been fully felt or measured. However, we can gauge its future impact by looking at lobbying expenditures, for which multiyear data is widely available. For the period 2008-2011, the computer and Internet industry -- a wellspring of innovation -- spent $458 million on lobbying, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, while the energy and natural resources industry spent more than three times as much: $1.55 billion. The ratio for election-related spending, post Citizens United, will likely be similar. Second, allowing unlimited money in politics allows the big to achieve an unfair advantage over the small. This is ironic in light of the huge role small business plays in creating private sector jobs in America, even as some large corporations act as net destroyers of American jobs, when outsourcing and offshoring are factored in. For example, this kind of money in politics gives power to the push by big companies to repatriate offshore profits, giving some big and profitable multinational corporations lower effective tax rates than the grocer on Main Street. Moreover, unlimited contributions give major Wall Street firms the edge over community banks, because the big banks can win loan guarantees, taxpayer bailouts and deeply discounted borrowing rates that smaller banks can't touch. Third, allowing unlimited money in politics allows companies to collect IOUs for special favors from presidential candidates -- particularly as a result of contributions made early in the election season, when a few million dollars can swing the result in a small state like New Hampshire. America's small-business owners embrace competition -- but they demand the competition be open, robust and vigorous. They don't want to be whipped by big corporations that bought an unfair advantage from senators, congressional representatives and other elected officials. When that happens, it's bad for business and America. Many solutions have been proposed, ranging from the Supreme Court reversing its decision, to legislation, to a constitutional amendment. Momentum for change is growing, as candidates from both political parties learn what it's like to have a campaign with broad public support crushed by a single individual with deep pockets who steps in to help the other side. Citizens United is an assault on our economy, which is supposed to be based on vigorous, free and open competition. It's time for us to reinvigorate our economy by getting government out of the protection racket, and preventing industries and companies from buying special favors. We must undo the damage wrought by Citizens United. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter. Join the conversation on Facebook.

"Epernay (CNN) -- French presidential frontrunner Francois Hollande chose to spend the final day of his first round campaign in the Ardenne, an area famous for that most Gallic of luxuries -- champagne. Some of the vintners he met there may well be disappointed to learn the Socialist candidate chose not to crack open that ceremonial bottle of bubbly after sailing to victory on April 22. CNN was informed he toasted with red wine instead. With 28.6% of the initial vote, Hollande will be pitted against incumbent conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy's 27.2% in a run off on May 6. Does Sarkozy need a miracle? Before the final showdown, each side will try to win support from the eight other parties who failed to make the cut. Key to their success will be proposals to tackle immigration, the eurozone crisis and, above all, France's domestic economy. High times, hard times . Nestled in the north east of the country, near the border with Belgium, France's champagne belt provides a unique glimpse into one of Europe's most protected agrarian economies. The region is something of a national treasure while also being heavily reliant on exports abroad. At its heart is the picturesque town of Epernay. The champagne business is big money. Revenues last year amounted to €4.4 billion ($5.8 billion). And despite finances being fragile these days, the champagne industry's trade body, the Committee Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne, says the world quaffed around 323 million bottles of the stuff last year. But champagne producers remain aware of potential challenges on the horizon. Sarkozy relishes tough battle . ""How can I put it?"" says Claude Giraud, owner of the 300-year-old champagne house -- or ""maison"" -- Henri Giraud. ""To make champagne you need good weather, good soil, good grapes but you also need a good economic climate."" Giraud's firm has survived two world wars and one revolution. Now into its 12th generation, centuries of investment have left the family well placed to weather the storm. Annual revenues reach around $4 million. But with net income only hitting a tenth of that figure, making this finite commodity isn't cheap. Only 33,500 hectares of prize vineyards can give rise to the wine that will ultimately become champagne. Just three varieties of grape are used: One white and two red. Though the actual process of making the champagne may be standardized, the (often secret) blends are not --thus leading to a plethora of distinct champagnes to sample for anyone lucky enough to visit the region. Pricey to drink and expensive to make . Producing champagne requires extensive experience, and the bottles must mature for three to six -- sometimes even nine -- years before consumption. The result: A vibrant wine carrying the promise of high labor and storage costs. Not to mention concerns about varying levels of stock from one year to the next. Over a glass of his fresh and fruity Cuvee ""Exception"" Grand Cru ($40 a bottle) Jean-Michel Lagneau explains why, after 20 years at prestige houses like Krug, Ruinart and Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin, he decided to go it alone. ""My wife, Agnes, and I are from this region. Our family had land and it made sense. We were passionate and convinced we could make great wines,"" he said. Economy: French election's unspoken issue . And the Lagneaus are finally reaping what they sowed. After six years of hefty investment, Champagne Paul-Etienne Saint Germain is posting a profit. Into only their third year of trade, the Lagneaus now count top hotel groups among their clients, like Relais & Chateaux and the Leading Hotels of the World. Bon viveurs in Paris can find Paul-Etienne Saint Germain on top tables, like Pierre Gagnaire's eponymous culinary mecca in the 8th arrondissement, a winner of 3 Michelin stars. What Lagneau would really like to see from the next French government is support for those who take risks to start a business. With ambitions to expand his foreign customer base, Lagneau also reckons the viability and stability of the common currency are crucial. ""We need the euro. As champagne producers France isn't the only market for us. Much of the champagne we make in this region is sold elsewhere,"" he said. Wine of kings and the king of wines . Last year, six out of the top 10 foreign markets for the luxury liquor were outside the eurozone. The rest include supposedly cash-strapped countries like Spain and Italy, which also make their own rival sparkling wines. Yet France still has the biggest thirst for its royal nectar. In 2011 domestic demand swallowed 56% of bottles sold. As such, talk by Hollande of a 75% tax on the nation's wealthiest citizens risks eroding demand for Champagne in its target market. How DSK sex scandal boosted Sarkozy rival . ""It will probably not hurt the big fortunes too much but effectively it's a concern,"" concedes Lagneau. Giraud is more philosophical. If anything, he says, unlike his latest vintage this year's elections have left him rather flat. ""No one seems to be tackling the real issues that matter to people,"" he said. Both Sarkozy and Hollande aim to balance the books but they differ on how to achieve that goal. The center-right says controlling spending is the way forward whereas those on the left would rather focus on growth. The one thing they do agree on -- much to Giraud's delight -- is a proposed tax on financial transactions, which the winemaker says should rein in ""speculators who do nothing to contribute or support France's economy.'' The economist John Maynard Keynes, famed for encouraging governments to spend their way back to health, once quipped that his ""only regret in life"" was that he ""didn't drink enough champagne."" Champagne socialists the world over -- or the Gauche Caviar in France -- have often trotted out his rhetoric as justification for splashing the cash during a downturn. So, is France ready for its first left-wing leader in 17 years? ""I'm not sure,"" muses Giraud. ""Mind you, it could be a bit like Champagne. It's cold up here and we make white wine out of red."" He adds: ""On paper it shouldn't work but somehow it does and now this region is rich.""

She enjoyed a close friendship and working relationship with the late U.S. President Ronald Reagan, with whom she shared similar conservative views. Thatcher retired from public life after a stroke in 2002 and suffered several strokes after that. She makes few public appearances. Thatcher missed a reception in honor of her 85th birthday hosted by Prime Minister David Cameron in October 2010 and skipped the unveiling of a statue of Reagan in London in July last year.

"(CNN) -- Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain may have suffered Champions League heartache this season, but both clubs are poised to return to Europe's top competition as winners of their domestic leagues. Juve fell flat in the quarterfinals against Bayern Munich, losing both games 2-0, but Antonio Conte's team moved to within four points of clinching the Italian Serie A crown by beating AC Milan 1-0 on Sunday. A 57th-minute penalty by Arturo Vidal, after substitute goalkeeper Marco Amelia sent Kwadwo Asamoah tumbling, was enough to keep the Turin side 11 points clear following second-placed Napoli's earlier victory. It was Juve's 24th win from 33 league games, with just four defeats. ""It wasn't a great match but we won and that's what counts,"" Vidal said, as Juve seek to retain the Scudetto. ""Next Sunday we've got the derby against Torino and we have to prepare well for it. Winning the next two games would wrap up the title."" Third-placed Milan dropped seven points behind in the race for the second automatic qualification place for the Champions League, as Napoli beat Cagliari 3-2. Fiorentina closed to within a point of Milan with a 4-3 win at home to Torino, maintaining a five-point buffer over fifth-placed Inter Milan with five games to play. Inter won 1-0 against Parma thanks to a late goal from 35-year-old striker Tommaso Rocchi, his second this month, which sealed the 2010 European champions' first home victory in four games. The French title race is also nearly over following PSG's 3-0 victory over 10-man Nice on Sunday. PSG, seeking a first championship in 19 years after exiting the Champions League on away goals against Barcelona, now lead second-placed Marseille by nine points with five matches left. Zlatan Ibrahimovic took his league-leading goal tally to 27 this season with a penalty following Jeremy Menez's 10th-minute opener, while Clement Chantome wrapped it up late on. Nice had goalkeeper David Ospina sent off for bringing down Ezequiel Lavezzi, which set up Ibrahimovic's 65th-minute spotkick. In Spain, Atletico Madrid kept up the pressure on second-placed city rivals Real Madrid as striker Radamel Falcao scored the only goal in a 1-0 win at Sevilla on Sunday. The Colombian diverted in Raul Garcia's cross, despite an apparent handball in the build-up, to net his 25th in La Liga this season -- putting him third behind real's Cristiano Ronaldo (31) and Barcelona's Lionel Messi (43). The win kept Atletico three points behind Real and 16 behind Barca, who both won on Saturday. Fourth-placed Real Sociedad drew 0-0 at Osasuna to be two points clear of Valencia in the race for Spain's final Champions League berth.","Sunday's win over AC Milan keeps Juventus 11 points clear in Italy .

"Columbus, Ohio (CNN) -- President Barack Obama pledged Wednesday that the Social Security system won't be privatized while he is in the White House. In a town-hall style meeting with a few dozen residents of Columbus, Ohio, Obama said ""modest"" changes can keep the government pension system solvent for decades. Republicans have called for transforming the government program to a private savings account as a way to help keep it going as America's aging population stresses its financial health. ""It will not be privatized as long as I'm president,"" Obama said to applause, noting that the economic recession and Wall Street collapse would have devastated the savings of retirees under a privatized Social Security system. He said Social Security needed adjustments, rather than a total overhaul. ""There are some fairly modest changes that can be made without any newfangled schemes that can keep it running for 75 years so everybody gets what they deserve,"" Obama said. While citing steps his administration has taken to spur recovery from the recession, Obama also warned that more work needed to be done. He said the housing market remains a ""big drag"" on the economy and will take more time to recover. Overbuilding in the boom years that preceded the economic recession has resulted in too many houses available for the level of demand, the president said. ""It is going to take time to absorb this inventory that is just too high,"" Obama said. ""There's no quick way to do it."" Before the meeting, Obama huddled around the kitchen table with the Columbus family of Rhonda and Joe Weithman to talk about how his administration's economic stimulus spending has helped it. The Recovery Act funded local infrastructure projects like a new police station that provided work for the small architectural firm co-owned by Joe Weithman, helping it stay in business, Obama said. In addition, the administration subsidized COBRA health insurance benefits, which allowed Rhonda Weithman to maintain the family's insurance coverage after she lost her job, he said. The trip was Obama's ninth to Ohio since taking office. Ohio will likely be a key state in upcoming elections. Later Wednesday, Obama was to attend a fundraiser for Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, before heading to Miami Beach, Florida, for events with Senate candidate Kendrick Meek and gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink. On Tuesday, Obama held a round-table discussion with three Seattle, Washington, business owners -- an innkeeper, a baker and a pizza maker.  The president cited how each has been helped by his administration's policies intended to spur recovery from the recession. He also renewed his call for the U.S. Senate to pass a jobs bill aimed at helping small businesses. Senate Republicans have filibustered the measure, which would provide tax breaks for small businesses and expand available capital to them through local banks. Obama insisted the Senate would take up the bill again immediately after returning from its August recess. The measure would provide immediate help to small-business owners, who are the backbone of the U.S. economy, Obama said. ""They are who this bill is for,"" he said of the Seattle-area small-business owners who flanked him. ""They will see the benefits right away."" The Small Business Jobs and Credit Act, stalled in the Senate, would authorize the creation of a $30 billion lending fund. The Treasury Department would run the program, which would deliver ultra-cheap capital to community banks, defined as those with less than $10 billion in total assets. Other key components of the bill would provide $12 billion worth of tax relief for small businesses between 2010 and 2020, according to a preliminary estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation. The bill also would increase Small Business Administration loan limits and extend loan sweeteners through the end of the year. It would offer a slew of tax cuts for small businesses to encourage both investment and entrepreneurship. And the legislation would provide $1.5 billion in grants to state lending programs that can't turn to empty state coffers for more cash.","NEW: Obama says modest changes can save Social Security .

"(CNN) -- Three days after Syrian government forces seized control of the strategically important city of Qusayr, aid workers remained unable Saturday to enter the region, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. ""As of today, ICRC still doesn't have permission to enter Qusayr region and will continue to make all efforts to obtain access as and when security allows,"" spokesman Ewan Watson said in a statement. The U.N. Security Council had urged on Friday that Syrian authorities let humanitarian reach the town. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said this week that it had received reports that as many as 1,500 wounded civilians were trapped in Qusayr, which endured nearly seven weeks of fighting until government forces gained control on Wednesday. The Syrian Network for Human Rights reported that almost 600 of the wounded were unable to walk. Many were trapped in narrow areas near the city, the network said. The ICRC said that, over the past two days, the Lebanese Red Cross transferred 39 Syrians to receive emergency medical care. The casualties were already on Lebanese territory and were not taken across the border by the Red Cross, Watson said. In the village of Eastern Bowaiyda in Homs province, where many of those displaced by fighting in al Qusayr have sought shelter, clashes erupted between rebels and Syrian troops after the government forces tried to latter attempted to advance on the area, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Saturday that the army had restored stability to the region. Most of those who fled Qusayr to Lebanon are women and children. ""Those we have spoken to say it is unsafe to flee with men, who are at heightened risk of being arrested or killed at checkpoints along the way,"" said Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the U.N.'s refugee agency, earlier this week. Fleming said one woman told the agency that Qusayr residents were facing a stark choice: ""You leave and risk being killed ... or you stay and face a certainty of being killed."" Fighters from Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese Shiite militia backed by Iran and the Syrian government, were involved in the takeover. The loss of what had been a rebel stronghold near the Lebanese border represented a blow to rebels' efforts to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and may portend heightened sectarian tensions. The government's control of the city helps secure a critical link between the capital, Damascus, and Alawite strongholds such as Tartus and Latakia, said Charles Lister, an analyst at IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre. He predicted that the manly Sunni rebels' loss would spark a rise in cross-border attacks on Shiite towns in eastern Lebanon and possible attacks on Hezbollah forces farther inside the country. More than 70,000 Syrians -- most of them civilians -- have been killed in the two-year conflict, according to the United Nations. The growing need in Syria was underscored Friday when the United Nations made its largest appeal ever -- for more than $5 billion -- for relief aid to Syrians across the country. ""Syria as a civilization is unraveling, with as many as half of its citizens in need of urgent help as a result of this savage conflict,"" said Antonio Guterres, the world body's high commissioner for refugees, who announced the goal in Geneva. ""The funds we are appealing for are a matter of survival for suffering Syrians, and they are essential for neighboring countries that are hosting refugees."" More than 1.6 million Syrians have fled the country since the conflict began in March 2011; another 4.25 million are estimated to have been displaced inside it. The announcement came as the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs predicted that 3.45 million inside Syria could have crossed its borders by the end of the year and another 6.8 million people remaining inside Syria will need aid. That's nearly half of the nation, which has a population of 22.5 million. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","Still no access to aid 3 days after government forces take the city .

"London (CNN) -- Sub-zero temperatures continued to keep eastern Europe in their grip Wednesday, leading to the deaths of 31 people in Ukraine so far, emergency officials there said. For several days, unusually cold weather and snow have slammed Eastern Europe, as well as other parts of Europe and central and western Turkey. CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said the heart of the cold air was still centered over Eastern Europe Wednesday, including Russia, Romania, Belarus and Poland as well as Ukraine, with temperatures generally a couple of degrees lower Wednesday than the day before. The Romanian capital, Bucharest, saw a low of -23 degrees Celsius (-9.4 degrees Fahrenheit) early Wednesday, compared with an average low of -4 degrees Celsius (25 degrees Fahrenheit) at this time of year. Ukraine's capital, Kiev, was shivering at -22 degrees Celsius (-7.6 degree Fahrenheit), with the mercury expected to drop to -31 degrees Celsius (-23.8 degree Fahrenheit) during the night. Most of the dead in Ukraine were homeless but some people died in their homes, the country's Emergencies Ministry said. The death toll has risen sharply since two days ago, the ministry said. Almost 700 people have also been hospitalized with injuries related to the freeze. In several regions of Ukraine, including Kiev, entire housing complexes have been left without electricity or heating because of power failures. Schools are likely to close Thursday as temperatures are expected to drop below -24 degrees Celsius (-11.2 degrees Fahrenheit), officials said. The Emergencies Ministry is doing everything possible to combat the weather and has set up 1,600 heating centers across the country to assist people without power or heating, it said. Temperatures could drop at the weekend to -30 degrees Celsius (-22 degrees Fahrenheit) in the daytime, the ministry warned. The health ministry said most of the deaths had occurred in eastern Ukraine, in the city of Donetsk and adjacent towns and villages. In Poland, five people died overnight, taking the total number of deaths to 15 since the icy weather rolled in Friday, the publicly-funded Polish Radio's news website reported Wednesday. Most of those who died were homeless. Elsewhere, the bad weather was blamed for the sinking of a cargo ship carrying scrap metal off Turkey's Black Sea coast late Tuesday. Divers, helicopters and coast guard ships have been scrambled in an effort to find eight missing crew members from the Cambodian-flagged ship Vera. In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, the municipality mobilized nearly 2,600 personnel and more than 870 vehicles to try to keep roads open, as snow reached depths of up to 38 centimeters (1.2 feet). The unusual snowfall forced the cancellation and delay of scores of flights, as visibility was occasionally reduced to less than 50 meters (164 feet) mid-morning Wednesday. Istanbul also suspended its high-speed sea bus service, which ferries passengers up and down the Bosphorus Strait and stretches of the Marmara Sea. According to the Istanbul municipality's website, at least 378 homeless citizens have been brought to shelters and hotels to escape the freezing temperatures. One man died when he fell in a well that was covered by snow moments after having his photo taken in the record snow, the mayor's office said. More snow and bitter cold temperatures are expected Thursday from Edirne to Istanbul, with the heaviest snowfall expected in the Marmara region. Turkey's cold spell is forecast to ease Friday. The cold air also pushed westward Wednesday, with Paris dipping to -5 degrees Celsius (23 degrees Fahrenheit). The French capital may not top the freezing mark until the middle of next week, said Miller. In Italy, several professional soccer matches have been canceled or postponed due to the icy weather, according to Italy's ANSA news agency. One weather-related death, that of a one-year-old child trapped in a car swept into a gully, has been reported in Siracusa, Sicily, the news agency said. The cold will not loosen its grip on most of continental Europe until next week, Miller said, although parts of southeastern Europe and the Balkans could see temperatures begin to moderate on Friday as a result of a low pressure system moving in from the Mediterranean Sea. This system will also dump heavy snowfall in the Balkans, mirroring the recent snow storm which ushered in the cold blast for many locations in southeast Europe. Journalist Alexey Yaroshevsky and CNN's Talia Kayali, Laura Smith-Spark and Theo Nikolaou contributed to this report.","The heart of the cold air is centered over Eastern Europe, a CNN meteorologist says .

"(CNN) -- We've seen deaths, weddings, dramatic costume changes, surprise hookups and more deaths. And that's just in the past five years or so. The world of superhero comics has seen a lot of changes recently, with the demise -- and in some cases, resurrection - of Robin, Captain America, Peter Parker, Professor Charles Xavier and the Human Torch. Clark Kent walked out on his job and dated Wonder Woman. There have been revelations that multiple characters were gay, along with a same-sex wedding or two. (There also was a complete reboot in 2011 for DC Comics, which like CNN is owned by Time Warner, and a relaunch of many of Marvel Comics' books in 2012.) So, what's behind all these headline-grabbing plot twists in comic books these days? We have asked some of the creators over the years. Scott Snyder, who writes ""Batman,"" including the most recent ""Death of the Family"" story arc, said he writes stories as if this was his one chance to write about a certain character: ""It's not so much to make the books as dramatic as possible or to be shocking, but to try to tell the best story you can that feels organic. It's not been a marching order (from editors)."" When the Human Torch died in a 2010 issue of ""Fantastic Four"" (only to return a year later), Marvel editor Tom Brevoort spoke to CNN about deaths in comics, ""It's very easy to develop cynicism about the stories we tell. The only way to combat and conquer it is to have a story that touches on the humanness of people that has emotional resonance and truth to it. The fact of death is something every human being can relate to. I would argue that a well-told story of a character's demise is not necessarily undone by them coming back later."" We recently spoke with three comic book experts, who gave us their thoughts on this phenomenon: . CNN: Why do you think we seem to see more and more of these kinds of stories and changes in comics? Alan Kistler, author/actor/comics historian: The industry's not doing so hot. Books are in danger of cancellation before the second issue even hits the stands. Sales are determined by how many books retailers order rather than how many actually sell. For some reason, we don't advertise comic books outside of comic books themselves. The TV commercial for ""The New 52"" didn't really tell people why they might want to check it out if they'd never read comics before, it just expected you to be excited and already know the gist of what was happening. So these headline-grabbing stories are understandable, because you want to get people talking and you want to enhance curiosity for new consumers. But I think it's a wrong approach. Does spoiling the ending of a comic in the New York Post two days before it's available for purchase really ensure higher sales than if you released that story on the same day or a day after it hits the stands? I doubt it. And it doesn't affect retailer sales because they've already ordered the books at that point. We need to advertise good stories and new-reader-friendly stories. Travis Langley, psychology professor/expert in the comic arts: Declining sales have been scaring publishers for a long time. Not just comic book publishers. Almost 30 years have passed since Egon Spengler told us, ""Print is dead."" These publishers have to do something to keep this medium alive, and we want them to survive. We want them to thrive! Andrea Letamendi, clinical psychologist, scientist, comic convention speaker: I don't necessarily see an increase in incidence with regards to these comic book events in recent years, but perhaps we're more likely to notice them now. These events have been going on for as long as I've been reading comics. And that's been a long time. The comic book industry shouldn't be faulted for having an equivalent to television's ""sweeps week."" When you need a hit, you create an event that will bring in the readers. CNN: Which recent big change or story do you think had the best payoff? Kistler: ""The Death of Captain America."" That story actually had people mourn and move on from the event; there was no rush to bring Steve (Rogers) back. For a few years, we really got to explore what a new Captain America would be and how the world would be different. When Steve did come back, surprise, he needed to process the whole experience rather than rush into his old role. On the flip side, we were told that Batman's ""death"" wasn't real, then saw a former partner questing to prove he wasn't dead, followed by advanced art for a miniseries called the ""Return of Bruce Wayne."" They were good stories, but the marketing approach and early advertising made Dick Grayson seem like a stand-in rather than ""the new Batman."" Letamendi: I strongly believe that The New 52's ""Batgirl"" can be seen as a great example of a major plot shift or re-imagining of a story that required readers to let go of a long-loved character (Oracle) and begin to believe in Batgirl as a new character, one who's recovered from a life-threatening attack. The character essentially presented the determination, resilience and psychological strength that she needed to put the cape back on after a severe injury, just as readers were challenging her ability to represent a strong rebooted character. It's as if we could relate to the weight on her shoulders, because we were a part of that process. Langley: The same-sex weddings. Northstar's wedding (in""Astonishing X-Men"") made sense. These characters, in their fictional worlds, are celebrities. Given how many celebrities made news by marrying their same-sex partners in our world once they legally could, it would have been weird for Marvel's Earth-616 not to have had a same-sex superhero wedding. Kevin Keller's wedding in ""Life with Archie"" is important for the opposite reason, because it's a down-to-earth relationship. Both of those weddings reflect our times and say these characters live in worlds that remain relevant to us. CNN: Do you see even more of these plot twists on the horizon, or the possibility of comic companies trying to top each other? Langley: Competition has value, of course. DC and Marvel are working really hard to find creative new ways to outdo each other, and it's interesting to watch. Marvel's growth in the 1960s challenged DC and inspired them to tell new kinds of stories. It's an exciting time, really. The comic book industry will change, but I'm actually a lot more optimistic about its future now than I was at the start of this millennium. Everything feels so much more alive. Kistler: I see a rising impatience with this kind of headline grabbing and spoilers in the news. People are wondering why comics feel so insecure that they need to advertise the endings of major stories whereas everyone was happy to buy a ""Harry Potter"" and ""Hunger Games"" book without knowing the ending. Letamendi: I think risk-taking comes with a price, and readers of comics are particularly savvy when it comes to storytelling. But competition makes us stronger. These companies--and not just the big ones, but smaller publishers, as well-- want to be known as the best. And that's in the storytelling. So with amazing arcs and events, inevitably come happy readers.","From the deaths of Robin and Peter Parker to major reboots, comics see a lot of change .

"(CNN) -- It's a beautiful spring morning in Florida. I'm standing next to my shiny new road bike on the side of a road, weeping. Passers-by probably assume that I've taken a tumble from said bicycle. They're wrong. So why the tears? It's simple: I feel completely out of control. When I was chosen as a member of the CNN Fit Nation Six-Pack I was thrilled. But almost immediately the fear, doubt and worry set in. In fact, my exact words to Dr. Sanjay Gupta were, ""I'm so excited and a little bit terrified."" I soon settled into my new fitness routine. Each workout was challenging and, for the most part, served to build my confidence. I was running longer without breaks, I was swimming faster and I stopped falling over on the bike. Three months later I boarded a plane to Clermont, Florida, to meet up with my teammates and coaches for a week of intense triathlon training. The schedule was ambitious, leaving me physically exhausted at the end of each day. But Coach April knew we could rise to the occasion, and we did so repeatedly during the week. A few days into training, we tackled our first group bike ride. For me, this was the first time riding in traffic, and I was anxious. I was paired with Denise Castelli, a Fit Nation alumnus, and we fell into place at the back of the pack. When we took a right and headed onto the main road, I freaked. There was no paved shoulder. We were riding on the white line, and I had to trust that drivers wouldn't plow into me. I was focusing on cycling, clipping in and out of my pedals and following Castelli as close to that white line as possible. Then she asked me to pass her so that she would bring up the rear. My brain just shut down. For the first time in my training, the voice telling me, ""You can't do this"" was simply too loud to ignore. I pulled over and wept. Instead of my usual optimism and tenacity, I was consumed by fear and the foregone conclusion of failure. I was terrified of how close the passing cars felt and how fast they seemed to be zipping by me. I didn't trust the drivers to see me, and I didn't trust in my cycling ability to be able to stay out of harm's way. I had pushed past the boundaries of my comfort zone, into a place where I lacked control. That is not a place I'm used to visiting, let alone taking off my coat and staying awhile. There were other challenges for me during the week of training. Don't get me wrong; I had some amazing successes and workouts that just clicked. But there were times that the sentiment, ""What did I get myself into?"" reverberated in my mind. I quickly realized that my fear of losing control was jeopardizing my triathlon goal. Worse, it was robbing me of the joy of my journey. Nope, not going to happen on my watch. So here's what I've learned: . 1. I'm not alone. There is a ton of literature indicating that the fear of losing control is a prevalent issue. The toll that living in such a heightened state of fear, anxiety and stress can have on a person is also well-documented. A quick glance at a list of common phobias, such as fear of flying and enclosed spaces, reveals that a perceived loss of control is the root of most fear. Knowing I'm not alone prevents wasting energy wondering, ""What is wrong with me?"" and instead focuses me on changing my perspective. 2. Desiring control is wanting certainty in an uncertain world. Folks with this fear are usually perfectionists. I need to accept that no one is capable of controlling the future. To break out of the anxiety-filled cycle I have to give up the notion that I have some superhuman level of control. 3. Accepting that I can't completely control the future does not mean that I stop taking responsibility for my actions, decisions or thoughts. I can control my attitude. I can choose to rise to the challenge and genuinely try my best and be proud of that regardless of the outcome. I can make the best choices given the information I have at the time, understanding that nothing is certain. So how do I quit the control cycle? I have to be brave. I have to have courage that I am doing my best with the tools I currently possess and that will be enough. At the beginning of this journey, my friend advised me to ""lean into the fear"" of triathlon training. That sentiment rang true during my time in Florida. I'm proud to say that these hard-won lessons have served to galvanize my resolve. I returned from Florida more determined, more committed, more courageous. My first week back, I squeezed in two extra swim workouts and a yoga class in addition to my regular training load. And I have enjoyed every minute of it! The joy has returned to my journey, and I don't plan to let it get away from me again. I know that when I cross that finish line in Malibu, it won't be the capstone to a perfect race because there is no such thing. But it will be my race. And that will be more than enough.

"Doha, Qatar (CNN) -- Bahiya Al-Hamad is a 19-year-old college student and air-rifle shooter who is about to make history for her country. When she travels to London to take part in the Olympic Games this summer, she will be part of the first group of Qatari women ever to compete at the Olympics. Qatar is one of only three countries -- the others are Saudi Arabia and Brunei -- which have never sent female athletes to an Olympics Games. This year, three women will represent Qatar at London 2012. The others are swimmer Nada Arkaji and sprinter Noor al-Malki. All three women have been given wild cards, but there is still a weight of expectation that is not lost of Al-Hamad. ""It's an accomplishment for every Qatari woman,"" she said. ""I hope I can live up to their expectation."" Training at her shooting club outside Qatar's capital Doha, Al-Hamad added: ""Every athlete's dream is to reach the Olympics."" Competing in London in July and August will be a high point in her life as well as a historic moment for Qatar. ""I will be very excited to go see the atmosphere there and it will sure be one the most special days of my life,"" she said. Al-Hamad has won several regional competitions in the 10-meter rifle shooting category, but missed out on automatically qualifying for London 2012 by half a point. She said she was asleep when she received a call to say she had been awarded a wild card. ""I wanted to scream,"" she said. ""I really loved it. I was optimistic, but never expected to reach the Olympics. ""My dream when it comes to shooting is to be the Olympic or world champion."" See also: Will Saudi women make Olympics debut? One of her shooting club colleagues, Ali Rashid al-Mohannadi, 21, Gulf and Arab champion, and a senior engineering student, said he has nothing but respect for Al-Hamad. ""I think women now are better than us,"" he said. ""I'm very happy, because she's a talented shooter. I'm very happy for her, and I hope she does well in the Olympic Games."" However, not everyone in his socially conservative country feel the same. ""I feel men don't realize the idea yet, but it depends,"" said Al-Hamad. ""Some of them are OK with it, some are not. They say 'you're a girl and you shoot?'"" She added: ""Before, shooting was only for guys but now it became normal for females to an extent. When they saw women emerging in shooting they became a little bit more accepting."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Iraqi artist inspired by George W Bush shoe thrower .

"(CNN) -- Think of Baghdad and for most people what comes to mind is a city of damaged buildings and concrete checkpoints. This is what Caecilia Pieri expected the first time she visited the Iraqi capital just months after the American-led invasion in 2003. Baghdad has a history dating back to ancient Mesopotamia and was later one of Islam's great capitals. But Saddam Hussein's closed regime left the modern city unknown to the outside world. ""I had no idea what to expect, but had heard that the modern city had nothing to offer,"" said Pieri. She was astonished to find a city that she fell in love with. And, surprisingly, what most enthralled her was Baghdad's 20th century architecture, including buildings commissioned by Saddam. ""Despite the dust and the traces of looting, despite the U.S. Army and the disorder, I fell in love with the modern city,"" said Pieri, now head of the Urban Observatory at the French Institute of the Near-East in Beirut. ""I discovered the garden city, the beautiful architecture, the lovely houses with central courtyards and roof terraces, the people who were welcoming to foreigners. ""In the 20th century, Baghdad managed to mix traditional features, methods of building and details of decor with modernity. ""Brickwork has been used in Iraq for 5,000 years, and gives features that you don't see in Syria or Lebanon."" Pieri was so captivated that she wrote a PhD on the 20th century architecture of Baghdad and later a book called ""Baghdad Arts Deco,"" published last year. The architectural boom continued under the dictatorship of Saddam, who ruled from 1979 until he was removed by the invasion in 2003, said Pieri. Also on Inside the Middle East: Saudi Women: Pampered or oppressed? ""Of course there was great architecture built under Saddam Hussein,"" she said. ""He was really fond of architecture, and I could even say that it's a cliche that many dictators were ... see what Mussolini or Hitler commissioned. ""But he was not very consistent in his choices. He happened to commission either great works by great architects, or very kitsch architecture by others."" Great architecture of Saddam's regime includes the Baghdad Mayoralty by Hisham Munir and the Ministry of Finance by Qahtan Madfai, both from the 1980s, according to Pieri. ""Among the kitsch ones are the horrible Monument for the Unknown Soldier, by the Italian Marcello d'Olivo (1982) and the sadly famous Arch of Victory (1983) by Khalid ar-Rahal and Mohammed Ghani,"" she adds. Hisham Ashkouri, a Baghdad-born architect who now works in the United States, said, ""Baghdad is a beautiful city with an incredible history, it's one of the nicest cities anywhere."" Ashkouri, who worked with Hisham Munir, designer of the Baghdad Mayoralty, in Iraq before moving to the United States, added, ""There are some historic homes from the Ottoman era that need to be preserved. We should also open our minds to the 20th and 21st century architecture. There was some incredible work in the 1950s."" As well as being attractive, the buildings were ahead of their time in terms of the environment: Sustainable and suitable for the climate with their thick walls, says Pieri. The city she speaks of is a world away from that seen by most people on television news reports. ""The images on TV focus on events and usually bad events, so they don't have the time to give an insight into the background landscape,"" she said. Since that first visit in 2003, however, Pieri has witnessed a decline that has seen the city divided by concrete walls, blocks and checkpoints. Also on Inside the Middle East: 'Victims of injustice' in post-revolution Egypt speak out . ""Because of the sectarian violence, a decision was taken to divide the city into separate zones. It's frozen the conflict but hasn't brought any fundamental solutions. ""Now when you drive down a main road, you see concrete walls or blocks blocking off the side streets,"" she said. Other problems the city faces include empty buildings being taken over without regulation; once attractive brick buildings being patched up with concrete and metal and courtyard gardens being built on. ""There are no regulations, so many of the central areas are being transformed into second rate commercial buildings. In some residential neighborhoods, many of the buildings were left empty or went to people who couldn't afford to maintain them properly or transformed the gardens into warehouses,"" Pieri said. And then there's the dust. Also on Inside the Middle East: Gaza music students find smart ways around travel ban . ""Saddam Hussein cut down many palm trees, both in the city and in the desert,"" said Pieri. ""Now the dust from the desert is really attacking the buildings. It makes them look more dilapidated now than (they) did during the war."" There are signs of hope for the future though. There have been programs to re-plant palm trees and the Baghdad Mayoralty held a conference, which discussed preserving the city's heritage, according to Pieri. ""There's the beginning of a wider awareness that (Baghdad's) modern heritage is to be preserved,"" she added. ""People are becoming more and more aware that they have something very special in front of their eyes."" After the invasion, Ashkouri's company ARCADD announced plans for a privately funded $13 billion Baghdad Renaissance Plan for a new central business district with easy pedestrian access to the historic center and waterfront. However, the plan remains on hold because of security concerns. ""If it's the last day of my life I will do it, but it would be a terrible mistake to start now because of the violence in the city. The city requires a lot of reconstruction of the sewers, the water, the roads, the electricity systems. That needs to be the first step,"" said Ashkouri. ""There are efforts to rebuild the city which is remarkable in light of the security situation.""","20th century architecture and traditional styles produce an attractive low-rise city .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- In Jordan and Lebanon, women married to foreigners are taking to the streets to fight for their children's citizenship rights. In both countries, women who marry non-nationals are unable to confer nationality on their child or spouse, rendering their families foreigners in the eyes of the law, and denying them rights and access to key public services. In contrast, men from those countries who marry foreigners face no such obstacles. The same situation applied throughout most Arab countries until 2004, when -- following years of campaigning by women's groups -- Egypt changed its laws. In the subsequent years, reforms followed in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Yemen, Libya, the Palestinian territories, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. But in Amman and Beirut, change is slow in coming. Nima Habashna, a 53-year-old Jordanian, has been campaigning for five years for citizenship to be granted to her children. She began her campaign online through a blog called ""My mother is Jordanian and her nationality is my right,"" and last year took her activism to the streets. ""I am a citizen of this country, I pay taxes and it's my right to be treated the same way a Jordanian man is treated,"" she said. ""If we were in any other part of the world where democracy exists, we wouldn't have had to go through this to demand a basic right."" Habashna has six children with a Moroccan man she married in Jordan in 1974. Since he left six years ago, the children have been in a state of limbo. Four have no passports, effectively rendering them stateless. The family must pay for public healthcare and education, freely available to their peers, because the children are not considered Jordanian. Read also: Saudi women slam dunk sports taboo . Habashna's 17-year-old daughter, Rola Habashna, says she is treated differently at school over the nationality issue, even though she was born and bred in the country. ""Even if I don't have a Jordanian passport or citizenship, I consider myself Jordanian,"" she said. ""I was born here, raised here and live my life like any other Jordanian."" An estimated 40,000 Jordanian women and children are affected by the country's citizenship laws, according to government-funded think tank, the King Hussein Foundation. Among them is Salwa Al Arabi, the Jordanian wife of a Pakistani, who joined the protests after her three children repeatedly encountered problems over their nationality. She said it was unfair for the law to discriminate against people for whom they fall in love with. ""What can I do? I found him and I loved him, and it's destiny,"" she said. ""Why can't we be like Egypt or Dubai ... they gave (the children) citizenship."" Habashna agreed: ""People say that the problem is with us marrying non-Jordanians, but it's not that. The problem remains in the laws."" In Lebanon, where the same issue exists, women's rights campaigners marched in the streets earlier this month to call for law reform. Lina Abou Habib, a Beirut-based activist who has campaigned on the issue throughout the region since 2002, estimated 15,000 people in Lebanon were affected by the nationality laws. A year ago, campaigners handed a draft law to Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and in March the issue was addressed by Cabinet for the first time, with a ministerial committee formed. But the committee has yet to meet and Abou Habib believes no action will be forthcoming any time soon. She said the reasons given by politicians to maintain the status quo -- including that doing so would upset Lebanon's fragile demographic balance between the major faith groups -- does not hold water. ""The same politicians are asking for Lebanese nationality to be given to Lebanese immigrants, and we know this will actually benefit one particular confessional group over the others,"" she said. Read also: Tire burning - from symbol of Lebanese conflict to sign of peace . Another common justification is that changing the rules would encourage an influx of Palestinian refugees, and undermine the right of the estimated 400,000 Palestinians already living in Lebanon to return. ""We are talking about equal rights for Lebanese women and men,"" said Abou Habib. ""There is no link between this and undermining the Palestinian cause. The real reason is our political system ... is incredibly patriarchal."" Jordan's government takes a similar position, saying a large influx of refugees from the Palestinian territories, Iraq and Syria makes the issue a political problem. Nadia Hashem, Jordan's women's affairs minister, told CNN she was pursuing the issue. ""I sympathize with them quite a lot. I want to find a solution for these people,"" she said. ""This business of falling in love business is a troublesome area."" But Habashna does not accept the ministry's explanations for her predicament, and says she will continue her ""battle"" until the laws are changed. ""There are a lot of given excuses,"" she said. ""But the real deal is that it's ... discrimination against women.""

"(CNN) -- As bloody unrest has raged around him, artist Oussama Diab has been formulating his own response to Syria's civil war -- through art. Diab, a 35-year-old painter born of Palestinian parents in Damascus and still living in Syria's capital, has a new exhibition of works he has created this year. His exhibition ""In the Name of Freedom"" opened September 17 in Dubai. Diab says he was unable to get a visa to travel to the United Arab Emirates, so he had to remain in Syria. In a telephone interview Diab said his new works ""are inspired by what's going on across the Arab world, politics is in everything."" ""My artwork reflects not only what is happening in Syria but what has happened in all the Arab world. One of the artist's duties is to follow the problems, the worries, the suffering and present it in his work. ""The fact of living inside the situation makes me able to show it better. I can talk about all the suffering that has happened here and also on the other side of the world,"" he added. Diab said he had lost someone close to him in the conflict that has divided Syria since March 2011, but would not give any more details. ""I am always living in worry and I have fears living here,"" he said. ""Without referring to who is doing it, all the bloodshed is not easy to handle, so it affects your mood."" While Diab's work does not directly reference to the civil war in Syria, the themes of war and dreams of a better future are featured in his pictures. One shows a child with a gun superimposed over a barcode. He said it showed how children are the victims of those who deal in weapons for their own ends. Another work shows a woman with her head replaced by balloons, which Diab said represented the nice ideas in her head. Diab has been represented by Ayyam Gallery, which has branches in Damascus, Dubai and Beirut since 2007 when he was one of 10 winners of a competition to find emerging artists. His first solo show was in 2009. Diab's work is described by the gallery as pop art and graffiti-inspired paintings against nondescript backgrounds, giving a symbolic interpretation of current events. Also on Inside the Middle East: Syrian artists fight Assad regime with satire . Among the works is ""Human Being"" showing a banana with nails driven into it. Diab said the banana represents a person suffering from the pain of the nails. Another work shows an altered version of Michaelangelo's ""Pieta"" sculpture in which Jesus Christ wears a keffiyeh, intended to show him as a Palestinian martyr. ""Like Charlie Chaplain, I'm representing a black comedy so it makes you smile and it gives you grief at the same time,"" Diab said of his work. Much of his work reflects his identity as a Palestinian who has never been to his homeland. ""My work is based on the idea of country,"" he said. ""All countries around the world should be sacred. I hate the situation in Syria because Syria should be sacred as well. I don't want the country to be ruined. ""Because I live without a country, it makes me feel closer to people who are suffering here. I feel their suffering and it affects me too. It makes me closer to understanding their pain."" Diab's said he feels his identity split between his Palestinian heritage and his parents' adopted country. ""I never had the chance to live in Palestine, so I feel like the country is an illusion,"" he said. ""My parents didn't come to a strange country, but one where they could speak the same language. The idea of country is sacred to me. Syria is my second country, but I would love to be in my other country."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Images of Tahrir: Egypt's revolutionary art . Diab visited Dubai for the opening of the Ayyam Gallery a few years ago, but said he has not been able to get a visa to visit since. Sally Othman, gallery manager of Ayyam Damascus, said artists in the city were continuing to work during the unrest, but there are fewer exhibitions. ""The gallery is running as normal because we have our artists based here, but as far as exhibitions, it's hard these days because people are not going out,"" she said. ""We had two workshops with four actors working live in the gallery before Ramadan and we are going to do something similar soon."" ""In the Name of Freedom"" runs at Ayyam Gallery, DIFC, Dubai, until October 30.

"(CNN) -- For centuries, Bedouins of the Middle East survived a nomadic lifestyle in unforgiving deserts by relying on animals. From camels to desert falcons, animals provided food, transportation, and even companionship in the harsh, isolated land. Today, sports utility vehicles have largely replaced the hump-backed 'ships of the desert' throughout the Middle East. But animals still play a vital role in daily life and the culture of the region. Beirut's Rescued Animals . We visit an animal shelter in Beirut that has taken up the often overlooked cause of animal abuse and rescue. Encouraging adoption and humane treatment of animals, BETA also helps humans -- the animals are part of a therapy program to help children with special needs. Rima Maktabi takes us there. Lion Whisperer . Lions, tigers, cheetahs and other exotic and endangered animals are prized pets for many Emiratis for whom it is the ultimate status symbol. When the cubs grow into adulthood and develop violent traits, many are often abandoned and it falls to private individuals and parks to take the animals in and rehabilitate. Schams Elwazer meets the Lion Whisperer Ras Al Khaima as he plays with a rescued lion and visit a woman in Dubai whose home shelters almost 300 animals from tortoises to alpacas to parrots. Pet Hotel . The United Arab Emirates is known for its luxurious resorts and seven-star hotels -- now the trend has extended to our four-legged companions. A seven-star hotel recently opened in Abu Dhabi caters to cats and dogs with suites that even include plasma screens. Camelicious . At a trendy cafÃ© near the world's tallest building, customers sip on camel milk lattes. In the high-end malls of Dubai, camel milk chocolate is a luxury brand. We look into the trend of a modern take on camel products, used by the Bedouins for centuries for transportation, milk and meat. From camel burgers to a high-tech lab processing camel milk for commercial sale in supermarkets, Rima Maktabi looks at how the dromedary is making a modern comeback. Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital . Falcons have been prized for centuries in the Bedouin culture for sport and companionship. More than just pets, they have their own passports, travel in cabins on airlines, and in Abu Dhabi have their own five-star hospital. We look into the passion behind falconry and witness the animals' care from pedicures to surgery. Cairo's Pigeon Trainers . We take to the rooftops of Cairo where flocks of pigeons weave through the skies above the urban jungle of the Egyptian capital. As Ian Lee finds out, the love for breeding and training homing pigeons transcends class boundaries and political affiliations as over two million pigeon owners escape the streets to continue an ancient tradition in the skies.

""They killed him to silence his freedom of speech,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Six-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt was beaten into second place by Justin Gatlin in the 100 meters at the Diamond League's Rome meeting. The Jamaican, who won three sprint gold medals at the London Games, lost out to his American rival who clocked a time of 9.94 seconds. Bolt finished 0.01 secs behind. Bolt was making his first appearance in the competition this season after a hamstring injury kept him out of previous events in Qatar and Oregon. ""I got the perfect start that I wanted, then about five steps in I stumbled a little bit and that kind of threw my game off,"" Bolt told the BBC. ""My legs didn't feel like my legs coming into the straight. It's one of those things. I need to do more strength work, I guess. At least I got under 10 seconds. ""I think I just need time to get it back together, this season for some reason it goes right back to ground zero. I think the fact I got a good start threw me off, then I was all over the place and at the end it just wasn't me."" Bolt enshrined his legacy as a sprint great when he successfully defended his 100m, 200m titles at the 2012 Olympics, as well as the 4x100m relay with his Jamaican team. He recently spoke of his desire to do the same at the Rio Games in 2016, which he predicted will be his last appearance at the event. Gatlin, who served a four-year ban after testing positive for banned substances, was satisfied to beat the world record holder. ""It feels good,"" he told the BBC. ""I put together my race strategy, and I'm not really worried about who is in the race. ""Usain Bolt is a great competitor and great champion so to come out here and have a victory it just stands that I'm having a good season. ""I just want to be confident and dominant when I run no matter what the time is. It's not about 9.6 or 9.7 at this point in time it's about putting on a great show for the fans.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- The young seamstress who survived 17 days in the rubble of a collapsed factory building got a new job Thursday -- a five-star hotel said it had hired her as its ""public area ambassador.""

"(CNN) -- It has taken almost three months and more than 100 men embarking on a life-threatening hunger strike for President Obama to remind himself and the nation why the prison at Guantanamo Bay needs to be closed. Self-starvation is excruciating, but as one of our clients expressed, this is the only way the men at Guantanamo have left to tell the world what it means to be unjustly detained without charge or trial for more than 11 years with no end in sight. The starvation protest, which began in February, has created headlines around the world. Of the 100 men, 23 are being force fed to keep them alive. As you read this, it's likely that some of the men are being dragged from their cells, strapped to restraint chairs, and a rubber tube inserted up their nose and into their stomachs to pump in liquid dietary supplement. One of the men described the traumatic experience to his attorney as having a razor blade go down through your nose and into your throat. Last week, 40 additional military medical personnel were sent to Guantanamo to assist with the force-feedings, a practice that the American Medical Association condemned as a violation of ""core ethical values of the medical profession"" and the United Nations condemned as torture and a breach of international law. Force-feedings at Guantanamo are nothing new, and much like indefinite detention, the practice has come to define the prison. In 2005, when the first mass hunger strike at the prison took place, the Bush administration also responded by having medical personnel force-feed the men. Back then the men were fighting for due process and access to attorneys; eight years later and with more than half the prison population cleared for release by the Obama administration itself, the men are asking for an end to their indefinite detention. As President Obama said last week, the prison is ""not necessary to keep America safe. It's expensive, it's inefficient, it hurts us in terms of international standing, it lessens cooperation with our allies in counterterrorism efforts."" It is also illegal and inhumane, as the United Nations' top independent human rights experts and the international human rights body with jurisdiction over the United States, the OAS's Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, reminded the president. I would like to believe that if the president could see what lawyers at my organization have witnessed during visits with our clients in the last few weeks, he would act without delay to make good on the promise he made to close Guantanamo Bay four years ago. The toll that starvation and the violence of force-feedings have taken on the men is painful to see. They have lost 30 to 40 pounds, they look skeletal, and many are losing consciousness and coughing up blood. Last we heard, one of our clients weighed 90 pounds. I'd like to believe that if President Obama knew a man like Djamel Ameziane, he would understand that closing the prison is not a matter of political expediency but life or death. Djamel has been cleared for release, the government has said there are no ""military rationales"" for detaining him further, and other countries have expressed an interest in resettling him because he fears persecution in his home country of Algeria. Yet he continues to languish in a cell years later. What does that do to a man's spirit? The president said he continues to believe ""we've got to close Guantanamo."" But believing is not enough. Believing in the president and having their hopes for justice raised and dashed so many times since the order to close Guantanamo was first signed in 2009 is what drove the men at Guantanamo to put their lives on the line with this hunger strike. Guantanamo is back in the news in a serious way for the first time in years, and it is the men themselves who have succeeded in putting it there, using the only peaceful means they have available to them to demand their lives back. The president has more staff members force-feeding men whom his own administration cleared for release than he has working to transfer them out. It should not take the inevitable deaths that will follow from this crisis for the president to act. He must stop pretending Congress is preventing him from doing anything. Right now he has the authority that Congress provided under the National Defense Authorization Act to start transferring the men who have been cleared using a national security waiver. He also has the power to lift his self-imposed moratorium on transfers to Yemen. Collective punishment based on nationality is as illegal as indefinite detention. The president said the right things last week. He has said the right things before. All it takes now is the humanity and the will to act and end the horror that is Guantanamo prison. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Vincent Warren.","Vince Warren: It took 100 men on a hunger strike for Obama to remember he must close Gitmo .
Warren: Starving is the only way inmates can protest being held 11 years with no charges .
Obama sent more staff to force feed hunger strikers, which is considered torture, he says .

"(CNN) -- To the devout, the concept of becoming ""Muslim for a month"" -- or any other religion, for that matter -- could verge on the sacrilegious. ""It's a provocative title, 'Muslim for a Month,' so we were bracing ourselves for (criticism),"" said Ben Bowler, who runs cultural exchange programs with that name. The tours take non-Muslims from around the world into Turkish mosques and homes for a first-hand experience of Islam. ""There has been a little of that -- 'Being a Muslim is for life, not just a month,"" he added. But overwhelmingly, he said, the response from Muslims has been positive because the tours help to dispel negative stereotypes about the religion and leave participants with an enriched spiritual perspective. ""People are very visibly moved,"" Bowler said. ""There's lots of tears. It's a rich, multi-layered experience and people are coming out with changed ideas and changed perceptions -- they are more aware of the positive side of the religion than before."" Muslim for a Month, run by Bowler's NGO World Weavers, is part of a new breed of cultural immersion tourism being dubbed ""pray-cations."" It promises travelers a rich, meaningful experience, by exposing them to religious beliefs and practices ""in a country where spirituality is still very much alive,"" he said. Bowler, a Thailand-based Australian, has run half a dozen of the tours in recent years, during which participants are taught the basics of Islamic practice, study Islamic history and calligraphy, pray in mosques and live and eat with Muslim families. The itinerary also includes a day of fasting. During the 10-day or 21-day tours (the ""month"" in the tour name is slightly misleading, organizers admit), tour members stay in a 400-year-old Sufi lodge in Istanbul's Eyup district, visit the ancient city of Konya to visit the tomb of Sufi mystic Rumi, and admire the ecstatic services of the whirling dervishes who follow his teachings. See also: My Faith: How Hajj gave us a child . Those teachings set the tone for the course, said Bowler. Rumi, who lived in 13th century, was ""somebody who, during a time of ethnic tensions, was able to hit a very high note of love and tolerance and acceptance that we want to hold up as relevant today,"" he added. Tina Reisman-Boukes, a 56-year-old Dutch social worker and convert to Judaism, took part in one of the tours on the recommendation of her son. He had been on one himself, and given her a book on Rumi, as he believed it would resonate with her. She said the course gave her a deeper understanding, both of Islam, ""as a systematic way to get closer to God,"" and of herself. The rituals of Islam, she said, helped her in her quest to resolve the ""inner conflict between individuality and community."" It also emphasized the connections between all people -- whatever their faith. ""Rumi loved people, not because of what they did or showed, but because he saw the little flame in their heart that waits to be illuminated,"" she said. ""I was born in Holland, baptized Christian and converted to Judaism ... If I had been born in Turkey, I might have been Muslim. If I had been born in Thailand, I might have been Buddhist. Does it matter?"" Reisman-Boukes's experience reflected the aims of the course, which were twofold, said Bowler: to correct the current ""low PR of Islam itself, and religion in general."" He hopes the tours will promote ""global understanding"" by establishing direct contact between outsiders and the Muslim world. ""So many of our ideas are formed through second-hand information,"" he said. ""We're wanting this to be an example of first-hand experience, which makes people's preconceptions fall away."" Bowler also wishes for the tours to encourage participants in ""the search for spirituality"" in an increasingly secular world. ""I'm from Australia, my wife is Dutch, so we're both from very secular backgrounds, and it feels like we might be missing out on something,"" he said. ""It's (a) living, breathing religious experience just being on the tour. We hope they go away not just with a broader understanding of Islam, but with a broader personal spiritual perspective as well."" No participants had converted to Islam, he said, although that was not something the tours particularly sought to encourage. He said that typically, the most challenging aspect of Islamic life for tourists was the segregation between the genders, particularly given that some tours were 70% women.

The group's Facebook page has been targeted with derogatory anti-Muslim comments by the far-right British National Party, while some travel agents have been reluctant to promote the tours due to unease about Islam, said Bowler. Meanwhile, some Muslims have expressed discomfort with their all-encompassing faith being treated as something that can be dipped into as a touristic experience. But Bowler, who has also run ""Monk for a Month"" tours with Thai Buddhists, and is launching an ""Interfaith Express"" tour in Turkey focusing on the three Abrahamic faiths, believes there is nothing wrong with the tour's approach to religion. ""We might be the first generation that gets to experience a variety of religions,"" he said. ""I grew up in an Irish Catholic family where my dad was Catholic because his dad was Catholic and that was as much thought that went into it. ""These days we're blessed to be able to experience Buddhism or Islam or Christianity or whatever it might be and to take the values and the meanings we find and apply them to life.

"(CNN) -- Following a volatile week in Myanmar that has seen a surge in deadly sectarian violence, a group of Islamic organizations in the country announced that it had canceled all celebrations for Eid al-Adha, the four-day religious holiday observed by many Muslims. No reason was given in the announcement from the All Myanmar Islam Association, a collaboration of five major Islamic organizations there. But locals are seeing it as a precautionary measure after the violence in recent days. Clashes between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims have flared this week, killing dozens of people and burning thousands of homes to the ground in the western state of Rakhine. There has been tension between the two ethnic groups since May, when violence began after three Muslim men were arrested on suspicion of raping and killing a Buddhist woman. New satellite imagery obtained by Human Rights Watch shows what it said was extensive destruction of buildings in a predominantly Rohingya area of the coastal town of Kyauk Pyu. The swath of arson, the group said, stretched over 35 acres and included houseboats and floating barges. The government in Myanmar ""urgently needs to provide security for the Rohingya ... who are under vicious attack,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. ""Unless the authorities also start addressing the root causes of the violence, it is only likely to get worse."" The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority who say they have been persecuted by the Myanmar military during its decades of authoritarian rule. Myanmar doesn't recognize them as citizens. Q&A: What's behind the sectarian violence in Myanmar? Unrest between the Rohingya and majority Buddhists has tested President Thein Sein's administration, which is trying to seek reconciliation with Myanmar's different ethnic groups and move the country toward more democratic governance. The government has sent extra security into the troubled region and declared a state of emergency. The president's office warned Thursday that ""manipulators"" behind the violence can expect to be found and prosecuted. Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, speaking in Parliament on Friday, called for a greater security presence and urged authorities to investigate suspected human rights offenses.

"(CNN) -- A Swedish performer emerged victorious in the Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday, beating out competition from 25 other nations. Singer Loreen, 28, won for ""Euphoria,"" an upbeat dance-style song. Dressed in dark colors, she sang in shadows, playing off flashing lights, wind and snow. ""I want to say that I love you so much. Thank you for believing in me,"" she said soon after winning, addressing her fans. ""This is not just mine. This is ours."" The annual event attracts an estimated global audience of 125 million and is loved for its combination of over-the-top costumes, kitsch pop songs, sometimes dubious talent and international rivalries. Among the more unusual contenders this year was Buranovskiye Babushki, a group of self-described grannies from Russia. Dressed in flowing skirts and sensible shoes, they performed a choreographed baking routine. Russia finished second behind Sweden. Serbia won third with a performance by Zeljko Joksimovic. Donny Montell, Lithuania's entry, sang ""Love is Blind,"" ripping off a blindfold as he broke into dance. Yet for all its entertainment value, talk in the run-up to this year's contest was dominated by where it was being held -- Azerbaijan -- as its performers. The host nation generally uses the event to promote itself to tourists and foreign investors. But this year, human rights activists have questioned whether Azerbaijan, formerly part of the Soviet Union, should have been allowed to host the contest given what they describe as its poor record on freedom of expression. Human Rights Watch last month urged the contest's organizers and other nations to put pressure on Azerbaijan's government to prevent ""violence against journalists, social media activists, and human rights defenders; refrain from using politically-motivated criminal charges against journalists and others; release people imprisoned on politically-motivated charges; and allow peaceful assemblies."" At present, Azerbaijan ""remains hostile towards free media and other forms of free expression,"" the group said. ""Police have violently dispersed protests, beating and arresting peaceful demonstrators and organizers."" Azerbaijan ranks 162 out of 179 countries in the latest Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. Rights advocacy group Amnesty International says 12 people are currently in prison in Azerbaijan because of their connection to anti-government protests held last year. Eleven of the prisoners began a hunger strike on 15 May that they intended to maintain until the end of the Eurovision Song Contest, Amnesty said. It was not immediately what has or will happen, with the talent show now complete. Azerbaijan's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Fakhraddin Gurbanov, told CNN that human rights are guaranteed by his country's constitution, but admitted there are problems. ""We are only 10 years old, and we are building a democratic society,"" he said prior to the event, which he promised would showcase his country's culture and hospitality. ""It's a long way to go. It's not easy, it's very challenging."" Emin Milli, a former political prisoner in Azerbaijan now studying in London, accused the government of detaining a few individuals on politically-motivated grounds in order to scare other people. He told CNN he'd hoped performers on the live show would comment on the human rights situation in Azerbaijan -- a statement that would be seen by tens of millions of people -- but that didn't happen. Despite the ""Euro-"" prefix, contestants can come from any member country of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) that includes numerous non-European nations, some, like Azerbaijan, from central Asia. The EBU is made up of broadcasters, not governments, and each year it is up to the participating broadcaster from each country to submit one act chosen through their own selection process. With Loreen's victory Saturday, Sweden joins France, the United Kingdom and Luxembourg as countries that have recorded five wins. They all trail Ireland, whose contestants have walked away with the top prize seven times, including a run of three consecutive victories in 1992, 1993 and 1994. The voting that led to Loreen's win began after all the finalists performed. Countries were awarded a set of points from one to eight, then 10 and finally 12 for their favorite songs. Voters could not select performers from their own countries, and the scores were announced in both English and French. Television viewers cast votes in their respective countries through telephone hotlines, which count toward the final vote. Many perceive the voting to be tactical, with neighbors or members of regional blocs, such as the former Soviet nations, appearing to base their scoring on geopolitical alliances rather than artistic merit. Most winning acts or artists go on to sink without trace. Among the few notable exceptions are ABBA, who won in 1974 with ""Waterloo,"" and Celine Dion, who was imported from Quebec to represent Switzerland in the 1988 contest.

"(CNN) -- The son of the-highest ranking CIA officer ever to be sentenced for espionage was sentenced Tuesday to probation and community service for continuing his jailed father's espionage activities, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Portland, Oregon. Nathan Nicholson pleaded guilty last year to helping his father -- Harold  James ""Jim"" Nicholson -- restart his spying career while the father was serving a  23-year-prison sentence. He was sentenced to serve five years on probation and complete 100 hours of community service, Gerri Badden, a spokeswoman for the US attorney in Portland. The elder Nicholson pleaded guilty in 1997 to spying for Russia, making him the  highest-ranking CIA officer imprisoned for espionage. Last  month he pleaded guilty to spying for the Russians once again by using  his son as an intermediary. He faces sentencing in that case in January, 2010. According to court documents, Nathan Nicholson, 26, cooperated with  prosecutors in their case against his father after FBI agents confronted him  about frequent international travel, in which they suspected Nathan Nicholson of  meeting with Russian intelligence agents. During the FBI questioning, Nicholson, who is a former U.S. Army  paratrooper admitted to authorities that he had not gone overseas to  visit ""a battle buddy"" as he had claimed previously. FBI agents then  informed Nicholson that lying to them was a federal crime and offered  him a chance to change his story, according to one agent's testimony. At that point, FBI Special Agent John Cooney  testified, Nicholson became more ""forthcoming"" about his meetings with Russians. Nathan Nicholson told the agents that at  his father's behest, he made trips to  California, Mexico, Peru and Cyprus, where he met with Russian  government representatives who gave him payments totaling over $35,000  in cash. During Nathan Nicholson¹s prison visits to his  father, according to court records, ""Harold Nicholson spent a significant  amount of time advising defendant on how to conduct himself in a  clandestine manner as he traveled to and from various international  meeting locations.  Harold Nicholson tried to impart his CIA training to  defendant."" Prosecutors alleged that the Russians paid the elder Nicholson back pay for his prior espionage activities and for information on how he was caught. ""The Russian Federation was specifically  interested in how Harold Nicholson got caught by the FBI,"" according to a government sentencing memo filed with the court.  It added that the information concerned ""who interrogated him  after his arrest and the timing of his transfers as a CIA Officer prior  to his arrest."" According to court records, the elder Nicholson and his son put the plot  into motion after Nathan Nicholson complained to his father that the  family was in a precarious financial situation. The sentencing memo said that Nathan  Nicholson provided crucial help in the prosecution of his father. The elder Nicholson pleaded guilty on the day that his trial was set to have begun  last month and who now faces an additional 20 years in prison. In an  October, 2010, psychological report entered into the court record by  prosecutors, Nathan Nicholson took aim at his ex-spy father. ""I wasn¹t  aware of his selfish side,"" Nathan Nicholson said, according to the  records. ""I allowed myself to be blind-sided.  I was like a lobster in a  pot, heated slowly until it was too late.""","The father is the highest-ranking CIA officer ever sentenced for espionage .

"Washington (CNN) -- Swimmers, if you want to know how filthy that lake or stream is before you jump in, there's now an app for that. The Environmental Protection Agency launched its My Waterway app on Thursday, available through the agency's website. By identifying the user's GPS location, the software allows swimmers and fishers to check the water quality in thousands of lakes, rivers and streams in the United States from their computer or smartphone. A list of waterways within five miles of the user's search location is returned and includes details about the water condition. Users can also enter a physical address to get results. CNN checked the app from its Washington offices near the U.S. Capitol. The My Waterway app identified 19 waterways within five miles of the nation's capital, all either listed as polluted or condition unknown. One of those waterways near the capital, the Anacostia River, has long been plagued by pollution so bad the Natural Resources Defense Council deemed it a ""poster child for America's tragically neglected, abused urban waterways."" The app's results showed the river had low oxygen, murky water, pesticides, toxic chemicals and trash, among other warnings about the river's condition.

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VICE) -- On the morning of May 24 of this year, two gunmen ambushed and murdered Amazon activist José ""Zé"" Cláudio Ribeiro da Silva and his wife, Maria do Espírito Santo da Silva in the Brazilian state of Pará. The couple's involvement in environmentalism began with the creation of the Alta Piranheira Beach settlement in 1997. This settlement, where fruit gathering is the only form of production permitted, is part of a program of agrarian reform designated for poor families who depend on the land for survival. Elected out of the almost 200 poor families who live in the area, they led the fight to protect the forest. They became activists through practice, defending their property from illegal loggers the same way your dad would against drivers who clip his lawn -- by going out on the curb and yelling at them. ""The problems we have arrived with the creation of the settlement project. I didn't belong to any social movement. I lived in my own little corner,"" Zé Cláudio explained. ""Zé Ribamar, a neighbor of mine, invited me to participate in the meetings, and I found out I was already an environmentalist without even knowing it."" Outside Brazil, the fight for the Amazon is seen largely as an ecological matter, but here it's a social issue. This is a country where 1 percent of the population owns more than half the land, a sickening proportion of it composed of large, completely unused tracts of farmland called latifundios. The former rain forest around Zé Cláudio and Maria's settlement is a prime example of such irresponsible land use. The majority of deforested land in the Amazon is used for cattle ranching. As ranchers and their supporters will point out, the beef industry is a major part of Brazil's economy and an increasingly important source of American meat. The problem is that while clear-cutting sections of rain forest and burning out all the underbrush makes great soil for pastureland, it only does so for about three years. After that, the soil's fertility plunges, ""invasive"" jungle plants like the babaçu tree begin to grow again, and ranchers are forced to find another plot of rain forest to slash and burn for their cows. See the rest of Toxic: Amazon at VICE.COM . Throughout the years, six farmers who owned illegal titles were forced out by Zé Cláudio and Maria's settlement. During this same time, the federal government, via the Institute of Colonization and Agricultural Reform, had promised to provide some form of basic infrastructure, but public support never materialized. With no alternatives, more and more of the settlers began to give up, and Zé Cláudio and Maria became increasingly isolated. The morning of their deaths, Zé Cláudio and Maria had been driving to Marabá, the biggest and most important city in Pará's interior. Once well within the rain forest, the city as well as its surrounding area now looks like Texas and is the capital of the state's cattle industry. It is also one of the most violent places in the world. Locals like to call it Marabala, which translates roughly to Mara-bullets. The murder rate is a horrifying 125 per 100,000 people, second only to nearby Itupiranga, with 160.6. By point of comparison, the rate in New York City is 5. The grisly death of Zé Cláudio and Maria -- shot point-blank with a hunting rifle, and Zé Cláudio's ear cut off to prove the hit took place -- harkened back to other violent moments in the history of the Amazon, such as the assassinations of Father Josimo Tavares in 1986, Chico Mendes in 1988 and Sister Dorothy Stang in 2005. In the past 15 years, 212 community leaders have been murdered just in the state of Pará. ""I don't blame the farmer. He doesn't know better. The businessman is to blame. The richer he is, the more destructive power he possesses,"" Maria said before her death. ""The majority of farmers are just dupes of the rich.""","Married environmental activists shot to death outside their home in Amazon in May .

"(CNN) -- In the ancient Syrian city of Homs, locals used to enjoy a vibrant cafÃ© culture and relatively easy living. The city was a Syrian success, a center for agriculture, oil and trade; a home to Shia, Sunni and Alawite Muslims as well as a small Christian community among its one million people. The road through Homs connects Syria's largest city, Aleppo, in the north, to the capital, Damascus, in the south, and it's from there that President Bashar al-Assad's military has come. Those days are now distant memories as the city became the heart of an anti-government uprising and this week became the focal point of the regime's brutal clampdown. Rebels and civilians holed up in the besieged city are dying under a relentless barrage of rocket fire. The Syrian military has surrounded it with tanks and heavy weapons, and snipers are positioned on roofs, picking off anyone who dares to walk the streets, opposition activists say. They fear that now, after a brutal week-long assault, the army could be about to move in to wipe out the resistance. No one knows for sure how many people are living under the barrage. They cower in their homes as shells explode, destroying buildings and killing indiscriminately. The death toll is rising daily as world leaders talk, but with powerhouses China and Russia so far siding with Syria, there has been little more than rhetorical support. One man, who has got the message from Homs out to the wider world via YouTube and CNN, is 'Danny' -- an assumed name to protect his identity. Pain etched across his young face, Danny said: ""They are going to kill us all and if you don't help us, they'll kill millions and no one will find out about it. Please, someone help us."" After the failure last week by the U.N. Security Council to agree on a resolution condemning the violence, Homs has seen some of the fiercest attacks yet by Assad's army. One resident, who called himself Aslan said Wednesday: ""There is helicopter now that attack Baba Amr area. ""Thirty minute ago, two helicopters. Too much shooting before. And explosions in some homes there. ""In my room, beside with my friend, because my family [left the area, they are too scared] No electricity. No [internet] network. No anything. We have Thuraya [a hand-held satellite phone]. Also Lebanese [cell phone] network. ""No medicine, need oxygen now [for hospitals]."" At a hospital in Baba Amr on Thursday the dead and the injured were arriving around the clock. Ali, a doctor, said: ""All I have is gauze, bandages, old stitches and (a) few antiseptic wipes."" He has no surgical equipment to help the wounded. As he spoke to CNN by telephone there were seven thundering explosions. He believed Syrian jets were firing on the city but he did not want to look out the window to check in case it cost him his life. ""There is now way to flee Baba Amr because all surrounding suburbs are also under attack and anything that moves is shot at,"" Hazoury says. He reckons the assault has damaged 60 percent of homes in Baba Amr. Families who did try to escape were captured by government forces and killed, said an opposition spokesman, who CNN is calling Abu Rami. Videos purporting to show the violence in Homs appear to support the accounts of witnesses, although it is not possible to independently confirm their authenticity. In one scene, a row of buildings painted in pink and blue pastels survived intact but on the other side of the street, bodies were pulled from the rubble of an attack and loaded onto flatbed trucks. On another street a rocket tore a V-shape through a street wall as smoke filled the air. Other video contains images of the wounded -- sometimes bleeding, sometimes bandaged -- and schools and homes that have been bombed. On Wednesday, Danny spoke via Skype. Wearing headphones and locked in a white-walled room, he showed off a mortar that had landed nearby: ""We are human beings, we're like animals being killed here. ... I am scared a rocket might land in this room and kill me. ""Women and children have got used to seeing blood and body parts in the street. They are really afraid. ""The Syrian army is surrounding Babr Ama with army troops and tanks and anti-aircraft. They have been bombarding us with rockets. ""There are snipers all around these buildings. Anyone who tries to come up the street will get shot. We always walk along the wall so the sniper does not see us."" In video dispatches posted on YouTube, Danny showed a military vehicle he said was captured by rebel fighters, civilians living in cramped rooms, bodies carpeting floors -- and his own growing desperation. Survivors are trapped, dodging snipers and heavy arms fire from tanks surrounding the city, and waiting to see if the army advances. The rebel Free Syrian Army -- containing soldiers who defected from Assad's military to join the rebels -- is unable to fight back because government forces are striking from outside the city beyond the range of their small arms, Abu Rami said. ""Who's going to resist? You can't see anything, so there is not any armed resistance in these areas,"" he said. Parts of the city are without power. Sometimes the security forces shut down electricity and telecommunications networks ahead of early morning raids to root out opposition members. ""If you're in a place where they cut off the power or the phones, you know you're in trouble,"" Abu Rami said. There is a shortage of everything from children's milk formula to oil for heating, and he says security forces are preventing medical aid from reaching dying citizens. Standing in a shelled street, Danny yells into his camera: ""Where's the U.N.?, where's the humanity, where is America?""

"(EW.com) -- Here's what the Memorial Day weekend taught us: America really likes the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise, but America loves movies. The four-day holiday racked up $314 million in receipts, the largest-ever Memorial Day weekend at the box office. As for ""Fast 6,"" it's hard to talk about the successful opening without resorting to cliché. Despite hitting theaters in a crowded May marketplace, the Universal film earned an estimated $120,019,000, the fourth-highest Memorial Day opening in history, for a per-theater average of $33,400. That's the second-biggest opening this year, behind Iron Man 3, and a sizable leap from the trajectory of the previous two Fasts (and most predictions). The franchise's appeal seems to be growing in reverse (we wrote a cover story on it!), getting bigger with each film. The newest installment earned an ""A"" CinemaScore (""A+"" from audiences under 25) with an almost even split between men and women (51/49 percent). Conventionally, that would indicate that ""Fast 6"" will hold up better than the typical tent pole — however, Fast Five also earned an ""A"" and good reviews while still dropping more than 60 percent in its second weekend. That said, it still wouldn't affect the success of the latest film so far: Fast & Furious 6 has grossed $317 million globally against a $160 million budget. And in case you haven't heard: ""Fast 7"" is coming soon. Speaking of big-budget, male-skewing films: ""The Hangover Part III"" earned an estimated $51,215,000 over the four-day weekend, for a per-theater average of $14,406, and $63 million since Thursday. That's hardly nothing — especially for a hard-R comedy, which has a notoriously rocky record at the box office. But the $100 million film's ""B"" CinemaScore and middling reviews indicate that word-of-mouth won't help subsequent weekend grosses. From here, it's hard to see Part III matching the $250+ million grosses of the first two films, though strong foreign sales should help Warner Bros. overcome the sting. The weekend's third wide release, ""Epic,"" topped expectations with an estimated $42,600,000 for the four-day and a per-theater average of $10,974. Tracking suggested an opening in the mid-30s, but the Blue Sky film had a plum release spot at the start of the tent pole season without any major family-friendly competition. Good reviews and an ""A"" CinemaScore suggest real legs, which means ""Epic"" could finish with more than $150 million domestically on a $93 million budget. Last week's ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" earned an estimated $44 million for the long weekend, which softens its second week drop to 33 percent and an overall domestic gross of $155.8 million. The well-reviewed but maligned sequel may not top the previous film's gross of $257.7 million, but it should easily top $200 million. ""Iron Man 3"" earned an estimated $24,351,000, lifting its total domestic gross to $372.4 million. With a new director and a surge of post-""Avengers"" buzz, the third ""Iron Man"" has already beaten the previous two installments and is on track for a domestic finish above $400 million. In limited release, Richard Linklater's critically-acclaimed romantic drama ""Before Midnight"" opened with a per-theater average of $64,400 at five theaters. 1. Fast & Furious 6 — $120 million . 2. The Hangover Part III — $51.2 million . 3. Star Trek Into Darkness — $47 million . 4. Epic — $42.6 million . 5. Iron Man 3 — $24.4 million .

"(CNN) -- Two astronauts conducted a spacewalk Saturday to address an ammonia leak in the International Space Station's cooling system, a mission that ended with NASA optimistic the potentially major problem had been fixed. In addition to inspecting the site of the leak, NASA astronauts Chris Cassidy and Tom Marshburn removed and replaced a 260-pound pump controller box, NASA explained. Afterward, Cassidy and Marshburn couldn't detect any sign of a leak -- which might have been manifest, in this case, as ammonia snow flakes -- when space agency officials back on Earth ran the new pump. Still, NASA noted that the area needs to be monitored long-term to prove that the problem has been fixed. ""No leaks!"" tweeted Chris Hadfield of Canada, the space station's commander, who choreographed the spacewalk. ""We're bringing Tom & Chris back inside. ... This is an amazing place & time."" The entire spacewalk took 5 hours and 30 minutes -- an hour less than expected. First detected early Thursday morning, the leak was causing ammonia to enter space at a rate of 5 pounds per day, Mike Suffredini, NASA's space station program manager, told reporters Friday. Ammonia is used to cool the solar arrays that provide electricity to station systems. The discovery spurred teams at NASA, over a busy 24-hour stretch, to go into ""a full-court press to understand what the failure is"" and how to address it, NASA flight director Norm Knight said Friday. That set the stage for the spacewalk involving three of the space station's six-man crew. The leak was in a cooling loop in a solar array that has leaked before, and astronauts tried to fix it in November. It's unclear whether the leak detected this week was the same one or a new issue. The ammonia coolant for the power channel, one of eight used to supply electricity to the station, would likely have run out by late Friday morning had it not been shut down, NASA said. ""It is a serious situation, but between crew and experts on the ground, it appears to have been stabilized,"" Hadfield tweeted Thursday. Still, the space station's crew -- which also includes three Russian cosmonauts -- were never in danger because of it, NASA said. Moreover, the agency has said the rest of the orbiter was otherwise operating normally. Both Marshburn and Hadfield are scheduled to leave the space station at 7:08 p.m. ET Monday with Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko, and NASA said Friday that the spacewalk wouldn't affect those plans. Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Alexander Misurkin and Pavel Vinogradov will stay behind. They'll eventually be joined by NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg, Russian cosmonaut Fiyodor Yurchikhin and European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano, who are due to launch aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft on May 28. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","2 astronauts did a spacewalk to address ammonia leaking from the International Space Station .

"(CNN) -- As Michael Ballack finally calls time on his 17-year professional career, German football can bask in the knowledge they boast the best two teams in Europe. But while the Champions League final between eventual winners Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund showcased all that is good about German football, the 36-year-old has told CNN the domestic game may suffer as a result. As well as the continent's most glittering club prize, Bayern won the German Cup and the Bundesliga by an incredible 25 points. Dortmund, who won the championship in the previous two seasons, were their nearest challengers, and the pair have accounted for five of the last six titles. Ballack told CNN World Sport that duopoly could be bad news for the Bundesliga, if Germany's top league starts to resemble Spain, where Barcelona and Real Madrid reign supreme. ""In Germany we have a situation now where Dortmund and Bayern are far, far more away from the other teams, and that's what we don't want to see in the Bundesliga,"" said Ballack, who has 98 Germany caps to his name. ""We have a little bit of a similar situation in Spain with Barca and Madrid, and in the (English) Premier League it's more open. ""These last years we could see a lot of surprises, and from the bottom (a team) could beat the first one. It was exciting and the Bundesliga was good to see. Bayern Munich is heading away a little bit so we will see how it develops in the future."" Bayern's historic treble confirmed them as the dominant force in Germany, and with their considerable financial muscle, they are already planning on extending their superiority over the rest. Shortly before the end of the season it was announced that Mario Gotze -- one of Dortmund's best players -- would be joining Bayern for $49 million, with striker Robert Lewandowski expected to make a similar move in the coming weeks. While the man who masterminded Bayern's success in 2013, Jupp Heynckes, is retiring, his replacement is Pep Guardiola, who won a total of 14 trophies in four years as coach of Barcelona. So how can the other teams, Dortmund included, keep up with the Bayern juggernaut? ""With money,"" Ballack jokes. ""No, it's difficult for the weaker teams to close the gap because like I said, the bigger teams still invest, and they could invest. ""If you take Bayern Munich, they just bought six months ago Javi Martinez for $52 million, now Gotze for $49 million. So that's a lot of money and it's not possible I think to do it for any other club in Germany. ""It is just Bayern Munich who has this good position, and from a financial point really good, and really healthy. And that's important. ""Dortmund as well, they are trying to close the gap between them and the other teams, but of course Bayern Munich are far away from the others."" Guardiola comes with a reputation as one of the game's leading coaches, but given the standards Bayern set this season, Ballack thinks the Spaniard will struggle to improve the team. ""I think sometimes when you come in (as a new coach) you think 'I have to change something.' But if you see this Bayern Munich team now, I can't really see where he needs to change. ""Obviously he has his own idea of football and how he wants to play. I'm sure he's seen a lot of games, if not all, in the last six months from Bayern Munich, and he knows there's not much to improve. ""It's an incredible level that they've played in the last six months or the last year. And like I said before, the little details. Maybe change something just to change something because you want to play your own style. ""But on the other side, like I said, you can't really change a lot because everything works well. But I'm sure he's a smart guy and a good coach, and he will handle it."" Ballack's farewell match in Leipzig saw a World XI, coached by new Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, take on a Germany XI, coached by Rudi Voller. Former teammates Didier Drogba, now at Galatasaray, Ukrainian Andriy Shevchenko, Bayern captain Philipp Lahm and seven-time Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher, among others, took part. Mourinho managed Ballack at Chelsea and has now returned to London for a second stint after his three-year tenure at Real Madrid ended in disappointment. One of the Portuguese's first engagements will be to renew his rivalry with Guardiola when Chelsea play Bayern in the UEFA Super Cup at the end of August. And Ballack, who won one Premier League title and two FA Cups in his four years at Chelsea, and three Bundesliga crowns with Bayern, says his time with Mourinho was a golden spell in his career. ""He has a fantastic reputation at (Chelsea), also I think in England. He's a charismatic manager and I really enjoyed working with him for two years and most of the players as well I can say. ""I think (his image) is not always what you see in the media. What we have as players, is another picture. And that's the picture in the dressing room. ""It's the daily work with him on the pitch and his speeches when he talks to us. And that's what I can say is special, because his attitude, his personality, if he comes in front of the group if he talks to us. ""What's fantastic is he brought the team behind him. And that shows not just in Chelsea, he also adapted really well on the international (stage). He worked in Italy, he worked in Spain, and everywhere he had success.""","Michael Ballack tells CNN the dominance of Dortmund and Bayern is bad for Germany .

"(CNN) -- This month, Inside the Middle East travels to Beirut, the cosmopolitan, multi-lingual capital of Lebanon. Beirut's popularity among expatriate residents has not waned, despite the increased fears of instability spilling over from the conflict in neighboring Syria. Host Arwa Damon explores Beirut, discovering why the ""Paris of the Middle East"" is so appealing to foreign residents of the city. Expats may be flocking to Beirut, but not everyone is welcome. Many economic migrants in Beirut struggle with racism on a daily basis. Lebanon's minister of tourism says the country has implemented a zero-tolerance policy towards racism -- but Damon finds out why it's going to take more than legislation to change the attitude of the Lebanese. We also explore the rights of women in Lebanon, a nation traditionally known for its tolerance towards the opposite sex. Women's rights activists say they have a false sense of freedom. There are few laws in Lebanon protecting women from domestic abuse and hardly any representation in parliament, but some Lebanese women are now demanding change. Finally, the program meets the alternative rock band Mashrou' Laila, a group of seven 20-somethings living in Beirut. Mashrou' Laila has become a major hit in Lebanon by taking on taboo topics in their music, singing about everything from politics to homosexuality. SHOWTIMES .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- They've been described as the voice of their generation -- though not one that everyone is comfortable hearing. Mashrou' Leila, whose name translates as ""The Night Project,"" is a controversial alternative rock band from Lebanon, whose music has served as something of a soundtrack to the Arab Spring for many young people throughout the region. Formed at the American University of Beirut in 2008, the multi-confessional, seven-piece band has won a legion of fans throughout the Middle East with lyrics that speak to the daily realities and aspirations of young Arabs, frankly addressing taboo topics such as politics, sexuality and religion. The group was simply interested in making music that honestly reflected its members' experiences, keyboardist Omaya Malaeb told CNN. ""The things we talk about, for us, they're not anything very extreme or very unusual. They are really realistic situations that each one of us goes through."" The group was given rich material to mine simply by the daily realities of life in the Lebanese capital, described in the band's online bio as a ""city that tastes of the absurd,"" characterized by chronic insecurity and full of ""musical bombshells, incoherent sexuality and thrusting pleasure."" ""Our daily lives were the major inspiration, being young people and part of a changing country trying to form its future in a very sensitive period,"" said guitarist Firas Abu-Fakhr. Read more: Lebanese women take on judges who call rape a ""marital right"" This contrasted with much of the mainstream pop from the region, which shied away from addressing anything substantive in its lyrics. ""The people who produce pop music... don't really deal with any topics that really relate to real daily issues,"" he said. But not everybody has appreciated their approach, said Malaeb, the sole female member of the band. ""For other people, this seems a bit too bold,"" she said. The band's expressive music has earned them their share of critics as they have risen to prominence. In 2010, when the group became the first Lebanese act to headline the Byblos International Festival -- one of Lebanon's largest music events -- then-Prime Minister Saad Hariri reportedly left midway through the performance, after the band played a song with swearing in the lyrics. Read more: Tackling Lebanon's racism problem . Lead singer and songwriter Hamed Sinno said the group does not actively court controversy, but is not interested in toning down their act to win mainstream approval. ""It's not like we try to bother people. But we haven't really tried to inhibit ourselves,"" he said. ""I guess that we haven't tried to censor ourselves bothers people, because we're rather explicit about the world -- sometimes in ways that are disagreeable for a lot of people."" Most controversially, he says, ""we're rather explicit about our sexuality."" Sinno is openly gay, a rarity for performers in a region where homophobic attitudes prevail. He has draped himself in a rainbow flag onstage, and written lyrics from the perspective of a gay lover in songs such as ""Smell the Jasmine."" It reflected the band's goal to transcend stereotypes, and create art that communicated the complicated realities of a new generation in the Middle East, said Malaeb -- an honesty that has seen Mashrou' Leila perform to fans in Tunis, Cairo, Abu Dhabi, Amman and even Novi Sad, Serbia. ""Lebanon has more to offer than the commercial music that you hear on the radio,"" she said. ""We're trying to do something that speaks more to us.""","Mashrou' Leila is a seven-piece alternative rock band from Beirut .

"(Oprah.com) -- Five women who were stuck in unfulfilling relationships share their wake-up moments. Alexis Smith: ""I wanted to believe him"" Her story Alexis was a party girl studying fashion, and George was a shy art student when they met in college. ""We were attracted to what the other had to offer,"" Alexis says. After years of dating, she married George, shortly after giving birth to their first son. Alexis began to notice a change in her marriage once her husband opened an art gallery and started staying out late. George admitted to cheating on Alexis while she was pregnant with their third child. Wake-up moment George begged forgiveness, and Alexis, who was eight months pregnant, gave him another chance. They moved from Manhattan to a quaint country house. But, on the first Christmas Eve in their new home, Alexis discovered that George was in love with another woman and decided that it was time to leave him -- for good. Resolution George moved out, and Alexis was on her own. That's when she realized she'd been on her own for years. When George was once again ready to reconcile, Alexis had an epiphany: ""If I go back now, I'll lose any self-respect I've mustered over the past months."" She carried on building up her own clothing line and then, unexpectedly, fell in love. ""I never thought I'd find love again. Or that someone would love me for me."" Oprah.com: Is he cheating? How to tell . Myra Tillotson Nuriddin: ""Seven years of invisibility piled up"" Her story Myra was 47 years old and divorced when she met Sulaiman, a man who had 10 children from three previous relationships. Myra, mother to a grown son, and Sulaiman eventually said their ""I dos."" Their decision not to invite all of Sulaiman's children to the wedding backfired, and Myra's relationship with her stepchildren suffered. Tension built up for years, and Myra often felt disrespected and resented by Sulaiman's children. ""But if I brought it up with Sulaiman, he'd say, 'Don't play children's games -- you'll never win,'"" Myra says. Wake-up moment One Christmas Eve, Myra invited all of Sulaiman's children over for dinner. After a full day of cooking, her stepchildren trickled in more than an hour late. Angry and hurt, Myra remembers Sulaiman's oldest son walking right past her when he finally arrived for dinner. ""Seven years of painful invisibility piled up into that one moment, and I lost it,"" Myra says. Resolution After confronting Sulaiman with her concerns, she found a therapist who suggested that she and Sulaiman try an Imago workshop focusing on couples and communication. At the workshop, they learned how to ""mirror"" each other. ""When I'm angry, Sulaiman repeats what I'm saying to him before he responds. That calms me instantly,"" Myra says. The Imago method has also helped work things out with her stepchildren. For their 10th wedding anniversary, Myra and Sulaiman renewed their vows. ""All the kids were invited,"" Myra says. ""When I first said 'I do' to Sulaiman, I thought it was just the two of us. This second time around, I knew it was actually 13."" Oprah.com: 12 simple ways to have better sex . Michelle Barrett: ""We'd get meaner with every fight"" Her story Michelle began dating Joe, a rival marketing rep who proposed a year later over ice cream cones in the park. Soon after, the fighting began. ""We were constantly getting into stupid arguments that left me feeling alone,"" Michelle says. They sought help but the arguments continued to escalate. ""We'd get meaner with each fight,"" Michelle recalls. ""I threatened to leave, and he called my bluff. That's when I got really scared."" Wake-up moment Michelle's biggest fear was losing Joe. A friend mentioned a weekend ""reconnecting"" workshop for couples, but Michelle had burned out on therapists. Faced with a decision, Michelle's mother asked her, ""If you don't do this, are you prepared to live with the consequences?"" That struck Michelle like lightning. ""Joe and I were in a hurtful holding pattern,"" she says. ""My mom's words jolted me into action."" Resolution At the workshop, the first exercise was an exorcism. ""We had to act out a scary childhood moment,"" Michelle recalls. ""[My stepfather] was extremely verbally abusive to me, and my model for how men acted. So if Joe disagreed with me, I'd hear my stepfather and freak out."" Following the workshop, Michelle confronted her stepfather, who apologized for treating her badly. Now, she says, ""whenever I'm mad at Joe, I ask myself, 'What's this really about?'"" As a result, the arguments don't escalate. ""We love each other too much to let minor blowups tear us apart,"" Michelle says. Oprah.com: What's timing got to do with it? How to pace your relationship so it lasts . Megan Davis: ""I wanted to help him get better"" Her story Megan met Greg while studying abroad in Australia. He was a free spirit who often needed time by himself and would often go off for weekends alone. Meanwhile, Megan took on all the domestic duties of their relationship. ""I was so often worried about his feelings that I would do all these things to make his life easier,"" she says. After eight years of dating, Greg confessed to Megan that he was depressed and began taking antidepressants. Soon after, he proposed to Megan during a trip to Taiwan. Six weeks before their September wedding, Greg came home in tears and wanted to postpone the wedding. He started therapy and, two months later, asked Megan to join him in seeing the therapist. ""I readily agreed,"" she says. ""I wanted to help him get better."" Wake-up moment After eight sessions, Megan felt ""we were going in circles."" The therapist told them to work on their communication skills, but they still hadn't done the assignments from the first session. ""I knew then that I had done all I could, and that Greg's moodiness was going to be his lifelong struggle,"" Michelle says. ""I wanted him to be happy, but I finally realized that I couldn't do that for him."" Resolution At first, the loneliness was palpable. ""I spent my 20s with one man, and suddenly I was alone,"" she says. ""Regaining my self-confidence was hard."" Now, Michele says she knows she made the right decision. ""I have a therapist friend who once told me if I was meant to leave Greg, I'd know in my gut when the time came,"" she says. ""Acting on that moment made me realize I can trust myself.""

""I was very lonely and insecure -- and unlucky in love,"" she says. ""I thought he was as good as it would get for me."" They married, moved from Manhattan to Santa Barbara and started a family. ""My life seemed full, but it wasn't. I didn't love my husband,"" she says. ""I faulted myself for not liking him more -- he was a good man, but he was dull.""

After putting her kids to bed, she decided that she couldn't pretend anymore. ""My husband initiated sex,"" Sarah recalls. ""And I started crying. He asked, 'What's wrong?' I said, 'I don't want to do this anymore.'"" He didn't fight it. Resolution ""I had finally found the courage to leap,"" she says. Sarah signed up for Match.com several months after the split.

"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- A group of women basketball players in Saudi Arabia has been defying stereotypes as one of the few female sports teams in the kingdom. Saudi Arabia practices an austere form of Islam in which women are forbidden from playing sport in public -- as well as driving, or traveling without the permission of a male guardian. But Jeddah United, which has grown its membership over the past decade from a dozen to 350, mostly children of both genders, works around these restrictions by playing and practicing on a gender-segregated private court. Conservative clerics in Saudi Arabia have argued there are religious reasons for excluding women from sport. Sheikh Adnan Bahereth, who preaches in the holy city of Mecca, told CNN that form-fitting athletic clothing was immoral, and that women should be veiled and remain at home. But the female athletes of Jeddah United, based in Saudi Arabia's second-largest city, say that, although sport remains a minority pursuit among women in their country, attitudes are slowly changing. See also: Saudi women: Pampered or oppressed? ""Four years ago it was more of a taboo to talk about,"" said team captain Leena Al Maeena. ""Today, there's more acceptance. There's a lot more companies willing to support us. So, I really think as a society we are evolving."" Perhaps the biggest symbol of this shift was Saudi Arabia's announcement last month that it would allow female athletes to compete at the Olympics for the first time at the 2012 Games. Previously, the kingdom has been one of only three countries -- along with Brunei and Qatar -- that banned women from competing. All have now dropped the policy. See also: Qatar's first female Olympians . Yet no female athletes have been identified so far to represent Saudi Arabia in London, and if women are sent to compete, they will still face restrictions. Women athletes must have their male guardian's permission and be accompanied by him to all events, wear appropriate Islamic dress, and refrain from mixing with men during the event. Jeddah United's Hadeer Sadagah, 18, dreams of someday competing at the Olympics, but said: ""The society is still not accepting of Saudi women playing sports."" But Al Maeena says attitudes towards female athletes are changing, and much of the reason is growing public awareness of the health benefits of sport. Basketball helped her overcome post-partum depression following the birth of her first child. ""I felt like I needed something to get better,"" she said. Others in the team had played basketball to help them in their battle with eating and body-image disorders. ""It really helped all these women. They went back to their normal lifestyle,"" Al Maeena said. ""We just looked at it as something not just from an entertainment point of view. It's bigger than that."" While the women still receive criticism from conservatives, it does not deter them from taking to the court. ""We're having fun, we're all girls. We're doing something that's healthy for our bodies and our minds,"" said 24-year-old Nour Fitiany. Al Maeena said she hoped the team's example would help encourage public debate about women in sport, and demonstrate to ""the opposing segments in society that we're not going against our religious or cultural beliefs."" ""At the end of the day, we're all law-abiding citizens who want to develop our youth,"" she said. ""We don't want them to get into smoking and drugs and wasting their time.""

"(CNN) -- Authorities in the Palestinian town of Bethlehem are hoping it won't be a silent night this Christmas Eve, following a spate of tourist cancellations due to recent violence in Gaza. The West Bank town of around 29,000 people, eight kilometers (five miles) south of Jerusalem, contains the Church of the Nativity, venerated by Christians as the birthplace of Jesus. One of the oldest surviving Christian churches in the world, it has been considered the site of Christ's birth since at least the 2nd century, and is the most significant tourist attraction in the Palestinian territories. But Palestinian authorities are concerned that the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas will deter pilgrims from visiting the site during the traditional Christmas boom season this month. Conflict's impact . Although Israel's conflict was with Hamas -- the Islamist group which controls the other Palestinian territory of Gaza, located about 70 kilometers away -- the week-long bout of violence prompted many potential visitors to Bethlehem to cancel their bookings. ""It's had a big impact,"" said Jiries Qumsiyeh, spokesman for the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. ""We've had some cancellations."" Bethlehem drew about 140,000 visitors -- many of them religious pilgrims -- in the two weeks around Christmas last year, said Qumsiyeh, providing an important boost to the Palestinian economy. Carmen Ghattas, spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Municipality, said she feared that would not be the case this season. ""We expected a decrease in tourism, and many tourists have canceled,"" she said. ""This season if the tourists do not come we will not have a good economic situation, and the citizens will be affected."" While Gaza sustained most of the damage from the recent conflict, the West Bank was not totally removed from the violence, she said, as ""rockets from Gaza were shot at Jerusalem."" U.N. boost . But despite the violence scaring off some potential visitors, respite may come from the recent successful Palestinian bid for an upgrade in status at the United Nations. In late November, the U.N.'s general assembly voted to elevate the status of the Palestinian delegation from ""non-member observer entity"" to ""non-member observer state,"" the same category as the Vatican. Palestinians hope the upgraded recognition will provide new leverage in their dealings with Israel. Ghattas said the United Nations vote prompted an influx of new bookings, but not enough yet to offset cancellations. ""Before the vote, the situation wasn't secure. But now it is like the whole world -- the United Nations -- is supervising any attack that might happen,"" she said. ""That will protect us and protect our visitors from all over the world."" Qumsiyeh said he expected the vote to have a positive ongoing effect on tourism to the Palestinian territories. A recent report, commissioned by the Bethlehem Center for Cultural Heritage Preservation, looking at tourism development, found Bethlehem was not capitalizing on its potential. The majority of visitors were day trippers on short visits from Israel, meaning the full economic benefits of tourism did not flow into the local community. ""It will give us a chance to promote Palestine and for people to know more about Palestine,"" he said. World Heritage status . In June, the Church of the Nativity and surrounding pilgrimage route became the first Palestinian World Heritage site. Its inscription on to the prestigious list of sites -- deemed as holding ""outstanding universal value"" as part of the world's shared heritage -- came after the Palestinians were granted membership of UNESCO, the United Nations' heritage body in 2011. One of Christianity's most holy places, the church -- which features a 14-pointed silver star set into the marble floor marking the precise spot where Jesus is said to have been born -- drew two million visitors in 2011, according to local heritage expert Nada Atrash, of Bethlehem's Center for Cultural Heritage Preservation. Christian solidarity . One recent visitor told CNN that the volatility of the region should not deter pilgrims. Roger Evans, a Catholic deacon from Chislehurst, England, was on a tour of the Holy Land with nine others from his parish when the hostilities in Gaza broke out in November. ""We were up on hills looking across Jerusalem, looking across at the Dome of the Rock and we saw a plume of smoke in the distance, which was a rocket landing,"" he said. ""We heard small arms fire, saw the reservists being called out."" Despite witnessing signs of the conflict, the situation did not affect the tour ""at all,"" he said, encouraging other Christians to make the pilgrimage unless there were official warnings to stay away. He had made the trip, ""to bring the Bible to life, to see the places where Jesus walked, talked, taught,"" he said. ""Until you see it you can't really imagine the distances and where he went and what happened in those days. Seeing the desolation in places, all those things bring to mind some of the parables that come to life in the scriptures."" Jill Didino, of UK Christian tourism company Tangney Tours, said the company had received an influx of interest in a forthcoming tour of the Holy Land following the violence in Gaza. She believed it was motivated by a sense of Christian solidarity. ""Often the group leaders feel that at times like these you really do have to go out and support the Christians, because they desperately need the support."" Ghattas said that authorities remained hopeful the number of visitor bookings would recover so pilgrims could enjoy the city's planned events, which included a Christmas tree lighting ceremony on December 15, and a choral festival before midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. ""They're optimistic that the numbers will go up, and it will be safe here,"" she said. ""Christmas is a period where people all around the world come to Palestine. It's a center of attention and a time of peace. I don't think any political conflicts will happen during that period -- we hope.

"Al-Ain, UAE (CNN) -- A British boy and his father are about to embark on the journey of a lifetime, traveling across the Middle East and Europe by land and sea after 11-year-old Joe Thompson suddenly developed a paralyzing fear of flying. Thompson, who had previously always loved flying, says he cannot explain what came over him on July 1 at Abu Dhabi airport - an hour by car from his home in Al-Ain -- as his family prepared to relocate to the UK from the United Arab Emirates. ""Everything just went horrible for me,"" says Joe, recalling that day. ""I just went into body lockdown. I kept on crying. I sat down and I couldn't move. I just couldn't do it."" Joe's father has no idea what caused the incident. ""He's been flying since he was three months old,"" Tony Thompson tells CNN. ""We didn't expect it at all and really still don't know what triggered it. ""My initial reaction was 'come on, just get on the plane, it'll be fine,'"" says Tony, sitting in the small apartment he's borrowing from friends who are out of town. ""But then I realized that no, it was far more serious than this."" The challenge has been finding an alternative travel option by land and sea that takes them across the Middle East, while avoiding deadly conflict areas. The flight from Abu Dhabi to London is eight hours long, crossing a distance of about 3,500 miles (5,600 km), as the crow flies. The most direct land route would take the pair straight through some of the region's most dangerous areas, including the Iraqi capital Baghdad, into war-torn Syria and straight through the embattled city of Aleppo to the Turkish border and on to Europe. ""Obviously that's not an option,"" says Tony. The maritime alternative is to sail around the Arabian Peninsula, braving the pirate-infested waters off the coast of Yemen then up through the Suez Canal past the Egyptian hot spot of Sinai where a military operation remains under way. But the option of a safer land route has emerged. After earlier being denied entry visas by the UAE's Saudi Arabia embassy, the Saudi ambassador in London, Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf al Saud, intervened to help. The freshly-minted Saudi visas in their passports mean Tony and Joe can now take a bus through the Saudi and Jordanian capitals, a car to the Israeli port city of Haifa, then a boat to a European Mediterranean city. The trip is expected to take 12 to 15 days and has suffered multiple false starts as the Thompsons try to line up the logistics of visas, border crossings and travel time timetables in a part of the world where buses and ferries don't tend to conform to strict schedules. It's been more than six weeks since Joe was scheduled to fly home. With his new school in the UK scheduled to start on September 4, time is not on their side. Yet Joe insists that flying is still not an option. ""It may be easy for you, but for me it's the most terrifying thing in the world,"" says Joe, who is currently spending his days playing computer games with friends and occasionally practicing rugby with his father in the scorching 48 degree Celsius August heat. Joe has tried flying home four times. Once, he made it as far as the flight cabin but panicked when the captain announced they were shutting the doors. ""So immediately I knew what I had to do,"" says Joe who thinks he may be claustrophobic. ""I just got over the chairs, went around into the aisle and sprinted out [of the plane.]"" His father says they have tried various treatments including hypnotherapy and psychiatric consults. He says the medical center at the airport even gave his son a sedative injection before the flight, but Joe was still so upset that the flight crew deemed him unfit to fly. ""It is a little frustrating,"" says Tony who describes the whole ordeal as a roller coaster. ""At first it was all a bit of an adventure but now it's become more of a burden."" Father and son both say they're looking forward to the journey and reuniting with Joe's mother and sister at home. It is a rare opportunity for a young boy to gain first-hand knowledge of the geography and geopolitics of a region that often leads the news headlines. On this occasion though, it seems Joe has himself become the headline.","Joe Thompson, 11, struck by sudden fear of flying on journey from United Arab Emirates to UK .

"Muscat, Oman (CNN) -- Bone-chilling cold is virtually unimaginable to the people of Oman, where temperatures routinely hit 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the hot season. So when Bader Al Lawati and Ameer Abdulhussain first began experiencing temperatures as low as minus 35 degrees Celsius -- for two hours a time, three times a week, over a period of six months -- they found it ""a bit of a shock"" to say the least, said Al Lawati. ""That was the first time we were exposed to something that cold,"" said the 27-year-old. The pair -- who refer to themselves as ""the Freezing Omanis"" -- subjected themselves to the grueling sessions in an industrial freezer near the capital, Muscat, to acclimatise ahead of a far greater challenge ahead. Earlier this month, they set off from Ushuaia, Argentina on a two-week expedition to Antarctica as part of the Antarctic Youth Ambassador Program, operated by 2041, an environmental NGO committed to protecting the frozen continent. Their trip, alongside 28 other participants from across the world, is intended to promote environmental protection of Antarctica and ensure the extension of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty -- the treaty prohibiting drilling and mining on the southern continent that runs until 2041. ""We obviously know we need to do a lot of physical training, a lot of stamina, endurance training... to get our physical ability up to standard,"" said Abdulhussain. ""But then comes the whole aspect of the cold. It's extremely cold down there, extremely windy."" Read more: Beauty and the beast in the UAE. While Antarctica might seem a world removed from Oman, the pair don't see it that way. ""Instead of thinking of Oman just as Oman, think of the world as one single ecosystem,"" said Al Lawati. Oman, with its diverse, and in many places unspoiled landscape, has been something of a regional leader in environmental awareness. It was the first country in the Gulf to launch an environmental agency, although it still has some way to go. Oman is ranked 110 out of 132 nations surveyed in environmental sustainability over the past decade, according to Yale University's 2012 Environmental Performance Index. Al Lawati said the coastline where his grandfather taught him to fish and swim as a child is now routinely covered in litter. ""Anywhere around the shoreline you find fishing nets discarded, plastic bags, cans... trash all around. That shouldn't happen with a place this beautiful."" But Lamees Daar, the executive director of conservation NGO the Environment Society of Oman, said the country intended to learn from the errors of other nations by preserving its environment. ""We are very lucky we're at a time where industry and tourism is coming up in Oman, and we can make that difference now and learn from other peoples' mistakes around the world,"" he said. The ""Freezing Omanis"" say that once they're back from Antarctica they will have a renewed purpose to campaign for the environment at home. ""I want to come back and learn how to preserve that more,"" said Al Lawati.","A pair of Omani environmental activists have joined an Antarctic expedition .

"Beirut (CNN) -- At first glance, the brightness of the colors might just be enough to fool the casual viewer. But this abstract scene in ""Play in the City"" isn't a cheerful one. Pain infuses this painting. ""Here's a person who wants to kill another person,"" says artist Anas Homsi, as he points towards a menacing figure in the composition, ""And here's a person who wants to defend this person from being killed. "" Homsi's canvas is inspired by conflict - namely, the brutal civil war raging in his homeland of Syria. It's just one of several works on display at the Joanna Seikaly Gallery in Beirut. In the exhibit, entitled ""True Colors"", Homsi along with two other Syrian artists, Wissam Shaabi and Fadi Al Hamwi, tackle warfare through works encompassing themes such as hope, survival and society. ""The violence pushes me to work more, to draw and paint,"" explains Homsi, an intense young man who's well aware how much he's been impacted by the violence. ""It's apparent in the faces,"" he says, describing the characters who inhabit another one of his creations, ""the abnormalities - these are internal abnormalities more than external."" Homsi's striking images are made all the more poignant when he describes the horror of learning how close relatives of his were recently executed. ""I never imagined this would happen to anyone in my family,"" explains a visibly upset Homsi, ""Or that I would hear this news about anybody in my life."" Exiled Syrian writer honored . For Homsi and his colleagues, art is what keeps them going through the toughest of times. As it turns out, the men aren't just close friends, they're also former classmates, having studied together at the University of Damascus' Faculty of Fine Art. While the art scene in Damascus had been growing more vibrant before the start of Syria's civil war, it quickly changed once clashes spread. ""There's more Syrian artists being showcased in Lebanon because most of the galleries closed in Syria, especially in Damascus,"" says gallery owner Joanna Seikaly. For Seikaly, who feels the art scene in Lebanon has grown somewhat stagnant, this showcase is a timely one. ""It's important to highlight the situation that's going on in Syria,"" says Seikaly, who adds that several Syrian artists who fled the fighting have ended up in Beirut. Young Syrian amputee makes dangerous journey to find help . For Shaabi, who left for Lebanon once it got too dangerous at home, it has been hard to remain optimistic. But he's determined to do so. ""The only thing that keeps us running and living is hope,"" the soft-spoken artist adds. It's hope that Shaabi tries to convey more than anything else in his paintings. Dreamlike images in which bright colors offset an approaching darkness. ""You know, art is all about a message,"" explains Shaabi. ""You send the message for the people."" In ""City of Hope"", Shaabi presents an idealized vision of peaceful coexistence - hustle and bustle in an urban environment free of strife. The symbolism couldn't be more striking. A closer look reveals both a crescent and a cross in this cityscape. ""We will remain looking for the future,"" says Shaabi. ""For a bright future. That's the whole idea."" Just around the corner, however, the works of Fadi Al-Hamwi highlight a very different feeling - one of dread. ""You feel fear,"" says Al-Hamwi. ""You feel like anytime something can happen."" As the last member of this group still living in Damascus, angst is part of his everyday reality. ""I'm inside Syria. I can see the people. I can connect with them till now,"" he says. That connection informs his art; pieces full of foreboding. In ""Stinkbomb"", a dying man is on display, with a gas mask on his face and a rose in his hand - clinging to hope while slipping away. Melancholy seems to pervade Al-Hamwi's personality. ""Sometimes when you feel down - you feel all these people are dead, you feel like your country is just destroyed - you feel you should do something maybe different than art"" But those doubts don't last long. Al-Hamwi sees his job as a necessary one; that as an artist, he must document what he's feeling and seeing. ""We feel sad, we feel tired. So for sure this will show in your colors."" The colors are as vivid as life - from artists taking their audience on an artistic journey that constantly reminds of death.","Syria's brutal civil war depicted in Beirut exhibition .

"(CNN) -- When I was a small child, I spent many afternoons on my father's lap seeing qat being chewed in front of my eyes. In fact, I used to innocently help my father and hand him the greenish leaves from the plastic bag that was seated right next to us. My father, like almost all men in Yemen, would spend every afternoon, every day of the week and every month of the whole year chewing qat starting from afternoon until late at night. Now I'm joining a campaign against this leafy narcotic because of the devastating effect it has on my country. Aside from the effect that the drug has on individuals, production of qat is using up almost a third of groundwater in a country that suffers chronic water shortages. We are calling for a ""No Qat Day"" on April 12, asking the government to completely ban qat from its offices. There are several reasons that my father -- and more than 90% of Yemeni men -- chew qat for many hours a day. Chief among these is the excitement they obtain from it and the relaxing and sociable atmosphere it generates. Little did I know as a child the catastrophic effect it has on life in Yemen. Chewing qat is a major cultural phenomenon in Yemen and many East African countries. It used to be socially unacceptable for women to chew qat but nowadays a great number of women chew qat. Today, almost 90% of my female relatives chew qat. I myself have tried it once. Qat is an integral part of Yemen's society because of two factors. The first factor is that during qat sessions contacts are made, business deals are sealed and social and even governmental decisions are made. The second factor is qat induces a state of euphoria and elation with feelings of increased alertness and arousal. It contains cathinone, a natural amphetamine that in the United States is a Schedule one drug, alongside heroin and cocaine. In 1980, the World Health Organization classified qat as a drug of abuse that can generate light to moderate psychological dependence and not necessarily addictiveness. More alarming, qat farmers usually sprinkle pesticide residues on it, which causes cancers, liver cirrhosis and kidney disease. This destructive leaf is not only lethal for qat chewers but also for Yemen as a state. ""Cultivated areas of qat have increased from less than 10,000 hectares in the early 1970s to 146,810 in 2008,"" said Dr Nasser Abdullah al-Aulaqi, former Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, in a study paper quoted in the Yemen Observer in January 2012. ""The gravity of the situation lies in the depletion of groundwater with qat eating up almost 30% of the natural reserves. Qat production generated in 2008 approximately 246 billion Yemeni Rial ($1.1billion), while fruits and vegetables brought in 276 billion Yemeni Rial ($1.3billion) and grains 91 billion ($422million),"" he continued. Qat is consuming a huge percentage of Yemen's water, when many experts predict that Yemen will be the first country in the world to run out of water in the near future. Qat embodies a great threat to Yemen's development socially, economically and environmentally. There have been numerous campaigns to fight qat and the most recent one was created by Hind al-Eryani, a Yemeni political analyst in social media living in Lebanon. ""This campaign is an expansion for the first campaign (No Qat Day) that occurred on January 12. It was relatively successful. The current campaign calls for the government to ban qat from governmental facilities,"" she explains. ""Meaning, to ban employees from chewing qat at those institutions because it's a troubling side of Yemen. ""There is a collective neglect in Yemen to this issue when it's threatening. Employees at governmental facilities, teachers in school, lecturers at colleges chew qat publicly and that's awful. ""At least we must start with those educated working people to eliminate the consumption of qat, which will assist tackling the water shortage,"" she adds. Also on Inside the Middle East: Abused animals in Lebanon face losing safe haven . In 1972, Yemen's former Prime Minister Mohsen al-Aini designed a plan to fight qat with the assistance of religious figures, saying that Qat was sinful. His attempt completely failed. After that, there was no concrete effort from the government to fight qat. However, today there is a hope with the grass-root efforts. Al-Eryani has tens of organizers from local civil-society organizations throughout the country that will run sessions on this issue and distribute posters to people and government employees. She also has endorsement from very influential figures, like Nobel Peace Prize laureate Tawakkul Karman; prominent researcher and writer Dr Azmi Bishara; former Yemeni representative to the Arab League Abdel-Malik Mansour, and others. Al-Eryani believes the campaign will be a success. Moreover, most of Yemen's media outlets will cover the campaign after Ali al-Amrani, the Minister of Information officially ordered them to do so, and schools throughout the country will run activities to raise awareness about qat's danger after Dr. Abdel-Razaq al-Ashwal, Minister of Education officially ordered them to do so. On top of all that, Omar al-Hemyeri, a Yemeni lawyer, designed a draft for a law to be legislated at the parliament. The draft suggests passing a law that bans chewing qat from governmental facilities. Yemenis kicked out former president Saleh from power but will they kick out qat as well? We shall wait and see. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Afrah Nasser.","More than 90% of Yemeni men chew qat, says Yemeni journalist Afrah Nasser .

"(CNN) -- This month, Inside the Middle East journeys to Israel and the Palestinian Territories. Host Leone Lakhani strolls along the ramparts of the wall surrounding the old city of Jerusalem, a place of enormous spiritual and cultural significance for Jews, Christians and Muslims alike. Millions of tourists visit Jerusalem each year, but for some, the experience triggers overwhelming emotions - that could even land you in a hospital. Next door, in the West Bank, some Palestinians are living the high life in Ramallah. The city has experienced a recent boom of five-star restaurants, cafes, and even hip nightclubs. But much of it was financed on credit, and with the economy struggling throughout the occupied territories, many Palestinians are now starting to wonder when the bubble will burst. In Tel Aviv, we meet Daphni Leef, a young Israeli activist whose calls for social justice led to the largest protest in the country's history. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in 2011, demanding economic change. This year, however, Leef and other activists are struggling to rekindle the mood that led to those demonstrations - despite rising inflation and increased taxes. Finally, we meet an Israeli woman of Iranian descent who is trying to bridge the growing political divide between Israel and Iran. Rita Yahan-Farouz is a 50-year-old pop star and one of the biggest singing sensations in both countries. Watch the September show at the following times (all GMT): .

"(CNN) -- Artists Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige have spent the last 13 years collecting the spam and scam emails that most of us delete from our junk folders. Their content -- from pleas for sympathy and money to promises of easy fortune -- give an alternative history of the world over the past decade, according to Hadjithomas and Joreige, both from Lebanon. A video installation, called ""A Letter Can Always Reach Its Destination,"" featuring people reading from scam emails, is one of the five winning pieces of the Abraaj Capital Art Prize unveiled at Art Dubai this week. (March 20). It is the world's only art prize specifically for Middle Eastern, North African and South Asian artists and the only one that rewards proposals rather than finished artworks, say the organizers. The winners were announced last October, and the artists had five months to work on their pieces. The other four winners were Palestinian artist Taysir Batniji, Wael Shawky from Egypt, Risham Syed from Pakistan and Raed Yassin from Lebanon. Hadjithomas said they chose 45 emails to read out for ""A Letter Can Always Reach its Destination"" from some 4,000 received over the years. ""In our work we are very interested in the way you write history,"" said Hadjithomas. ""The scammers chose places where corruption is possible, such as Africa, the Middle East or Russia, and base their stories around real events and conflicts in these countries. ""Sometimes they claim to be close to the protagonists of the events, such as the son of an African dictator. ""You can read a kind of history of the world over the last 10 years in a different way through these emails. ""You can understand a lot about African conflicts, Iraq, Libya, Russia or what was happening in other parts of the world."" The video features ordinary people reading emails originating from their own countries. The stories sounds convincing until they mention the $35 million they have, said Hadjithomas. ""They are melodramatic stories about people dying, cancer and disease. We chose ones that were well written, even if their English was poor. ""Sometimes the stories are not very far from their lives of the people reading them and some were very touching to film. You can be fooled by them for a while."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Can Baghdad be beautiful again? A more personal piece comes from the Palestinian artist Taysir Batniji, who produced ""To My Brother, which he describes as a tribute to his brother Mayssara, killed by an Israeli sniper during the First Intifada in 1987. ""To My Brother"" is a series of 60 inkless carvings on paper, tracing photographs from Mayssara's wedding in 1985. The pages look blank from a distance and only reveal their detail up close. ""My work is about disappearance in general and especially in the Palestinian context,"" said Batniji. ""This piece comes in the same line, but it is more personal. ""It was hard to begin work because when I started looking at the pictures, it was the first time I had looked at them since his death. ""After three months' work, I felt I was living with my brother again, being with him day by day."" Lebanese artist Raed Yassin combines his take on his country's civil war with the ancient tradition of recording military victories on vases. Lebanon has a history of political instability. In 1975 civil war broke out between Christians and the Muslim-PLO alliance. It raged for 15 years years, killing more than 100,000 people. His work ""China"" features seven Chinese porcelain vases featuring key battles from Lebanon's civil war. It is, according to the exhibition booklet, ""part-beautiful object, part-historical document, and part-mass-produced product."" The two remaining prize winners also give a modern twist to historical events or art forms. Wael Shawky, an Egyptian artist and filmmaker, produces a medieval marionette theater with ceramic dolls. The scene shown is taken from a painting by the French painter Jean Fouquet featuring Pope Urban II delivering a speech, which is thought to have led to the launch of the First Crusade one year later, in 1096. The curtains to the theater open for only a minute at a time, leading to the title, ""A Glimpse of Clean History."" Pakistani artist Risham Syed's work ""The Seven Seas"" is seven embroidered quilts featuring maps of port cities along trading routes of the former British empire. ""Apart from being trade gateways, these cities were also sites of resistance and rebellion against the imperial powers,"" says the exhibition booklet. Also on Inside the Middle East: Saudi women: Pampered or oppressed? Nat Muller, the Dutch guest curator of the Abraaj Capital Art Prize, said the works -- displayed under the title ""Spectral Imprints"" all follow a common theme. ""The works all refer to history and how we are living in a moment when the models we are used to are coming apart, from the Arab Spring, to financial crisis in Europe and America to the Occupy Movements,"" she said. ""It's the first time that there's a unified exhibition at Abraaj, that's my own little Arab Spring. The exhibition is more than the sum of its parts. The exhibits are strong, but also speak to each other to give a richer experience."" Muller said the $120,000 prize money given in advance based on proposals allowed artists to make work that would not otherwise have been possible. ""It's extremely important that there's production money because that's the most difficult thing for artists to find resources to concentrate on a piece they want to make,"" she said. ""It allows artists to venture outside their comfort zone and do things they would not normally do."" ""Now in Dubai there's an art scene that's maturing so these political and critical artworks can be appreciated in a place like this,"" added Muller.","Abraaj Capital Art Prize specifically for Middle Eastern, North African and South Asian artists, say organizers .

"(CNN) -- It's no Super Bowl. Heck, it's no Monday Night Football, but for an American audience, Monday's Manchester derby -- that is, the English club soccer game between Manchester's two Premier League teams -- is about as big as it gets stateside. Sure, many American sports fans call the sport boring and complain there's not enough scoring. It moves too slowly, they say, and is marred by prima donnas who flop to the ground if you breathe on them. Haters aside, the United States is taking notice. ESPN moved the game from ESPN 2 to its flagship station, a first for a weekday Premiership game. Pubs across the nation are anticipating big crowds, and some Americans are doing something very British for match day: skipping out of work early. ""You'll definitely want to see this. It's as high a stakes game as you'll see in any soccer league in the world,"" said Sports Illustrated senior writer and soccer guru, Grant Wahl. Wahl likened the match between No. 1 Manchester United and No. 2 Manchester City to the New York Jets and New York Giants playing in the Super Bowl, or perhaps the Iron Bowl, which pits cross-state rivals Auburn and Alabama against each other at the end of the college football season. Ferguson experience key to Manchester derby . He's never seen a Manchester derby this important in the 15 years he's been covering soccer, said Wahl, who authored the book, ""The Beckham Experiment: How the World's Most Famous Athlete Tried to Conquer America."" ESPN announced this week it moved the game to take advantage of the live edition of ""SportsCenter"" that will lead into the game, which begins at 3 p.m. ET. In an e-mail, spokesman Mac Nwulu said the paid programming on ESPN2 prior to the game typically draws about 221,000 viewers, where ""SportsCenter"" will have an expected audience of 482,000. The live lead-in is key to sports programming, he said. The network's English Premier League offerings on ESPN2 this year are 50% percent higher than last year's games, so English soccer's popularity is increasing in the U.S., Nwulu said. ""Best matchup of the season,"" Nwulu said of Monday's game. ""So far, 20 teams have each played an average of 36 matches. And with two match-days to go, EPL has one game that is akin to a title game in a league series not decided by knockouts."" We've come a long way . British sports commentator Ian Darke, who will be calling the game for ESPN, predicts a ""turbo-charged occasion"" and said he has noticed America's growing interest in soccer since ABC hired him to call games for the U.S.-hosted World Cup in 1994. ""Producers (back then) said to explain what offsides was and explain the laws of the game as we went along,"" he recalled. ""Now, there's been a complete change of emphasis."" Today, more Americans -- many of whom played the sport in school and youth leagues -- have a better grasp on the basics, and commentators cover games in a more ""authentic way, as if it were being broadcast for a European audience."" ESPN isn't the only one sensing the game taking off in the states. Hugh Folkerth, a bartender at Horse Brass Pub in Portland, Oregon, said that not so long ago Horse Brass was the premier place to watch English soccer in the city. As the game has become more popular, more bars carry the matches and more people get the games at home, so the number of patrons coming to watch soccer at Horse Brass has taken a hit. Of the derby Monday, Folkerth said he's received calls from people asking if he's showing it, and he expects a few more patrons than usual during the lunchtime rush. A CNN Facebook page asking if fans were planning to skip work or school Monday drew plenty of the aforementioned haters, but a handful of fans said they'd be playing hooky. ""Will be skipping class at University and have already re-scheduled couple meetings already,"" wrote Tejash Patel, a United fan. ""Work? School? Bills? Life? All of it stops when the Derby is in play!"" wrote fellow Red Devil Parker Smith. Added Oladeji Thompson, ""I'm coming home very early from work."" Continue the conversation on Facebook here . Fado Irish pubs in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta say they're expecting plenty of people to forsake their professors and employers. Both are tripling their staff. Austin general manager John O'Brien is expecting about 200 people for the game, which airs there at 2 p.m. In Atlanta, general manager Brian Russell said he is expecting a similar crowd. Though he's bringing in the doorman who generally works only on weekends, he's not anticipating any problems with the crowd, he said. ""We'll just make sure the volume is loud, the TVs are on and we have enough staff to get everyone food and drinks,"" Russell said. What's the big deal anyway? So, the uninitiated may be asking, why all the fuss over this particular game? Well, there are many storylines. The first is that it's a derby, so there's the longstanding city rivalry in addition to the championship implications. United's Old Trafford and City's Etihad Stadium are separated by about five miles, so you can imagine how the game divides friends, family, coworkers and neighbors. Sara Tomkins, assistant chief executive for the Manchester City Council, called it ""one of the most anticipated derbies this city has seen for a decade"" and said those not lucky enough to get tickets, which are commanding Â£1,300 ($2,115) online, will be filling up the city's pubs or gathering around the TV at home. Police aren't expecting problems, according to a statement from Superintendent John O'Hare, but they've asked local businesses to ""take extra safety measures such as using plastic glasses, employing more door staff and keeping an eye on the front of house. ... People will see extra patrols. This is not because we are expecting trouble; it is to make sure people feel safe to come and watch the match."" ESPN's Darke, who has been covering English derbies for almost 40 years, said he is expecting a rowdy and raucous atmosphere. ""Manchester's going to be quite a lively place, no matter the outcome. I might bring a tin helmet like the soldiers wear,"" he said with a chuckle. Another reason for the hullabaloo is that both teams are insanely wealthy. For United, the reigning English champs, this is nothing new. Founded in 1878, the team boasts 19 English championships and three European crowns. City, on the other hand, hasn't won the English title since 1968 and played unremarkably for the better part of four decades until Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan of the Abu Dhabi royal family bought the team in 2008. United has always been the ""glamour team"" with the big players, where City have been the forgettable step-relatives, and ""City fans are wearily philosophical about it,"" Darke said. ""City fans are sick to death of United ruling their roost, and here's their chance,"" he said. ""They will celebrate like there's no tomorrow if they pull it off."" Both teams are now among the most loaded clubs in the world. The professional services firm, Deloitte, reported that with â‚¬367 million ($487 million), United was No. 3 in revenues last year, behind Spanish powerhouses Real Madrid and Barcelona. City came in at 11th with â‚¬170 million ($225 million). To give you an idea what these figures mean, Forbes reported that average revenue among NFL teams in 2010 was $261 million. City and United have used their fortunes to acquire some of the biggest soccer names in the world: Wayne Rooney, Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Rio Ferdinand among them. The five dozen players on the two teams represent stars from 23 countries. ""(City) bought a lot of talent,"" said Sports Illustrated's Wahl. ""The question is whether they bought a great team. The questions are going to remain until they win a title."" Topsy-turvy . Also stoking interest in the match is soap-opera-like drama surrounding it. Not only has the injection of Middle Eastern cash made City more competitive, but the Blues thrashed the American-owned United 6-1 during their first meeting, a result Wahl called ""the most shocking result we've seen all year."" City stood atop the Premier League for months until March, when United seemed to find its form and took the lead. From there, it seemed a United repeat was inevitable, but in recent weeks, the tables have turned again. United has a win, loss and tie in its last three matches, while City has three wins. Each team's coach has engaged in a bit of psychological banter ahead of the fixture. United's Alex Ferguson has prohibited his team from making statements about the game, calling it the most important derby since he took over the club in 1986. City's Roberto Mancini cheekily fired back that the 6-1 drubbing earlier this year was more important. In a strange twist, he also said his team has no chance of winning the title and went so far as to congratulate United on its championship with three games remaining. Mancini simply knows his team performed better as underdogs this season than they did when they sat atop the table, Darke said. ""He knows how big this game is. Everything he's been saying in the last few days, he's trying to take pressure off his players,"" he said. ""It's the lousiest piece of psychological warfare ever."" United will have to go into Etihad, where City hasn't lost all season, and snatch three points to ensure their second championship in as many years. City is three points behind United, but with a win, can take the Premiership lead. They'll be tied with United in the points column but will take first place because they have scored one more goal than United and given up five fewer than the Reds this season. Though City is the favorite in the betting houses, no one seemed comfortable offering a prediction. Darke said his thoughts on the outcome were meaningless. ""Anything could happen. I'd just urge people to watch it,"" he said.","ESPN moves English club soccer game to flagship station for first time in history .

"Lahore (CNN) -- Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister whose government was overthrown by a military coup more than a decade ago, appears to be back on top in Pakistan, election officials said Sunday. According to unofficial results in Pakistan's violence-marred election, Sharif's party looks to have won most of the seats in the National Assembly. It won 16 of the 23 seats in the lower house, election officials said. Imran Khan, candidate for the Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) party, said the elections were rigged. ""Police (were) used, and how the -- the staff of the Election Commission were used,"" he said. ""And unfortunately it's because the provincial governments were in power right up till 20 days before the elections -- so they had plenty of time to place their people."" Still, democracy moved forward, he said. ""But I'm very optimistic that the foundation of what we call the new Pakistan has been laid,"" he said. ""Pakistan will never be the same again. ... Because of the youth participation and female participation, we have seen incredible scenes at this -- vibrancy at this -- in the elections."" His party won four seats in the lower house, election officials said. Further election results were not immediately available. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the election a historic democratic step. ""The Pakistani people stood up resiliently to threats by violent extremists,"" he said. ""We'll be working with the new government to advance shared interests including a peaceful, more prosperous and stable future for Pakistan and the region."" Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tweeted his congratulations to Sharif and the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz party on their ""emphatic victory."" Saturday's voting saw bursts of deadly violence aimed at polling stations that failed to deter Pakistanis keen to have their say in landmark national and provincial elections. Voter turnout was nearly 60%, the chief election commissioner said early Sunday. Many were voting for the first time. The national election marks the first transition between civilian governments in the nation's 66-year history. In its short existence, Pakistan has experienced three military coups and been ruled by generals for half its life. It remains mired in political turmoil. In March, the democratically elected government finished serving a full five-year term, paving the way for the elections. Street parties erupted in the cities of Lahore and Peshawar early Sunday, with hundreds of people celebrating even before the results of the vote were in. In his stronghold of Lahore, Sharif said he was confident his party will form the next government. He said he hopes his party won enough seats to form a government on its own but that he is willing to work with others to solve the country's problems. The Election Commission extended polling hours in some constituencies in the southern city of Karachi, where there were complaints about the vote. The Election Commission secretary, Ishtiak Ahmed Khan, told a news conference the election was free and fair across much of the country, despite the problems in Karachi. Aside from claims of irregularities, four blasts hit Karachi as people voted, killing 14 people and wounding dozens. Across the country, 29 people were killed in Election Day violence. Despite pre-election attacks, voters lined up at dawn at polling stations nationwide, eager to send off the caretaker government put in place in March. ""This is the first time I am voting and I am 60; I want change,"" said Shaheen Khan, who was at a polling station in Karachi, the nation's largest city. ""There were thousands of people when I came. ... The queue was so long, people in wheelchairs and crutches all waiting to vote."" Waits of three hours or more were reported at some polling stations. Election officials also reported delays in opening at some polls, the official Associated Press of Pakistan news agency reported. A statement from the office of interim Prime Minister Mir Hazar Khan Khoso thanked the people of Pakistan for ""coming out in huge numbers"" to vote, as well as everyone involved in participating in and organizing the elections. He voiced ""confidence that the next phase of counting of votes will also be completed smoothly,"" and reiterated the determination of the caretaker government to hand over power to the winners without delay. More vote-rigging claims . The leader of the governing Pakistan People's Party, Taj Haider, alleged vote rigging in some constituencies in Sindh province and its capital, Karachi, in a news conference broadcast by CNN affiliate Geo TV. Haider called on the country's Election Commission to hold a new vote in the affected constituencies. Leaders of the Sindh-based Muttahida Quami Movement, one of Pakistan's largest and most liberal parties, told reporters that they would boycott the elections over allegations of rigging. The Sunni Ittehad Council and Jamaat-e-Islami parties also announced a boycott, Geo TV reported. Many Pakistanis hope the polls will usher in reform in a country battling issues including corruption, a struggling economy and security threats. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned Saturday's election violence but said the militants' ""cowardly acts"" would not stop people from exercising their right to vote. An open letter from Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was attacked by the Taliban last year for her efforts to promote girls' education, urged everyone, and particularly women, to use their votes. ""If we want education, electricity and natural gas in our country, we must take a step,"" said her letter, published by Pakistan's Dawn website. ""Let's vote for our country. We never realized how much powerful our vote is. One vote can change our country."" Blasts target voters . In some cities, the insecurity was evident Saturday. Two of the blasts in Karachi targeted the Awami National Party office, killing 11 and wounding 36, said Naeem Shah, a spokesman for Karachi police. A third explosion was in the Karachi suburb of Landhi. It killed three people and wounded nine, according to the deputy commissioner of Malir district, Qazi Jan Mohammed. Voting continued afterward, he said. A fourth explosion, which wounded four people, was in the Peerabad area of Karachi, Shah said. Fakhruddin Ebrahim, the chief election commissioner for Pakistan, said he contacted the military over security concerns in Karachi and the harassment of polling station staff in the city. He said polling material was stolen in several areas. Eleven people were killed in two separate bombings in Pakistan's volatile Balochistan province, district police officer Allauddin Kasi said. One of the attacks was on a vehicle carrying voters who had cast their ballots, he said. Another targeted independent candidate Khadim Shah, the prime minister's office said in a statement condemning the bombing. Elsewhere in Balochistan, at least four people were killed and eight injured in a clash between two groups at a polling station, police official Sardar Muhammad said. In another incident, 12 Awami National Party supporters were hurt by a hand grenade thrown at a party electoral office in Quetta, said Syed Mobeen Ahmed, a deputy inspector general of police. Brig. Muhammad Abdur Raheem, the military spokesman for Balochistan, said polling still went well in the province apart from interruptions caused by a few incidents. There was a good turnout, including by women voters, he said. In the northwestern city of Peshawar, 12 people, children among them, were wounded when a bomb exploded at a polling station in a school, said Habibullah Arif, a local deputy commissioner. Record numbers . Of the 86 million voters registered to cast ballots, there were 36 million new voters, according to the Election Commission of Pakistan. There are more than twice as many women candidates as five years ago, with 161 running, compared with the 64 who contested the 2008 poll, according to the United Nations. As the nation makes the transition after years of mostly military rulers, the economic, political and security situation remains unstable. As well as high inflation and poverty rates, Pakistan has seen outbreaks of violence, in some cases by Islamic extremists. Since April, the Taliban in Pakistan have killed dozens in attacks on the three main political parties. Many urban voters and parties regard resurgent fundamentalism as one of the country's biggest threats. More than 600,000 security personnel were deployed nationwide leading up to the election, Information Minister Arif Nizami said Friday. Pakistan's army, which helped deliver 650 tons of ballots to polling stations, deployed 91,000 troops around the country, a military spokesman said. Fractured nation . The ruling Pakistan People's Party is led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of assassinated former prime minister and party leader Benazir Bhutto. While his party became the first civilian government to complete a full five-year term -- the three governments after the death in 1988 of military strongman Zia ul-Haq were all brought down by the army -- its legacy is a deeply fractured country with a faltering economy. The party's main opposition came from Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz. One of the country's leading industrialists and richest men, Sharif has been prime minister twice before and was overthrown in a coup when Gen. Pervez Musharraf seized power in 1999. His party -- Pakistan's second largest -- believes it would have won elections in 2008 had the assassination of Bhutto not given a massive boost to the ruling party. Another contender was Khan, a former cricket star and heartthrob. Not in contention is Musharraf, who returned in March from four years of self-imposed exile to take part in the elections. A court banned him from taking part in politics and his party, the All Pakistan Muslim League, announced a boycott. Musharraf and his allies weren't the only ones upset with Pakistan's leadership ahead of the election. The New York Times ""strongly protested"" the expulsion of its Islamabad bureau chief -- an order that Declan Walsh received at 12:30 a.m. local time, at his home. The Committee to Protect Journalists joined the Times in slamming the move, with its Asia program coordinator Bob Dietz saying ""it shows just how much the authorities fear independent media coverage.""

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- The one thing that Egyptians know for certain is that their next president is not a woman. That is because there are no female candidates contesting the presidential elections. All of those running for election can be classified into two categories; Islamists or Secularists. But within each camp there are distinctions and gradations. There are secularist left-wing candidates, secularist autocrats and secularist old guard. Then there are progressive Islamist, moderate Islamist, revolutionary Islamist and right-wing ones. The one thing that they all have in common is the banality of their engagement with women's rights and with questions of gender justice. Throughout the official 21 days of presidential propaganda, we the public have learned that all the candidates ""value"" women and believe that women are half of the Egyptian society and therefore should be respected and honored. A near century of Egyptian feminism and our candidates can only offer a cloyingly condescending stance on the rights of the voters who will enable one of them to become a president. This is the sad truth about Egyptian politics. It is women who attend rallies, who accept trivial bribes of sugar and rice and who stand in the very long queues to vote. Egypt segregates its polling stations, so the remarkable length of women-only queues is evident for all to see. Yet women are ignored as political agents and as citizens in all presidential programs. See also: Women and the Arab uprisings . It is true that these programs are very similar and are generally lacking but still, the projections they make of women and their rights are noteworthy. Female heads of houses feature prominently in these programs. Women living in poverty are being promised cash transfers, medical insurance and access to finance and services. Yet these women need not wait for a new president as they are already entitled to all these benefits! Our candidates have also promised women access to senior executive positions. Candidates like Amr Mousa, Abu el Fotouh, Ahmed Shafeek and Hamdeen Sabbahi have said ""there is no objection to a woman becoming ..."" then finishing the sentence by referring to positions such as vice president or some other senior function. This is also sadly a meaningless gesture since there are no legal or constitutional barriers to a woman assuming high office in any branch of the executive, legislature or now the judiciary. Our candidates are promising to solve the problems that already have solutions, but what about the ones that don't? What about to the proliferation of gender discrimination? What about their position on repeated attempts to repeal family-status laws that gave women the right to unilateral divorce, which enabled women to keep custody and guardianship of their children until the age of 15, instead of being deprived of their seven-year-old sons or nine-year-old daughters if they are divorced from the father? Egypt has one of the lowest rates of female labor-force participation (20%) in the world and perhaps the lowest rate of female representation in parliament (2%). Women are present, vocal, active, but excluded and undermined. The new president should have something to say about this paradox. But perhaps candidates would rather remain silent on gender issues so as to please their male supporters. See also: Revolution signals new dawn for Egypt's women . The current constitutions of Egypt guarantee equality and rights to all citizens. But the right to rights is a far cry from the attainment of these rights. Women in Egypt need a vocal champion who will not interfere with their choice of clothes, career or spouse, but who will guarantee that they have access to jobs, to legal protection, and to freedom and equality within marriage and outside it. Women are given sugar, rice and other staples so that they choose the generous candidate. They are being cajoled and gently coerced to give their voices to the candidate chosen by their family or kin. They are not, however, respected as political agents nor ""courted"" as supporters with interests and rights. What they need is a commitment, not a handout. A commitment to justice can come from a religious or a secular candidate. Women need not fear a president who ""uses"" religion to please the masses and get their votes -- nor be disappointed when the veneer of secularism cracks to reveal an ambivalent chauvinist. Whatever ""style"" choices these candidates make, they matter less than their substantive policies and positions. Women in Egypt should not hold their breath or wait for a savior but rather continue to organize and struggle for social, political and economic rights and freedoms. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hania Sholkamy.","Egypt's women ignored by presidential candidates, says Hania Sholkamy .
She says candidates haven't addressed gender discrimination .

"Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN) -- A year ago, nearly half a million protesters took to the streets across Israel in perhaps the largest social justice movement in the country's history. It all started when 25-year-old Daphni Leef pitched a tent at the end of Tel Aviv's prestigious Rothschild Boulevard after being evicted from her apartment and failing to find another she could afford in the city's pricey market. ""What happened was I went to see one apartment too many,"" said Leef. ""I was really p---ed off, and I've had it. I kind of felt like I don't want to play by these rules anymore."" She was quickly joined by hundreds of others, in what became known as Tel Aviv's tent city. In September last year, close on 500,000 people took to the streets demanding changes to the social and economic systems. A year on, Leef is living in an apartment in nearby Jaffa and the movement she became a symbol for is more muted -- but a hardy core of protesters continues to demand change. Leef, whose movement became known as J14 after its inception on July 14, 2011, is still recognized and greeted on the streets, albeit as a reluctant celebrity. She said she was inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings, and like them, started writing about her grievances through social media. ""It came from the gut, and because it came from the gut, I think people related to it,"" she said. ""I think most of the time people don't want to make the first move because it's scary, because you don't want to look like a fool."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Rita, an Israeli star singing Iranian songs . The government responded with measures it said would resolve the housing shortage and by setting up a committee to address the issues raised by the protesters. Tel Aviv mayor Ron Huldai, who has been in office since 1998, was criticized by some for what they saw as a heavy-handed police response to the protests. Huldai says the rise in the cost of housing was a sign of the city's success. ""Before people didn't find it attractive to live in Tel Aviv, now everybody wants to live here so the price of real estate goes up."" He added: ""We are in the middle of creating three projects for affordable housing in the city of Tel Aviv. We are doing lots of things we can. I'm trying to manage a very complicated situation as best as I can."" For many, however, the issues that sparked the J14 movement are still as pressing as they were a year ago. Amit Adler, a 40-year-old writer taking part in recent protests, said: ""Now we are politically matured and we understand in order to change the cost of housing and living, you must change the system."" Dani Eger, the 23-year-old organizer of a recent protest, said despite the lower turnout this year, passions run just as highly. Also on Inside the Middle East: Fears for bubble burst after Ramallah boom . ""Numbers are not the issue because many people understood that these protests on the streets are not helping because the government is not listening,"" he said. Leef too says she is not disheartened by the lower profile of this year's protests, comparing it with the year after the French student protests of May 1968. ""First of all it's like Dany le Rouge (Daniel Cohn-Bendit) from the revolution in France in '68. He says every May '68 has a May '69, so you can't go back.

"London (CNN) -- The tumultuous months since January 2011 have confronted Egyptians with uncertainty, triumph and despair on an almost daily basis. But for one Cairo-based artist, the violence, disruptions and ambiguities of the revolution have also inspired a burst of unprecedented productivity. Cairo, Year One -- Nermine Hammam's first solo show in the United Kingdom -- contains just a portion of the work she has produced in reckoning with the upheaval reshaping her country. ""Any artist, wherever they are, responds to their surroundings,"" she said. ""It just happens to be that what is happening here is a revolution."" The year following the revolution saw her produce five different bodies of work -- combining elements of photography and painting -- incorporating images from the 70,000 or so snapshots she has taken of events in Tahrir Square and the surrounding neighborhoods. ""I have never done five bodies of work over such a short period, I don't think many people have,"" she said. ""I was responding to each and every feeling I was getting, because everything is moving very quickly. One day you think there's no hope, the next you think there's a lot."" See also: Artists reflect Egypt's revolutionary spirit . Hammam initially went out every day with her camera, ""plunging"" herself into Tahrir to document the turmoil playing out around her: ""The army, the people taking care of the people on the street."" After that, she said, ""when the police were beating up people in the street,"" she turned to sourcing images of the revolution from the internet. She placed the images incongruously against utopian, postcard scenes from nature -- mountains, flowers and green fields -- or against backdrops modeled on the stylized landscapes of traditional Japanese screens. Her goal with some of the works was to ""conjure harmony"" and hope, she said. Hammam said the momentous events of the revolution were something every Egyptian artist would be drawn to address in their own way, either explicitly or implicitly. ""If other artists haven't yet, they will,"" she said. ""Even if they don't do it directly, psychologically things will change."" See also: Young upstarts plotting Mid East art revolution . But she added that it was too early to say whether the revolution would trigger a lasting artistic revival in her homeland. Hammam's work was censored under the old regime -- ""I took some pictures of the state-run mental asylum and they didn't like that,"" she said -- and she believed it remained to be seen whether there would be greater space in the new Egypt for artistic expression. ""Maybe perhaps now things will be different; maybe the idea of democracy will allow people to express how they feel,"" she said. ""But for the time being, we have no clue.""

"(CNN) -- In Syria, the Christians are angry. For eleven months, many of their leaders have stood firmly behind the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. However, Syria's new constitution explicitly says in Article 3 that the president of the country has to be a Muslim, thereby barring Christians from the right to run for the top post. On Sunday, pro-government Syrians went to the polls to approve the new constitution. In protest of Article 3, Christians voted with a ""no,"" while the opposition movement boycotted the election altogether, saying that it was inconceivable for it to take place while the country is up in flames. Nevertheless, the new constitution passed. The controversial clause in Article 3 has been around for a long time, ever since Syria established its first constitution in 1920. Both secular and Christian Syrians have over the years tried to amend the clause but to no avail. In 1973, President Hafez al-Assad released a constitutional draft that omitted reference to Islam as the official religion of the state, which enraged conservative Muslims. Faced with pressure, Assad eventually restored Article 3 to its original form. But now, as Arab Spring sweeps across the Arab world, Syria needs to rethink its old ways. What the government should realize is that it's bad politics to bar any religious group from running for presidency. If a Muslim Kurd from Qamishly has a possibility of running for the job, then why can't a Christian from Damascus? Christians make up 12% of the 23 million people in Syria. Even if a Christian has a right to run for president, it is unlikely that he will win since the majority of Syria's population which is made of 75% Sunni would never vote for a Christian. So, the Muslims should have nothing to fear and allow Christians the right to run for the office of the presidency. Moreover, Syrian Christians have until now been overwhelmingly supportive of the regime, fearing that if the regime collapses, then Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood would rise to power and focus on marginalizing the Christians. The scenarios in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Iraq and Morocco have not been encouraging. While the older generation among the Christians is more or less rallied behind the government, the younger generation is less ideological and more forward-looking. The Western-educated, Internet-savvy Christians refuse to buy the argument that says: ""It's either the Baathists, the Islamists, or chaos."" Like the young and ambitious Syrians in the broader population, they want to see a democratic transformation of the country and are confident that they will become an integral part of its future, regardless of who rises to power. The urban Christians, especially those in Damascus and Aleppo, often argue that they have been around long before the Muslims came along; and as such, they are entitled to live, work and have the right to govern the country like their countrymen. Despite the efforts of Syrian Christians, there were heavy pressures for the government to include Article 3 in the new constitution. Given the rise of Islamic zeal throughout Syria, there is fear that the public would be outraged if Christians are allowed the right to run for president. Since violence erupted last March, the government has been trying hard to appease the religious clerics who have been very influential in the anti-Assad demonstrations. Many of the clerics, needless to say, are religious dictators. The regime has tried to win over the clerics by bending to their demands, like shutting down the Damascus casino or allowing the establishment of an Islamic TV channel -- Nour al-Sham -- that contradicts everything the secular Baathists had stood for since the mid-1960s. Article 3, of course, is not the only problem with the new constitution. The power given to the presidency is enormous. Syria's government still feels that it can keep a presidential term at 7 years, renewable only once, although oppositions have demanded that the term be set at five years, renewable only once. The new constitution also gives the president the right to name a prime minister rather than vesting that authority in parliament and the right to fire a cabinet unilaterally. It still keeps the executive and legislative branches as subordinate to the president and allows him to name the head of the Supreme Judicial Council (Supreme Court). Although the flawed constitution is hailed as a great achievement by Syria's state media, many Syrians have become disenchanted, to say the least. Eleven months into the uprisings, Syrians are weary and tired. No longer do they just want an end to the one-party rule -- they now wish for real democracy, where justice, accountability and the rule of law can bring order to public life. They want a constitution that gives Muslims and Christians equal access to all jobs, including the presidency. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sami Moubayed.","In Syria, a newly approved constitution says that only Muslims can be president .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- With years of bloodshed in its recent past, Lebanon doesn't want for symbols of conflict. But if one image conjures up the country's fractious political climate better than any other, it's the burning tire. A common sight during the civil war that ravaged the country from 1975 to 1990, these impromptu roadblocks have re-appeared with regularity in the decades since, whenever flashpoints arise between Lebanon's diverse religious communities, or grievances swell up against the government or army. But an activist group in the country's Hezbollah-dominated south is reclaiming what has become a wearying symbol of division and conflict, and is recasting it as a symbol of national dialogue. In recent weeks, tires painted in bright colors have appeared in the center of the southern city of Nabatieh -- arranged not as barricades, but as coffee tables, chairs, flower pots and book shelves. ""When people first see the tires, they laugh and say 'Wow, are you planning to burn them?'"" said Layla Serhan, one of the organizers of the project, through a translator. ""But then they would sit and talk, and ask us to do more all over the town. Because we don't need more burning -- we need something beautiful, something that brings happiness."" Serhan is the president of the Youth Network for Civic Activism (YNCA), a group formed four years ago to engage young people struggling with life after the 2006 conflict with Israel. The 34-days of fighting left between 850 to 1,190 Lebanese civilians and combatants dead, particularly affecting the southern parts of the country dominated by Hezbollah. Regarded by the United States and Israel as a terrorist organization, the Shiite militant group holds power in the Lebanese government and operates social services such as schools and hospitals. Serhan said the conflict had badly affected the young people of Nabatieh, a Shiite town of about 120,000 people, situated some 60 kilometers from the Israeli border. ""They behaved in a strange way. They were behaving like they are heroes. At the same time they were very sad because their brothers and neighbors were killed, but they wouldn't show it."" The young people were traumatized, but there was ""no space"" in the militarized post-war society for them to express their fears, anxieties or creativity, she said. ""It was very difficult dealing with youth. They didn't discuss issues, they were just aggressive: 'You are with me or against me'."" Read also: Lebanon's missing history . With limited employment opportunities, and outlets such as arts and entertainment non-existent in the prevailing religious climate, young people increasingly drifted towards drugs or sectarianism, she said. ""The youth didn't have many alternatives,"" said Serhan. ""No cinemas, no youth clubs. So they went to parties or they spent their time on the streets doing nothing, just smoking a hookah."" Hamsa Abo Zeid is a 21-year-old university student who has been involved with YNCA for four years. ""We were a group of youth looking for a safe space to spend our spare time -- especially after the war of 2006, where everything in Nabatieh (seemed) insecure for us,"" she explained. ""We hadn't any space to live the way we liked, due to the bad political, social and economical situation; we encountered a lot of taboos and we didn't see any horizons for our future."" Since then, YNCA has run programs to teach people conflict resolution, political engagement and leadership skills, all with a creative focus. Typical of their approach was an interactive street theater performance, in which YNCA actors set up a souk, or market, and offered to sell passersby drugs, their votes, their bodies. The message, explained YNCA's executive manager Dany Kalakech: ""You can buy drugs, but the price is your future. You can buy election votes, but you have to pay with your honesty."" The group has held outdoor cinema clubs, workshops with members of the national soccer team, and encouraged participants to express themselves through music, dance and theater, with some going on to careers as performers. ""The most important thing is that we learned how to create new ways to express ourselves and our opinion freely, and to send our advocacy messages to public, especially through art,"" said Abo Zeid. The tire project was motivated by recent sectarian unrest in parts of the country, following the shooting of a Sunni cleric by the army.

The religious parties don't want us to do them -- they're afraid that we will attract the youth, and they want the youth for themselves."" He said incidents where the YNCA had been targeted included a man threatening to smash the projector at an outdoor film screening, vandalism of the organization's office, and a false allegation made to police that its leaders were working without proper documentation. Kalakech said the fact the group had received USAID funding had led to gossip ""that we are working against our people for the U.S. Department of State -- which is not true."" Nevertheless the threats were enough to make some participants drop out of YNCA activities. In response, the organization had learned ""to be smart,"" said Kalakech. Last year, YNCA partnered with a number of like-minded organizations to declare a ""week of joy"" in the town to celebrate the marriage of a young couple. The occasion provided cover to distribute pamphlets and posters with the group's messages, but more importantly, to break recent prohibitions against dancing and singing in the streets. ""When we danced, people came from all over the city to dance with us, to watch from the balconies,"" said Kalakech. The benefit of the exercise? ""To break the fear,"" said Serhan.

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles police have posted the images of 42 women culled from the photo collection of the ""Grim Sleeper"" serial murder suspect on social media and the department website, officials announced Thursday. The photographs were taken between 1976 and 2010, and the women in them have yet to be identified, police said in a news release. If anyone recognizes one of the women, they can use Twitter (https://twitter.com/LAPDGrimSleeper) or Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/pages/LAPD-Grim-Sleeper/269881769790597?fref=ts) to make a positive identification. The number to make an anonymous tip is 800-222-8477. Lonnie David Franklin Jr., who was arrested in July 2010, is accused of killing women ranging from ages 14 to 36 between August 1985 and January 2007. Many of the victims were prostitutes, authorities have said in the past. Most of the sleeper's victims were discovered dumped in south Los Angeles alleys and covered with debris, authorities said. All victims were shot; some were strangled too, an indictment alleges. Authorities widened their inquiry to include all homicides that occurred in a general area of south Los Angeles where Franklin lived from the 1970s, when he got out of the military, through the 1980s, police spokeswoman Karen Rayner said in August 2011. That amounts to about 230 murders, and even some that officials thought had been solved, she said. Franklin, 59, has pleaded not guilty to 10 charges of murder and one of attempted murder. Prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty against Franklin. Before his arrest, Franklin had worked for a time as a garage attendant at a Los Angeles police station, authorities said. The killer was nicknamed the Grim Sleeper because he seemed to take long breaks between homicides, police said.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Taliban claimed responsibility for Tuesday's suicide blast outside the Afghan Supreme Court, a brazen attack in the heart of Kabul that killed 17 people and wounded 39. Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said in a statement e-mailed to media that government judges are oppressing and mistreating people in several parts of the country. The blast, which occurred near the U.S. Embassy on Tuesday afternoon, comes amid the Taliban's spring offensive against Afghan government and coalition targets. A bomber in a Toyota Corolla targeted a convoy of minibuses on their way out of the court compound to drop off staffers at their homes, said Hashmat Stanikzai, a spokesman for the city's police chief. Deputy Police Chief Dawood Amin said two women and three children were among the 17 people slain. Eight women were among those injured, Amin said. The Taliban statement said the militants had been following Supreme Court judges and high-ranking staff members for a long time before they launched the attack. NATO's International Security Assistance Force condemned the attack. ""Once again the enemies of Afghanistan have demonstrated a complete lack of respect for human life,"" said Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, the ISAF commander. ""The targeting of hard working Afghans on their way home from work is reprehensible."" The bomb detonated near Masoud Circle and ""was designed to cause the maximum number of civilian casualties,"" the ISAF said. ""There's no other way to explain it. The extremists deliberately detonated a powerful bomb among a crowd of innocent Afghan civilians,"" Dunford said. Insurgents have carried out many attacks across the country this spring. So far, at least 18 coalition soldiers have died in June. 2 children beheaded by militants, Afghan authorities say . Reports surfaced Monday of Taliban militants beheading two children in Kandahar province, acts that the militant group has denied. On Monday, Taliban fighters armed with guns and explosives clashed with security forces after taking over a building near the airport in Kabul, the Afghan capital. The fighting ended with all seven attackers dead, Afghan officials said. Last month, a suicide car bombing on a coalition convoy in central Kabul killed at least 12 people, six of them American and six Afghan. The insurgent group Hezb-e Islami claimed responsibility for that attack. The group is not under the Taliban leadership, but operates alongside them.","NEW: NATO's International Security Assistance Force condemns the attack .

"(CNN) -- With horrors emerging from Syria's civil war with numbing regularity, it can be easy to lose sight of the fact that the uprising has not been waged only with guns. A creative and resolutely non-violent form of opposition to Bashar al-Assad's regime has taken hold in Syria, as the country's artists respond to the crisis with newfound boldness and purpose, despite the clear dangers in doing so. ""Since the uprising, the artists have broken through the wall of fear in Syria and are thinking in another way,"" said Syrian journalist Aram Tahhan, one of the curators of an exhibition on Syria's creative dissent -- Culture in Defiance -- currently on display in Amsterdam. ""The uprising has changed the artists' thinking about the task of art in society, how they can do something useful for society,"" said Tahhan. ""They have rewritten everything."" With works spanning from painting to song to cartoons, puppet theater to graffiti to plays, the exhibition traces the way that Syrian artists have used a range of creative techniques within traditional and new media to create political, populist art that that both brooks ""the red line"" of dissent and engages the public in unprecedented ways. The regime is well aware of the power of visual images and art to mobilize public opinion, says Tahhan. After all, the uprising began when schoolchildren in Daraa were arrested for painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of a school last year. ""From the beginning the regime has known it's dangerous to use the image, to use art,"" said Tahhan. ""The camera is the equal of any weapon from the point of view of the regime."" A dangerous calling . All of which has made producing political art dangerous, sometimes mortally so. Ibrahim Qashoush, a fireman and part-time poet from Hama, wrote popular anti-Assad songs that were sung demonstrations, most notably a number called ""Time to Leave."" Last July, his body was found dumped in a river with his throat cut out, vocal cords removed. A pen-and-ink portrait of the mutilated singer by artist Khalil Younes is featured in the exhibition, while Qashoush's song is played in a section the curators call the ""Revolutionary Hit Parade."" Read also: Images of Tahrir -- Egypt's revolutionary art . The regime's brutality has struck more established artists as well. The distinguished political cartoonist Ali Ferzat had his first piece published in a newspaper when he was 12, produced a daily editorial cartoon for the official newspaper throughout the 1970s, and had direct contact with Bashar al-Assad throughout the early days of his presidency. ""I remember when he first walked into my exhibition at a cultural centre -- a tall dude with a large entourage. He asked me how he could access what the people were thinking and I told him to just talk to them,"" Ferzat said, in an interview printed in the exhibition's catalog. Ferzat's cartoons had typically used symbols, and rarely depicted identifiable political figures. But three months before the uprising began, hoping to inspire others, he resolved to take a more strident approach. Writing a call to arms on his website -- ""We have to break the barrier of fear that is 50 years old"" -- he began drawing senior regime figures, before breaking the final taboo by depicting Assad himself. ""It was a decision that took a lot of guts, but I felt it was time. No one could take their corruption anymore,"" he said. In August 2011, he said he was abducted by gunmen and brutally assaulted, his attackers focusing their violence on his hands. Ferzat has left the Syria to recuperate, but like many others in his position, has vowed to continue working and to return to his country. ""I just started drawing after healing,"" he said. ""After I was assaulted and my hands were broken, someone asked me: Could I still find the courage to draw? I told them I had been ashamed by the suffering of 13-year-old Hamza al-Khateeb. I am humbled by the culture and heart of people who cannot draw or write but who are sacrificing their lives for freedom."" A technological revolution . Not only are the artists of the Syrian uprising expressing political views more boldly than before, but they are employing new technologies to bring those works to a broader audience, engaging the public with art in an unprecedented way. Before the uprising, said Tahhan, art tended to be the preserve of only a relatively small circle of urban Syrians. ""But since, we have had a new kind of cultural production -- new songs, new theater, new cinema, new posters that make links between the artistic and the ordinary life of the people. Most of artists are concerned with what happens in the street: Checkpoints, the daily life of the people under tough conditions."" Read also: Tourists take Islamic ""pray-cations"" Syria has poor internet infrastructure -- although this is changing slowly -- while censors have typically been wary of social media sites, according to press freedom organization, Reporters Without Borders. But under Bashar al-Assad, the regime had been increasing its visibility on the web. In February 2011, shortly before the uprising began, Facebook was unblocked, and before that al-Assad and First Lady, Asma had their own pages on the site. According to Tahhan, Facebook and social media sites like it provided activists with a powerful medium for distributing subversive images. One piece of resistance art which has thrived on the internet, gaining hundreds of thousands of views online, is the daring satirical puppet show Top Goon: Diaries of a Little Dictator, created by the 10-member artists' collective Masasit Mati. The leader of group -- drawn from theater, art, film-making and journalism backgrounds -- said he settled on finger puppets for their depiction of Assad and his regime because they were easy to smuggle through checkpoints, and because doing so removed the ""godlike aura"" around Assad. ""He's a puppet; you can carry him in your hand,"" the group's anonymous director, Jameel, told curators. ""You can break him. You can actually deal with everything that is scary with laughter."" Syrians have begun referring to Assad using the name of Top Goon's diminutive dictator, Beeshu, he added. ""It's peaceful, effective protest."" Syria explained: What you need to know . Documentary through art . For other artists, their work has also played an important role in documenting a conflict that has largely been shielded from the world's media by the regime. Khalil Younes, the painter, illustrator and video artist behind the portrait of Qashoush, believes the relative absence of journalists in Syria makes it incumbent on artists to capture the unfolding events. ""We saw hundreds of thousands of professionally taken photographs of the Egyptian revolution,"" he told curators. ""As artists, we should make something that not only reflects on the (Syrian) revolution right now, but make something that will last two generations from now."" The uprising ""isn't just a people standing up to their government, to the regime; it is a revolution with many aspects: An artistic revolution and a social one as well,"" he said. ""Significantly, you can see people trying to introduce sensitive ideas to the public; and it seems they are receptive, which itself is a sign of social change."" Christa Meindersma is the director of the Prince Claus Fund, the Dutch culture funding body behind the exhibition. She said the exhibition, which runs at the Prince Claus Fund Gallery until late November and is curated by Malu Halasa, Tahhan, Leen Zyiad and Donatella Della Ratta, was attracting interest from galleries around the world wanting to represent Syrian artists. The exhibition ""really gives a different picture to what is going on, in addition to what we see on television,"" she said. ""Which is of course also a reality, but this is a reality -- a very important one."" Attendees are often surprised by the diversity of the work being produced, and by the humorous, subversive tone of many artists, she said. ""It is very difficult for civilian artists and activists right now who want to work non-violently while there is so much violence going on,"" she added. ""Yet there's a large dose of humor, notwithstanding the situation. They say they have moved beyond fear.""

"(CNN) -- Nollywood, Nigeria's booming film industry, has grown in recent years into a mighty movie-making machine, capturing audiences with its universal themes and strong narratives of urban culture. The mega industry, one of Nigeria's biggest employers, has been notorious for churning out more than 1,000 typically low-budget films a year, fusing a wide array of stories ranging from romance and drama to comedy and witchcraft. It is currently the third-largest producer of feature films in world, ranking behind only Hollywood in the U.S. and India's Bollywood revenue. Read related: 'Netflix of Africa' brings Nollywood to world . And lately, instead of relying on shoe-string budgets, many Nollywood movies are attracting funding of a few million dollars, benefiting from the films' growing popularity. But while the industry gets bigger, insiders say Nollywood has remained true to its recipe for success -- its connection with the audience. Nigerian director Lancelot Imasuen, who is currently working on a $2 million film called ""Invasion 1987,"" says Nollywood movies are made for Nigerians and the rest of the continent. ""People get in touch with [Nollywood's] direct realism,"" says Imasuen. ""People are getting more and more interested, more and more involved in our productions because they can feel the pains, they can feel the excitement, it's so real to them."" Read more: Nigerian blockbusters for the internet generation . Imasuen, a pioneering filmmaker with more than 10 years of experience, says that Nollywood's themes strike a familiar chord with the audience making them feel part of the stories. And that, he says, is the industry's big advantage compared to the competition posed by Hollywood productions. ""For us in Africa, we just get entertained by American films,"" says Imasuen. ""When I'm watching Spiderman or Batman and all that, its just for spectacle. I'm just having fun because I know its not realistic for the guy just to fly here and there -- there is nothing that relates to us as individuals."" Read more: 'New Nigeria Cinema' sparks Nollywood renaissance . Known in Nollywood's circles as ""The Governor,"" Imasuen is one of the most sought after names in Nigerian filmmaking -- he once directed 29 movies in just one year, 27 of which were big hits. ""That's my job, that's the never say die spirit of the Nigerian man,"" he explains. ""If you can't get it this way, you have to do it this way and so I tried to do right. And for me that was a great challenge and when you're good at what you're doing, there is a tendency that people call you to do more,"" adds Imasuen. Read more: Exhibition shows off the art of Nollywood . ""And before you know it, you don't have time to even lie on your bed for 30 days or 365 days of the year."" In fact, it is the hard work and dedication of people like Imasuen that have helped Nollywood to grow and become a thriving industry in the last two decades . ""If you spend any time in Nigeria, it is difficult to come across a person who hasn't heard of Nollywood,"" says Jason Njoku, founder of iROKO Partners, an internet company that distributes Nollywood films to online viewers across the world. ""But at the same time, the pan-African nature of it -- from the Kenyans to the Ghanaians to Gambians to people in the DRC -- there's a massive base of people who really love this content."" The thriving industry is constantly attracting new talents -- aspiring film stars looking to follow in the steps of already established Nollywood names. Read more: Genevieve Nnaji: Nollywood's Julia Roberts . One up-and-coming actress is Uru Eke, a newer face in Nollywood who has followed an unconventional path to stardom. Born in the UK, Eke went to university and began a career in information technology that lasted for five years before deciding to pursue her lifelong dream of becoming an actress in Nigeria. Eke, who is among the stars of Nollywood's latest hit movie ""Last flight to Abuja,"" says her goal is to become one of the top names in the industry. ""I'm working hard and I'm very hopeful, it's just the positive attitude and the strength that I have to get there,"" she says. ""Nigeria is by no means the easiest place to start a business or a career, but I think it's the tenacity, the spirit to succeed despite the odds, that can always drive you to reach your goal, actualize your dream. So with that spirit that I have, I know the sky's my limit."" Going forward, Imasuen says that raising funds to develop story ideas and train new talents is still one of Nollywood's biggest challenges. ""The intellect, the inspiration, the creativity, they all abound, but the truth of the matter is the challenges almost exceeds the goodness,"" he says. But despite all the difficulties, Imasuen says that he and his peers will continue doing what they love in order to help Nollywood grow even further. ""We've been able to build a profile over the years,"" he says. ""We're ready for the change, we're ready for the time and we still want to maintain the Nigerian way of making film, but globalizing it.""","Nollywood produces more than 1,000 movies a year .

"(CNN) -- A car bomb targeting the headquarters of Syria's ruling party killed 53 people in central Damascus on Thursday, opposition activists and state-run media said. The explosion was close to a Russian Embassy building complex. No one there was injured or killed, but there was damage to a building, Russia's Foreign Ministry said. Most of the victims were civilians. It's unclear who is behind the blast. The explosion wounded more than 230 more people and burned 17 cars, Syrian state TV said. Ambulances raced to the scene as body bags were brought for the charred remains of passengers in a taxi, according to state television. The bomb detonated at a checkpoint manned by government soldiers in front of the Baath Socialist Party's main office, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The neighborhood is also home to Iraqi refugees as well as Druze and Christian groups. Syrian rebels issue warning to Hezbollah . It was unclear whether the driver blew up the car while sitting inside it or parked the vehicle and left before setting it off. The main Syrian opposition, the National Coalition for the Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, posted a statement on Facebook saying President Bashar al-Assad's government was guilty of shelling residential neighborhoods and other crimes. The ""terrorist Assad regime"" wishes to push Syrians ""to the brink of despair,"" it said. The car bomb exploded just 65 feet away from the Baath Party building and damaged it, a resident named Mohammed said. Two schools are close by, and teachers phoned parents, asking them to pick up their children, he said. He did not want to give his last name because he was concerned for his own safety. There was damage as far away as 1,000 feet (305 meters), the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. In a separate incident, two car bombs exploded at government checkpoints in the Damascus suburb of Barzeh. Clashes ensued after the explosions, the Observatory said. In addition, two mortar rounds struck the Damascus offices of the Syrian army's leadership, the opposition reported. In early January, a car bomb demolished a gas station close to a hospital in Barzeh, killing civilians. The government and opposition groups blamed each other for the attack. Activists detail abuse inside al-Assad's prisons . Over the past year, rebels fighting to topple al-Assad's government have made inroads in the Damascus suburbs and have conducted potent strikes against government targets in the capital. Syrian government forces continued heavy aerial bombardments over rebel strongholds Thursday. Multiple attacks targeted towns in Idlib province in the north and in Daraa province bordering Israel, Jordan and Lebanon. The United Nations says that about 70,000 people have been killed in Syria's civil war, which began nearly two years ago.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- It's been a long time since the Bay Area's cuisine was defined by sourdough and Rice-A-Roni. Ever since Alice Waters' renowned restaurant Chez Panisse opened in Berkeley and ushered in the local food revolution, the region has become home to a growing tribe of foodies, locavores, chef groupies and ecstatic eaters that I call ""foodhemians."" They don't just just worship food here, they raise grass-fed golden calves, humanely slaughter them and serve them with a side of precious. There are a million reasons why food is big in the Bay. Here are three: 1. The high concentration of wealthy, health-conscious people. 2. A long tradition of epicureanism rooted in San Francisco's identity as a port town. But the big one is 3. Location. Northern California is a land of abundance from its wide variety of fruits and vegetables, courtesy of the Mediterranean climate, to its dungeness crabs crawling on the ocean floor. Now imagine if the foodhemians discovered that all of those foodstuffs were free. That all they need to do is know where to look. They have. Foraging is all the rage in the Bay these days. Part of foraging's appeal is its elegance: Find wild things that you can eat, collect them and put them in your stomach. But things like private property, naturally occurring poisons and pollutants complicate what in theory is a simple project. So a paradox was born: organizations that help you get wild. Found Fruit and Forage Oakland are two groups that offer foraging-related events. What's wrong with Stockholm . The 60-year-old Mycological Society of San Francisco (read: ""mushroom people"") meets monthly and organizes occasional walks, but the most comprehensive foraging group in the Bay is ForageSF. Of course, you can also just buy a plant identification book and take a walk. I decided to spend $40 and go on a sea forage with Kirk Lombard, fisherman and raconteur. His sea foraging tour, offered through ForageSF, was recently named ""Best Walking Tour"" in San Francisco. (He also offers variations on the foraging tour that you can learn about at his website.) Kirk is a former catch monitor for the California Department of Fish and Game, and, as my girlfriend pointed out, the only person under 70 who can wear a small brown fedora without looking like a tool. Kirk is a commercial fisherman by trade, but he also teaches landlubbers how to identify edible seaweeds, find shellfish and catch sea creatures without a rod and reel. ""Everyone says the Bay is dead, the result of urban apocalypse and that's bulls**t,"" says Kirk while shoving squid into a little contraption that he'll use to catch crabs. We are standing on St. Francis Jetty looking out at the Golden Gate Bridge and the sun has not yet overtaken the moon in the sky. Kirk's an entertainer as well as a fisherman. His grandparents and parents were vaudevillians and actors on Broadway, but Kirk's shtick -- and it is a bit of a shtick -- is the ocean. Specifically, extracting creatures from it without a boat. His signature fishing method involves poking around for fish with a pole that has a six-inch line and a baited hook at the end. A practice that's aptly named ""poke poling."" ""One day I was casting into the water all day and getting nothing. I'd lost 60 bucks of tackle and was utterly defeated when I saw this guy walk by with a pole and bucket overflowing with fish. I thought 'no freaking way,' Kirk said. ""I asked him what his secret was and he said 'Everyone fishes out there,' pointing to the water, 'but the fish are right here,' pointing to the rocky coast."" Istria is not the new Tuscany . The guy called himself 'Cambodian Stan.' He let Kirk follow him for three days until he got the swing of things. Now the poke pole is a permanent part of Kirk's repertoire. The rest of his repertoire revolves around his encyclopedic knowledge of the creatures that live in and around the Bay. The goose barnacles, the mussels, the crabs, the rockfish. The herring, the salmon, the sardines, the eel. Especially the eel. Kirk holds the California state record for catching the largest monkey-faced eel. We had our backs turned to the city the entire tour. Which was kind of the point. San Francisco's vast cultural and architectural riches can sometimes reduce the Bay to blue embroidery around the bottom of a window, but the sea-foraging expedition reasserts the water to its rightful place at the center of things. Which, ultimately, might be the biggest benefit of Kirk's tour. Because the truth is, it's not advisable to eat anything caught east of the Golden Gate bridge. The water is too polluted. Kirk's methods are intended to be applied mostly up north in Marin County or south of San Francisco in Half Moon Bay. If a traveler really wants to eat fresh-caught fish and foraged goodies in San Francisco, the best place to go is one of ForageSF's wild foods dinners. Founded in 2008 by Iso Rabins, a young bearded guy whose knack for identifying wild foodstuffs is matched only by his knack for entrepreneurship, ForageSF calls itself a ""wild foods community,"" which means they don't just gather and distribute wild foods, they also teach classes, hold market events and host wild kitchen dinners -- a roving monthly dinner party that pops up on boats and lofts around the city. Unlike a mushroom in the woods, ForageSF activities aren't free. Wild food walks are $30 and the underground meals are $90 a person, although they do reserve $40 seats for those who can't afford to pay full price. The dinner I attended was held on the top floor of a nondescript building in San Francisco's part-trendy, part-sketchy SOMA neighborhood. A lone woman stood at the entrance discreetly taking tickets. As my girlfriend and I made our way up the stairs, we could hear the clink and laughter hum of revelry. The questionable legality of these gatherings gives them a mischievous charge as do the nontraditional settings. When we finally arrived on our floor and turned the corner we found ourselves in a room the size of a city block with two tables filled with 40 people each and an exposed clawfoot tub replete with functional plumbing and a guitar pick of soap resting on the drain. The crowd wasn't just the beards and tasteful tattoos you might expect. There were Dockers and dresses. High heels and sneakers. Wrinkles and pimples. The woman across from me worked at a bank. The woman sitting to my left was a grade school principal from a small town an hour south. Our volunteer waitress was a scientist. Here are the things we put in our stomachs: wild porcini escargot, braised octopus with wild nettle salsa verde, wild boar scotch quail egg with champagne frisÃ©e, black cod with morel duxelles and wild New Zealand spinach, wild nettle and heirloom tomato tart, summer bean and fingerling potato salad with wild grape verjus, lemon curd with wild elderberry cream and fennel pollen sugar. That's a lot of wild. It was delicious. It sounds pretentious. But when you learn that the escargot were found in yards around San Francisco and that the New Zealand spinach grows wild everywhere and that the morels, mushrooms and grapes were picked for free, and that the fish was line caught nearby and the boar was hunted and killed in the wild by the chef, even the skeptics have to admit it's a pretty neat feat no matter how much words like ""verjus"" (still don't know what it means) get your (factory-farmed) goat. Oh, and everything was local, organic and sustainable, but that's beside the point, even if, for some, it was the point. By the end of the meal the room was rumbling with pleasure. Wine was shared. Chatter chatted. It was exactly the sort of thing you think you're missing out on when you read about San Francisco and you're not there. At this point in the night my notes got wobbly. The last thing I wrote down was, ""'Blue Moon' is playing. Old people next to me smiling, obviously in love. Yes, America's economy is in trouble, but yes America is amazing.""","Foraging for local food is gaining popularity in San Francisco .

"(CNN) -- The Achilles heel of America's policy against terrorism is its failure to counter the narratives that inspire individuals to become extremists and terrorists. That's why -- despite the skill and numerous successes of our military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies -- the type of tragic events seen most recently with the stabbings of soldiers in London and outside Paris, and the April bombing of the Boston Marathon, will continue to occur. We're failing to use a key weapon that needs to be used. There's no question that the United States has been extremely effective tactically against al Qaeda and other terrorist groups since 9/11. Our military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies have done what they were charged with doing, from routing them in Afghanistan to hunting down Osama bin Laden to thwarting plots against New York. But this isn't enough. For as long as extremists are able to attract new recruits, they'll keep producing replacements for those killed or apprehended and the battle will never end. This is why the strategic tool known as ""countering violent extremism,"" or CVE, has to be used alongside special operations, drones and other weapons. As an FBI Special Agent, I interrogated dozens of senior terrorists. It quickly became clear that part of al Qaeda's effectiveness in gaining recruits was in their tailoring their rhetoric and their messenger to the personality, location and likely local grievances of their target. Extremists won't use a Yemeni railing about U.S. ""crimes"" in Iraq to try to appeal to American-Somali youths in Minnesota. They'll find someone with as close a background as possible, and who understands grievances that resonate, such as foreign powers intervening in Somalia's affairs. Once a person is recruited they are indoctrinated with the group's counterculture. Asymmetrical groups like al Qaeda often develop their own countercultures, with certain religious texts, events and a consciousness that allows them to in many ways create their own religion within Islam. It isn't an ideology. That's factually inaccurate and gives it undeserved credit. It's a false narrative. As I travel around the world today, I've seen how that counterculture, once centered in Afghanistan and Pakistan, has worryingly spread to places like Nigeria and Southeast Asia. Its spread is helped by today's new technological tools: Recruitment is not just happening in training camps and in secret meeting rooms, but in Internet chat rooms and through social media. That has been a major factor in the increase in homegrown terrorism in the West, seen horrifically on May 22 on the streets of London and April 15 at the Boston Marathon. In his recent speech on terrorism, President Obama told the nation that the values the United States holds will ultimately defeat the terrorists. This will be the case as long as we take the steps to effectively deploy our message. We need to counter extremists in the same manner that they recruit: Targeting extremists with the ideal medium, messenger and message. A mistake the United States has been making to date is in repeatedly making broad gestures toward the Muslim world and the U.S. Muslim community, making the argument that the United States is a friend. These broad messages don't have an impact on those who need to be targeted. The United States is working on developing a CVE program, but it has mistakenly spread the domestic portfolio across a range of agencies, from the Department of Education to the FBI. This makes it difficult to have a clear and effective strategy, and also hampers efforts: Charging law enforcement with both collecting intelligence on suspected extremists as well as handling community engagement programs creates natural conflicts and means that neither job can be done effectively. The ideal situation is one in which the federal government provides support to local efforts to deal with local extremists and recruitment factors, not by imposing a strategy dictated from Washington. This requires local communities -- whether in New York or in Sana'a, Yemen -- to step up and take the lead in increasing the resiliency of their communities against these groups by identifying what the extremist narratives are and where they're spreading -- and then by countering them. When people are being recruited because of alleged local or tribal grievances, it is community leaders who are the best messengers to counter that narrative. When it's a distortion of Islam, it's the duty of religious leaders to take the lead. Sometimes it's former extremists, who have taken the same path and have credibility, who can be the most effective messengers. The best CVE programs, such as Singapore's, do this. They have a focused aim of reducing the pool of potential recruits and the appeal of violence, and they target accordingly. When done correctly, CVE should not be an excuse for broad social work or for anthropological studies; it's a focused counterterrorism weapon.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Tensions between Hong Kong residents and visitors from mainland China ratcheted up Wednesday, after a full-page advertisement decrying a so-called invasion of ""locusts"" from across the border appeared in a local newspaper. The advertisement in the Apple Daily asks if Hong Kongers approve of spending HK$1,000,000 (US$128,925) every 18 minutes to take care of children borne by mainland parents and declares that ""Hong Kong people have had enough!"" Picturing a giant locust perched atop a mountain overlooking Hong Kong, the ad invokes the locally-coined locust label used to describe mainlanders, reflecting a concern among some residents in Hong Kong that mainland Chinese are ""taking over"" the city. A surge in the number of pregnant Chinese women crossing into Hong Kong to give birth has put a growing burden on the resources of local hospitals. According to the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, the number of live births in Hong Kong by mainland mothers went from 26,838 in 2006 to 40,875 in 2010 -- a 52% increase. On Tuesday, Hong Kong Hospital Authority official said in a radio interview that public hospitals may ban mainland mothers to ensure that local pregnant women can be accommodated. This follows a decision last year by Hong Kong Secretary for Food and Health, York Chow, to cap the number of non-local women giving birth in the city in 2012 at 35,000. In addition to the perception of better medical services, many mainland women choose to give birth in Hong Kong so their children can gain the right of abode and other privileges conferred by a Hong Kong identity card. Of the 41.9 million visitors to Hong Kong in 2011, the majority -- more than 28 million -- hailed from mainland China, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. Wednesday's advert was organized by internet users, who raised more than US$12,000 within a week, according to the South China Morning Post. ""[Mainlanders] have already crossed our bottom line,"" organizer Yung Jhon, told the Post. ""Why are mainland mothers flooding in to take up resources in public hospitals, getting our benefits and social welfare? Why do mainlanders ... refuse to follow our rules and order? We can't accept that."" The ad comes after a series of incidents in recent weeks that point to a growing resentment among locals, with some critics suggesting this is due to a deeper unease and anxiety over Beijing's degree of influence in local affairs and Hong Kong's autonomy within the ""one country, two systems"" that took effect after the city's handover to Beijing in 1997. ""The greatest fear Hong Kong people have is Hong Kong becoming just one more city in China,"" Chinese University of Hong Kong anthropologist Gordon Mathews told Time magazine last week. In December, a row between locals and mainland visitors on a city train was caught on video and widely circulated online. The prolonged yelling match, sparked when an local man became incensed by a woman who had disobeyed the no-eating rules and ended up spilling food on seats, led passengers to press the emergency button. Another incident occurred last month outside a Dolce & Gabbana store in Hong Kong when shop staff were accused of discriminating against locals by preventing them from taking pictures, while mainland tourists and other foreigners were reportedly allowed to do so. In China, reaction to the newspaper ad on micro-blogging site Sina Weibo ranged from indignation from sadness. ""If you are independent enough, then don't use resources from the mainland!"" wrote a user named lan-tong. @pqdexiaoxi pointed out that Hong Kongers have provided the mainland with flood disaster relief several times over the past decades. ""I believe many mainlanders are very grateful, but the advertisement hurts our feelings."" @bingjilinjiezhi said: ""As parents, we all hope to find better living conditions for our children. Why should that be criticized?""","Hong Kong residents fund newspaper ad against influx of pregnant mainland Chinese women .

"(CNN) -- ""Happy Birthday: You're fired!"" No, that's not the catch phrase from a new reality show hosted by Donald Trump. It's worse than that -- assuming there could be something worse than a new Donald Trump reality show. This statement is in essence what many Americans around the country hear each day because of legally mandated retirement age. Even though you may have been an outstanding worker the day before, because you are now one day older and have reached the retirement age limit, you are tossed in the waste bin. Just so it's clear, age discrimination in most fields is prohibited by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act passed by Congress in 1967. This law protects workers between 40 and 70 from age discrimination. The law was amended in 1986 to expand protections to workers over 70 years old. Fittingly, this extension was signed into law by then 75-year-old President Ronald Reagan, who remarked: ""We take another important step by ensuring that the many individuals 70 years of age and older, who have valuable contributions to make, will now have the opportunity to do so."" The problem is that this law provides numerous exceptions that result in legally sanctioned age discrimination in various professions. For example, federal air traffic controllers cannot be older than 30 when starting their employment and must retire by 56. FBI agents can say, ""Freeze FBI!"" up until they are 57 years old. But then they have to turn in their FBI windbreaker. (The FBI director can extend an agent's service a few more years depending on circumstances.) Airline pilots must leave the cockpit and became permanent passengers at 65 years of age. National Park rangers must retire at 57. And numerous state and local governments are able to mandate that firefighters and police officers be sent off to pasture at a certain age. Sure, some of these professions involve a standard in physical competency, which was the rationale for the age limit. But every 57-year-old isn't the same. Nor is every 77-year-old. As opposed to blanket firings based on age, testing can easily be implemented to ensure that each individual is still capable of executing the tasks required of the job. Mandatory age restrictions are not just limited to occupations that have a physical component. Judges in 33 states are required by law to retire between 70 and 75 years of age. A judge doesn't do much physically -- they put on a robe, walk to the bench, strike the gavel a few times -- done. Sure, every now and then they raise their voice when angry at a lawyer- being a former lawyer I can attest to being on the receiving end of their barbs -- but not much more. For judges it's all about mental fitness. The good news is that 10 states are currently considering raising the mandatory retirement age, including New York where the issue is being discussed in the state's legislature this week. Thankfully, life expectancy in the United States is an ever-improving proposition. It is now up to 78 years old, an increase of approximately eight years since the 1960s. If you want to see how long the U.S. government thinks you will live to the exact month, check out the creepy life expectancy calculator on the Social Security Administration's website. A recent poll found that most Americans are delaying their retirement. It is now up to 61 from 57 years old in the 1990s. And non-retired workers plan to retire at 66, up from 60 in 1995. Certainly, this can be attributed to the fact that some don't have the funds needed to retire earlier. But for many, it's that they are physically and mentally adept enough to keep working. I'm sure there are some people who love their jobs and want to work as long as possible. Why shouldn't older Americans be able to work as long as they choose to as long as they are physically and mentally fit enough? Legally mandated retirement ages don't make sense from a business point of view either. Why wouldn't employers want to retain older employees who have rich experiences and skills that are assets? The concept that a person should be let go solely because of age is just as wrong as discrimination based on race, gender or ethnicity. Plus, legally sanctioned age discrimination sends a horrible message that older workers are inherently less valuable than younger ones. Changing perceptions about older workers will take time, but a great step forward would be for Congress to amend the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to make it clear that age discrimination in all professions will no longer be tolerated in the United States of America. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Each day, people hear the catch phrase, ""Happy Birthday: You're fired!""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Soap opera actor Dylan Michael Patton faces a judge Thursday on charges he sold cocaine out of his Los Angeles home. Patton, 20, played Will Horton for a year on NBC's ""Days of Our Lives, according to his Internet Movie Database biography. Since Patton's Agora Hills home is next to Sumac Elementary School, he is charged with selling drugs within 1,000 feet of an elementary school, the criminal complaint said. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested Patton at his home, which they then searched, according to the Los Angeles district attorney's office. ""Deputies allegedly seized cocaine from the residence,"" the release said. Prosecutors said they will ask Patton's bail be set at $30,000. He would face up to nine years in prison if convicted. Patton was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for outstanding young actor in a drama series in 2010, according to his official biography. His role on the daytime soap lasted from February 2009 until January 2010, according to IMBD.com. A native of Texas, Patton began his professional acting career at age 7 with regional and national commercials, his official biography said.

"(CNN) -- American technology pioneer John McAfee said he faked a heart attack while detained in Guatemala to buy time for his attorney to file a series of appeals that ultimately prevented his deportation to Belize, hastening the government's decision to send him back to the United States. After weeks on the run and days in immigration detention, McAfee arrived in Miami on Wednesday. He said Belize authorities in April 2011 accused him of running a methamphetamine lab, before the November 11 killing of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull, and have since persecuted him. ""I have absolutely nothing to do with the murder in Belize,"" he said Thursday. ""This is not about a murder in Belize. This began on the 30th of April of last year when 42 armed soldiers stormed my property."" Mystery follows McAfee to Miami . After weeks in hiding, the 67-year-old antivirus software company founder emerged in Guatemala's capital last week to ask for asylum. Guatemalan authorities took him into custody on accusations of entering the country illegally, and his asylum bid was rejected. McAfee then waged a public battle, requesting asylum and arguing that police in Belize were after him following his apparent decision to shed light on corruption in the country. He also said the breach resulted in Belize soldiers shooting his dog. CNN cannot independently verify his account. ""He opted to return to his country of origin,"" said attorney Telesforo Guerra, who has represented McAfee since he arrived in Guatemala last week. On Sunday, McAfee told reporters that he hoped to go back to the United States. ""Our intent is to return to America, if at all possible, and settle down to whatever normal life we can settle down to under the circumstances,"" he said. ""There is no hope for my life if I am ever returned to Belize."" Authorities in Belize, where McAfee had lived since 2008, say they want to talk to him about Faull's death. McAfee's home on Ambergris Caye, an island off Belize's mainland, was raided after Faull's death. National police spokesman Raphael Martinez said authorities went into the house amid suspicions there were illicit weapons and drugs inside, but neither were found.","NEW: Belize authorities want to talk to McAfee, a spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- As theater, Hillary Clinton's congressional testimony on the September attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi did not disappoint. The secretary of state was prepared. She was poised. And she was fiery. Clinton likely regrets her exasperated response to persistent questions by Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who repeated the charge that the Obama administration had misled Americans over whether there was a protest on the night of the Benghazi attack, as reports first indicated. She exploded: ""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?"" The response instantly inspired the critical hashtag #WhatDifferenceDoesItMake and became a hot topic on right-wing radio. But otherwise, Republican members of Congress hardly laid a glove on her, perhaps because the party has bizarrely focused on the Obama administration's post-attack talking points instead of more important issues: Does the State Department have the resources and policies it needs to keep American diplomats safe? What level of threat do extremist groups in the region really pose to U.S. interests? And what does the Obama administration want to accomplish there? The hearings should have been more substantive because the United States is at a dangerous inflection point in North Africa and the Sahel region to its south, and leaders in both parties need to think carefully about how deeply we want to get involved in this volatile part of the world. In Libya, the United States has already helped overthrow Moammar Gadhafi, whose vast arsenal has ended up in the hands of some pretty nasty characters. With some in the Pentagon reportedly pushing for drone strikes in Mali, and the United States providing logistical and intelligence help to French forces there, we are gradually getting sucked into conflicts that were never considered our vital concern. In her opening statement, Clinton tried to put the Benghazi attack in this context, describing steps the United States is taking to address ""the broader strategic challenge in North Africa and the wider region."" ""The Arab revolutions have scrambled power dynamics and shattered security forces across the region,"" she said. ""And instability in Mali has created an expanding safe haven for terrorists who look to extend their influence and plot further attacks of the kind we saw just last week in Algeria."" Those attacks, in which a group of jihadists tied to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb seized control over a natural gas facility and took dozens of hostages, are indeed alarming. Oil and gas facilities across North Africa, especially in Libya, are likely vulnerable. U.S. diplomatic facilities are almost certainly at risk. But it's by no means clear what threat al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or for that matter its ally Ansar Dine, one of the Islamist groups controlling northern Mali, poses to the United States. As terrorism exert Daniel Byman notes, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ""largely lost its struggle in Algeria"" before joining forces with al Qaeda's high command in Pakistan and trying to wrap its longstanding fight with the Algerian military into the global jihad. And rebel groups such as the Tuareg have a long history of using harsh tactics to extract concessions from the central government. Is getting involved in their parochial struggles the best way to keep Americans safe? Perhaps a better question is how involved we want to be. Some reports have linked al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which has ties to al Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan, to the Benghazi attack. Three Americans died in the gas plant in Algeria, and seven more barely escaped with their lives. The United States reportedly has had special operations forces in Mali for years. So, in a sense, America already is very much involved. But that doesn't mean the right course of action is to get in deeper. To varying degrees, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and its allies clearly do pose a threat to U.S. interests in their corner of Africa, but there's little evidence that they have the capability or intent to strike the U.S. homeland. The United States needs to lead from behind in this region -- but way, way behind, with French and African forces in the front. Al Qaeda would like nothing more than to drag the United States into another protracted quagmire. In her testimony, Clinton outlined the stakes. ""We are in for a struggle, but it is a necessary struggle. We cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe haven. ""We've got to have a better strategy,"" she said. I couldn't agree more. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Blake Hounshell .","Blake Hounshell: Critics focused on Clinton's fiery comments at hearing, not more pressing issue .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- So little is known about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that the identity of a woman seen by his side during more than one official engagement has sparked a flurry of speculation worldwide. Was the slim woman in the sharp black suit his sister, wife or even lover? No one seems to know, and Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in South Korea, an expert and author of a number of books on North Korea, said it was unlikely speculators would ever find out. ""Everything related to Kim Jong Il's children is a deadly secret. No sane North Korean who knows it would share this out for very special reasons,"" Lankov said. The mystery woman accompanied the young leader to a Pyongyang theater on Friday night to watch a performance of North Korea's Moranbong band. The display included a cast of Disney characters, attracting the attention of The Walt Disney Company, which issued a statement Tuesday saying it had not authorized their use. Clinton says young North Korean leader 'has a choice' Away from the stage, the young woman's presence raised questions too about the purpose of the performance and the message the leadership was intending to convey. A statement released by the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) Saturday made no mention of either the Disney characters or the woman who was seen in official photos distributed worldwide standing and clapping at the end of the performance. Friday's outing wasn't her only high-profile appearance at the North Korean leaders' side. The same woman was seen on state TV Sunday walking a few paces behind Kim as he toured Kumsusan Palace in Pyongyang, then standing to attention at Kim's side as they and top military officials paid tribute to his grandfather Kim Il Sung, North Korea's founding father, on the anniversary of his death. The presence of a female companion to the leader during an official engagement was unusual, Lankov said, and could be part of a campaign to present Kim as ""much more approachable, human-like and soft on people"" than his father, Kim Jong Il. ""He travels much more than his father and even than his grandfather. He likes to hug everybody, physically hug. In this regard it's probably he decided that it might be a good idea to hint that he does have a wife,"" Lankov added. Definitely a wife, Lankov stressed, because the public appearance of a leader's girlfriend or lover would be unthinkable. Even the wives of his father and grandfather stayed firmly in the shadows during their decades in power. ""When his grandfather's first wife, if you like the founding mother of the dynasty, was alive, her name was never, never mentioned in media. Her existence was never even hinted at,"" Lankov said. There was no reference to Kim Il Sung's first wife before her death and for many years there was no mention at all of his second wife, Lankov added. ""It took 15 years before the existence of his wife, his second wife, was ever mentioned in press,"" and even then it was in passing, he said. North Korean leader makes second public speech . In South Korea, the image of Kim's companion made newspaper headlines. A report in South Korean daily Chosun Ilbo said the woman ""seemed to be"" Kim Jung Un's sister, Kim Yeo Jung. ""Born in 1987, Yeo-jong is now in her mid-20s. She apparently went to a school in Switzerland along with Jong-un in the 1990s,"" the newspaper's website said. Her brother Kim came to power in December 2011 after the death of their father, who led the impoverished country for 17 years. Very little was known about Kim when he was granted the title of supreme leader; his age is still a source of speculation, though it's thought he's in his late twenties. ""Three years ago the only thing we knew about him was his existence,"" Lankov said. ""Until, say 2010, as far as I remember we didn't even know how his name was correctly spelt in Korean."" Lankov said it was too early to say whether the tweaks to Kim's public image indicate change ahead for the country. ""This appears to be the beginning of some change, but what it's too early to say. It might just be a minor change in style. It might be something more consequential, I don't know. I would not speculate right now,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The 12-year-old California boy accused of stabbing his 8-year-old sister to death will be tried as juvenile, his attorney said Tuesday. Mark Reichel said he has yet to see the evidence against the boy, but he expects his client to be arraigned Wednesday morning on a second-degree murder charge. Leila Fowler was stabbed multiple times in her family's home in northern California April 27 while she was there with her brother, who is now accused of the crime. ""He's holding up well under the circumstances,"" Reichel said. ""I don't know what they are saying and why they charged him, but if the district attorney's office is charging him because they believe he said something that was untrue, that still doesn't mean he committed this crime."" The boy told police a man had broken into the family's home. Sources: Suspect in sister's death had knife at school . After the killing, police offered a sketchy description of the suspect as a 6-foot-tall white or Hispanic male with a muscular build. They also interviewed registered sex offenders in the area, ran down leads and searched in attics, storage sheds and more in the rural, mountainous community located about 60 miles southeast of Sacramento. They arrested the boy on Saturday. On the day of the killing, Leila's father and his fiancee weren't home. A woman called 911 and told a police dispatcher that her children were scared because a strange man had broken into the house, according to an emergency call released Tuesday. When the dispatcher asks what the emergency is, the woman tells her: ""My children are home alone, and a man just ran out of my house. My older son was in the bathroom and my daughter started screaming. When he came out there was a man inside my house, I need an officer there."" Slain girl's stepmom pleads for privacy after son's arrest . The woman says that the boyfriend of an older daughter was on the phone with the children in the house. The dispatcher asks if the children had seen the man and if they could describe him. ""They did see him, yes. My daughter is freaking out right now,"" she says. After giving the dispatcher a home phone number, she adds, ""They said they are OK, but I need you to come."" Although the call indicates the girl was alive and well, when police arrived, she had been stabbed. Leila died minutes after arriving at the hospital, authorities said. She died of shock and hemorrhages from her wounds, the Calaveras County Coroner's office said. Before Leila's death, the boy's middle school in Valley Springs suspended him for five days after he brought the knife to school, according to one of the boy's classmates. That account was backed up by a school administration source. Authorities haven't revealed what kind of knife was used in Leila's death. The death of Leila, known for her bubbly personality, shook the small northern California town of Valley Springs, where ribbons in her favorite color of purple were tied to stop signs.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Defendants with limited English-language skills have a constitutional right to court interpreters in criminal trials, the Supreme Court of Georgia ruled Monday. The ruling came in a case involving a Mandarin Chinese speaker who was sentenced to 10 years in prison on two counts of cruelty to a child. Annie Ling, who had limited English language skills, did not understand that she had the option to plead guilty instead of going to trial and possibly facing a longer sentence, said the American Civil Liberties Union, one of two groups that filed a friend-of-the-court brief stating that denying a defendant an interpreter violates the U.S. Constitution and civil rights laws. ""The court acknowledged that we don't have two systems of justice in this country -- one for English speakers and another for everyone else,"" said Azadeh Shahshahani, director of the National Security/Immigrants' Rights Project at the ACLU of Georgia. ""The constitutional guarantee of due process applies to everyone in this country, not just fluent English speakers."" Ling was arrested and charged with two counts of cruelty to a child. Her children were removed from the home and placed in foster care, according to court documents. After a 2008 trial, Ling was convicted of one count of cruelty to a child, and sentenced to 15 years, with 10 to serve in prison. The conviction was appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court. The court agreed with the brief, in which the Legal Aid Society-Employment Law Center joined with the ACLU, that the Sixth Amendment and the due process clause of the 14th Amendment guarantee the defendant the right to an interpreter. The Georgia Supreme Court also instructed all Georgia state courts to practice ""vigilance in protecting the rights of non-English-speakers.""","Defendant says she did not understand her options .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge in Pennsylvania has dismissed Gov. Tom Corbett's antitrust lawsuit against the NCAA over its sanctions against Penn State University following the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal. U.S. District Judge Yvette Kane called the lawsuit ""a Hail Mary pass"" in her ruling, even as she expressed some sympathy for Corbett's arguments. But in the end, she said, the governor's complaint doesn't meet the legal standards of an antitrust case. ""The governor's complaint implicates the extraordinary power of a non-governmental entity to dictate the course of an iconic public institution, and raises serious questions about the indirect economic impact of NCAA sanctions on innocent parties,"" Kane wrote. ""These are important questions deserving of public debate, but they are not antitrust questions."" The NCAA levied unprecedented sanctions against the university last July, fining it $60 million and stripping 14 seasons of football victories from late head coach Joe Paterno. ""These sanctions did not punish Sandusky,"" or those who allegedly helped cover up his repeated sexual abuse of disadvantaged children, Corbett said at the time. The NCAA argued that antitrust cases affect commercial activity, while its athletes are amateurs. But Kane said the organization's actions in the Sandusky case go beyond previous actions ""related to amateurism and fair play held to be non-commercial."" ""In another forum,"" Kane wrote, Corbett's ""appeal to equity and common sense may win the day. But in the antitrust world these arguments fail to advance the ball."" Sandusky, 68, was convicted last June on 45 counts of child sex abuse, ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, which were laid out in graphic testimony by his accusers over the course of the less-than-two-week trial. In October, he was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison, meaning he'll likely die behind bars. Paterno, who coached at Penn State for 46 years, was fired after Sandusky's arrest in November 2011. He had been the all-time leader in major college football victories for a coach, with 409 wins. The NCAA's decision strikes 111 of those from his record, beginning in 1998 -- a move that posthumously bumps him from the top of the list. A university-funded review of the scandal, led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, accused former university president Graham Spanier, Paterno, suspended Athletic Director Tim Curley and ex-Vice President Gary Schultz of taking part in a cover-up to avoid bad publicity. The scandal led to Spanier's ouster and shocked the nation after Freeh's team concluded that the school's top administrators had ""empowered"" Sandusky, the former defensive coordinator for the football team, to continue his abuse. The school's $60 million fine is expected to be paid over five years and will fund an endowment with a mission of fighting child sex abuse and supporting victims.","Pennsylvania's governor sued the NCAA over its sanctions on Penn State .

"(CNN) -- The milestones keep coming for Roger Federer, but the tennis superstar had to dig deep at the French Open on Sunday before notching his 900th career win and reaching his 36th successive grand slam quarterfinal. Federer made a flying start against home hope Gilles Simon, but then lost the next two sets to raise the prospect of his earliest defeat at a major tournament since he lost in the third round at Roland Garros to Gustavo Kuerten in 2004. An uncharacteristic fall on the red clay by the Swiss in the seventh game of the second set heralded a change of momentum. However, he regained his composure to triumph 6-1 4-6 2-6 6-2 6-3 and earn a clash with another Frenchman, sixth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. ""It was a great atmosphere in which to play like this. It became difficult in the second set as Gilles turned it around,"" said the 17-time grand slam champion, who has lost only once in 23 times he has had to play five sets. ""I am proud of the record. It's a lot of years, a lot of sacrifices and a lot of matches like this."" Simon had won five-set matches in the first and third rounds, but was unable to reach the second grand slam quarterfinal of his career -- the only one being in Australia in 2009. Federer, whose only French Open triumph was in 2009, became the fourth player to reach 900 wins -- Ivan Lendl was the last to do so in 1990. The 31-year-old Swiss has won 81.5% of those matches, with just 204 defeats. He has a 9-3 career record against Tsonga, who beat Serbia's Viktor Troicki 6-3 6-3 6-3 to reach the quarterfinals of his home event for the second successive year. Interactive: The secrets of French Open champions . France has not had a male champion since Yannick Noah in 1983, and Tsonga is looking to make up for last year's heartbreak -- when he blew four match-points in a five-set defeat by world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. ""I'm playing well, so all the lights are green,"" the 28-year-old said. ""Everything is positive. I have nothing to lose."" Fourth seed David Ferrer will take on this year's surprise package Tommy Robredo in an all-Spanish quarterfinal. Robredo became the first man in 86 years to come back from two sets down in three successive matches in a grand slam as he defeated 11th-seeded compatriot Nicolas Almagro 6-7 (5-7) 3-6 6-4 6-4 6-4. The 31-year-old, who this time last year had dropped from a career-high fifth in the rankings to a lowly 470th after 14 months out with injury, trailed 4-1 in the third set before launching an another incredible comeback. ""Maybe he had a little bit of doubt, though, in that moment,"" said 34th-ranked Robredo, who also reached the last eight in Paris in 2003, 2005 and 2009. ""Then I just pushed hard and I won the third. And then I was just dreaming and dreaming to try to do it again, and I did it."" Almagro, who has reached two finals on the ATP Tour this year, also led 4-2 in the fourth set and 2-0 in the decider. ""I had my ups and downs. These ups and downs cost me the match,"" said the 27-year-old, who also blew a two-set lead against Ferrer in January's Australian Open quarterfinals. ""I think Tommy produced a remarkable, admirable game. I have every respect for what he did. For my part, I need to move on as best I can."" Ferrer, a semifinalist last year, dropped just five games as he crushed South African 23rd seed Kevin Anderson 6-3 6-1 6-1. ""I'm very happy with my game today,"" said Ferrer, who has not lost a set in four matches. ""Maybe I played the best match of this week.""","Second seed Roger Federer reaches his 36th consecutive grand slam quarterfinal .

"(CNN) -- A fire broke out Wednesday night on Alabama's Mobile River after two barges loaded with natural gas exploded not far from where a once listless Carnival cruise ship was docked, authorities said. The Mobile Fire-Rescue Department, on its official Twitter feed, reported that it had ""units on the scene on east side of Mobile River where a fuel barge has exploded and is on fire."" Minutes later, the fire department issued an update stating that two barges had exploded. Three people who were burned were transported to a local hospital, fire department spokesman Steve Huffman told CNN. He did not describe the severity of their injuries. All people are believed to have been accounted for, Huffman added. There were at least three explosions tied to the incident, Mobile Fire-Rescue noted around 9:30 p.m. (10:30 p.m. ET) on Twitter. Huffman said Wednesday night that authorities hadn't determined what caused the blasts. A 1-mile safety zone has been set up around the barges, U.S. Coast Guard Cmdr. Eric King said. Authorities have closed the shipping channel and were letting the fires burn. The fires burned near the docking area of the Carnival Triumph, he added. The Triumph has been based at the BAE Shipyard in the Port of Mobile since an engine fire in February left it crippled and adrift in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 4,200 people aboard. For four days, tugboats guided the disabled ship into the port as passengers complained about miserable conditions onboard. CNN's Greg Botelho and Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","NEW: All people are believed to be accounted for, a fire spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Two days before George Zimmerman goes on trial, voice recognition experts testified it is not possible to positively identify whose screams are heard in the background of the 911 calls made the night Trayvon Martin was shot. Florida Judge Debra Nelson will continue the hearing on the admissibility of the experts' testimony at a later date. Jury selection begins Monday. A third audio expert was unable to testify Saturday because he was stuck on a plane. The defense argues the state's audio experts are using unproven science to determine who is heard screaming and they shouldn't be allowed to testify. Nelson wanted to hear about the technology used for voice analysis. Trayvon Martin shooting Fast Facts . Forensic audio expert Dr. Peter French, who testified via teleconference from the United Kingdom, described research involving the recording of stressed cries versus normal voice samples. In the case of the 911 calls, French said that the poor quality of the recorded voices means that none of the processes available can provide any useful information about the identity of the screaming person. ""I've never come across a case in the 30 years of my career where anybody has attempted to compare screaming with normal voices,"" French said. French also said in this case the recording ""isn't even remotely suitable for speaker comparison."" George Doddington, an electrical engineer who works as an adviser with the National Security Agency, testified Saturday that his conclusion about the 911 call was similar to Dr. French's: that due to the quality of the data, it is not going to provide any viable source for making an identity decision. Doddington said evaluating one second of speech to reach a conclusion is ""ridiculous."" ""The less you have, the worse the performance,"" he said. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of Martin, 17, on February 26, 2012, in Sanford, Florida. He says he shot the teenager in self-defense. The audio technology may be key to the prosecution's case because its experts' testimony may be able to shed light on what was said between Zimmerman and Martin moments before the teenager was shot. Alan Reich, a voice analysis expert who testified Friday, believes that the screams recorded were not Zimmerman, but more likely came from Martin. Ted Owens, a forensic audio engineer, testified Friday that his analysis of the 911 call indicated that the person screaming was not Zimmerman, and the person screaming is frantically asking for help in different ways before the gunshot is heard. If the prosecution experts' analysis indicates Martin screamed for help, it could hurt the credibility of Zimmerman's claim that he acted in self-defense. The law states that for technology to be admissible, it must be ""generally accepted"" in that particular field. Zimmerman's attorneys are arguing the technology does not satisfy that threshold.","George Zimmerman trial starts Monday in Florida .

"(CNN) -- President Obama took a great first step in making our country safer Wednesday when he signed executive actions to reduce gun violence and urged Congress to reinstate the 2004 assault weapons ban. But the president's actions do not let the rest of us off the hook. Each one of us needs to decide on our own how we will participate in shaping our country's future. Let the families of Newtown grieve. The rest of us need to get to work. Read Obama's proposals . In 2003, my cousin's 15-year-old son was shot and killed by a robber. My cousin found solidarity with other parents whose children had been snatched by gun violence, making instant activists out of moms and dads. As I thought of the parents of Newtown over the past month, steeped in their grief, I realized how little I know, how little I have ever wanted to know, about the circumstances surrounding the gun death closest to me. I don't know what kind of gun was used to murder my own relative. Even if I did, what would it mean to me? I've never owned a gun nor have I ever touched one. I have never even knowingly been in the presence of one. I have taken false and selfish comfort in believing that guns and the chaos connected to them were worlds away. Not wanting to wade into the debate around gun control, my position on guns has been one of naivety and willed ignorance. But I won't avoid it any longer. Opinion: NRA's paranoid fantasy flouts democracy . It is much easier to cry in front of my television and feel helpless than to learn what these weapons are, what they do and what I can do to make events like Newtown, Aurora, Tuscon and Virginia Tech less likely to happen again. My relationship to my community needs to be one but of action. I have to learn the names and capacities of assault style rifles as I would learn the names and potencies of common poisons for my own safety. A semiautomatic handgun can theoretically shoot 1,500 rounds in seven minutes if a shooter could possible manage it. The Bushmaster M4 Types Carbine, a semiautomatic rifle, uses a 20 or 30-round magazine. It may seem daunting to enter into the fray of a heated issue, to shape public opinion and to push our elected officials to substantive change, but we've done it before. In the 1960s, everyday people, from maids to college students and church members, said ""enough is enough"" to the back of the bus, separate water fountains and segregated lunch counters. Nearly two decades later, a mother who lost her child to a drunken driver launched the organization Mothers Against Drunk Driving and led the country to enduring cultural and legislative transformation to stop drunken driving and to institute stricter alcohol policies. Voices of the people played a role in the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968 and public opinion pushed Congress to pass the 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Our voices count. Politics: Would Obama's gun violence measures work? Yes, civil discourse can be uncivil. But don't let toxic Internet trolls and television zealots stop you from participating in this vital public discussion. The grieving families of Newtown and the grieving families of the hundreds of people who will have died from gun shootings since Sandy Hook will be conscripted to the front lines of the gun control debate. But we can't let them fight it on their own. Because the truth is, when an average of eight children die from gun violence every day in this country, nobody is left untouched by a shooting death. Eventually, that evil will make its mark, directly or indirectly, on all of us. In the wake of the one-month anniversary of the Newtown shootings, the country's grief over mass shootings, one-on-one gun violence and unintentional gun deaths weighs so heavily on our collective conscience that once again the nation seems ready to take action. Yes, our elected officials must lead and we must hold them accountable if they don't. But we must do our part as well. We have to organize and shape public opinion to make it easier for the president and Congress to do what they must. We can start by educating ourselves. Know what these weapons of mass destruction do, know who is trying to stop research on gun safety, know what organizations are pushing for more comprehensive bans. Once we're educated, we can educate our friends and families and build a groundswell, home by home, street by street and block by block. Because that is what this is going to take. It's going to take all of us. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Terri Francis.","Terri Francis: Obama took good first step to end gun violence with his executive actions .
But that's not enough, she says; we are all still responsible and need to get to work .
Francis' cousin's son was shot and killed, but she buried her head in the sand on the issue .
Now, she realizes that she and all Americans need to get educated and act for gun control ."
"Editor's note: Tony Newman is the director of media relations at the Drug Policy Alliance Network. Tony Newman says cigarettes kill more people than drugs that are illegal. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Cigarettes kill; 400,000 people die prematurely every year from smoking. When we analyze the harm from drugs, there is no doubt that cigarettes are the worst. They kill more people than cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and all other illegal drugs combined. More than 800,000 people are arrested every year for marijuana, the vast majority for possession, yet all the data from studies that compare the two substances show that cigarettes are more harmful to an individual's health. If we make these other drugs illegal, shouldn't we outlaw the leading killer? Considering how we deal with less harmful drugs, making cigarettes illegal seems logical. Over the past decade, we have seen, in states from California to New York, increasing restrictions on when and where people can smoke -- and even momentum toward tobacco prohibition. Smoking is banned in bars and restaurants and on some university campuses. People can now be fired from their jobs because they can't give up smoking. We have seen parents denied adoption rights if they smoke. In some cities, it is nearly impossible to smoke anywhere besides your own home. The Drug Policy Alliance sponsored a Zogby Poll in 2006, and we were shocked to find that 45 percent of those polled supported making cigarettes illegal within the next 10 years. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, it's more than 50 percent. But with all of the good intentions in the world, outlawing cigarettes would be just as disastrous as the prohibition on other drugs. After all, people would still smoke, just as they still use other drugs that are prohibited, from marijuana to cocaine. But now, in addition to the harm of smoking, we would find a whole range of ""collateral consequences"" that come along with prohibition. A huge number of people who smoke would continue to do so, but now they would be considered criminals. We would have parents promising their kids that they will stop smoking but still sneaking a smoke. We would have smokers hiding their habit and smoking in alleys and dark corners, afraid of being caught using the illegal substance. We would have cops using precious time and resources to hassle and arrest cigarette smokers. Our prison overcrowding crisis would rise to an unprecedented level with ""addicts"" and casual cigarette smokers alike getting locked up. We would have a black market, with outlaws taking the place of delis and supermarkets and stepping in to meet the demand and provide the desired drug. Instead of buying your cigarettes in a legally sanctioned place, you would have to hit the streets to pick up your fix. The cigarette trade would provide big revenue to ""drug dealers,"" just as illegal drugs do today. There would be shootouts in the streets and killings over the right to sell the prohibited tobacco plant. We have tried prohibiting cigarettes in some state prisons, like in California, and we have seen that smoking continues, with cigarettes traded illicitly. There is a violent black market that fills the void and leads to unnecessary deaths over access and the inflated profits. Luckily, no one is proposing making cigarettes illegal. On the contrary, our public health campaign around cigarettes has been a model of success compared with our results with other prohibited drugs. By placing high taxes on cigarettes, restricting locations where one can smoke and banning certain kinds of advertising, we have seen a significant decline in the number of people who smoke. Instead of giving teens ""reefer madness""-style propaganda, we have treated young people with respect and given them honest education about the harm of cigarettes, and we have been rewarded with fewer young people smoking today than ever before. Although we should celebrate our success and continue to encourage people to cut back or give up smoking, let's not get carried away and think that prohibition would eliminate smoking. We need to realize that drugs, from cigarettes to marijuana to alcohol, will always be consumed, whether they are legal or illegal. Although drugs have health consequences and dangers, making them illegal -- and keeping them illegal -- will only bring additional death and suffering. Don't just take my word for it. Take it from the news anchor  who was called the most trusted man in America, Walter Cronkite. Here is what he said about prohibition and our war on drugs: ""I covered the Vietnam War. I remember the lies that were told, the lives that were lost -- and the shock when, 20 years after the war ended, former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara admitted he knew it was a mistake all along. ... ""And I cannot help but wonder how many more lives, and how much more money, will be wasted before another Robert McNamara admits what is plain for all to see: The war on drugs is a failure.""

"(CNN) -- The biggest occasion in their 81-year history is approaching for minnows Wigan but the FA Cup final might prove an unwelcome distraction in their battle to retain English Premier League status. A crushing 3-2 home defeat to Swansea on Tuesday left the plucky club from the north west staring at relegation to England's second tier after eight years of defying the odds. Roberto Martinez's side, famous for miraculous escapes in previous years, now find themselves three points adrift of safety with just two games remaining. It means their clash with Manchester City in England's premier domestic cup competition at Wembley on Saturday could be their last slice of the limelight for some time. Conversely, City warmed up for the showpiece final with a 1-0 win over West Bromwich Albion, that edged them towards a second place finish behind champions Manchester United. Wigan had taken the lead over Swansea, nestled safely in mid table, thanks to a volley from Roger Espinoza but shortly after halftime Angel Rangel equalized with an equally smart volley. James McCarthy restored Wigan's lead finishing off a fine move but then Wigan shot themselves in the foot with some sloppy defending which has blighted their season. First a poor pass from Gary Caldwell allowed Itey Shechter to level things at 2-2 before a mix up in the six-yard box allowed Dwight Tiendalli to scramble home the winning goal. With a trip to Arsenal and a home clash with Aston Villa left, Wigan now have a mountain to climb, but Martinez tried to remain positive. ""Today the number of injuries we have had at the back shows and there are key moments that affected us,"" Martinez told Sky Sports. ""We conceded sloppy goals with bad decisions and that's very unfortunate because you could see the effort of the players and the desire to want to win the game. ""Emotionally today was such a difficult game for us and when you concede such goals in a soft manner then it is hard to recover. ""It's a missed opportunity. We've got incredible character and we're determined to fight for every single point there is left."" City rested several players ahead of the cup final and their winner came from Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko. It moved them seven points clear of third placed Chelsea. Roberto Mancini told reporters: ""It was a difficult game because we changed a lot of players but it was important for us to win the game. ""After 10 minutes we started to play better and we missed five incredible chances to score which made it difficult for us in the second half."" In Italy, Roma missed the chance to draw level on points with fifth-placed Fiorentina in Serie A after they lost to Chievo Verona.

"(CNN) -- Indianapolis is known for Indy 500 car racing and its playoff-worthy Pacers basketball team. But this week, astronomers like me have taken over the town for the 222nd meeting of the American Astronomical Society. You may have seen coverage of new discoveries about exoplanets, star formation, dwarf galaxies, cosmology and more. A public star party on Monday evening gave the public a chance to see Saturn and other sights, followed by the International Space Station whizzing overhead. Tuesday evening, Zooniverse founder Chris Lintott gave a public lecture, ""Discovering Planets from Your Sofa: Adventures in Citizen Science,"" about how hundreds of thousands of interested citizens are making original scientific discoveries, including finding new exoplanets. Astronomical Society meetings are terrific for learning about the latest research, networking with colleagues, recruiting graduate students or forming new research collaborations. But something is very different about this particular conference. That's because many colleagues who work for federal agencies like the National Science Foundation and NASA have been told to stay home. Deep cuts in already paltry federal travel budgets mean federal scientists are not presenting their research findings. There is less communication between program officers and the scientists who carry out the Science Foundation and NASA missions. Important work funded by taxpayer dollars is not being disseminated, reducing return on investment. There are fewer conversations in which NSF and NASA officials learn about astronomers' latest results and talk about agency plans. Hundreds of thousands of scientists work in the federal government. To take just one example, NASA scientists were instrumental in deducing the initial fluctuations in matter density in the newborn universe, 13.7 billion years ago, which led to the formation of galaxies like the one we live in today. This work garnered the Nobel prize for physics. The nation benefits when top scientists like these contribute their efforts to the federal agencies. But civil service scientists are at a significant competitive disadvantage, thanks to new travel restrictions. At first glance, it might sound like a good idea to keep government employees and contractors from traveling to distant cities to meet with colleagues. After all, budgets are tight and travel costs money. Stories about excessive spending at government conferences involving the IRS and GSA have rightly angered taxpayers who have had to tighten their own belts. But the Astronomical Society conference is strictly business and the downside of missing it is considerable: The government loses touch, government scientists fall behind and we all lose an opportunity to forge ahead. For NASA, which funds about 300,000 jobs at more than a dozen NASA centers and facilities, its cap of 50 civil service scientists and contractors (or even100, possible only with a waiver) at an American Astronomical Society meeting is very low. CEO Marissa Mayer pulled her Yahoo employees back into the office, away from telecommuting, because personal interactions are vital to innovation. Science is no different. We do use e-mail, Skype, video conferences and every other modern technique to save money and time. But every so often, you have to have a real conversation. Government scientists are evaluated regularly, like most of us, and their scientific stature is measured in part by invitations to give talks at international meetings or to help lead those meetings. Yet federal scientists and contractors are prevented from attending any international meetings. Let's be clear: Not only can't government employees travel to meetings on the government's dime, they can't present the results of their scientific research at all, even if they take vacation days and pay for the travel. Travel policies that diminish the effectiveness of government scientists are counterproductive. Not only does the work have less impact, some of our nation's very best scientific talent will choose to leave government service. This is good news for universities and companies who offer these outstanding scientists a better research environment. But the government ends up losing top talent. Science careers are attractive in many ways, but across the country, sequestration is devastating budgets for research. In many disciplines, 10 proposals for new research projects are rejected for every one that is funded. This turns serious scientific progress into a scattershot lottery and discourages students from pursuing the kind of research careers that fuel our economy in the long term. Young people are attracted to science through astronomy. Students come to our talks, star parties and classes. Fascination about black holes and dark energy motivates them to study critical subjects like physics, mathematics and computing. Astronomy research experiences for undergraduates -- funded by the National Science Foundation, among others -- are an effective way to retain students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, or STEM, majors. STEM disciplines are critical for the future of our nation. The skills for astronomy are used in many other fields of science, not to mention areas like data mining and computing that are at the heart of modern businesses. My own research students study supermassive black holes billions of light years from Earth -- not exactly an issue in daily life, it's true, but while some of those students have pursued careers as astronomers, many have gone into other areas, including theoretical physics, high school science teaching, oceanography, energy, veterinary school, the financial industry and computing, contributing in important ways to the STEM enterprise. A recent article in the prestigious journal Nature shows that the best science comes from international collaborations. So our short-sighted policies are preventing government scientists from conducting the best possible research, not to mention losing U.S. leadership in important international efforts. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Meg Urry.","Meg Urry: American Astronomy Society conference highlights new discoveries .

"(CNN) -- A top Syrian general has reportedly defected from President Bashar al-Assad's government, telling an Arabic news station in an interview that aired Saturday that morale among security forces in Syria is at a low. The reported defection followed the United Nations announcement that one of its employees, a teacher, was killed during fighting between rebels and government forces at a refugee camp outside Damascus. If confirmed, Maj. Gen. Mohammed Ezz al-Din Khalouf's defection is the latest in a series of such moves by high-profile government officials, raising questions about the stability of al-Assad's government two years into the civil war gripping the country. Khalouf, head of logistics and supply for the Syrian army, told the Arabic news network Al Arabiya that many tied to al-Assad's government have lost faith, but continue to pledge their allegiance to the president. ""It is only for appearance's sake to present an image to the international community showing that the regime is the one that pulls together all segments of Syrian society under."" Khalouf told Al Arabiya he had been working with rebels to defect. He appeared in the interview with his son, a Syrian army captain, who defected with him. There was no immediate reaction from the Syrian government on the reported defection, which follows the two-year anniversary of the uprising. Rebels posted what they claim are two videos on YouTube that offer proof that they helped Khalouf and his family escape Syria through Daraa province into Jordan. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the videos, but Al Arabiya reported the interview with Khalouf was conducted in Jordan. U.N. employee killed at camp . The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine Refugees confirmed Saturday that a member of its teaching staff was killed Wednesday trying to flee the fighting at the Khan Eshieh refugee camp in Syria. Nasri Khalil Hasan was killed while trying to make his way with his wife and four children to a makeshift shelter after the camp was reportedly struck by an artillery shell, the UNRWA said in a statement. Hasan was hit by shrapnel from a subsequent explosion, it said. Because the hospital at the refugee camp was not open, he was taken to a hospital in the nearby city of Jdaydeh, according to the UNRWA. He died at the hospital the next day, the agency said. Cluster bombs linked to civilian casualties . The news of Khalouf's apparent defection and the death of Hasan came the same day a human rights group accused Syrian forces of using an increasing number of cluster bombs in residential areas. Human Rights Watch says its researchers have identified 119 locations across Syria, where at least 156 cluster bombs have been used from August to mid-February. The result is ""mounting civilian casualties,"" the rights group said. Human Rights Watch said it has investigated two cluster bomb attacks in the past two weeks -- in Deir Jamal, near Aleppo, and Talbiseh, near Homs. These attacks killed 11 civilians, including two women and five children, and injured 27 others, the rights group said. ""Syria is expanding its relentless use of cluster munitions, a banned weapon, and civilians are paying the price with their lives and limbs,"" said Steve Goose, director of the arms division at Human Rights Watch. ""The initial toll is only the beginning because cluster munitions often leave unexploded bomblets that kill and maim long afterward."" The Syrian government did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. In October, Syrian armed forces denied the possession or use of cluster bombs. A statement released through the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said ""misleading media outlets"" had published ""untrue news claiming the Syrian Arab Army has been using cluster bombs against terrorists."" The Syrian army ""does not possess such bombs,"" it said, adding that the media reports were ""aimed at diverting the public opinion from the practices of the armed terrorist groups against civilians."" The Human Rights Watch report is based on field investigations, analysis of video footage posted by activists and eyewitness reports, it said. The collection of data does not include details of casualty numbers but many deaths and injuries have been documented, the group said. ""Remnants of at least 156 distinct cluster bombs have been identified so far from the video footage,"" the group said. ""Human Rights Watch has documented government use of cluster munitions, both air-dropped and ground-delivered, but it has seen no evidence of cluster munition use by opposition rebel groups."" Weapons are indiscriminate . Another rights group, Amnesty International, has accused the Syrian government of using cluster bombs in civilian areas. ""Civilians continue to be at the receiving end of increasingly frequent indiscriminate attacks by Syrian government forces,"" Amnesty said in a report Thursday. ""Internationally banned cluster munitions are being used daily against civilian residential areas in towns and villages, in utter disregard for the most fundamental principles of international humanitarian law."" The report said the ""vast majority"" of abuses were committed by Syrian government forces, but that rebel groups are also carrying out abuses such as kidnapping and summary executions. Syria is not one of the 111 states worldwide that have signed up to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which bans their use. The United States also is not a signatory. Cluster munitions are widely viewed as unacceptable because the bomblets spread across a wide area and make no distinction between civilians and fighters. Death toll . CNN cannot independently verify death tolls or other accounts of violence in Syria. Last month, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said about 70,000 people had been killed in the two-year-old conflict. The Syrian army continued to hunt ""terrorists"" -- its description of rebel fighters -- in several areas on Saturday, including outside Damascus and Homs, and in Idlib province, the Syrian Arab News Agency reported.","NEW: Syrian Maj.

"(CNN) -- Social media sites have evolved into the global equivalent of the office watercooler, but could the buzz they generate be analyzed to predict real-world outcomes? Leading British economist Noreena Hertz thinks so. She believes analyzing the chatter from Twitter and Facebook for example, will become a dominant force in the business of forecasting. ""Over the past few years I have been really quite obsessed with how technology is changing the way that we make sense of the world,"" she told CNN at Names not Numbers, an idea-sharing and networking conference in the UK. Read more: Facebook's new Graph Search tool . Last year, Hertz carried out an experiment to demonstrate the power of social networks as a tool for better understanding human behavior. ""I was really interested to see whether we could make predictions or forecasts by listening in on what people were saying on social media. Because, if we could improve upon the political forecasts; if we could improve upon sales forecasts by listening in on people's chatter on Twitter, Facebook, those sorts of media, that would be a really exciting prospect.,"" she said. Her and a team of computer scientists, sociologists, and economists worked together to develop a method of research that they hoped would enable them to predict the winner of talent contest ""The X Factor"". By developing a sophisticated algorithm, the team effectively ""listened in"" on hundreds of thousands of tweets at once and deduced not just the number and subject of messages but also, for the first time, the sentiment. In doing so they were able to make an accurate guess about who would stay and go each week. ""We were pretty much beating the bookies,"" she said. Read more: Facebook 'likes' can reveal your secrets, study finds . Hertz has made a career out of challenging the predictive powers of traditional forecasting models, which she says are far from perfect. After all, she says, analysts in the Middle East failed to predict the Arab Spring and very few experts saw the financial meltdown coming -- something she did three years before in her book ""IOU: The Debt Threat"". An influential economist, Hertz has a knack for prescience that has put her ahead of the curve among her peers. Her work is all about conducting research that gives raw data some context. It's about understanding the culture, language and psychology of social media users, which, she says, has huge implications for both business and government. Under her school of her thought, in order for social media marketing to have any real value we need to understand what people's actions really mean. ""If somebody tweets 'I like Coca-Cola', does that mean that they're actually going to buy Coca-Cola? One can? Two cans? Three cans? If they retweet someone else's Tweet, does that mean they're going to buy it?"" At the age of 19, Hertz gained her degree at University College London (UCL) and then moved to the U.S. to study for an MBA. In her early twenties, she found herself in St. Petersburg educating Boris Yeltsin's advisers in market economics. Here she gained inspiration for her PhD thesis, ""Russian Business Relationships in the Wake of Reform"", at the University of Cambridge. In 2002 she wrote the book ""The Silent Takeover,"" which discussed the migration of power from government to corporations. In it she correctly anticipated that unregulated markets and huge financial institutions would, in the near future, have grave consequences for the rest of the world.

"(CNN) -- As a psychiatrist, former university president and advocate for Arab women in science, Rafia Ghubash is one of the United Arab Emirates' most influential women. But her latest project is possibly her most ambitious yet: creating the Middle East's first museum dedicated to the achievements of women. The museum, Bait al Banaat, or House of Women, in Dubai was officially opened at the end of 2012 by Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, showcasing the contribution of women to the country's history. ""Women here were empowered a long time ago, but haven't had a chance to tell our story,"" said Ghubash. ""Don't think because we are covered we are not empowered. ""Women here were not in the media, but they were economically engaged and running businesses."" The museum is the culmination of five years' work for Ghubash, who financed the museum with $3 million of her own money. ""For me it was a full-time job but I had 20 volunteers of all nationalities working with me in their free time. It was nice to have people with different backgrounds involved,"" she said. In searching for a home for the museum, Ghubash turned down a free site in Dubai's official heritage district for an old house in the historic Gold Souk neighborhood she grew up in. ""I was looking for a place to build and I came across a very old house that I remember from childhood,"" she said. ""It used to be called Bait al Banaat because three unmarried women lived there. Something about the name came to life for me."" Ghubash said her grandmothers' generation contributed far more to the politics, economy, education and literature of the region than has been recognized. Arianna Huffington tells women: 'Less stress, more living' The museum contains a room dedicated to the Emirati woman poet Ousha Bint Khalifa -- known as the Girl of Arabia, a gallery devoted to temporary art exhibitions, a collection of Arabian fragrances and oils, traditional jewelery and a women's study center. ""It was very important for me to present the museum in the best way possible to attract a younger generation. I want them to enjoy their culture and heritage,"" said Ghubash. Ghubash, 56, has undertaken the museum project while taking a sabbatical from a career that led to her being listed 36th on Arabian Business magazine's ""100 Most Powerful Arab Women"" in 2011. She grew up in Dubai in a family where she was encouraged to study. ""I came from a family where both parents made sure there were books available in the house,"" she said. ""I had freedom to read and to think for myself."" Ghubash trained as a doctor at the University of Cairo and for a PhD in London, before returning to the United Arab Emirates as an assistant professor of psychiatry. In 2001, she became president of the Arabian Gulf University in Bahrain, a post she retained until 2009. She also founded the Arab Network of Women in Science and Technology, and served as its president for four years. ""My journey in life is very interesting,"" she said. ""I was focusing on becoming a doctor and practicing as a psychiatrist. ""Recently, I found myself attracted to something different: history and culture."" Having achieved her goal in opening the museum, Ghubash is not content to rest and revel in the glory. She is already working on her next project to compile an encyclopaedia of women of the United Arab Emirates.","Rafia Ghubash spent five years working on Middle East's first women's museum .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate's top Democrat said Tuesday he will force a vote this week on whether to open debate on tougher gun laws, increasing pressure on legislators from both parties negotiating a possible compromise on a package that some Republicans have threatened to filibuster. A GOP filibuster would mean Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid needs 60 votes on Thursday just to begin Senate consideration of the package based on proposals by President Barack Obama in the aftermath of the Newtown school massacre in December that killed 20 first-graders and six educators. Obama has made gun measures a major focus of his second term agenda, holding events across the country to push for Congress to vote on the package. Background checks on gun sales: How do they work? He spoke Monday in Connecticut, the state where the Newtown shootings occurred, and Vice President Joe Biden made a similar call for action at the White House on Tuesday. Reid told reporters he hoped to get a bipartisan deal before the procedural vote on Thursday. Talks involving Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania have focused on a compromise on expanding background checks of gun buyers. Manchin indicated late on Tuesday the two were close to an agreement and have scheduled a news conference for Wednesday morning. A Manchin aide told CNN they are ""hopeful"" to have a deal to announce. CNN Poll: Background checks popular, worrisome . Separately, Democratic leaders appear increasingly optimistic they will get enough Republican votes to overcome a threatened filibuster on starting debate. Democrats believe as many as a dozen Republicans will side with them and that will more than make up for the handful of pro-gun Democrats who might not. At least five Republicans have publicly opposed the filibuster pledged by 14 of their Senate colleagues, including GOP leader Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. McConnell later told reporters his filibuster threat referred to the specific package approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and indicated he might be open to a compromise. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, said Tuesday she favored opening debate on the bill as long as amendments can be offered, adding: ""I think it's an important debate to have and I do not believe we should block the motion to proceed."" Without a deal, a successful Republican filibuster would stop consideration of the gun legislation before any votes on specific provisions. Democratic leaders want to give senators from both parties ample opportunity to amend the bill and are prepared to debate it beyond a scheduled recess the first week of May, if doing so will increase chances of passage. ""The way you put together a coalition to pass the bill is to allow as many amendment votes as you can. We are willing to take the time to do that and have that process,"" a Democratic leadership aide told CNN. Obama's rhetoric has reflected the political uncertainty, with the president and his aides using increasingly personal language intended to shame Republicans into allowing public votes on measures that have public support but are fiercely opposed by the influential National Rifle Association. Opinion: Why the NRA fights background checks . ""If senators don't have the guts to go on the record to vote how they feel on this issue ... that would be a shame and that would be a disservice to their constituents,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Tuesday. At a later White House event intended to keep up the public profile of the issue, Biden said Republican efforts to block tougher gun laws showed they were in a ""time warp"" because public support on issues such as expanded background checks ""has moved beyond where it was five, ten, even three years ago."" On the other side, the NRA and its supporters in Congress argue the Democratic proposals threaten the constitutional right to bear arms, and also offer ineffective responses intended as political show instead of real solutions to the problem of gun violence in America. ""On firearms questions, on Second Amendment questions, there's a divide in this country,"" NRA President David Keene told CNN. ""To call it an ideological divide is too simple because it's a cultural divide. When something happens, the folks on the other side from us say, 'well the problem's the gun, we need to do something about guns.'"" Defeat of the entire package in the Democratic-led Senate would kill gun legislation for now, which would be a stinging defeat for Obama and Democrats pushing for tougher laws. However, a public perception that Republicans blocked popular proposals such as expanding background checks of gun buyers could harm GOP prospects in 2014 and 2016 among moderates they need to have any chance of countering strong support for Democrats by minority demographics such as Hispanic Americans, African Americans and the gay-lesbian vote. With the high political stakes come hardball tactics and strategies. The NRA has long kept a comprehensive scorecard of the voting records of legislators on gun issues, which it combines with campaign contributions to try to influence elections. In response, a group led by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called Mayors Against Illegal Guns announced this week it was launching its own scorecard to identify members of Congress who vote against tougher gun laws. ""We're asked many times daily where people's elected representatives are on gun laws, and we intend to tell them, in detail,"" said Mark Glaze, director of the group of more than 900 mayors, of the campaign that will feature more than $1 million in cable television ads. Why is this so hard? The disconnect on background checks . While most of the 12 legislators targeted by the ads are Republicans, some are Democrats from conservative-leaning states, such as rural Western states where hunting and sport shooting are popular. The Judiciary Committee passed a package of gun laws proposed by Obama in the Newtown attack by a lone gunman. Proposals in the committee's package included expanding background checks on gun buyers, toughening laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases, banning semi-automatic rifles modeled after military assault weapons as well as large-capacity ammunition magazines, and coming up with ideas for improving school safety. The weapons ban, which would update a similar 1994 law that expired a decade later, already has been dropped, though Reid, D-Nevada, has promised a floor vote on it as an amendment to the package. Reid and the White House are pushing hard for expanding background checks to all gun purchases to close a loophole that exempts private sales, such as transactions at gun conventions. Should anyone be able to buy guns? Share your views . On Tuesday, Reid made a highly personal reference to his own perspective on the issue. Noting that his home state requires a three-day waiting period to pick up a newly purchased gun, Reid contended the delay saved lives. ""Sometimes people in a fit of passion purchase a handgun to do bad things with it -- even as my dad did, kill themselves,"" he said. ""Waiting a few days helps. Requiring a simple background check every time a gun is sold is common sense."" If Republicans managed to filibuster the full gun package, Reid said later that he would find a way to introduce each component individually to force votes. ""It will take a little bit of time but as I've said for months now, the American people deserve a vote -- on background checks, on federal trafficking, on safety in schools, on the size of clips, and yes - assault weapons."" Biden sounded incredulous that Senate Republicans would consider blocking full consideration of legislation that matters to so many Americans, as demonstrated by polls that indicate overwhelming support across the spectrum for expanded background checks. For Gabby Giffords, a wounded life has a new purpose . ""A tragedy that traumatized a nation and caught the attention of the entire world ... and the climax of this tragedy could be we're not even going to get a vote?"" Biden said, adding ""I just don't believe they'll do this."" Keene and other opponents worry that an expanded background check system would create a paper trail that could eventually be used to create a national gun registry, which they reject as unconstitutional. They also contend it would prove a burden to law-abiding gun owners while doing nothing to stop criminals from getting hold of firearms. ""The one thing you know today is that if the government creates a record, it's not secure,"" Keene said, adding that requiring background checks on all gun sales -- the so-called universal system -- raised the question of ""is it linked to a national registration scheme."" However, Biden accused the NRA of spreading false information that the proposed legislation would intrude on Second Amendment rights. Some states already have passed stricter gun laws similar to the federal proposals since the Newtown shootings. They include Connecticut, where the killings occurred, and Colorado, the site of two other notorious mass shootings that contributed to a renewed gun debate in America. From gun hater to NRA-loving mom . The current background check system was created in 1989. It requires federally approved gun dealers to check whether gun buyers have a criminal background or other problem to make them ineligible to purchase a firearm. Under the system, the gun dealer maintains a record of the transaction, but the federal government keeps no such identifying paperwork. According to a Justice Department report, less than 2% of those seeking to purchase firearms were denied due to background checks from 1998 through 2009. Opponents cite that figure as evidence that the system fails to stop illegal weapons sales that the legislation seeks to target, while supporters say the result shows the system keeps some guns out of the hands of the wrong people and the system should be expanded and strengthened. A Congressional Research Service report last November cited a government report that showed 9,903 of the 14,612 homicides in the nation in 2011 involved firearms. CNN's Ted Barrett, Todd Sperry, Joe Johns, Ashley Killough and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","NEW: Key senator says agreement close on bipartisan proposal .

"(CNN)  -- Manuel Neuer captained Schalke 04 to the German Cup with a 5-0 rout of second-flight Duisberg while earlier Saturday Celtic salvaged their season with a 3-0 win over Motherwell to claim the Scottish equivalent. Goalkeeper Neuer, linked with a move to Bavarian giants Bayern Munich and also English champions Manchester United, may have been playing in last game for Schalke, but had little to do in the Berlin Olympic stadium. Dutch international striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored either side of halftime after midfielder Julian Draxler put Schalke in front with a spectacular volley after being set up by Peru star Jefferson Farfan. Goals from Jose Jurado and defender Benedikt Hoewedes completed the rout for Schalke, who were beaten by Manchester United in the semifinals of the Champions League. Schalke's league form was poor as fellow Ruhr Valley side Borussia Dortmund took the title, but the Royal Blues have made partial amends in cup competitions. Celtic had been pipped for the Scottish title by arch-rivals Rangers but were too good for Motherwell at Hampden to give manager Neil Lennon his first piece of silverware since taking over. It extended their own record tally of 35 Scottish Cups, but was their first since 2007. South Korean international Ki Sung-Yeung put Celtic ahead on the half hour mark with a stunning shot from outside the area. Gavin Gunning hit the bar for Motherwell, who were finally undone by Stephen Craigan's cruel 76th minute own-goal. Charlie Mulgrew crashed home a free kick to seal Celtic's emphatic victory. It rounded off a bitter sweet season for Lennon, who has been the subject of death threats, parcel bombs and was attacked by a fan in Celtic's recent league game against Hearts. There had been doubts about his future at Celtic, but he told Sky Sports he would be discussing his future with their board next week. ""This is the first trophy, I'm so proud of them today. ""(But) I want the big one (the SPL title) on the CV, the sooner the better,"" he told Sky Sports.

"(CNN) -- The first anniversary of the Egyptian revolution is today. Egyptian society and the forces in Egypt are in a state of anticipation. World media has its cameras and correspondents in Cairo and major cities around the country. But many Egyptians wonder if the revolution amounted to nothing more than a military coup. It has been a year since the eruption of the first Egyptian revolution that stunned the world and ended 30 years of authoritarian, oppressive and corrupt rule by Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's last pharaoh. Mubarak ended up in jail along with his sons and his regime's major figures, with stories of their unimaginable corruption, brutality and looting surfacing ever since. But since then, most Egyptians have become angry and frustrated with the performance of the Military Council -- comprising more than a dozen elderly generals -- that has taken control. Egyptians, political forces and revolutionaries accuse the Military Council of being accomplices with the remnants of the Mubarak regime and of refusing to enact real reform, to the point of actually waging a counter-revolution. Egyptians have been enraged by the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations that followed the revolution, and in the arrests, humiliations and even killings of protesters. The Military Council is still controlling the state media and the political scene. Western governments and human rights organizations are expressing their dismay, with Human Rights Watch reporting killings and brutal attacks, some of them sexual, on protesters. The council is the Old Guard, desperately trying to preserve the military's long-standing privileges and special status. The military has been running Egypt since 1952 -- with rulers such as Gen. Mohammed Naguib, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat, Mubarak and Marshal Tantawy coming from its ranks. The military has dominated Egypt's modern political scene, with members serving as presidents, prime ministers, Cabinet ministers, governors, party elites, heads of the security services, ambassadors, heads of many companies, and even ministers of culture and the media -- in a true Orwellian fashion. The military institution in Egypt consumes more than 25% of the government expenditure and owns about 30% of the national economy. The United States has given Egypt a hefty military aid package of billions of dollars for nearly three decades. Egyptians respect their armed forces, but are desperate for a civil state where human rights, rights of minorities, and accountability and transparency are guaranteed. They do not want another pharaoh-like president coming from that institution. Egyptians have been asked to commemorate the special occasion of the revolution's first anniversary by taking to the streets Wednesday, wearing black in mourning of the deaths of hundreds of the revolution's martyrs. But some political forces refuse to call it a celebration -- they say the revolution is not finished and their demands have not been met. Demonstrators have already started to pour into Tahrir Square. Activists are calling for the immediate transition of power from the Military Council to a civilian council, or even an interim caretaker. Now, after bringing down the Mubarak regime and his notorious State Security apparatus, Egyptians have broken the fear barrier and believe there is no turning back. Will they stun the world again, with Egyptian Revolution, Part II? Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter. Join the conversation on Facebook.

"London (CNN) -- Amanda Levete's north London office is nestled between a giant prison and a handful of industrial units. It's an unassuming HQ for woman responsible for such ground-breaking buildings as the Lord's Media Center and the upcoming 140,000 square-meter Bangkok Central Embassy. ""I like the fact that it doesn't look like an architect's office from the outside,"" said Levete. ""I choose to be in an edgy area where there are no other architects."" However, once inside the warehouse-like building, there's no doubt you've come to the right place. The vast open plan interior is dotted with cardboard architects' models in glass cabinets. There's a thick red carpet and the 50-odd staff and visitors leave shoes at the door to pad around in socks or bare feet. The wisdom of women: Whose words inspire you? Levete, 57, has had offices here for a year. Four years ago, she set up her own practice after the death of her former husband, with whom she had worked for 20 years. On the day we meet, Levete has just flown back from Portugal where she was talking about one of her latest projects, a new cultural center in a former industrial area on the banks of the river in Lisbon. ""It's about regenerating the riverfront, but we need to connect it back to the city, both literally, conceptually and socially,"" she said. ""We have created public spaces on the roof and in front of the building, so the roof will be a destination itself. ""Public spaces for me are a very important aspect of architecture, where people meet and ideas are exchanged that drive society forward."" Levete went to a top independent school in London, but left at the age of 16, planning to go to art college. ""I was quite independent at 16,"" she said. ""I was quite impetuous, I never felt daunted. ""If my children decided to leave school at 16, I would find that difficult as a parent, but I didn't ask my parents' opinion. It wasn't up for debate."" While doing a foundation art course, Levete became interested in architecture and acquired the A-level qualifications she needed. ""I started reading about art history and discovered architecture,"" she said. ""It hadn't crossed my radar before."" Also on Leading Women: Arianna Huffington tells women 'Less stress, more living' Early in her career, Levete worked for high profile British ""starchitects"" Richard Rogers and Will Alsop. In 1989, Levete joined the Czech architect Jan Kaplicky as a partner in his practice Future Systems, and shortly afterward they were married. During their 20-year partnership, Levete and Kaplicky worked on the unusual Media Center at Lord's Cricket Ground, a spaceship-like structure that appears to hover above the ground, and a new Selfridges department store in Birmingham. Lord's Media Center, the first all-aluminum building in the world, won a host of awards, including the Stirling Prize, Britain's most prestigious architectural prize, in 1999. ""It was probably the most complex and ground breaking project we will ever do,"" said Levete. ""It was built by a boat builder, but 12 meters in the air, rather than upside down in a boat yard. ""The MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club), who were our clients, were one of the great bastions of the British establishment, taking on a very radical building, so there were tensions."" While working on Lord's Media Centre, Levete had her son Josef, taking no time off for maternity leave. ""I was doing the competition report in hospital,"" she said. ""It was ridiculous, but it was worth it. It was tough, but I was so high from having a baby and doing the competition, that I just got on with it. I was extremely tired for many years."" Their next big project was a new Selfridges store in Birmingham, England, in 2003, winning multiple awards for its faÃ§ade of aluminum discs and becoming a landmark of the city. ""The building has become completely synonymous with Birmingham. It's a powerful piece of iconography and people go just to ride on the escalators as well as to shop,"" said Levete. Read more: The woman using social media to predict the future . Levete and Kaplicky eventually divorced, but continued to work together until his sudden death in Prague in 2009, albeit with a strained relationship towards the end. ""Jan and I almost had two offices for some time,"" said Levete. ""The people working with me stayed with me, and the people working with him would have gone with him if he had not died."" After Kaplicky's death, Levete set up her own practice, AL_A with four other directors. ""The change happened under traumatic circumstances,"" she said. ""It was a very difficult time and I underestimated how difficult the transition would be. ""We had a significant reputation as Future Systems, and starting AL_A, we had that as our heritage but not our future. ""It took a good two or three years for the office to bed down and establish its own identify."" AL_A is now thriving. In addition to the Lisbon cultural center, and a 140,000 square-meter hotel and shopping center in Bangkok, Levete was chosen in 2012 as the winning design for a new underground extension to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. ""We are creating a vast courtyard in front of the building, it's going to be the first porcelain courtyard,"" said Levete. ""It will be like an outdoor room where people can meet and hang out, so they can delay the decision to enter the museum."" On several occasions, Levete has collaborated with the Indian-born British sculptor Anish Kapoor, including on a design for a new subway station in Naples. Despite 10 years of work, this is now on hold after the contractor building it went bankrupt. Amanda Levete is a judge for the Designs of the Year Award.

"(CNN) -- The United States will talk to North Korea, but only if the country gets serious about negotiating the end of its nuclear weapons program, Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday during a visit to South Korea, a key U.S. ally. ""North Korea will not be accepted as a nuclear power,"" Kerry said after arriving in Seoul. His trip to South Korea -- part of an Asian swing that also includes North Korean ally China -- came a day after a Pentagon intelligence assessment surfaced suggesting North Korea may have developed the ability to fire a nuclear-tipped missile at its foes. Disclosed first by a congressman at a hearing Thursday and then confirmed to CNN by the Defense Department, the Defense Intelligence Agency assessment is the clearest acknowledgment yet by the United States about potential advances in North Korea's nuclear program. Despite weeks of bellicose rhetoric from Pyongyang threatening nuclear attacks on the United States, South Korea and their allies, U.S. officials have characterized the North's saber rattling as largely bluster. U.S. officials think North Korea could test-launch a mobile ballistic missile at any time in what would be seen by the international community as a highly provocative move. But a senior administration official said there's no indication that any such missiles are armed with nuclear material. Still, the defense agency said it has ""moderate confidence"" that North Korea could fit a nuclear weapon on a ballistic missile and fire it. But agency analysts think such a missile's reliability would be low -- an apparent reference to its accuracy. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Friday that the North Korean government ""has not demonstrated the capability to deploy a nuclear-armed missile."" And Kerry said Friday that it would be inaccurate to suggest that North Korea, which has conducted three underground nuclear weapons tests since 2006, can launch a nuclear-armed missile, despite the DIA assessment. ""But obviously they have conducted a nuclear test, so there's some kind of device, but that is very different from miniaturization and delivery and from tested delivery and other things,"" he said. He said any launch by North Korea would be a ""huge mistake."" ""If Kim Jong Un decides to launch a missile, whether it's across the Sea of Japan or in some other direction, he will be choosing willfully to ignore the entire international community, his own obligations that he has accepted, and it will be a provocative and unwanted act that will raise people's temperature with respect to this issue,"" Kerry said. South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, speaking with Kerry at a Friday news conference, urged North Korea to open talks. ""We urge North Korea to cease its reckless behavior and to stop issuing threats,"" he said. ""Instead, we urge North Korea to respond to our call for building trust on the Korean Peninsula through dialogue, and now it is time for North Korea to make that choice."" A joint statement issued by South Korea and the United States before Kerry's departure emphasized Washington's commitment to defending Seoul ""in the wake of recent unacceptable provocations"" by the North. ""The United States stands vigilantly by the Republic of Korea's side, and is prepared for and capable of defending and protecting itself and its allies,"" the statement read. Kerry now plans to visit China and tell leaders there that Pyongyang, as one senior administration official said, is ""putting China's own interests at risk."" Washington wants Beijing to ""stop the money trail into North Korea"" and to carry a strong message to the North that getting rid of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula is China's goal, said the official and a senior State Department official. Defense Intelligence Agency report . The surprising Defense Intelligence Agency assessment of North Korea's potential nuclear capabilities emerged during Thursday's House Armed Services Committee hearing. At the hearing, Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colorado, read from a declassified version of the document in which the DIA expresses ""moderate confidence the North currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles, however, the reliability will be low."" As Kerry did Friday, top officials in Washington tried Thursday to downplay concerns about the report. Pentagon spokesman George Little said that ""it would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced"" in the DIA study. That stance was echoed by James R. Clapper, director of U.S. national intelligence, who said: ""North Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear-armed missile."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the agency has no independent information to verify the DIA's assessment. The DIA has been wrong in the past, producing an assessment in 2002 that formed the basis for arguments that Iraq had nuclear weapons -- a view later found to be incorrect . Confusion over intel's release . The report was ""mistakenly"" marked as declassified, according to an administration and a defense source. A House Armed Services Committee aide said staffers checked with the DIA to confirm that the passage was not classified before Lamborn read it. Lamborn told CNN's ""AC360"" that he acted properly in disclosing it during the hearing. ""Given the seriousness of the threat, this is something that I think people do need to know about,"" he said. On Friday, Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, also backed disclosure of the assessment. ""I have to believe they know what they're doing,"" said McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. ""I think it's good for the American people to understand how tenuous this situation is and how important it is for us to have a strong defense."" North Korean missile adjustments . On Thursday, North Korea briefly raised a missile into an upright firing position, stoking concerns that a launch was imminent, a U.S. official told CNN. Later, another U.S. official said it had been tucked back into its launcher. That could signify that a much-feared launch by the North is less imminent. It could also mean the government was testing the equipment. The first U.S. official cautioned that raising the untested Musudan missile, which South Korea says has a range of up to 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers), could have been just a trial run or an effort to ""mess"" with the United States and its allies. North Korea's missile capabilities . The believed range means the Musudan could reach Guam, a Western Pacific territory that is home to U.S. naval and air bases, and where the United States recently said it was placing missile defense systems. The United States and South Korean militaries have been monitoring the movements of mobile ballistic missiles on the east coast of North Korea. Japan has deployed defense systems. Clapper, the national intelligence director, said Thursday at a House Intelligence Committee hearing that he didn't think Kim had ""much of an endgame"" other than to get recognition from the world as a nuclear power, which ""entitles him to negotiation, accommodation and, presumably, aid."" He reiterated that the nation's ""nuclear weapons and missile programs pose a serious threat to the United States and to the security environment in East Asia."" Opinion: Why North Korea worries Dick Cheney . More threats . North Korea denied responsibility in a wave of cyberattacks on tens of thousands of computers at South Korean banks and broadcasters last month, the North's state news agency, KCNA, reported Friday. South Korea this week accused the North of carrying out the March 20 attacks. An official South Korean investigation found that many of the malignant codes employed in the attacks were similar to ones used previously by the North, said Lee Seung-won, an official at the South Korean science ministry. A spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army said the allegations are ""groundless"" and ""a deliberate provocation to push the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an extreme phase,"" according to KCNA. Friday, North Korea also issued a scathing warning to Japan, saying via KCNA that Tokyo should ""stop recklessly working for staging a comeback on Korea, depending on its American master."" Japanese foreign minister spokesman Masaru Sato said such remarks only hurt North Korea. ""Japan would not be pushed around by rhetoric of North Korea,"" he said. Late Friday, Japan's Transport Ministry issued a notice requiring Japanese airplanes to report to the U.S. military if they fly near the U.S. military's Kadena base in Okinawa prefecture, the Kyodo News Agency said. The notice, made at the request of the U.S. military in Japan, is believed to be part of precautions taken against possible North Korean missile launches. It concerns the airspace within 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) of the base in southern Japan, where Patriot missiles are deployed. War of words escalates: Timeline of a crisis . North Korea began to sharpen its threats in February, after the United Nations reacted to the country's third nuclear test with tougher sanctions. Annual military exercises involving U.S. and South Korean troops have added to the tensions. At the Thursday House Intelligence Committee hearing, Clapper said the United States believed the primary objective of Kim's bellicose rhetoric was to ""consolidate and affirm his power."" Earlier in the crisis, the United States drew attention to shows of strength, such as practice missions by B-2 stealth bombers. Should I stay or should I go? Expats mull future there . Kerry said Friday that U.S. officials were working to calm the crisis, noting President Barack Obama had canceled some of the exercises.

"(CNN) -- As Co-Chairman of Universal Pictures, Donna Langley is one of an elite club: A female movie mogul in Hollywood. And holding one of the most sought-after jobs in the industry comes with responsibility, in Langley's eyes. Part of her role, she says, is mentoring the next generation of young women who've set their sights on working in the movies -- helping them to set realistic expectations in an industry built on bringing fantasies to life. That way, they ""don't waste a lot of time on ... dreaming about doing something that is not realistic or doesn't exist,"" said Langley, adding that she directs them ""toward some of the real opportunities that are actually there in the business."" Langley joined Universal Pictures in 2001 as Senior Vice President of Production, then became President of Production where she oversaw hits including ""It's Complicated"" and ""Mamma Mia."" In 2009 she was promoted to Co-Chairman and now works with Chairman Adam Fogelson on the studio's business and production strategies. A large part of her job is ""running a business"" and mitigating problems such as the decline of the DVD market in the face of Netflix and video on demand. The brains behind the most viral ad ever . But what really fills her with passion is the creative part of the job. ""I just love being at the heart of the creative process. You know being somebody who facilitates a creative vision and a dream and creating movies, stories for people all around the world,"" she said. Here she talks to CNN's Leading Women about being adopted, holding down her demanding job as a mother of two, and what it's really like in Hollywood. On self-belief ... I am the only one in my family who is adopted. It always made me feel really special. I felt like I was chosen. I think it made me have a sense of sort of being able to deal with any situation. I think dealing with something like that at a very young age and having an understanding that those kinds of things happen in the world made me ... believe in myself and believe that anything is possible. On rising through the ranks in a male-dominated business ... I think women have a unique way of multi-tasking and being sort of the ultimate diplomats and those are two skills that come in really handy in our business. We are dealing with different situations and artistic and creative people ... who need some real TLC sometimes. It doesn't (feel like a man's world) to me. I think it's because I am surrounded by great and fabulous women. You are never going to get validation, the amount of validation that you sometimes need from other people. And even though you may get it, you can't rely upon it. You have to have that inner strength. On putting off a family until after 40 ... I think I am a better mother having done it a little bit later in life and having got to a point where my career was really on solid footing. How Cirque du Soleil scouts clowns, trapeze artists and gymnasts . On juggling work and family life ... I had to figure out how to leave my work at work. I realized that all of the experience that I had and all of the expertise that I brought to the table every day gave me a certain confidence to just kind of let go and not sweat the small stuff and really just ... be able to look at the big picture and manage. It is difficult. I think as women we carry a huge amount of guilt every second of every day we are not with our children. I hope ultimately that they would have pride in the fact that they have a mother who loves what she does and goes to work every day happy. But ... it does it requires a huge amount of organization and prioritization. And you know I am very fortunate that I have an incredibly supportive husband. On commercial movies ... I think that there is ... a conception out there that those films -- because they are so commercial and because they are required to be commercial -- can't be creative. But I actually disagree with that. Their reach is really worldwide. The ... visual effects component of those films is exciting to moviegoers all over the world. So, that's definitely a kind of movie making that is absolutely imperative to the studios. On Hollywood ... There is a superficial side to it ... We are all creating a fantasy after all, every day. That is what we do. But the people behind the scenes, they are people who are going to work every day ... these are all people who are so passionate about what they are doing.","Donna Langley is Co-Chairman of Universal Pictures .

"(CNN) -- Should the press be more heavily regulated? Share your thoughts here. Could the phone-hacking scandal prove to be a blessing in disguise for Rupert Murdoch? A year ago that would have seemed a ridiculous notion. News Corp.'s UK newspaper arm almost collapsed last summer under the weight of a story that dominated Britain's news agenda for months, prompting a sting of resignations and a high-profile public inquiry. It was a conflagration that briefly threatened to engulf the entire company, forcing a fire-fighting Rupert Murdoch to appear before British lawmakers in London and declare: ""This is the most humble day of my life."" Yet since News Corp. responded to the crisis by confirming in the spring it would spin off its publishing assets into a separate company, the media conglomerate's stock has soared. News Corp.'s share price has risen by 20% since July 2011, adding more than $5 billion to the value of the company. Insiders say executives are surprised by the positive way Wall Street received its decision to hive off its print titles. They shouldn't be. The phone-hacking scandal, which resulted in the closure of UK Sunday tabloid News of the World, forced Murdoch to do what frustrated investors had been urging him to do for years: jettison the company's troublesome newspaper titles, which include the Times of London and the Sun. The surge in the company's share price reflects optimism about the future of the company once it is freed from the deadweight of print in 2013. The Wall Street Journal, which News Corp. also owns, is profitable because it has figured out a way to make money online by charging for content, but other titles are struggling. Shareholders in the U.S. have long viewed Murdoch's attachment to his London-based papers, in particular, as an expensive indulgence. They approve of News Corp.'s renewed focus on broadcasting, a part of the media industry that is growing. Murdoch has spent money taking full control of Australia's largest pay-TV operator and acquiring the local network that screens New York Yankees games. Cable TV veteran Chase Carey, a reassuring presence, is firmly established as Murdoch's second in command. The constant chatter about which member of the Murdoch family will be shoe-horned into the CEO's chair to succeed the old man has fallen quiet, at least for now. A Management and Standards Committee set up to deal with the fallout from the phone-hacking affair has been cooperating with Scotland Yard, uncovering evidence of illegal payments to public officials, but its work is nearly complete. It feels as if the company might finally be putting phone-hacking behind it. Murdoch is enthused about the creation of ""pubco"" and bullish about its prospects, convinced there is still plenty of money to be made in print. A senior company source describes him as ""obsessed"" with the business. He is planning a spending spree once the company is established, and is busy finalizing a string of executive appointments. The company is expected to be run by Robert Thomson, an Australian who once edited the Times of London and now runs the Journal, and there is talk of bringing forward the stock market flotation. The business has recovered its momentum and Murdoch has rediscovered his mojo. His frequent and combative tweets, covering subjects from British press regulation to China's uncertain future, is testament to that. Yet those who regard the 81-year-old's enthusiasm for newspapers as an enduring weakness may ultimately be proved right. The new publishing business will be given a large amount of cash by News Corp., a generous dowry to ensure a good start in life, cash that shareholders may feel would be more effectively deployed elsewhere. It is believed Murdoch tried to persuade his oldest son Lachlan to return to the family fold as chief executive of the publishing business, a reminder that succession is the thorniest issue of all at News Corp. His second son James, who was badly damaged by the phone-hacking affair, is quietly running Fox Networks in the U.S. and reporting directly to Carey, but no one doubts his father wants him to run the company when he finally steps aside. That could prompt a showdown with investors that Murdoch Sr. may no longer be strong enough to win. Phone-hacking damaged Murdoch and the specter of an FBI investigation into alleged payments to foreign officials, a criminal offense under the Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act, still casts a long shadow over News Corp. The company has not commented on any potential investigation. The most likely outcome is a settlement with the U.S. authorities that will cost the company millions of dollars, but it would be wrong to assume the hacking saga will end there. In April last year, James Murdoch, who was then in charge of News Corp.'s European and Asian businesses, told a conference the company had successfully put phone-hacking ""in a box."" Three weeks later, three of Murdoch's key executives had resigned and the News of the World had been dramatically shuttered. Murdoch has not been held personally responsible for phone-hacking but further criticism could undermine his authority. The Leveson Inquiry is critical of the News of the World and says there was a failure of governance at News International. But it also says there is no evidence Rupert Murdoch knew phone-hacking was rife, or that he orchestrated a cover-up. Leveson is less equivocal about James Murdoch, saying there are aspects of his evidence ""that cause me some concern"". It stops short of criticizing the younger Murdoch further, citing ongoing police investigations into criminality at News International, but the verdict is not a favorable one for James, and it may harm his chance of succeeding his father. That is unwelcome news for Rupert, who desperately wants to keep his business empire in the family. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Robinson.","Rupert Murdoch claimed to have been ""humbled"" by the phone-hacking scandal .

"(CNN) -- Law enforcement agents began searching the Connecticut home of an alleged mobster on Thursday. But the suspect's attorney says authorities are actually hunting for hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen art that went missing from a Boston museum more than 20 years ago. Ryan McGuigan, an attorney for Robert Gentile, a 76-year-old Connecticut man facing federal drug charges and illegal firearms possession, said it's the second time authorities have scoured the man's home. ""Pursuant to the search warrant, they are looking for firearms,"" said McGuigan. ""But they're not really looking for firearms. They're looking for $500 million in (art stolen) from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum on March 18, 1990."" Pieces by Rembrandt and Degas were among the artworks stolen in the notorious heist. The U.S. Attorney's office declined to comment on the apparent search. Manchester Police spokesman Chris Davis said law enforcement agents were at the scene and that the FBI had been requested. In an earlier statement, the museum said it ""does not have any comments about the Robert Gentile case in Connecticut."" ""The Museum continues to offer a $5 million reward for information leading to the recovery of the artworks in good condition,"" the statement read. ""Anyone with information about the theft, the location of the stolen artworks, and/or the investigation, should contact the Gardner Museum."" Hours after St. Patrick's Day festivities wrapped up in Boston on March 18, 1990, two men dressed as police officers knocked on the museum's side security entrance. Upon entering, the intruders handcuffed the security guards, bound them with duct tape and left them in the basement, authorities said at the time. In less than 90 minutes, the bandits went through the museum's Dutch Room on the second floor and stole three Rembrandts, including the Dutch artist's only seascape, ""Storm on the Sea of Galilee,"" along with Vermeer's ""The Concert,"" five Degas drawings and other items, according to the museum's website. The thieves also apparently tried to steal a fourth Rembrandt but were unsuccessful, the FBI reported at the time. The agency said that their early investigation led authorities to examine several different groups, including members of Boston's organized crime gangs and the Irish Republican Army. CNN's Jake Carpenter contributed to this report.","Authorities search the home of alleged mobster .

"(CNN) -- The largest case of bank fraud in Iranian history is threatening to engulf President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad after a parliamentary commission decided to investigate his office for possible connections to the crime, Iranian state media has reported. To add insult to injury, Islamist hard-line legislators loyal to Iran's Supreme Leader, the Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, subsequently sent the commission a letter requesting specifically that Ahmadinejad be included in the investigation. They have since said they would not follow up on the letter out of respect for Khamenei. It is one move of many by Islamists to link the president to the alleged embezzlement of 30 trillion Iranian rials -- more than $2.5 billion. To frame the extent of allegations in U.S. terms: It would be akin to religious conservative legislators attempting to implicate a sitting American president in the infamous Madoff Ponzi scheme, in which disgraced financier Bernie Madoff cheated investors out of $50 billion. Ahmadinejad has vehemently rejected accusations that anyone in his government is linked to what is currently the highest-profile crime in the country, according to the semi-official Mehr News Agency. ""The government had no role in this affair and the banking system itself discovered the fraud,"" Ahmadinejad said in a televised interview Tuesday, according to Mehr. Two Iranian economists who spoke to CNN alluded to political opportunism in the accusations against the president and people close to him. But both believe politicians were involved, possibly even directly. The size and nature of the fraud required ""a trend inside the government to make this problem and this scandal,"" said Tehran economic analyst Saeed Laylaz. A second economist points out that the main suspect in the case has ties to the Iranian president's chief adviser, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who used his influence in a bank business deal for the accused man, Amir Mansoor Khosravi. Khosravi had opened a private bank known as the Bank Arya. Getting a license is usually difficult, but Mashaei used his political pull to help pave the way, said economist Dr. Behrooz Hady Zonooz from Tehran. ""More than ten times he has written letters to bank persons,"" said Zonooz, who spoke with banking officials about the founding of the bank. A former professor of economics, Zonooz now runs a development consultancy and has closely followed the embezzlement case. He has also spoken to officials close to it and been allowed to see some of the bank data firsthand. Mashaei and Khosravi also both come from the same province, said Zonooz. Mashaei, the president's adviser as well as a close personal friend, is also a thorn in the side of Islamist politicians loyal to Khamenei. Hardliners have long called for Mashaei's dismissal, but Ahmadinejad has held fast to his loyal friend, with whom he now has family ties. In 2008, Mashaei's daughter married Ahmadinejad's eldest son. Mashaei has regularly rankled the religious right with conciliatory tones toward Israel and the United States -- moves considered serious gaffes in Iran -- and his habit of shaking hands with women in formal settings, which is considered culturally impolite by many in Iranian society and thought to be indecent by the religious right. In defense of softer comments toward the United States and Israel, Mashaei has explained to Iranian state TV: ""My statement was that we, the Iranian people, are friends of the whole wide world, even the people of Israel and America. There is no reason for us not to be friends. I did not deny making that statement, and I am not denying it now."" Bold words for a presidential adviser in Iran. Khamenei has rebutted Mashaei's statements as not reflecting Iran's position. Mashaei's praise for historic heroes of pre-Islamic times, when Zoroastrianism -- now a minority faith -- was the religion of the land, has particularly offended Islamist politicians. Even though the Iranian bank fraud, which made use of illegitimate letters of credit, encompasses a much smaller amount of money than the Madoff Ponzi scheme did, it is at least twice the size when compared to Iran's GDP, according to Zonooz. ""It is about 0.8% of GDP,"" he said. ""If you measure it by the outstanding loans of the banking system to the private sector, it is about 1% of the outstanding loans."" In other words, 100 such scams ""could take all of the banking system."" The crime involves at least seven banks, Press TV has reported, including two major financial institutions, Bank Sederat and Bank Melli. ""Bank Melli Iran is the biggest banking system in the Islamic world,"" said Laylaz. ""It is very big and the oldest bank in the country. This bank has suffered a lot."" Rhetoric linking the embezzlement to the president's office is as old as the scandal itself. A conservative Islamist newspaper, Kayhan, has been widely credited for bringing the fraud to light, when it reported financial misappropriations and other shady dealings in June in an article headlined ""The Weeds."" The article alleged involvement of people close to Ahmadinejad, whom hardliners have labeled the ""deviant current"" for their departure from the righteous principals of Islam in society, politics and economics -- people associated with Ahmadinejad's friend and adviser Mashaei. ""We hope that the respected president will take out the members of this deviant band like weeds and throw them out of the garden of government,"" the article stated, addressing Ahmadinejad. The ""deviant current"" label has become a well-established political slight in Iranian state media. The criminal investigation of the embezzlement has lead to 22 arrests and the resignation of three of Iran's highest banking officials, according to state-run Press TV. The head of Bank Melli fled the country for Canada in late September, Press TV reported. CNN found his name and address on the Internet in a cached view of an Iranian business contact website in Toronto. The phone numbers and website listed did not work. The embezzlement case was referred to the courts in August, Press TV said. Although they have faced criticism in state media, members of the government had not previously been subjects of the bank fraud investigation. But then in first days of October, a commission charged with investigating illegal activity in the judicial and executive branches -- which would include the office of the president -- called up evidence in the case, according to Press TV, in order to scrutinize it for any involvement in the fraud by members of the government. On October 3, 11 Islamist members of parliament sent a letter to the Article 90 Commission of the Majlis --- Majlis is the name for Iran's parliament -- demanding that Ahmadinejad be included in their investigation, Mehr News Agency reported. The Mehr article pointed out that just enough parliamentarians accused the president or ministers to require that the matter be immediately investigated. A day later, the hardliners announced they would not follow up on their letter, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency, out of respect after Khamenei said that ""an atmosphere of calm is needed in order for this case to be investigated."" The Mehr article detailed the complicated parliamentary procedure that could lead to the president's impeachment, which includes at least three rounds of voting. The Mehr News Agency is belongs to the hardline Islamic Propagation Organization. On the same day, Mehr published an article in which Khamenei called for the strictest of punishment for those convicted, urging judicial officials to ""cut off the hands of the traitors."" Corruption is rampant in Iran, and political involvement in it is commonplace, leaving politicians no lack of scandals of which to accuse their opponents, says economist Zonooz. ""Always there has been corruption in the government -- different sectors -- and everybody knows it, but recently, because the rivalry for the next election has increased, they're trying to use these as a tool against their rival groups,"" he said. Transparency International gives Iran the same grade on corruption as Haiti, the Ivory Coast and Libya. The theocratic regime stands near the bottom of TI's rating list -- number 146 out of 178 nations. Pakistan, Nigeria and Zimbabwe come away better. Fighting corruption is a common mantra espoused by Iran's political leaders. But they are failing, according to economist Laylaz, and should be held responsible, although he does not name specific government officials. ""The most important thing for politics, for the government, for the judiciary system is that we create an atmosphere in which corruption cannot occur, cannot appear,"" Laylaz said. ""They brought this atmosphere, and in my opinion, they are responsible for this disaster."" Although this bank fraud is the largest in the county's history, Laylaz believes that it represents less than a quarter of current such crimes in his country. And it will not harm Iran's economy, he said. ""From an economic point of view, it is not so significant. It will not affect the economy of the country. But from a psychological point of view, it affects very much,"" he explained. Zonooz agreed, and said that the seized assets of those arrested will more than cover the economic damage the embezzlement caused. Most of the embezzled money was used to buy companies from the government, he added, placing it into the country's economy and government coffers. Ahmadinejad's opponents did not conspire to concoct a presidential scandal out of the bank fraud, Zonooz believes. ""There was no plot, but the timing of this discovery and the intentions of the government authorities is meaningful,"" the economist said. Religious ultra-conservative politicians seeking leverage against Ahmadinejad to force him to fall in line with the country's supreme leader now have the opportunity to associate him -- via his liberal friends -- with the worst embezzlement scandal in the country's history.","A close adviser to Ahmadinejad has links to the main suspect .

"Washington (CNN) -- Six of the nine Supreme Court justices attended the annual Red Mass at the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington on Sunday. The event's speakers spoke about using faith in decision-making but largely stayed away from the controversial issues the court will face in the coming months. Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Antonin Scalia, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Elena Kagan all attended the 60th annual Mass. This was Kagan's first Red Mass. Having six justices in attendance ties a record set in 2009. The only justices to not attend this year were Sonia Sotomayor and Samuel Alito, both of whom are Catholic, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is Jewish. Kagan and Breyer, both of whom were in attendance, are also Jewish. Election raise stakes for possible court vacancies . The annual Mass is an event put on by the Archdiocese of Washington and the John Carroll Society and aims to bring people together to pray for the members of the judiciary before the court begins hearing cases each year. It's called the Red Mass because of the color of the garments worn by clergy. In the past, presidents, vice presidents and many members of Congress and the judiciary have attended the event. Timothy P. Broglio, archbishop for members of the U.S. military, delivered this year's homily, expressing a commitment to the poor and to education while also strongly emphasizing the idea that people should strive to live their faith and become ""instruments of a new evangelization."" ""The faith we hold in our hearts must motivate the decisions, the words and the commitment of our everyday existence,"" said Broglio. ""Our society must also rest on stable, clear foundations. Otherwise, we run the risk of sinking into the mire of one popular soundbite after another."" Possible Romney court nominees . Speaking about the need to shed clearer light on the ""joy and renewed enthusiasm"" of the church, Broglio stressed the idea of living one's faith outside of church and in everyday life. ""We are instruments in the hands of the Lord, and so we pray to be ever open to his presence,"" said Broglio. ""The message is filled with hope: not only for eternal life, but also for the graces necessary so that our lives are truly noble of God and of the vocation he has given us."" While the Red Mass follows the traditional structure of a Catholic service, it also includes a few additions. In particular, the congregants sang ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" and ""America the Beautiful"" at the start and end of the Mass. Others attending the event included Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, Virginia attorney general and gubernatorial hopeful Ken Cuccinelli, and U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Dan Rooney. Possible Obama court nominees . The court's current religious makeup -- six Catholics and three Jews -- marks the first time there has been no Protestant justice on the highest court in the land. In 2010, Kagan replaced Justice John Paul Stevens, who was the lone Protestant at the time of his retirement. This is unique for a country in which every president has been Protestant except for John F. Kennedy, a Catholic. The mix of religion and government at the Red Mass has raised some eyebrows in the past. Ginsburg no longer attends the Mass because she said she grew tired of being lectured by Catholic officials. ""I went one year, and I will never go again, because this sermon was outrageously anti-abortion,"" Ginsburg said in the book ""Star of David: Prominent Jews Talk About Being Jewish."" ""Even the Scalias - although they're much of that persuasion --- were embarrassed for me."" Court opens possibly contentious new term . Critics of the service find the attendance of leading decision-makers to be inappropriate. ""There is one purpose to have this. It is to make clear ... just what the church hierarchy feels about some of the very issues that are to come before the court,"" said Rev. Barry Lynn, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. ""That is just wrong. And it is wrong for members to go --- not illegal --- but wrong for the archdiocese to promote and encourage this event."" While previous Masses have included political references --- in 2009, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo made an unspecified reference to the rights of the unborn --- this year's Mass was largely void of any hot-button political issues that the court might be addressing, like affirmative action, same-sex marriage, voting rights or abortion laws. The origins of the Red Mass date back to early Catholic times in cities like Rome, Paris and London. In Paris, La Sainte Chappelle was built and designated as a chapel specifically for Red Mass. In the United States, the tradition began in New York City in 1928, when a group of Catholic lawyers gathered in St. Andrew's Cathedral. CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report.","Six members of Supreme Court attend annual D.C. event .

"(CNN) -- Second terms, untainted by re-election posturing, often reveal a president's true governing philosophy. In the case of President Obama, two recent revelations have confirmed all we may need to know about his agenda for the next four years. On December 30, the president sat down for an interview with David Gregory on ""Meet the Press."" Gregory asked the president, ""So what is your single priority of the second term? What is the equivalent to health care?"" President Obama replied, ""Well, there are a couple of things that we need to get done. I've said that fixing our broken immigration system is a top priority. I will introduce legislation in the first year to get that done."" He went on to say, ""The second thing that we've got to do is to stabilize the economy and make sure it's growing."" During his first term in office, coming off ""the worst recession since the Great Depression,"" to use the president's own words, it appeared to many that he prioritized Obamacare over the economy. Now it appears that the economy, and all that goes along with it, like the ever-growing national debt, will again play second fiddle, this time to immigration reform. If priorities are any reflection of politics, it appears the president is more concerned with what he regards as historic, landmark legislation to build his legacy, rather than the economic well-being of the nation. If that seems like a harsh assessment, consider that just this week we learned from Stephen Moore's interview of House Speaker John Boehner in the Wall Street Journal that the president told Boehner during the fiscal cliff negotiations, ""We don't have a spending problem."" If $16 trillion of national debt and the huge deficits each year aren't spending problems, then what is? The United States most certainly has a spending problem. For the president to insist otherwise is dumbfounding but at the same time entirely consistent with his policies. He called for the Simpson-Bowles Commission on deficit reduction, but ignored their recommendations. He campaigned ad nauseam about the need for a balanced approach to deficit reduction, but the latest fiscal cliff deal is almost entirely tax hikes and even includes more stimulus spending. The only spending cuts he agreed to, the sequestration cuts, he had announced during one of the presidential debates ""will not happen."" There seems to be a near invincible unwillingness by this president and his advisors to cut the size and scope of government. How then do conservatives negotiate the coming debt ceiling extension, especially when they control neither the White House nor the Senate? There is no easy answer, but perhaps they should begin by explaining to the American people ""the politics of reality,"" as William Buckley aptly defined conservatism. The recent elections seem to indicate that a majority of the American people want lower taxes for themselves but approve of the president's increased spending programs. In the end, they cannot have both. A vibrant and prosperous private sector cannot coexist with a one-size-fits-all caretaker state. One relies on low taxes and limited government interference, the other on high taxes and government redistribution of resources. So Americans must choose between the two and conservatives must make that choice clear: higher taxes, higher spending and more government services, or opportunity and upward mobility with lower taxes and less government interference. The debt ceiling is just the first of many opportunities to bring this choice to the public. Republicans should make it clear that they will fulfill our debt obligations in a responsible manner, but they will only give the president short-term debt ceiling extensions until we get this problem under control. If Obama doesn't want to cut spending in a meaningful way he's going to have to explain that to the American people every couple of months for the next four years. The purpose isn't to thrash the president and his party or be ideological shock troops, as Ronald Reagan once warned against, but to hold a national education seminar on fiscal responsibility. Republicans have not won the argument, and will not win it, when these fiscal deals are made behind closed doors before the strike of midnight. Sunlight is the best disinfectant and so too in politics. Republicans can win the argument by making a clear and cogent public articulation of the president's spending problem and how the American people, especially the lower and middle classes, will be the ones to suffer as a result. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: National debt doesn't look like a priority for President Obama .

"(CNN) -- Marissa Mayer's announcement that Yahoo employees who work remotely must come in the office or quit has raised howls of criticism. Her supporters defend her decision by pointing out that many Yahoo workers who work at home never came in and hid from management, and that her decree is a wake-up call to get focused on teamwork and innovation so that the company can get up to speed. Mayer's reasoning makes some sense. But mandating face time will not automatically lead to creativity and collaboration. The key is establishing a culture of innovation and aligning talent and performance. Telework should not have to axed in the process. A work-at-home mom defends Yahoo's Mayer . Yahoo happens to be a case of an out-of-control, work-at-home company. It's telework gone horribly wrong. Telework, in itself, does not hurt productivity. But telework, when implemented poorly, can be a problem. Telework is just one out of many management tools designed to make a company more attractive for hardworking employees. Working from home doesn't necessarily hurt productivity. If management takes the time to implement it effectively and link it to accountability, then telework benefits both the company and employees. It can build trust and promote healthy work-life balance among employees. However, management must have the courage to get rid of deadwood and fire telework abusers. Employees commit to an organization because they buy into company goals and feel valued, not because they are ordered to sit at their desks. Yahoo may have long-term trust and morale issues if it continues this policy. Abolishing telework is like canceling the prom because some immature people spiked the punch bowl. It is not going to get Yahoo out of its doldrums. It may result in exodus, as talents leave for employers who do not see work-life flexibility at war with job performance. Opinion: CEO is right: Yahoo workers must show up . Mayer's calling all remote workers into the office raises some unspoken prevailing cultural assumptions. Workers who have control over where, when and how they work are often perceived as less productive. Giving workers flexibility to integrate personal life with work is viewed as antithetical to boosting performance. Yet studies have shown that all workers value control over personal and work time. This is not just a mom's child care issue or a dad's elderly care issue. It is a people issue. From millennials to Gen Xers to boomers, men to women, returning veterans to disabled employees -- having flextime and telework can make a huge difference in people's lives as they juggle work and life. Adapting to new ways of working is a competitive advantage in today's working environment. Organizations should realize that not everyone works best in the same way. Some people can handle text messages from work, family, news and Facebook 24/7. Others work better at 5 a.m. or late at night. And then there are people who desperately need time to focus and detach from work to get creative. Policy riles workers everywhere . Productivity does not equal face time. What remote workers should do is set clear performance goals and regular times for meetings and calls with core teams. Telework can build loyalty since employees can better manage their family life -- something that everyone can appreciate. And sometimes, they end up working more hours that they don't clock in. So when should a company draw a line on working remotely or in the office? When management is no longer sure who works for them or how to coordinate a team, and employees always place their own interests over the company. Yahoo needs to ask employees how to improve productivity and creativity without having to sacrifice telework. Given that it's harder than ever nowadays to separate the boundary between work from life, does Yahoo really think that requiring that employees to work in the office is the right solution? Let's hope Mayer's decision is temporary. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Ellen Ernst Kossek.","Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer told employees that they must work in the office or quit .

"(CNN) -- The vast majority of women in the United States use birth control. Some of us may even consider it a minor annoyance. Sometimes we forget to take our pills. The side effects can be painful. But we put up with it because it's so important to have the power to determine our future. I didn't fully appreciate how much contraceptives changed my life because I never lacked access to them. That is, I didn't fully appreciate them until I got involved in global health and learned that hundreds of millions of women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia don't have access to contraceptives. The lack of birth control is more than a minor annoyance. It can be a significant barrier to a better life. When I learned what many women in poor countries faced, I asked myself: What would my life have been like if I hadn't been able to use birth control? This week at the London Summit on Family Planning, a partnership of national governments from developing and developed countries, foundations, the private sector and NGOs is launching a groundbreaking effort to make sure no woman has to ask herself that question. Our goal is to make modern contraceptives and family planning information and services available to an additional 120 million women and girls in the world's poorest countries over the next eight years. I'm passionate about family planning because when I travel and talk to women in developing countries, what's universally clear is that they demand access to contraceptives. They want the power to determine their future. They know that when they can decide when they have children, they are healthier, their children are healthier, their families are more successful and their communities are more prosperous. Tragically, there are too many places where this virtuous cycle of social and economic development isn't happening. Nearly 13 million adolescent girls give birth each year in developing countries, typically before they are physically, emotionally or economically prepared. And when girls delay childbearing until their 20s, they are more likely to stay in school. Women who have been educated are likely to marry later, have healthier families and be able to invest in their children's education. Simply giving women the means to space the births of their children three years apart would decrease deaths of children 4 and younger by 25%. Already, there are a number of efforts underway that promise to give more women access to the lifesaving contraceptives they demand. In Senegal, we are investing in a pilot project to ensure that health clinics are always stocked with the full range of modern contraceptives, including implants, injectables and IUDs that put the power in the hands of women. Imagine what it would be like to travel for hours to a clinic for contraceptives, only to find that they are out of stock. I am excited to see that developing countries such as Senegal are investing in innovative programs to ensure that women will always have options when they go to the clinic. There is also important research underway on new health products that offer women even more options. I am enthusiastic about a new injectable device that women can administer themselves, so they don't have to travel to the clinic. In the United States, we administer our own birth control. It's hard to picture what it would be like if we had to see our doctor constantly to plan our families effectively. This new device will empower women in countries where the pill isn't popular to plan for themselves. Last year, I met with a group of women in Nairobi's Korogocho slum who talked openly about their family life and why they use birth control. After two hours, a woman named Mary Ann summed up the conversation with something I will never forget. She said: ""I want to bring every good thing to one child before I have another."" That single phrase captures the reason I am so deeply committed to family planning and why I am so enthusiastic about the London Summit. Bringing every good thing to our children starts with women everywhere being empowered to plan their family. On July 11, I hope you can tune in to witness the unprecedented commitments of all our partners and pledge your support for every woman and girl to have the opportunity to determine her own future.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Legendary pinup queen Bettie Page died of pneumonia at the age of 85 in a Los Angeles, California, hospital Thursday, a week after suffering a heart attack, according to her agent. Pinup queen Bettie Page was credited with helping to usher in the sexual revolution. ""She captured the imagination of a generation of men and women with her free spirit and unabashed sensuality,"" said agent Mark Roesler in a written statement. ""She is the embodiment of beauty."" Page, said to be one of the most photographed people of the past century, became a recluse in recent decades. Yet, her images continued to be used around the world to market Bettie Page action figures, clothing lines and other merchandise. ""Her popularity as an underground, guilty pleasures phenomenon has continued to soar despite the fact that the reclusive Page disappeared almost a half century ago, leading many to believe that one of the most photographed individuals of the 20th century was already dead."" Roesler said. The Web site, BettiePage.com, logs about 20 million hits a month, Roesler said. A TVGuide.com poll recently placed Bettie Page as the ""ultimate sex goddess,"" outscoring others such as Marilyn Monroe. iReport.com: Share your trubutes to Bettie Page . Page was born to a poor family in Tennessee on April 22, 1923. While her birth certificate spelled her name ""Betty,"" she changed the spelling later in life to ""Bettie."" At a time when few women pursued a college education, Page earned a bachelor of arts degree in education from Peabody College in Tennessee in 1944, according to her official biography. Her teaching career, however, was hampered by her looks, she said. ""I couldn't control my students, especially the boys,"" she is quoted as saying. After her modeling career ended, Page returned to Peabody College to work on a master's degree, the bio said. Her Southern drawl and a refusal to sleep with a Hollywood producer hampered her acting career, according to her bio. ""I didn't like his looks,"" Page said. ""I wouldn't have gone to bed with him anyway. He was a creep. He drove off in his big car and scolded me, 'You'll be sorry.' I wasn't."" Page said she regretted not accepting studio boss Jack Warner's offer of another screen-test, but it came while she was trying to save her marriage to her first husband, Billy Neal. Her modeling breakthrough began after she divorced Neal in 1947 when she met a police officer whose hobby was photography. He suggested the black bangs, which became her trademark, her bio said. Not long after, her images were everywhere, gracing magazine covers and locker pin-ups. Page wore nothing but a Santa hat in Playboy's January 1955 centerfold. Playboy founder Hugh Hefner said her appearance in his magazine's first year was a milestone. ""She became, in time, an American icon, her winning smile and effervescent personality apparent in every pose,"" Hefner said. ""A kinky connection was added by Irving Klaw's spanking, fetish and bondage photos, which became part of the Bettie Page mystique,"" Hefner said. ""They were playful parodies that are now perceived as the early inspiration for Madonna's excursions into the realm of sexual perversion."" Perhaps the most memorable photos of Page were her bondage poses, which she said were all pretend. ""I never understood how anyone believed those poses were sexy,"" she later said. ""To be tied up? I don't get it."" ""She was a remarkable woman, truly someone that changed the social norms, not only here in this country, but also around the world,"" Roesler said. ""While Jackie Robinson was changing the racial attitudes, Bettie Page was changing our attitudes on sex. She became a James Dean type of 'rebel' figure as she allowed people to be less inhibited and look at sex in a different way."" Saucy photos of Paige in skimpy clothing or none at all helped to lead the way for the sexual revolution of the 1960s. Page suddenly disappeared from the scene in 1958. It was only decades later revealed that she re-emerged to explain that she underwent a religious conversion and moved to Florida. Her life took a dark turn starting in 1978 after her third marriage failed, Roesler said. Page went through ""some mental instability, violent mood swings, and serious trouble with the law"" and was eventually diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, according to her bio. Page reappeared in public in December 2003 for Playboy's 50th anniversary party, where she made a grand entrance with Anna Nicole Smith. It was the only time in the past 50 years that Page allowed her photograph to be taken, Roesler said. A private funeral service is planned for Tuesday. Page will buried at Westwood Cemetery in Los Angeles, just a few feet away from Monroe.","Pinup beauty Bettie Page dies at hospital a week after suffering heart attack .

"LILONGWE, Malawi (CNN) -- Like most African countries, Malawi has suffered from a severe shortage of nurses and key health workers. Godfrey Mdzudzuma, a nurse at Embangweni Mission Hospital, delivers a baby in the maternity ward. In the past, workers in the tiny southeast African nation of just 13 million inhabitants have been lured abroad by the promise of higher wages and better working conditions. But, the country best-known as the homeland of Madonna's adopted children now has another claim to fame: It has succeeding in halting -- at least for now -- its crippling brain drain of nurses. Malawi's solution? To expand educational opportunities for nurses at all levels and keep them out of poverty by paying modestly more money. Countries don't come much poorer than Malawi, but its healthcare system worked well back in the 1970s and early 1980s. When the former British colony gained independence in 1964, president Hastings Banda, himself a physician, maintained a high level of training for nurses that included teaching all classes in English. By the late 1990s, however, Malawi was reeling from the AIDS epidemic. As if that weren't bad enough, the government also had to cut spending on health care and education as a condition for getting help from the U.S. and other countries to liberalize its trade and economy. The publicly funded health system, on which more than 95 percent of Malawians still depend for treatment, quickly started to fall apart. Watch a report about the impact of Malawi's nursing shortage » . Registered nurses began leaving in droves. ""Every day I received reports from Nurses' Council that so many nurses are now at the airport,"" Ann Phoya, the former head of nursing services for all Malawi told CNN. ""It was obvious that we needed to do something drastic."" Phoya worked with others in Malawi's Ministry of Health (MOH) to come up with an emergency plan that focused on nurses as they provided most of the primary care. The MOH then applied for around $160 million (£100 million) in international funding for their six-year initiative, primarily from the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom. The money was to be used to pay higher salaries to nurses -- quite a radical move in global development as donors worry it is unsustainable in the long haul. However, the situation in Malawi was getting desperate. The gamble paid off: The number of registered nurses leaving Malawi fell from a high of 111 (the equivalent of two years of Malawi's entire nursing graduates) in 2001 to just six in the first half of 2008. Enrollment at Malawi's nursing schools jumped up by 50 percent. Success in one area has revealed a different problem -- that of an internal brain drain. As more international aid groups and universities set up health programs in Malawi, they are hiring nurses, all trained at Malawi taxpayer expense, away from publicly funded hospitals and clinics. The problem is even more acute in the rural areas, where most of Malawi's people live. Embangweni Mission Hospital in northern Malawi has a good reputation but is located at the end of a long, dusty road, far from major towns, let alone cities. ""Young nurses with families do not really want to work here,"" said Catherine Mzembe, head of nursing at Embangweni. ""The local market is very small and although the hospital has running water, that is not the case in many homes."" Even so, the hospital has made impressive strides in the past five years preserving mothers' lives during pregnancy, as well as cutting the number of deaths due to malaria among children and adults. And that is perhaps the most important lesson to draw from Malawi's efforts: it pays to look at how much has been accomplished with so little.","Malawi's innovative national program lifts nurses out of poverty .

"(CNN) -- In February 2002, when the Bush administration's campaign to win support for invading Iraq was gathering steam, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was asked at a news conference about insinuations that Saddam Hussein was in cahoots with al Qaeda, a collaboration for which there was no evidence. Rumsfeld's response may not have been illuminating, but it was certainly memorable. ""Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me,"" he said, ""because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns -- the ones we don't know we don't know."" As we approach the 10th anniversary of that invasion, Rumsfeld's musings provide a helpful reminder for members of the news media. When the next war debate comes, our first step ought to be to take careful stock of what we know and what we don't. Journalists regularly have to take crash courses in new subjects. When the economy imploded in 2008, many of us who write about public affairs found ourselves addressing economic matters in greater detail than ever before. To write intelligently about health care reform in 2009, you had to get up to speed on how things such as the health insurance market and Medicare work, and a hundred other details. When a new topic is inherently opaque -- such as the internal politics of a country most journalists could barely find on a map, or the complex consequences of starting a war in a region where U.S. foreign policy is widely reviled -- we should know more than ever about our own personal known unknowns and unknown unknowns. Opinion: Did Iraq War give birth to the Arab Spring? That didn't happen in 2002 and 2003. The campaign to sell the Iraq War was a carefully planned and skillfully executed propaganda effort, and it succeeded because so many journalists and news outlets went along for the ride. To be fair to the news media, they were up against an administration using diabolically clever techniques. To take just one example, in the fall of 2002, the administration leaked a story to The New York Times' Judith Miller claiming that Iraq had purchased aluminum tubes clearly intended for use in centrifuges to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. The truth, as we later found out, was that there was no Iraqi nuclear program, and the tubes in question would have been virtually useless for one. They were meant for conventional rockets. But the administration knew the exclusive would be too juicy for Miller to pass up. Her credulous account, passing all the administration's false claims on as a ""scoop,"" appeared on the Times front page on September 8. Vice President Dick Cheney then went on ""Meet the Press"" that very day and said, ""It's now public that in fact he has been seeking to acquire, and we have been able to intercept and prevent him from acquiring, through this particular channel, the kinds of tubes that are necessary to build a centrifuge."" So the administration planted a false story in the Times, then cited the false story on NBC, using the Times' imprimatur to bolster its credibility. That is some Jedi-level media manipulation. Hans Blix: Why invading Iraq was a terrible mistake . Every major news organization, from national newspapers to television networks to magazines, was complicit to some degree in selling the public a brief of false information, from Hussein's allegedly terrifying arsenal of weapons of mass destruction to the fictional links between the Iraqi government and al Qaeda. It wasn't that you couldn't find journalists questioning the official story, raising doubts about the administration's claims, and doing the hard work to determine what the truth was. You always can. Whenever there's a story that the media as a whole get wrong, there's always a reporter somewhere who got it right. The problem was that those voices were so much quieter, pushed so far to the edge of the national debate. Even within some publications there was a tension. One of the journalistic heroes of the pre-war period was Washington Post national security reporter Walter Pincus, who reported the lack of evidence for the administration's hype. But his articles were buried deep within the paper, while the front page blared scary stories about the fearsome threat from Iraq and the Post's editorial page beat the drums for war. Asked later why his stories were shunted to the back pages, Pincus responded, ""The Post was scared."" Opinion: Why the war in Iraq was fought for Big Oil . And so were much of the media. When there's a war in the offing, the flags are waving and dissenters are being called treasonous, the media's courage tends to slip away. Which is particularly regrettable, since the time when the government is pressing for war should be the time when they are more aggressive than ever, exploring every possibility and asking every question, over and over again if need be. That's the time when government is most likely to dissemble and deceive. That was when we most needed the press, and when its failure was the most costly. So the next time people in power propose a new war -- and they will -- journalists need to ask some important questions. What are the limits of our understanding of this country we might invade? What are the motivations of the people pushing for the action? What evidence is the government offering to support its claims? Are there knowledgeable people who disagree, and what are they saying? Which of the government's claims have I investigated myself, and which am I taking on face value? What are the potential consequences of military action, good and bad, and have I explored them in enough detail? And in the context of Iraq, which questions do I wish I had asked last time around? That's just a start, of course. Perhaps lessons have been learned, and the next time a president warns the American people that we have no choice but to invade another country or risk our doom, the press will do a better job of being skeptical, thoughtful and rigorous than it did 10 years ago. It couldn't do much worse. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Waldman.","Paul Waldman: Rumsfeld remarks in push for Iraq War were classic doublespeak .
He says reporters, who are supposed to be quick studies in new areas, were credulous .
He says savvy Bush administration easily duped press into selling case for war .
