A 44-year-old woman thought having facial fillers injected into her cheeks would help her feel and look more youthful. Instead, she was left with lumps under her skin that made it painful for her even to smile. Self-employed Jo said: 'I can feel them all the time in my face, there's one that feels like a cigarette on my face and that hurts all the time. Treatment gone wrong: Jo was left with lumps around her chin and cheeks after having facial fillers . 'It has taken my confidence away from me and what worries me is I'm told it could get worse. I wish I'd never started it.' Ironically Jo had treated herself to the treatment in the hope of raising her spirits after she tragically lost her sister at the age of 29. She explained: 'When my sister died it made me . realise I wanted to live a long time and look good. So I went and had it done to cheer myself up.' 'I could feel the lumps straight away': Mr Vik Vijh at the Last Chance Salon examined Jo to see if there was anything he could do to help . Three years ago Jo had permanent synthetic filler injected into her face but she suffered an adverse reaction to it - leaving her with lumps and bumps under her skin. She contacted the TV show Last Chance Salon to see if they could help. The show's resident cosmetic surgery expert Mr Vik Vijh examined Jo to see if there was anything he could do. 'I could feel the filler right away and see it through the skin,' he said. 'Her skin felt pretty hard and painful.' Finally the result she wanted: After going under the knife, Jo (before, left) had the filler removed and her own fat was used to plump up her cheeks instead (after, right) After going under the knife, Jo had the filler removed and her own fat was used to plump up her cheeks instead . Mr Vijh believed he could help Jo if she would go under the knife so he could lift her skin and remove the lumps of filler. The show followed Jo's surgery and revealed how Mr Vijh removed a 'big c-shaped piece of filler' from her face. 'There's tiny specks of it everywhere,' he said as he operated. After removing these lumps, he then gave Jo a face lift and gave her cheeks the fuller look she was looking for initially by adding her own fat to her face. 'Your own fat is the best filler you can get as your body doesn't react to it,' he explained. After recovering from the surgery, Jo was delighted with her new look. 'I can't stop smiling. I feel brilliant and I can see the difference. I didn't think I'd ever feel like this again,' she said. Her husband Steve, who supported her through out her ordeal agreed. 'Having her back to herself is great. She's a handful but I have missed that handful!' he joked.

Police officers stood guard near the car and Marisol Alicea put her hand up to cover her face as the car sped away.

Police are believed to have questioned Rodriguez earlier this week, but there is no indication she knew of her son's allegedly heinous crimes. She did, however, know the six-year-old girl, Jocelyn, who was born to Berry while she was held captive. Authorities said it is likely the suspect is the father but are carrying out paternity DNA tests. The young girl was the only victim to ever leave the fortified home on Seymour Avenue and is believed to have called Rodriguez 'grandmother'.

Locked up: Castro talks with his public defender, Kathleen DeMetz, during his arraignment on the charges . Released: Brothers Onil (left) and Pedro (right) were not charged in connection with the kidnappings . Today MailOnline revealed that one of the Castro's daughters Arlene Castro said that her father Ariel should be executed for what he did to the women. The revelations of her father's alleged involvement in Gina DeJesus' disappearance were particularly devastating, as Arlene and Gina were classmates and close friends before she vanished. Ms . Castro had been the last person to see DeJesus, then 14, before she was . allegedly snatched by her father in 2004 and imprisoned in his . Cleveland home. She feels that only the death penalty can make him 'suffer the consequences' for allegedly keeping Gina, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight in captivity for a decade. MailOnline can also reveal that Ariel's five children have vowed never to visit him in prison because they are so disgusted by him.

Best of friends: Arlene Castro (right) was the . last person to see Gina DeJesus (left) before she vanished in 2004. Arlene's father Ariel . has been charged in her abduction . They also look away from the TV whenever he comes on because they are outraged that he 'used' them to find his prey. That the call for Ariel to face the death penalty comes from Arlene is a clear sign of the rage she feels towards her father - but also the guilt at being an unwitting part of his twisted scheme. In a separate interview, also with The Plain Dealer, Castro's cousin, Maria Castro-Montes, also apologized to the women. 'We . are horribly sorry for what the three of you went through,' she said, . adding that Castro does not 'define this family and we hope that people . don't judge an . entire family on one persons actions.' 'We . will get through this, our greatest concern is for those three girls,' she said. 'From one family to another, we feel your pain. I feel . horrible that their families for their daughters for so many years. Those families always believe.' With . tears in her eyes, she added that she never suspected Ariel's dark . secret, calling him a loving cousin, father and son, during a television . interview on Thursday. Castro's daughter, Arlene Castro, also became emotional as she asked for the forgiveness of Gina DeJesus, her best friend.

Missing: Michelle Knight, now 32, was also found inside the home, nearly 11 years after she went missing . Their comments came as Castro, 52, was formally charged with four . counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape after the three women and . one of their six-year-old daughters escaped the home. His . brothers, Pedro and Onil, were also arrested on Monday in connection . with the crimes but have now been released after authorities found no . evidence to charge them.

He never bothered nobody. He always put [Ariel] down. He didn't like him.' Castro . refused to look up at judge Lauren Moore or face the bank of TV cameras . inside the courtroom today. He did not speak or acknowledge the judge . when she set bond at $8 million. Prosecutor . Brian Murphy told the court Castro had kidnapped the three women, two . of whom were then young teenagers, for his 'self gratifying and self . serving ways'. He said . their ordeal lasted more than a decade during which time they were . beaten and sexually assaulted by Castro and never allowed to leave the . residence where he held them captive. 'As . inexplicably as they disappeared they reappeared this week,' Murphy . told the hearing. 'Today the situation has turned, your honor.

'Free to resume . their lives with the promise that justice will be served to to protect . the victims and the community he manipulated and deceived.' Castro, a former school bus driver, . showed no reaction during the prosecutor's statement, staring intently . at the floor and trying to hide his face in his jumpsuit. The . arraignment is the first step in the legal process. He will next appear . at the Cuyahoga County Court where evidence will be presented to a . Grand Jury to decide if the case should proceed. It . was revealed in a police press conference yesterday that Ariel Castro . waived his Miranda rights and provided a detailed statement to police. He claimed there are no more victims. It . also emerged that among the 200 items collected from his home was a . letter, in which Castro allegedly confesses to his crimes and writes . about his desire to kill himself 'and give all the money I saved to my . victims'. Horrible details have begun to emerge . about what the girls may have been forced to endure over the last . decade at the hands of their captors. Local police sources revealed that . Ariel Castro would use a sick game to 'train' the three girls not to run . away by pretending to leave the house, only to beat them if they tried . to run free. This is said . to be just one of the manipulative tactics he used to keep the three . young women in his house for up to ten years, in addition to rapes, . frequent beatings and chains hanging from the ceiling.

"By . Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 06:31 EST, 17 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:21 EST, 17 May 2013 . Harriet Harman's  Older Womenâs Commission is seeking to redress the balance of men and women over 50 in prominent roles in TV. Their research has found that just five per cent of the presenters on our screens are women aged 50 plus, as 'older women fall into a black hole in broadcasting' and are 'airbrushed' from our screens when they age. Anna Ford, 69, for one, has complained that is all down to ageism and sexism and that women should . not be 'shown the door' as soon as they have a grey hair or wrinkle when . the same doesn't apply to men. But one female commentator is far from sympathetic. Freelance journalist Carol Sarler said these women who now have 'sour . grapes' about their lack of opportunities on telly only have themselves . to blame. Too late to complain: Carol Sarler, left, said women like Anna Ford, right, should have spoken out about sexism in TV in their youth . Writing today inÂ The Times, . she says they should have thought about their career longevity in their youth - when they instead were happy to trade on their looks in order to get ahead of 'plainer' women. She said: 'The problems didn't start when on-screen women got older; they started when they were 25 and perfectly happy to muscle past their . plainer-Jane colleagues by primping and preening themselves into what . passes for contemporary beauty: big eyes, glossed lips, defined breasts, . dieted hips.' She said that women such as Joan Bakewell and Selina Scott 'tacitly colluded' with the TV tradition that women were not there to 'present the news but to decorate it.' And so they shouldn't be surprised that their greying hair and wrinkled skins means this is no longer a possibility. 'Thinking man's crumpet': Joan Bakewell, left, and Selina Scott shouldn't have traded on their looks when they were younger . 'They sold their souls to the Devil decades ago and now comes playback,' as Carol puts it. She adds that women like Ms Ford should not resent the men like David Dimbleby and John Simpson who are still on TV in their twilight years. She said it's 'irrelevant' that these men now look like 'dinosaurs' because they were never hired for their looks in the first place. Labour deputy leader Miss Harman wants the lack of older women on TV to be readdressed. Women take note: Older men like David Dimbleby remain on TV because they were hired for their knowledge, not their appearance . She said: 'It is not that women arenât there. It . is that they get to a certain age, then they find they are near the exit . and they get pushed out the door.' Miss Harman previously raised the issue of ageism in TV in parliament in 2009 when Arlene Phillips, 66, was sacked from the panel of Strictly Come Dancing in favour of Alesha Dixon, 30. 'I think it's absolutely shocking that Arlene Phillips is not going to be a judge on Strictly Come Dancing. And as equality minister, I am suspicious that there is age discrimination there,' she said at the time. Figures released by Miss Harman's commission this week reveal that the BBC employs just 25 women aged over 50 out of 413 regular presenters. Pushed out: Arlene Phillips, left, was replaced with a younger model on Strictly Come Dancing, while Esther Rantzen said she would 'collapse in shock' if she was offered a mainstream presenting job . This is better than Channel 5 and ITN, who do not employ any older women presenters at all, and Sky News, which has only one. Former Countryfile presenter Miriam . OâReilly, 56, who won a landmark ageism case against the BBC in 2011, . said the latest figures were 'shocking'. Meanwhile, Esther Rantzen, 72, told the Daily Mail that the figures didn't come as a surprise to her as she would 'collapse in shock' if she was offered another . mainstream presenting job. She said older women were only given 'token' roles. But Ms Sarler believes rather than bemoaning the system, change has to come from women themselves. She said today's generation of presenters should consider their long-term careers when they are younger and rely on their knowledge, not their appearance, to get ahead. She explained: 'As the men have proved, start as you mean to go on and you go on longer.'","Just 5% of the presenters on our screens are women aged 50 plus .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 10:59 EST, 10 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:43 EST, 11 September 2012 . Evicted: Human rights issues in France were flagged up following the forced closure of Roma camps in the country . France has come under fire from the United Nations' human rights commisssioner over its treatment of Roma gipsies. While criticising countries such as Syria and Bahrain, Navi Pillay also singled out the French for forcibly deporting illegal immigrants from eastern Europe. They are being forced out of their homes on illegal campsites across France and deported to Romania or Bulgaria. At the opening of the 21st session of the UN's Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, Miss Pillay said she was 'concerned about the recent closures of Roma camps in France, which affected hundreds of people, making them more vulnerable'. The commissioner's assessment is significant because it sets . the tone for the body's 47-nation Human Rights Council, whose . month-long session opened in Geneva on Monday. The U.N. secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, . on a visit to commemorate Switzerland joining the world body a decade . ago, urged the council to focus its attention on five areas, including . discrimination, violence based on sexual orientation and gender . identity, and women's rights. 'It is an affront to our conscience that millions of people still struggle against poverty, hunger and disease,' he said. 'These conditions violate their fundamental human rights.' Vulnerable: Members of the Roma community after being expelled by police from their camp outside Lyon, France. Navi Pillay said the forced closures had left hundreds exposed to human rights concerns . Addressing the council, Mrs Pillay first described her 'grave concern' over the ongoing conflict in Syria, which she said had devastating consequences for the Syrian people. Activists say up to 26,000 people have been killed in the country since the start of the uprising against President Bashar Assad's regime in March last year. Next on her list was Bahrain for handing down 'harsh' prison sentences to human rights activists and opposition figures. Mrs Pillay spoke of human rights problems in Colombia, Ivory Coast and Congo, then mentioned France and Greece. She also noted issues in Kenya, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Mexico, Myanmar and many other countries. War-torn: Navi Pillay said Syria was an area of 'grave concern'. Above, a Syrian woman reacts after an air strike in Azaaz, near Aleppo, in August . Strife: Fighting has been underway in Syria since March 2011. Above, a man carries an injured boy to safety following the air strike on Azaz . She told the packed chamber: 'I am also worried by the recent forced closure of Roma camps in France, which have affected hundreds of people, making them even more vulnerable and exposed to a whole range of human rights concerns. Some of the countries highlighted over human rights concerns: . Syria: Ongoing conflict in the country was at the top of the agenda . Bahrain: Criticised for harsh prison sentences and unfair trial procedures . France: Highlighted over forced closure of Roma camps . Greece: The commissioner raised the issue of violent xenophobic attacks in the country . Kenya: Government urged to 'increase vigilance' after recent violence in the Tana River district . Pakistan: Concerns over the use of blasphemy laws against religious minorities . South Africa: The commissioner raised the violence triggered by strike action at the Lonmin platinum mine, in which 44 people died . 'I acknowledge a number of steps that have been taken by the government but further efforts must be made to address this situation,' she said. In August, police raids in Paris and other French cities dismantled camps housing Roma from Eastern Europe and left hundreds without shelter. The move echoed a crackdown on Roma two years ago under conservative former president Nicolas Sarkozy that drew criticism. But the French government since then has made it easier for Roma, who mostly originate from Romania and Bulgaria, to get jobs and stay in France by expanding the number of sectors where residents of those nations can seek work. The government also abolished a tax paid by employers to hire people from the two countries. Mrs Pillay also noted problems in Greece, where there has been a surge in racist attacks against immigrants with dark skin. 'Equally troubling are violent xenophobic attacks against migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in recent months, for example, in Greece,' she said. 'I am also concerned about reports that the police appeared to have been unable to respond effectively to protect victims of xenophobic crimes.' Greece launched a campaign in August to try to seal its 200-kilometer (130-mile) northeastern border in the face of a crippling financial crisis that has caused joblessness to soar. Diplomats from dozens of countries, including Bahrain, France and Greece, were scheduled to respond to Pillay's criticisms later on Monday. Concerned: Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay made her comments at the opening of the month-long session of the 47-nation Human Rights Council .","Human rights commissioner Navi Pillay flagged up problem areas at the opening of a session of the U.N.

A state welfare worker who allegedly offered extra benefits to a female claimant in exchange for sex has appeared in court. Case worker John Geary, 41, from North Versailles in Pittsburgh, reportedly told a halfway house tenant that he would give her extra money and benefits in exchange for sexual favours. The woman told investigators that Mr Geary offered her $40 for a specific sex act. He also told her there could be more money involved depending on what she would do for him. She described how he took her to a secluded part of the office and said: 'I help girls who help me out,' and, 'there's nothing like getting high and getting a (sex act) at the same time.' Mr Geary allegedly boasted that he had 'helped' other girls in the woman's situation. He said that he could invite women to his home at night because his wife works then and his children sleep on the second floor. The director of the halfway house first notified authorities about Mr Gearyâs behavior because the victim was too afraid. Mike Manko from the District Attorneyâs office told CBS Pittsburgh: 'Sheâs probably scared to say anything about this because for fear sheâll lose benefits and be ostracised by this man in his positions' 'She doesnât know he can do to her benefits-wise, take away money, take away food stamps, things like that.' Abuse of power: Geary used his position at the Allegheny County Assistance Office to illicit sex from a vulnerable benefits claimant . Mr Geary allegedly told the woman that he had done the same thing with women in the past. Mr Geary appeared on counts of patronising prostitutes, bribery in official and political matters, promoting prostitution, official oppression and criminal solicitation on Tuesday.

Bailiffs found the body of a pensioner in his kitchen after he died in November 2010, with Classic FM still playing on his radio two years later. Konstantinos Georgakopolos, originally from Greece, was found on September 26 last year in Chatham, Kent after neighbours thought he might have gone back to Greece. The 75-year-old was only discovered when the bailiffs forced their way in to recover unpaid solicitorsâ fees, an inquest heard. Undiscovered: Konstantinos Georgakopolos was found in his house, pictured, in Kent two years after he died . On a table were his passport and unused plane tickets for November 14, 2010, while post was piled high at his door. Kent Police Sergeant Michelle Burgess . told the hearing: 'No valuables were found at all. He lived quite a poor . life really. There was tea and coffee in the main room, but no food . items.' Mr Georgakopolos was so decomposed that his body was only identified by comparing DNA found on his cigarette lighter to a scrap of his leg bone. The police had visited the home but did not break down the door because they could not smell a body. Recording an open verdict Mid Kent and Medway coroner Patricia Harding said the cause of death would remain a mystery because Mr Georgakopolos was so decomposed. The inquest heard Mr Georgakopolos, who had a stroke in Greece before he returned to the UK, lived a basic existence. Letting agent Maria Bruce, manager at the lettings next door, had a 'nagging feeling' that something was wrong so she spoke to neighbours. They thought he had gone away for a few days but had never come back. Miss Bruce said: 'Weâd known him for years and years, he was more than just a client. He was an eccentric, in a lovely way.' 'Nagging feeling': Neighbours on Mr Georgakopolos's road in Chatham called police to check the house but they did not look inside . 'He once had a little rhyme to tell me how to remember his phone number. If you went over to his house, you knew it wouldnât be a little five-minute visit. You could be there for hours. 'He didnât look 75 - he looked about 50. He was a very good man. He split his time between his home here and in Greece. 'He had his shop in Greece. I think he ran it with his niece, so Iâm not sure why they didnât raise the alarm over there. The whole thing is unbelievable.' Miss Bruce said she helped find the family, making repeated calls to the Greek embassy. She today added: 'We must be the only people who raised the alarm. 'The problem was because he spent half his time in Greece, I thought something must have happened to him there.' 'Itâs so sad that someone was gone for two years. I kept thinking, oh my gosh, thatâs two Christmases.' No family attended the inquest.","Konstantinos Georgakopolos described as 'eccentric, in a lovely way'

A DJ has told how 'evil' chicken thieves stole her precious pet poultry, and is offering a a Â£2,000 reward for their safe return. Mollie Green had rescued most of her 20 hens and two turkeys from battery farms and says that she will 'never get over it'. She lovingly refers to them as her 'girls' and named the turkeys George and Maud. The theft from a paddock at her home near Coventry, West Midlands, is especially cruel as 16 of the hens were ill and disabled. Four raiders were caught on CCTV cutting their way into the wired enclosure with sacks in hand ready to snatch the birds. A few minutes later they had filled the sacks with the birds which they slung into the back of a van and drove away at 10.15pm on Tuesday, April 30. 'If anyone has looked after an injured animal they'll know the bond is incredible,' said the 38-year-old DJ who works for BBC WM and is married to Richard, who also works in radio. 'That's what these animals are to me, I was responsible for each and every one of them. 'We've had George and Maud for over five years, they are part of the family.' 'I'm still devastated. I'll never get over it. It's the not knowing. I know they're somewhere around here but I don't know where they are.' 'The overwhelming sense of responsibility for their lives is what I live with. For someone to snatch them away and end their lives that way is unspeakable. It's evil.' 'Commercial chickens are the most abused animals on earth and they are in my care, there's nobody else.' To the rescue: Mollie Green with a hen that she rescued from a battery farm . 'These animals have no value in the world except to me, I'm responsible for their little souls.' Mrs Green, who volunteers for the British Hen Welfare Trust, gave a home to the recused birds. The theft of domestic fowl has been on the rise in the UK since it has become fashionable to keep poultry as pets and a source of fresh eggs. The cost of the animals has shot up from around Â£5-per-bird to Â£30, according to the Domestic Fowl Trust.There are also fears that the birds could have been stolen for food. Heartbroken: Mollie is offering a reward for the safe return of her 20 hens and two turkeys . Appealing for information about her beloved birds, she said: 'This is time critical, some might still be alive. 'But some won't have survived. Quite a few are on medication or need to be hand fed. They won't be alive without me.' Mollie tearfully recounts the images of the thieves captured on CCTV. 'It was the worst thing I ever had to sit and watch,' she says. Evidence: Pictured is CCTV of a van captured near Mollie's home on Tuesday 30 April between 10.15pm and 10.30 pm . 'But if everyone could look out for this van. It is a long wheel base, semi high top, Ford Transit type van. The colour's not clear, but it's definitely not white.

As many as 6.8million people and 1.8million children have been trapped into long-term poverty, the Centre for Social Justice says in a report. It would mean nearly one in five children are growing up in a workless household â theÂ  second highest in Europe after Macedonia where it is nearly one in four. Entrenched unemployment: The Falinge estate in Greater Manchester, where around 82 per cent of residents claim benefits . The study by the CSJ â founded by .

This is followed by Birmingham (49 . neighbourhoods), Hull (45), Manchester (40), Leeds (37) and Knowsley, . Merseyside (31). CSJ chief Christian Guy, whose . think-tankâs study is called Signed Off, Written Off, said: âThe welfare . ghettos trapping as many as 6.8million people are a national disgrace. âThey represent years of tragic . failure and indifference from the political class.

A confidential report from the Pentagon revealed that plans for over two dozen United States weapons systems were stolen by Chinese hackers.The hackers, who are reportedly employed by the Chinese government to help advance their military system, have been a growing threat for some time now.Amongst the systems stolen were those critical to US missile defenses for Europe, Asia, and the Gulf, and combat aircrafts and ships. Chinese hackers stole plans for confidential United States weapons systems including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter pictured here . The report prepared by the Defense Science Board went on to say that the hacking of US weapons systems by the Chinese poses major risks, according to The Washington Post.These risks include giving China a strategic advantage in future combat against the US. The theft of government weapon plans also allows China to save billions in development funds, while simultaneously advancing their systems in great strides. China denied the cyber-theft charges . made in the report, but President Obama is expected to bring up the . issue when he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping next month.Among the weapons compromised were the advanced Patriot missile system known as PAC-3 and the Navy's Aegis ballistic missile defense systems. Plans for combat aircrafts including the F/A-18 fighter jet, the V-22 Osprey, the Black Hawk helicopter, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter were also stolen along with the Navyâs Littoral Combat Ship, designed to patrol waters close to shore.The report did not state the exact extent of the cyber-thefts or specify whether they came from computer networks belonging to the US government, or their contractors and subcontractors. Government officials say that the weapons system plans stolen by Chinese hackers could comprise future United States military revenuers. A V-22 Osprey pictured here is among the aircrafts for which plans were stolen . United States officials have had growing concerns about Chinese hacking tactics for sometime. A spokesman for the Pentagon told the newspaper in an e-mail, 'The Department of Defense has growing concerns about the global threat to economic and national security from persistent cyber-intrusions aimed at the theft of intellectual property, trade secrets and commercial data, which threatens the competitive edge of U.S. businesses like those in the Defense Industrial Base.'A public version of Defense Science Board's report noted that the recent cyber-thefts could have 'severe consequences for U.S. forces engaged in combat.'Amongst those consequences are severing US forces' communication, data corruption, weapons failures, and possible plane, satellite, and drone crashes.'If they got into the combat systems, it enables them to understand it to be able to jam it or otherwise disable it,â Winslow T. Wheeler, director of the Straus Military Reform Project at the Project on Government Oversight told The Post. 'If theyâve got into the basic algorithms for the missile and how they behave, somebody better get out a clean piece of paper and start to design all over again.' Chinese hackers allegedly associated with the country's government stole United States missile plans for weapons such as Patriot missile batteries (pictured here) Attempts are being made by the Pentagon to combat the escalating cyber-espionage. The government launched a program two years ago which helps defense contractors strengthen their computer firewalls. The program allows independent companies to use classified data from the National Security Agency to scan their networks for malware.However, the Chinese hackers have found ways to adapt and now are shifting their focus towards government subcontractors.The Pentagon is currently expanding their computer defense programs to respond to these new threats. In addition, independent contractors are also beginning to take precautions to prevent hacking. An official from Lockheed Martin, a top defense contractor said the company is 'spending more time helping deal with attacks on the supply chain,' of subcontractors, the Post reported. 'For now, our defenses are strong enough to counter the threat,' the official continued, 'and many attackers know that, so they go after suppliers. But of course they are always trying to develop new ways to attack.'","Chinese hackers reportedly stole plans for confidential United States weapons systems according to a Pentagon report .

And now the author's own annotated copy of the first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is to go under the hammer for charity. The book contains Rowling's handwritten . thoughts and commentary about the book and the film adaptation and includes 22 illustrations of its scenes and characters. JK Rowling's personally annotated first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is due to be sold at the Sotheby's in aid of the writers' association English PEN. On the title page she has added: 'changed my life forever', and drew the Hogwarts crest where it went on to appear in later editions. She also questions: 'Perhaps Hufflepuff house would have the respect it deserves from fans if I'd stayed with my original idea of a bear to represent it?' On another page, Rowling has drawn a picture of a sleeping baby Harry left on the Privet Drive doorstep of the Dursleys, his aunt and uncle, after his parents were killed by Lord Voldemort . The book is one of 51 titles annotated by their authors to be sold at auction in aid of writers' association English PEN at Sotheby's in London on Tuesday. It includes a 43-page 'second thoughts' segment from Rowling, with notes such as, 'I wrote the book ... in snatched hours, in clattering cafes or in the dead of night. 'For me, the story of how I wrote 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' is written invisibly on every page, legible only to me ...' Other contributions include copies of Roald Dahl's Matilda, Phillip Pullman's Northern Lights and Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary. Dr Philip W. Errington, director of printed books and manuscripts at Sotheby's, said: 'This can undoubtedly be regarded as the definitive copy of any Harry Potter book. 'Not only is it a fine copy of a first edition of the first book, but the author has significantly personalised it with numerous written comments and many impressive and evocative illustrations. 'The personality of the author leaps from these pages and we are treated to a remarkable insight into her creative genius.' In one of the annotations, Rowling adds the words 'changed my life forever' to the book's title. Only 500 copies of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone were printed in its first run. Now author JKRowling has provided the annotated first edition for a charity auction at Sotheby's this week . On the chapter entitled Quidditch, Rowling's notes explain the sport's origins: 'was invented in a small hotel in Manchester after a row with my then boyfriend. I had been pondering the things that hold a society together, cause it to congregate and signify its particular character and knew I needed a sport. It infuriates men, in my experience (why is the Snitch so valuable etc.), which is quite satisfying given my state of mind when I invented it' She also questions whether a badger to . represent Hufflepuff, one of the four houses at Hogwarts School of . Witchcraft and Wizardry where Harry studied, was the right choice. Rowling writes: 'Perhaps Hufflepuff would have the respect it deserves from fans if I'd stayed with my original idea - a bear to represent it?' Among the edition's 22 hand-drawn illustrations is one of the orphaned baby Harry wrapped in blankets and left on his auntie and uncle's doorstep with a note from Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore explaining that Lord Voldemort had killed the child's parents, James and Lily.

"By . Ray Massey . UPDATED: . 19:31 EST, 20 December 2011 . Rail passengers face inflation-busting fare rises of up to 11 per cent in the New Year, it emerged yesterday. Commuter groups were furious that while the average rise from January 2 will be 5.9 per cent, some passengers could see fares go up by far more. Train companies revealed the fares a day after the Office of Rail Regulation took enforcement action against Network Rail for poor and worsening punctuality, with one in eight trains (13 per cent) running late. Costs: Commuters at Victoria Station, London. The price of train travel is set to rise by an average 5.9 per cent - higher than the Retail Price Index rate of inflation . Imminent fare rises didn't deter the Queen who alights at King's Lynn yesterday after taking the 10.45am First Capital Connect train from King's Cross to Sandringham for Christmas . The blow to passengers also comes . amid complaints of overcrowding and just before the Christmas getaway in . which passengers face replacement bus services to cover engineering . works. Sophie Allain, of . the Campaign for Better Transport, said: âAnother New Year approaches . and yet another round of eye-watering train fare hikes looms. We still . have the highest fares in Europe.â Manuel . Cortes, leader of the TSSA transport union, said: âOnce again we have . the private train operators defying all economic logic and increasing . the squeeze on passengers during a recession.â The . union accused train companies of trying to âbury bad newsâ by hiding . big fare rises among the millions that had been announced. It said a . return saver with Virgin from Euston to Nuneaton would rise 9.2 per cent . from Â£35.80 to Â£39.10. Labourâs transport spokesman Maria Eagle said many tickets would see a similar percentage rise. The . 5.9 per cent average rise covers all rail fares â both regulated and . unregulated. Regulated fares, which include season tickets and make up . around 40 per cent of the total, will rise by an average of 6 per cent. Condemnation: Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT, left, said rail . operators were 'laughing all the way to the bank', while Maria Eagle, . the shadow transport secretary, right, accused the Government - which has a policy of raising train fares - of being out of . touch with the difficulties faced by hard pressed commuters . Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said the money raised will be reinvested in the rail network . But . train companies are allowed to add another 5 per cent â making 11 per . cent in total â provided other fares are reduced to keep the average at 6 . per cent. On unregulated fares, which make up around 60 per cent of the . total, there is no limit on rises that can be made. Even . around the average 6 per cent increase, a commuter from Swindon to . London will still see the cost of an annual season ticket rise by Â£424 . to Â£7,448. Those heading for London from Northampton will see annual . season tickets go up 6.92 per cent to Â£4,756. Next monthâs rise also . takes the price of an annual season ticket to London above Â£4,000 for . the first time at a number of towns, including Hastings, Eastbourne and . Bedford. But the Hastings rise (4.95 per cent) and the Eastbourne . increase (4.97 per cent) are, at least, below the national average. The . boss of the group representing train companies denied being less than . open about the detail of the increases. Michael Roberts, chief executive . of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said: âMoney raised . through fares helps pay for new trains, faster services and better . stations. âClearly we . understand these are really difficult times financially for a lot of . people. But actually people are voting with their feet and their wallets . increasingly to travel by train. Last year we carried an extra hundred . million passengers.â The . basic 6 per cent rise in regulated fares is set by the Government and is . based on the July 2011 RPI inflation figure plus 1 per cent. Rail union TSSA accused Atoc, which announced the rises today, of trying to 'bury bad news' by giving 'only the barest details' of the overall increase. In the past Atoc has given details of fare rises for each train company rather than just giving an overall average figure for all tickets. Today, Atoc in its press release merely referred those wanting to learn about individual fare rises to the National Rail Enquiries website. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA transport union, said: 'Once again we have the private train operators defying all economic logic and increasing the squeeze n passengers during a recession. 'All other big companies, like Tesco and Sainsbury's, actually cut prices during the downturn. Even the BBC is freezing its licence fee. 'But they carry on with their inflation-plus rises, which will get even worse in 2013 and 2014 when passengers face RPI plus 3 per cent increases.' Passengers are suffering from a lack of healthy rivalry between bus companies, competition chiefs concluded today. The Competition Commission said there were about 1,245 bus companies in England, Scotland and Wales, carrying 2.9 billion passengers a year. But the five largest operators (Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead, National Express and Stagecoach) carried 70 per cent of those passengers. The commission also found that head-to-head competition between operators was uncommon and that, on average, the largest operator in an urban area ran 69 per cent of local bus services. Jeremy Peat, chairman of the CC's local bus market investigation group, said competition had 'stagnated' and operators face little challenge for customers. He went on: 'On the occasions when there are outbreaks of rivalry, they don't tend to last and passengers are quickly returned to ... the status quo.' This graph plots rail industry revenues and subsidies from 1989/90 to 2009/10 . Ministers . had originally planned to increase this annual fare cap from RPI plus 1 . per cent to RPI plus 3 per cent. But this decision was reversed by . Chancellor George Osborne in last monthâs autumn statement. However, the Government still intends that the higher RPI plus 3 per cent formula will apply in January 2013 and January 2014. Inflation-busting . rail fare rises were begun under Labour to switch the burden of paying . for the railways away from the taxpayer towards the passenger.","Average fare increase beats RPI inflation at 5.9% .

The 14-year-old was described as the 'World's Biggest One Direction Fan' on her funeral's order of service,  which also featured a photo of the boy band. Jade died at a friend's house in Atherton, Greater Manchester, last month, and loved-ones gathered today to remember her as she was laid to rest in a pink coffin. It is thought she may have been attacked because she was carrying a meat pie. The four dogs - believed to be two bull mastiffs and two Staffordshire bull terriers - had to destroyed by police. Service:Â  Mourners said goodbye to Jade Lomas-Anderson (pictured with mother Shirley) at her funeral today, where she was described as the 'world's biggest One Direction fan' Tragic: The heartbroken step-father of Jade Anderson, Michael Anderson (front right) carries her coffin out of St Clements Church today .

Fitting: The pink coffin of Jade Anderson in a horse drawn carriage that took her from the church today . Her devastated family had feared they may not be able to afford a funeral but people from their community and pupil's from Jade's school raised several thousand pounds through sponsored events and selling commemorative green ribbons. Hundreds of schoolmates, many shedding tears, joined her heartbroken mother Shirley Lomas-Anderson, who led mourners into church for the service. Today's funeral at St Clement Church, in Chorlton, Manchester, was a 'celebration of Jade's life', according to rector Ken Flood, who led service. Jade's stepdad Mike Lomas-Anderson, 33, led tributes, telling mourners 'he had 'never imagined he would be standing here talking about one of his beautiful daughters is such circumstances'. 'But I can tell everyone she is shining in the sky - that place where she will always be,' he added. 'Beautiful Jade will always be in our hearts.' Saddened: Pupils from Fred Longworth High School arrive for the funeral of their classmate, who died after a dog attack . Tributes: A mourner arrives for the funeral of Jade Anderson, wearing a t-shirt with a picture of One Direction, while others sob at the church . Tributes: People at the funeral wore justice for Jade T-Shirts, as there is unlikely to be any prosecutions over her death . Jade was carried into the church in a pink coffin and many mourners wore 'Justice For Jade' t-shirts. Jade's older brother Cane read out a touching poem, saying: 'Every day I miss the smile I can't replace.' Her mother, Shirley Lomas-Anderson, had earlier posted a message on her Facebook page, which read: 'U are so perfect our beautiful princess your our hole world love and miss u millions xxxxxx.' A private burial followed the service. Boarded up: A police officer stands guard next to the home where Jade had been attacked and died . Destroyed: A male Staffordshire Bull Terrier (left) and Bull Mastiff Neo (right) were killed after the attack . Put down: Buddy, a Bull Mastiff, was also one of the dogs destroyed by armed police . Greater Manchester Police, who are investigating Jade's death, said earlier this month it was 'unlikely' anyone would be prosecuted over Jade's death. They are unable to take action because the dogs involved were not banned breeds and under current laws dog owners cannot be prosecuted if attacks take place on private property. But Jade's family have launched an e-petition calling for a change to the law and her death has prompted MPs to call for urgent reform of dog control laws. In February, the government announced it would amend legislation so dog owners could be prosecuted if their animal attacks someone on private property. But campaigners say the proposals do not go far enough and more preventative action is needed against dangerous dogs.","Jade Lomas-Anderson died last month in an incident that shocked Britain .

Senior civil servants in the Department of Health will have to work on the frontline of the NHS if they want to be promoted, the Health Secretary is to announce. From next month, 200 senior officials will have to perform tasks such as mopping floors, emptying bedpans and serving meals to care home residents as the Government responds to the Francis Report into patient neglect at the Mid Staffordshire Trust. The plans, to be unveiled on Monday by Jeremy Hunt, will require top Whitehall officials to perform roles such as GP receptionist and hospital porter for a total of four weeks a year for six years. It will be rolled out to all 2,000 of the department's civil servants later this year. Those who do not clock up their frontline hours will miss out on opportunities to climb the Whitehall ladder. 'This will not be a clip-board . exercise,' a Whitehall source told the Times. 'Officials will not do jobs they . are untrained for like nursing but they will be getting a clearer idea . of what it is like to be a patient.' The Francis Report, published in March, described how patients at Mid Staffordshire had been left âunwashed, unfed and without fluidsâ and âdeprived of their dignityâ. But it concluded that such failings were not a ârare eventâ and almost certainly existed at other hospitals across the country. The report made 290 recommendations to how the NHS and Department of Health should improve patient care. It urged health officials to make more effort to get out of Whitehall and meet patients. Civil servants will have to complete four weeks of work as hospital porters, cleaners, and GP receptionists a year . Last week Mr Hunt manned the phones at GP surgeries in Kennington and Wandsworth, south London. He has also spent time as a hospital porter and cleaner in two of the capital's accident and emergency departments. 'To understand more about what . patients and service users need and the issues which are important to . them, civil servants need to walk a mile in their shoes,' he told the Times.

A male model who took his Thai girlfriend to a champagne-fuelled swingers party beat her up after he found her with another man, a jury heard yesterday. Patrick Ribbsaeter punched Wachiraporn Sara-Pod so many times on their drive home that she could barely see out of her swollen face, the Old Bailey was told. She eventually fled his alleged assault wearing nothing but a fur coat. 'Suffocated': Patrick Ribbsaeter, left, is . accused of hitting Wachiraporn Sara-Pod, right, repeatedly in the face, . smashing her head against the dashboard and throttling her . The couple had earlier gone to the âKilling Kittensâ sex party at a restaurant in Leicester Square, London. Tickets for the event in October cost Â£150 a person, and complimentary champagne flowed freely. Within a few hours of the party beginning, the court was told, couples were openly having sex. But instead of being happy to share his lover with others, Ribbsaeter allegedly flew into a jealous rage when he caught her in the toilet with a fellow party-goer. Miss Sara-Pod, 29, insisted she was only taking drugs with a male friend when her 32-year-old boyfriend burst in. âI was feeling tipsy. I remember I took two lines of cocaine,â she said. âPatrick came in and said I had slept with a guy in the toilet. He was really angry. He grabbed me and took me out.â Ribbsaeter then left her and went to another West End nightspot, the British Luxury Club. She followed him there, but he refused to talk to her, she said, and he left with his friend Dheeraj Harjani, a company director. Finally at 6.30am he agreed to meet her by her Land Rover Discovery in a car park. When she arrived he struck her across the face, knocking her to the ground, the jury was told â and struck her again while she was sitting on the floor. A passer-by saw the alleged attack and asked: âWhy are you hitting the girl?â before punching Ribbsaeter in the face, the court heard, in turn knocking him to the ground. Patrick Ribbsaeter, 32, is accused of beating his girlfriend repeatedly, forcing her to flee her car wearing just a fur coat . But the Miss Sara-Pod then intervened to protect Ribbsaeter, saying: âPlease donât hurt him, heâs my boyfriend,â jurors were told. Ribbsaeter then drove her towards his home in Streatham, south London, while constantly asking if she had sex with the man in the toilet, it was claimed. Miss Sara-Pod said: âPatrick hit me again and again. He was asking me âDid you have sex with that guy?â I say no and when I say no he hit me. âHe tell me Iâm lying. He said he will hit me until I say the truth. âThen he grabbed my hair and hit my head on the console. He kept hitting me so many times that I tried to open the car to jump out.â Ribbsaeter eventually stopped the car on their way home, and asked her if she wanted to have sex on the back seat, she claimed. âI said yes because I believed it would calm him down,â said Miss Sara-Pod. But after the sex he punched her in the face and put his hands around her throat, she claimed. âHe had his whole body on top of me and kept punching on my face many times,â she went on. âI was bleeding. âHe had his hand round my neck and squeezed it until I felt suffocated.â The court heard that the assault only stopped when Ribbsaeter noticed she was losing consciousness. Prosecutor Camilla De Silva told the jury: âIt ended when she managed to escape from the car wearing nothing but a fur coat. âShe ran to a garage and a mechanic called 999 at 10.14am.â Ribbsaeterâs friend Mr Harjani told the court he had joined him on his search for Miss Sara-Pod at the sex party â and looked on as the accused man pushed open a lavatory cubicle. Mr Harjani said: âShe was there kind of slumped on the toilet seat and the floor â and there was another guy there having sex with her or something. He was half naked.â Mr Harjani said Ribbsaeter later told him the man had tried to rape her, and added: âPatrick said to me it was OK for her to have sex with another guy if she had her senses, because thatâs the fun of the party, however,Â  not if she was being taken advantage of.â Ribbsaeter denies causing grievous bodily harm. The case continues. The controversial and outspoken founder of Killing Kittens is one of the leading figures on London's swinging scene. She even describes herself as 'one of the world's leading sextrepreneurs'. Which makes her connection to the Royal Family all the more intriguing. When she's not hosting sex parties and expanding her adult empire, Emma Sayle is also the head of The Sisterhood, an all-female charity group which Kate Middleton joined in 2007.

Wanted: Police have issued a Canada-wide warrant for Rocco Luka Magnotta in connection with severed limbs sent to Canadian offices . A low-budget porn actor suspected of sending dismembered body party to offices across Canada allegedly filmed himself hacking his victim's body up with an ice-pick and then posted the sickening video online. Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, is the subject of a massive manhunt after a man's maggot-ridden torso was found in a locked suitcase by his Montreal apartment block. The sickening 'snuff video' footage, called '1 Lunatic 1 Ice Pick' and uploaded last week, shows a naked male tied to a bed frame being attacked with both an ice pick and a kitchen knife. The Best Gore website says the film, which is unclear where or when it was filmed, then shows the victim being stabbed and having his throat slashed to the soundtrack of True Faith by New Order. He is later decapitated, dismembered and sexually assaulted. It is believed he was already dead when the camera started rolling. The man in the video, whose face is never revealed, then goes on to play with the corpse's body parts in a 'sexual manner'. Doubt was initially cast on the veracity of the film but police have now confirmed 'it depicts the actual crime', the National Post reports. Police believe a festering foot from the body was then mailed to Canadian Conservative Party's HQ, and a hand was found at a postal warehouse, both in Ottawa, Ontario. Officers believe he could also be behind a sickening video posted online where kittens are tortured and killed. The animal-cruelty video, filmed two years ago, shows a man looking like Magnotta placing two kittens inside an airtight bag and using a vacuum cleaner to suck out the air. In distressing scenes, too graphic to be posted on MailOnline, the cleaner is then switched on and the air is slowly sucked out of the bag. The mewing kittens can be seen wriggling around and clawing to escape as the polythene tightens around them. Search: Local news reports have identified Magnotta, 29, as a low-budget adult film star . Wanted: Luka Magnotta is believed to be behind a gruesome video showing the murder of a man . After switching off the cleaner, the sick teen opens the bag and proudly holds up the body of one of the kittens for his camera, before displaying them on his bed. Yesterday, police in masks combed through the blood-soaked Montreal studio apartment where the torso was discovered. A blood stained mattress remained there after they left. Police Commander Ian Lafreniere said: 'For most of the officers that were there all night long this is the kind of crime scene they've never seen in their career.' He said they are investigating the possibility that other body parts might have been mailed, and believed the suspect and the victim knew each other. The packages with the foot and the hand, he added, had been mailed to Ottawa from Montreal. But it was not clear why. Lafreniere added: 'As a father, I would have trouble sleeping at night knowing that the suspect was in my neighborhood.' Investigation: An internal shot of Magnotta's apartment, outside of which a maggot-ridden torso was found in a suitcase . Vacant: The tenant of the apartment, Luke Magnotta, has not been seen since the body parts were sent . Crime scene: Luka Magnotta's apartment in Ottawa, Canada . Manhunt: Magnotta is also known by the names Eric Clinton Newman and Vladimir Romanov . Police said Magnotta is also known by the names Eric Clinton Newman and Vladimir Romanov. They described him as white, 5ft 8in tall, with blue eyes and black hair. His internet presence indicates he is a bisexual porn actor and model. Police discovered the severed foot after Jenni Bryne, a top political adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, opened a bloodstained box at Conservative party headquarters on Tuesday. When Bryne opened the box, a foul odor overcame the office. 'It was such a horrible odour. I'm sure many of us will not forget it,' Conservative Party spokesman Fred DeLorey said. Police said the package was addressed to the Conservative Party of Canada and not to a specific person. Canada Post would not comment on the discoveries. Hazardous material: A police officer carries a yellow bag with the bloody package that contains the festering foot mailed to Conservative Party headquarters on Tuesday . Scene: Sick idea: The Tories have said they believe that, even though the package was addressed to Conservative Party headquarters, the foot was not a political message . Eric Schorer, the manager of the building where the suspect lived, said Magnotta had been living there for about four months but had not been seen around in a while. He said there were never any complaints about noise in the unit, and that Magnotta passed a credit test to rent there. 'He seemed like a nice guy,' Schorer said. Richard Payette, who lived across the hall from Magnotta, said the door of Apartment 208 was left open for part of the day yesterday, with an overwhelming smell drifting out into the hallway, like bad meat. For nearly two years, Magnotta's name has been notorious among animal-rights activists looking for a man who tortured and killed cats and posted videos of it online. Friendly: This video, posted online two years ago, shows a man who looks like Magnotta appearing to be caring for the cats (he disguised his face) Sickening: But the man then seals the bag, attaches the vacuum cleaner hose and sucks the air out of it . In 2009, he posted an article online entitled How to Completely Disappear and Never Be Found; it shares a six-step process for escaping and changing an identity. It is not the first time he has been in the news. Magnotta previously complained his life had been ruined by rumours he was dating Karla Homolka, who raped and killed teenage girls. Reports add he may have spread the rumours himself, The Canadian Press reported. Magnotta has no criminal record.","Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, subject of massive Canada-wide manhunt .

Inappropriate: The images of women holding phones and peering into the camera suggestively while urging viewers to call them via premium rate telephone numbers has sparked outrage among mothers . Parents have called for broadcasters to stop showing pornography on Freeview channels available in millions of homes. They are furious that TV companies are allowed to broadcast X-rated material that can easily be seen by children. Channels such as Dutch-based Babestation and Smile TV show naked women massaging each other and simulating sex to entice viewers to call premium-rate numbers for more hardcore content. Some 77 per cent of British households have Freeview â leaving most of the nationâs children in danger of accidentally accessing the graphic images. Although the UK has strict child-protection laws, European legislation stipulates that TV companies are moderated by the regulators from their home country, and not the ones they air in. This means the channels in question are regulated by the Netherlandsâ permissive watchdog, the Commissariaat voor de Media. As a result, they are free to broadcast graphic, sexually suggestive content on free-to-air digital channels between 10pm and 6am. Powerless: Ofcom is powerless to ban the channels because they are registered in the Netherlands . Yesterday it emerged that media . regulator Ofcom has made a formal complaint to its Dutch counterpart, . following floods of complaints online.

Broadcaster Six TV has complained to MPs and regulators that the porn . appears before its regional content in the programme list and viewers . can stumble on them as they scroll through the channels. It is possible to delete the offending content, but only temporarily. Freeview automatically updates its service periodically to scan for new . channels â a process that also reinstates any that have been blocked. Last night Caroline Dinenage, Conservative MP for Gosport and a member . of the parliamentary inquiry into online child protection, said: âThe . shocking images we are talking about here are being shown on terrestrial . television and are available free to everyone, including children and . teenagers. âWe need to urgently address TV content that could be harming our . children.

Anarchists vowed to âre-enactâ the poll tax riots last night as they plotted to wreck Baroness Thatcherâs funeral. Die-hard fanatics hope a âprotestâ in Trafalgar Square on Saturday night will ignite an explosion of violence that will culminate with disturbances at her funeral on Wednesday. They plan to hang an effigy of the former prime minister in a macabre âcelebrationâ that has been planned for more than a decade. Running amok: Black Bloc thugs break away from a TUC protest in London last October . Among those leading the charge are members of the shadowy Black Bloc group, which fought pitched battles with police during student and anti-cuts riots. The âcollectiveâ of young thugs takes its name from their anonymous uniform of black clothes and hoods. Their campaign of violence is fuelled by rallying threats posted on networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Police intelligence analysts are monitoring a growing torrent of disturbing online messages. Dozens of groups are urging others to âtake to the streetsâ, including one under the title: âIf Thatcher does get a State Funeral We Will Riot.â Black Bloc protesters break away from the main march and march along Regent Street . The focus of the surge of anger is on Trafalgar Square this Saturday where hundreds are expected to gather for an anti-Thatcher protest. The roots of the event go back more than a decade when followers of Left-wing websites vowed to hold a âpartyâ the Saturday after Lady Thatcher died. Anti-capitalist protester Professor Chris Knight warned there will be a âhistorical re-enactmentâ of the 1990 Poll Tax riots. The 70-year-old, who was sacked from his university lecturer role after inciting violence against bankers, branded Lady Thatcher a âblood-sucking vampireâ. He said: âPartly weâll be remembering and . celebrating the poll tax riots, because that was when we drove the . stake into the blood-sucking vampire. Baroness Thatcher's funeral could be hijacked by die-hard fanatics who plan to protest . âI was at the Poll Tax riots in 1990. Iâve heard that there may be a riot re-enactment in full costume by one of those historical re-enactment societies.â Anarchists and members of the hard Left hope the anti-Thatcher protests will reignite the student protests that fizzled out in spring 2011. Many anarchists wereÂ  disappointed that the lawlessness did not spark mainstream dissent and further anti-cuts protests. Anonymous organisers are privately boasting that up to 3,000 people could travel to London on Saturday. Among them are expected to be Black Bloc activists as well as members of Class War and the All London Anarchist Revolutionary Mob. They will be joined by the Green and Black Cross, an anarchist support group, which offers legal advice, field kitchens and street medics. One former anarchist told the Daily Mail that a leading member of the Black Bloc was a ringleader in the attack on the Tory HQ at Millbank in 2010. He said: âHe will going and he will be prepared for trouble. Itâs a perfect storm because the weather is warming up and thatâs when it kicks off. Already protesters, seen here in Brixton, have been ghoulishly celebrating the former prime minister's death . Police and party goers clash after a Margaret Thatcher death street party got out of hand in Bristol . âThatcherâs death will bring out the hard core. There is time for anarchists to travel in from Bristol, Scotland, up north. âTrafalgar Square had been planned for ten years and about four years ago the plans were done in more detail, because everyone knew she was going to die soon.â Veteran anarchist Ian Bone, who founded Class War, said his followers will hang an effigy of Thatcher on the empty fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square. He said they would then play football with her head up Charing Cross Road, which leads to the nearest police station. He added: âThere is talk of a statue to Thatcher in Trafalgar Square. Why wait? Every revolution needs the toppling of an iconic statue from Stalin to Saddam. So on Saturday Class War will hang a statue of Thatcher from the fourth plinth so she can be toppled in a moment of liberation and retribution.â Gangs of hooligans operating as part of Black Bloc have infiltrated anti-capitalist and anti-globalisation protests worldwide. They have copied the tactics of violent 1970s German anti-nuclear demonstrations to intimidate police and escape identification and capture. Their trademark outfit includes a black hooded top and many carry fireworks, paint bombs and tools in small rucksacks. A Met spokesman said the force was aware several groups wanted to âprotestâ. He said: âThe Met wishes to speak to anyone who may choose to demonstrate so their rights to protest can be upheld while respecting the rights of Baroness Thatcherâs family and those who wish to pay their respects.â","Plans to hang an effigy of the former prime minister in Trafalgar Square .

A lesbian couple have won custody of a child following a court battle with the youngster's surrogate mother and sperm donor over who could be its legal parents. The gay women were awarded sole custody rights of the youngster after a three-year legal wrangle ended in the High Court, it emerged today. However, the judge's decision has left the wife of the donor traumatised and upset at the 'selfish' determination of the lesbian couple to have a baby. Sperm donation: A legal wrangle over the child went on for three years . She told the Sunday Times: 'Unfortunately, one thing I have learnt about couples who want to have children at any cost is that they are ultimately selfish.The only thing they think about is their need for a child.' Sperm frozen in liquid nitrogen is preserved at a laboratory . The wrangle involving the wife, given the alias 'Ann 'by the paper, and her businessman husband 'Michael' began after he contacted a sperm donation website. Donors normally remain anonymous until the child becomes an adult at 18, but Michael wanted the lesbian couple to know him and arranged to donate privately. The two women were infertile and used a friend as a surrogate who donated her own eggs making her and Michael the child's genetic parents. The lesbian couple then tried to legally adopt the child which is usual in cases involving a sperm donor and surrogate, but were turned down by their local authority. To get round this, the Sunday Times claims the surrogate mother temporarily changed her surname by deed poll to that of one of the lesbians and this was put on the child's birth certificate. The child was raised by the couple as their own until the night when Ann broke down and wept at a dinner party for friends and told their story to the guests. One of them was a lawyer who reportedly said that since the two women were not the child's legal parents, it could be taken into care by social services at any time. But Michael lost when he took the case to the High Court and now he and his wife have changed their will so that an inheritance can only be divided between the children they have together. Ann had backed her husband's involvement in donating sperm, but now believes wives should be consulted and counselled before giving them the go-ahead. She told the paper: 'No one ever thinks of the wives of the men who donate and the pain they go through.'","Child was at the centre of a wrangle over who could be its legal parents .

MEPs are preparing to vote on a blanket ban on pornography - which includes censorship of the internet - throughout the EU's 27 member states. But research scientist and writer Dr Brooke Magnanti â who found fame under her pen name Belle Du Jour â says outlawing erotic entertainment sites and publications will not, as is intended, promote gender equality, and could do more harm than good. The EU's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality proposed the ban, which is being voted on tomorrow. But, writing in her Telegraph blog, Dr Magnanti says such measures are not only futile, they are also fundamentally 'wrong'. Dr Brooke Magnanti, left, with actress Billie Piper, right, who played the character of Belle De Jour in the ITV dramatisation . Arguing that the proposal is based upon the misinformed assumption that all pornography is violent and misogynistic, Dr Magnanti says: 'Porn is not the cause of gender stereotypes; eliminating it will not end them. 'Banning access to porn in Egypt obviously won't do anything to make women more equal to men there. Banning adult entertainment does not eliminate sexual crime, as Iceland surely should know, with its epidemic of sex crimes despite bans on strip clubs and prostitution. 'So why does anyone think such measures would have an effect in the EU?â Dr Magnanti funded her doctoral studies between 2003 and 2004 working as a London call girl, then published her diaries in the anonymous blog Belle de Jour: Diary of a London Call Girl. Her blog was dramatised by ITV under the title Secret Diary Of A Call Girl in 2007, with actress Billie Piper playing the title role. Dr Magnanti revealed her true identity in 2009. MEPs will vote tomorrow on whether there should be a blanket ban on pornography across the 27 member states . One of the Belle De Jour books, dramatised from Dr Brooke Magnanti's blog, left, and Bille Piper in the ITV series, right . In her Telegraph blog Dr Magnanti opines that although the MEP vote will not be a legislative measure, it will pave the way for legislation to come. She complains that one of the main problems is that the definition of pornography is fuzzy, different to everyone, and as such could potentially, to some people, include topless pro-feminist demonstrations by groups such as the Ukraine's Feme, or raunchy self-portraits texted between partners. Banning all such electronic communications would be, she says, completely impossible. Will MEPs vote to ban pornography within the EU? She continues: âBut, enough about the logistics of it - this is wrong. As per ever, the focus of the panic is mainstream, heterosexual porn being viewed only by men. âYet again the assumption is that all men are easily programmed, woman-hating abusers, and all women are meek sub-adults who must be protected from the clutches of sexy, sexy evil. 'In this worldview, gay people, mutual consent, and women's sexual agency conveniently do not exist. 'If you think this represents all or even most of pornography then you need to get out more.

Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, has predicted China will be the world's most 'sophisticated hacker' in his new book predicting the future of technology. His new book 'The Digital Age' co-written by Jared Cohen, who runs Google Ideas, the search giantâs think tank, believe that China, is 'the most sophisticated and prolific hacker of foreign companies'. They also say that the country is the 'the world's most active and enthusiastic filterer of information', highlighting how China strongly censors information from outside, carefully selecting what its population can access. The Wall Street Journal, who reviewed the book, say that the book concentrates on how China's government and state companies are willing to use cyber crime - giving the increasingly powerful state 'an economic and political edge'. The Google pair examine how China's readiness to commit cyber crime is a 'difference in values' from other countries such as America - meaning the country will spy on big businesses compared to other states that crack down on such activity. The duo predict that China will only continue to grow in terms of influence, as their technological firms become more competitive and more advanced. According to the Wall Street Journal, the book predicts how other countries might follow China's lead in terms of hacking, so as to compete in terms of political and economical gain. Chinese authorities and Google have had a fraught relationship since January 2010, when the company said it may shut down Chinese operations due to a 'sophisticated and targeted' cyber attack. Google said at the time that it was no longer willing to censor its Chinese search engine. Rocky: Google and China have had a fraught relationship over the nature of censorship . The company began to redirect search queries from mainland China to its Hong Kong website.

The Bangladeshi factory where 112 workers were killed in a horrific fire was being used by major Western brands including Disney and Sears, it has been reported. Documents and clothing in the charred remains of the factory link it with a range of brands who are alleged to have placed orders there. Account books in the factory revealed that its management had taken orders from both Disney and Sears, as reported by AP. Devastation: The charred remains of the Tazreen Fashions Ltd factory, above, located outside Dhaka. The factory has been linked with a number of major Western brands . Possible link: Account books found at the burnt Tazreen Fashions Ltd factory in Bangladesh suggest they had taken orders from Disney . Supermarket giant Wal-Mart and rap star Sean 'Diddy' Combs have also been linked to the Tazreen Fashions Ltd factory, prompting campaigners to call for better safety standards in Bangladesh's garment industry. Blue and off-white shorts from Combs' ENYCE label were found stacked in containers and piled on the floor, while similar piles of clothing from Wal-Mart's Faded Glory brand were discovered among the remains. Anger: Protestors gathered for a third day of demonstrations over dangerous factory conditions . Photographs have also emerged showing how some of the West's biggest firms had their garments made at the factory, located just outside Dhaka, with campaigners holding up the clothing. Workers who survived the atrocity accused their bosses of locking the doors after fire alarms began to ring. They said bosses demanded that staff should not leave the factory and alleged that fire extinguishers did not work within the factory. Fire service officials said workers, who . were mostly women, were unable to escape because there were not enough . emergency exits. Some leapt to their deaths from windows. Bangladesh is renowned for its textile industry that supplies major Western brands, however safety records at many factories are questionable. Wal-Mart denied any knowledge of current dealings with the Tazreen factory. The American store received an audit deeming the factory 'high-risk' last year and said that it had decided to stop doing business with the factory. It said that a supplier had subcontracted to the factory nonetheless. Wal-Mart said that it has now stopped working with the subcontractor. Local police said that three factory officials have been arrested at their homes in Savar, nearby the factory. Police did not identify the factory officials or give their job status. They have not ruled out sabotage. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Interior Minister Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir have said arson is suspected. Evidence: The director of the Bangladesh Center for Workers Solidarity, Kalpona Akter, poses with a garment with the logo 'Faded Glory' owned by Wal-Mart . Saturday's fire has put a spotlight on global retailers that source clothes from Bangladesh, where the cost of labour is low - as little as $37 a month for some workers - and rights groups have called on firms to sign up to a fire safety program. Bangladesh has around 4,500 garment . factories that make clothes for brands including Tesco, Walmart, JC . Penney, H&M, Marks & Spencer, Kohl's and Carrefour. Few of the . factories take proper safety precautions. Around 3,000 garment workers carried out protests for the third day running last night, blocking roads and hurling stones at factories, according to local television reports. Shopping giant: Sears is alleged to have had contracts with the factory in Bangladesh where at least 112 people were killed . Officers dispersed the rioters using batons after the demonstrators forced most local factories to close their doors in order to avoid violence. Dickies, a popular brand which sells work clothes and is based in Fort Worth, Texas, said it had concluded its production schedule with the factory earlier this year. C&A, a European discount clothing retailer, confirmed the destroyed factory was producing an order of 220,000 sweaters for its operations in Brazil. One of its brands is called ACE. It said in a statement it feels a deep sense of solidarity with the families who lost relatives in the fire. US retailer Sears Holdings Corp said its clothing was not meant to be made in that textile factory, and was investigating reports that one of its brands had been found in the charred debris. Other brands, such as Esprit Holdings Ltd , continued to deny any connection and distanced themselves from the disaster. Two further incidents outside Dhaka - a fire at a factory on Monday morning and an explosion at a factory on Tuesday evening - had local manufacturers worried that their industry was being deliberately targeted. Annisul Huq, former president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that the series of incidents naturally raises questions. A workers' rights group claimed that staff in the factory were working overtime . Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker . Rights Consortium, an American group working to improve conditions at . factories abroad that make clothes for U.S. companies, said: ''The industry and parent brands in the U.S. have been warned again and . again about the extreme danger to workers in Bangladesh and they have . not taken action.' Nova said the . fire was the most deadly in the history of the Bangladesh apparel . industry, and 'one of the worst in any country.' Unsafe: Heaps of damaged garments remaining in the burnt out factory, above. The fire has prompted days of angry protests by workers in the garments industry in Bangladesh . 'There's no question that Walmart and the other customers at this factory bear some blame for what happened in this factory,' Nova said. Nova also said that Walmart 'knew exactly what's going on at these facilities. They have staff on site in Bangladesh.' Linked: Sean 'Diddy' Combs, above, whose ENYCE fashion label is alleged to have used the factory . Walmart actually warned of dangerous conditions at the Tazreen factory last year, in a letter posted online by the factory owner. In a statement, Walmart told ABC News, . 'Our thoughts are with the families of the victims of this tragedy. ... [F]ire safety is a critically important area of Wal-Mart's factory audit . program and we have been working across the apparel industry to improve . fire safety education and training in Bangladesh. 'As part of this effort, we partnered . with several independent organizations to develop and roll out fire . safety training tools for factory management and workers. Continued . engagement is critical to ensure that reliable, proactive measures are . in place to reduce the chance of factory fires.' According to reports, the death toll . is still rising. By Sunday morning, firefighters had recovered 100 . bodies, fire department Operations Director Maj. Mohammad Mahbub said, though the death toll could rise as crews search the charred debris. Another further 12 people who had suffered injuries after jumping from the building to escape the fire later died at hospitals. The cause of the blaze was not immediately clear. Mr Mahbub said the fire broke out on the ground floor, which is used as a warehouse, and spread quickly to the upper floors. 'The factory had three staircases, . and all of them were down through the ground floor,' he said. 'So the . workers could not come out when the fire engulfed the building.

Tragic: Firefighters try to control a fire in a garment factory in Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka . 'Had there been at least one emergency exit through outside the factory, the casualties would have been much lower.'

He said most of the victims had been trapped inside the factory with no emergency exits leading outside the building.

"By . Andy Dolan . UPDATED: . 04:01 EST, 31 October 2011 . They cost as little as Â£15 but have the potential to bring down an airliner. And the chances of handheld laser pointers causing an air disaster are becoming ever more likely, say aviation safety experts. Incidents of lasers being used to target pilots in British airspace have leapt from only 30 in 2007 to 1,600 in the first nine months of this year. Concerning: Incidents of lasers being used to target pilots in British airspace have leapt in recent years . Across Europe, the number of reported incidents quadrupled from 1,048 in 2008 to 4,266 last year, according to Eurocontrol, the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation. The gadgets can beÂ  easily bought online, with some so powerful they can temporarily blind a pilot from six miles away. Interference with commercialÂ  airlines is already a crime in countries such as the U.S., Britain, Sweden and Austria, but no such laws exist across much of the EU. Attack: This image shows a police helicopter being targeted by a powerful laser . A Eurocontrol spokesman said: âLaser interference is growing and presents a global safety and security threat. Doing nothing is not an option.â The watchdog is calling on the EU to develop âstringent regulation on the production, distribution, purchase, carriage and use of lasersâ, while Balpa, the pilotsâ union, wants the laser âweaponsâ to be banned. Worrying: Experts say laser interference is a growing threat for airlines . Laser interference generally involves directing beams at aircraft on take-off or landing, the most critical phases of flight when pilots need to be at their most alert. In several recent cases, pilots have been forced to hand the controls to their co-pilots after being temporarily blinded. Dangerous: This Â£185 laser has a range of 85 miles . The danger is posed either by the laser . being shone directly into the pilotâs eyes, or reflecting off the . cockpit windshield and filling the cabin with light. Last year there were two âvery serious near accidentsâ, where pilots of commercial flights â carrying up to 400 passengers â were forced to hand over to their co-pilots and receive guidance from air traffic control after being temporarily blinded. Convicted: In September last year Radu Moldovan was jailed for four months after shining a green laser beam into the cockpit of an RAF Tornado jet for ten seconds as it came into land at Leuchars in Fife . The most common laser used is green. Handheld models costing around Â£15 and sold through specialist internet . vendors or sites such as eBay produce a beam roughly 60 times stronger . than red handheld laser pointers and can cause temporary damage to the . retina. More powerful lasers capable of causing permanent damage can cost up to Â£1,000 or more. In September last year Radu Moldovan, a Romanian strawberry-picker working in Scotland, was jailed for four months after shining a green laser beam into the cockpit of an RAF Tornado jet for ten seconds as it came in to land at Leuchars in Fife. Only the pilotâs skill prevented a crash. On October 14, hundreds of passengers were put at risk when two flights were targeted 75 minutes apart as they made their final approaches to airports in the West Country. Dave Reynolds, of Balpa, said that while most of the perpetrators are âjust kidsâ, some have been âdisgruntled adultsâ annoyed by aircraft noise. The maximum sentence in the UK for intentionally endangering an aircraft is five yearsâ jail.",Incidents of lasers being used to target pilots in British airspace are increasing .

Two reunited friends set out to check off some items from their 'bucket list' of things they'd never done together and wound up jailed after one of their to-dos was a misdemeanor. Police say Andrea Mobley and Jennifer Morrow face charges after stealing from an Ocala, Florida Walmart on Wednesday. The items? Beef jerky and a bathing suit. A Walmart loss prevention officer told Ocala police officer Charles Hunt she witnessed Mobley eating beef jerky in the store. Meanwhile, Morrow concealed bathing suits inside her purse. Tears in a bucket: Friends Andrea Mobley, left, and Jennifer Morrow, right, were reunited after years apart and decided to celebrate by making a bucket list of things they'd never done together and then do them . Morrow went inside a fitting room and when she came out the duo tried heading for the hills. Thatâs when police were alerted and the two were detained. And the crime due, it appears, were shaking down the local Walmart for old timeâs sake. According to the Ocala Star-Banner, Morrow told Hunt that she and Mobley had been friends for 30 years. For around half that time, theyâd been separated and had only very recently reunited. Morrow said their mini crime spree âwas a bucket list thing on our list of things to do together.â And her friendâs defense? Reports say Mobley, who was wearing the stolen bathing suit underneath her clothes, just wanted to go swimming and didnât have a swimsuit. She called the theft, along with the jerk-eating, âan impulsive thing.â Always low prices: Neither of them had ever shoplifted so, police say, they went to this Ocala, Florida Walmart where Mobley stole some beef jerky and Morrow boosted a swimsuit before they both got caught . The women were arrested and Mobley later posted a $250 bail after they were charged with petty theft. She was released early Thursday morning. Morrow stayed behind and appeared before a judge Thursday. She explained that she and Mobley met as children and parted ways once they were each married but are now living together after recently reconnecting. While apologizing, 38-year-old Morrow said the plans to steal were mutual. âIt's not something I wanted to do, but we both decided to do it,â she said. But Mobley seemed to disagree. Reached by reporters, the 36-year-old pointed the finger at her long lost friend and said it was all Morrowâs idea. âI'm ashamed of this whole situation,â Mobley said. âShe said it would be all right.

To some it may seem like a trivial reason for a diplomatic spat, but a row has broken out between Austria and Slovenia over a regional sausage. The dispute erupted after Slovenia began attempts to get the Krainer sausage special protected EU status - similar to Melton Mowbray pork pies, the Cornish pasty, Champagne and Parmesan.

Dispute: Austria and Slovenia are clashing over and application to get this pork sausage Protected Geographical Indication statud . But Austria insists a cheese-filled variation of the sausage, the Kaesekrainer, belongs to their nation. The two countries are now at loggerheads over who has the best claim to the pork sausage. Slovenia is applying to the European Commission for Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status, because of the meat's connection to the Kranjska region. It would mean only a sausage prepared in that specific region could bear the name Krainer. But Austria has vowed to challenge the bid. Row: If the two nations cannot settle their dispute over the sausage, the European Commission with make a ruling on the issue . âTo rename this beloved speciality is simply impossible.

Plans for a giant new Â£2bn theme park on the edge of London to rival Disneyland Paris have been halted - by a colony of rare spiders. Developers say the Paramount scheme will be the third biggest theme park in the world and twice the size of the Olympic Park. It is due to create 27,000 jobs and was set to be completed by 2019. But an environmental audit of the 872-acre brownfield site in the Swanscombe Peninsula in Kent has found it is home to distinguished jumping spiders. Halted: Plans to build a Â£2bn new theme park to rival Disneyland Paris have been halted after a colony of rare spiders were discovered on the site . Rare: A colony of distinguished jumping spiders, which are found on only two sites in the UK, has been discovered . They are found on only two sites in the UK and are on a biodiversity priority species list. The spiders are one of the few creatures that like the alkaline land created from the cement kiln dust produced by the former works on the site to the east of the Dartford Crossing. London Resort Company Holdings, the consortium behind the theme park, will now have to find a new home for the colony. Tony Sefton, project director for LRCH, yesterday said there are plans to create a 27-acre wetland wildlife park at the park. He said: 'We will look after the spiders. We're doing a good thing. 'The alkaline land is dreadful for most forms of wildlife. But there is this particular spider that likes very alkaline conditions.' Discovery: An environmental audit of the 872-acre brownfield site in the Swanscombe Peninsula in Kent has found it is home to distinguished jumping spiders . Site: The spiders are found on only two sites in the UK, including the site of the proposed theme park, and are on a biodiversity priority species list . He said LRCH hope to find a solution similar to that reached at the London 2012 Olympic Park where species found during development were moved to a wildlife sanctuary. Dartford Borough Council leader Jeremy Kite said there are solutions to preserving unusual species. He said: 'In the past we've moved fish, we've sent voles away on holiday; it's fairly common and protects them from building works. Then when they're finished they're brought back.' The only other UK home for . distinguished jumping spiders, which have the Latin name sitticus . distinguendus, are the West Thurrock marshes in Essex. Both habitats are brownfield sites, or previously developed land. The spiders are on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species list, but the list is not legally binding. Plans: Project director Tony Sefton has said the spiders will be looked after . The ambitious resort will be located in the Swanscombe Peninsula in Kent, currently a brownfield site . This . means the Joint Nature Conservation Committee have deemed the species . is threatened and one that requires conservation action. There . is currently no law preventing developers building on the rare spiders' home although there is a proposal for the species to be added to the . Wildlife and Countryside Act. The 'world-class' venue, supported by Paramount Pictures, will feature Europeâs largest indoor . water park, theatres, live music venues, attractions, cinemas, . restaurants, event space and hotels and, if given the green light, will be . twice the size of Olympic Park in East London. The site is on the doorstep of Ebbsfleet . International railway station, which is 17 minutes from London and two . hours from Paris. Mr Sefton has previously said the plans were Britainâs biggest post-Olympic project. Lucrative: Major films in the Paramount stable include TinTin (left) and Titanic (right) 'Our vision is to create a world-class entertainment destination, the first of its kind in the UK,' he said. 'We are at the start of a long journey, but have been encouraged by the support and buy-in we have had to date. 'We are particularly pleased with the . appetite we are seeing from investors, who consider this a compelling . investment proposition. There are 37 types of jumping spider . in the UK, but worldwide it is the largest spider family containing . over five thousand species. They . have a very large front pair of eyes, and are thought to possess the . best vision for an invertebrate after cephalopods - octopus and . relatives. This vision, along with an ability to jump, allows them to actively hunt their prey during the day. Their keen eyesight also plays a part in courtship, where males can undertake elaborate dances to woo a female. LRCH has signed an . agreement with Paramount Licensing Inc, the licensing division of . Paramount Pictures, to give exclusive UK licensing for a Paramount . entertainment resort at the heart of the site. LRCH is also in negotiations with a range of major British brands to sign licensing agreements. Dartford and Gravesham Borough Councils have both offered support for the project.

Escondido, when Barbara hit as a Category 1 . hurricane about 120 miles (200 kilometers) to the east. He said the man was dragged out by waves kicked up by Barbara and then battered against the shore. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City was not immediately able to confirm the man's name, nationality or hometown.

According to media reports, 14 fishermen disappeared in the state of Oaxaca during the storm, but local emergency services said they could not confirm that information. The hurricane was churning north-northeast at about 9mph and is expected to weaken rapidly overnight, the NHC said. Mr Maza said that very strong winds and intense rainfall had hit the region and that power outages were reported. Mexican state oil monopoly Pemex said that operations were normal at its biggest refinery, located in the port of Salina Cruz. The plant has the capacity to process 330,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Ports for small vessels in the area have been closed and emergency services in Oaxaca said they evacuated residents from some areas as a precaution, including the immediate vicinity of the refinery.

Tropical Storm Barbara became a hurricane in the Pacific as it neared Mexico's southern coast and forged a course towards the country's biggest oil refinery . It drenched the sparsely populated stretch of Mexico with rain after making the second-earliest landfall since reliable record-keeping began in 1966. On May 23, the National Hurricane Center had said odds favoured a below-normal hurricane season in the eastern Pacific for 2013. It said 11 to 16 named storms were likely, below the 15-storm annual average for 1981-2010. But Barbara appeared to start the Pacific season unusually early, and such storms often form closer to the resort of Acapulco, to the west. Officials in Oaxaca had rushed to prepare emergency shelters and suspended school for children in coastal communities as rain began lashing the coast when the storm formed close to shore. The area first hit by the storm is a largely undeveloped stretch of coastal lagoons, punctuated by small fishing villages. The major Gulf oil port of Coatzacoalcos is located on the other side of the narrow waist of Mexico known as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. But the hurricane center predicted Barbara would dissipate into a rain system well before reaching Coatzacoalcos. Maza Sanchez said classes would be suspended at schools along the coast for the rest of the week. Storm shelters were set up in 20 towns and hamlets, and such shelters are often installed at schools.","Man, 61, from Colorado, died while surfing on at Playa Azul .

A fashion-conscious criminal who tried to 'bling' her electronic tag after being inspired by My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding has been fined Â£140. Rebecca Gallanagh used nail glue to spell out her name in fake diamonds on the ankle tag which was meant to ensure she kept her curfew. The 22-year-old has hit out at the justice system for wasting time on her case after she received the fine at Burton Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. Gallanagh was fitted with the . electronic monitor in November after being convicted of a public order . offence when she was involved in a fight outside a nightclub in her home . town of Tamworth, Staffordshire. She . was ordered to observe a strict curfew requiring her to stay at home . between 9pm and 7am for a period of three months, which forced her to . give up her job at a local bar. When . staff from Serco Home Affairs fitted the tag they told her she would be . allowed to decorate it however she wanted, she claims. 'The . lady who fitted the item said she saw a girl from My Big Fat Gypsy . Wedding who had blinged her tag, and she said I could do that,' Gallanagh said. 'I saw pictures of it online and checked the leaflet, and nowhere did it say I couldn't decorate it.' But . when she moved home in December and had to be fitted with a new tag, Serco workers . saw the decoration and reported her to the authorities. The company argued in court that Gallaghan had 'compromised the integrity' of the device with her diamantÃ© design. 'Bling': Gallanagh was inspired by My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding to add decoration to the monitor . Upset: Rebecca, pictured today without her tag, claimed the whole case was a waste of time and money . Magistrates agreed, telling the defendant she had committed a 'very serious offence' and slapping her with a Â£55 fine, along with Â£85 court costs and a Â£20 victim support surcharge. Speaking after her court appearance, Gallaghan said the 'petty' case had gone too far. 'I wouldn't have wasted my time doing it if I knew I was going to be fined for it,' she said. 'It's a massive waste of time and money. There are all these people who go out and breach their orders, and all I've done is decorate my tag - that's just not right. 'I was actually proud of decorating the tag at the time. I wanted to make it look nice while I had it strapped to me around the house, it was a personal thing. Offence: Gallanagh was given the tag after being caught fighting outside a Tamworth nightclub, pictured . 'Serco say I damaged the tag, but I didn't - I didn't touch the sensor, it was still working and I was being monitored. She added: 'I did it to make me feel better about wearing it. I was quite proud of it. I like to bling things up, and wear blingy clothes and watches. It just matched my style.' Her mother April, 48, said: 'It's pathetic. Once her tag was replaced she didn't decorate it again as she had learned her lesson.' Gallaghan's lawyer Mark Moore said: 'This is a young girl who was coming up to Christmas - there were opportunities where she was out and about, and she was trying to make the tag look nice.' Prosecutors for Serco said that decorating the strap 'could affect the device', but confirmed that there had been no other breach of Rebecca's curfew order.","Rebecca Gallanagh forced to observe curfew for fighting outside nightclub .

Survivors of the bloody bomb attacks which struck the Boston Marathon are likely to suffer from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), it has been warned. Bystanders, runners, police and paramedics who were close enough to witness the detonations will be at a higher risk of developing the condition, a leading expert said. Characterised by nightmares, insomnia, a craving for isolation and fear of crowds, PTSD affects tens of thousands of Iran and Afghanistan veterans mentally scarred by the horrors of war. Bloody: Bystanders rush to help those injured in the Boston Marathon terror attacks on Monday afternoon. They and other witnesses now face an increased risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder, an expert warns . Dr Harry Croft, a San Antonio-based psychiatrist, who has treated more than 7,000 former soldiers, said the symptoms would be widespread in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. 'If it lasts more than a month, and has enough symptoms, it is then described as PTSD,' he told NBC News. Initial symptoms often include a sense of disbelief, said Dr Croft, as the experience takes on an almost imaginary aspect. Following that victims either become emotionally numb, or gush with sadness, fear or anger about the horrors they have experienced. Typically, PTSD sufferers have recurrent memories of the event. Or they may just block it out entirely. According to the latest official tally, 183 people were injured and three killed, including one boy of just eight years old, in the terror attack on Monday afternoon. The latest evidence suggests the bombs used were made from pressure cookers packed with explosives and shrapnel, designed to cause the most grievous injuries possible to those caught up in the blasts. Disbelief: According to the latest official tally, 183 people were injured and three killed, including one boy of just eight years old, in the terror attack on Monday afternoon . Experts estimate that one-in-five of those who survive or witness sudden, violent incidents like Monday's atrocities will go on to develop PTSD, although the rate can vary widely among civilians and can depend on the severity of the event. 'Long term, the amount of PTSD is greater with man-made traumas as opposed to those caused by hurricanes, floods and fires,' said Dr Croft. He added that civilians are 'probably' more susceptible than trained soldiers. Nightmare: Experts estimate that one-in-five of those who survive or witness sudden, violent incidents like Monday's atrocities will go on to develop PTSD, although the rate can vary widely among civilians . Thankfully, after a decade of constant war, experts like Dr Croft have developed keener understanding of the condition and the ways it can be treated. 'We know that for some people intensive debriefing after a trauma does not help, and may worsen symptoms in the long run,' he said. 'But getting survivors to safety, helping them understand what has happened, helping them talk â or be quiet but around others â may be of great value.' Aside from talking therapies, PTSD sufferers are are commonly treated with drugs including including antipsychotics, antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications. However, there is currently no specific treatment for PTSD and related disorders. The high suicide rate among former soldiers is often blamed on the condition.","Symptoms are nightmares, insomnia, craving for isolation and fear of crowds .

After beating his 70-year-old mom to death, police say a Florida man dismembered her body, scattered the pieces in the woods and escaped to Brooklyn, N.Y., with the rest of his family. Authorities arrested Francis Riccio, 45, in Brooklyn Thursday two months after his mother was killed and after a two-week investigation by the local sheriff's office with the New York City Police Department, according to Florida Today. Riccio is charged in the first-degree murder of his mother, Maureen Riccio, as well as the abuse of her dead body. Police say Riccio murdered his mother when he became stressed by her medical problems. Arrested: Police charged Francis Riccio, left, for brutally killing his 70-year-old mother, Maureen Riccio, right, and scattering pieces of her body near woods in Florida two months ago . Originally from New York, Riccio's mother moved to Florida late last year to live with him, his girlfriend and their three children, according to the Orlando Sentinel. '[Riccio] said [his mother is] kind of . schizophrenic, she flipped out here and there. He was talking about how . he wanted to send her back up north,' neighbor Richard Lucas told WKMG Local 6. 'I kind of thought something was wrong about his momma, but I didn't know for sure.' Neighbors told police things at their shared house in Melbourne, Fla., became tense between Riccio, his mother and his girlfriend when Riccio couldn't find a nursing facility for her. 'What we believe happened was sometime in late March, an argument escalated between our victim, her son and this female,' Maj. Tod Goodyear, of the Brevard County Sheriff's Office, told Florida Today. 'It became violent, whereupon the son beat his mother to death.' Police say Riccio used a hammer or another instrument to kill her and dismembered her body for easier transport, according to Florida Today. Authorities believe Riccio discarded the pieces a few days after her death, putting them in garbage bags and scattering them along and within a wood south of their home. Ditched: An electrical technician found some of the dismembered remains of 70-year-old Maureen Riccio along the side of the road and woods in Micco, Fla., sparking a two-week investigation into her murder . He then cleaned the house, painted a bedroom, sold his truck and moved his family a thousand miles away in early April, police say. Riccio and his girlfriend, who he has been with for 20 years, pulled their children out of school for the move, saying there had been a death in the family. Authorities say their children, two teens and a 10-year-old, didn't appear to know anything had happened to their grandmother, though WKMG Local 6 reported deputies believe the children were home during the murder. Authorities began investigating Ms. Riccio's death when an electrical technician saw some of her remains on the side the road when he stopped to pee on May 14. After weeks searching the woods, police were able to find her entire body, Florida Today reports. Goodyear told Florida Today the NYPD was already investigating Riccio for selling stolen goods on Craigslist. When authorities found the family, they questioned Riccio's girlfriend, but she has not been charged. 'It can be very hard sometimes to take care of elderly parents,' Goodyear told Florida Today. 'It can be very frustrating, but I think thatâs one of the things we sign on for as sons and daughters.' Riccio is being held by authorities without bond, but will eventually be transferred to Brevard County.","Francis Riccio, 45, was frustrated by his mom's medical problems, police say .

A 14-year-old who ordered her boyfriend to stab a schoolboy for 'disrespecting' her was locked up for eight years yesterday. Cherelle McKenzie-Jackson scowled and sucked her teeth as she and Marc Anthony Tulloch, 17, were sentenced for the manslaughter of 15-year-old Junior Nkwelle. Tulloch, who stabbed Junior through the heart, received a ten-year sentence. The Old Bailey heard the attack took place last September, after McKenzie-Jackson was challenged for walking across a football pitch with friends during a match in which Junior was playing. Stabbing: Cherelle McKenzie-Jackson, left, telephoned her boyfriend Marc Anthony Tulloch, 17, right, and ordered him to come and attack Junior Nkwelle . She claimed he had insulted her during the ensuing row, and then called Tulloch, ordering him to 'teach Junior a lesson'. McKenzie-Jackson went home to fetch a . kitchen knife, before returning to the scene in Brixton, south London. When Tulloch arrived, he stabbed Junior once, piercing his heart and . lung. Victim: Young footballer Junior Nkwelle who was stabbed in a row over a girl walking across a football pitch . The youngster collapsed yards from his . home, and was pronounced dead an hour later. Prosecutor Jonathan Turner . QC said the row between the teenagers 'was stupid and trivial and . completely unnecessary'. He added: '[McKenzie-Jackson] thought . that Junior had insulted her or been less than respectful to her. She . was very angry and determined that he should be punished â indeed . stabbed â to put things right. 'She called up her boyfriend and was heard to tell Junior that she had arranged for somebody to come and stab him.' Judge Richard Hone QC lifted an order . banning identification of the killers, in the hope that their sentencing . would act as a deterrent. 'I bear in mind the public interest in . the reduction of knife crime, rightly regarded as the scourge of our . cities,' he said. 'These are very grave offences.' The killers were cleared of murder last month, but found guilty of manslaughter. A jury rejected the claim that . Junior's stabbing was an act of self-defence, with Judge Hone stating: . 'The CCTV evidence shows this is not a case where self-defence is a . realistic possibility.' He said he was confident that . McKenzie-Jackson 'orchestrated the chain of events that led to Junior . Nkwelle's tragic death', adding that she was only spared a longer . sentence because of her age. The court heard she was 'physically and behaviourally more mature' than most girls her age. Victim: Junior Nkwelle, 15, who was stabbed through the heart by Marc Anthony Tulloch on the Loughborough Estate in Brixton, south London . She was described as a known . troublemaker at school and at home, where she lived with a grandmother . who struggled to control her. Judge Hone told her: 'You had a . disturbed time [at school], exhibiting offensive behaviour and verbal . abuse, and were involved in the physical assault of another girl during . the summer holidays. 'You were unruly and disruptive. Your mother could not cope, so for that reason you were staying with your grandmother.' Neither she nor Tulloch â who had been stabbed before, and whose brother was murdered â had previous criminal convictions. Last night Junior's mother Stella Muma said she was still struggling to come to terms with her son's death. She said: 'It doesn't make any sense to me. It happened so quickly and so close to our home. 'I didn't even know what was going on and I had no chance to help, or see him and say goodbye and tell him how much I love him. 'By the time I got to him my poor child had bled to death. 'I can only describe Junior as a kind, . friendly boy who always had a smile on his face. He was a fantastic . footballer and a great student who loved school. He was a good son and a . wonderful companion, brother and role model to his younger brothers.'

On the BBCâs Newsnight, Labourâs deputy leader made an apparent attempt to gain political capital out of the crisis by urging ministers to âthink againâ about their policies. Her comments followed those by Ken Livingstone and Left-wing Labour MPs who have blamed cuts â particularly to youth services â for the violence and looting. Clash: Harriet Harman and Michael Gove had a furious exchange of views on Newsnight on Tuesday evening, with Miss Harman accused of trying to make political gain from the riots . Miss Harman said: âThere is a sense that young people feelÂ  they are not being listened to. That is not to justify violence. âBut when youâve got the trebling of tuition fees, they should think again about that. âWhen youâve got the EMA (Educational Maintenance Allowance paid to encourage 16-to-18-year olds to encourage them to stay in full-time education) being taken away.

A second killer crocodile is feared to be on the loose around the Costa del Sol, days after one was found dead following sightings of a large reptile in the area. Fresh footprints found near the resort of Mijas, near Marbella in southern Spain, do not match those of the seven-foot-long reptile earlier this week. The gardener who last month raised the alarm after spotting the creature - dubbed the Costa Croc - also insisted he had seen a bigger animal than the one that was found. Dead: But authorities in the Spanish resort Mijas are now hunting a second Costa Croc after finding fresh footprints that do not match those of the dead reptile discovered on Tuesday . Mijas mayor Angel Nozal said: 'We've been told the first footprints found do not appear to coincide with the dead animal's. The search is continuing.' The lakes where the first crocodile was found, known as Majada Vieja, are near the summer homes of actor Pierce Brosnan and veteran singer Julio Iglesias. They are also overlooked by holiday apartments where hundreds of British tourists stay at any one time. Signs remain in place around the lakes, a favourite walking and jogging spot next to a golf club popular with holidaymakers, saying in Spanish: 'Grave danger. Crocodile on the loose.' No so snappy now: An animal expert and local police discovered the corpse of the animal they identified as the Costa Croc on Tuesday as they patrolled the area discussing ways to track down the beast . A watch tower had also been erected over fears the reptile would pose a serious danger as it got warmer and came out of hibernation to look for food. An animal expert and local police discovered the corpse of the animal they identified as the Costa Croc on Tuesday as they patrolled the area discussing ways to track down the beast. The seven-foot-long reptile - thought to be around 15 years old - was identified as a Nile crocodile, a species which is widespread throughout Africa. Police are still hunting its former owner who is believed to have abandoned it after tiring of his exotic pet. It's believed the animal died from a head injury after a fall. Council officials said they plan to seek permission to stuff it so they can display it to tourists. 'Grave danger! Crocodile on the loose': Signs put up by Spanish police around the lake in Mijas remain in place warning tourists to beware of a crocodile on . the loose in the area. But many have ignored them . Despite the dangers, many British ex-pats and holidaymakers had ignored police warnings to wander the lakes in the hope of spotting the croc. As they search was continuing last month, ex-pat Rose Bell, restaurant manager at El Soto Golf Club next to the lake, said: 'The police have already been to see us and warned us a crocodile is on the loose. 'We thought they were joking at first but now the signs have gone up, we can see they're taking it seriously. 'We're still intending [to go] down there after work most nights to see if we can spot it. I've been told they can run fast but I'll make sure I run faster if I come across it. I suspect it will turn out to be a caiman.' Relaxing: Marbella is a popular holiday destination for thousands of British tourists . Costa del Crocodiles: A resort popular with British holidaymakers, Mijas is on Spain's Mediterranean coast between Malaga and Marbella. Many holidaymakers have ignored warnings to look for the animals . Richard Seamark, who manages the golf shop, added: 'Most of our British clients think it's a bit of a joke really. After all the hoo-hah with horse meat, we're thinking of offering croc-burgers if we catch it. 'We've had problems in the past with wild boar and put up fencing round the golf course five years ago because they were coming in and digging up the greens looking for food. We never thought though they might be a good crocodile deterrent.' The lake the crocodile was spotted by is one of three man-made lakes overlooked by hundreds of apartments whose owners are 80 per cent British. The area was badly damaged by wildfires over the last two summers. Mijas town hall spokesman Mario Bravo said last month: 'We don't believe the reptile will be a danger to human beings unless it feels intimidated or threatened. 'The main danger would be if someone accidentally trod on it in the undergrowth or tried to capture it because they want to take it home or gain fame as the person who caught it. 'Police are patrolling the area on motorbikes every day in the hope of spotting it but we know it's an animal that isn't that active in winter and won't start showing itself much until the weather gets warmer.' Now, with spring getting underway, there is a danger the second crocodile could be preparing to venture from its winter hiding place.","Fresh footprints do not match those of beast found dead on Monday .

A set of 26-year-old twins have stunned doctors by both suffering strokes just months apart from each other. Kathryn Tucker, who lives in Tempe, Arizona, felt a sharp pain on the back of her head as she got into bed last July - just nine months before her non-identical twin, Kimberley, felt the same pain. Both women also suffered a loss of vision and numbness down their body, but for Kathryn, the pain occurred on the right side, while for Kimberley, it occurred on the left. Medical staff said that for both of the women - who are fraternal twins - to suffer a stroke at such a young age is 'like lightning striking twice', especially as they had no family history of the condition. Alike: Twins Kathryn (left) and Kimberly Tucker, 26, suffered strokes nine months apart from each other . It is a common misconception only the elderly suffer strokes; in fact, one third of sufferers are under 65 and people younger than 45, the stroke risk has jumped 14 to 20 per cent, experts said. While Kathryn and Kimberley are both active women, they increased their risk by smoking and taking the contraceptive pill. They had both previously suffered migraines and Kathryn also had a small, previously undetected hole in her heart. Despite the prevalence of strokes among young people, doctors did not at first diagnose Kathryn correctly, ABC News reported. When she suffered the pain in her head, loss of vision and numbness, her brother rushed her to hospital, where doctors believed she was just suffering a migraine and sent her home. 'I was absolutely terrified,' she told ABC. 'I slept for three days straight. Then, when I woke up, my vision was horrible. Everything was distorted and one-dimensional. I could barely get around.' Treatment: They received treatment at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, pictured, and have undergone therapy. They still sufferer with vision issues but are otherwise back to full health . Stroke is a leading cause of . death in the U.S., claiming the lives of nearly 130,000 Americans each year, . according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About one-third of strokes are believed to occur in people younger than 65, and for people younger than 45, the stroke risk has jumped 14 to 20 percent, according to Dr. Joni Clark, a vascular neurologist at Barrow Neurological Institute. It means that about about one in five victims is now below the age of 55. Symptoms include sudden numbness or . weakness in the face, arm or leg, sudden confusion, sudden vision loss . and dizziness, and sudden severe headache. Risk is increased by alcohol and drug consumption and by smoking. Experts also believe the increasing number of young sufferers is due to the rise in diabetes, obesity and high cholesterol. Eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and getting blood pressure checks can help reduce the chance of suffering a stroke. She was sent to an urgent care facility, where she learned she had had a stroke. Kimberly left school in Tuscon to take care of Kathryn - but nine months later, their roles reversed. After running in a 5k race, Kimberly returned home feeling thirsty and tired. But when she awoke, she felt a sharp pain at the back of her head and was suffering poor vision and jumbled thoughts. Yet because of her sister's experience, she knew she was having a stroke - although medical staff initially disagreed. 'The EMTs told me that the chance of . both me and my sister having a stroke this young was that of being . struck by lightning twice,' she said. Dr. Joni Clark, a vascular neurologist at Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, told ABC that it was indeed very rare for the two sisters, who do not share DNA, to suffer strokes at a young age. 'Honestly, it's rare for us to actually evaluate two sisters who've had strokes within months of each other,' she said. 'If they had a family history, it would not be a surprise. It's quite uncommon.' She added that most of the cases among young people are spontaneous, and can be brought on my obesity and the diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol that is associated with it. The twins said they have both stopped smoking and taking the pill. They have undergone occupational and speech therapy, but their vision is still . affected and they cannot drive. 'We think we are invincible until we are not,' Kimberly said. 'This taught us a huge lesson that we are not guaranteed great health and we need to take care of our bodies.'","Kathryn Tucker suffered a stroke in August last year - nine months before her twin Kimberly did .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 01:23 EST, 31 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:18 EST, 31 May 2013 . Chilling video from Chicago reveals the moment a Lebanese immigrant planted a bomb near iconic Wrigley Field - hoping to kill dozens of revelers in September 2010. Fortunately, the bomb was a fake, supplied to him by undercover FBI agents. However, authorities say that if it had been real, it would have made the Boston Marathon bombings look like a 'minor incident.' A federal judge on Thursday sentenced Sami Samir Hassoun, a 25-year-old Lebanese immigrant, to 23 years in prison for the planting what he believed was a paint can bomb wrapped in C4 and filled with shrapnel. Caught: This is the moment Samir Hassoun dropped a backpack, containing what he thought was a bomb that would level a city block, into a garbage can on a crowded Chicago street . Hassoun coldly carried the backpack from his car to the crowded street. He was being monitored the entire time by FBI agents . 'Let's give the elephant in the room a name: It's called the Boston . Marathon,' U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman said. 'What would have happened had his bomb been . real would have made Boston look like a minor incident.' Indeed, Houssoun's plot has shades of the April 15 attack on the Boston Marathon in which three people died and dozens were injured and maimed when two pressure cooker bombs in backpacks were planted near the finish line. Samir Hassoun, 25, was sentenced to 23 years in prison for the attempted bomb attack . Hassoun dropped a backpack containing the bomb in a trashcan near an 'L' train stop in the bustling Wrigleyville neighborhood of Chicago near the Chicago Cubs' stadium. Hassoun was told by undercover FBI agents, the prosecutor said, that it would destroy half the city block and kill dozens of people. Minutes before the sentence was announced, Hassoun, a 25-year-old one-time Chicago baker and candy-store worker, apologized for what he'd done in a five-minute statement. Crying, he asked the judge if he could address his family and friends, and then turned to look at them on a nearby bench. 'I am sorry for the actions that I made and the shame I brought on you,' Hassoun said, struggling to keep his composure. 'I promise I will become a better person... and make it up to you.' His mother sobbed aloud and when Hassoun finished, she said in an audible voice to her son, 'I love you!' Gettleman said he accepted the defense depiction of Hassoun as a uniquely gullible youth and that an informant may have been eager to please his FBI handlers by leading him on â though the judge said that was no excuse for Hassoun's crime. During the hearing, prosecutors played secret video recordings of Hassoun during the sting in which he talks about killing people. He explains that one reason to stage the attack along bar-strewn Clark Street is that late-night revelers will be so drunk they wouldn't notice him dropping a bomb into the trash bin. In another chilling video shown in court, Hassoun smiles and hums a tune to himself on the night of Saturday, September 18, 2010 - moments before heading off to what he thought would be a major terrorist attack. 'You feel good?' an undercover agent asks. 'Yeah, I'm (doing) great man,' Hassoun responds. In another video, Hassoun rambles incoherently about then-Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley and the need to overthrow him in a revolution. 'When you see Mr. Hassoun on these tapes, all you can think of is that â this guy is really out to lunch,' Gettleman said before turning to look at Hassoun. 'I don't know what was going through your mind â and maybe you didn't know either.' This is the bar near Wrigley Field that would have been directly in the blast of the bomb Hassoun planted . Prosecutors also played a surveillance video of Hassoun, wearing a black hoodie, dropping the device into a trash bin at about 12.20am on September 19, 2010 â while people crowded the sidewalk and music blared from area bars. FBI agents arrested him moments later. As part of an agreement with the government, Hassoun pleaded guilty last year to two explosives counts. In return, he faced a sentencing range of 20 to 30 years, rather than a maximum term of life in prison. One of Hassoun's attorneys, Alison Siegler, argued in court Thursday that the difference between two decades and three decades behind bars was enormous â and that a sentence of around 20 years would give Hassoun the chance to start a family, to go to school and see his parents as a free man again. After court adjourned, Hassoun appeared to express relief as he smiled and hugged his attorney. Before Thursday's sentencing, Hassoun also apologized in a seven-page letter to Gettleman. He also insisted he's worked hard at becoming a better person, including by doing yoga in jail. The Beirut-born Hassoun blamed his actions in part on childhood trauma living in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. During civil strife there, Hassoun, then 11, witnessed machete killings from an apartment balcony, he wrote. His family moved from Lebanon to the U.S. in 2008. To dampen his lingering emotional pain, he wrote that he drank alcohol 'all day, every day' for months before the would-be stadium attack in 2010. He favored whole bottles of Johnnie Walker Black, he wrote. The bomb was planted in the shadow of the Cubs' Wrigley Field in a popular nighttime area . The defense suggested investigators may have come close to entrapping Hassoun, arguing the informant egged Hassoun on to acquiesce to ever-more ominous-sounding plots. '(The informant) preyed on Sami's fantasies ... and agents helped make that fantasy come true,' another of Hassoun's attorney's, Matthew Madden, told the court Thursday. 'If left to his own devices, nobody would ever have heard of Sami Hassoun.' Prone to boasting and eager to impress, Hassoun even made absurd claims he could make a gun out of two pieces of wood and a spring, and a bomb out of baking soda, Madden said. But so inept was Hassoun, he bought a backpack, walkie-talkies and some batteries agents asked him to buy and the FBI then incorporated it into the dud bomb fashioned at its lab in Quantico, Virginia, he added. Prosecutors concede Hassoun did waffle about his plans, allegedly talking about profiting monetarily and then broaching the idea of poisoning Lake Michigan or assassinating Daley. But prosecutors say Hassoun himself concluded that maximum damage could be inflicted by a blast next to the popular Sluggers World Class Sports Bar, just steps from Wrigley Field. 'Undercover agents also repeatedly asked Hassoun if he wanted to back out, telling him there would be no shame in doing so. But he repeatedly declined, saying he wanted to press ahead,' Hammerman told the court Thursday. 'It was his understanding that in 15 minutes (after placing the backpack in the bin), there would be death and carnage all over Clark Street,' the prosecutor said.","Samir 'Sami' Hassoun, 25, believed the bomb he planted on a crowded Chicago street in September 2010 would have destroyed a city block .

Ed Miliband has said Labour will stand on its most Left-wing economic manifesto since the Kinnock era at the next election . Ed Miliband made clear last night that at the next election Labour will stand on its most Left-wing economic manifesto since the Kinnock era. He announced that a future Labour government would be âvery differentâ from those of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The Labour leader signalled that he would seek to build a âdifferent economyâ from the plans pursued by New Labour and the Coalition. Mr Miliband said he has âlearned lessonsâ from New Labourâs approach to business and the City and said he would aim to water down the importance of financial services in the economy. In an interview with the BBC, he laid out plans to impose more regulation, tax bankers more heavily and build âa different banking systemâ. Mr Miliband made clear that the party is prepared to offer economic plans at the next general election that are unabashedly more Left-wing than any Labour manifesto since the 1992 election when Neil Kinnock was the partyâs leader. He insisted that he would not return the party to its socialist roots but indicated that he wants to target bankers, who were courted by the Blair government. He said: âIâll say something very clear to you. Itâs going to be very different from the Labour government of 1997 to 2010. New Labour did great things. New Labour took on some of the issues that Mrs Thatcher had left behind, and had done bad things to the country; in public services and elsewhere. âWeâre not going back to, for example, nationalisation, and mass public ownership. New Labour was right about that. âBut weâve learnt lessons. The financial crisis, that teaches us a lesson about deregulation, about banks, about ourÂ  economy being too reliant on financial services.â Mr Miliband announced that a future Labour government would be âvery differentâ from those of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, and signalled he would seekÂ  âdifferent economyâ than that of New Labour and the Coalition . Mr Milibandâs aides have signalled that he is prepared to go into the next election offering to spend more money than the Coalition in 2015/16. They are wrestling with devising policies at a time when the straitened economic situation mean it is politically impossible to offer traditional socialist tax and spend policies. But Mr Miliband signalled that Labour would seek to tax bankers to pay for more state intervention in the economy. âThere will be much less money around,â he admitted. âIt will be tough times. What would I do on day one as prime minister? Get our young people working again. How would I do it? Tax the bankersâ bonuses and put our young people back to work.

Inspire magazine, the online English-language publication, applauds the actions of the Boston bombers, as well as the ricin-laced letters mailed to President Obama and various elected officials. In an article entitled, 'Message to the American nation,' al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) commander Qassem al-Rimi says: 'The Boston events, the road accidents and the poisoned letters, disregard of the people behind them indicate that the control of your security has broken away.'

These incredible images show the craggy mountainside where Curiosity, Nasaâs Â£1.6billion planetary explorer, hopes to discover signs that life once existed on Mars. The six-wheeled rover, which landed earlier this month, will edge its way to the foot of the mountain, 6.2 miles away, to scratch around in the dirt, dust and soil. Scroll down for video . Incredible: This colour image from Nasa's Curiosity shows the base of Mount Sharp, the rover's eventual science destination . In Curiosity's second drive, it . rotated about 90 degrees, drove about 16 feet (5 meters), then rotated . back about 120 degrees to face roughly the same direction from which it . started. Nasa officials said it placed Curiosity directly over a patch where one of the . spacecraftâs landing engines scoured away a few inches of gravelly soil . and exposed underlying rock. Researchers plan to use a . neutron-shooting instrument on the rover to check for water molecules . bound into minerals at this partially excavated target, they said. Chemical analysis of those samples . should reveal whether Mars ever had the organic materials that could . support life and may help answer one of the greatest questions of . science: is life unique to Earth or did it once exist elsewhere in the . Solar System? Science fiction writers have . speculated about intelligent Martians since Victorian times. However, . scientists nowÂ  suspect that the Red Planet is dead â but that it may . once have been home to alien bacteria or moss. Bugs and moss might not sound like . intelligent little green men, but their one-time presence would mean . that life has evolved â orÂ  been deposited by comets orÂ  asteroids â on . two of the eightÂ  planets of our Solar System. And if life is relatively common in our small corner of the galaxy, then surely the universe must be teeming with it. The latest images are the most . detailed yet from the nuclear- powered 2,000lb Curiosity, which landed . in the Gale Crater, south of Marsâs equator. They show layers of rocks â similar . to the red and grey tiers of the Grand Canyon in Arizona in the US â . near the base of the three-mile-high Mount Sharp at the centre of the . 96-mile-wide crater. The colour of one of the images â . taken by Curiosityâs 100mmÂ  telephoto camera, one of 17 on board â is . enhanced to show the scene under the same lighting conditions here on . Earth, which helps scientists to analyse the terrain. Previous surveys of Mars have shown the layers contain claysÂ  and other minerals that usually form in the presence of water. Although Mars is now a desert planet, millions of years ago its surface was carved by oceans, lakes and waterfalls. The gravelly land in the foreground . of the main picture is the landing area, named Bradbury Landing in . tribute to the American science fiction writer, Ray Bradbury, who died . in June. The ground eventually rises up to the . edge of a crater, behind which lies a field of darker dunes leading up . to the bottom of Mount Sharp. Mast camera: This image, taken by the Mast Camera, highlights the geology of Mount Sharp, a mountain inside Gale Crater, where the rover landed . Mars surface: The MastCam data now reveal a strong discontinuity in the strata above and below the line of white dots . NASA Administrator Charles Bolden also had a recorded speech played from the rover on the surface of Mars. He said: 'The knowledge we hope to gain from our observation and analysis of Gale Crater will tell us much about the possibility of life on Mars as well as the past and future possibilities for our own planet. 'Curiosity will bring benefits to Earth and inspire a new generation of scientists and explorers, as it prepares the way for a human mission in the not too distant future.' The peak of the mountain is ten miles . away. What has intrigued Nasa about these pictures is the peculiar . nature of the layers of rock on the mountainside.Although those near the crater floor . are horizontal, the onesÂ  higher up have been twisted by geological . forces over millions of years and are sharply inclined â exactly the . reverse of similar features found on Earth. In the Grand Canyon, for instance, . the rock layers near the bottom have been buckled and tilted by the . movement of the Earthâs tectonic plates. But the more recent layers on . top are horizontal. The difference on Mars suggests layers of rock were deposited quickly by violent winds or currents. As well as the surprising tilt of the . Martian rocks, their composition has intrigued scientists who plan to . use the roverâs array of gadgets to seek out signs of past, or current, . life in the layers of rock. Among these are the ChemCam, which uses a laser to vaporise soil and rock samples before analysing their chemical make-up. However, anyone hoping for a quick . answer to the question of life will be disappointed. For the rover will . take nearly a year to trundle over to the mountainside. Eventually, Nasa wants to send a manned mission and its publicity machine is eager to whip up enthusiasm for all things Mars. That explains why yesterday, at 9pm, . the space agency was preparing to broadcast a new track by Black Eyed . Peas singer Will.i.am from the rover. It was â Nasa informed the world â the first time a pop song has been broadcast on another planet. What any hiding Martians will think, heaven knows. Letâs just hope they donât mistake it for a declaration of war. Nasa also released a new colour panorama showing a 360-degree view of Curiosity's landing site, including the highest part of Mount Sharp visible to the rover .

Researchers have discovered that an unassuming 5,000 year old ancient Egyptian artefact hides an incredible secret - it was made from a meteorite. It is an important find as it explains how ancient Egyptians obtained iron millennia before the earliest evidence of iron smelting in the region, something that has confounded scientists until now. It also unearths a tantalising glimpse of the genesis of the ancient Egyptians' religion and the divine attributes they attached to meteorites. 'The sky was very important to the ancient Egyptians,' says Joyce Tyldesley, an Egyptologist at the University of Manchester, UK, and a co-author of the paper on the discovery. 'Something that falls from the sky is going to be considered as a gift from the gods.' Heaven-sent: The iron bead that unlocked the mystery surrounding the presence of iron among the ancient Egyptians. It also poses exciting questions about the way the cosmos influenced their religion . The evidence comes from strings of iron beads which were excavated in 1911 at the Gerzeh cemetery, a burial site approximately 70km south of Cairo. Dating from 3350 to 3600 BC, thousands of years before Egyptâs Iron Age, the bead analysed was originally assumed to be from a meteorite owing to its composition of nickel-rich iron. But this hypothesis was challenged in the 1980s when academics proposed that much of the early worldwide examples of iron use originally thought to be of meteorite-origin were actually early smelting attempts. To settle the argument, Diane Johnson, a meteorite scientist at the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK, and her colleagues used scanning electron microscopy and computed tomography to analyse one of the beads, which they borrowed from the museum. They found areas where the weathered surface had fallen away, providing what Johnson describes as 'little windows' to the preserved metal beneath, reportsÂ Nature. The iron beads contained a unique 'fingerprint' that shows they are from a meteorite . The nickel content of this original metal was found to be high, suggesting that it did indeed come from a meteorite. The researcher also observed that the metal had a distinctive crystalline structure called a WidmanstÃ¤tten pattern. This structure is found only in iron meteorites that cooled extremely slowly inside their parent asteroids as the Solar System was forming. Philip Withers, Professor of Materials . Science at The University of Manchester, added: 'Meteorites have a . unique microstructural and chemical fingerprint because they cooled incredibly . slowly as they travelled through space. It was really interesting to . find that fingerprint turn up in Egyptian artefacts.' Divine: The ancient Egyptians would have seen a meteorite as an offering from the gods . Ms Johnson said the research highlights the application of modern technology to ancient materials not only to understand meteorites better but also to help us understand what ancient cultures considered these materials to be and the importance they placed upon them.' Meteorite iron had profound implications for the ancient Egyptians, both in their perception of the iron in the context of its celestial origin and in early metallurgy attempts. Dr Tyldesley added: 'Today, we see iron first and foremost as a practical, rather dull metal. To the ancient Egyptians, however, it was a rare and beautiful material which, as it fell from the sky, surely had some magical/religious properties. 'They therefore used this remarkable metal to create small objects of beauty and religious significance which were so important to them that they chose to include them in their graves.'","Necklace found to be made from meteorite fragment .

The lyrics were taken from First World War poems by Wilfred Owen and also form part of Matthew Picton's map . Picton used pages from novels by Graham Greene, Rosie Alison, Elizabeth Bowen and Christopher Fowler to show Second World War London following the bombing raids by German aircraft. His technique of burning the paper where destruction was left injects the maps with character - making them seem more like an aerial view of the damage than just an outline of the streets and giving each city a sense of personality. Another wartime-based creation shows Coventry after the city suffered its own Blitz, made of paper bearing the music for Benjamin Britten's War Requiem. Britten composed the requiem for the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral, which was built next to the ruins of the one destroyed in the war. In this paper sculpture, the German city of Dresden is recreated to show how it looked after it was bombed by Allies in February 1945 . Matthew Picton's sculpture attempts to recreate the damage in Dresden following the bombs, seen her in February 1945 . Britten's music and the lyrics, taken from work by First World War poet Wilfred Owen, form the walls and streets of Coventry in Picton's creation. He also acknowledges the destruction at Dresden in 1945 left by Allied bombers, using burnt copies of the score to Wagner's Ring cycle and singeing the ground of the map to show where bombs landed. Elsewhere, the artist turned to pages . from Daniel Defoe's Journal of the Plague Years to make London in 1666, . based on a map of the time of the Great Fire which began in a baker's . and raged for days, destroying thousands of homes and St Paul's Cathedral, which went on to survive the Blitz. His modern day work includes a dazzling . Las Vegas, electrified by neon paint and made using pages of Hunter S . Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, while a sculpture of lower . Manhattan shows the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001. Artist Matthew Picton created a 3D map of London in the time of the Great Fire in 1666 out of book covers of Daniel Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year . A painting of London in September 1666 - now Matthew Picton has recreated a map of the time out of book covers . The dark patch of scorched earth at the end of the island dominates the piece, which was built from newspaper headlines in the days following the hijacking of four planes, two of which hit the World Trade Centre's twin towers. Pages from Philip Roth's The Plot Against America also made up blocks and buildings in the creation. Picton was born in England, . studied at the London School of Economics and is now based in Oregon in the United States. He . told Dazed Digital: 'I think my interest in [maps] was born out of . walking, the imagination of place that maps create in the mind and a . long term fascination with travel, landscape and geography.'

Using the pages torn from Thompson's novel, depicting hedonism in Las Vegas, helped Picton in his mission to make maps seem more representative of the cities they show . The luminescent yellow of Picton's Las Vegas map mimics the bright lights of the city itself .

Argentinean President Cristina Fernandez Kirchner has been barred from attending Baroness Thatcher's funeral, 31 years after the Falklands conflict . Argentine President Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner has been barred from Baroness Thatcherâs funeral. However, the country's ambassador to Britain Alicia Castro has been invited, diplomatic sources revealed. Details began to emerge today of the current and former world leaders invited to attend the service at St Paulâs Cathedral next Wednesday. Celebrities invited include Jeremy Clarkson, Dam Shirley Bassey and Sir Terry Wogan. But in an indication of the fraught diplomatic tensions over who to invite, President Kirchner has been vetoed. After discussions with the Thatcher family it has been agreed to extend a formal invitation to the Argentine ambassador, in line with the protocol of inviting a representative from every country with whom Britain has diplomatic relations. While most countries have been left to choose who their representative might be, Whitehall officials have made clear to Argentina that President Kirchner is not welcome after her recent attempts to reignite the struggle for control of the Falkland Islands. Baroness Thatcher, who died on Monday aged 87, is to receive a war leader's send-off dominated by regiments and military units which played a crucial role in the 1982 conflict in the South Atlantic. The former Premier's coffin will be carried into St Paul's Cathedral by those who fought to free the Falkland Islands. Pall-bearers will be from the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force regiments who helped defeat Argentinian forces to liberate the South Atlantic islands in 1982, which was the Iron Lady's greatest moment in Downing Street. With tensions over the islands still running high, Argentinaâs President Kirchner has been blocked from next week's funeral. A senior government source said: âIt is being done by invitation and therefore we have some discretion. There is obviously the Falklands issue. âIn the case of Argentina we have obviously made clear that it is an invitation for the ambassador, they are not left to nominate. 'Lady Thatcher was always someone who believed in protocol and doing things properly and that was very much the feeling of the family.' War leader's funeral: Baroness Thatcher will be carried into St Paul's by units linked to the Falklands War . Honoured: A British Royal Marine watches over captured Argentine soldiers following the Battle of Goose Green, during which Lieutenant Colonel Herbert 'H' Jones, 42, was fatally wounded. He would later be awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his valiance . Final decisions about arrangements for the funeral are still being drawn up by the Whitehall committee - codenamed True Blue. Sir Mark Thatcher, the former Premier's son, is expected to attend a meeting of the committee tomorrow. But organisers have already made clear that the military will play a major part, with 700 armed forces personnel involved. Among them will be Welsh Guards, the regiment who suffered the heaviest losses in the war, whose members will also form a guard of honour as her body is taken into the cathedral at 11am on Wednesday. David Cameron told the Commons yesterday that Baroness Thatcher's funeral would be a fitting tribute to the late Premier . Paras who fought at Goose Green and took Port Stanley, Royal Marines who made the first landings on the islands and servicemen who flew to protect British troops or bomb Argentine targets will also take Lady Thatcher on her final journey. David Cameron told the Commons yesterday: 'Her coffin will be draped with the flag that she loved, it will be placed on a gun carriage and taken to St Paul's Cathedral and members of all three services will line the route. 'In a week from now, as people gather in London to lay Margaret Thatcher to rest, the sun will be rising over the Falklands. And because of her courage, and the skill, bravery and sacrifice of our armed forces - it will rise again for freedom.' Outside the cathedral when the gun . carriage is drawn up there will be a guard of honour from the 1st . Battalion Welsh Guards together with the Welsh Guards band. As her coffin is taken to the door of St Paul's, guns will be fired every minute from the Tower of London. The Welsh Guards will be centre-stage next Wednesday as Britain says farewell to Mrs Thatcher. 32 . of them were among 48 members of the British forces who died when troop . ship Sir Galahad was bombed by the Argentines in May 1982 in Britain's . worst loss of the war. Simon . Weston, who was badly wounded and left with 46 per cent burns in the . incident, said his regiment's key involvement is 'very fitting'. 'It . is an honour for the regiment â it was just chance that we were the . unit on the spot when this came up, but it is very apt,'he said. 'This . is a very sad time for me and for a lot of people in the regiment â . when we had to go to war, she was there for us. Now we can be there for . her.' Margaret Thatcher stands proudly on Victory Green, Port Stanley, during her visit to mark the tenth anniversary of the Falklands War . The coffin will be drawn on gun carriage drawn by Kings Troop Royal Horse Artillery from St Clement Danes to St Paul's.

The landmark case could pave the way for up to 10 million Britons to sue Google for alleged privacy breaches. A group of 12 people, all of whom use Apple devices, including the popular iPhone, are seeking damages in a case thought to be the first of its kind in the UK.

Cookies are used by advertisers, and owners of other websites, to target advertising based on an individual's internet use. A High Court judge last year compared Google to a graffiti strewn wall, when ruling that the company cannot be held responsible for libellous or offensive content. It followed a long running defamation suit by a former Conservative . Party hopeful, Payam Tamiz, in reaction to piece on Google's Blogger.com platform labelling him a drug dealer and a thief. But Google was less successful at the High Court when its Motorola patents covering technology to synchronise messages across several devices was rule invalid. If the patent had been upheld, the Live Messenger instant messaging and email services of fellow industry heavyweight Microsoft would have been in violation. It has also faced anger after it was revealed that it only paid Â£6 million in tax in the UK last year despite making Â£2.5 billion.

'We hope that they will take this . opportunity to give Safari users a proper explanation about what . happened, to apologise and, where appropriate, compensate the victims of . their intrusion.' Judith Vidal-Hall, former editor of . magazine Index on Censorship, has issued proceedings against Google . after claiming they had covertly tracked her use of the internet.

But she laughed off the incident later, declaring: 'The child who threw it must have thought I was hungry.' Scroll down for video . Target: Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard had a school sandwich thrown at her for the second time this month . Earlier this month a Vegemite sandwich was tossed at - and missed - the Prime Minister when she was visiting a school in Queensland. The contents of the sandwich thrown today has sparked widespread debate on social media, with some observers asking why the parents of the culprit - who has yet to be identified - had prepared such a non-nutritious sandwich. But others said more expense had gone into the making of the sandwich as salami would have cost more than a spread of vegemite. Miss Gillard's security team and photographers surrounded the missile as it lay splattered at the Prime Minister's feet during her visit to Lyneham High School. She was walking through the foyer, filled with excited schoolchildren who were calling her name and trying to shake her hand, when the sandwich was lobbed from the back of the group and, said witnesses, struck her on the arm. She did not react at the time but joked later with the remark about the child who threw it probably thinking she was hungry. The salami sandwich attack happened weeks after another flying sandwich narrowly missed Julia Gillard .

The Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory, Katy Gallagher, also made light of the incident, saying that 'schools are full of kids and kids occasionally do silly things.' She added: 'Occasionally you're going to get a rogue student. 'From what I saw, and I was squashed in the crowd, it was a really excited student population eager to talk with the Prime Minister and she was very generous with her time.' While the school declined to comment pending an investigation, principal Colleen Matheson gave one student a severe dressing down, although the matter was apparently unrelated to the sandwich throwing. Miss Matheson was heard telling the student: 'I've already been humiliated by one child today - don't let it happen with another.'","Salami sandwich on white bread struck Miss Gillard on the arm .

Tragedy: Kayla Ferrante, 17, (pictured with her mother) was shot in the back as her boyfriend drove her home from a graduation party. The teen was killed a day after graduating a year early . Determined to finish high school a year early to begin a career with special needs children, Kayla graduated from Memorial High School last Friday. She was looking forward to a college class over the summer and had volunteer work lined up at a charity for special needs children and their families. Following her graduation ceremony, friends and family gathered at her grandmother's house to celebrate at a party hosted by her parents. She then went to a friend's house but texted her mother that evening, thanking her for the graduation party and telling her that she loved her. Questions: Police have no leads into the shooting and do not know if the couple were targeted . Loved: The star student, pictured right in her graduation gown with her boyfriend, was looking forward to summer college classes and volunteer work with children with special needs . Hit: Kayla's boyfriend was driving her home to make her midnight curfew. They were just yards from her driveway when six shots were fired, with one hitting the car and Kayla . Later that night, her boyfriend was driving her home and was just a few yards from her driveway when six shots rang out at about 11.50 p.m. One bullet from the high-powered rifle went through the car's license plate, through the seat, out of Kayla's chest and through the window as she sat in the car. Her mother heard the shots from inside the house. 'I ran to her,' Roxanne Thornton told NewsOn6. 'She was slumped in the seat. I could see her bleeding. I put my hand over her to stop the bleeding. 'I begged her to stay with me. I told her I loved her. She mumbled something and rolled her eyes but wouldn't open them. She was still breathing; her heart was still pumping blood out of her.' Distraught: Kayla's mother Roxanne Thornton heard the bullets and rushed outside to hold her daughter . Family: Kayla also leaves behind her father and younger brother, pictured at her graduation . Loss: Police have no leads but are investigating whether it was a case of mistaken identity . But Kayla died in surgery, leaving behind a devastated family, including a young brother. Her . mother went on: 'I held her as she was dying in that car. I can't ever . hold her again. I have to know why. There has to be an answer.'

Scene: Emergency services rushed to the car, centre, just before midnight but Kayla died in surgery . 'We cannot understand who would do . this or why and desperately want anyone with information to do the right . thing and come forward,' Roxanne and her husband Paul Ferrante said in a . statement.

Googleâs refusal to block grotesque child abuse websites is matched by the refusal of ministers to intervene. But why is the Government so strangely reluctant to tackle the internet search company? Google barely pays any tax and merrily snoops on Britons with its notorious Street View cars, so it is not as if ministers lack any provocation. Close: There appears to be a number of links between internet giant Google and the Conservative government . Google has been allowed to carve itself a reputation as a big friendly giant of the corporate world, brimming with ethical compassion and coolness. Gradually, the corporationâs ruthless streak is being exposed, but actually confronting the internet mammoth seems to be the last thing on the minds of ministers. By stunning coincidence, the cosy links between Google and the upper echelons of the Conservative Party could scarcely be more entangled. On a beautiful summerâs day at a society wedding in Oxfordshire last year, the nexus was all too clearly illustrated. David Cameron, accompanied by his wife Samantha and their daughter Florence, was among the congregation clapping enthusiastically outside a pretty Cotswold church. Working relationship: Both Prime Minister David Cameron, left, and Chancellor George Osborne, right, have held meetings with Google executives . The bride was Naomi Gummer, 29, a senior Google executive with the brief of âpublic policyâ. She was previously a political adviser to Jeremy Hunt when he was Culture Secretary in charge of internet regulation â so he was in attendance too, resplendent in his morning suit. The wedding guests quaffed champagne in the sunshine and congratulated proud father-of- the-bride Lord Chadlington, 70, who happens to be the president of Mr Cameronâs local constituency association. He is also a PR adviser to the Conservative Party. But Miss Gummer is far from the most senior Google executive to bask in the collective adulation of the British Government. Former employee: Rachel Whetstone, Google's top global spinner, was a Number 10 aide and was director of communications for Conservative leader Michael Howard. The pair are pictured together . Rachel Whetstone, Googleâs top global spinner, is a former Noâ10 aide and was Michael Howardâs director of communications when he was Tory leader. She is married to Steve Hilton, the T-shirt-wearing guru who is Mr Cameronâs close friend and former director of strategy at Noâ10. The power couple are regarded as key members of the Notting Hill set of Conservatives who propelled Mr Cameron to Downing Street, and at one stage Miss Whetstone was known as their queen. Meanwhile the Prime Minister is godfather to Miss Whetstoneâs younger son, and Mr Hilton was godfather to Ivan Cameron, the late eldest child of David and Samantha. The links do not end there, for Google has been assiduous at forging close ties at every level of Government. It is not just a case of former government policy wonks exiting through Westminsterâs ârevolving doorâ to Google â it works the other way too. Amy Fisher was once Googleâs PR chief for European affairs, but now she has bagged a job advising Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. And nor is it just Conservative politicians to whom Google offers the bosom of friendship. Sarah Hunter, the internet giantâs head of public policy in the UK, is a former media adviser to Tony Blair. And a lobbying veteran named D.âJ. Collins â a close friend of David Miliband and well-connected in New Labour circles â has in recent years been Googleâs European director of communications. Google spends a fortune on political lobbying, and politicians from all parties lap up the Google brand, delighted to be associated with its hip image.

The symbiotic relationship was on show again last year when the Chancellor agreed to open Google Campus, a hi-tech centre in East London for start-up technology firms. With Googleâs chairman, Eric Schmidt, a trusted member of Mr Cameronâs council of business advisers, critics wonder if there is any chance the PM will take steps to rein in the internet giant.","Both David Cameron and George Osborne have met with Google executives .

She said: 'It takes time, patience and an energetic, eager rabbit to take part in rabbit jumping. 'Rabbits are a massive responsibility and can cost up to Â£1,000 a year each - even without including their accommodation costs - and rabbits should have company so the cost is even more; they are not creatures that should be bought on a whim.

But he will have to remain on the Greek island until he can post bail, which must be done within 10 days. He will also have to return to Greece at a later date for a retrial at an appeals court.

Out in the open: The man suspected of carrying out the attack is seen walking along with a shopping bag through the giant La Defense underground railway complex . Oblivious: The man shows no sign of being aware that he is being filmed by surveillance cameras . The attack left Cedric Cordiez, a 23-year-old soldier, with wounds to the throat and neck after a man plunged a sharp instrument into him.

Women who are overweight and smoke are more likely to suffer menopausal night sweats, according to Australian research. The study found that women who are overweight, smoke and consume high levels of alcohol are at an increased risk of unpleasant menopause symptoms, but for the first time they were able to link specific lifestyle factors to different menopausal symptoms. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 52, although women can experience the menopause in their 30s or 40s. Feeling flushed: The menopause cause make day-to-day life very difficult . Common symptoms include hot flushes, night sweats, loss of libido, mood changes and insomnia. A hot flush is a sudden feeling of heat in the upper body, which can start in the face, or chest before spreading. The face, neck and chest may start to sweat and become red and patchy. There can also be a change in heart rate. It may become very rapid,Â  irregular or stronger than usual. Night sweats are hot flushes that occur at night and only last a few minutes. They are most common in the first year after your final period. The University of Queenslandâs School of Population Health analysed more than 10,000 Australian women aged between 45 and 50, and investigated their social, lifestyleÂ  and reproductive history. They found that well-educated women were less likely to suffer with either night sweats or hot flushes. However those who had gained weight, drank and smoked heavily or suffered with long-term reproductive problems did tend to suffer with the menopausal symptoms. The study found that smoking increased the likelihood of night sweats . Dr Gerrie-Cor Herber-Gast, who led the study said: âOne of the study's most interesting findings is women who were smokers or had diabetes were more likely to have night sweats, but were not at increased risk of hot flushes.â Dr Herber-Gast added that while it is not fully understood why certain factors may influence specific symptoms, the study paved the way for more research into how smoking and being overweight made women more vulnerable to night sweats. âFurther study is needed, but [increased incidence of night sweats] may be explained by a number of reasons, including differing perceptions of the intensity of night sweating by smokers and women with diabetes. âWomen with diabetes may experience increased night sweats because of the low glucose levels during the night.â Previous studies have shown that certain lifestyle factors that put women at a higher risk of menopausal symptoms in general, but very little research has been carried out on how specific lifestyle choices affect the likelihood of each symptom separately. âDetermining the risk factors for these symptoms separately may help clarify their causes, help us identify who is at high risk of developing them and allow for early intervention to avoid or treat them.â","Leading an unhealthy lifestyle puts women at higher risk of developing unpleasant menopausal symptoms .

Cash bribes to hospitals to put patients on to the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway will be ended, families have been told. The disclosure means that the NHS payments â which amount to at least Â£30million â are likely to be stopped later this year. A Health Department inquiry is underway into the Pathway, which was originally developed to ease the last days and hours of dying patients. Progress: Fiona Bruce MP, left, saved her father from the pathway which Care Minister Norman Lamb, right, said he acknowledged 'terrified' some people . Care Minister Norman Lamb spoke to families of Pathway patients in Leeds in the first of a series of meetings designed to feed their views into the inquiry, which was launched in February and will report in the summer. One family at the meeting said that their 82-year old grandmother died over a period of 12 days after fluids and food were withdrawn.Â  They said that their grandmother, who had early stage cervical cancer, was eating and drinking before being put on the Pathway. How the Mail has reported on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway . One family member said that Mr Lamb acknowledged that people were âterrifiedâ of the Liverpool Care Pathway. She . added: âHe is appalled that people feared they were not getting cared . for but put to death in hospital. He said he would definitely be looking . to stop any form of financial payment to hospitals to put patients on . the Liverpool Care Pathway. âHe said that most definitely he didnât believe that hospitals should be gaining from patients dying on the LCP.â Payments to hospitals to hit targets were first revealed by the Daily Mail last autumn. Some have been paid hundreds of thousands of pounds a year for reaching targets for LCP deaths. For . example, the hospital trust in Blackpool was last year paid Â£450,000 in . return for ensuring 35 per cent of patients who die in hospital are on . the LCP. Families have protested that relatives who were not dying have . been placed on the Pathway. Tory MP Fiona Bruce has told how she saved her fatherâs life when she pulled him off the Pathway. She . had already seen her mother die an âagonisingâ death when she was put . on an end-of-life pathway after brain surgery two years earlier. Miss Bruce said her 83-year-old father . was admitted to a hospital, which she did not name, suffering from an . unidentified illness that left him âweak and frailâ. After . a few days, a nurse had âalmost casuallyâ told her: âHe has not long to . live. We are putting him on the Liverpool Care Pathway.â Miss Bruce told a meeting in Parliament there had been ânoÂ  discussion, no explanation, no consultationâ between the family and the hospital staff. She said that her motherâs âheart-rendingâ death after being deprived of food and fluids â without her family being consulted â had left her with a sense of âterrible guiltâ. The Congleton MP contacted her sister and they insisted their father was removed from the Pathway. He was placed in a nursing home. âNow, well over six months later that elderly man is very much alive, eating well, getting up when he wants and resting when he doesnât, enjoying visits from his family,â she said. âHe is looking forward to his 85th birthday.â An end to payments for Pathway targets would free hospitals from the suspicion of taking money in return for the deaths of patients. Analysts believe the inquiry will also recommend that no patient should be put on the Pathway without either their own consent or that of their closest family. Another likelihood is a change of name so the tainted title of Liverpool Care Pathway is no longer used. Mr Lamb said: âIt is important that I respect the independence of this review but I have already made clear that I have serious concerns about the use of financial incentives and that they should only ever be used if they demonstrably improve patient care.â","NHS payments to put patients on Liverpool Care Pathway to be stopped .

Lifespans are increasing so rapidly that a boy born in 28 daysâ time will â on average â live a week longer than a boy born today. Life expectancy for women, meanwhile, is rising at the rate of four hours a day, according to analysts at the Office for National Statistics. Healthy: Life expectancy for men is growing at a rate of six hours per day, but for women it is four hours . Boys born in England and Wales in 2011 are likely to live for an average of 78.7 years, nearly eight years more than a male child born at the beginning of the 1980s. Women continue to live longer than men. A newborn girl in 2011 can expect to reach the age of 82.6 yearsÂ  â six years more than their counterparts from the 1980s. The unprecedented changes have multiplied the numbers of older people in the population and seen men close the lifespan advantage enjoyed by women. Medical advances and the transformation of the economy have led to people eating more healthily and living in better heated and more comfortable homes. Men are also more likely to work in safe and air-conditioned offices than in polluted industrial plants. The ONS report said: âOne major factor is the improvements in mortality from circulator diseases, such as heart disease and stroke, partly driven by changing smoking habits and medical and technological advances. Life expectancy: A baby born in 2011 will live nearly eight years longer than a male born in 1980 . âPeople who are younger than 60 have also benefited from a lifetime of NHS health care.â The report gave estimates of life expectancy covering the years between 2009 and 2011. It said the gap between life expectancy at birth for boys and girls had narrowed from six years in 1980/82 to the four years estimated in the latest count. Over the past 30 years, it said, life expectancy at birth has gone up by six hours a day for boys and four hours a day for girls. Nine out of ten boys can now expect to live to reach the age of 65 â a retirement point now being raised because of rising life expectancy. Fewer than three quarters of those born in the early 1980s could expect to reach retirement age. âLife expectancy at birth in England and Wales has reached its highest level on record for both males and females,â the report said. Life expectancy has been rising since the industrial revolution transformed the living standards of most. By 1901, men could expect to reach the age of 45 and women 49. Two world wars and the economic slump between them dragged down lifespans only temporarily and life expectancy has been rising smoothly since the early 1960s.","A boy born in 28 days will live a week longer than one born today .

Prince Charles used his feudal entitlements to Â£3.3million in unclaimed estates to support his own charities . Prince Charles has used his feudal entitlement to Â£3.3m of the unclaimed legacies of dead people to fund his own charities and support his old Scottish private school which he once described as âColditz with kiltsâ. His title as Duke of Cornwall means he becomes the owner of the assets of anyone living in the county of Cornwall who dies âintestateâ, meaning who dies without a will or known relations. Last year this entitlement provided him with more than Â£450,000 and he is sitting on Â£3.3m in cash from years of collecting Cornish legacies, according to latest accounts seen by the Guardian. In 2012 the benevolent fund he set up to use the money made its biggest grant of Â£20,000 to Charlesâs charity Business in the Community, whose supporters include some of the biggest companies in Britain. Another of its largest grants was of Â£5,000 to Gordonstoun, the Scottish public school, which Charles attended in 1962 and reportedly hated, and where a place now costs Â£30,000 a year. The money was provided to support bursaries for Cornish children who otherwise would not be able to afford the fees. A total of Â£1,000 went to his London-based Princeâs Foundation for Building Communities, which backs the princeâs controversial ideas about architecture and planning. His title as Duke of Cornwall means he becomes owner of assets of anyone in the county who dies intestate . Last year the foundation established a . five-year partnership with the Ideal Home Show to showcase the value of . sustainable design, which has been championed by Charles. The . foundation believes that sustainably planned, built and maintained . communities improve the quality of life of everyone whoâs part of them, . according to its chief executive Hank Dittmar, and âis empowering people . to want better places to live in and helping them to achieve itâ. Prince Charlesâ title already lands him an Â£18m private annual income. The donations provided by deceased people in Cornwall have drawn particular criticism in the county. Last night there were calls for the inheritances to be channelled into the public purse as they are in the rest of England. Burt . Biscoe, a councillor in Truro, told the Guardian Charles was âabusing . the loyaltyâ of Cornish people and the âprivilegeâ of receiving the . intestate assets. A grant of Â£5,000 was given to his old school Gordonstoun that he once called 'Colditz with kilts' A grant of Â£1,000 was given to his Prince's Foundation for Building Community, which backs his planning ideas . He said: âThink what he could achieve if he gave that Â£450,000 to Cornwall every year â¦ The area of giving should coincide with the area of taking.â Charles has also been criticised for only distributing Â£100,000 â less than a quarter of the assets received from the deceased last year. A Duchy of Cornwall spokesman said all of the money received would eventually be given to charity â minus the administration costs â but all the money from donations comes in at different points in the year and so is not allocated immediately. Graham Smith, director of Republic, the campaign for an elected head of state, added: âCharles is sitting on those funds when they could be supporting the vital work of charities, many of whom are really struggling at the moment.â The benevolent fund made 151 grants last year, including ones to the Soil Association, the organic farming movement which Charles supports and the Dorchester arts festival near his Poundbury housing development in Dorset. A spokesman added that the Soil Association, Business in the Community and the Princeâs Foundation for Building Communities all carry out work in the south west. A Duchy of Cornwall spokesman said: âThe Prince of Wales personally decided that the money from bona vacantia should be donated to charity. âAny charity can apply for a grant but the Fund favours charitable causes in the South West.â","Duke of Cornwall's title means he .

The mother of a Broadway actress who died after a late-night whiskey binge has slammed the bar that served her for not calling time on her drinking before she overdosed on alcohol. Shana Dowdeswell, 23 - who has acted onstage with Cynthia Nixon and . appears in the new Robert De Niro movie 'The Big Wedding' - died five days after downing several shots in a New York bar called The Basement last December. Now her mother, Laurie Smith, 60, has blamed the bar for it's part in her daughter's death, claiming she confronted staff about why they served her when she was clearly too drunk. But barstaff told her they had served the actress four shots of whiskey and that she was drinking water in the early morning of Dec. 7, the New York Post reported. She said The Basement was a regular haunt for Shana, adding: 'At first, I hated The Basement. That was a well-known gathering . place for people who wanted to drink a lot for a little bit of money. Thereâs just something going wrong down there.' Now she is calling for police to clamp down on pubs that serve alcohol to punters who have already drunk too much and wants to launch a campaign group to warn mothers about the perils of binge drinking. 'The same way thereâs Mothers Against Drunk Driving, there has to be a . Mothers Against Overdrinking. Wake up kids - it has grotesque . outcomes.' she warned. She said her daughter - who has acted on screen and stage since the age of eight - entered the bar at around midnight and began ordering whiskeys. She then stumbled home two and a half hours later but only got as far as her parents' doorstep where she passed out. A dog walker discovered the girl and she was rushed to Beth Israel Medical Center. She died five days later of acute and chronic alcoholism. Scroll down for video.

The girl, who was 5-foot-2 and weighted 115 lbs, registered a blood alcohol content of 0.39 at the time she was found, which is five times the state's legal limit for . driving. Basement manager Ronnie Mejia denied that Shana was served too much, telling the Post she never appeared drunk and 'never got more than three drinks'. The Medical Examinerâs Office ruled that Shana died of 'natural causes due to complications of acute and chronic alcoholism.' The girl's mother did tell DNA Info that her daughter began visiting neighborhood when she was just a teen. 'She probably had issues around alcohol that we weren't aware of,' she said.

A defendant called Bart Simpson, appearing in court in front of a judge called Mr Burns. However, this isn't a fictional case but a real-life trial which took place at Warwick Crown Court this week. Bizarre: A defendant called Bart Simpson, appearing in court in front of a judge called Mr Burns at Warwick Crown Court . Company Director Barton Simpson, 56,  stood trial in front of Mr Recorder Burns at Warwick Crown Court on Monday. He was spared jail after admitting that he carried a .38 Smith and Wesson revolver in his luggage while catching a flight at Birmingham airport in May last year. Mr Burns sentenced Simpson to a 12-month community order with 140 hours of unpaid work and ordered him to pay Â£800 costs. The defendant was flying to Croatia when he put his bag through an X-ray machine which detected the weapon. He told police the gun, which he inherited from his father, was a 'curio' and that he had forgotten it was in his holdall. Stars: Bart Simpson and Mr Burns are long-running characters in The Simpsons . Andrew Wilkins, prosecuting, said . Simpson normally kept the revolver at his home in Eccleshall, . Staffordshire and realised his mistake almost immediately. 'He put his hands to his face and hesitated before he then went through the personal metal detector,' the lawyer said. 'The reason he said he had it with . him, and there is no reason to disagree, was that he was having work . done on his flat while he was travelling and did not want it to come . into the hands of the decorator.' Mr Wilkins said Simpson had intended . to leave the gun locked in his car, but he was distracted because of . circumstances including the deaths of a friend and of his son, a serving . soldier. Mr Burns told Simpson: 'It was a very stupid thing you did. You must be punished for it, but I think you can be dealt with by way of a community order.' A court worker said: 'It's a bizarre . coincidence that Bart Simpson is actually on trial in front of Mr Burns . but it'll proceed as any other criminal case would. 'There were some eyebrows raised when the court list was published.' The fictional Bart Simpson is the main character in the popular, long-running animated television series The Simpsons. He is the eldest child and only son of Homer and Marge. Charles Montgomery 'Monty' Burns, often referred to as Mr Burns, is the evil owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.

An employee at a New York City law firm with a swanky address has named her boss in a suit that alleges he asked her to be âhis third wifeâ and sexually harassed her for weeks. Sabrina Rafi, 27, began as a paralegal at Ray and Associates in December and says she began to be harassed by the firmâs founder, James R. Ray, shortly thereafter. Filed April 11 in Manhattan Federal Court, Rafiâs suit goes into lurid detail about her bossâs alleged fascination with polygamy. Ray has not publicly commented on the case. Stunned: Sabrina Rafi, 27, filed suit against former boss James R. Ray, 50, alleging he 'urged her' to try polygamy and sexually harassed her for weeks . According to a New York Post report, the suit states that Ray first suggested Rafi try âthe polygamist lifestyle,â on January 7, early in her short time with his firm. Rafi also claims in the suit that Ray frequently bragged about being âmarried to multiple womenâ and about his many sexual partners. âHe was describing his sexual encounters with women. How he would say he met this woman at a club and she was from a Middle Eastern country,â Rafi told the Post. âHe said, âYouâre from a middle eastern background too.ââ The recent law school grad said she . was afraid to rebuff Rayâs advances because another female employee was fired . for doing that very thing and she feared having a similar fate. Besides, Rafi said, it seemed to begin as a joke. She told the Post, âAt the beginning, I laughed it off.â Polygamist? Rafi's suit claims Ray boasted of his multiple wives while she was his paralegal and once even forced her to feed him with chopsticks . However, Rafi claims things quickly became more serious and that she âgot pretty scared.â On January 15, Rafi says Ray demanded she dine with him at Korean Palace, a restaurant near their office. Afraid for her livelihood, Rafi says she complied and immediately regretted it. She says Ray insisted on talking about porn, calling it âkey to a successful relationship.â Rafi says Ray ignored her when she . told him she had a boyfriend and refused to eat unless she fed him with . chopsticks in front of other patrons, which she describes as . âhumiliating.â âIâm . picking up the chopsticks and my hands are shaking,â she said. âI think I . dropped the shrimp at one point. I picked it up again with the . chopsticks and then he opens his mouth and closes his eyes as if he was . in love with me.â At one point, according to court documents, Rafi ran from the restaurant as Ray pursued her. Misguided: Rafi claims Ray told her his myriad sexual encounters included a woman from a Middle Eastern country and said 'your from a Middle Eastern background, too.' Thereafter, Rafi says she began covering herself at the office by dressing in layers and even wearing coats indoors.

"By . Damien Gayle . UPDATED: . 08:18 EST, 11 August 2011 . Police took revenge on dozens of riot looters last night as they kicked in their front doors and hauled them into the street. Riot officers armed with battering rams descended on a string of properties as they looked for pay back over the chaos that swept the country. The officers collared one suspect at a home in Brixton after receiving a tip off that he had been involved in the disturbances. He is likely to be the first of hundreds more who are brought to justice as a huge public backlash grows against the troublemakers. How does it feel? A suspected looter is paraded through the street and bundled into a police van after his home in Brixton was raided last night . Brought to justice: The suspect is pulled from his front doors while officers rummage through his home in search of looted goods . The police action came as the rioters' reign of terror seemingly evaporated into the night. Just as the first bursts of violence . in Tottenham came from nowhere, so the trouble unexpectedly receded. Contributory factors may have included the fact that police forces . throughout the nation were braced for action with as many blue uniformed . bodies as they could put on the street; 16,000 in London alone. Perhaps . the three deaths in Birmingham yesterday prompted a rethink by some. And with the arrest . figures in London alone up to 888 perhaps there were just too few . rioters and looters to cause the same level of disturbance. But . with no serious incidents overnight, simply a procession of charged . rioters trudging through overnight court sittings, the lull in violence . begs the question: Is the worst over? Upmarket: Police officers prepare to carry out a raid on a property on the Churchill Gardens estate in Pimlico, London last night . He means business: A riot office with steely stare carrying a battering ram strides down the street, and right, bashing down a suspect's front door . On Wednesday youths had rampaged through Manchester's . city centre, turning it into a war zone, and boasted that the government had . lost control of the cities. They pledged to continue as long as they . could. And even if they do get caught, they . are not afraid of the consequences, with one telling BBC Radio 4's Today . programme: 'What are they gonna do? Give me an Asbo? I'll live with . that.' London remained relatively calm on Tuesday evening thanks to a mammoth police presence, but looting and thuggery . continued in Birmingham and Liverpool, and broke out for the first time . in Manchester, Nottingham and Gloucester. Regional . forces, seemingly caught on the back foot after donating hundreds of . riot officers to help the Met regain control of the capital, struggled . to contain hundreds of yobs who took to the high streets to loot. Police, open up: Officers rush through the doorway of the flat in Pimlico where looted goods were suspected of being held . Gotcha: The suspect us lead away in handcuffs followed closely behind by another suspected looter from the riots in London on Monday evening . But the Met . pledged that policing numbers would remain at an unprecedented high for . the second night in a row, leaving forces elsewhere without crack teams . trained for public disorder as they saw 16,000 police on the streets. Scotland Yard today said that 888 . people had now been arrested in connection with violence, disorder and . looting in the capital, with 371 charged. On Wednesday a police source told Mail . Online that while there were no early reports of trouble in the capital, . there will remain a 'higher . more visible police presence on the streets'. 'The . policing will be widespread across the capital,' he added, 'and as we . have done on previous nights we will be concentrating on areas where we . have the most concerns.' Bounty: Police officers show off goods recovered from the raid, including a pair of Nike shoes and Hugo Boss clothing including jeans, shirts and a coat . Police carry suspected stolen goods - including Hugo Boss shirts (right) from the building . Haul: A Hugo Boss bag costing Â£285 is recovered by police on Churchill Gardens estate in Pimlico . In . Manchester, where rioters rampaged through the central . shopping district, burning and looting shops and fighting running . battles with police, police said they were making no special . preparations. Greater . Manchester Police said that they were not expecting a second night of . violence in the city, but did concede that there would be more police on . standby than were available to commanders last night. A source said: 'There's not a lot . happening. It's raining here at the moment and we're doing our rain . dance and hoping they [the rioters] will keep away. 'We have certainly got more officers . tonight than last night, but whether they are out or not is another . matter because there's nothing happening.' Enforcers: Police prepare to raid a home in Brixton as the round-up of riot suspects continued . However, . rioters quoted by BBC Radio showed a terrifying sense of impunity about . their role in the violent clashes that gripped the heart of the city . last night. 'Why are you going to miss the opportunity to get free stuff,' one asked a reporter during the unrest last night. 'The government are not in control because if they were we wouldn't be able to do it would we?' The young looters told the Today . programme that they were unconcerned about being caught and did not . expect that they would have to suffer as a result of their crimes. Tough: Riot police hold a man to the ground after he was found drunk outside a pub on Eltham High Street in London, last night . Standing watch: A line of police officers stand on Eltham High Street in London last night as riots across the capital died down . Surrounded: Riot police make a circle around a group of local people who has gathered outside a church in Eltham last night . 'This will be my first offence,' continued the young miscreant. 'I've not been in trouble before so I'm not really bothered. 'I'll get a caution. The prisons are full.' The Metropolitan Police's Deputy . Assistant Commissioner, Stephen Kavanagh, said some of his officers were . disappointed with the sentences handed out so far to looters. He . told BBC Breakfast: 'That has been personally raised by me and others, . and the commissioner I know has also raised it, so we will move through . those issues and I am confident we will get the support of the courts.' Lockdown: Riot police frisk people on a street in Croydon, south London . Courts flooded: At the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court in London rioters were charged through the night, in scenes that were repeated across the country . He said the huge policing presence on the streets would continue for another night, and would then be reviewed. He added that more than 100 arrest warrants were being executed this morning. Elsewhere in the country, police were confident they would be able to keep control of the streets. West Midlands Police, responsible for . maintaining order in three areas where lawlessless broke out last night . promised that there were enough officers to protect communities. In Birmingham, three men out on the . streets to protect their community were tragically killed after a rioter . hit them with a car, while in West Bromwich and Wolverhampton youths . ran amok. In a statement . published on the force's website, Chief Constable Chris Sims promised . that 600 specially trained riot officers would be deployed across the . region. Pitched battles: Mounted police outside the Arndale Centre in Manchester's main shopping district last night. The city was gripped by violence as youths looted and pillaged shops . All leave for West Midlands officers . has been cancelled and the force has, where possible, suspended other . operations, Mr Sims said. Nottinghamshire . Police is also deploying more officers tonight after Nottingham was . rocked by civil disorder that saw a mob firebomb a police station. A . spokesman for the force told MailOnline that they had not sent any . officers to help with the policing effort in London and that they had . been given operational support by South Yorkshire police. She . said that the force were 'more than prepared' for any outbreaks of . violence but added that intelligence indicated the city would be quieter . tonight. In Gloucester, a dispersal order . covering areas where violence broke out will come into from tomorrow and . last until February 11, 2012. The . order is being introduced in response to an increase in groups behaving . in an anti-social way and intimidating local residents and shoppers. 'The . order allows police or Police Community Support Officers to direct any . groups of two or more to leave the area for 24 hours when they believe . the behaviour of the group is likely to result in members of the public . being harassed, alarmed or distressed,' a force spokesman said. 'Dispersal . orders provide us with an effective tool which we can use at our . discretion to ensure that those who intimidate others can be ordered to . leave an area and receive a strong punishment if they ignore the order.' Earlier today, the police were given the green light to use water cannons with 24 hours' notice. David . Cameron, the Prime Minister, said that plans had been put in place to . deal with the disorder using water cannons - making it the first time . they would be used on the streets of mainland Britain.

A 17th century Grade II listed mansion that inspired DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover has gone on the market for Â£1million. The stunning Teversal Manor, near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, was put on sale by owners Janet and John Marples after they spend more than a decade restoring it. In DH Lawrence's 1928 tale, Constance Chatterley creeps from Wragby Hall, the home she shares with her paralysed husband Clifford, at night to conduct an affair with gamekeeper Oliver Mellors. The country house widely thought to have been the inspiration behind Wragby Hall in DH Lawrence's notorious novel, Lady Chatterley's Lover, is up for sale - for Â£1million . Properly known as Teversal Manor, the six-bedroom house is said to be the inspiration for Wragby Hall in Lady Chatterley's Lover and is referenced many times in the 1928 novel . Fans of DH Lawrence can buy a slice of literary history for the princely sum of Â£1million . The kitchen: During the First World War the house was used for the rehabilitation of soldiers . The book achieved infamy for its story of a physical relationship between a working-class man and an upper-class woman, its graphic descriptions of sex, and its use of words considered shocking at the time. It caused a storm upon its release, and the original could not be published in Britain until 1960. Lawrence, who was born in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, is believed to have been inspired by the six-bedroom Teversal Manor while walking around the area of his childhood. It is located in Teversal old village, known as 'Tevershall' in Lawrence's book. DH Lawrence's book caused a storm upon its release, and an unexpurgated version could not be published in Britain until 1960 . Mrs Marples and her husband, 72-year-old John, have lived in the manor for 19 years and have lovingly restored much of the property . In the book, Wragby Hall is where Constance Chatterley lives with her paralysed husband Clifford and it's from which she creeps at night to visit her working class lover . Mrs Marples, 69, said: 'During the First World War, the house was used for the rehabilitation of soldiers. 'They put a slope down to the second garden terrace for wheelchairs and it's said Lawrence got the idea for Constance's husband Clifford from that, as he was in a wheelchair.'

But when the full unexpurgated . edition was published by Penguin Books in Britain in 1960, the publisher . was taken to court under the Obscene Publications Act 1959. The trial became a major public event and a test of the new obscenity law. The new Act had allowed publishers to escape conviction if they could show that a work was of literary merit. So Penguin printed off 200,000 copies and challenged the Director of Public Prosecutions to take the company to court. But when it did, the jury decided in favour of Penguin and within a year it had sold two million copies.

With a torch and time-lapse photography, the whole world becomes a canvas for artists who create âmagicâ light paintings. Russian artists Dmitry Alekseevich Makarov, 29, and Catherine Larina, 28 are following in the footsteps of Pablo Picasso who experimented with light painting with stunning effect in 1949. Makarov and Larina from Moscow spend hours creating their works, painting with light to create illuminated animals and human figures. 'Magic' light: Russian artists Dmitry Alekseevich Makarov and Catherine Larina have followed in Pablo Picasso's footsteps, using a light technique to create paintings using a hand-held light source . Makarov said: âPainting with light is amazing because the light is alive. âItâs like magic. The images drawn by the light reveal to us our vision for the arts, and the light painter has the whole world as their canvas.â To create a light painting a camera is set up on a tripod with the shutter open for a timed exposure while a hand-held light source, such as a torch, is moved in the air in a pattern. The camera captures the outline. Takes time: Creating these light paintings can take several weeks to perfect . Huge canvas: Artist Makarov says that 'a light painter has the whole world as their canvas' Picasso created some stunning photographs when he offered to paint with light in five sessions with lighting innovator Gjon Mili in 1949. In a series known as his 'light drawings', the images show the artist waving a strobe light to create figures reminiscent of the screaming cattle in Guernica or the curvaceous woman in The Dreamer. Mili, a photographer for LIFE magazine, visited Picasso in the south of France, and showed him images he had created by fixing lights on the shoes of ice skaters as they jumped through the dark. The artist was instantly taken and began tracing shapes through the air with his finger, hinting at the light doodles to come. Picasso's 'light drawings': The famous artist experimented with the technique in 1949. Pictured is Picasso waving a strobe light to create a light painting . Bright idea: Lighting innovator Gjon Mili visited Picasso in the south of France and together they created 30 images including this one as Picasso 'draws' a centaur with light . 'Picasso gave Mili 15 minutes to try one experiment,' LIFE wrote in its January 30, 1950, issue, in which the images were first published. 'He was so fascinated by the results that he posed for five sessions.' Picasso held a small electric light and moved it through a darkened room. Two cameras were used - one to give a side view and another for a front view. Many of the 30 images the two men created were put on display in early 1950 at New York's Museum of Modern Art. Strong urge to create: Makarov loves this art form because he often feels a strong, irresistible urge to create an image which he describes as a 'flight of feelings' How to: To create a light painting, the camera is set up on a tripod with the shutter opened for a timed exposure while a torch is moved in the air.

A conman who made thousands of pounds by claiming he was collecting unwanted clothes for Barnardo's childrens' charity has been jailed for 13 months. Lithuanian Darius Kaminskas, 25, made fake bags copying the charity's own - but misspelled the name as 'Bernhardos'. He left them on hundreds of doorsteps and sent the donated clothes back to his home country, where they were sold on the thriving secondhand market. Kaminskas, who also posed as a collector for a breast cancer charity, made an estimated Â£35,000 in just nine months - cheating real charities out of vital funding. He was caught when trading standards officials received numerous complaints from suspicious householders in Dorset, Wiltshire and the West Midlands. His bogus bags misspelled Barnardo's as 'Bernhardos' and when quizzed Kaminskas claimed that was the name of a Lithuanian church. Kaminskas, who operated the con through his 'Sparko Ltd' company, admitted fraudulent trading and was jailed for 13 months. Bristol Crown Court heard that the con artist from Horfield, Bristol, got the idea for his scheme after working for legitimate charity collectors. He set up his company in April 2010 and recruited three accomplices to distribute the bags across a wide area. His 'Bernhardos' bags used the same green bag as the charity's genuine collection bag and had phrases similar to those used by Barnardo's. Rumbled: Kaminskas claimed to be making the collections on behalf of children's charity Barnardo's but misspelled the name as 'Bernhardos' on his fake charity bags . He also made bags bearing a pink ribbon commonly associated with breast cancer charities. The particular version Kaminskas delivered used the trademark of a Lithuanian charity tackling breast cancer by the name of Azzara. Both fake bags falsely claimed to generate charity income of Â£50 for every tonne of clothing collected. But Alan Fuller, prosecuting for Bristol City Council, said Kaminskas sold the clothing to wholesalers in Lithuania where he got around 50p per kilo. When his company base was raided investigators found thousands of the fake charity bags. They also seized a laptop containing scanned images of at least 38 different charity bags. Deception: The 25-year-old also posed as a donations' collector for a breast cancer charity by manufacturing bags with the pink ribbon symbol associated with the cause . When quizzed Kaminskas claimed he was collecting on behalf of a church in Lithuania which translated as 'Bernhardos' - but that turned out to be a lie. Defending, Rupert Lowe claimed that Kaminskas, who has a partner and a two month-old child, was a hard worker. He said: 'He could see money being made and thought ""I could do it for myself"".' Jailing Kaminskas, Judge Julian Lambert told him: 'You were callous and cynical. 'Scam is the right word in English for what you did. Public confidence is greatly dented by what you did.' 'Callous and cynical': Kaminskas, from Horfield, Bristol, cheated real charities out of an estimated Â£35,000 over the course of nine months with the scam . Kaminskas was also disqualified from being a company director for seven years. After the case Bristol City Council spokesman Stephen Meale said: 'The collection of donated goods, especially clothing, is a very significant income stream for many charities. 'The cynical and fraudulent use of bags falsely claiming to be collecting on behalf of charities is not only abusing people's good will and depriving charities of income intended for them to carry out their work but will erode people's confidence in this significant means of fundraising.' The Association of Charity Shops says bogus collectors deprive genuine good causes of millions of pounds every year. The City of London police estimate that charity bag theft and fraud costs charities Â£50 million per annum. Ringing alarm bells: Kaminskas was caught out when residents who had received the bags became suspicious about the authenticity of the collection bags .","Darius Kaminskas, 25, delivered the bags to homes in Dorset and Wiltshire .

The former flame of the suspected Boston Marathon bombing suspect says that she was so attracted to him when she saw him outside that she immediately went over and flirted. 'I met him standing outside a building and honestly, his face was enough to capture my heart. I walked right up to him and I was like, 'Oh my God, you are adorable. Can we hang out?' I'm very forward,' the girl told Mother Jones. The girl, who is a fellow UMASS-Dartmouth student that is not releasing her name, started a romantic relationship with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev last fall that only lasted about two weeks. Friends in low places: Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov (left and center) were identified as the two friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) who have been held in Boston jail since April 20 . The American: Robel Phillipos, who was identified as this student by CNN, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with making false statements to police and obstructing justice in a terrorism investigation . During that time, she also met his three friends who were arrested on Wednesday for destroying evidence and lying to federal investigators. The girl said that they all looked up to Tsarnaev, whom they referred to as 'Jahar'. 'They all sort of idolized Jahar,' she said. Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, both Kazakh nationals, were charged with conspiring to obstruct justice by destroying evidence. An American named Robel Phillipos is charged with knowingly and willfully making false statements to investigators. She said that she met the three other young men through Tsarnaev, though she described him as being the 'leader of his group'. She said that she was shocked by Tsarnaev's involvement in the bombing, as well as any help that he received from his friends. 'There was no indication that they were crazy at all. They just seemed goofy, kind of lackadaisical, not interested in their studies. But, you know, whatever, it was their first semester of college. No one really cared about books,' she said. Tsarnaev and the unidentified young woman spent their time together involved listening to music and smoking pot, though she says she ended things when he wanted to move faster than she did though she doesn't consider that as an indication that he was bound to be a killer. College friends: The first reports claim that the three people in custody all went to college with Dzhokhar at UMass Dartmouth and were thought to have helped him cover up for the bombings after the fact . 'I don't think that's necessarily being a terrorist. I think that's just called being a hands-y teenaged boy,' she said. She told Mother Jones that she was surprised by implications that the bombing had anything to do with Tsarnaev's religious beliefs as he never mentioned his religion during their time together. She said that Dias Kadyrbayev, who seemed the closest to Tsarnaev, was more conservative as he once made a comment to her at a party about her dress being too revealing. After Tsarnaev, Kadyrbayev appears to be the most in-command of the group as he was the one who texted . Kadyrbayev warned his friend that that he was plastered across television news outlets . 'Tsarnaevâs return texts contained âlolâ and other things Kadyrbayev interpreted as jokes,' documents say. On the same day that the FBI released pictures and video clips of the Tsarnaev brothers at the bomb scene, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov removed items from the younger bomber's dorm room. That was just two days before the FBI searched the room. The criminal complaint lists that they removed Dzhokhar's backpack from his room and 'agreed to get rid of it after concluding from news reports that Tsarnaev was one of the Boston Marathon bombers.' The three friends- Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov and Phillipos- went over to Tsarnaev's on-campus dormitory after seeing the news reports. Close: Azamat Tazhayakov, seen here with bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in an undated picture, told police that about a month before the Marathon attack, Dzhokhar said that he knew how to make a bomb . Texts: When the group arrived at the dorm, Dias . Kadyrbayev (left) showed Tazhayakov (right) a text from the bomber that . said 'I'm about to leave if you need something in my room take it' Happier times: Kadyrbayev told investigators that he suggested they take Tsarnaev's backpack and his laptop from the room, and later was the one to throw it in the garbage at his off-campus apartment . When the group arrived at the dorm, Kadyrbayev showed Tazhayakov a text from the bomber that said 'I'm about to leave if you need something in my room take it.' He did not specify where he was going, but Tazhayakov told investigators that he felt that this meant he would never see Tsarnaev alive again. Kadyrbayev 'knew when he saw the empty fireworks that Tsarnaev was involved in the Marathon bombing. Tazhayakov was more alarmed because the tubes had been emptied but not destroyed, meaning that Tsarnaev could have either used the explosives or planned to use them. Kadyrbayev found Vaseline in the room, which he told the others Tsarnaev used to make bombs. First suspects: Brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were identified as the first suspects . Alarm bells: The friends said that they became concerned that Tsarnaev actually had something to do with the bombings when they found these empty firework containers in his dorm room . At one point in the police interviews, Tazhayakev said that during a meal a month before the attack, Tsarnaev told he and Kadyrbayev that he knew how to make a bomb. Kadyrbayev was reportedly the one who 'decided to remove the backpack from the room in order to help his friend Tsarnaev avoid trouble.' In a slightly unexpected explanation, Kadyrbayev says that he took Dzhokhar's laptop because he did not want to the roommate to think that he was 'stealing or behaving suspiciously by just taking the backpack'.","Fellow UMASS-Dartmouth student talks about how she struck up a brief romance with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev last fall .

The United States and South Korean took part in their first large river-crossing drill in a decade today. The exercise comes ten days after the South accused its neighbour North Korea of firing three short-range guided missiles into its eastern waters. More than 300 U.S. soldiers from 2nd infantry division and 95 South Korean 6th Engineer Brigade soldiers built floating rafts to transport 14 tanks and 16 armored vehicles across the Imjin River in Yeoncheon. Scroll down for video . The U.S. and South Korea embarked on their first joint river-crossing exercise for 10 years today in the wake of increasing threats from North Korea . 95 South Korean soldiers from 6th Engineer Brigade took part in the crossing of the Imjin River today . More than 300 soldiers from the 30,000 American troops stationed in South Korea practised the drill with tanks and armored vehicles . North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, is said to have fired three missiles at South Korean waters earlier this month . The United States has about 30,000 troops in South Korea to support the country's 650,000-strong armed forces. North Korea has about 1.2million troops, mostly stationed along the border. The exercise involved the U.S. Army's M1A2 tank and soldiers from 2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team of 2nd infantry division. Ten days ago, South Korea's Defence Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said the North fired three missiles at the South's eastern waters, though its intent was unclear. In March, North Korea tested two short-range missiles off its east coast. U.S. officials said North Korea recently withdrew two mid-range missiles believed to be capable of reaching Guam after moving them to the east coast earlier this year. Meanwhile, North Korea is still trying to import and export nuclear and ballistic missile-related items but financial and trade sanctions are slowing progress on development of their prohibited weapons, according to a recent UN report. South Korean soldiers seen during the exercise, which follow an accusation by the South that the North had launched three missiles earlier this month . This joint exercise was the first of its kind for a decade . Troops from 2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team of 2nd infantry division and South Korean soldiers from 6th Engineer Brigade were on the river . Key parts of the report provide further information on North Korea's attempts to evade four rounds of increasingly tough UN sanctions aimed at reining in its development of nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles to deliver them. While sanctions have not halted these programmes, the panel said, 'it has in all likelihood considerably delayed the (North's) timetable, and through the imposition of financial sanctions and the bans on the trade in weapons, has choked off significant funding which would have been channelled into prohibited activities'. The report to the UN Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against North Korea recommended imposing sanctions on four additional North Korean companies and 11 individuals. The drill used floating tank transporters on the Imjin river . The river crossing exercise came a month after the 'Foal Eagle' military drills ended . The exercise took place in Yeoncheon-gun, South Korea, with the flags of both countries adorning tanks . The council discussed the experts' report on Thursday and it will be up to members to decide whether they are added to the sanctions blacklist. To increase pressure on Kim Jong Un's regime, the United States and the European Union have gone beyond UN sanctions and imposed even tougher financial measures against North Korea. China, which is Pyongyang's closest ally and economic lifeline, supported the UN sanctions. In a sign of growing discontent with the North, the state-run Bank of China, one of the country's largest, halted business earlier this month with a North Korean bank accused by the US of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs. The floating rafts for transporting heavy military vehicles were seen at the exercise today in Yeoncheon, South Korea . South Korean soldiers from 6th Engineer Brigade in the large river-crossing exercise today . The panel said North Korea 'has continued to defy the international community in a series of actions which has heightened concerns about its intentions'. It cited the North's ballistic missile launch on December 12, its third nuclear test on February 12, and its declaration that it would reactivate nuclear facilities at its Yongbyon nuclear complex. 'The DPRK has continued its efforts to . import and export items relevant to missile and nuclear programs and . arms,' the panel said, using the initials of the country's official . name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The river crossing exercise was a rehearsal for the joint US and South Korean response to a show of the North's military strength . Soldiers and M1A2 tanks from the US Army's 2nd Infantry Division and South Korean 6th Engineer Brigade Soldiers cross a river during their combined exercise at the Imjin river . The report listed North Korean sanctions violations over a five-year period including the seizure of aluminum alloys suspected to be nuclear related in August 2012, and the seizure of missile-related items bound for Syria in May 2012. Given the North's 'consistent sanctions evasion,' the panel recommended that the country's newly created Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry and its minister, who has not yet been named, be added to the sanctions list.","More than 300 American and 95 South Korean troops were on the Imjin River .

"By . James Chapman . UPDATED: . 13:25 EST, 24 January 2012 . Labour joined forces with Church of England bishops and Lib Dem rebels last night to try to wreck flagship plans for an annual limit on welfare handouts. Ministers reacted with fury as Church leaders suggested that capping benefits at a maximum of Â£26,000 a year was somehow un-Christian. The bishops helped inflict a dramatic defeat in the House of Lords, with one even invoking the Bible as he argued against the Governmentâs plans. Scroll down for video . Debate: The Rt Reverend John Packer delivers his speech to the House of Lords last night ahead of the vote which saw the bishops, Labour and Liberal Democrat peers vote for an amendment to the motion . Speech: The Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, the Rt Rev John Packer, tabled an amendment which would exclude child benefit payments from the Â£500-a-week limit . An issue of fairness: David Cameron, pictured at a Q&A session with Asda workers yesterday asked whether it was right that people should be able to earn more than Â£26,000 just through benefits alone . The decision to back an amendment to the Coalition plans is a major gamble for under-pressure Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has been anxious to present himself as on the side of hard-working families who play by the rules. A weekend poll showed 76 per cent of the public are in favour of the benefit cap, including 69 per cent of Labour voters. The YouGov survey also found that a significant minority â 36 per cent â want still tougher measures, saying no household should get more than Â£20,000 in welfare payments. Gamble: Ed Miliband's decision to back the amendment could lead to problems, especially as a recent survey showed 69 per cent of Labour voters are in favour of the scheme . Despite the Lords defeat, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is vowing to stick to his guns. He branded the vote a âdisgraceâ and accused Labour of sending a âvery clear message they see nothing wrong with unlimited handoutsâ or with a situation where claimants make more by staying at home than working. The Coalition says workless households should not receive more than the average family in work earns after tax. Official figures published yesterday showed 67,000 households are receiving more than Â£26,000 a year in welfare payments and would be affected by the proposed cap. The Â£26,000 figure is equivalent to the average household income of working families after tax and including any benefits. Prime Minister David Cameron said: âItâs a basic issue of fairness. Should people really be able to earn more than Â£26,000 just through benefits alone? I donât believe they should. And I think the overwhelming majority of people in the country would back that view. âThe criticism I get from many people is that Â£26,000 is too much. You have to earn Â£35,000 [before tax to take home Â£26,000] â thatâs a salary far higher than the average salary in our country.â Mr Duncan Smith said: âThe purpose of this is not to punish people but it is to give fairness to people who are paying tax, who are commuting large distances because they can only afford to live in the houses that they have chosen. âIt is also about fairness to those who are on these benefits; it is not fair to trap somebody in an expensive house which they cannot afford then to go to work on the back of, because they would lose their housing benefit if they went to work â so they are disincentivised from going to work.â But peers voted by 252 to 237, a majority of 15, in favour of an amendment tabled by the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, the Right Reverend John Packer, which received Labour backing. Twenty-six Lib Dem peers â including former party leader Lord Ashdown â also voted against the Government. Liam Byrne (left) told the Commons that if his . party's 'safeguards' on homelessness were not accepted, Labour peers . would vote against the Government in a crucial vote on amendments to its . flagship Welfare Reform Bill. Iain Duncan Smith (right) has described it as a 'wrecking' amendment . They voted to change legislation to exclude child benefit from the cap, a move which ministers say would mean some households continuing to receive as much as Â£50,000 from the state. They also suggest it creates a âperverse incentiveâ for workless families to have more and more children. Labour says it supports the principle of the cap but said it was concerned about the costs of families who might be made homeless as their handouts are reducted. It backed the bishops and said it aimed to further amend the legislation when it returns to the Commons. Do you think Â£26,000-a-year benefits cap is fair? Bishop Packer invoked the Bible as he argued against the Governmentâs plans. âThree-quarters of those affected by the cap are children,â he said. âIt cannot be right for the cap to be the same for a childless couple as for a couple with children. âChristianity, along with other faiths and beliefs, requires us to think most of those that have no voice of their own. Children are one of the most evident examples of that. âChildren have no vote in our society. This amendment goes some way to protect them.â But welfare reform minister Lord Freud said: âThe worst thing for youngsters is to be in a workless household. We need to change behaviours and this benefit cap is designed to do that. âLike other welfare benefits, child benefit is provided by the state and funded by taxpayers and therefore we believe it is right it is taken into account along with other state benefits when applying the cap. Twitter row: People took to the social networking site yesterday with many explaining their exasperation over the level being set at Â£26,000 . âThe effect of excluding child benefit would simply be that families on child benefit would have an income higher than average earnings â there would be no upper limit to the amount of benefit a household could receive as that would clearly depend on the number of children.â Labourâs Lord McKenzie said his party backed the principle of a cap, but claimed it âdramatically increased the prospectsâ of people becoming homeless and could force councils to pick up the costs of re-housing them. A source close to Mr Duncan Smith said: âLabour are an absolute disgrace and have sent a very clear message to the public that they see nothing wrong with people receiving unlimited handouts, instead of doing the decent thing and going out to work. âThis now goes back to the Commons and we will overturn it.

"By . Chris Slack . UPDATED: . 13:35 EST, 5 February 2012 . They have long been championed as a way to combat global warming by creating clean energy. But wind farms can actually alter the climate according to a new study by a group of American scientists. The team from the University of Illinois found that daytime temperatures around wind farms can fall by as much as 4C, while at night temperatures can increase. Climate changers? A study has found that wind farms can cause daytime temperatures to drop by as much as 4C while increasing temperatures at night . The study found that currently the effect is restricted to areas near to the turbines, but the increase in larger farms could create weather changes on a regional scale. The study was led by Somnath Roy, assistant professor of atmospheric sciences at the university, with the San Gorgonio wind farm in California the focal point of his research. He found that the day ground temperature behind turbines was up to 4C lower than in front. He suggested that the turbines' blades scoop warm from the ground and push the cooler air downwards. This is then reversed at night. Research: Somnath Roy of the University of Illinois conducted the study into climate around wind farms . Roy, whose findings were published in the Sunday Times, added that he believes the turbines causing turbulence and reducing winds speed are the cause. He also added that the churning of air from low to high can create vortices that could extend the phenomenon for large distances downwind. Roy's research is supported by a study undertaken by the Iowa State University, who looked at how a 100-turbine farm would affect conditions on farmland. They found that temperatures on the ground were warmer at night, which in turn allowed plants to breathe more. While scientists in the United States have conducted research into the effects of wind farms on climate, such research in the UK is at an early stage. Currently no measurements have been made on changes to weather around British farms despite plans to increase turbines by tenfold. The UK currently has 3,500 wind turbines, with a further 800 under construction. The Government aim to have 10,000 onshore and 4,300 offshore by 2020, but the rapid growth has led to 101 Tory MPs writing to David Cameron about the proposal. The members are calling for a dramatic cut in subsidies to onshore wind farms and more influence for local people to stop them being built. The move is seen as a major revolt against government policy and sees the politicians join forces with other parties to express serious concerns over the level of taxpayers' money going to the sector. Opposition: Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris, left, has organised a letter signed by 101 Tory MPs, including Nicholas Soames, demanding a dramatic cut in subsidies to onshore wind farms . The letter was organised by backbencher Chris Heaton-Harris and has senior signatories including David Davis and Nicholas Soames. In the letter, which was seen by the Sunday Telegraph, they wrote: 'In these financially straitened times, . we think it is unwise to make consumers pay, through taxpayer subsidy, . for inefficient and intermittent energy production that typifies onshore . wind turbines.' They also expressed concerns that the . proposed National Planning Policy Framework 'diminishes the chances of . local people defeating onshore wind farm proposals through the planning . system'. State help for one of the most controversial sources of renewable energy is being cut but only slowly, under plans set out by ministers last year. Speaking about the letter a Downing Street spokesman said: 'We need a low carbon infrastructure and onshore wind is a cost effective and valuable part of the UK's diverse energy mix. 'The Government has commissioned a . review of subsidy levels and we are already proposing a cut for onshore . wind subsidies to take into account the fact that costs are coming down. 'We are committed to giving local . communities the power to shape the spaces in which they live and are . getting rid of regional targets introduced by the last government.'","Temperatures can fall by up to 4C downwind of farms .

The scandal-hit bank yesterday confirmed the fat cat will âretireâ â aged 49 â at the end of June as part of its clear-out of the old guard. Pay off: Rich Ricci, Barclays director, is leaving the bank after 19 years, just weeks after receiving an Â£18million shares windfall . But in a move described last night as a âfinal insultâ, Barclays confirmed that the former right-hand man of Bob Diamond will still receive the Â£700,000 golden goodbye â roughly a yearâs salary. Mr Ricci could also be eligible for millions of pounds in share bonuses awarded in previous years, subject to determination by the bankâs remuneration committee. Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins thanked Mr Ricci for his âmajor contribution to Barclays over the past 19 yearsâ. Mr Ricci has become a lightning rod for public anger over âfat catâ pay and the risks associated with casino banking, particularly since Mr Diamond was forced to quit last summer.

For Wimbledon is increasing prize money by a staggering 40 per cent â making it the biggest winnings pot in the history of professional tennis. At this yearâs competition, the All England Club will hand out a total of Â£22.6million â an increase of Â£6.5million â but the move has provoked an angry backlash from tennis fans.

FRENCH OPEN - Â£18.8m with Â£1.28m for singles champions . Winners of the menâs and ladiesâ singles titles this year will take home Â£1.6million, up from the . Â£1.15million which Roger Federer and Serena Williams netted last year. And the players who lose in the early rounds will enjoy even bigger pay increases, earning 62 per cent more than last year. Players who lose in the first round of the singles will be paid Â£23,500, which is more than some school teachers earn in a year. After the announcement was made . yesterday, chairman of the All England Club Philip Brook was asked to . justify the increase at a time when the UK economy is in the doldrums. âThe economic climate is difficult, I would accept that,â he said. What it looks like now:Â  Wimbledon expects to complete the roof over No 1 Court (right) in time for The Championships 2019 . Play on: The roof over Centre Court has been regarded as a success since its installation in 2009 . âBut I think we have to accept that . the world that we live in is a world where we are competing with other . international tennis events. âIt is not just about the top players, it is about making the sport attractive to the next generation of talent.â The new investment was partly in . response to players demanding a larger percentage of the competitionâs . revenue â usually around 20 per cent. Mr Brook said: âWe wanted to demonstrate to all the players how much they are appreciated by Wimbledon. Pay rise: Both the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles champions will each receive Â£1.6m this year, pictured here are the 2012 victors Roger Federer and Serena Williams . 'We have made these increases because . we want to make them, not because we had to.â But critics took to social . networking site Twitter to condemn the extravagant increases. Linda MacDonald said it was . âexcessiveâ, while Tim Whittall wrote: âWhat is wrong with us? There are . people starving and homeless!â It was also announced that a . retractable roof will built over Court One by 2019, following the . success of Centre Courtâs roof installed in 2009, and the grounds will . be redeveloped in the theme of âtennis in an English country gardenâ. Mr Brook refused to comment on how much the renovations would cost, but insisted âfans wonât pay the priceâ. This year's Championships take place from June 24-July 7. By Mike Dickson, Sportsmail's tennis correspondent . Those who regard Wimbledon as slightly staid or old fashioned have always profoundly misunderstood the All England Club, never more so than when it comes to this announcement of jaw dropping prize money increasesÂ  and yet more redevelopment of the grounds. 'We cannot afford to stand still,' was the mantra of Chairman Philip Brook as he unveiled the most significant prize pot rises in the history of tennis, along with long-term development plans that include the building of a new roof on No 1 Court. It is all about maintaining the tournamentâs position as, arguably, the most successful annual event in any sport and certainly in tennis â something that does not come without a talent for innovation and surprise. There was an air of democracy around the 40% rise in the player payment fund, with the massive jump of 60%-plus for early round losers the latest statement from the four Grand Slams that they care about the rank-and-file performers who fill out the draw. And it was emphasised that it will not be the ordinary fans through the gate who foot the bill, with a pledge to keep ticket prices steady and the money coming from increased commercial activity and aspects like the huge new television deal announced with China. Yet it is a tricky time to announce bumper paydays for young athletes in the current economic climate and the reward-for-failure argument has a ring of truth to it as well, especially in the womenâs game. With Wimbledon now wedded to the idea of equal prize money the high proportion of one-sided matches on the womenâs side in the first week will see the vanquished banking Â£23,500 for their trouble. That will prove more contentiousÂ  than the champions getting Â£1.6m, which they will hardly notice. And the scramble for wildcards among British hopefuls will be more intense than ever, and probably subject of more rancour. Small wonder when the minimum a player would receive for gaining entry into the singles and doubles is now Â£27,375. What is effectively happening is that Wimbledon and the other three Slams are propping up the finances of the players ranked below 60 who, with some justification, have complained that the more regular tour events are not sufficiently rewarding them, given the costs of travelling on a global circuit. It also represents another victory for the Association of Tennis Professionals who, with their Player Council led by the hugely influential Roger Federer, have secured unprecedented pay rises for their constituents. Their female counterparts have quietly ridden in their slipstream on the matter, and must be absolutely ecstatic. The long-term plans for the grounds look superb, with much consideration given to the overall spectator experience, which already rates very highly. The truth is that No 1 Court, which is only sixteen years old, has never quite generated the atmosphere that was hoped and a substantial redesign, and the facility for wet weather play, will be a welcome development if it is done with flair. No, there is not much standing still down at SW19, where the recession appears a distant rumour.","Wimbledon singles champions will each receive Â£1.6m - up Â£450,000 .

Just imagine going to bed and then waking up in the morning weighing a couple of pounds less. It sounds like the dieting miracle millions have been waiting for but it's one a new book claims is now possible to achieve. Last week we serialised an exciting new slimming plan by U.S. weight-loss expert, Dr Caroline Apovian. Her Overnight Diet claims you can lose up to 9lb every week by sticking to one non-food day (in which you drink homemade smoothies and drop 2lb as you sleep) and then six days of eating foods which diets usually ban - including potatoes and peanut butter. The secret to its success lies in doing everything you can to preserve muscle. We all lose muscle mass as we age - at the rate of one per cent a year from the age of 30 - and dieting can make this worse. When the body detects a significant drop in food intake it looks to your muscles for extra energy. This means you get thinner - but you also get weaker and flabbier when the weight creeps back on as fatÂ  as it does for 95 per cent of dieters. Last week we showed the smoothie recipes that will keep you feeling full on the no-food day and outlined the eating rules to abide by. If you missed it you can find this first part by searching for 'overnight diet' at dailymail.co.uk. Today, in the final part of our exclusive serialisation, we explain how a quick and simple exercise regime done just a few days each week is the most effective way to keep your body in the best shape it can be. The government recommends you find 30 minutes each day for fitness to maintain your weight and 90 minutes a day if you want to start shifting the pounds. But who has the time and inclination - especially if you're on a diet and feeling hungry - to do that? In fact, Dr Apovian is convinced the exercise recommendations of not just the government but also many popular diets could actually be preventing you from reaching your weight-loss goals. 'For decades, diets have been promoting aerobic exercise as the best way to burn calories and shed pounds,' she says. 'But the combination of very low-calorie diets with hours of cardiovascular exercise may put the body into a catabolic state in which it robs the muscles for fuel.' Instead, Dr Apovian has devised a short, sharp exercise plan which will not just maintain the muscle you do have but also add more - so speeding up your metabolism - without bulking you up. This workout plan is based on a growing body of research that shows combining resistance training with short bursts of cardiovascular activity burns far more body fat than doing the two separately. In short you get double the impact in half the time. She recommends doing it four times a week. The easy-to-follow exercises outlined here strengthen nearly every major muscle group in the body while improving balance and flexibility. And you don't have to join a gym or invest in any special equipment; you can do Dr Apovian's 21 minute workout any time, anywhere - so there are no excuses! Works: Abdomen, chest, shoulders and triceps (bingo wings) Works: Chest, shoulders, triceps and abdominals . The Overnight Diet Workout . Worls: Calves, thighs, hips, buttocks and abdominals . Start each session with a three-minute 'dynamic warm-up'. The aim is to warm up the muscles all around your body and raise your heart rate. So, run through various vigorous leg and arm moves - marching on the spot bringing your knees up high; then take your legs behind you, kicking your bottom with your heels as you march; swing your leg from side to side, moving your arms above and around your head as you do so. Then, with one eye on a stop-watch, start doing the strength-training exercises (outlined in the box to the right) in two-minute blasts interspersed with one-minute bursts of aerobic activity called 'rev-up blasts'. These 60-second blasts are designed to get your heart pumping - try fast walking, marching on the spot, or sprinting fast (depending on your fitness levels), running up and down steps, star jumps, or, if you are already quite fit, 'toe touch jumps' (raise both arms above your head, then crouch down and touch your toes, then jump as you bring them up over your head again and repeat). Each strength-training exercise is designed to work on one group of muscles at a time - from the buttocks, legs and tummy, to your chest and arms - concentrating on the biggest muscle groups for maximum impact. The important thing is to move quickly without taking any breaks, and vary your selection of exercises each time to keep different muscle groups working. Start at the simplest level, but adjust the difficulty as you get fitter and stronger (you'll know as soon as the exercise starts to feel easy and this will be quicker than you think!). These easy moves can help you tone up forever, according to the Overnight Diet . Works: Buttocks, rear thighs and lower back . Keep the weight off long term . If you follow the Overnight Diet diligently you could lose as much as 9lb in a week, more than a stone in two weeks, and, if you stick to the plan, you could even be 2Â½st lighter by this time next month. When you reach your ideal weight - which will be sooner than you think - it is very important not to simply revert to your old, bad dietary habits once you can comfortably get into your skinny jeans again. Dr Apovian's studies show it is easy to maintain your new shape if you commit to always getting your daily protein allowance (which we explained how to work out last week) and regular muscle-strengthening exercise sessions.

A 75-year-old conman has been jailed for six years after pocketing Â£90,000 from the sale of a house he didn't even own. Brian Kiddell posed as the owner of the home in Newton Abbot, Devon, and put the house up for sale on the internet. The real owner had no idea what was going on until he happened to drive past the property and noticed an estate agent's For Sale board outside. When he alerted police, he discovered that Kiddell had already completed the sale and made off with the money. Brian Kiddell, pictured left, has been jailed for six years for posing as the owner of a property in Newton Abbot, Devon, pictured, which . he then sold for Â£90,000 on the internet in one of his most elaborate . frauds . Gareth Evans, prosecuting, said: 'Kiddell had been renting the house for four months when the owner happened, purely by chance, to be driving past and noticed there was a For Sale sign outside the address. 'He contacted his own letting agent and the estate agent and found that it was being sold on behalf of a company called Momentum Asset Management.' Exeter Crown Court heard how the house sale con was just one in a long line of complex frauds Kiddell carried out using a string of false identities. He bought expensive clothes at a shop in Budleigh Salterton, Exeter, Devon, using cheques made out in the name of Paul Stevenson that were worthless. In Essex, Kiddell impersonated two different people to try to extract money from bank accounts in Leigh on Sea and Canvey Island. In court: Kiddell was jailed for six years at Exeter Crown Court, pictured, for nine charges of fraud, theft and dishonest use of a dead man's passport . In one case he claimed the account holder had died and presented a fake death certificate. He claimed to be the dead man's brother but the bank blocked the transfer of Â£18,000 when they found the real customer was alive and well. His next scheme involved using false documents to create a joint account with a customer at a bank in Canvey Island so he could transfer their money to himself. He withdrew Â£4,500 before the scam was stopped. Kiddell was finally caught when staff at a Barclay's Bank in Launceston, Cornwall, became suspicious and called police when he tried to apply for a Â£25,000 loan by using the stolen account details of a legitimate customer. Former Squash Club owner Kiddell, who has been jailed twice before for similar offences, admitted nine charges of fraud, theft, and the dishonest use of a dead man's passport. He was jailed for a total of six years by Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, who told him: 'You are no stranger to fraud. You are a persistent fraudster who thrives on dishonesty as a method of behaviour. 'You played a key role in these frauds, and there were many. There were others involved but you knew full well what was going on. 'You pretended to be the owner of a house which you had leased in a false name, or at least the owner's representative, and you sold the property.

When 41-year-old Maria Bajo first went for Botox injections four years ago, she was hoping - like most who get the treatment - to look more youthful afterwards. 'I'm a fitness instructor,' says Maria, who lives in North-West London. 'I was making a fitness DVD with a colleague, and I hated the lines I saw on my face. I thought Botox would be a quick and easy way to get rid of them.' But while the injections, which cost Â£150 a time, did smooth away the lines, Maria was left with another problem. 'I am a very strong, positive person, but I quickly began to feel depressed. I couldn't raise my eyebrows and my face was an expressionless blank which didn't reflect my normally sunny personality. If you can't smile properly and your face feels frozen, you don't just look unhappy - it makes you feel miserable too.' Maria Bajo, a fitness instructor, left, did not like the effects of Botox, right, which left her looking and feeling miserable - and a new study suggests she is not the only one to whom this has happened . While many devotees and needle-wielding doctors might scoff, a new study suggests she is not the only one who's suffering in this way. At a conference earlier this month, psychologist Dr Michael Lewis of Cardiff University presented research that showed many women who have Botox to get rid of laughter lines can feel the way Maria did - depressed, because they are no longer able to smile properly. Generally we assume that our facial expressions reflect rather than direct our emotions, but it's more complicated than that. 'The expressions we make on our face affect the emotions we feel. We smile because we're happy, but the act of smiling itself also makes us happy,' explains Dr Lewis. His findings are the latest to suggest that the world's favourite anti-ageing drug could be doing more than simply freezing our facial muscles - it could be changing the way that we think and feel. Botox is in fact a brand name that hasbecome shorthand for botulinum toxin, but it's just one of several brands which are available to the thousands prepared to pay upwards of Â£150 a time for injections every three to six months. An estimated one million treatments were carried out last year in the UK alone. It might seem unlikely that paralysing the muscles in our face can affect our brain, but theÂ  idea that facial expressions can influence emotions is a recognised psychological phenomenon. The 'facial feedback mechanism' was identified in 1988 by psychologists who showed that people who held a pen in their teeth in a position that used the same muscles as smiling found a cartoon more amusing than those who held a pen in their lips in a way that stopped them from smiling. Maria after her Botox, left, and at work as a fitness instructor, right . The theory is that drugs that prevent . us from being able to make particular facial expressions interfere with . the messages that go back and forth between the face and the brain. The . result? We struggle to feel the things that we'd normally feel when . making that facial expression. Dr . Lewis is not the first to suggest that Botox could have a role to play . in mental health. Over the past few years a growing number of doctors . have suggested that Botox could be used as an anti-depressant. The . theory is based on the same facial feedback mechanism, but proponents . argue that if you paralyse only the muscles involved in frowning, and . not those involved in smiling or laughing, you can prevent people from . feeling sad. In a new . book, The Face Of Emotion - How Botox Affects Our Moods And . Relationships, U.S. dermatologist Dr Eric Finzi explores this idea. 'My . theory is that by preventing the physical action of frowning, we . interrupt this feedback loop and reduce the number of negative messages . the brain is receiving, creating a more positive outlook,' he says. New findings suggest that the world's favourite anti-ageing drug could be doing more than simply freezing our facial muscles - it could be changing the way that we think and feel . He makes it sound so simple - stick to paralysing frown lines on the forehead, leave laughter lines around the eyes alone, and you'll not only look younger, you'll also feel happier. Unfortunately it's not as straightforward as that for everyone. Take Alice Shaw. She only had her frown lines and not her laughter lines treated, yet the result was far from positive. Alice, 49, from West London, works as a support officer for adults with special needs. When she was in her early 40s, she started having Botox on the lines in her forehead. 'I had these deep frown lines, which I . hated. But the Botox didn't make me any happier. The skin on my . forehead looked frozen, and I found it hard to smile,' she says. 'I . am naturally a very happy, smiley person and it made me sad that I no . longer looked as happy as I used to. I think your face should reflect . the person that you are inside and with a smooth, bland face I just . didn't look like myself any more.' This sense of detachment fromÂ  your own body is a common complaint among those who feel that Botox has shifted their outlook. Amanda, 38, is another woman who . found that Botox didn't just make her depressed, it also made her feel . distanced from her friends - and herself. Alice Shaw, 49, became downhearted when she no longer resembled the smiley, happy person she once was after having Botox . After her first set of Botox . injections in August 2011, she was delighted to see the wrinkles on her . forehead and the laughter lines around her eyes soften. 'I felt . refreshed, which was exactly the result I was looking for,' she says. But . after a few weeks, Amanda started to feel emotionally detached. Incidents that would normally have made her laugh didn't even raise a . smile. She felt as if by paralysing the . muscles of her face, she had numbed her emotions, too. 'My face was . heavy and I felt like all the light went out of my eyes. 'Instead of feeling happy and excited I . felt empty and depressed. It was as if I'd become removed from my life. I felt trapped.' More . worryingly for her, this had an affect on her social interactions. 'Usually I'm known for being a sensitive person but after the Botox, I . was shocked to find that I'd actually inadvertently hurt people quite . badly because they thought I was being insensitive. 'I'm sure it was because my face looked so uncharacteristically hard and didn't express empathy or affection.' In a new book, The Face Of Emotion - How Botox Affects Our Moods And Relationships, U.S. dermatologist Dr Eric Finzi explores this idea . Being perceived as lacking in compassion doesn't just alienate our friends - over time it can actually make us more miserable, too. This is because our view of ourselves is largely formed by what we see reflected back to us. So if we present a blank and emotionless face to the world and, as a result, people behave towards us as if we're insensitive or rude, we start to believe we really are insensitive and rude. As Professor Nichola Rumsey, co-director of the Centre For Appearance Research at the University of the West of England, explains: 'There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that if the face is less mobile, whether from Botox or facial palsy, people can't use non-verbal communication - the most powerful kind ofÂ  communication - appropriately. 'This is likely to negatively affect their interactions with others and the quality of communication for both parties.' Given that most Botox today is more subtle than total facial paralysis, you might think this sounds like an extreme scenario. But research has shown that, for reasons we don't entirely understand, people who have had even a small amount of Botox take longer to respond to emotional events than those who haven't. And when a friend is looking to you for comfort, that fraction of a second's delay in expressing empathy can make all the difference. Interestingly, even those who don't believe that Botox has made them dramatically happier or significantly less depressed can still concede that it has affected their personality. Emma Bradley, 27, from Gloucester, runs her own modelling agency. She tried Botox for the first time a few years ago. 'I first became interested in Botox because I wanted to get rid of the fine lines around my eyes and forehead. I was modelling at the time and felt I needed to look my best.' After her first injection, Emma noticed that not only had her lines started to soften, but that Botox also made her respond differently to the demands of her busy job. 'I'm far less emotional than I used to be,' she says, 'and because nothing else in my life has changed, I can only think that it's down to the Botox.' For Dr Lewis, this is the crux of the problem - the fact that many women blithely choose to have these injections without knowing that it could be having an impact on their feelings. Like many in the medical community, he believes that more research needs to be done in this area. But, he says, we might want to reassess our cavalier attitude to doing away with facial expressions; as he explains, they have an important role to play in our lives. 'Lines are formed by emotions and emotions are important because they guide us. In some cases, preventing an excess of sadness could be a good thing. 'But anyone who is having Botox needs to be aware of the potential psychological effect,' he says. If you simply want to smooth out a few wrinkles, finding your personality has been changed as a result could be too high a price to pay for a youthful face.

Highly anticipated next U.S. ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy has put two pieces of land on Marthaâs Vineyard up for sale. The former first daughter is asking for a whopping combined asking price of $45 million for the two parcels at her exclusive Red Gate Farm estate.

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis paid $1.1 million for the 366-acre parcel known as Red Gate Farm back in 1978. The house she built, which Caroline currently owns, sits on about 106 acres of that plot.

Although no official figure has been put on Kennedy's wealth, her net worth estimated to top $100 million.

Caroline Kennedy has reportedly been asked to serve as the next American ambassador to Japan.

The Washington Post has reported that the appointment will be welcomed by the Japanese who have enjoyed having high profile ambassadors in the past.

The ex-girlfriend of one of the Boston bombers has revealed that he tried to turn her against the U.S. and beat her if she wore Western clothing. Nadine Ascencao says that over the course of her relationship with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, he was transformed from a fun-loving student into an Islamic extremist who shunned American life. The 24-year-old lost her virginity to the Chechen immigrant and said she was besotted with him - but now she admits she had a 'lucky escape'. Extremist: Tamerlan Tsarnaev apparently tried to force his ex-girlfriend Nadine Ascencao to convert to Islam . Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a stand-off with police four days after he and his brother Dzhokhar apparently set off two bombs at the Boston Marathon on April 15. Since the terror attack, which left three by-standers dead and more than 170 injured, the brothers' interest in Islamic terror has been revealed. Ms Ascencao told The Sun: 'One minute he's this funny, normal guy who liked boxing and having fun, the next he is praying four times a day, watching Islamic videos and talking insane nonsense. 'He became extremely religious and tried to brainwash me to follow Islam. Tamerlan said I couldn't be with him unless I became a Muslim. He wanted me to hate America like he did.' Wife: The suspected bomber went on to marry Katherine Russell, who became a Muslim at his urging . Tsarnaev apparently stopped her from listening to pop music or watching television, and tried to control who she spent time with. 'Tamerlan told me I should only talk to Muslim girls, not other ""slutty"" girls,' Ms Ascencao said. And when she wore Western clothing, he would fly into a rage and even attack her, she added. 'He hated my tight trousers and made me wear long skirts,' she told The Sun. 'Towards the end I was wearing a hijab. He once ripped a pair of my jeans and hit me in the face with them.' The pair's relationship seems to have hit the rocks after Tsarnaev started seeing Katherine Russell after meeting her at a nightclub. He would apparently play the two women off against each other, pitting them in competition to learn Islamic verses. Killed: Tamerlan, right, with his brother Dzhokhar, died after a stand-off with police in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing . Terror: Runners at the finish line of the marathon at the time of the atrocity on April 15 . A police report from July 2009 indicated that he slapped Ms Ascencao during an argument at their home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She called 911 to complain, but although Tsarnaev was arrested and charged with assault the charges were dropped before trial. The couple broke up later that year after three years together, and he went on to marry Ms Russell, who converted to Islam in order to be with him. Ms Ascencao says she had no contact with her ex-boyfriend in the years before he launched his terror attack this month, but was questioned by the FBI over her links to the Islamic extremist. 'When they said Tamerlan was dead, I didn't cry,' she told The Sun. 'I was more shocked Dzhokhar was involved. He was a nice kid.' Dzhokhar, 19, is currently in police custody in hospital after being injured in a shoot-out with police which led to his arrest hours after Tamerlan's death on April 19.","Nadine Ascencao, 24, dated Tamerlan Tsarnaev for three years .

A friend of Jimmy Savile told The Times newspaper that members of the presenter's 'Friday Morning Club' - said to have met at his penthouse regularly over a period of 20 years - included up to nine serving and retired police officers. There is no suggestion that the men involved were aware that Savile was involved in abuses, or that he was being investigated in relation to allegations of child abuse by officers in other parts of the country.

Savile allegedly claimed he was doing disabled people a 'big favour' by having sex with them it has emerged. The claims were made by an anonymous record company promoter, who met the DJ briefly in 1972. The man, who didn't want to be named, told the Daily Mirror he was horrified at Savile's boasts about having sex with girls in wheelchairs and paraplegics at Stoke Mandeville Hospital. The man claimed Savile said: 'They wouldn't get any sex if it wasn't for me'. Former Director of Nursing and Patient Care at Stoke Mandeville, Christine McFarlane, also told ITV he was given too much freedom and staff feared he would stop fundraising if they angered him. She told ITV: 'Jimmy walked through the doors, everywhere, and because he was Jimmy Savile, nobody argued with him. 'When he first offered to raise money nobody thought he would raise the money to build the spinal unit, but he did it and did it very quickly. 'The nursing staff were extremely grateful and the gratitude spilt over into making him feel more powerful. 'Along with the power, people were afraid of Jimmy stopping raising money for the hospital. There was a fear of him taking something away. He argued that it was his and not theirs.' Earlier Mr Pratt told the BBC that Savile would arrive at Leeds General Infirmary with the girls in the early hours of the morning and then leave before dawn. The former porter said: 'He would go up and the lad on the desk would say âHereâs the key, Jim, make sure I get it back.â 'Heâd take the key and would walk out and the two women would follow him towards the nursesâ home.' A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'We are concerned to hear the allegations which have been made by Mr Pratt and have been quoted widely in the media. 'We have investigated his claims . today with other staff who were around at Leeds General Infirmary at the . time and we believe he is mistaken in his comments. Mr Pratt appears to . have been talking about a period in the 1980s before he started work at . the hospital in 1990 and not from first-hand knowledge. 'The . assurance we have been given is that the porters did not have a key to . unlock the nursesâ home. The building had a warden on duty 24 hours a . day and we understand access was very strictly controlled to protect the . staff living there.' In honour: Jimmy Savile at Stoke Mandeville next to a placard to commemorate his 'hard work' for the hospital . Abuse: Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury where Savile was allegedly free to prey upon young patients . The Trust said that Savile had been given his own office for around a decade, from the mid 1990s until 2006. A spokesman said: 'He was an occasional visitor to this office but we have no information to suggest any improper use of this room.' Another potential victim, a former . patient at Broadmoor, told ITV that she was put in solitary confinement . after complaining that Savile had groped her. The . woman, who remained anonymous, said: 'When he put his arm around me, I . thought he was just comforting me because he could see I was upset but I . didnât know what the heck was going on. 'Then . when he started getting a bit too affectionate, when he put his hand . between my legs and tried to get intimate with me, I didnât like that.' The . claims come as Scarborough council announced it is to consider . posthumously stripping Savile of his Freedom of the Borough, which he . was awarded in 2005. Allegations: There have been claims Savile would arrive at Leeds General Infirmary (pictured) with the girls in the early hours of the morning and then leave before dawn .

A Russian attack sub was given safe harbor in Florida during Hurricane Sandy after it was detected just 200 miles from the East Coast, it emerged today. The Sierra-2 class submarine was believed to be part of the country's Northern Fleet, outfitted with SS-N-21 anti-submarine warfare missiles, . SS-N-16 anti-submarine warfare missiles, and torpedoes. This is the first time a Russian Sierra-2 class sub has been detected near the U.S. coast, reported theÂ Free Beacon, although U.S. defense officials are downplaying the potential threat. Harmless: U.S. officials say a Russian nuclear-powered attack given safe harbor from Hurricane Sandy 'as it posed no threat' (file picture) The Free Beacon's sources spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of ant-sub warfare. 'While I canât talk about how we detected it, I can tell you that things . worked the way they were supposed to,' one official said, adding that the submarine 'poses no threat whatsoever'. Officials said the submarine was probably conducting anti-submarine . warfare efforts against U.S. ballistic and cruise missile submarines at Kings Bay, Georgia. The submarine did not sail near Kings Bay or threaten a U.S. aircraft carrier group conducting exercises near it in the eastern Atlantic. There are two guided missile submarines and six nuclear missile submarines docked at Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base. Those American vessels are a known target of Russian attack subs. Iron man: Though Putin's regime has increased naval patrols and bomber flybys, U.S. defense officials have downplayed the incidents as President Obama seeks stronger political ties to Moscow . Flexing their muscle: Officials say Russian sub patrols have increased in recent years . However, the Russian sub was . considered safe enough that it was given a safe harbor in Jacksonville, . Florida's commercial port during Hurricane Sandy, within listening range . of Kings Bay. A . Jacksonville Port Authority spokeswoman declined to comment on the . submarine. At this time the submarine is thought to be hundreds of miles . from American shorelines. The deployment could be read as an effort by the Russian navy to re-establish naval power projection capabilities. Russia said as much in February when it announcing an increase in submarine . patrols in strategic waters around the world. 'On June 1 or a bit later we will resume constant patrolling of the . worldâs oceans by strategic nuclear submarines,' Russian Navy Commander . Admiral Vladimir Vysotsky said in February. Armed: The Sierra 2-class submarine was armed with anti-submarine missiles and torpedoes (file picture) 'A RussianÂ AGI and an SSN in the same geographic area as one of the . largest U.S. ballistic missile submarine basesâKings Bayâis reminiscent . of Cold War activities of the Soviet navy tracking the movements of our . SSBNâs,' said another U.S. official. SSBN is the designation for . ballistic missile submarines. Russia's . navy carried out hundreds of submarine patrols during the Cold War to . maintain first-and-second-strike nuclear capabilities. Even when the Soviet Union was in decline in 1984 it still conducted 230 submarine patrols. Today it conducts fewer than 10 a year. 'As . was their primary mission during the Cold War, Russian SSNs . [nuclear attack submarines] would likely be trying to track U.S. nuclear . missile submarines deploying from Kings Bay, Georgia, and to monitor . U.S. naval deployments from Norfolk, Virginia,' Richard Fisher, military . analyst with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, wore in . an email. A Russian attack sub was discovered near the U.S. coastline but defense officials said it posed no threat . Officials said the submarine was probably conducting anti-submarine warfare efforts against U.S. ballistic and cruise missile submarines at Kings Bay, Georgia . Fisher added that Russia is currently building new attack submarines to rival the U.S.'s Los Angeles-class vessels. In recent months there's been series of examples of Russia flexing its military strength near U.S. soil. Last summer saw the transit of two Bear-H strategic bombers near the Alaska . air defense zone during Russian strategic bomber war games in arctic. Then in an likely Fourth of July political message, on Independence Day a Russian Bear-H flew . the closest to the U.S. West Coast that a Russian strategic bomber had . flown since the Cold War when such flights were routine. In both cases U.S. and Canadian interceptor jets met the Russian bombers. But U.S. officials dismissed both incidents as the Obama administration seeks to establish closer ties to Moscow. Russia bombers have also been detected near Norway's airspace with a Bear H bomber spotted on Sept. 11 and 12 shadowed by NATO jet fighters. 55 Russian bombers have been detected near Norway's territory in 2012, a sharp increase from the early 2000s.","Nuclear-powered sub believed to be part of Russia's Northern Fleet .

Controversy: Speaker John Bercow spent more than Â£1,300 on a new shower screen, official documents showed today . CommonsÂ  Speaker John Bercow splashed out more than Â£1,300 on a shower screen for his official residence â billing it to the taxpayer. Official records for the Speakerâs expenses from 2010 onwards also show he spent Â£80 to repair a roller blind in a âbaby bedroomâ at his grace-and-favour apartments in Westminster which he shares with his wife Sally and their three children. Shower screens are available for as little as Â£35 over the internet â a fraction of the Â£1,320 cost of Mr Bercowâs screen. When asked why the replacement of a 'shower screen and side panels' cost Â£1,320, a spokesman told MailOnline: 'The shower cubicle needed to be repaired as a screen had become faulty and beyond economical repair, as well as dangerous as it was falling. 'The other screen was salvaged and therefore a new screen and connecting door were ordered to match the original.Â  This work was undertaken on the advice of the House maintenance team and not as a result of a request by the Speaker.' The figures released under the Freedom of Information Act also show Mr Bercow spent Â£45,825.68 on travel over the same period, most of it on international flights. This included Â£8,429.86 for the Speaker and a member of staff to fly to Washington and Boston. Hundreds were also spent ferrying him around London and larger sums on flights to Canada, India.

The Speaker also displayed a fondness for official cars. He repeatedly spent Â£74.40 for a . return journey to the neighbouring London postcode of SE1, which is no . more than Â£20 return in a taxi. The spokesman added: âThe Speaker has an extensive outreach programme and therefore undertakes significant travel.â He also Â£145.50 for his TV Licence as well as thousands in council tax. The details, released in a freedom of information response, show his spending over the last two years. In 2009 Mr Bercow had his flat refurbished at a cost of more than Â£45,000 to the taxpayer soon after he took the job. This was more than double the Â£20,000 he initially said he would be spending to make his official residence suitable for a family with three young children. Documents revealed Mrs Bercow asked Commons officials for a larger TV, a DVD player and wallpaper which would make the residence feel less like an office. But email exchanges showed some concern among officials about the cost of the work, with one pointing out that Mr Bercow had said he only wanted to spend what were considered to be 'reasonable' sums and noting that 'the list is getting longer'. The documents also revealed Mr Bercow spent almost Â£13,000 over three months on entertaining and hospitality, including Â£3,599 on a three-night trip to Rome to attend a G8 Speakers' conference.","FOI reveals Mr Bercow's spending including tens of thousands on travel, council tax and other costs .

Blame: Actress Penelope Keith has attacked women who get divorced later in life, saying they are to blame for pushing up house prices . As forthright Audrey Forbes-Hamilton in sitcom To The Manor Born, she was never afraid to speak her mind. Yesterday actress Penelope Keith spoke out to defend her real-life âmanorâ â taking aim at wind turbines, oligarchs and a generation of âsilver splittersâ. She blamed a surge in divorces among baby boomer couples for driving up property prices in the Home Counties, as newly-single women in their 50s and 60s bought up flats and cottages. And she lambasted developers who built âvast housing estatesâ in her adopted county of Surrey, and the super-rich oligarchs who filled its skies with helicopter traffic. Miss Keith, watched by millions in TV shows including The Good Life, gave a wide-ranging interview to Country Life magazine in which she said parts ofÂ  Surrey were under constant threat from developers. The actress, 73, conceded that the countyâs stockbroker-belt did need more affordable housing and appeared to blame baby boomer divorcees for driving up property prices. She said: âI read about affordable houses that are Â£300,000. Sorry? Affordable for whom? Itâs a terribly knotty problem. âIf only we could educate people to go on living together for longer. Itâs all these single dwellings, all these women in their 50s and 60s who suddenly want their own space, to be their own people. To do what?â Figures have shown that divorces among couples of retirement age â dubbed the âsilver splittersâ â have almost doubled in a decade, with the majority instigated by women. The phenomenon has been blamed on increased life expectancy, better health and a greater âlust for lifeâ among the baby boomers compared with previous generations. The comparative financial independence of women has also given them the freedom to leave their husbands â something earlier generations were less able to do. Actress Diana Quick was 61 when she separated from actor Bill Nighy last year, after a 28-year relationship. Sympathy: Keith, who starred as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton in To the Manor Born, has said she has no sympathy for women in their fifties who leave their husbands because they want 'their own space' Marriage: Keith has been married to her husband Rodney Timson for over 30 years. She met the twice-divorced policeman, who is eight years her junior while appearing on stage in Chichester, West Sussex . At the time, she said: âThere are far more couples splitting up in their 60s now and one reason is that they can. Economically, they have more independence.â Property sales have been affected by the surge in later-life divorces and estate agents have warned of a shortage of smaller properties as more people choose to live alone. In her interview, Miss Keith said London was now âtoo fullâ, placing increased demand on the surrounding Home Counties. Penelope Keith with To The Manor Born co-star Peter Bowles . She said: âVast housing estates built in the countryside remove the reason why people want to move to the country. If you want to embrace a culture, you canât flood it, but it seems they will never build just a few houses in an area.â Other threats to the Surrey countryside included helicopter traffic from the oligarchs who have bought gated mansions in St Georgeâs Hill and Wentworth, she warned. Surrey is the richest county for property wealth and has become a magnet for Russian oligarchs and other ânon-domsâ. Miss Keith, a former High Sheriff of Surrey who is involved with several charities and serves as one of the countyâs deputy lieutenants, questioned if the new wealthy residents wanted to be part of the traditional community. She said: âEveryone thinks you live among all these rich people, but you canât get near any of that moneyâ¦ How do I let them know about battered wives, or my prison charity, or the school in India? I donât think they want to know.â Miss Keith continued: âThere are wonderful places, such as the Surrey Hillsâ¦ but if youâre vulnerable or on the lower echelons, itâs pretty bloody awful.â She came to prominence with her portrayal of social-climbing Margot Leadbetter in The Good Life from 1975 to 1978, starring with Richard Briers, Felicity Kendal and Paul Eddington, and played lady of the manor Audrey fforbes-Hamilton in To The Manor Born, broadcast from 1979 to 1981. Miss Keith lives in a village near Godalming with her husband of 36 years, ex-policeman Rodney Timson. The couple also have a home in the Scottish Highlands, and Miss Keith questioned the impact of wind turbines built in the area. She said: âThere are a hell of a lot of wind farms in the Highlands. Do they really produce that much energy? I canât square the circle. âAs you enter London, it says youâre entering a low-emission zone just as overhead come these great jumbos spewing out more gunge than I would in my entire life.â Couples in their forties are most likely to divorce, but more men aged over 60 split than women of the same age (Source: Office for National Statistics)","Actress Penelope Keith attacked women who get divorced later in life .

More than a year after ash dieback was discovered in the UK, not a single product is available to tackle it . Fears are growing that most of Britainâs 80million ash trees could be lost because of delays in licensing potential treatments for a deadly disease. More than a year after ash dieback was discovered in the UK, not a single product is available to tackle it. A firm which has developed a promising treatment claims the Government has snubbed it despite independent laboratory tests showing it is effective. The airborne fungus â chalara fraxinea â is rife across mainland Europe, where in countries such as Denmark it has already affected 90 per cent of ash trees. With the infection confirmed at 501 sites across the UK, the Government is focused on identifying trees naturally resistant to the disease, which could then be used to restock affected woodlands. But with only a small percentage of trees likely to be impervious, millions will be left to wither and die. Conservationists and landowners fear this approach will scar the countryside for generations. Tim Mott, director of Natural Ecology Mitigation, says his company has developed a copper-based solution specifically designed to tackle tree disease. Independent laboratory tests at Reading University have found it effective against the fungus, as well as a host of other tree pathogens. But the firm has been unable to get on to the Government-funded shortlist of products for testing against ash dieback. Despite this, it is determined to get the treatment on to the market and is seeking Â£1.2million in private funding to undertake field trials. Fourteen potential treatments are being considered by the Government but with no deadline for approval, many ash owners are becoming increasingly anxious. The airborne fungus Â¿ chalara fraxinea Â¿ is rife across mainland Europe, where in countries such as Denmark it has already affected 90 per cent of ash trees . Baron Imre von Maltzahn, who has 10,000 ash on his 400-acre Shelswell estate, near Bicester, Oxfordshire, said the Governmentâs approach was âbafflingâ. âIâm certainly in favour of trying to do something rather than just sitting on our hands, and would use a treatment if available,â he said. Graham Taylor is managing director of Pryor and Rickett, a woodland management consultancy. He said several clients â from estate owners to those with a single ash â are willing to spend their own funds to protect their trees. âIt is frustrating for those that just want to get on and try. They may well find the solution that the Government does not seem to want to find.â Plant physiologist Dr Glynn Percival, who tested the treatment developed by Mr Mottâs firm, says ash dieback can be tackled. âIt is a fungus and can be treated with a fungicide, as simple as that. 'The results for this new treatment are very positive. Although we have yet to carry out field trials, if I were a gambling man I would have no qualms saying that this product used in the right concentration will give control against ash dieback.â A Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs spokesman said: âPlant health experts are currently looking at potential treatments, but finding resistance to ash dieback is the best hope for the future of ash in the UK.â","Ash dieback was discovered in the UK more than a year ago .

Hundreds of chidldren aged 10 and under have hospitalised suffering from mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol use . Children as young as seven are being admitted to hospital with alcohol problems, an investigation has found. Shocking new figures have revealed dozens of under-10s have been hospitalised suffering from mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol use. A Freedom of Information request to all . of England's 166 NHS hospital trusts revealed a total of 380 children . aged 10 or under were treated for alcohol intoxication between 2008 and . 2012. Worryingly, 67 of the trusts approached either failed or refused to the Freedom of Information request, meaning the figures are likely to be even higher. The most alarming incident was that of an intoxicated seven-year-old boy said to be 'addicted' to alcohol who was treated at a hospital in Sussex. The Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust described his diagnosis as 'alcohol intoxication' and the reason for his attendance as 'alcohol related'. 'The primary diagnosis was a mental and behavioural disorder due to acute intoxication with alcohol,' a report said. For patient confidentiality reasons, the trust would not divulge any other detail except to state he was admitted to hospital in 2008. In another case, a 10-year-old boy was admitted to a hospital in Devon after drinking so much he collapsed. Meanwhile, at least 25 girls and boys aged between seven and ten were taken to hospital in England between 2008 and 2012 to get help for an alcohol-induced disorder. And hundreds more children were rushed to A&E because they were drunk, though not necessarily suffering from an ongoing issue with alcohol. In some of the cases it is likely the alcohol was consumed accidentally, although the data held by hospitals does not always specify this. In one worrying example of child neglect, a two-year-old boy was rushed to a hospital run by Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust last year after accidentally drinking vodka. And in another case, a baby who hadn't even turned one was hospitalised in Gloucestershire after sustaining a head injury while intoxicated with alcohol. One case reported involved a baby who was hospitalised after sustaining a head injury while intoxicated with alcohol (posed by model) The research, by the Ferrari Press Agency, revealed all five of the worst-hit hospital trusts were in the south of England - with the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust topping the list. A total of 46 drunk children aged ten or under were rushed to A&E at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading between 2008 and 2012. Two of these - a nine-year-old girl and a ten-year-old boy - were admitted as in-patients to receive treatment for an alcohol-induced mental and behavioural disorder. Nick Barton, chief executive of the . charity Action on Addiction, said children who suffered from alcohol . problems were likely to have an alcoholic parent. He said: 'Children who grow up in . homes where their parents have alcohol and drug problems are seven times . more likely to develop substance misuse problems themselves. 'A recent study indicated that 22 per cent of children live with a parent who drinks hazardously. 'A particularly worrying finding was the lack of awareness among parents about the effects of their drinking on their children. 'These children are at risk in a . variety of ways, from disruption of family life, social isolation and a . threat to safety as a result of parents' alcohol related behaviour, to . the accessibility of alcohol. Often they assume the parental role.'","380 children aged 10 or under treated for intoxication over four year period .

Pop star: Glitter was yesterday arrested at his home after being accused of sexual offences in connection with the Jimmy Savile scandal . Taken away: The Metropolitan Police swooped yesterday at 7:15am to arrest the 68-year-old pop star, whose real name is Paul Gadd, at his London house . They have refused to discuss who will be next in line for questioning. Comedian Freddie Starr has strenuously denied groping a 14-year-old girl . in Savileâs BBC dressing room but he announced on Friday that he was . prepared to speak to police about it. PR guru Max Clifford claimed dozens of big-name stars from the 1960s and . 70s have contacted him because they fear being implicated in the . widening child abuse scandal. Savile: Police have 400 leads on the predatory paedophile . He said young girls threw themselves at the celebrities but they ânever asked for anybodyâs birth certificateâ. Mr Clifford said: âI think there are a lot of very famous people who are very concerned and very frightened.â Police arrived at former pop star Glitterâs flat in Marylebone, central . London, at 7.15am and arrested him on suspicion of committing sexual . offences. Wearing a bobble hat, thick grey coat, grey trousers, black gloves and . sunglasses, the 68-year-old, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was later . ushered into an unmarked police car. He was questioned at Charing Cross police station for nearly ten hours, . while officers scoured his flat for evidence. They removed several black . sacks. Gadd was released on police bail until mid-December pending further . inquiries. He arrived home in a taxi at 5.15pm and refused to comment. He is the first person to be arrested in relation to Operation Yewtree, the Savile abuse inquiry. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: âOfficers working on Operation Yewtree . have today arrested a man in his 60s in connection with the . investigation. Police leave the home of Gary Glitter in central London after the former pop star was arrested . Arrested: Glitter, born in Banbury, Oxfordshire, had a hugely successful music career in the 1970s . Driven away: Glitter was seen getting into a car outside his home in central London . 'The man, from London, was arrested at approximately . 7.15am on suspicion of sexual offences, and has been taken into custody . at a London police station. The individual falls under the strand of the . investigation we have termed âSavile and othersâ.â Gadd, originally from Banbury, Oxfordshire, was jailed for four months . in 1999 for downloading child porn. Later he was imprisoned in Vietnam . for child-sex offences. Savile, who died last year at the age of 84, is being described as one . of the most prolific sex offenders in UK history. He is thought to have . abused at least 300 victims over four decades, and police are following . more than 400 leads. Jailed: Gary Glitter sits flanked by Vietnamese police in 2006 as he was sentenced to three years in prison for committing obscene acts with two underage girls in Vietnam . Probe: Police are investigating devastating claims that Jimmy Savile, who died last year, sexually abused 300 young people over a 40-year period . Others thought vulnerable to arrest include a former BBC employee who . was a close associate of Savile. The Mail revealed three weeks ago how . he allegedly âprocuredâ girls for the star, and has also been accused of . committing rape himself on BBC premises. A former singer claimed last night that she had a relationship with Savile spanningÂ  almost two decades, and aborted his baby. Donna Foot, 50, of Leatherhead, Surrey, said she met the late Jimâll Fix . It presenter when he flattered her outside BBC studios, but she had no . idea that he was a paedophile. The mother of two said she felt physically sick to rememberÂ  how she had . almost given birth to Savileâs child, and wasÂ  glad she had gone . through with the abortion. Meanwhile, a video has emerged of a moment when Savile groped a petrified teenager on live TV. Sylvia Edwards can be seen sitting next to Savile on Top of the Pops as . he announces the next song to viewers, surrounded by teenage girls. Then a horrified Sylvia leaps off her seat, shrieks and triesÂ  to move . away from smirking Savile, who calmly talks intoÂ  the camera. The presenter grins as he puts his hand up her skirt, tries to grab her . bottom and fondles her as she looks distressedÂ  and attempts to wriggle . free from him. Pop star: Glitter's name was chosen after he worked through the alphabet for an alliterative phrase . Former pop star Gary Glitter is barely recognisable today from the confident star of 1970s glam rock. In his prime, he enjoyed transatlantic success with a string of hits, selling 18 million records in five years in the early 70s. Glitter was born Paul Gadd in Banbury, Oxfordshire, in 1944 and began his search for fame in his teenage years as a singer on the club circuit. His first attempts to break into the charts failed, but when the glam era began his Glitter persona helped him to shoot to stardom. The name was chosen after Gadd worked through the letters of the alphabet looking for an alliterative phrase, having ruled out Terry Tinsel and Stanley Sparkly. His breakthrough hit, Rock and Roll (Parts One and Two), reached the top 10 in both the US and UK and in the following years, as Glitter, he continued to prove popular as he returned the top of the charts. At 5ft 6in, Glitter's stage presence was boosted by the addition of platform heels and big hair. But as the glam era fizzled out, he found himself divorced, bankrupt and struggling with alcohol abuse. In the 1980s and 1990s he enjoyed occasional comebacks and enjoyed a measure of celebrity touring as a student novelty act. In later life, Glitter was reported to have been living in Spain and then Cuba, before moving to South East Asia, where he was jailed for child sex offences in Vietnam in 2006. He returned to the UK in 2008. The 68-year-old now faces further police questions in connection with Scotland Yard's investigation into allegations of sex abuse by Jimmy Savile.

Increase: Almost 1,700 people have been struck down by norovirus - three times as many as this time last year . More than a third of hospitals have been hit by the winter vomiting bug, figures show. Almost 1,700 patients have been struck down by norovirus, three times as many as this time last year. Some hospitals have resorted to banning doctors and nurses from drinking tea on the wards to prevent its spread. And in the worst-hit trust, City Hospitals Sunderland, more than 100 patients have been struck down. The virus â which peaks in the winter months â seems to have arrived far earlier than usual and experts say the NHS has been caught unawares. Earlier this week it also emerged that a number of frontline staff have been infected, putting extra pressure on overstretched wards. According to the latest figures from the Department of Health, a total of 1,695 hospital patients have been struck down. This is three times as many as this time last year when 593 patients had the bug. And 63 out of 158 NHS hospital trusts are affected, with many banning visitors. In City Hospitals . Sunderland NHS a total of 115 patients have norovirus with 1 in 8 of all beds . in the hospital being occupied by someone with the bug. Other badly-hit trusts include City Hospitals in Sunderland (108 cases) and Gateshead Foundation trust (90). Managers at Barking, Havering and Redbridge Trust in Essex have banned staff from having tea and coffee or biscuits on the wards. Dr Ian Hosein, the trustâs director of infection prevention, said: âIt looks like the kick-off has come earlier and it may have taken people slightly unawares. 'What may be happening now is that it kicked in so quickly that people havenât been ready for it. 'Right now the lines are holding, but it is inevitable that hospitals are going to get it. What matters is how quickly they respond.â Banned: Tea and coffee making has been banned on some wards in several NHS trusts . The virus is extremely contagiousÂ  and spreads when it finds its way on to cutlery and food â or peopleâs hands â and is ingested. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhoea, a headache and a temperature. It can be dangerous in the old or in patients with serious underlying conditions and is thought to cause about 80 deaths a year. Earlier this week several NHS trusts including Sheffield Teaching and Warwick confirmed that a number of frontline staff were off with the virus. There is no treatment, but patients are advised to drink plenty of water. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: âThe NHS is well prepared for the increase in winter related health problems which are typical at this time of year. âPreparations are made across the NHS annually and these are now in place in every area of England.â","Almost 1,700 patients have been hit by norovirus - three times as many as this time last year .

It's the dream of anyone who has ever watched TVâs Cash In The Attic: that something among the âjunkâ in their loft might actually be worth a small fortune. But when teacher Jane Cordery tackled her cluttered roof space, her main aim was to clear some space around pipes for a plumber.

As an art teacher in a prep school, with an eye for a well-painted picture, she found herself drawn to its intricate brushwork. Intrigued, she emailed a photograph to Christieâs, whose expert, Brandon Lindberg, immediately spotted its potential. It turned out to be by eminent pre-Raphaelite artist William James Webbe and has been valued at about Â£70,000 by experts at the auction house. âItâs a complete shock â Iâve never won anything beyond the odd thing from a tombola,â said Ms Cordery. It has since been discovered that the painting, which measures 18in by 10in, was exhibited at the Royal Society in 1856, and praised by the leading art critic of the time, John Ruskin, who wrote that it was âa careful study, the brown wing excellentâ.

A piece of glass on display at Swansea University has been identified as a lost fragment of a 3,000-year-old Egyptian vase at Cairo Museum. The fragment is believed to have come from a 15in high vase from the tomb of queen Tiye, the wife of the Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep III, who reigned from 1386 to 1349BC. The piece of glass, which is on loan to the university's Egypt Centre from Swansea Museum, is part of an amphora, a kind of vessel usually used for transporting wine. The rest of the vessel is currently on display in Cairo. The missing fragment of the 3,000-year-old Egyptian vase is currently kept at Swansea University . Although it was found in the tomb of the wife of Amenhotep III, the 4cm fragment bears the name of his grandfather . Amenhotep II, who is thought to have ruled Egypt between 1427-1401BC. and was given to the museum by the family of Harold Jones . in 1959. Mr JonesÂ  was an artist in the tombs of the Valley of the Kings . in the early 20th century. The long piece of glass displays two names of the king picked out in red and yellow on a background of brilliant blue. The names are surmounted by red . sun-disks and yellow feathers. The missing piece was originally . prefabricated separately and then sunk into the body of the 40cm high . glass amphora. The complete vessel consists of a white amphora decorated with brown and light blue decoration. The 3,000-year-old vase, left, is thought to have been sourced by Harold Jones, right, who was an artist in the tombs of the Valley of the Kings in the early 20th century . Dr Carolyn Graves-Brown, Curator of . the Egypt Centre, said: 'Glass of this date is extremely rare in Egypt . and was usually given as diplomatic gifts between the kings of the . region. 'Vessels and other artefacts from the . reign of Amenhotep II are part of an extraordinary array of . sophisticated techniques from an innovative period of glass production. 'Large vessels such as that in Cairo . Museum, from which our fragment originated, were not attempted even in . later years. At this date the manufacture of glass was a royal monopoly . and as valuable as gold and silver.' Royal consort: Ebony, gesso and gold head of Queen Tiye, the wife of Amenhotep III and the mother of Akhenaten. From the Egyptian Museum, Berlin . Amenhotep III's reign is said to mark . the zenith of civilisation in ancient Egypt, for both its cultural . achievement and political power. He is thought to have died around 1354 BC and was buried in a tomb in the secluded western branch of the Valley of the Kings. The Swansea piece which bears his grandfatherâs name . would have been prefabricated and placed upon the body of the vessel . while it was still in a molten state. Interestingly, one of the names for glass in ancient Egyptian was âthe stone that flowsâ. Garethe El-Tawab, Curator of Swansea .

Esther Rantzen has passed emails containing sex allegations against three âhigh-profileâ BBC employees to the police. The messages were sentÂ  to Ms Rantzen by people who saw her appearance on the recent ITV documentary exposing Savile as a predatory paedophile. All three are still alive. Exposed: The e-mails were sent to Esther Rantzen, seen above with Jimmy Savile, following her appearance on a recent ITV documentary exposing the Jim'll Fix It host as a predatory paedophile . Ms Rantzen, the founder of the charity ChildLine, said she passed the âgeneral allegationsâ â which were not made byÂ  the victims but by others with knowledge of the incidents â to detectives on the Savile probe. But she decided not to warn the BBC. âI didnât think it was my responsibility to tell the BBC,â she told The Mail on Sunday yesterday. Earlier this month, MsÂ Rantzen was forced toÂ  deny reports that she ignored warnings about Savile 18 years ago. Esther Rantzen said BBC staff had witnessed Savile's promiscuity . She said yesterday that she had heard a ârumourâ about Savileâs interest in young girls when she started work at the Corporation, but had never met âanyone who had either witnessed it or experienced itâ. However, she said BBC staff had witnessed his promiscuity.

She spoke as it emerged that police have identified three former close associates of Savile crucial to their inquiry and who are expected to be questioned soon. One of them, a convicted sex offender, was a friend of the Top Of The Pops presenter in the early days of his career. The other two were BBC employees in the Seventies. None is a household name.

The photograph of Arredondo, 52, in a cowboy hat, rushing alongside Bauman, 27, and pinching closed a severed artery in one of his shattered legs has become one of the most iconic images of the tragedy encapsulating the day's heroism, suffering and humanity. Now a new image has emerged of the two, it was taken almost exactly a week after the Boston Marathon bombing and shows Arredondo visiting Bauman in his hospital bed at Boston Medical Center on April 22. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Strong bond: Jeff Bauman Jr., left, meets Carlos Arredondo for the first time since the Costa Rican immigrant helped save his life . It shows the emotional face-to-face between Buaman and the man that he credits with saving his life. 'When we first saw each other we . hugged each other and I gave him a kiss on the cheek because it was very . beautiful to see him doing very well,' Arredondo told WHDH. 'He was so happy to see me and he was so thankful. Tears were coming out of his eyes,' he said. Because . of the amount of pain Bauman has been in, their reunion waited a week to allow him extra time toward his recovery. Arrendondo wore a similar tan cowboy hat on his head, one he may be forever be remembered by after that now iconic photograph capturing the day's horrific events.

'When Carlos picked me up and threw me into the wheelchair, then I was like, maybe I am gonna make it,' Bauman previously told WEEI of that desperate moment. 'Before that, no way. I thought I was done.' The two men have now meet several times at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston  since that awful April afternoon. A strong bond has grown between them, with Arredondo saying Bauman is helping him to come to terms with what he saw that day. âIt's constantly in my head, seeing . the people,â Arredondo told the Wall Street Journal. âI'm at the spot of . the event, seeing the young man I helped, and the young lady who died . ...

Pain and suffering are nothing new to the Costa Rican immigrant. The 52-year-old's eldest son, 20-year-old  Lance Corporal Alexander Arredondo of the U.S. Marine Corps died in action nine years ago.

Arredondo has described how, as most . people ran for their lives when the explosions went off in Boston, he . vaulted a fence to get to spectators, many of whom had lost limbs, and . used his clothes and towels to stanch victims' bleeding. 'I jumped the fence after the first . explosions and all I saw was a puddle of blood and people with lost . limbs,' he told ABC News. 'I saw adults, much younger than myself -- . ladies, men, pretty much everyone was knocked out.' Mr Arredondo helped .

A graphic photograph shows the hero seemingly pinching shut the femoral artery on one of Mr Bauman's part-severed legs using his hand as they rush him to ambulances.

Lying deep beneath the streets of London, hidden in the secret vaults of the Bank of England, is 4,600 tonnes of 'forgotten gold'. Worth Â£197billion pounds, the rows of gold bullions - which are kept in a closely guarded location -Â  are rarely seen by outsiders. But the Bank's precious metal reserves - each shelf worth Â£35million each - have been filmed by the University of Nottingham for a new series about elements called The Periodic Table of Videos. Scroll down for video . Bullion worth billions: Professor Martyn Poliakoff from the University of Nottingham gives a guided tour of gold bars worth Â£197 billion in the Bank of England vaults . The Bank of England has given permission for the nation's gold bullion reserve of Â£197billion to be filmed by university professor Martyn Poliakoff . Each shelf of the precious metal, displayed like 'bars of chocolate in a sweet shop' weighs a ton and is worth Â£35million . Chemistry Professor Martyn Poliakoff, obtained special permission to visit the high security vault, accompanied by video journalist Brady Haran. Given coveted access he reveals the incredible sight of row upon row of the gold bars displayed like 'chocolates in the duty free at the airport' He says: 'I've never seen so much gold. In fact, I've never seen so much of any element.' The Prof sad he and his film team had to go through a host of security checks to access the vault. All cash must be left as the door, because no one is allowed to bring money into the vault. He said: 'One's first reaction is that it can't be real because normally you don't see such things. It looks like chocolates in the duty free at the airport. 'But these really are solid gold bars and it is extraordinary. There isn't any smell because metals don't smell and it's very quiet because of the thick walls to keep it secure. 'It's been very cold recently and I was ready to be shivering but it's nice and warm but I suppose gold colour gives you a feeling of warmth so it maybe partly psychological.' Although Britain owns around 310 tones of gold 'other organisations' use the secure vaultÂ  to store their bullion. Prof Poliakoff was allowed to film the vault for the university as part of a series about elements called The Periodic Table of Videos . If all the gold in the world was gathered in one space it would fill the size of just one large house . Even when bars are sold, they are not removed from the cavernous space. Instead, each bar has its own number and that is simply transferred to the ownership of the buyer. The oldest bar in the vault has been there since 1916. He added: 'The beauty of gold is that it is very inactive. It looks just the same now as it did in 1916. It hasn't tarnished, it hasn't got oxide layers on the surface.' The bank allowed him to show off two individual bars, one originally from Australia and one from Switzerland each weighing round 28 lbs and worth about Â£435,000 each. The academic has estimated if all the gold ever mined was made into bricks it would end up in a block 20 metres cubed or around 60ft wide, high and deep. This means if all the gold in the world was gathered in one space it would fill the size of justÂ  one large house. But as he stands between the piles of 28lb 24-carat gold bullion, Prof Poliakoff confesses he is slightly disappointed by the scene. 'Gold is an exciting element, it has interesting chemistry and it's just sitting here doing nothing' 'It's enormously impressive but it's a bit sad, rather like a mausoleum where the dead gold is sitting waiting for people to remember it.' 'It should be doing exciting reactions,' he adds.","Cavern hidden deep under London holds gold haul weighing 4,600 tonnes .

Sir Roger Jones OBE, former chairman of Children in Need, who has said that predatory paedophile Jimmy Savile was banned because of his suspicious behaviour with children . Jimmy Savile was secretly banned from the BBCâs Children in Need appeal for being âcreepyâ. Though still revered elsewhere at the corporation, the presenter was kept away from the annual fundraiser because of ârumoursâ of his interest in young girls. Sir Roger Jones, the former chairman of Children in Need, said: âWe all recognised he was a creepy sort of character. We took the decision that we didnât want him near the charity.â Savile raised millions for good causes, so the revelation that he was barred from the BBCâs own flagship appeal suggests his unsavoury lifestyle was widely known. Sir Roger, 69, who was a governor of BBC Wales at the time, said: âA guy with a big cigar in his mouth, a string vest who is covered in gold chains and trinkets â is this really the guy we want to become a hero for kids? âI had no evidence but I found his behaviour very strange. I felt it was inappropriate. I couldnât tell that he was a practising paedophile â but I didnât have to. âA charity like Children In Need knew the biggest thing to guard against was paedophiles â they were just like flies around theÂ  honey pot.â Savile appeared on the telethon in 1984, 1987 and 1989, before Sir Roger became chairman. A member of the board of governors between 1996 and 2002, Sir Roger said he would have stepped down from his charity role if Savile had become involved. He added: âOn my watch, Children in Need was properly covered. There were no incidents. We did everything we could to protect the children. âNot just in the fundraising but also in the distribution of funds.

He said: 'We didn't want him near the charity' Pete Saunders, chief executive of the charity, said: âI will be writing to the director-general George Entwistle next week, asking the BBC to help survivors of abuse because I think they owe it to them.â Since dying aged 84 a year ago yesterday, Savile has been exposed as one of the countryâs worst ever predatory paedophiles. His great-niece â who revealed her grandmother knew he had abused her but said nothing â has been attacked on Facebook for speaking out about the TV star molesting her. Caroline Robinson, 49, of Thoralby, North Yorkshire, became a target for relatives after claiming her late grandmother, Savileâs sister Marjorie Marsden, kept quiet to âpreserve his fameâ. She claimed to have been molested twice by the age of 15 â but after talking publicly she has been accused of lying and bringing shame on her family, which has led her to report relatives to police. Yesterday Savileâs official biographer declared herself âutterly devastatedâ by his betrayal. Alison Bellamy, who wrote Howâs About That, Then? said Savile has gone from âchildhood hero to monsterâ, adding: âThinking back, he littered his words with phrases that I now see in a new light. I would laugh when he would say, unprompted, things like: âShe said she was over 16, boss, honest.â âMaybe he felt guilty? Maybe he didnât.â Ã· A former royal aide has told how Savile would run his lips up the arms of young female assistants while visiting St Jamesâs Palace. Dickie Arbiter, spokesman for the Queen for more than a decade, said the DJ exhibited behaviour that was a cause for âconcernâ during regular visits to see Prince Charles. âI remember calling him an old reprobate and he said ânot so much of the oldâ,â said Mr Arbiter. Listen to the interview here . Individual allegations were not collated, says Mr Hogan-Howe . Abuse allegations made against Jimmy Savile while he was alive could have been linked to show 'a pattern of behaviour', Scotland Yard's commissioner said today. Bernard Hogan-Howe said police and other organisations had not 'put together' claims made against the disgraced television presenter. Members of the public may also have been discouraged from taking action because of Savile's reputation at the time, he said. The commissioner told reporters: 'You might have thought that people would at least have talked about it and intervened. 'It does look as if from time to time people have been concerned, they've made the start to intervene, but probably then they've relied a little bit too much on his reputation and his word that he did nothing. 'If you accept all the public accounts of the activity then it's possibly spanned 50 years which is a huge amount of time. 'First of all within an organisation that's got everybody's respect, but probably it appears that people haven't intervened when they've had suspicions. 'Then of course other organisations including the police have had individual allegations that have not been put together to actually show that this person may well have shown a pattern of behaviour that's been pretty awful.' Four police forces were contacted by seven potential victims while Savile was alive. Surrey, Sussex and Jersey all found that there was not enough evidence to proceed. Mr Hogan-Howe said a lot of what happened was before changes were made to the sharing of police data following the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. A team of 30 officers are currently investigating three categories of allegations: those involving Savile, those involving Savile and others, and those involving others. The commissioner said that most of the 'others' are involved in the entertainment industry.","Disgraced TV presenter was not allowed 'anywhere near the charity'

Former Highland Councillor Drew McFarlane-Slack, who lives in neighbouring Ballachulish, told The Sun: 'I deplore any kind of actions like that. 'But when people have said things have happened in that house, it doesn't make it understandable, but people will take action when they are so angry.

Anger: Witnesses saw three men in their 20s throwing stones at the house and spray-painting the walls . BBC Scotland reporter Andreas Wolff . said he had been told that witnesses saw three men in their 20s throwing . stones at the house and spray-painting the walls. He said a black car was seen in front of the house with the doors wide open. Last week officers searched the cottage to look for 'any evidence of any others being involved in any offending with him.' Frozen . in time, his hairbrush, documents, ashtray and even his food were . scattered around the empty home just as he left them. Other rooms in the cottage, where he once entertained Prince Charles over dinner, contained bunk beds and a double bed all made up neatly with fresh bed linen. Officers believe Savile's cottage, called Alt-na-reigh, could hold vital clues that could help theÂ  investigation. Search: Savile's former Highland home has been raided by police because it is believed he may have abused more than 20 there . Time capsule: All rooms in the cottage, including the living area containing Savile's chair and table, had been untouched since his death last year . Famously Savile had the Prince of Wales around for dinner in 1999 and hired three waitresses in aprons with HRH sewn into them. The Northern Constabulary, which led the raid, said they were helping the Met with their probe, while Scotland Yard said they would not comment on the ongoing investigation. Savile maintained it was his dream to . live in the Highlands and he spent huge sums converting the home, adding . glass walls, mains water and sewage as well as modernising its decor . throughout. Through the window: This picture shows a set of bunk beds in a bedroom in the cottage where more than 20 people may have been abused . Untouched: The cottage remains as it was when Savile died, and includes matches, hairbrush, ashtray, pens and even a biscuit belonging to the DJ .

Front door: The property's entrance is shown in the background with several strong locks and a latch with the kitchen sink and worktops in the foreground . View: With the Highlands through Savile's back door this photo shows his possessions and wood burning stove . Because the cottage remains untouched since his death, it is stacked full of photos, clothes and documents, which could lead to identifying more victims or help those who have already made allegations of abuse. Savile bought the Glencoe property, which is a mile from the nearest house, in 1998 and used it as a hideaway up until his death. He bought it after falling in love with the area on a cycling holiday in 1944. Eerie: Savile's chair, a dented bin and some of his possessions strewn about the room . Sign: The property was about to be sold this year but was kept by the Savile trust who wanted to make it into a retreat for the disabled . He became a regular in Glencoe village, with residents saying he was an 'attention seeker' who would wander around in a Highland kilt waving at passing tourists. One man from the area described how he had asked for the DJ's autograph and instead got a bizarre message from him that read 'lost girls' should visit him. The cottage was to be sold this year for Â£300,000 but this was halted by his charitable trust, who wanted to convert it into a respite centre for the disabled. Famous visitors: Dressed in full Highland regalia, Sir Jimmy Savile with the Prince of Wales in Glencoe for a 1999 visit followed by dinner at the DJ's home . Errand: The pair also headed for the local post office to meet the locals . Reputation: Savile was known to show off when in Glencoe, especially to tourists, pictured here serving tea to American honeymoon couple Brian and Rebekah Morovitz at a Highland restaurant . But this is now in doubt after it announced it is to close down. Trustees had hoped the property - one of only two in the Glencoe gorge - could be used by mountaineering groups. But the Mountaineering Council of Scotland said it had had no further contact since before the scandal broke. VIDEO: Jimmy denies allegations six years ago at an interview in his Highland home... The official biographer for Jimmy Savile says she is 'utterly devastated' by his betrayal. Alison Bellamy first met Savile in the late 1990s through his charity work while she was a reporter for a local newspaper in his hometown of Leeds, West Yorkshire. She went on to write his authorised biography, âHowâs About That, Thenâ. But since the shocking revelations in recent weeks, Alison has revealed that she still cannot believe that Savile has gone from 'childhood hero to monster', adding: 'To find out he was not what I thought he was is utterly devastating.' Describing the first time she went to his house, Alison wrote in Savileâs autobiography that she questioned whether she would be safe with him 'despite the rumours'. She said: 'As a news reporter in his home city... I had heard the sly comments and whisperings about his fondness for young girls.' When she confronted him about the rumours, he 'laughed them off', reacting 'as expected with a well-rehearsed speech: ""It goes with the territory"".' 'He was dismissive, as if what I was saying was ridiculous,' she said. 'He went on to tell me an anecdote about how he had been to give music lessons in a Leeds junior school and, some time later, two little girls aged about 11, knocked on the door of his flat and he let them in, gave them a cup of tea and sent them home. 'He said: ""It was the stupidest thing I ever did as one of their dads came round threatening to kill me"".' And Alison has her own memories of encounters which now seem chilling. 'I wonder, when he used to sit quietly at the back of St Anneâs Catholic Cathedral, what he thought about. Did he pray?' She added that at first she could not believe the rumours, saying: 'The predatory, child-abusing Savile the world has heard so much about for the last few weeks, was not the man we thought we knew so well. 'But after hearing stories from women first hand, I now have to accept the terrible truth.' It has also been revealed the owner of a conference centre in Leeds has spent Â£50,000 pounds ridding the venue of Savileâs name after it was changed from Savileâs Hall to New Dock Hall.","The remote white-washed property is thought to be where the disgraced TV presenter may have abused dozens of children over the decades .

Muslims and other ethnic minorities living in Britain should embrace our way of life and celebrate Christmas in traditional style, with carols and Santa, accordingÂ  to a Cabinet Minister. Baroness Warsi, Minister for Faith and Communities, says immigrant families must do more to become fully integrated and wants to introduce measures to force them to speak English. She also says it is wrong to excuse drug-taking by ethnic minorities through fear of being branded racist. Controversial: Faith and Communities Minister Baroness Warsi says immigrant families must do more to embrace the British way of life . And, most controversially, she says immigrant families should enjoy a traditional Christian Christmas, complete with Nativity plays and Christmas cards. Baroness Warsi, a practising Muslim, told The Mail on Sunday it was time to tackle âpolitically correctâ attitudes. She said that if immigrant families were given more help to learn English and told in blunt terms ânow, join inâ, it would improve race relations and unlock the estimated Â£8âbillion earning potentialÂ  of talented, non-English-speaking ethnic minorities. Baroness Warsi said English people were partly to blame due to their âwatering downâ of traditions such as Christmas, for example by replacing âMerry Christmasâ on cards with the non-religious âSeasonâs greetingsâ. She said if English people showed more self-confidence, immigrant families would copy them. She added: âThe numberÂ  of Asians who wear kilts at their wedding in Scotland is amazing. 'Because the Scottish identity is much more assertive than the weaker English identity, minority communities are more embracing of it.â Integration: Baroness Warsi said immigrant families should enjoy a traditional Christian Christmas - from carols to nativity plays . The peer, who is to makeÂ  a speech on integration tomorrow, said the use of teaching assistants who act as translators in classrooms was âholding children backâ. Similarly, multi-lingual forms in hospitals and other public services should be phased out, Baroness Warsi said. She also urged Home Secretary Theresa May to ban khat, a legal plant-based drug blamed for causing criminal behaviour. Baroness Warsi, who is also a Foreign Office Minister, claimed the reasonÂ  it had not been outlawed was because it was used mainly by Somalis and Ethiopians.","Baroness Warsi said ethnic minorities living in Britain should embrace carols, nativity plays and Santa .

These pictures show the chilling moment a sexual predator posed as a 'Good Samaritan' to help a drunken woman before taking her home and raping her. Ebrima Dampha, 33, was caught on CCTV as he pounced on his vulnerable victim when she passed out in a bar at four times the drink drive limit. The woman, who is in her thirties, was barely able to walk or talk as Dampha, a chef from Havant in Hampshire, dragged her outside to a taxi, intent on raping her. Vulnerable: The victim is led to a taxi by Dampha, who pretended to help the woman but took her back to her home and raped her . He rifled through her handbag to find her address in the car and even acted as her saviour on their journey back to her house, a court heard. But when they arrived he took money from her purse to pay the fare, waved the cab away and led her upstairs to attack her in her own house. There, he raped her as she lay unconscious and 'completely helpless'. The victim - who cannot be named for legal reasons - had gone out for a meal with a friend 'for a good old catch up.' They went on to the Roast Bar in Portsmouth, Hampshire, where she was targeted by Dampha, a father-of-three with a history of domestic violence. When she woke up the morning after the assault, Dampha had gone and she realised she had been raped. Sexual predator: Dampha, 33, was jailed for eight years for rape at Portsmouth Crown Court . However, she had no recollection of where she had been. A small red 'R' stamped on her hand told police she had visited the Roast Bar and they were able to retrieve CCTV recordings from the venue. It showed Dampha leading his victim outside and into a taxi at 2.45am. He was arrested and admitted having sex with the woman but insisted it was consensual. However, a jury at Portsmouth Crown Court rejected his version of events and convicted him of rape. His victim today spoke of her ordeal after Dampha was jailed for eight years. The woman, from Portsmouth, said: 'I have been through hell because I still donât exactly know what happened. Iâve got no recollection. 'My friend and I hadnât planned to stay out that late and were having a good old catch up. 'What happened that night is always going to be with me and I donât know how to move on. 'But I do have an overwhelming sense of relief that people did believe what had happened. 'If you go out and youâre a bit drunk it doesnât give someone the right to take advantage of you. 'Some people say if youâre drunk youâre asking for it but youâre not.' Before the trial, the victim would wake up every night - at the same time she was attacked. She gave her evidence from behind a screen, at times breaking down in tears. To this day, she has not come face-to-face with her attacker again. She said: 'Seeing him again would be too traumatic. I went to court just to stop this from happening to someone else. 'If I hadnât reported it and later found out he had done it to someone else I donât know how I would have felt.' She added: 'I donât go out like I used to. I just go to friendsâ houses now. 'I donât think I will ever go to that area of town again because seeing the Roast Bar would freak me out. 'It comes down to being sensible about what youâre drinking, although sometimes you donât feel it and it hits you at once. 'If youâre out with friends and one suddenly appears quite drunk, look after them and make sure they get home safely. Look after each other.' 'Ebrima Dampha is a sexual predator. He carried out a premeditated attack on a helpless female victim in her own home. This case highlights the dangers of drinking alcohol to excess and his sentence sends a clear message to anyone who preys upon vulnerable and defenceless victims' Detective Constable Chris Dinenage . Judge Roger Hetherington told Dampha as he jailed him for eight years: 'You would have realised, I have no doubt, that she was very drunk. 'That would have been confirmed when you came across her passed out on the floor. 'From that moment onwards you saw the possibility of an opportunity for some sexual gratification. 'She was incoherent, barely able to stand up and in no position to look after herself. 'The aggravating features of this rape are the breach of trust - because you were acting in a role of someone looking after her - that she was assaulted in her own home, and the element of targeting of a hopelessly drunk woman. 'You went into her house on the pretext of looking after her. 'Instead you took her upstairs and raped her in circumstances where she was completely helpless.'

Punishment: A 15-year-old girl, who was allegedly sexually abused by her stepfather for years, has been sentenced to 100 lashes in the Maldives for having pre-marital sex . Her stepfather, who had reportedly been abusing the girl for years, is reportedly facing 25 years in prison for the rape and allegedly killing a baby conceived from it. He has been charged with sexually abusing a minor, possessing pornography, and murder, while her mother has been charged with concealing a crime and murder. The girl later admitted to police that she had had consensual sex with another man.It is not known whether he will face charges. Court officials have said the flogging, will be carried out once the girl turns 18. Until that time she will be under house arrest.

'Flogging is a violation of the absolute prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. 'The Maldivian authorities should immediately end its use regardless of circumstances.

A judge's decision to dismiss a harassment charge against a Muslim accused of attacking a man marching as 'Zombie Muhammad' during a Halloween parade last year was today branded 'completely and unequivocally unacceptable'. Ernest Perce was marching through Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, with a fellow atheist dressed as a 'Zombie Pope' when he was confronted by Talaag Elbayomy, 46, about his 'offensive' costume. Perce claims Elbayomy then choked him from behind and tried to remove a sign that read 'Muhammad of Islam' from around his neck. Scroll down for video . Halloween parade: Ernest Perce (right) marches through Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, with a fellow atheist dressed as a 'Zombie Pope' in October. He was confronted by Talaag Elbayomy about his 'offensive' costume, which included the sign 'Muhammad of Islam', here invisible so added by Perce electronically . Elbayomy was charged with harassment after Perce reported the 'attack' to a nearby police officer. Elbayomy in turn filed his own complaint with police accusing Perce of instigating the incident and claiming he never laid a hand on him. He admitted arguing with Perce about his costume. When the case came to court in December, Cumberland County Magisterial District Judge Mark Martin - an Iraq War veteran and a recent Islam convert - said there wasn't enough evidence to convict Elbayomy of harassment as it was one man's word against the other's. A video of the incident taken from Perce's point of view, and now posted on YouTube, could not be taken into account because it was ruled inconclusive. In an audio recording of his ruling released by Perce this week, Judge Martin said: 'I think our forefathers intended that we use the First Amendment so that we could speak what's on our mind, not to p*** off other people and cultures, which is what you did. 'You are way outside your bounds of First Amendment rights. 'You've completely trashed their essence, their being. I'm a Muslim. I find it offensive.' Criticised: Judge Mark Martin (centre), a former Iraq War veteran and recent Islam convert, has been accused of showing a 'preferential opinion of Islam over Christianity' The judge added: 'When we go to other countries it's not uncommon for people to refer to us as ugly Americans. 'This is why we are referred to as ugly Americans, because we are so concerned about our own rights we don't care about other people's rights as long as we get our say but we don't care about the other people's say.' The decision has outraged freedom of speech campaigners and legal experts. The American Atheists organisation criticised the decision as 'completely and unequivocally unacceptable'. It posted on its blog: 'That a Muslim immigrant can assault a United States citizen in defence of his religious beliefs and walk away a free man, while the victim is chastised and insulted by a Muslim judge who then blamed the victim for the crime committed against him is a horrible abrogation. 'I can promise you this, you have not heard the last of this issue. Not by a long shot.' Failed legal bid: Perce is also angry that the judge 'railed on me for six minutes about how bad I was offending Islam' Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, questioned whether Judge Martin was letting his personal views get in the way of the U.S. legal process. Writing on his blog, he said: 'I can understand the judgeâs claims of conflicting testimony on the crime... However, I view this as an extremely troubling case that raises serious questions of judicial temperament, if not misconduct.' Perce said Judge Mark Martin showed a 'preferential opinion of Islam over Christianity' when in court. He is also angry that the judge 'railed on me for six minutes about how bad I was offending Islam'. Perce said the judge gave him permission to record the courtroom proceedings, although he was also warned that releasing the audio could result in him being charged with contempt of court.

The 87-year-old former prime minister is expected to spend Christmas there after being operated on three days ago to remove a growth from her bladder after suffering pain earlier in the week. Following the operation, she was said to be 'in good spirits', and a spokeswoman this afternoon said there had been no change in her condition. She is not expected to be released from hospital for a few days. Baroness Thatcher, 87, was moved to a London hospital last week after suffering from pains in her abdomen. She is said to be 'in good spirits' but is not expected to be released for a few days. Pictured above with daughter Carol . Britainâs first female prime minister has her daughter Carol, 59, at her side. PR . guru Tim Bell, who helped mastermind her three general election . victories, said yesterday: âThe operation was a success and she is . recovering.â Another Tory source said: âI have heard absolutely nothing to suggest that there is any reason to be concerned. She will be in hospital for several days but she has Carol with her.â Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted her âa speedy recoveryâ at the weekend. Surgeons used a âminimally invasiveâ procedure to remove a growth from her bladder on Friday evening. Friends said that doctors will want to examine the material that was removed during the operation but that there would be no further news for several days. One ally dismissed claims yesterday that she might have cancer as âpure speculationâ. Sources close to the family said she was doing well .

Her health was thrust into the global spotlight this year with the release of a Hollywood film about her with Meryl Streep in the lead role. The Iron Lady drew criticism from David Cameron and others for concentrating on the dementia she has suffered. Miss Streep won an Oscar for the role. Lady Thatcher was not well enough to join the Queen for a lunch with former and serving prime ministers as part of the Diamond Jubilee this summer. And two years ago she missed an 85th birthday party thrown in her honour by Mr Cameron at 10 Downing Street. In October she was sufficiently well, however, to mark her 87th birthday with lunch at a restaurant in Londonâs St Jamesâs district with her son Mark, also 59, and his wife. She also attended the 50th birthday party of former defence secretary Liam Fox, the modern politician to whom she is closest.","Former PM was moved to a London hospital last week after suffering abdominal pains .

Wearing nothing but the skimpiest of swimming trunks and a microphone, Bikram Choudhury won a legion of celebrity acolytes with his brand of âhot yogaâ, which sees devotees exercise in temperatures up to 40C (104F). Now, according to allegations by one of Choudhuryâs young protegees, it seems all that heat might have gone to his head. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Sarah Baughn is suing Bikram Choudhury, whose yoga regime has become a global phenomenon . Sarah Baughn has accused him of sexually assaulting and harassing her, then sabotaging her career when she rebuffed him. In a lawsuit filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court, Miss Baughn, 29, says Choudhury, whose devotees include Madonna and Pippa Middleton, pressed his body against hers and whispered sexual comments. The 67-year-old also supposedly told her that his wife Rajashree was a âbitchâ and that she had to save him from her. Claims: The founder of Bikram yoga, Bikram Choudhury, has been accused of sexual harassment and discrimination by one of his students .

A woman whose life was changed forever after a 'love doctor' mutilated her genitals is writing a book about her ordeal and the doctor she trusted to perform the routine procedure. Cheryl Sexton Dillon, from Ohio, was happily married with three children when she was 36-years-old.Â  But her happiness was ruined when Dr James C. Burt recommended she get a hysterectomy when all she needed was minor bladder surgery. What followed was not just a hysterectomy, but a nine-hour operation in which her genitalia was totally mutilated - with her vagina relocated and her clitoral hood removed. Speaking to ABC about the 1984 procedure, she said: 'I thought I would die. The pain was unlike anything I had ever experienced in places I couldn't understand. Trauma: Cheryl Dillon did not just get a hysterectomy, but a nine-hour operation in which her genitalia was totally mutilated - with her vagina relocated and her clitoral hood remove . 'When I went to Dr Burt and asked, ""What have you done?"" he said, ""What are you talking about?"" I found out from other doctors that I had been mutilated.' One doctor said her genitals looked like 'a fileted fish'. Ordinary activities were impossible like sitting down and wearing pants. Having sex with her husband was excruciatingly painful and because of it, her 12-year marriage fell apart. Dr Burt was a respected ob/gyn at St Elizabeth's Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, and an advocate of redesigning women's genitalia to improve their sex life. He even wrote a book about it in 1975 called Surgery of Love, the proponent of which was: 'Women are structurally inadequate for intercourse. This is a pathological condition amenable to surgery.' He performed countless operations on women, leaving most of them horribly disfigured, for almost 20 years until he surrendered his medical license in 1989 following a barrage of complaints and lawsuits. In 1988, the Ohio Medical Board cited Burt for alleged 'experimental and medical unnecessary surgical procedures, in some incidents without proper patient consent', as many women believed they were going through routine procedures like post-pregnancy repairs and hysterectomies. St Elizabeth's Hospital began requiring Burt to use a 'a special consent form specific to love surgery' in 1979, according toÂ ABC News. He himself admitted he did not always get proper consent for some of his earliest surgeries. Dr Burt is now 91-years-old and bankrupt. He declined to comment on the article. The surgeon she trusted: Dr James C. Burt was an eccentric but respected ob/gyn at St Elizabeth's Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, and was a proponent of procedures to redesign women's genitalia . His sonÂ  James C. Burt III, 68, of Los Angeles, defended his father's medical practices to ABC: 'There are hundreds and hundreds of Dr Burt's patients, alive today, whose marriages and lives were dramatically improved by his wholesome restoration to their fully functioning sexual responsiveness, which most of those patients had previously enjoyed earlier in their marriages. 'Until there are those in the media or the medical profession who are willing to look at the successful results, which fully benefited the lives of countless numbers of his patients, there should and will be no further comment on behalf of Dr Burt or his family.' Dillon eventually settled out of court with St Elizabeth's Hospital. She was one of the first to file a malpractice lawsuit against them and Burt in 1985. She is now writing a book about her experience. When the now-65-year-old first went to Burt, Dillon was already in a happy second marriage with three children. He told her, 'You don't really need to have more kids'. 'I went ahead and got a hysterectomy,' Dillon said. 'You trust your doctor'. After weeks of constant pain, she went to see another doctor for a second opinion. She explains: I asked for the best doctor, because I had to find out what was wrong with me. He looked at me and called in one of the nurses and said, ""Have you ever seen anything like this?"" 'He had repositioned my vagina and circumcised me. The doctor said he had never seen it anywhere except in African tribes. 'The way I was deformed, I couldn't have sex. I ended up going through three different corrective surgeries but by that time, my marriage was shot and I lost the best thing that had happened in my life.' When she went public with her story a number of other women came forward with similar stories. Several other women filed malpractice lawsuits against Burt, but according to the New York Times, many of the cases were dropped because doctors would not testify. Dillon has moved back to Ohio to care for her elderly parents who both have Alzheimer's. Though she says she still lives with the effects of what happened: 'My life has taken a lot of different turns and ups and downs. So much of it happened because of that part of my life.'","Cheryl Sexton Dillon was 36 when Dr James Burt performed what was supposed to be a hysterectomy .

Police have arrested a second suspect in the rape of a five-year-old girl in India, who officers say was left for dead in a locked room. Pradeep Kumar, a 19-year-old clothes factory worker, was arrested today in the eastern state of Bihar, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from New Delhi. New Delhi police said he was now being brought to the capital. Police said questioning of the first man arrested in the case on Saturday, Manoj Kumar, led them to the second suspect. Pradeep Kumar (left) was arrested today as a suspectÂ  in the rape of a five year old girl. Manoj Kumar, 24, (right) was arrested in Saturday . Manoj Kumar, 24, was arrested on Saturday in Bihar and flown back to New Delhi. Kumar is a common last name in India and the two men are not related. The men are accused of abducting, raping and attempting to murder the five-year-old, who went missing April 15 and was found two days later by neighbours who heard her crying in a locked room in the same New Delhi building where she lives with her family. The girl was alone when she was found, having been left for dead by her attackers, police said. The girl was in critical condition when she was transferred on Thursday from a local hospital to the largest government-run hospital in the country. D.K. Sharma, medical superintendent of the hospital in New Delhi where the girl was being treated, said she was responding well to treatment and that her condition had stabilised. 'She is much better today and her wounds are healing well,' Sharma told reporters. It coincides with angry protests . across the capital, where demonstrators clashed with police as anger . grows over how authorities handle such cases. The attack came four months after the fatal gang rape of a woman on a New Delhi bus sparked outrage across India about the treatment of women in the country.

Indian police officials escort Pradeep Kumar (centre, in blue) at the regional airport in Patna today, to board a flight for New Delhi . For the third consecutive day, sporadic protests erupted in at least three places in New Delhi. Scores of supporters of the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party dodged a huge police cordon and managed to reach the gates of Parliament where they shouted slogans against the Delhi police's handling of the case. About 100 BJP supporters were detained. Police said they would be held at a nearby police station and then released in a few hours. Anger: Women clash with police outside the home of Congress Party chief Sonia Gandhi today . Discontent: Many women are angry at the Indian authorities over the handling of sexual assault cases . Shocking: Today's demonstrations in New Delhi follow the kidnap, rape and torture of a five-year-old girl . Separately, about 100 women protested . at another area near the Parliament building. Most of the protests were . directed against the Delhi police officers who failed to act after the . girl's parents told them she was missing. The . protesters have demanded that the Delhi police chief be removed from . office and that police accused of failing to act on the parents' complaint be dismissed. 'The . police must be held accountable for their shocking levels of apathy. They urgently need to review police processes to ensure that all cases . of rape and sexual violence - not just those highlighted by the media - . are fully and promptly investigated,' said G. Ananthapadmanabhan, who . heads the India chapter of the human rights group Amnesty International. Clashes: Two men are detained by police amid today's fierce protests in the country's capital city . Unrest: Officers say they detained around 50 people but that they were all released a few hours later . Mishandling: Police are accused of ignore the complaints from the parents of India's latest rape victim . 'Those who fail to do their job must be held accountable,' he said. Delhi police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar today admitted police had made mistakes in the handling the case. 'There have been shortfalls, so the station house officer and his deputy have been suspended,' Kumar told reporters. However, . he said that instructions given to police officers since the December . gang rape case to report all complaints of rape and molestation had led . to a 'phenomenal rise' in the number of such cases registered in the . city. 'This shows that . the tendency earlier to dissuade women from getting their complaints . registered has changed dramatically,' he said. Revealed: India's opposition leader revealed another rape victim, also five, has been abandoned by her parents . Calls for change: There have been a number of high-profiled cases of sexual abuse in India . Demands: Protesters were demanding the government ensure the safety and women and girls in the capital . He said the number of rape and molestation cases that police were able to solve and make arrests had also gone up drastically. Despite . the police chief's claims of tighter enforcement, sexual crimes against . women and children are reported every day in Indian newspapers, and . women often complain about feeling insecure when they leave their homes. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called for changes in attitudes toward women in India. 'The . gruesome assault on the little girl a few days back reminds us once . again of the need to work collectively to root out this sort of . depravity from our society,' Singh said at a meeting on Sunday with . civil servants. The . December gang rape on the New Delhi bus sparked outrage and spurred the . government to pass tough laws for crimes against women, including the . death penalty for repeat offenders or for rape attacks that lead to the . victim's death.

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 15:16 EST, 2 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:47 EST, 2 May 2013 . The trail of photos left online by the friends of the Boston Marathon bomber shows that they went on a trip from Massachusetts to New York City in recent months. There is an eerie shadow over the photos as it was revealed that suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his now-dead brother Tamerlan were plotting to continue their terror streak in Manhattan after killing three and injuring more than 200 in the marathon bombing. Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, both Kazakh nationals, and an American friend Robel Phillipos were all arrest on Wednesday for various charges relating to helping their friend 'Jahar' cover up his tracks after the bombing. Blocks away: Azamat Tazhayakov posted this picture of himself in front of The New York Times headquarters, just blocks from Times Square, on his profile for a Russian social media site . Seeing the sights: Tazhayakov is seen posing in front of the Statue of Liberty with two unidentified friends during the same trip to New York . Boys trip: Azamat Tazhayakov (left) and Dias Kadyrbayev (center) pose with suspected bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) in the middle of Times Square in Manhattan during a trip thought to have taken place in April 2012 . Kadyrbayev, 19, and Tazhayakov, 20, have profiles on Russian social media site VKontakte that show pictures of themselves touring Manhattan, though it does not appear that Phillipos was on the trip. At one point during the trip, which appears to have taken place in April 2012, the group stopped to take the typical tourist shot in front of the Statue of Liberty. Another stop on their tour was Times Square, where five young men- including Tsarnaev, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov- posed happily. Different view: Because the charges against the friends, including Tazhayakov on the left, focus on their involvement after the bombings, it does not imply that they had any prior knowledge about the attack- or the Tsarnaev's plot to drive down to Manhattan on the same day and continue their attack . No red flags: Tazahayakov's social media profile does not seem unlike that of many other college-age boys . Tazhayakov also had his picture taken outside of the office of The New York Times, just blocks away from Times Square. The bustling New York tourist attraction clearly stuck with Tsarnaev, as he and his brother reportedly considered it as a second bombing location. Following Tamerlan's death during an altercation with police and Dzhokar's arrest, the FBI reported that the pair initially planned on driving the BMW that they hijacked and driving it to New York from Boston but were thwarted by a lack of gas. Enjoying life: Azamat Tazhayakov posted pictures of himself smoking a hookah pipe (left) and relaxing . Pals: Kadyrbayev (center) and Tazhayakov (right) lived together in an apartment off of the UMASS-Dartmouth campus in New Bedford, though it is unclear where this picture was taken . Connection: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is seen here with Dias Kadyrbayev, and the two reportedly joked about him being the Boston Marathon bomber via text in the days after the attack . Joking: Kadyrbayev, seen with two different friends, told investigators that he thought Tsarnaev was playing around when he sent texts brushing off similarities between himself and the suspected bomber . 'Questioning of Dzhokhar revealed that he and his brother decided spontaneously on Times Square as a target,' New York police commissioner Ray Kelly said a news conference with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. 'They would drive to Times Square that same night. That plan, however, fell apart when they realized that the vehicle that they hijacked was low on gas and ordered the driver to stop at a nearby gas station.' Apparently the city left an impression on Tazhayakov as well, as he highlights their group trip. In addition to pictures from their trip, Tazhayakov posts about songs that he likes- including Green Day's 'When September Ends' and more recently Macklemore and Ryan Lewis' 'Can Not Hold Us', which he added on April 18, just days after the bombing. Waiting: Dias Kadyrbayev (pictured) is now being held without bail until the May 14 hearing, along with his friends Tazhayakov and Phillipos . Flashy: Kadyrbayev's affinity for nice cars prompted the investigation as he was first questioned by police about his 'humorous' vanity license plates that read 'TERRORISTA#1' Red flag: Police initially investigated the pair after the discovery of their license plates (pictured) but then held them on immigration charges since they are Kazakh nationals in the country on expired academic visas . On his profile, fellow arrestee Dias Kadyrbayev posted the Times Square group shot, along with another undated picture of himself with Tsarnaev and other friends. Kadyrbayev also features pictures of himself on a sunny beach, goofing around with a friend while climing in a tree, and posing in a luxury car. Kadyrbayev's affinity for flashy cars is what got them into trouble in the first place with police, as they were initially questioned when it was revealed that the BMW that had a vanity license plate that read 'TERRORISTA#1'. His lawyer argued that the plate was a gag gift, police became suspicious and then held both he and Tazhayakov in custody because of immigration issues, as their student visas had expired. On Wednesday, they both were charged with conspiring to obstruct justice by destroying evidence. The criminal complaint lists that they removed Dzhokhar's backpack from his room and 'agreed to get rid of it after concluding from news reports that Tsarnaev was one of the Boston Marathon bombers.' Girlfriend: Though a girl who had a brief romantic relationship with Tsarnaev has come forward, the girl in this picture seen being kissed by Kadyrbayev has not been identified . Mystery woman: The girl seen with Tazhayakov in this picture has not been identified either . The three friends- Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov and Phillipos- went over to Tsarnaev's on-campus dormitory after seeing the news reports. When the group arrived at the dorm, Kadyrbayev showed Tazhayakov a text from the bomber that said 'I'm about to leave if you need something in my room take it.' He did not specify where he was going, but Tazhayakov told investigators that he felt that this meant he would never see Tsarnaev alive again. They were let in the room by Dzhokhar's roommate, who said that Dzhokhar had been there just a few hours earlier. The criminal complaint says that when there, the three friends watched a movie. Kadyrbayev 'knew' that Tsarnaev was involved in the fatal attack when he saw the empty fireworks in the dorm room.","Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev traveled to New York in 2012 .

The BBC has suspended a Panorama employee and dropped an episode of the programme after a producer was accused of trying to bribe a security consultant for information. The episode of the flagship documentary was due to air on Monday and was described by The Radio Times as âan investigation into financial scandals that could wipe out peopleâs life savings, including a Â£250 million Caribbean rental-home development schemeâ. The programme looked into the activities of Harlequin Property, a developer of Caribbean luxury homes, but BBC bosses decided to pull it last Thursday after the firm complained of the âshockingâ approach, The Times reported. It is alleged Panorama producer Matthew Chapman suggested the property company Mr Ghent was contracted to work for couldnât pay its bills and offered him the âcheekyâ possibility of work with the BBC in exchange for inside information, it is claimed. The Panorama broadcast was pulled and the producer has been suspended pending a BBC investigation . Mr Chapman allegedly wrote in the email he âmay be able to put things your wayâ for information, and signed off: 'Itâs always good to keep one eye on the future!â But the property company said the approach was âtantamount to a bribeâ. Mr Ghent told The Times that he received an email two weeks ago from Matthew Chapman, who described himself as an award-winning Panorama producer doing a programme partly on Harlequin. The email said: âI was wondering if I could be a bit cheeky here. âItâs unlikely that Ames [Harlequinâs chairman David Ames] and maybe Harlequin will be around for much longer, nor will he have money to pay people for much longer. âThere are [sic] a long list of creditors already I understand. âPanorama and the BBC is [sic] always using security and protection officers and although I cannot guarantee anything we may be able to put things your way. A letter from Harlequin to the BBC said: 'In short, it appears to be tantamount to an attempted bribe' âOr we could work together on stories. Itâs always good to keep one eye on the future! How would you feel helping me out in a totally confidential way.â Mr Ghent said that he was shocked by the producerâs approach to him via the LinkedIn website on March 13. He said:âHe was suggesting my job might disappear. It seemed to me he was trying to offer me an enticement.â Harlequin complained to the BBC last Wednesday and the next day the programme was removed from the schedule. In a letter to the BBCâs litigation department Harlequin described Mr Chapmanâs approach as âsimply staggeringâ and âtantamount to an attempted bribe.â âPanorama and the BBC is [sic] always using security and protection officers and although I cannot guarantee anything we may be able to put things your way. âOr we could work together on stories. Itâs always good to keep one eye on the future! How would you feel helping me out in a totally confidential way.â - Mr Chapman's alleged e-mail . The letter said: âOn any sensible interpretation, the message to Mr Ghent is simply staggering. âIt appears to constitute a flagrant and in our view highly improper attempt by [the journalist] to induce Mr Ghent into disclosing information about Harlequin in return for the potential reward of future work from the BBC. âIn short, it appears to be tantamount to an attempted bribe.â The BBC said yesterday that it had suspended a member of the Panorama team and started disciplinary proceedings. A BBC spokesman said: âIn light of information received late in the production process of this film the BBC decided to postpone broadcast. âWe are currently reviewing the facts. As a result a member of the team has been suspended and a disciplinary procedure is under way.â The Corporationâs anti-bribery policy states: âThe BBC takes a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption and is committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all its business dealings and relationships wherever it operates.â The Serious Fraud Office and Essex Police are looking into complaints in relation to Harlequin and have appealed for information from anyone who has invested in the company. Thousands of people invested up to Â£300 million into Harlequin schemes and hundreds have been left without payments due from the company. Some claimed that they were misadvised by external advisers about the risks of transferring pension funds into schemes which they now fear may never materialise. There is no suggestion Harlequin is unable to meet its obligations.","Matthew Chapman alleged to have tempted a security guard with a job offer .

And the lack or rain in America's breadbasket is intensifying at an unprecedented rate, driving concern food prices could soar if crops in the world's key producer are decimated. The latest US Drought Monitor reported a nearly threefold increase in areas of extreme drought in the course of a single week in the nine Midwestern states where three-quarters of the country's corn and soybean crops are produced.

Above, a field of dead corn sits next to an ethanol plant in Palestine, Illinois last week . The percentage of the nation's corn crop rated very poor or poor rose to 48 per cent in the week ending July 29, while 47 per cent of the soybean crop was in very poor or poor condition, according to the US Department of Agriculture. That is the worst rating since the drought of 1988, which cut production by 20 per cent and cost the economy tens of billions of dollars. The U.S. Agriculture Department last . week raised its estimates of food price inflation due to soaring grain . prices tied to the drought, saying prices could rise as much as 3.5 per . cent this year and another 3 to 4 per cent in 2013, led by meat. And with grazing pastures also parched and feed prices at record highs, many ranchers are sending their animals to slaughter early because it is too costly to keep them until full size. Buyers in China and other hungry nations are concerned that the expected sharp drop in U.S. harvests will cause shortages and price spikes. Above, a drought-damaged corn field near Kilbourne, Illinois . Meteorologists said there were chances for rain through the weekend in the Midwest farm belt. 'The U.S. weather model has a little wetter forecast than yesterday, but overall it looks like a similar pattern in August that we saw at the end of July,' said Jason Nicholls, meteorologist for AccuWeather. He said 0.25 to 0.75 inch of rain could fall into the weekend in the northern and eastern Midwest, with about 70 per cent coverage. From 0.10 to 0.50 inch of rain was forecast for the central and southern Midwest, with 50 per cent coverage. The rains could benefit the soybean crop, which will be setting pods the next two weeks - a crucial phase in their reproductive cycle that determines yield and final production. Agronomists had said that the hardy soybean crop needs just a fifth of the rain that corn needs due to its much smaller biomass, and that timely rains could help soybeans flourish. President Barack Obama's . administration has opened up protected US land to help farmers and . ranchers and has encouraged crop insurance companies to forgo charging . interest for a month. It has also provided emergency . low-interest loans to farmers in the 1,234 counties across 31 states . which have been declared disaster areas due to the drought. Local governments are also trying to . help. The state of Missouri has offered millions in grants to help . farmers and ranchers drill or deepen wells and expand irrigation . systems. Experts predict there will still be a . sizable harvest -- just not anywhere close to the bounty of recent . years or the bumper crop predicted before the rain stopped. And that will likely bring price increases for food and all types of products for years to come. 'We're not just talking about the . fact that things are going to be tight here in the United States,' said . Sam Funk, senior economist with Doane Advisory Services. 'When you look at such a large . portion of the corn and soybean crop that gets exported, you're going to . talk about substantially impacting a number of other marketplaces.' The impact spreads far beyond just . cereal or bread - or a single growing season - because so much of the . US crop is used as livestock feed and those herds are being culled, Funk . said. The U.S. Agriculture Department has raised its estimates of food price inflation due to soaring grain prices tied to the drought, saying prices could rise as much as 3.5 per cent this year.

Out in the fields, many farmers are . trying to salvage what they can by chopping the stunted plants into feed . for livestock. So few ears of corn are growing, it just isn't worth . harvesting. Worries about the worst drought in . more than half a century afflicting the world's largest grain exporter . also deepened overseas. Buyers . in China and other hungry nations are concerned that the expected sharp . drop in U.S. harvests will cause shortages and price spikes. One of the top corporate leaders in agriculture . warned that the government must act quickly to reduce the amount of corn . going into ethanol to prevent a sharp spike in food prices. Greg . Page, chief executive of global grains trading giant Cargill Inc, . joined a chorus of critics of biofuels by urging the U.S. government to . temporarily curb its quotas to produce corn-based ethanol fuel. Page said on CNBC that the U.S. biofuel mandate 'needs to be addressed' through existing policy tools. Otherwise, the spike in U.S. corn and . soybean prices to record highs will 'ration' demand in ways that will . hurt food production too much. 'If all of that is only on livestock or food consumers, it really makes the burden disproportionate. 'What . we see are 3 or 4 percent declines in supply lead to 40 to 50 per cent . increases in prices, and I think the mandates are what drives that,' he . said. In 2011, almost . 40 per cent of the giant U.S. corn crop went into making ethanol, and . the U.S. still exported more than half of all corn shipments worldwide. 'There is a methodology to reduce the amount of biofuels that is mandated in the U.S,' Page said. On Monday, U.S. livestock groups appealed to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to curb or suspend the mandate, warning against the ruinous impact of soaring feed costs. Corn and soybean meal make up basic animal feedstuffs. Grain analysts polled by Reuters pointed to a U.S. corn crop of 11.2 billion bushels, the smallest in six years and down 14 per cent from USDA's latest forecast of 12.97 billion. Initial forecasts were for a crop of more than 14 billion bushels. Soybeans, which were planted later and until now escaped the drought's pressure, are now also being hurt. Analysts predict a 2.834 billion bushel harvest, the smallest in four years, and down from USDA's latest estimate of 3.05 billion bushels. Oilseed processor and ethanol producer Archer Daniels Midland Inc reported a larger than expected 25 per cent drop in quarterly profit yesterday due in part to higher corn prices causing it to lose money making ethanol. 'In a challenging fourth quarter, solid results from our global oilseeds business, particularly in South America, were more than offset by negative U.S. ethanol margins and weaker U.S. merchandising results,' ADM CEO Patricia Woertz said. Brokerage BB&T Capital Markets last week lowered its earnings forecasts for U.S. pork producer Smithfield Foods Inc and U.S. chicken producer Sanderson Farms Inc, citing corn prices. But some said that easing off ethanol production - already at a two-year low amid soaring corn prices - was unnecessary. In Iowa, the largest U.S. corn and soybean producer, Gov. Terry Branstad said he opposed an ethanol waiver. 'Even if you took that kind of action, it probably would have no action on soybean and corn prices,' Branstad said. Ray Bardole of Rippey, Iowa, a soybean farmer and industry official now touring China,said he has been reassuring the worried Chinese, who are the biggest importers of U.S. soybeans. 'As we have met with folks from the government, as well as the Chinese media and our customers themselves, that is absolutely the very top thing on their mind,' he said. At the Chicago Board of Trade, corn and soybean markets eased back from new record highs this week as traders took their profits. December corn futures closed down 1.1 per cent at $8.05 - 1/4 per bushel and November soybeans closed down 0.2 per cent at $16.41 per bushel. 'We are continuing to see a deterioration of the crops,' grains analyst Karl Setzer of MaxYield Cooperative in West Bend, Iowa said, referring to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's crop progress report issued on Monday. That report said 24 per cent of the domestic corn crop was in good-to-excellent condition as of Sunday, down from 26 per cent the previous week. That was slightly better than trade expectations for a three-point drop. The soybean crop was 29 per cent in that category, down from 31 per cent in the previous week. Those ratings were the worst for those crops since the last major drought in 1988.","Food price inflation could rise by as much as 3.5% this year, says US Agriculture Department .

Wounded war veterans are to receive Â£7,000-a-year for life to ensure welfare reforms do not affect the military. In future maimed forces veterans will not face extra assessments of their disability by civil servants to confirm the results of existing military tests. Disability minister Esther McVey told MailOnline said the new funds would recognise the âunique support needs of veteransâ. Injured war veterans will not face having their disability repeatedly reassessed under welfare reforms which will ensure they receive almost Â£7,000-a-year for life . She revealed the total amount available to injured soldiers, sailors and pilots will be Â£6,988.80 per year, more than Â£200 extra than thought when the policy was announced last year. Disability Living Allowance is being scrapped from April but ministers have agreed that the payments will be continued for former defence personnel whose injuries sustained in the line of duty affect their quality of life. The Personal Independence Payment will be paid to all working-age people with serious problems, but claimants will be re-examined and could have payments cut. Disability minister Esther McVey said the government wanted to recognise the unique support needs of veterans . However, the Armed Forces Independence Payment will be awarded by the Ministry of Defence as part of the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme and will not affect any other benefits to which claimants are entitled. Injured ex-troops will automatically receive on-going payments to help with the additional costs associated with their injuries. Miss McVey said: âA considerable sacrifice is made by a number of courageous members of the Armed Forces who have been injured as a result of their service to the Nation. âThat is why we are simplifying and streamlining the welfare support for the most severely injured veterans when they return to the UK. âIt will help to recognise the unique support needs of veterans.â The governmentâs major reforms of the welfare system will see the introduction of a single payment for most benefits â known as the Universal Credit â rolled out from this year. But ministers insist job-seeking forces veterans will not lose out when the new system comes into force., . Any ongoing income that veterans get from Ministry of Defence compensation schemes and the new Armed Forces Independence Payment will not be taken into account when calculating how much support they should receive through Universal Credit. In July David Cameron intervened in a benefits row after it emerged wounded troops would not automatically receive help under new welfare rules. Details of the Armed Forces Independence Payment emerged last year during a visit to Camp Bastion in Afghanistan by Prime Minister David Cameron . During a visit to Camp Bastion in Afghanistan, the Prime Minister promised a âspecial dealâ in a sign that Britain ârespects and reveresâ its Armed Forces. At the time it was thought inured ex-military personnel would receive around Â£6,700-a-year towards care and the cost of living. But Miss McVey said the figure would be higher, starting at Â£6,988.80 from its introduction in April. The reforms scrap the need for anyone with granted compensation for war injuries to undergo a separate assessment by civil servants before they could be granted benefits.","New Armed Forces Independence Payment to be paid to maimed forces veterans .

"PUBLISHED: . 10:25 EST, 28 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:34 EST, 29 March 2013 . BlackBerry has sold around one million of the new Z10 smartphones it hopes will help restore the firm to the top table in mobile technology. The handset's performance is widely seen as being key to the company's fortunes after a difficult couple of years when the firm lost ground and customers to rivals including Apple and Samsung. Today, the mobile giant announced a return to profitability in the most recent quarter and posted earnings of 98 million US dollars (Â£65 million) after recording a substantial loss in the same period last year. The Z10 will be available in black and white - just like Apple's iPhone 5 . Its president and chief executive Thorsten Heins said customers ""love"" the new device which was launched in January with the motto ""redesigned, re-engineered, re-invented"". 'We have implemented numerous changes at BlackBerry over the past year and those changes have resulted in the company returning to profitability in the fourth quarter,' Mr Heins said. 'With the launch of BlackBerry 10, we have introduced the newest and what we believe to be the most innovative mobile computing platform in the market today.' He said the company would remain focused on improving its profitability and efficiency while driving innovation in the next fiscal year. The handset's performance is widely seen as being key to the company's future fortunes . 'We have built an engine that is able to drive improved financial performance at lower volumes, which should allow us to generate additional benefits from higher volumes in the future,' he added.The one million Z10 phones sold bettered analysts' expectations of about 915,000. When the Z10 touchscreen device was unveiled, Mr Heins welcomed a 'new day in the history of BlackBerry' following what he termed the most challenging year of his career. The firm's market share fell from 41per cent in 2007, when the first iPhone came out, to 4% in the first quarter of last year. BlackBerry drew widespread criticism after an ""outage"" in October 2011 which saw millions of people around the world left unable to access emails, surf the web or use BlackBerry Messenger (BBM). The Z10 went on sale in the UK earlier this year. In today's report, BlackBerry said it shipped around six million handsets in the three months to March 2. Revenue has fallen by 36% to 2.7 billion US dollars (Â£1.8 billion) in the past year. In the fourth quarter, the company recorded a 2% dip, with revenue down by about 49 million US dollars (Â£32.4 million) on the previous three months. The fourth quarter results show BlackBerry - formerly known as Research In Motion - has lost about three million subscribers in the past three months, a figure which now stands at 76 million. Stuart Miles, founder of technology and gadget site Pocket-lint, said the shipping of one million Z10 handsets in three months was unlikely to be enough to ensure a turnaround for BlackBerry. 'The UK did not take to the Z10 as well as it has done to other devices out there,' he said. 'The iPhone 5 took three days to sell a million and the SGS4 (Samsung's latest offering) will probably take the same time.' President and Chief Executive Officer of Resarch in Motion (RIM), Thorsten Heins, promoted the new BlackBerry touch screen handsets together with US singer Alicia Keys in New York City, in January . He added: 'I think the more worrying thing is the fact that they have lost around 33,000 subscribers every day for the last three months. 'If that continues at the same rate, and obviously they are hoping it won't, they are losing what amounts to 12 million a year. That's five years and they're out. 'Unless they can change that exodus, there won't be anybody left to use the system, no matter how good it is.' The BlackBerry, pioneered in 1999, was the dominant smartphone among businesses before the arrival of the iPhone in 2007. The Z10 received favourable reviews after it went on sale in the UK, about two months before its US launch.","Seen as key to the company's fortunes after a difficult couple of years .

A judge warned foreign criminals yesterday that Britain is not a âsoft touchâ as he jailed a Romanian gang for a Â£1million theft campaign. The ten gang members exploited EU border laws to travel freely between Romania and the UK purely to steal high-quality gold from Turkish and Indian jewellery shops.

This robbery shows one of the thieves holding a door open to prevent it from being locked shut while another smashes through an inner door with a sledgehammer . They were handed sentences totalling 82 years and ten months for seven ruthless raids between March and September last year.

Donald and Margaret Knight, aged 78 and 77, were found in different rooms of their Â£500,000 remote property in Loddington, Northamptonshire, on Wednesday afternoon. Police also found the body of the coupleâs dog, believed to be a Dachshund, which had been shot. It has been suggested Mr Knight may have killed his wife before turning the gun on himself. Donald and Margaret Knight and their pet dog were found dead at their luxury farmhouse in Loddington, Northamptonshire . Police were called to Loddington Coppice Farm, Northamptonshire, yesterday afternoon where they discovered the dead elderly couple . A Northamptonshire Police spokesman said: 'Following the deaths of . Donald and Margaret Knight on Wednesday 1 May, a forensic post mortem . examination took place last night at Leicester Royal Infirmary. 'The cause of death in both instances has been confirmed as a gunshot wound to the head.' DCI Mark Behan said: 'I know that this tragic incident has shocked . people in the local community and would like to offer reassurance that . we are not seeking anyone else in connection with it. 'My thoughts and condolences are with the family at this difficult time.' Officers said they were not looking . for anyone else in connection with the deaths and released a statement . from the coupleâs daughters Sarah, 48, and Susan, 53. The sisters said: âWe are devastated by this tragic news and wish to thank people for their kind words. âDonald and Margaret were a couple who loved each otherâs company. âThey were lovely parents and grandparents whose passing is a massive loss to our lives.â A lifelong friend of Mr Knight yesterday revealed that Mary - who was known as Margaret - had been ill for a number of years. Richard Clare, 78, grew up with Mr Knight in the village of Old, Northamptonshire, where his haulage company Knights of Old was established over a century ago. He described the former chairman of the company as a âpillar of the communityâ and said he built the farmhouse in Loddington after selling the family business 15 years ago. Mr Clare said: 'The business was set up around the back of the village here and he was the third generation to run it. 'He was a pillar of this community. Everyone knew him and he was the parish council chairman for a number of years.' Police are probing whether the retired haulage company director murdered his elderly wife before killing himself at their remote country farmhouse . Family friends said Mr Knight had built Loddington Coppice Farm after retiring from his family's haulage firm . 'He sold the company because he was the last one of the Knights and they moved out of the village and built the farmhouse then. 'Itâs lovely inside it and they liked it because it was in a remote place with no neighbours. I knew his wife Mary had been ill but I donât know if it was terminal or what it was. 'He was such a lovely guy, I canât imagine it ever getting too much for him if he was looking after her but I really donât know. 'I grew up with him and there was a group of us. He was a friend, although I hadnât seen him for a year or two because he has moved out of the village and doesnât come back.' Results of post-mortem examinations into the deaths are expected to be released tomorrow. Northamptonshire Police have revealed they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths - suggesting a possible murder suicide. A police spokeswoman said: 'After receiving a report at 2.10pm on Wednesday, police discovered the body of a 77-year-old woman and a 78-year-old man. We are not seeking anyone else in connection with these deaths. 'A forensic post mortem examination will be taking place at Leicester Royal Infirmary to establish the cause of death.' Mr Knight was well-known as the third-generation of his family to run Knights of Old - an international shipping company based in nearby Kettering. A spokesman for the organisation yesterday confirmed Mr Knight held the position of chairman at the distribution company until he retired 15 years ago. The business was set up by one of his ancestors, William Knight, in 1865. A spokesman for the company said: 'Mr Knight was the third generation of his family here and held the position of chairman. Mr and Mrs Knight's daughters, Sarah and Susan, said they have been left 'devastated' by their parents' deaths . 'He sold his shares and retired as far as we are aware 15 years ago. Another family has owned the business since and we have not spoken to Mr Knight's family yet. 'There are still a few people working here who knew him personally and worked with him.' Locals in the village expressed shock at the sudden deaths of the popular elderly pair. One regular at The Hare pub, which . sits two miles from where the couple lived, said: 'Donald shot her, then . the dog then turned the gun on himself. 'He was always shooting pheasants there so you heard gunshots sometimes. Northamptonshire Police revealed they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths - suggesting a possible murder suicide . 'I didn't know them well but one lady . said she was shouted at by Mr Knight's wife when she tried to sell her . raffle tickets three years ago. 'She told me she drove down their . drive and got out but Mrs Knight opened an upstairs window and told her . to go away and get off her land. 'There were also rumours that he had . problems with money and people wanting money off him - so maybe they . were worried about their security.' Local residents also confirmed the couple had a daughter called Sarah Knight, 49, who is believed to live in a nearby village. A neighbour of her ex-partner David . Abbott, 48, who did not want to be named, said: 'I just spoke to David . on the phone. He is in bits. 'He split up with Sarah seven or eight years ago but he knew the family well so is devastated. 'We're not sure what drove him to do this. It is just so tragic.' Residents told how the couple - who built their dream home together ten years ago - seemed nothing but devoted to one another. Conservative councillor Jim Hakewill, who is the mayor of Kettering Borough Council, said he spoke to Mr Knight on Tuesday while he was on the campaign trail. Today, he said: 'I literally just knocked on his door this week and we were talking about writing a book. 'We had a conversation about politics and we were talking about years ago when I was a farmer's son and had to take my tractor to his company. 'He said he had left the company years ago and was going to write a book. They've been a local family around here for donkeys years. 'I'm so sad to hear what's happened, I really am. I'm so sorry for his family. He seemed fine to me when I saw him. He was in good spirits and talking about writing a book.' Another villager, John Townsend, 65, added: 'His family were the founders of Knights of Old. I knew Donald was the chairman but he retired ages ago. 'They built that farmhouse for themselves about ten years ago. I heard a helicopter hovering over in the afternoon and loads of police cars screamed through the village. 'My son said there was ten outside the house. It's horrible to think that it might be a murder suicide. 'No-one I've spoke to seems to know why it would have happened.

The square was packed with thousands of onlookers commemorating the day Jesus is believed to have been killed by the Romans, two day before miraculously rising from the dead on Easter Sunday. Brisk temperatures did not deter the audience from experiencing the time-honoured tradition of the passion play. Crowds: Thousands turned out to watch the play in the heart of central London . Beginnings: Jesus entering Jerusalem on a donkey to a welcome of palm leaves . Trial: Jesus is shown being judged by the Roman procurator Pontius Pilate . Crowds: Actors mingled with the audience as the play built to its inevitable conclusion . King of Kings: The 41-year-old actor bears a striking physical resemblance to traditional depictions of Jesus . Dramatic performances of the last hours of Jesus' life are a key part of the Easter celebration in many European countries, and this year worshippers from around the world have been pictured re-enacting the events of Good Friday. The tradition has been less strong in Britain but has seen a resurgence in recent years, with more than a dozen performances taking place in the UK today. The play was put on twice in Trafalgar Square by the Wintershall Players, a group based in Surrey and founded by enthusiast Peter Hutley. Torment: The play follows Christ as he drags the cross through Jerusalem wearing a crown of thorns . Taunts: Jesus is goaded by the Romans as he drags his cross on his way to be crucified . Violent: The story was told in brutal honesty with shocking levels of blood and gore . Graphic: Passion plays are supposed to remind Christians of how Jesus suffered for their sins . O Jesus, Who by reason of Thy burning love for ushast willed to be crucifiedand to shed Thy Most Precious Bloodfor the redemption and salvation of our souls,look down upon us here gathered togetherin remembrance of Thy most sorrowful Passion and Death,fully trusting in Thy mercy;cleanse us from sin by Thy grace,sanctify our toil,give unto us and unto all those who are dear to us our daily bread,sweeten our sufferings,bless our families,and to the nations so sorely afflicted,grant Thy peace,which is the only true peace,so that by obeying Thy commandmentswe may come at last to the glory of heaven.Amen.

Past performances have been even more painful, however - once an amateur actor in Leicester hit him so hard with a mallet while miming driving the nails in that Mr Burke-Dunsmore had to go to hospital with fractured ankles. Although the actor insists he does not suffer from delusions of grandeur while portraying his illustrious subject, he has in the past channelled the Christian spirit to get out of sticky situations.

Hours of audio recordings of 'confessions' made by Charles Manson's right-hand man could provide vital details of unsolved murders carried out by their notorious 1960s gang. Los Angeles Police Department has made a request for eight hours of taped conversations between Charles 'Tex' Watson and his lawyer Bill Boyd, America's NBC reported. Detectives believe the recordings could hold new information about killings carried out by the Manson Family, which in 1969 murdered seven people including film director Roman Polanski's pregnant wife Sharon Tate. Notorious: Serial killers Charles 'Tex' Watson, 66, (left) and Charles Manson, 77 . In a letter obtained by NBC, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck asked the US Department of Justice to hand over the tapes . 'The LAPD has information that Mr Watson discussed additional unsolved murders committed by followers of Charles Manson,' Chief Beck said in the March 19 letter. 'It is requested that the original recordings be given to the LAPD in order to determine if information regarding unsolved murders was included.' Watson, 66, like his one-time leader Manson, is currently serving a life sentence for his involvement in the murders. He was originally sentenced to death for killing Sharon Tate Polanski, Abigail Ann Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Thomas Jay Sebring and Steven Earl Parent. However, California temporarily suspended the death penalty in 1972, and he has been serving a life sentence ever since. Murdered: Actress Sharon Tate was eight and a half months pregnant when she was killed . He was denied parole last November, as was Manson this April - Manson's 12th, and possibly last, bid for freedom. Mr Boyd was Watson's attorney from 1969 and 'for some time thereafter', according to the letter from Chief Beck. However, the lawyer died in 2009 and his Texas-based firm is being liquidated. Request: An excerpt of the letter from LAPD Chief Charlie Beck to the US Department of Justice, asking them to hand over the Charles 'Tex' Watson recordings . NBC reported that a decision on whether to give LAPD the recordings will be made at a bankruptcy court hearing due to take place next Tuesday in Plano, Texas. Chief Beck asked for the audio tapes to be given to a detective in the LAPD's 'special section', which is part of its robbery-homicide division. The recordings were private until September 1976 when Watson authorised their sale to author Chaplain Ray Hoekstra to help cover legal fees. The material was used in Mr Hoekstra's book 'Will You Die For Me?' which was released in 1976. Targeted: The Benedict Canyon estate, sheltered in the hills of Los Angeles, where actress Sharon Tate was murdered along with four others on August 9, 1969 . Charles Manson, now 77, is one of America's most notorious mass murderers. Amid the hippie culture of the 1960s, the charismatic ex-convict put together a collection of runaways and outcasts known as the Manson Family. In the summer of 1969 he became one of the 20th century's most infamous criminals when he directed his mostly young, female followers to murder seven people. Actress Sharon Tate was stabbed 16 times by members of the cult in the early morning hours of August 9, 1969 at the Benedict Canyon estate, sheltered in the hills of Los Angeles. She was eight and a half months pregnant. Four other people were stabbed or shot to death in Tate's home that night by the Manson followers, who scrawled the word 'Pig' in blood on the front door before leaving. The following night, Manson's group stabbed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca to death, using their blood to write 'Rise,' 'Death to Pigs' and 'Helter Skelter' - a misspelled reference to the Beatles song - on the walls and refrigerator door. Murder scene: The room where Sharon Tate was brutally killed by the Manson Family . Manson is imprisoned at Corcoran State Prison in Kings County, California. He was convicted of the seven slayings as well as the murder of an acquaintance, Gary Hinman, who was stabbed to death in July 1969. Like Watson, he was originally given a death sentence but spared execution after the California Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional. In 1977, his sentence was commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Manson will next be eligible for parole in 15 years, when he will be 92-years-old. When he was denied release in 2007 the parole board ruled that he 'continues to pose an unreasonable danger to others and may still bring harm to anyone he would come in contact with'.","LAPD requests eight hours of taped conversations between Manson Family member Charles 'Tex' Watson and his lawyer Bill Boyd .

A missing 14-year old girl has been found in Mexico with the 26-year-old man who she disappeared with days before he was due to face trial for rape. Mexican officials contacted North Richland Hills police this morning to say that Ruby Contreras and Stephan Cox, 26, who is accused of abusing another girl, had been found. Both were said to be safe and were being held by police. It wasnât immediately clear when or where in the country they had been found. CCTV: A surveillance camera picture from a convenience store in Abilene, Texas showing missing North Richland Hills teen Ruby Contreras and alleged kidnapper Stephan Cox . Police in Mexico found Stephan Andrew Cox, 26, left, from Ohio and Ruby Conteras, 14, right, from Texas. Cox, who is from Ohio, is due to appear in court on charges of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor following a separate incident in January. In that case a girl, also 14, from North Strabane Township, Pennsylvania, allegedly stole her mother's car to drive to meet the older man she had first encountered online, according to WFAA.COM. Cox was charged with rape when the pair were discovered. Keith Bauman, an investigator with the North Richland Hills police near Fort Worth, told the Star Telegram that he was pleased Ruby was returning home. 'This is very good news, we couldnât ask for a better ending to this investigation. 'The officials of the government of Mexico have been more than accommodating with our investigation. 'We owe our gratitude to their efforts in locating these two individuals and working with us to bring them home.' Family worry: Ruby's sister Jiovanna Contreras said: 'She always came home at 4:12pm every day' Police yesterday released surveillance pictures of the pair taken at a convenience store in Abilene, Texas. They were last seen in El Paso before being discovered across the border. Cox had been placed under house arrest and was supposed to be electronically monitored, according to the Star Telegram. Authorities are now working to have the two returned home and the teenager reunited with her frantic family. Ruby was last seen last week at North Oaks Middle School in Haltom City. Her family alerted police after she failed to come home from school on April 24. Runaway: Ruby Contreras, 14, ran off with Stephan Cox, 26. It's believed the two took a bus to El Paso, Texas before heading across the Mexican border . Missing: Stephan Cox was already wanted in court in relation to another 14-year-old girl from Pennsylvania who stole her parents car in order to meet him . Officers conducted searches and canvassed the area surrounding the school but were unable to locate the teen. Investigators believe the pair took a Greyhound bus from Fort Worth to El Paso. Ruby's family desperately appealed for information in the days after her disappearance. 'Iâm scared for her. I don't know what this man is telling her. I donât know what he's doing. I'm just scared for her,' her sister Jiovanna Contreras told NBC. Her father Alfonso added: 'I don't know why this happened. I can't believe it.'","Teenager Ruby Contreras ran off with Stephan Cox, who is accused of raping another teen .

Three teenage boys have been charged with the murder of a 17-year-old girl who was shot in the head while the group were robbing summer homes - despite none of them firing the gun which killed her. Scott Bryd, Dillon Tyree and Daniel Parnell, all 18, were indicted on felony murder charges on Wednesday by a grand jury after Summer Moody's death. Miss Moody was fatally injured after homeowners fired warning shots on Gravine Island, Alabama when they saw the group robbing cabins around 4am on April 15. Scroll down for video . Wrong place: Summer Moody, 17, (left) died after being shot in the head. She was with boys who were robbing cabins including Daniel Parnell (right). All three have been charged with murder . Facing life: Scott Byrd, 18, who was Miss Moody's boyfriend and Dylan Tyree (right) are also charged with felony murder after being indicted . She died in hospital ten days later. Byrd, Tyree and Parnell are being held in the Baldwin County Corrections Center. No charges were filed against the men who fired the shots  in the Mobile-Tensaw River Delta, a remote fishing camp. William 'Nick' Hearn, Larry Dean . Duncan and Lonnie W. Davison faced no charges because the shooting . was deemed accidental by the district attorney. The three men were working nearby on April 15 when they heard suspicious sounds coming from homes nearby. The three got in a boat and went to investigate. Young life: Summer Moody was with her boyfriend and two friends when the group were caught robbing cabins at a remote fishing camp . They spotted Byrd and ordered him to . stop. Hearn fired a shot in the ground and Duncan fired a second. It is . believed that Duncan's shot Miss Moody where she was hiding in the . bushes. A grand jury is made up of citizens who decide whether a person should be charged with a crime - before the case proceeds to trial. The evidence usually comes from a government-appointed attorney and probable cause must be determined. At federal level, a grand jury has great power to access information and can subpoena whoever they like in order to prove criminal activity. All proceedings of the grand jury are secret. This prevents those who may reap their consequences from going on the run and to stop witnesses who may later appear at trial being tampered with. It also protects innocent people from fully disclosing what they know. In Alabama, a felony case cannot be tried without an indictment from a grand jury. They left but returned and put Miss Moody in their boat because it was faster to get her to shore for help. Baldwin County District Attorney Hallie Dixon told al.com: 'Essentially but for the actions of these young men that night Summer Moody would still be with us and still be alive.' Miss . Moody's family said that although the boys should be punished, they did . not pull the trigger. They were upset that nothing had been done to the . men who fired the shots that killed the 17-year-old. Byrd, who was Miss Moody's boyfriend, and his two friends were arrested following the night's tragic events. A . grand jury came to the conclusion that a murder charge should be . brought after reviewing all the evidence in the death investigation. They are each being held on $250,000 bail over the felony murder charge. Tyree had also been charged with assault and burglary charges.

Both David and Samantha Cameron were left red-faced when they accidentally left their eight-year-old daughter Nancy in the pub. But the Prime Minister's wife has revealed it was in fact her who was responsible for the mistake after failing to check the female toilets. The couple drove off from The Plough Inn in Cadsden, Buckinghamshire, in separate cars - both believing Nancy was with with the other. Whoops: David Cameron, pictured holding his daughter Nancy at a wedding in 2007, thought Samantha Cameron had all their children but she thought Nancy was with him . The Prime Minister was driven back to Chequers, which is two miles from the pub, with protection officers in one car, while Mrs Cameron drove their other children in another. Mr Cameron presumed that Nancy was in the car with his wife, while she thought that their daughter had jumped in with the Prime Minister. But when they arrived at Chequers, they realised Nancy was no where to be found and Mrs Cameron rushed back to the pub to pick her up. Mrs Cameron said: 'It was my fault. I was doing a sweep of gloves, hats, and I forgot to sweep the loos where she was.' She collected her daughter from the pub 15 minutes later to find her happily helping out the pub staff.

'They are their children and they take responsibility for them,' said the spokeswoman. 'No-one is going to face disciplinary action. This was an error.'

A self-confessed chocoholic who ate eleven thousand calories in chocolate bars alone each week has ditched her chocolate habit and managed to lose an impressive five stone. Tracey Burton, from Leek, Staffs, ate at least five chocolate bars a night - which is the equivalent of over 1,500 calories in just one sitting. The 42-year-old's love of Snickers and Mars bars saw her pile on the pounds, and she was soon left weighing almost 15 stone. Tracey lost five stone by ditching her daily chocolate habit and joining Weight Watchers . Tracey ate at least five chocolate bars every day, which at around 1500 additional calories, added up to a huge 11,000 calories each week . But now Tracey has turned her back on the sweet stuff, and has managed to lose five stone - and has even begun training to become weight loss leader herself. Tracey said: 'Whenever I was having a bad day or I was feeling stressed, I'd just turn to chocolate. 'I would eat five or six chocolate bars in one sitting and would probably happily carry on if I didn't force myself to stop. The 42-year-olds love of Snickers and Mars Bars saw her pile on the pounds, and she was soon left weighing almost 15 stone .

'If I was feeling down I knew it would just make me feel a little better - it was typical comfort eating. 'Now I wouldn't dream of eating that amount.

I can't believe it.' Tracey lost the weight at a healthy rate, losing about 2lbs a week, but she soon saw it making a huge difference .

It . was only when Tracey's partner, Roger Pickford, suffered a major health . scare that Tracey decided to do something about her weight. 'When Roger became ill it made me realise how precious life was. 'I didn't want to waste mine by over eating and suddenly I just jolted into action.

'I actually wanted to lose weight this time - unless you're in the right frame of mind it won't work. 'I decided I would chuck the chocolate and change my ways. It's weird how it just clicked.' Tracey joined Weight Watchers shortly afterwards and hasn't looked back since. 'I'd tried dieting in the past but I was never really prepared to stick to it properly. 'But this time I was determined.

The woman who lost her eyesight, lips, . nose, and hands when she was mauled by a chimpanzee in 2009 has been given $4million compensation by the estate of the animal's now-dead owner. Connecticut attack victim Charla Nash's brother filed a lawsuit on her behalf in 2009 in state Superior Court seeking $50million in damages from chimp owner Sandra Herold, who died in 2010. Nash was blinded, lost both hands and underwent a face transplant after being mauled outside Herold's home in Stamford in February 2009. Recovery: Charla Nash has settled an undisclosed lawsuit against the animal's now-dead owner after her face was ripped off . Attack: On Feb. 16, 2009, the 200-pound chimpanzee named Travis, left, mauled Charla Nash, right, causing her to lose her eyesight, lips, nose, and hands in the attack . The settlement agreement filed in Stamford Probate Court calls for Herold's estate to provide Nash with $3.4million in real estate, $331,000 in cash, $140,000 in machinery and equipment and $44,000 in vehicles. Lawyers for Nash's twin brother, . Michael Nash, accused executors of Herold's estate earlier this week of . withholding information needed to complete the settlement, according to a . court document. An attorney for Herold's estate said . today that his office has since provided the information and the . settlement is nearly finalized. 'The case is resolved,' said Brenden . Leydon, a Stamford lawyer representing Herold's estate. 'I think it was a . fair compromise on all sides.' Leydon had argued that Herold's . estate couldn't be sued because Charla Nash was an employee of Herold . and any claims were a worker's compensation matter. Vacation: Sandra Herold, the deceased owner of Travis, spoke openly and honestly about the bizarre world she and her animal lived in before the horrific attack . Happy: Miss Nash, pictured here with Travis, worked for Mrs Herold performing odd jobs and caring for the animal . Messages were left today for Michael Nash and his lawyer. Charla Nash's other brother, Stephen Nash, declined to comment. Charla Nash, 57, now lives in a . nursing home outside of Boston. She had gone to Herold's home on the day . of the attack to help lure Herold's 200-pound chimpanzee, Travis, back . into her home. But the animal went berserk and ripped off Nash's nose, lips, eyelids and hands before being shot to death by a police officer. Travis had starred in TV commercials . for Old Navy and Coca-Cola when he was younger and made an appearance on . the The Maury Povich Show. The chimpanzee was the constant . companion of the widowed Herold and was fed steak, lobster and ice . cream. The chimp could eat at the table, drink wine from a stemmed . glass, use the toilet and dress and bathe himself. A month after the mauling, Nash's family sued Herold for alleged negligence and recklessness. Reconstruction: In the attack, her eyes, nose, and lips were mauled off . Courageous: The survivor first revealed her mauled face on the Oprah Winfrey show; before the surgery, she kept a veil over her face . The lawsuit alleged Herold knew . Travis was dangerous but failed to confine him to a secure area and . allowed him to roam her property. It also claimed Herold gave the chimp medication that exacerbated his 'violent propensities'. Travis had previously bitten another . woman's hand and tried to drag her into a car in 1996, bit a man's thumb . two years later and escaped from her home and roamed downtown Stamford . for hours before being captured in 2003, according to the lawsuit. Nash' family is also trying to sue . the state for $150million but is awaiting permission from the state . claims commissioner. The state is immune from lawsuits unless they're . allowed by the claims commissioner. Nash wants to sue the state . Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, which she holds . responsible for not seizing the animal before the attack despite a state . biologist's warning it was dangerous. 'I hope and pray that the . commissioner will give me my day in court,' Charla Nash told reporters . following a hearing in August before Claims Commissioner J. Paul Vance . Jr. 'And I also pray that I hope this never happens to anyone else . again. It is not nice.' Court documents obtained by the AP on . Thursday show the settlement between Nash's family and Herold's estate . was approved on September 25 by the Stamford Probate Court and the two . sides met on November 13 to finalize it. A lawyer for Michael Nash, Matthew .

"By . Nadia Gilani . UPDATED: . 14:35 EST, 5 January 2012 . Drug lord: Benjamin Arellano Felix was at the helm of a cartel that smuggled tons of cocaine into the U.S. A Mexican drug lord who pleaded guilty to racketeering and conspiracy to launder money can be sentenced to no more than 25 years in jail. An agreement between Benjamin Arellano Felix, 58, - the leader of a cartel that once smuggled hundreds of tons of cocaine and marijuana into the United States and dissolved bodies of its rivals in vats of soda in the 1990s - and federal prosecutors was reached in San Diego yesterday. It is a lighter punishment than ordered for lower-ranking members of his once-mighty, Tijuana-based cartel. He also agreed to forfeit $100 million in profits. Prosecutors decided to dismiss other charges that could have brought 140 years in prison if he was convicted. Arellano Felix told a judge that he has been suffering migraines almost daily but that his headaches didn't impair his judgment to accept the prosecutors' offer. Yesterday's half-hour hearing was an . anticlimactic finish to the U.S. government's pursuit of the head of an . organisation that smuggled hundreds of tons of cocaine and marijuana to . the U.S. One of the most high-profile drug lords to face prosecution, Arellano Felix will be sentenced in April. Smugglers: Arellano Felix's cartel has an iron-tight grip on the drug trade from Mexico to the U.S. Picture: Mexico's border with the U.S. Arellano Felix's cartel, with its iron-tight grip on the drug trade along California's border with Mexico, was portrayed in the Steven Soderbergh film Traffic but has struggled in recent years as other cartels have become more ruthless than ever. The U.S. indictment said Arellano Felix was the top leader of a cartel he led with his brothers, going back to 1986. It says the cartel tortured and . killed rivals in the U.S. and Mexico as it smuggled Mexican . marijuana and Colombian cocaine. Robert Bonner, former head of the . U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and a former federal judge, said . the sentence 'may not be perfect justice but it certainly is adequate . justice.' Actor Benicio Del Toro in the 2000 film Traffic, which portrayed the workings of Arellano Felix's cartel . Del Toro's character in the film Traffic is jumped on by a police officer . He said there are many reasons why lower-ranking cartel members may get longer sentences, including strength of the evidence or the government's reluctance to disclose informants in a trial. 'You never have perfect equity in sentencing, and there's no reason to expect it,' said Mr Bonner, who was not involved in the case. Lawyers who have followed the case said the lighter sentence may be because the alleged crimes occurred many years ago and relied on witness accounts, instead of wiretaps or physical evidence. Benjamin Arellano Felix stands in his home on the day of his arrest in Puebla, Mexico . John Kirby, a former federal prosecutor who co-wrote the 2003 indictment against Arellano Felix, said cases can weaken over time as witnesses die or change their minds about testifying. 'This kind of case is based solely on witness testimony, and it slowly disintegrates,' he said. 'Maybe from the time when we put it together and now, it's not such a great case anymore.' Laura Duffy, the U.S. lawyer in San Diego who built much of her career on the case, said Arellano Felix is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison. 'Today's (Wednesday's) guilty plea marks the end of his reign of murder, mayhem and corruption, and his historic admission of guilt sends a clear message to the Mexican cartel leaders operating today. 'The United States will spare no effort to investigate, extradite and prosecute you for your criminal activities,' Ms Duffy said. Anthony Colombo Jr., Arellano Felix's lawyer, said his client could be released from U.S. prison in 20 years if credited for time served in this country and good behavior, assuming he gets the maximum 25-year sentence. As a Mexican citizen, he would then be deported to Mexico, where he still has nine years left on a sentence for related crimes. Mr Colombo said the government may have agreed to the deal to avoid having to bargain with 21 potential government witnesses for reduced sentences in exchange for their testimony. Francisco Javier Arellano Felix, the defendant's younger brother who led the cartel after Arellano Felix was arrested in Mexico in 2002, was sentenced to life in prison in 2007, a year after he was captured by U.S. authorities in international waters off Mexico's Baja California coast. Jesus Labra Aviles, a lieutenant under Benjamin Arellano Felix, was sentenced in San Diego to 40 years in prison in 2010.","Benjamin Arellano Felix was at the helm of a cartel peddling drugs with his brothers in the 1990s .

Researchers and archivists from University of California are asking for help in transcribing field notes and identifying insect specimens dating back over 100 years. Among the collection is a Tierra del Fuego beetle discovered in 1833 by Charles Darwin. Volunteers can look at the specimens and submit their transcriptions online using the Berkeley university's Calbug system. Citizen scientists will be able transcribe labels similar to the one pictured, which shows a ground beetle from Tierra del Fuego, Chile that was collected in 1833 by Charles Darwin. Volunteers can look through the other collections from UC Berkeley's Essig Museum of Entomology and submit transcriptions using its Calbug system . Calbug is an online project that hopes to . digitise arthropod specimen records from California. The team behind the project plan to use . these records to examine impacts of climate change and habitat modification. The project is a . collaboration between eight entomological collections in California. As part of Calbug, citizen scientists can submit their analsyis of specimens on the Zooniverse. Zooniverse is a web portal owned and operated by the Citizen Science Alliance. It was developedÂ  from the original Galaxy Zoo project and now runs more than a dozen projects that let volunteers take part in scientific research. As of 30 January 2013, the Zooniverse community consisted of more than 785,000 volunteers, gaining on average 500-1,000 daily registrations. The volunteers are often collectively referred to as 'Zooites'. Calbug teamed up with two other natural history collections â one focused on plants and the other on birds â to create Notes from Nature, a citizen science project that draws on the public to tame the voluminous records stored in drawers, jars and bookshelves in natural history museums throughout the world. Calbug co-investigator Kipling Will, associate professor of Environmental, Science Policy and Management at the university said: 'What really turns people on is knowing that they are contributing to science in a meaningful way.' These citizen science projects speak to the importance of public engagement in science.' 'Without the help of citizen scientists, processing the sheer volume of records held in natural history collections â estimated to be well over 2 billion worldwide â would take generations,' added Rosemary Gillespie, director of the Essig Museum and principal investigator of the Calbug project. Notes from Nature is among the many projects in the Zooniverse - a web-portal where citizens can help answer a diverse range of scientific questions, such as how stars form, what whale calls mean, and what life was like in the ancient Egyptian town of Oxyrhynchus. Arfon Smith, director of citizen science at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago and the technical lead for Zooniverse said: 'Our projects help answer research questions that can only be solved by a significant amount of human attention â they require people, not computers.' 'People have responded in a way that is truly great. There is an appetite for contributing to something real.' UC Berkeley graduate student Joan Ball holds a display of specimens at the Essig Museum of Entomology. There are around 6.5 million specimens in California's eight major entomological collections that need digitising as part of the Zooniverse project . In addition to insects, Notes from Nature participants can help digitize plant records from the Southeast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections (SERNEC). The SERNEC collections include thousands of specimen images, labels and ledgers from hundreds of herbaria in the Southeast United States. The Calbug project originally began with support from a 2010 National Science Foundation grant to digitize the first million â out of 6.5 million total â specimens from Californiaâs eight major entomological collections. As well as UC Berkeley, Calbug includes insect collections from the California Academy of Sciences, UC Davis, UC Riverside, UC Santa Cruz, the California State Collection of Arthropods, Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, San Diego Natural History Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum. Among the collection of specimens that need cataloguing at UC Berkeley's Essig Museum of Entomology is a ground beetle found by naturalist Charles Darwin, pictured, in 1833 . 'California has a rich history of insect collecting dating back to around 1900 and earlier,' said Gillespie, a professor in UC Berkeleyâs Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management. 'Through Calbug, our goal is to make at least some of those records, which are normally inaccessible to the public, available to people around the world. And by converting those labels into electronic records, it will be possible for us to track any changes in range for different species, and that provides insight into how animals react to changes in the environment.' Questions have been asked about the level of accuracy of the transcriptions entered by the citizen scientists. Researchers from the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History are working with Zooniverse to evaluate the cost, accuracy and speed of volunteer transcriptions from the Notes from Nature site. The site launched in beta in late April. The first 20,000 images, which included an insects like bombardier beetles and skipper butterflies. About a third of these records have already been transcribed by more than 2,000 users.","Handwritten field notes and insect specimens dating back hundreds of years need to be catalogued at University of California's Essig Museum of Entomology .

"'It's a scandal this man has had his extradition refused by a British court' says Gary McKinnon's mother Janis Sharp . By . James Slack . PUBLISHED: . 17:34 EST, 28 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:44 EST, 29 June 2012 . A notorious paedophile won his appeal against extradition to the US yesterday. Shawn Sullivan was reprieved by the same court that ruled Aspergerâs sufferer Gary McKinnon should be sent to America despite evidence he may kill himself. The 43-year-old Sullivan, who was on Interpolâs most-wanted list, is now free to walk our streets without supervision. Warped: Notorious paedophile Shawn Sullivan, left, won his appeal against extradition to the U.S. yesterday.Â  The same court ruled that Asperger's sufferer Gary McKinnon, right, should be sent to America despite evidence he may kill himself . High Court judges said a sex offenders' programme in Minnesota may have breached his human rights. Last night Garyâs mother, Janis Sharp, condemned the decision. âItâs a scandal this man has had his extradition refused by a British court, while my son who has been declared unfit for trial and at extreme risk of suicide by a Home Office-approved expert in assessing risk is still waiting,â she said. âTen years have passed waiting for his trauma and torment to come to an end.â David Bermingham, who was extradited to the US as one of the NatWest Three and has since written a book on extradition titled A Price to Pay, said: âThis case reveals at its starkest the idiocy of our extradition laws. âIt is shocking we continue to see a string of extradition cases of ordinary British citizens who have ostensibly none of the human rights that are now being invoked for a heavyweight criminal.â The UK cannot boot out Sullivan, who is a joint US/Irish citizen, because of his EU citizenship and his marriage to a Briton â a senior Ministry of Justice official he met in jail. Fuming: Gary McKinnon's mother Janis Sharp, pictured, condemned the decision last night, describing it as 'a scandal' He is wanted by the authorities in Minnesota over claims he raped a 14-year-old girl and molested two 11-year-olds almost two decades ago. An arrest warrant was issued in 1994 when a woman and her cousin accused him of exposing himself and sexually assaulting them in the city of Eagan. His 14-year-old alleged victim claims he plied her with alcohol and raped her when she passed out in the back of his car. Sullivan fled to Ireland where he married. While his Irish wife was pregnant, he was accused of sexually assaulting two 12-year-old girls in Dublin. He pleaded guilty but walked free with only a five-year suspended jail sentence, the Irish authorities being unaware of the US allegations. Sullivan then used his Irish ancestry to obtain an Irish passport in the name Sean OâSuilleabhain and went on the run around Europe for more than a decade. In 2007 he was arrested in Switzerland â but not detained â when he used an identity card with the original spelling of his name. Controversial: Shawn Sullivan, who is one of America's most wanted men, will be allowed to stay in the UK with his partner, 34-year-old MoJ policy manager Sarah Smith, pictured . The following year, Interpol added him to its most-wanted list and, when he moved to England, he was picked up by the Metropolitan Police Service in June 2010. He was living in Barnes, South-West London, with Sarah Smith, a 34-year-old Ministry of Justice policy manager. Since then he has been fighting extradition under a UK-US treaty that usually makes it very hard for any case to be thrown out. However his lawyers argued that sending him to Minnesota would be unfair because he might be placed on a life-long sex offender programme without even being convicted. On June 20, Lord Justice Moses and Mr Justice Eady agreed, saying there was a real risk Sullivan would be subjected to an order of civil commitment in âflagrant denialâ of his human rights. Article 5 of the Human Rights Act gives the right to liberty, unless removed by fair legal process.Lord Justice Moses said a criminal conviction was not necessary for enlistment on the programme â credible evidence of misconduct would do. Sullivanâs lawyer, Ben Brandon, said no one had been taken off Minnesotaâs sex offender treatment programme since it was revised in 1988. The two judges gave the US government a last opportunity to provide an assurance that no commitment order would be made. No such undertaking has been received and consequently Sullivanâs appeal under the 2003 Extradition Act was allowed yesterday. Aaron Watkins, appearing for the US government, had told the court that although Sullivan did not meet the programmeâs criteria there was no guarantee he would not be put on it. Sullivan was on remand in a category A prison in November 2010 when he wed Miss Smith in a civil ceremony witnessed by two prison officers. A judge later bailed Sullivan with an electronic tag. He will now be freed without any tag, or supervision, and will be required only to go on the sex offenders register. A Home Office spokesman said: âThe Court has found in this specific case that the possibility of civil commitment in Minnesota, following any custodial sentence, would breach Mr Sullivanâs human rights. âThe US has declined to provide assurances that he would not be subject to civil commitment. That is a matter for the US. âThis aspect of Mr Sullivanâs appeal was not against the decision of the Secretary of State to sign the extradition order.â British courts have ruled 46-year-old Gary from North London â wanted by the Americans for hacking into military computers while searching for evidence of âlittle green menâ â could be bundled off to America. His case is under review by Home Secretary Theresa May, who is examining medical evidence about his condition.","Shawn Sullivan was reprieved by the same .

The tycoon at the centre of the breast implant scandal has been charged with 'unintentional harming' and could still face manslaughter charges after being arrested by French police. Detectives seized Jean-Claude Mas, founder of Poly Implant Prothese, in a dawn swoop at his home in Six-Foursles-Plages, near Toulon. A former PIP director, Claude Couty, was also arrested in a raid on his home in nearby La Seyne-sur-Mer. Detained: Jean-Claude Mas, pictured this afternoon in a police car outside a Marseille police station, hours after he was arrested at his home . Raided: Police stand guard outside the home of Jean-Claude Mas' companion after he was arrested in an early-morning operation . The pair were questioned by detectives over the global health scare caused by a spate of ruptures of the cut-price implants. Following a day of interviews, Mas complained of heart problems but had . otherwise âbeen very cooperativeâ, his lawyer Yves Haddad said last night. He added that Mas had 'answered hundreds of questions about his responsibilityâ for . the scandal. He also confirmed Mas was charged with unintentional wounding and still faced a manslaughter case against him. Up to 500,000 women around the world . are believed to have received PIP implants, 40,000 of them British â . including thousands of breast cancer victims. Mas, 72, has not been seen in public . since the scandal surfaced last month. But he caused outrage when he . described women taking legal action against him as âmoney grabbersâ on . French radio. Arrested: Jean-Claude Mas was taken into custody today following a police raid at the million-pound villa in Six-Fours, close to Toulon . Affected: TOWIE star Lauren Pope (left), seen here in 2006, has been told she has PIP implants, while former glamour model turned bodybuilder Jodie Marsh (right) is waiting to find out if she received the faulty implants . Shut down: PIP closed in March 2010 after regulators found it was using a non-medical grade silicone in its implants . PIP was shut down and its products . banned in 2010 after it was revealed to have been using industrial-grade . silicone gel, which seemed to cause high rupture rates. Britain's department of health says . there is no 'urgent need' for the country's 50,000 women fitted with . PIP implants to have them removed. Around 3,000 of them were NHS patients who had the implants fitted after breast cancer surgery. All are filled with industrial . chemicals, including those used as fuel additives or for the manufacture . of industrial rubber tubing, and are liable to split open. Research suggests there is a 7 per cent rupture rate in Britain. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has . ordered a review of the data amid speculation he would order mass . removal of the implants, which were among the cheapest on the market. The British Association of Aesthetic . Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) says the implants are not fit to be in the . human body and so should be removed, whatever the rupture rate. France is paying up to Â£60million . for women to have the implants removed, with health secretary Xavier . Bertrand saying 'the gel used was truly contaminated'. An ITV News investigation revealed Mas . earned up to Â£180,000 a year from his company after it was launched in . 1991, despite warnings about the implants as early as 2005. Fears spread globally late last year after French health authorities advised 30,000 women to have PIP implants removed. Last night, British victims welcomed . the arrest.

For weeks before Isaac and Dakotah met, she had been asking her friends and pastor how to tell her son that he had a brother, but knew it had to be before the boys started school. They would be attending the same middle school in Washington, Missouri and would surely find out one way or another. The night after Isaac and Dakotah met, Isaac approached his mother and asked if he was adopted. When Ms Nolting, 42, asked why he thought that, her son responded: âBecause I think I found my brother.â Siblings: 'I could tell because of the nose,' said Dakotah Zimmer (middle, with siblings Ashley and Issac) of how he knew that a boy he had met by chance at the pool was actually his younger brother .

The 16-year-old mother had just given birth to Isaac nine days before, and also had a one-year-old son â Dakotah. Ms . Noltin had been a single mother herself, having her own daughter at 19. She told TODAY.com that her maternal instincts kicked in, and she . offered to take care of the newborn.

There's always been an unwritten rule that, if in a committed relationship, thou shalt not play tonsil-tennis with another person, allow them to put their hands or tongues on your body, nor put their bits anywhere near yours. The equation was simple: sex = infidelity. But now 'cheating' has taken on a whole new meaning, and it's mostly thanks to social media. Emotional infidelity - deep, passionate connections between people who often aren't even aware they've crossed the line from platonic friendship to romantic love - is turning out to be the biggest threat marriage has ever faced. Social media has blurred the definition of 'cheating', and just because you're not actually having sex with someone else doesn't mean you're not being unfaithful to your partner by flirting with other men . Facebook and Twitter, with their 'harmless' online flirtations, never-quite-forgotten old flame reunions and 'friends' who seem to care more about our lives than our partners, have made emotional cheating more possible . Emotional infidelity wasn't part of our grandparents' consciousness because the only member of the opposite sex available to flirt with was either your best friends' husband or your husbands' best friend. Infidelity rose sharply the second women swelled the workforce and expanded the choice of available extra-marital partners. Then along came Facebook and Twitter, and with it 'harmless' online flirtations, never-quite-forgotten old flame reunions ('It's just a coffee') and 'friends' who seem to care more about our lives than our partners. It's no wonder the lines of infidelity have blurred into a messy blob with which Rorschach would have had a heyday. Intense but invisible, erotic but unconsumed - emotional infidelity is dangerous, addictive and way too easy to get away with. With such blurry boundaries, it's hard to know what's acceptable and what's not. Are you an emotional cheat? Answer 'yes' to a few of the following and you're swimming in dangerous waters... Do you act available? The more you talk about your partner to others, the less available you'll seem . Do you share intimate details of your life with people you fancy? It's one thing dissecting relationships with same sex friends (or opposite sex friends if you're gay) but another discussing personal things with someone you've got a 'thing' for . It's usually women who are guilty of emotional cheating, since women get more emotionally involved and are keen to test it out, to see if this could be better than her current situation .

Emotional infidelity is intense, erotic, addictive and easy to get away with .
Eight questions to see if you are being emotionally unfaithful .
Do you talk negatively about your partner to a 'special' friend? You're effectively saying 'I could be lured away from this relationship because it's not ideal'.
Do you act available? The more you talk about your partner to others, the less available you'll seem. Conveniently forget to mention you're involved with someone and people will react to you as though you're single.
Do you have one rule for you, one rule for them? We all want our cake and to eat it too though we justify this by saying if we're flirting with someone, we know it's innocent. We're also very good at deluding ourselves something's innocent when it's not.
Do you regularly indulge in sexual fantasies about someone else? I don't actually think there's anything intrinsically wrong with being unfaithful in your head, but some experts say fantasy sex can make you want the person even more. The whole point of fantasies, after all, is to conjure up brilliantly perfect sex!
Do you keep secrets? Do you have secret email accounts, passwords and a lock on your phone? In an open, honest relationship, ideally no communication should be secret.
Do you share intimate details of your life with people you fancy? It's one thing dissecting and analyzing your relationships with same sex friends (or opposite sex friends if you're gay) but quite another discussing deeply personal things with someone you've got a 'thing' for. Emotional closeness swiftly moves into romantic dependence.
Are you female? It tends to be the woman who pushes the affair from friendship to love, from fantasy to actuality, according to psychologists. Women get more emotionally involved and are keen to test it out, to see if this could be better than her current situation.
Do you lie to your partner about seeing other people? If your partner's feeling a little threatened by the amount of time you're spending with your new best 'friend', do you continue seeing them and lie? A good question to ask to keep you on the straight and narrow: If my partner saw me right now, would they be upset? Would you be tempted to lie about what you're doing? If yes, stop it!"

A demure Duchess of Cambridge-type Cressida Bonas most definitely is not. Racy photographs have emerged of Prince Harryâs winsome girlfriend on the town, pictures she would probably rather his wider family didnât see. There she is on the pages of last weekâs Now magazine, hair in Heidi plaits, necking wine from a bottle, and downing something punchy from a shot glass. Prince Harry's party-loving girlfriend Cressida Bonas (left) is pictured downing alcohol from the bottle . Pictures of Cressida Bonas, such as this one in bunny ears, may cause alarm bells to ring at Buckingham Palace . In another photo, Cressida is running . both hands down a sun-tanned, bare male chest and kissing a blonde . female friend, who looks rather like her, on the lips. Or as Now . helpfully puts it: âBlondes together: Cressie smooches with a gal pal!â These unprincessy pictures are headlined âWhatever would the Queen say?â Well, . the Queen might muse she has been here before, when another raffish . âspareâ linked himself with an exuberant party girl from a . well-connected but very messy broken home. Think . back to the early Nineties and the endless headlines about Prince . Andrewâs wild bride, Sarah Ferguson, and it is easy to understand why . friends of Harry and William are asking if Cressie is the new Fergie. The . embarrassments which Fergie heaped upon the Royal Family are many and . cringe-worthy. Who can forget the infamous front page âtoe-suckingâ photographs with her American financial adviser Johnny Bryan in 1992? She had to flee Balmoral when the papers appeared. Playboy . princes, it has to be said, are naturally attracted to party girls, and . party girls can find it hard to fit in with the Windsors. Cressida is Blonde, bohemian and fun-loving, which is Harry's type but pictures of her such as the one left in a bikini and bright pink wig may cause concern . In this picture published in Now Magazine, she is seen stroking the chest of a half-naked man . The pictures of Cressida downing shots were taken before her relationship with Prince Harry began . Of course Cressidaâs youthful . indiscretions â it is not even clear how old these pictures are, but the . latest is probably from 2011 â can hardly be compared with Fergieâs, . who, at the point of the toe-sucking debacle, was already married with . two children and well into her 30s. These pictures were taken long . before Cressida was even a Royal girlfriend, let alone a wife, and she . may never even become one. Oddly enough, however, Fergie is . centre stage in this Royal romance. She is a friend of Cressidaâs . mother, Lady Mary Gaye Curzon, and Princess Eugenie introduced the . couple. And it is Fergie who . is said to have urged Harry to propose to Cressida, although given her . experience, you would think she would advise caution. Is this her way of . pitching herself, and her daughters, back into the centre stage of the . Royal Family? The romance . seems to be continuing apace. Harry has introduced Cressida to William . and Kate, and she has visited Kensington Palace many times. They have . been to Richard Bransonâs island of Necker together, not to mention the . ski resort, Verbier. The couple are both sporty,Â  outdoorsy types, and last week were spotted bowling at All Star Lanes in Bayswater. The . relationship looks like itâs getting serious, but Cressida herself is . said to think she is too young to marry yet. She is entitled to feel . hesitant about marriage because, like Fergieâs parents, her mother and . father have a spaghetti junction of marriages and affairs between them. Like . Fergie, her mother didnât make a smooth transition from single girl . about town to happily married woman. The blonde beauty, daughter of the . second wife of Earl Howe, a Conservative politician, was a socialite so . celebrated that Claridgeâs hotel named a cocktail after her. But she was married â and divorced â . four times. The first time she walked up the aisle she was 24, the age . Cressida is now. Cressidaâs father Jeffrey Bonas was husband number . three, and Lady Mary Gaye was his second wife. A judge branded Bonas . âuntrustworthyâ in his first divorce. Cressida was five when her parents . split. So back to the here . and now and those cringe-making photographs. If they look like . attention-seeking, we have to put them into context. Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson on their wedding day at Westminster Abbey about to walk down the aisle . Fergie is centre-stage in Prince Harry's romance as a friend of Cressida's mother . Larking . about for the cameras is all the rage among bright young things at the . moment, as the antics, to take an extreme example, of the ubiquitous . upper crust Burberry model Cara Delevingne (who bears a confusing . resemblance to family friend Cressida, being fair, pouty, willowy and . bushy-eyebrowed) prove. Cara is photographed pulling faces and . kissing girls â last week it was Sienna Millerâs turn, on the red . carpet at Cannes â on a daily basis. Unlike Cressida, she knows those . pictures will be everywhere. Even so, potential princesses arenât . usually caught smooching their friends. There . are hundreds of pictures of Cressida larking about on the web. For the . first time, we have a potential princess from the social networking, . picture-sharing generation. So thereâs Cressida in huge fluffy bunny . ears, Cressida in pink wigs with bikinis, and in fancy dress at her . sisterâs wedding celebrations in Africa and Hampshire. There is even one of her preparing to . smooch Princess Eugenie. Other than when she is skiing, she seems quite . resistant to full clothing, preferring tiny skirts, hot-pants and . anything that frees her midriff â though as a dancer, she has certainly . has the figure to wander around half-dressed. You . wouldnât have found any pictures like that of Kate Middleton before she . was married, although James and Pippa Middleton are happily cavorting . in cyberspace for eternity in bras and loo roll (her) and nearly naked . (him). James and Pippa . learned from their web exposure and have tried to be careful since. It . is possible â probable? â that unlike Fergie, Cressidaâs high jinks will . remind her she has to be more cautious now, and that there will never . be a Bonas indiscretion ever again. But she may decide she would rather be free to do what she likes. As Prince Harry is known for his love . of a wild night and his eagerness to shed his clothes, these pictures . illustrate exactly why Harry is so drawn to Cressida Bonas. He . has a type â like his long-term ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy, Cressida is a . red-blooded, bohemian blonde who likes a drink and a fag and a . knees-up. In this picture Cressida appears close to smooching another blonde on a night out . Princess Eugenie (left), pictured with her mother Sarah Ferguson and sister Princess Beatrice (right), introduced Prince Harry to Cressida . Prince Harry has a type and red-blooded, bohemian blonde who likes a drink and a fag and a knees-up . Demure types never attracted his Uncle Andrew either, whose pre-Fergie loves included soft porn star Koo Stark and model Katie Rabett. Harry likes blonde beauties with a . healthy dose of tomboy in their veins. With her fondness for trainers, . beanie hats and minimal make-up, thatâs Cressida. Certainly, after her . brush with the spontaneous, party-loving Fergie, who she adored before . it went so spectacularly wrong, the Queen âand Prince Philip â may feel a . little nervous at the thought of another fun-loving, free-spirited . exhibitionist entering their ranks. And . not only is Cressida a natural performer â she is studying dance at the . Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance â but she has been an . actress, too, playing an effective Desdemona in a production of Othello . at Leeds, and a string of lead parts in plays at her public school, . Stowe. She comes from a . family who lap up the limelight. There is actress half-sister Isabella, . who married Sam Branson in the most long-drawn out wedding of 2013. Sarah Ferguson was known as a wild bride who heaped embarrassments on Buckingham Palace . Prince Andrew previously dated actress Koo Stark, right, and model Katie Rabett, left . There is half-sister, Gabriella Wilde, a model and actress thrown out of Heathfield school for smuggling in vodka. There is her It-boy brother, Jacobi â like Harry, a polo-playing party boy who loves blondes. And there are her parents, with six marriages between them. On the other hand, most of these . pictures were taken a while back, when Cressida was at Leeds University. Leeds is notorious for its action-packed nightlife, something Cressida . fully appreciated back then. Her . university friend Jamie Laing, one of the âstarsâ of that insufferable . television show, Made In Chelsea, says they âpartied their way through . uniâ. The rich kids who date and dump each other on the Fulham/Chelsea . borders in the programme are very much Cressidaâs set. Friends . of Cressida have claimed she always preferred Leeds nightlife to . Londonâs because in London no one really âlets go.â Of course âletting . goâ is precisely what everyone in the Royal family is afraid of. Cressida has not made the same smooth transition into the public eye as Kate Middleton did . In Leeds, Cressida shared a house with five friends and liked going to see live music, festivals, and as a dance student, dancing, of course. Although she is four years Harryâs junior at 24, she is quite well travelled. She spent a year as a ski instructor and last summer went with her best friend to Australia after university. She waitressed on Bondi Beach and at one point she and her friend Georgia Forbes âcouchsurfedâ â moved around, staying on strangersâ sofas â with a man they met in a hotel. Then she came back to England and started her romance with Harry. All her friends say Cressida is sweet, calm and good-natured. She might grow up into a girl who feels she can handle the Royals, particularly with the equally free-spirited Harry by her side. So are the boozy antics little more than youthful over-exuberance, or is Cressida Bonas, Fergie number two? Only time will tell.","Pictures emerged of Cressida Bonas groping men and downing shots .

And now the jaw-dropping tweets - which began in August 2011 and now boast almost half a million followers - have been turned into a series of online comedy videos using puppets. Scroll down for video . The avatar for the Twitter account is Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein . The Twitter account - whose avatar is Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein - is used to relay all the arrogant, sexist, cynical, chauvinistic, conceited, self-important right-wing chatter claiming to have been heard not only in the lifts for the Wall Street bank, but also in corridors, meetings and at trader events. Snide remarks include: 'I say ""keep the change"" purely for my own convenience'; 'No one would run a marathon if they had to sign a confidentiality agreement first'; 'I don't care how hot she is, dumb is not sexy'; 'we have street cred on the only street that counts'; 'If someone asks you a question and you don't know the answer, belittle them. It's better to be an asshole than stupid' and 'If there really was a glass ceiling, we'd let all the women work above us'. There are also conversations heard between people, such as: '#1: George Bush spent 8 years putting a giant ""Kick Me"" sign on America's back, yet people blame Obama. #2: Do you work here?' CNBC has now turned the tweets into a series of videos starring puppet bankers . The tweets subscribe to the stereotypical belief that bankers are all smug, self-important and void of empathy . In an interview with theÂ New York Times, the anonymous tweeter behind the page said of his identity: 'Simply put, I am a banker who has some free time now that market volatility and the usual August summer lull has brought capital markets to a virtual halt. 'I am also someone who has long been cynical of the industry and the people that build their entire sense of self around it.' Explaining why he launched the account, he added: 'I wanted to amuse myself during the summer lull and while market volatility keeps capital markets transactions to a minimum. 'I also thought that despite the disdain out there that exists for Wall Street professionals, people still really have no idea really how bad it is - and how shallow the industry really is, and frankly, how unimpressive 98 per cent of the employees are.' The outrageous tweets are said to be written by a banker at Goldman Sachs . On the accompanying GSElevator wordpress site, the founder says he gets several tweets a day asking if the feed is fake, and wondering why, if the stories are true, bankers appear to have all their most outrageous conversations in lifts. To this he references the now-defunct Twitter account Conde Elevator, which relayed comments overheard in the lift for Conde Nast. He says: 'I have always said, to the extent that it isn't already totally obvious, that these aren't just elevators.

Craig Alexander, 32, has lost his Â£250,000 NHS job after it was discovered he had been convicted of armed robbery in 2007 . An NHS chief has been sacked from his Â£250,000-a-year job after it was revealed that he is aÂ  convicted armed robber. Craig Alexander was jailed after holding up a busy Tesco Express store at gunpoint in 2001 and threatening staff and customers before fleeing with almost Â£1,250 in cash and cheques. On his release he lied about his three-and-a-half-year stint in prison and was hired for the senior post of interim borough director at NHS Brent, where he was in charge of multi-million-pound taxpayer-funded budgets. By the time he was exposed, the 32-year-old had been handling the health serviceâs Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention programme in the north-west London borough for 17 months. His criminal past was revealed only after a member of staff who had complained about Alexanderâs rudeness at workÂ  looked him up online and discovered reports about the robbery. Questions are now being asked about why NHS bosses failed to carry out simple security checks on Alexander, of Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, who was dismissed last week. He was employed from last January through an agency and is believed to have taken home Â£1,000 a day â or about Â£250,000 a year. He had lied on his CV and also failed to reveal his criminal past in order to get the job. Alexander was working as interim borough director for NHS Brent, in north-west London, when his conviction was discovered. Pictured is NHS Brent's Wembley Centre for Health and Care . However, a simple Google search of his name quickly reveals newspaper reports on his sentencing, accompanied by his mugshot. A colleague, who did not want to be . named, said: âHe was in charge of the entire QIPP budget for the trust â . which runs into millions. 'He has been at Brent over a year. It is very . shocking that for a senior member of staff and in charge of budget . issues, no checks were done before he took up his position, and it took a . member of staff to find out about his past and report it to the . executive team.â An NHS Brent spokesman said: âThe person concerned was provided through a staffing agency. âWe have now terminated ourÂ  contract with the individual from the agency for failing to disclose a criminal conviction.â Alexander was 20 when he stole Â£1,140 . in cash and cheques worth Â£89.97 â later recovered â during the robbery . at the Tesco store in Byfleet, Surrey. He threatened two terrifiedÂ  cashiers, . telling them to hand over money from the till, and pointed a gun at . customers as he ordered them to get out. Alexander stole Â£1,140 cash and cheques worth Â£89.97 after he robbed the Tesco Express in Byfleet, Woking, on October 12, 2001 . But Alexander managed to escape . justice for six years and had been carving out a successful career as an . NHS project manager until new evidence linked him to the convenience . store robbery. Police took his DNA and fingerprints . when he was arrested for a separate offence in 2007 and were able to . link him to prints found on a gun dumped near the Tesco hold-up. Further tests were then conducted on clothing recovered from the scene, including a stocking which had been used as a mask. Saliva on the stocking was also matched to Alexander. Alexander admitted armed robbery at . Guildford Crown Court in September 2007 and was jailed for three and a . half years. During the sentencing, the judge said he had taken into . account the fear of the shoppers in the store at the time, and felt a . custodial sentence was the only punishment.

'Callous': Michelle Christie, pictured after having her head shaved for charity, stole more than Â£9,000 from her 95-year-old neighbour . A charity fund-raiser offered to help care for a 95-year-old neighbour then stole Â£9,000 from his life savings. 'Callous' Michelle Christie, 41, who was paid Â£15 per week to collect Peter MacKinnon's pension and help with odd jobs around his house in Elgin, Scotland, used the elderly man's Post Office card and PIN number to steal from him over a period of six months, a court heard. Christie, who once shaved her head for charity and was well-known in the area for her fundraising efforts, pleaded guilty to stealing from the pensioner at Elgin Sheriff Court yesterday.

She said Christie offered to help care for her elderly uncle when he fell ill at the end of last year, but it later emerged that money was disappearing from Mr McKinnon's bank account. Neighbour Amanda Sim, 27, contacted police after she became suspicious of Christie. 'We were all shocked, first of all that she would do that to him, and more so shocked at the substantial amount she took,' Mrs Sim said. 'She was making out she was doing good for Peter, but all along she was stealing his money. 'Peter . still says ""I'm just lost for words"".

'Shocked': Christie, 41, seen ahead of the charity head shave, was well known in Elgin for her fund-raising efforts, the court heard . Ms Thompson, who lives in England but visits her uncle in Elgin every few months, said: 'I have never known such a callous human being who makes herself out to be a charitable person whilst at the same time robbing a poor pensioner.'

Career criminal: Robert Knowles who has 330 convictions and has appeared in court every year since 1959 . A prolific shoplifter wasÂ  yesterday convicted of his 330th offence â as it emerged he has appeared in court every year since 1959. Robert Knowles, 66, first broke the law when he was aged just 13, and has been adding to his criminal record ever since. He was sent to a correctional school in 1959 and has been back in court 183 times over the subsequent 54 years. His lawyer told the court he has become âinstitutionalisedâ and steals so he can be returned to prison on his release. Knowles has now been handed another prison sentence after taking two bottles of wine and three tins of fish worth a total of Â£14.15 from a Tesco Metro. Judge Paul Darlow jailed the alcoholic for 123 days at Plymouth Crown Court â but because he has spent 61 days in custody already he was immediately released. Knowles, from Plymouth, will remain on probation and receive help from social services. The Crown Prosecution Service said afterwards it was unable to provide a full breakdown of his lifetime of offending because manyÂ  of the crimes pre-dated its creation in 1986. Last year Knowles was jailed for stealing whisky miniatures the day after finishing a spell in prison. Plymouth Crown Court heard the crook had Â£160 in his pocket at the time â and knew perfectly well he would be sent back to jail. Recorder Robin Belben told him at last Octoberâs hearing: âYou have been caught in a revolving door over the last two or three years. âYou commit an offence, you go to prison â and you commit another as soon as you are released.â Knowles is said to be âresigned to spending the rest of his life in prisonâ because he is unable to cope with living outside prison. He typically steals something of low value every time he is released from jail, in an apparent attempt to get himself locked up again. Serial offender: Knowles, 66, appeared before Judge Paul Darlow at Plymouth Crown Court - four years after the same judge had 'congratulated' him on clocking up 170 court appearances . In June 2011 Knowles admitted the theft of two bottles of whisky, watches and socks worth Â£279 from Marks and Spencer. Worst offender: David Archer, 58, who has clocked up 342 convictions . During that hearing at Plymouth magistratesâ court his solicitor Alan Harris said: âHe can cope very easily with prison but cannot cope very well with the world outside. 'This is as bleak a plea and mitigation as this court can ever wish to hear.â Knowles left prison six months later and committed another shoplifting offence within a week, this time stealing a watch, sunglasses, underwear and socks worth Â£79. * One in three criminals is a serial offender with at least 15 convictions. There are more than 100,000 such criminals, 50 per cent more than a decade ago, official figures reveal. Ministry of Justice figures published yesterday showed there were 302,940 offenders given a caution or conviction in 2012. Of those some 34 per cent had at least 15 previous cautions or . convictions on their record â or more than 102,000 individuals.

A man whose nose was bitten off by a vicious dog said he 'wants justice' after authorities failed to destroy the animal. Jimmy Rogers, 23, has been left with a gaping hole on his face after the dog turned on him and ripped out the bridge of his nose. The three-year-old dog is believed to be a cross between a pit bull and an American bulldog; pit bull-type dogs are banned in Ontario, where the attack happened. Jimmy Rogers has been left with a gaping hole in his face after a vicious dog ripped the bridge of his nose off as he sat in his front porch . The unemployed construction worker, from Oshawa, on Lake Ontario, Canada, told the Toronto Sun: 'I want justice. My nose has been ripped off and I donât want this to happen to someone else.' Jimmy was relaxing in the front porch of his home with his girlfriend Sjaana Farrant, 23, when the attack happened. The un-muzzed dog, named Polo, belonged to his neighbour's brother. As they walked past Jimmy's porch, Polo suddenly turned on him and launched itself at his head. To protect his girlfriend, Jimmy grabbed the dog but the animal bit down on his dose, tearing away the bridge. This is the last thing Jimmy remembers about the attack. Banned: America pit bulls like this one, which Jimmy says is similar to the dog that attacked him, are banned in Ontario . Surgeons had to take a skin graft from Jimmy's leg to cover the open wound where his nose used to be. Part of his nostrils have been saved, but it will take more operations to rebuild his nose using bone taken from his wrist. Traumatised after the harrowing ordeal, Jimmy has spoken out about what he says is a lax enforcement of Ontario's ban on pit bulls. He told the Toronto Sun that Oshawa authorities were failing to take Ontario's pit bull ban seriously; he claimed the dog should be destroyed. Animal services in Oshawa seized the dog after the attack, but according to the local news service, it will be released within the week with nothing more than a muzzle order. Ontario's laws ban pit bulls, which includes: pit bull terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers, American pit bull terriers, or 'a dog that has an appearance and physical characteristics substantially similar to any of those dogs'. Quoted in the article, Bill Slute, animal services manager, says Polo was registered as an American Bulldog.

A cancer survivor who lost his eye and jaw to the disease has had his face rebuilt by surgeons - using parts of his thigh and shoulder. Josh Stephenson, 48, was diagnosed with a rare form of eye cancer - malignant orbital melanoma - in October 2009. The designer was treated with radiotherapy in early 2010, but the cancer spread to his face and doctors were forced to operate. Josh lost his jaw and eye to cancer and had his face extensively rebuilt during surgery over two days (pictured with his mother Pat, right) Josh with the signs of a malignant melanoma visible in his left eye. He was diagnosed in October 2009 . Surgeons operated on Mr Stephensonâs face during two full-day surgeries four months apart in 2010. In the first they removed his eye and replaced it with thigh tissue. During the second they removed his upper left jaw and . part of the roof of his mouth and rebuilt it using part of his shoulder blade. Mr Stephenson has undergone around 50 hours of surgery during seven operations and faces further procedures. Despite his harrowing ordeal, the former luxury designer with Harrods is determinedly upbeat. 'You just have to get on with it,' he told Mail Online. 'It's been a journey and although my . face looks a bit of a mess, it's a work in progress. Each procedure . makes it look a little bit better.' He added that support from his team of doctors, family and friends had been essential. 'Without them I donât know what I would have done,' he said. Mr Stephenson, from Cambridge, first noticed something was wrong when the skin around his eye became itchy. He . thought it was just hayfever, but when his eyelid became swollen he was . referred to a specialist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. Doctors . believe Mr Stephenson may have had his cancerous freckle at the back of his . eyeball since birth and it had been growing slowly into a tumour ever . since. Mr Stephenson believes stress could be an important factor in triggering his condition. Josh undergoing treatment for a maligmant melanoma behind his left eye . Josh had a malignant melanoma removed from behind his left eye before his face was rebuilt using skin tissue, muscle and arteries . Mr Stephenson said: 'I was devastated when I was . first diagnosed with cancer. But thanks to the skills of wonderful . surgeons I am still here. 'I am so grateful for the treatment that saved my life. Sadly, however, not everyone survives.' Mr Stephenson, who is being monitored twice a year by the oncology department at Addenbrookeâs Hospital, Cambridge, said his doctors are happy with his progress. 'They say my skin has healed incredibly well,' he said. 'The sensations have been very odd though. Sometimes it feels like pins and needles, other times I get a ""pressing-in"" feeling or numbness. 'It can be tricky with one eye in crowded spaces as well.' Mr Stephenson is currently in remission although he is aware the cancer could return. 'It can always come back if it has been in the lymph nodes,' he said. 3D render of Josh's skull: This computer model shows the section of skull removed (green), the piece of shoulder blade (red) used to re-create his cheek bone and the metal sockets (blue) in which false teeth are to be attached . Josh's recovery is being monitored twice a year at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. His new tissue is slowly grafting onto his face . Next month he will have another operation that will remove some of the skin from inside his mouth, which will make it easier for him to eat and speak. Surgeons will also fill in a bit more of his face using some fat taken from his stomach and replacing his temporary teeth with permanent implants. He said: 'There will be different experts working on my mouth and eye at the same time.' Mr Stephenson is keen to raise awareness for both Cancer Research UK and the charity Saving Faces, who have both provided him with support during his three-year ordeal. He said: 'I . not only lost my jaw and eye, which was upsetting enough, but I also . lost my income after the diagnosis. It left me out of work and I . received no benefits.

Police investigating the deaths of a devout Catholic mother and her two young children in an affluent suburb of St. Louis have backtracked on an earlier suggestion that the tragedy was the result of a murder-suicide. Officers arrived at the large house in the community of Glendale, Missouri after 11 a.m on Monday and found the bodies of Catherine Murch, 42, and her children in different parts of the home. Police originally concluded that Murch shot her 10-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter before taking her own life while her husband, Mitch Murch II, was reading a book in a room downstairs. Tragic: Cathy Murch and her children, Mitch and Mary Claire, were found shot dead at their home by husband Mitch Murch. Police originally thought it was a murder-suicide but have now backtracked . However, officials have since made a . U-turn in the investigation, backing away from the initial . murder-suicide theory and announcing that it is too early to draw any . conclusions. Glendale . police Lt. Tim Fagan said Mr Murch has been interviewed and is . cooperating with investigators, and said police 'don't consider him a . suspect'. Fagan said Mr Murch's 911 calls and his . account of the incident appear to line up with the evidence gathered so . far at the scene. On Tuesday, police removed at least three rifles from the home marked with evidence tags. Officials are still waiting for results of crime lab tests to determine . who fired the murder weapon. Also pending are autopsy results and more interviews . with those connected with the case, according to CBS St. Louis. Friends, neighbours and a police source told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Mrs Murch had battled depression for years - but the police chief would not comment on the claims. Killed: Young Mitch was found shot in a downstairs room while Mary Claire was found dead upstairs . Picture perfect: Friends and relatives flocked to an impromptu prayer service for the family on Monday night where they expressed their shock at the deaths of Cathy, left, Mary Claire, right, and young Mitch . Mitch Murch, 43, had also been terminated from his job in the marketing department of Centaur Building Services on July 1, the company's chief financial officer, Paul Simons, told the Post-Dispatch. 'The whole company is in shock over this; Mitch was well-respected here,' Simons said, but would not offer any further details about why Murch left. He had alerted authorities after finding the bodies Monday morning. He told officials he heard a gunshot, but thought that it came outside the house, 'so he ran to his front door and saw that his wife was laying in the kitchen, his son was laying in a side room and his daughter was on a bed in the second story of the home,' Glendale police Sgt. Bob Catlett said. The case squad issued a news release Tuesday saying that it had assigned more than 20 investigators to the case. Fagan said the size of the probe was necessary to 'get a very clear understanding of what happened'. During a press conference on Tuesday, Fagan declined to address reports that Mrs Murch had been suffering from depression, or speculate whether the family had been experiencing marital or financial problems that would have explained the shootings. Investigators did point out that there have been no previous calls to the home for any type of domestic disturbances. Site of tragedy: The Murches lived in a well-appointed two-story brick house situated on a tree-lined street in the suburb of Glendale . Devastating scene: The body of Cathy Murch was discovered on the floor in the kitchen, while her children's bodies were found in a side room and in a second-floor bedroom . Yellow crime tape cordoned off the family's stately four-bedroom home which is located on what one neighbor described to Fox2Now as the 'primo street in Glendale' â an affluent community about 10 miles from St. Louis.Â  Court records show the Murches bought the home for $764,900 in 2007. People . close to the family said the parents were devoted to their children and . the Catholic Church. According to police, the father called and reported one gunshot at 10:57 a.m. He then called back sometime later and told a dispatcher that his wife was dead and he thought it was a murder-suicide. When EMS arrived on the scene, they found Mr Murch performing CPR on his son. The boy and his sister, Mary Claire, were taken to area hospitals where they were pronounced dead. Catherine Murch was pronounced dead at the scene. Police recovered a weapon from inside the home, but said no apparent suicide note was found. Neighbors who gathered outside the . family's home surrounded by a manicured lawn and nestled in lush . shrubbery and flowers were shocked by the scene. Hidden problems? The Murches' acquaintances described them as devout Catholics who seemed happy, although one person said the mother appeared distraught just days before the tragedy . 'We . have a very nice neighborhood; no problems at all, but then you hear . this and it hurts that this close it happened,' Phillip Henderson told . the station KMOV. Henderson . and his wife, Pat, said their neighbor talked to Mrs Murch just days . before the incident and something seemed not right. 'She . did say she recently talked to the mother and asked well how are things . going, she said, ""Ugh, well you know"",' said Henderson. 'So maybe . something's going on there she didn't know.' Records show Catherine Murch graduated from the University of Missouri in 1992 with a degree in political science and received a nursing degree from Saint Louis University in 1994. Online records indicate she was a registered nurse. Mitch Murch, 43, graduated from the University of Missouri, also in 1992. He owns a maintenance management company and is director of a business called The Maids International in Omaha, Nebraska, a cleaning company franchise, according to online records. He has also previously worked as vice president to facilities management firms, and for Mitch Murch's Maintenance Management - a facilities company founded by his father and run by his brother. Torn apart: Mitch Murch II, right, told police he heard a gunshot and found his wife, second right, and their two children dead . Mrs Murch trained as a nurse and . aided with clinical trial research. She was working as a Treatment . Educator at Special Design Healthcare, according to her LinkedIn page. The family was involved at Mary Queen . of Peace Church in nearby Webster Groves, where the mother frequently . volunteered in the parish elementary school where her two children went. The father also headed an anti-abortion . initiative called the Respect Life Apostolate at the church, and the . pastor said the family appeared to be a happy one. Rev. Bob Reiker added: 'Weâre just trying to piece it together and come to grips.' Following the tragedy, the church staff . said in a statement: âWe are shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic . loss of life involving a family in one of our parish communities. 'Mary Queen of Peace Pastor Fr. Bob . Reiker and Associate Pastor Fr. Craig Holway are working with grieving . family members and the MQP parish family to cope with the aftermath of . this tragedy.' Religious: The Murches were involved in Mary Queen of Peace Church, where the husband headed a pro-life initiative . Strong connection: Both Murch children attended the Mary Queen of Peace parish school where their mother helped parents of new students . Hundreds turned out for an impromptu hour-long prayer service at Mary Queen of Peace in Webster Groves held for the family on Monday night. Rev. Reiker thanked the crowd during the service, adding: I thought we'd have maybe a dozen people or so. 'But this is proof how much people in our community care. May the Lord be with Mitch and his family and all those who are grieving.' Craig Avery and his children attended the service and knew the family; Avery said his children attended camp with Mary Claire last week. 'I'm going to miss her so much,' one of his daughters told the Webster Groves Patch.","Mitch Murch II called police and said his wife and two children were dead .

"By . Jessica Satherley . UPDATED: . 09:49 EST, 13 December 2011 . A former military pilot has taken to New York City's streets in this Transformers costume he made himself out of household items. Peter Kokis, 49, has spent 675 hours meticulously creating 'Brooklyn Ironhide' - 164lb body suit replica of Transformers leader Optimus Prime. It is made from hundreds of random domestic items including spatulas, toothbrush holders, sewing machine parts, toilet brushes and even a pooper scooper. Transformer fan: Peter Kokis, 49, has spent 675 hours meticulously creating 'Brooklyn Ironhide' out of household items from his New York home . The Autobot fan now travels around his home city of New York attending corporate and public events and greeting stunned members of the public. Peter came up with the inventive idea in 2008 when he was invited to a sea-themed fancy dress party. He spent hours creating a cross between Optimus Prime and a squid using small household tools sold in convenience stores. 'Brooklyn Ironhide' is not an exact replica of the Transformers character Optimus Prime, but it is his own creation inspired by the Transformers characters . After getting pats on the back for his efforts, Peter decided to build a full exoskeleton based on Optimus Prime. Proud artist: Peter now attends private and corporate parties and promotional events as the Autobot . Inspired creation: Peter's Autobot (left) was inspired by Optimus Prime (right) from the Transformers series . He has now built four - including this original creation, the incredible Brooklyn Ironhide. The suit's items also include two hockey leg guards, six radiator knobs, a number of sewing machine parts and even two shoehorns. His shins are large pooper scoopers, there are a number of bird feeders over the body and each cannon has a toilet brush holder on it. He said: 'No single part of any of my exoskeletons is particularly expensive, but all those little parts add up, even though many come from cheap discount stores. 'Sometimes I see something - a paper towel holder, a soap dish, contact lens case, whatever - and I immediately know what I want to do with it. 'Other times I see something and am struck by its interesting shape, and I buy it for some future use, or the part doesn't work out so I throw it away.' It took the 49-year-old 600 hours over a 13 month period to create Brooklyn Ironhide - and even then he wasn't happy with the final results. Meeting his fans: Peter says 'little kids are in awe of the Transformer, sometimes hugging at the legs and screaming they love me' So he went back to the drawing board and spent a further 75 hours perfecting the armoured suit, which has cost 'thousands' of dollars in total. The artist and sculptor now attends private and corporate parties and promotional events as the Autobot through his company Brooklyn RobotWords - as well as meeting members of the public while suited up. He said: 'It is a very physically and emotionally exhausting endeavour. Performing in very heavy, unventilated suit of armour is quite challenging at 49, so I have to spend a lot of time in the gym. 'Little kids are in awe of the Transformer, sometimes hugging at the legs and screaming they love me. 'The little ones who have seen the films and comics often think I'm real - although I can't imagine what it must be like for a four-year-old old when Brooklyn Ironhide is standing over him. 'I was recently dressed as Ironhide and with a boy who was about four when his six-year-old older sister started throwing rocks at me to protect him. I thought that was cool. 'Dogs usually growl at me, though the other day I had a dog licking Bumblebee's face.'","Former military pilot spent thousands of dollars to create Brooklyn Ironhide out of household items .

Condemned: The MoD magazine that includes the advert for payday loans from Forces Loans, a company charging an APR of more than 3,300 per cent . The Ministry of Defence was condemned last night for cashing in on the debts of its poorest soldiersÂ  by selling advertising space in its staff magazine to a payday loans company. For an undisclosed fee, Forces Loans, which charges an APR of more than 3,300 per cent, is promoting its loans in Defence Focus â a magazine published by the MoD and read by British troops worldwide. The revelation comes as Army commanding officers are expressing concern about the numbers of soldiers getting into debt, and when thousands of troops are expecting to be made redundant in the latest round of job cuts. A new recruit to the Army earns less than Â£14,000 and a private is paid just under Â£18,000. Debt campaigners â such as the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Labour MP Stella Creasy â have called for the introduction of legislation to cap the rates charged to soldiers on short-term loans atÂ  six per cent. When told about Forces Loansâ adverts appearing in Defence Focus, Ms Creasy told The Mail on Sunday: âAt the end of 2011 I received assurances the Government was taking the issue of payday loan companies targeting soldiers very seriously. âTo find out a year later the MoD is making money from this situation is shocking. These loans are toxic for family finances. One in three payday loans is taken out to payÂ  off another. âI am horrified and I will be demanding answers. Only last week I was approached by a senior Army officer urging me to do more to highlight the issues. âThe MoD shouldnât be lending these companies a veneer ofÂ  respectability. I would expect a greater duty of care towards military personnel. Their pay varies considerably depending on whether they are deployed overseas.â The MoD has admitted accepting Forces . Loansâ advertisements since mid-2012. The advert in the December/January . edition of Defence Focus offers cash loans designed exclusively for . soldiers. Concern: The loans revelation comes as Army commanding officers are expressing concern about the numbers of soldiers getting into debt and thousands of troops are expecting to be made redundant . The advert carries the codeword âMILâ that soldiers can use to gain access to the Forces Loans website. Another code is required to access the page offering similar deals to police officers and support staff. Forces Loans claims it is the No 1 lender to the military. Its website sets out the terms for an immediate loan of up to Â£1,000 paid directly into a customerâs bank account without any credit checks taking place. The basic amount repayable on Â£1,000 is Â£1,250 â if the money is repaid within 31 days. This is an APR of 1,284 per cent based onÂ  31 days, but the amount can increase significantly if soldiers fail to pay up within the agreed period. Forces Loans is a private company founded in 2004. According to Companies House records, Forces Loansâ accounts have been dormant since 2006. The Office of Fair Trading confirmed that Forces Loans renewed its consumer credit licence number in October 2012. Last night, Defence Minister Andrew Robathan thanked The Mail on Sunday for highlighting issues surrounding Forces Loans. He promised the companyâs adverts would not appear again. He said: âI am grateful to you for raising this matter. While we do not wish to restrict the private lives of defence personnel, we do not want to be seen to support them taking out such expensive loans. âI donât think such an advert should appear in Defence Focus and it will not in the future. I would not want any soldier being charged such a rate of interest on a loan. This is not healthy. I can see the spiral of debt into which they could fall.â The Mail on Sunday approached Forces Loans and its director,Â  Neville Gothold, for a comment.

A third man has been arrested in connection with the death of off-duty police officer PC Gareth Francis, who died after an assault in Edgeley, Manchester . An off-duty policeman attacked on a night out died from a head injury as a result of a single punch. Three men continue to be questioned on suspicion of the murder of PC Gareth Francis, 28, in Stockport, Greater Manchester, as a post-mortem examination confirmed the cause of death. Police and emergency services were called at 1.20am yesterday to a report of an assault in Castle Street, Edgeley, where PC Francis was found with a serious head injury. He had been walking home after being dropped off by taxi from a night out in Manchester with friends when he was attacked. Paramedics treated him at the scene and he was taken by ambulance to Stepping Hill Hospital, where he died shortly afterwards. Two men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested on suspicion of murder after the incident in Stockport in the early hours of Sunday. Police said today that a third man, aged 20, had also been arrested on suspicion of murder after handing himself in at a police station last night. All three are from the Stockport area and remain in custody for questioning. Itâs understood football fan PC Francis had been on a night out with friends in Manchester celebrating Manchester Cityâs win against Fulham at the Etihad stadium. The group caught a taxi back to Stockport and the officer, who served with Greater Manchester Police, was attacked in Castle Street, Edgeley, just minutes after buying food at a takeaway. PC Francisâs family paid tribute to him in a statement, saying: 'Our gorgeous son brought love and laughter into not only our lives, but he was an amazing brother, boyfriend, grandson and nephew. 'We cannot imagine how we can face each day knowing that he is gone from our lives.' Chief Supt Chris Skyes described him as 'a dedicated officer' who will be sadly missed by his colleagues. Ian Hanson, chairman of Greater Manchester Police Federation, added: 'Gareth was a much-loved and well respected member of the GMP family. We are all distraught at this news. 'His team are devastated.' The scene in Edgeley, Stockport, after off-duty police officer Gareth Francis was murdered in the early hours of Sunday . PC Francis's immediate supervisor for . the last four years, Sergeant Alex Cairns, spoke of him as 'a . consummate professional police officer'. Sgt Cairns said: 'Gareth's colleagues . on 'A' relief are absolutely devastated by his death. It has hit them . extremely hard and they are being offered all the support that we can . right now. 'Most of his career, Gareth worked on . a close-knit relief of between 10 and 14 officers, so you can imagine . that in teams of that size the news has come as a personal blow to them. 'Gareth was the kind of officer who . would quietly get on with his job with the minimum of supervision. 'In . fact, he was pretty much a 'go to' kind of guy. If you needed something . doing quietly and efficiently, then he was your man. He would volunteer . to stay late without any complaint and approached everything in work . with an outstandingly positive attitude. 'All of his colleagues, without . exception, felt a sense of relief when they knew Gareth would be . attending a difficult or potentially dangerous incident with them. That . was the esteem in which his fellow officers held him. He was always the . consummate professional police officer. 'One measure of his professionalism . came one day when a colleague approached me and said Gareth had broken . his hand but was determined to carry on working. I sent him to hospital, . of course, but had I not been told about his hand, Gareth would not . have mentioned it.' Mr Francis had been dropped off with . his friends in Edgeley, Stockport, by a taxi moments after a group of . âdrunken and rowdyâ men were thrown out of a nearby pub. The . two groups crossed paths and, after a row between one of PC Francisâs . friends and a man from the other group, a fight broke out. Witnesses . said PC Francis appeared to try to calm the situation by standing in . the middle of the two groups when he was punched in the head and . immediately fell to the ground. Emergency services arrived within minutes and discovered PC Francis with a serious head injury. He was taken to hospital in an ambulance and died later the same day. Yesterday the area where PC Francis, from Stockport, fell was cordoned off. Local Joe Taylor said: âIt is absolutely pathetic and disgusting. These men had been chucked out of the pub because they were causing trouble and arguing with everyone. âThe next thing we knew there was loads of noise in the street and we saw them grappling with each other and then we heard people screaming that this poor young man was on the floor. 'We heard that he had come in between them and one of the lads punched him in the head and he fell almost immediately. Itâs terrible.â Scroll down for footage from the scene . Three men in their 20s from the Stockport area have been arrested on suspicion of murder .

"By . James Forsyth . PUBLISHED: . 17:07 EST, 2 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:07 EST, 2 February 2013 . Crunch time: David Cameron is desperate for a majority of Conservatives to back his plans for gay marriage . Few votes have set Tory MP against Tory MP as bitterly as this Tuesdayâs vote on gay marriage. Thereâs even dark speculation in the tea rooms that those with skeletons in their cupboard who vote against will find these skeletons tumbling out on to the front pages. A growing number of MPs are simply refusing to discuss the matter with their colleagues. It is a free vote, meaning Tory MPs are â officially â allowed to vote however they want. The Bill will comfortably pass through the Commons given the vast majority of Liberal Democrat and Labour MPs who are in favour of it. However, everyone knows that Downing Street would love a majority of Tory MPs to back it and is desperate to avoid a majority opposing it. They are pulling out the stops to try to get this result. Cameronâs two closest Cabinet allies have been deployed, with Michael Gove making the case to the public in this newspaper and George Osborne trying to talk round wavering MPs. Behind the scenes, others are being more direct, arguing that given the pace of change no one who opposes this measure will ever become party leader. At the moment, those counting the Tory votes for Noâ10 expect it to be very close. They predictÂ  120 for it, 120 against and 60 abstentions. Only one Tory Cabinet Minister is certain to oppose the measure, the Environment Secretary Owen Paterson. The party leadership expects Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and possibly one other Secretary of State to abstain. However, they are hopeful that the socially conservative former leader Iain Duncan Smith will come out for gay marriage. As someone close to Cameron says: âThe size of this rebellion really does matter.â The vote will be seen as an indicator of Tory dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. One of those set to vote against it says: âIt is a good way to show we are fed up without defying the whip.â Close race: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, left, is expected to abstain from the vote but Iain Duncan Smith may come out in favour of gay marriage . The number of Tory MPs in the No camp appears to have risen in line with the mutinous chatter. Some MPs are furious with the leadership for raising this issue. One senior opponent of gay marriage complains: âIt has split the Conservative party and made us all out to be gay-bashers.â So why is Cameron doing this? Many suggest it is because he wants to demonstrate his 21st Century credentials. But those who know the Prime Minister best claim the reason is simpler. âHe really believes it,â says one gay colleague, who has discussed the issue with him extensively. It is hard to overstate how enthusiastic Cameron is about marriage. Even as Prime Minister, he takes the time to write long, personal letters to friends and staff who are heading down the aisle. One divorcee in his circle refers, only half-jokingly, to him as âthe marriage policeâ. A Tory in a civil partnership remarks: âIf this passes, David will insist we all get married.â Cameron and his intellectual ally Steve Hilton have wanted to back gay marriage since he became leader in 2005. So what held them back? The plan was to introduce it at the same time as marriage tax breaks. But this idea has fallen foul of austerity. In recent weeks, more than one Cabinet Minister has urged a revival of this plan. Noâ10 has refused, for fear of looking as if it has been pushed into it by Tory concerns over gay marriage. This is a major strategic misjudgment. For without this something blue, Cameron will be jilted at the altar on Tuesday night by his party when he asks them to vote for something new. Lost her shine: Cabinet minister Justine Greening . Eighteen months ago, Justine Greening was one of the Governmentâs rising stars. But since her elevation to the Cabinet, she has lost the confidence of Noâ10. They believe that if she had not been moved from Transport in the autumn reshuffle, she would have been forced to resign over the flawed West Coast Main Line franchising decision. Aides were also concerned by her refusal to offer Andrew Mitchell âÂ  her predecessor as International Development Secretary â official help for a Select Committee appearance to defend Government policy on Rwanda. With Mitchell on the road to political rehabilitation, thereâs speculation he will return to his old department at the next reshuffle. But in the current febrile atmosphere, the Prime Minister might not want to jettison any Cabinet Minister â let alone one who used to share an office with Boris Johnson. It has been a torrid few days for the Tories. But one thing is cheering up Cameronâs foot soldiers: Lynton Crosby isÂ  back working for the party. Crosby, the straight-talking Australian strategist who steered Boris Johnson to victory in London twice and ran the Tory General Election campaign in 2005, has been making his presence felt this week. Last Wednesday he addressed the 1922 Committee and received a desk-banging reception after his declaration that the party didnât have to choose between securing its base and reaching out to new voters. Rousing: Campaign manager Lynton Crosby has been making his presence felt among Tories this week . On Thursday Crosby addressed Tory special advisers at HQ, stressing the importance of ramming home the partyâs message. But many in government think that Crosbyâs discipline is neededÂ  not at HQ â but inside Noâ10. They complain that, absurdly, the PM is now selecting when individual news announcements should be made. There is also frustration at how so many of the policies meant to come out of the mid-term review have yet to be finalised. One exasperated source says, âYou canât get a decision on anythingâ out of Downing Street. The Tories are trying to move on to an election footing. ButÂ  the campaign machine can only be as good as the policy material it is working with â and thatÂ  will require Noâ10 to take some real decisions. Every February, the same problem comes around for George Osborne: bonuses at the state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland. Inside the Treasury, there is a sense of resignation. One source says; âIt is going to be hot politically but thereâs not much we can do.â Some of those close to the Chancellor hope that the improving stock market will enable him to start selling off the stateâs 82 per cent stake in RBS before too long. It would certainly be a bonus for Osborne if he could avoid another round of controversy in February 2015, which will be just three months before polling day.","Vote on same sex marriage set to split Tory party in Commons vote .

Primark showed yesterday that it is not all doom and gloom on the high street as it delivered bumper Christmas sales figures. The discount fashion chain was the star performer over the festive period as others around it collapsed into administration. The good news was echoed at Argos while soaring sales of tablet computers helped Currys and PC World to a bumper Christmas. Success: Primark showed yesterday that it is not all doom and gloom on the high street as it delivered bumper Christmas sales figures . Primark bosses hinted that the chain had won yet more middle-class customers from troubled rival Marks & Spencer. Shoes, scarves, Christmas-themed jumpers and âonesiesâ helped Primark to a 9 per cent rise in sales, excluding recently opened stores. When the groupâs 14 store openings in Europe, including its second shop on Oxford Street in central London, are taken into account the figures are even better. There was a 25 per cent increase in total sales at the chain over the 16 weeks to January 5, compared with the same period of 2011-2012. This was a much stronger performance than M&S which disappointed with a 3.8 per cent fall in clothing sales compared with the same period of the year before. Its boss, Marc Bolland, refused to slash prices in an attempt to boost profit and shoppers flocked to other cheaper chains such as Primark. Boost: The good news was echoed at Argos while soaring sales of tablet computers helped Currys and PC World to a bumper Christmas . John Bason, finance director of Primarkâs parent company Associated British Foods, said: âIt has wide appeal for Middle England and is as popular with young people and across all socio-economic groups. âPrimark has a wide range of prices and items on offer so to try and pigeon hole our success on one group of customers is missing the point.â The past seven days has seen an extraordinary rash of retail chains collapse into administration with HMV, Blockbuster and Jessops all failing, placing more than 10,000 jobs at risk. But Argos, Britainâs biggest household goods retailer, was a surprise success. It launched an enhanced website which allowed its customers to pay for their goods online and pick them up in-store. Internet sales now account for 42 per cent of the total. Yesterday the chain credited that â as well as the popularity of new tablet and smartphone applications â for its strong Christmas performance. Worrying: The past seven days has seen an extraordinary rash of retail chains collapse into administration with HMV, Blockbuster and Jessops all failing, placing more than 10,000 jobs at risk . After a recent spate of profit warnings, Terry Duddy, boss of parent company Home Retail Group, said annual profit would be Â£10million ahead of the Â£73million expected. Rival Dixons, the owner of PC World and Currys, also benefited from the drive to technology.It said it shifted five tablet computers a second in the week before Christmas. The firm, which benefited from the demise of rivals BestBuy and Comet, saw an 8 per cent increase in sales excluding recently-opened stores for the 12 weeks to January 5. But it was a different story at struggling Mothercare which said its sales fell over Christmas. The group has closed 11 loss-making stores â but said that sales in remaining shops were still down 5.9 per cent in the 13 weeks to January 12.","Primark was the star performer over the festive period .

California is at risk of losing its youthful image as the state is struggling with a declining rate of child birth. Paired with a large number of âbabyboomersâ expected to retire, and reduced migration, the stateâs prosperity is at risk . In 1970, children made up 33 per cent of Californiaâs population, a number which is expected to shrink to just over a fifth by 2030, a report by the University of Southern California shows. Not enough: Childbirth in California is now below the 'replacement rate' and it is threatening future social and economic prosperity, the study said . This means that the worldâs eight . largest economy - and the most populous state in the U.S. - is going to . have to get busy. The study showed that a child born today will have . twice the social responsibility of a person born in 1985. With childbirth shrinking . significantly in all major ethnic and racial groups since 2000, the . state has now slipped below the âreplacement rateâ of 2.1 babies per . woman of childbearing age. And with the âbabyboomâ generation set to retire, there are not enough children born to fulfill the space they leave as taxpayers.

A desk bound office worker has stunned his work colleagues by losing over eight stone in five months - by going caveman. IT consultant Jeremy White, 29, of Barry, South Wales ditched his daily snacks at his desk and started eating food from the stone age. Twenty-stone Jeremy knew he had to do something quick after being refused life insurance - and being classified as morbidly obese. Jeremy White, pictured before (right) and after (left), lost over eight stone following the Caveman diet . So after more than 10 years sitting behind a computer screen all day Jeremy, joined a gym. But instead of modern treadmills and cross trainers Jeremy started a programme of climbing ropes and throwing hammers just like his prehistoric forefathers. Jeremy said: 'I've been eating like a caveman - lots of meat and fish, nuts and berries and no processed food at all. 'And when I'm at the gym it is lots of physical lifting and pulling.' Gym addict Jeremy is now super fit and healthy . Jeremy, who is just 5ft 7in, blames his lifestyle sitting behind a desk fixing people's computer problems for his huge waistline. He lived on takeaway meals and avoided any exercise other than hitting the keys on his computer. If he went on holiday he would stay dressed in shorts and T-shirts - just like the Johnny Vegas character in TV's Benidorm. Jeremy said: 'I was too embarrassed to go anywhere near the pool or the beach. His fitness trainer said Jeremy's had the 'best results I have ever seen' as he 'did everything 100 per cent'. Jeremy's girlfriend Rebecca Matthews, 28, is looking at holiday brochures for the pair this summer . 'My family and friends would be trying to get me to go out with them but I didn't want to go anywhere.' Jeremy had promised himself for years that he would lose weight. And with his 30th birthday looming he knew he had to do something. But the crunch came last August when Jeremy was turned down for life insurance. He said: 'I realised I had to do something quick and luckily for me my new caveman lifestyle worked.'I lost a few stone very quickly and the life insurance company changed their minds.' But the most staggering change is when Jeremy is at his desk in work where just six months ago he could hardly fit. The new slimmer Jeremy - now weighing 12 stone - has delighted his girlfriend Rebecca Matthews, 28, who is looking at holiday brochures for the pair this summer. And he now wants to inspire other people to go caveman to lose weight and live a healthier lifestyle.

Killer robots that can attack targets without any human input 'should not have the power of life and death over human beings,' a new draft U.N. report says. The report for the U.N. Human Rights Commission this week has called for a worldwide moratorium on the use of killer robots until an international conference can develop rules for their use. According to the report, the United . States, Britain, Israel, South Korea and Japan have developed various . types of fully or semi-autonomous weapons. Report says killer robots, such as the Taranis aircraft, pictured, should 'not have power to destroy human life' The U.N. Human Rights Commission deals with legal and philosophical issues involved in giving robots lethal powers over humans, echoing countless science-fiction novels and films. Report author Christof Heyns, a South African professor of human rights law, focuses on a new generation of weapons that choose their targets and execute them. He calls them 'lethal autonomous robotics,' or LARs for short, and says: 'Decisions over life and death in armed conflict may require compassion and intuition. 'Humans - while they are fallible - at least might possess these qualities, whereas robots definitely do not.' He notes the arguments of robot proponents that death-dealing autonomous weapons 'will not be susceptible to some of the human shortcomings that may undermine the protection of life. 'Typically they would not act out of revenge, panic, anger, spite, prejudice or fear. Moreover, unless specifically programmed to do so, robots would not cause intentional suffering on civilian populations, for example through torture. Robots also do not rape.' His findings are due to be debated at the Human Rights Council in Geneva on May 29. The report goes beyond the recent debate over drone killings of al-Qaida suspects and nearby civilians who are maimed or killed in the air strikes. The report said killer robots differed from drones, pictured, because there is human control over drone use . Drones do have human oversight. The killer robots are programmed to make autonomous decisions on the spot without orders from humans. Heyns' report notes the increasing use of drones, which 'enable those who control lethal force not to be physically present when it is deployed, but rather to activate it while sitting behind computers in faraway places, and stay out of the line of fire. 'Lethal autonomous robotics, if added to the arsenals of States, would add a new dimension to this distancing, in that targeting decisions could be taken by the robots themselves. In addition to being physically removed from the kinetic action, humans would also become more detached from decisions to kill - and their execution,' he wrote. The report says the U.S's Phlanx system for Aegis-class cruisers could fall into the category as it automatically detects, tracks and engages anti-air warfare threats such as anti-ship missiles and aircraft. Other examples include Israel's Harpy, a 'Fire-and-Forget' autonomous weapon system designed to detect, attack and destroy radar emitters. Britain's Taranis jet-propelled combat drone prototype also can autonomously search, identify and locate enemies but can only engage with a target when authorized by mission command. It also can defend itself against enemy aircraft. The Samsung Techwin surveillance and security guard robots, deployed in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, detects targets through infrared sensors. They are currently operated by humans but have an 'automatic mode.' A separate report is due for the U.N. General Assembly this year on drone warfare and targeted killings . Current weapons systems are supposed to have some degree of human oversight. But Heyns notes that 'the power to override may in reality be limited because the decision-making processes of robots are often measured in nanoseconds and the informational basis of those decisions may not be practically accessible to the supervisor. 'In such circumstances humans are de facto out of the loop and the machines thus effectively constitute LARs,' or killer robots. Separately, another U.N. expert, British lawyer Ben Emmerson, is preparing a special investigation for the U.N. General Assembly this year on drone warfare and targeted killings. His probe was requested by Pakistan, which officially opposes the use of U.S. drones on its territory as an infringement on its sovereignty but is believed to have tacitly approved some strikes in the past. Pakistani officials say the drone strikes kill many innocent civilians, which the U.S. has rejected. The other two countries requesting the investigation were two permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Russia and China. In April, an alliance of activist and humanitarian groups led by Human Rights Watch launched the 'Campaign to Stop Killer Robots' to push for a ban on fully autonomous weapons. The group applauded Heyns' draft report in a statement on its web site.","The report written for U.N. Human Rights Commission .

The number of British men buying slimming, impotence and hair loss products has soared, new figures have revealed. A British online pharmacy says these products now account for 25 per cent of its entire sales of more than Â£15m a year. And, in a new trend, it says men increasingly buying treatments for all three ailments in one order. An analysis of 2012 sales figures by Chemist Direct found there was a 40 per cent rise in such orders from customers across the UK, compared to the previous year. The most popular products include . Regaine hair loss foam for Men, XLS-Medical and BioBurn slimming . tablets, and Maxbido, the male sexual enhancer. The biggest demand was in London and the South East, followed by the Midlands, and then the North East. In fourth place were customers in Scotland, followed by those living in the North West. Part of the rise in demand may be attributed to the recession, as increased pressure both at work and at home can cause stress, affecting a manâs sex drive, and causing weight fluctuation and even hair loss. Last year a survey found that the South East was âImpotence Capital of Englandâ Experts have warned that there could be a . rise in impotence due to men suffering from an increase in stress and . anxiety â caused by long working hours, home pressures and the . recession. Last year, in a survey of more than . 1,000 people by Good Housekeeping Magazine, more than a quarter of . couples questioned said they were having less sex than they were a year . ago, with men blaming their lack of libido on money worries. Impotence is a common condition with studies showing that up to 33 per cent of men will suffer it at some point of their life. However, the trend may also have been . triggered by men increasingly recognising that they can get help and . treatment completely anonymously online, instead of having the . embarrassment of walking into their local chemist and explaining their . symptoms - or even worse, the possibility of seeing someone they know. Experts say stress can trigger hair loss, erectile dysfunction and comfort eating . Recent research conducted by the . University of Texas and published in Journal of Clinical Investigation, . identified a link between stress and comfort eating, leading to weight . gain. And although much of male pattern baldness is thought to be hereditary, stress can also have an impact. When . a person feels intense stress, the body releases a large amount of . adrenaline; this transmits a signal to the hair follicles which causes . them to enter the telogen (resting) phase early, where they stay for . three months. During . this phase there is no new hair growth. This results in an uneven hair . growth pattern which leads to thinning hair and then hair loss. As . hair is considered to have a non-essential body function, the body will . react to stress in a way that it considers being least harmful, hence . the hair growth cycle can be affected. Chemist . Direct Chief Pharmacist Krishna Soma said: 'Over the last year weâve . seen a significant rise in orders from customers requesting treatments . for all three conditions. 'This . is supported by anecdotal evidence, with more male customers contacting . our pharmacists directly to ask about suitable treatments.' She added: 'These are extremely serious issues which can have a detrimental effect on a manâs self-confidence. 'We . understand that many men feel uncomfortable talking about these . problems in person, but want to seek expert help and get the right . treatment.'","Online chemist says men are increasingly buying treatments for all three ailments in one order, with sales up 40 per cent on the previous year .

"By . Jan Moir . PUBLISHED: . 19:01 EST, 20 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:18 EST, 22 March 2013 . The Killing, starring Sofie Grabol as Sarah Lund, has inspired a raft of new British crime drama . Oh Sarah Lund, grim-faced wearer of woolly jumpers and top cop of unremitting gloom and doom, what in the name of Forbrydelsen have you started? Remember Detective Inspector Lund? She was the morose star of The Killing, the Danish police drama called Forbrydelsen back home that became a big hit in the UK and elsewhere. Over three gory series we thrilled to dense plot-twists and turns. Got slapped around the chops by shoals of giant red herrings. Found ourselves oddly entranced as the endless rain fell on a murky Copenhagen. In this watery flume of despair, The Killing was distinguished not just by depressed Lund in her hairy jumpers but also by its bleak landscapes, noir-ish tone and eerie, jangling background music. Now there has been a slew of copycat Killings - not on the streets of the Danish capital this time, but across British television channels. Over recent weeks our small screens have been invaded by a squad of equally grim-faced detectives determined to out-gloom Sarah Lund. New whodunnit shows such as Broadchurch (ITV), Shetland (BBC) and Mayday (also BBC) have all featured crime-solving cops competing to see who can be the most lonely and enigmatic obsessive on the case - and on the planet. You know what they say. One moody and troubled cop is a coincidence. Two is a trend. Three is the future of police procedural-based drama in this country for the next ten million years. Inspired by The Killing and other Scandinavian tales of murder most foul, such as Wallander and The Bridge, the shows have several characteristics in common. There is the same kind of spooky music. The same kind of lakes being dragged. The same dread feeling that underneath the surface of a tight-knit and ostensibly happy community, something horrible lurks. In some instances, the cops even have the same kind of woolly jumpers. One important thing - and it has to be said before we can move on. Although inspired by The Killing, none of the British series actually features a female detective in charge of the whole stabbing and shooting match. Perish the thought! That might be taking things too far, guv. Next thing you know, they'll be wanting to wear trousers and make arrests instead of brewing us a nice cuppa and typing up the witness statements. And that's just not on. In Broadchurch, DS Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman) has just been passed over for the top job by DI Alec Hardy (David Tennant). In Shetland, DC Alison 'Tosh' MacIntosh (Alison O'Donnell) plays second fiddle to DI Jimmy Perez (Douglas Henshall). She wears a duffel coat and is so dizzy she can't remember how to read suspects their rights properly. Mayday has no central detective character in the traditional sense, but does have Fiona (Sophie Okonedo), a policewoman who has just left the force to concentrate on being a mother and raising her family. Even though she knows she is a better cop than her cop husband. That's got to hurt. Like Sarah Lund, these women must keep their real feelings hidden as the murderer continues to elude their grasp and they negotiate the blizzard of bleak. Olivia Coleman and David Tennant star in ITV's new crime drama Broadchurch, but Jan Moir is peeved about Tennant being Coleman's boss . So in the meantime, let us sift . through the evidence, beat up the suspects in time-honoured tradition . and ask the big question. Out of all the new Killing-lites and . Killing-alikes, whodunnit best? Most . will say it is a clear win for Broadchurch, the suspenseful eight-part . ITV drama with David Tennant. As Hardy, he has been deployed to a Dorset . seaside town to solve the murder of 11-year-old Danny, whose body was . found on the beach under the dramatic honey cliffs of the Jurassic . Coast. It was meant to look like an accident, but moody Hardy smells a . rat. Is he a Lund-a-like? Well, he never . smiles. He is a study in low-grade grump and is rude to everyone. Friends or lovers? None that we know of. Inner torment? Plenty. All we . know is that Something Bad Happened on a previous case. Hardy has panic attacks every time he . thinks about it. His eyes are huge and black, oscillating above his . velvety beard. There are moments when he looks like a troubled vole. A . vole who says things like 'everything matters now' with his mouth in a . thin, white line. He is awful to Miller, who keeps crying and giving him fish suppers and cups of tea. This week she lost it and threatened to 'p*** in a cup and throw it at you' when he was a bit disrespectful. Then she invited him for dinner with her family. I wish she'd make up her mind. Suspects? Everyone from Pauline Quirke looking shifty in a caravan to the owner of the newsagent's where Danny had a paper round. Nearly eight million people tuned in for this week's episode, which was tightly plotted and gripping despite the amusing smorgasbord of vastly different West Country accents. However, one important point. Surely DC Miller's pivotal relationship with the murder victim - her son was his best friend - would have meant that she was taken off the case? The same thought occurred when the constable in Shetland - I mean both the two-part series and the eponymous island it is set on - discovered the body of his granny outside her cottage. Instead of being sidelined into investigating a mitten found on a railing in downtown Lerwick, he just carried on working on the case. Is that even allowed? Meanwhile, Shetland the drama was so Lund-inspired it has even been nicknamed The McKilling. Dougie Henshall strode around the treeless landscape, looking uncannily like Jeremy Vine and shouting at suspects in a macho way. Old men would cower at the sound of his boots and say things like: 'Ah've no left ma croft all night!' However, I loved the dignified and thoughtful way he spoke to a bereaved mother in a scene at Lerwick airport. All too often the police are portrayed as one-dimensional brutes who care only about making a collar. Nice to see the other side for a change. Jimmy has a nice selection of phlegm-coloured woollies that Sarah Lund would approve of. And when it comes to interior emotion, he has a great way of letting anguish wash across his face that is as Danish as a flitch of bacon. Inner torment? I'll say. A dead wife and troubled teenage step-daughter? That will do nicely. On Shetland, Douglas Henshall, centre, plays DI Jimmy Perez, and his second-in-command is 'Tosh', played by Alison O'Donnel, right, who Moir complains 'is so dizzy she can't remember how to read suspects their rights properly' His sidekick Tosh also wore shapeless jumpers - the colour of dried mustard, yuk - and said things like 'Professor Berglund has been telling porky pies'. While Shetland was perhaps the closest to the Scandi-ideal, Mayday certainly caught the downbeat, suffocating mood. Shown by the BBC over five days last week, it centred on the murder of Hattie, a 14-year-old village Mayday queen. Creepy and confusing, it starred Sophie Okonedo as retired cop Fiona, smart enough to suspect the murderer from the beginning. But it was a struggle for the rest of us to know what was going on. A bird's nest clue? A psychopathic Irishman? A man whose wife had turned his shed into a pottery workshop? There was witchcraft, erectile dysfunction and slo-mo shots - though these elements were not put together, thank goodness. The ending might have been rather unsatisfactory - without giving anything away, how did she know? - but Mayday had terrific ensemble acting, morally complex characters and depth. In the worlds of Broadchurch, Shetland and Mayday, nothing is ever what it seems. And just as in their Nordic noir counterparts, emotions are always deep-frozen, eyes never meet and the jumpers are always scratchy. Yet while each of these dramas held fast to the gloomy prototype, they were never quite as brilliant, as depressing or as startling as the originals. We need a Sarah Lund of our own for a start. How long must we wait before we get one?","Broadchurch, Mayday and Shetland are all new UK crime dramas...

Easter Sunday is a day of celebration and feasting. A day of fluffy chicks and rebirth. A day that Sophie Wessex chose to hatch her new look upon an unsuspecting world. And crikey, what a vision of sizzling peacockery to flutter before our tired eyes! Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Is it a royal cry for help? Do not adjust your sets. Pop on a pair of these anti-dazzle, mortification-proof fashion visors before you peek. For . yes, that really is the Countess of Wessex attending the traditional . Easter service at Windsor Castle with other members of the Royal Family. That really is our . Soph strutting into St Georgeâs Chapel looking like the chief purser on a . SexyAirways late-night flight to Rio. On . this most holy of days, for reasons that have yet to become clear, . Sophie chose an electric blue suit, sculpted over her body and clinging . tighter than the shrink-wrap on a pair of slightly flattened avocados. The skirt had an I-dare-you zip all the way up the back, matching the fruity bondage zips that tracked up each arm. Sophie . teamed this with a racy pair of cocktail stick heels and topped off her . ay-caramba! new image with the kind of towering, peacock feather hat . that would have had Carmen Miranda begging for mercy. Yes, she looked fabulous, totally amazing â but was it really an appropriate outfit for church? To . be honest, her suit is the kind of thing youâd expect to see on a . flirty lieutenant serving cocktails on the bridge of the Starship . Enterprise â not on a member of the Royal Family wiggling into a holy . service. So what does this lemming-like lurch . in style direction mean for a countess previously noted for taking . decades-long refuge in forgiving pastels and ill-fitting frocks, not to . mention her penchant for fifty shades of beige? First, ask yourself this. If the Countess of Wessexâs Easter outfit could speak, what would it be saying? It . would be screaming: âLook at me!â It would be shouting: âMove over, . Kate.â It would be hollering: âStuff you, Pippa!â It might even whisper: . âNever mind my bum, does my royal standing look big in this?â Certainly, the arrival of perfectly . groomed Kate Middleton and her attention-grabbing sister Pippa on the . scene caused a fluttering in the royal dovecotes. Unless . they wanted to disappear even further into the margins of irrelevance, . the royal ladies have had to up their fashion game and project . themselves better at public events. Look at Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who now try very, very hard to win favour with their silly hats and shortie skirts. They fail to understand that they cannot wheedle their way into public affection by looking fashionable: they have to do stuff. Fashion: Sophie in peach at Zara Phillipsâ wedding (left) and navy (right) for the Queenâs Diamond Jubliee . In the meantime, is it merely competition from the Duchess of Cambridge that is behind the Countess of Wessexâs transformation from frumpy Sloane to royal fashionista? Perhaps, but the truth is that Sophie has undergone an incredible style renaissance over the past few years. Last month, this was recognised when the 48-year-old countess was announced as the first ever patron of the London College of Fashion, a position she will hold for the next three years. The edgy Easter outfit shows she is taking her new credentials seriously â perhaps too seriously. Yet anything is an improvement on the horrors that went before. In the past, style and Sophie were two ships that never passed in the night. If they did, they crashed into each other with a loss of all hands on deck and some terrible damage to the beam end. Fashion turkey: Christmas 2003 . Court jester: May 2002 . Non-starter: Royal Ascot, 2001 . Yes, we were all guilty of terrible fashion crimes in the Eighties and Nineties, but Sophie must shoulder-pad a disproportionate amount of blame. Those boxy Diana-alike blazers, those sherbet pink shantung silk skirts, those shiny tights that look like pearlised sausage casings, jumpers with anchors on them. Sophie wore the lot. When she started dating Prince Edward in 1993 â they married in 1999, so their engagement lasted an eternity for royal circles â fresh horrors emerged. At Royal Ascot, you could always depend on Sophie to wear the wrong colour in the wrong shape, with a hideola hat to top it off. On formal occasions, she was the classic English rose; a bursting bud crammed into a strapless, too-tight dress; a detonated tube of toothpaste with a matching clutch. Then something happened. Something incredible. It is not just that Sophie Wessex is one of those women who just looks better and better the older she gets, it is also that she has found â finally â an age-appropriate, effortlessly elegant style that suits her. Sexier shoes, nicer colours, clothes that fit better. Caped crusader: February 2009 . Sweater-girl: 1994 . A boyish-botch in 1994 . Sophie has found salvation in all of these things. It may have taken a long time, but she got there in the end. A personal trainer and regular pilates sessions have also helped this newly stylish royal to bloom. At Zara Phillipsâ wedding, Sophie stole the show in peach chiffon. At the Queenâs Diamond Jubilee service at St Paulâs last year, she was flawless in navy blue. At Sandringham, over Christmas, she wore an oatmeal duster coat and statement hat with easy style. By the time she scrambles up the royal ranks and makes it to duchess, she is going to be just perfect. And that was her plan all along. In Royal circles, Sophie is known as Teacherâs Pet. This is because the Queen absolutely adores her perfectly behaved, sugar-sprinkled daughter-in-law. While Princess Anne has always been Phillipâs favourite child â a female echo of his blunderbuss ways â sweet Sophie is the companionable and biddable daughter the Queen never had. Unless you count that unfortunate business with the fake sheikh back in 2001 (Sophie was caught on tape disparaging Cherie Blair and making political comments), she hasnât put a foot wrong. Until now, perhaps. One of the reasons we all love the Queen is that HM is dutiful but understated. Always. And until she climbed into her Lycra cyber suit at the weekend, Sophie Wessex was the same. So, just when she has been getting it so right, letâs hope she doesnât start going horribly wrong, egged on by all her new fashion pals. Being photographed so much puts huge pressure on the younger royals â but it never pays to try too hard. Youâve proved you have a real sense of style, Sophie. Now, just go out and enjoy it!","Easter Sunday was day when Sophie Wessex chose to hatch a new look .

Backlash: Chris Bucchere, left, allegedly plowed into pedestrian Sutchi Hui, right, on March 29 and then took to an online forum to tell his side of the story. Bucchere now faces felony gross vehicular manslaughter charges . Alex Bastian, prosecuting Assistant District Attorney, said 'Court testimony indicated that . [Bucchere] was going at least 30 mph and that he ran two red lights and a . stop sign prior to going through the intersection where the collision . occurred.' As reported by the LA Times, District Attorney George Gascon stated: 'Today the judge reaffirmed our decision to charge this case as a felony. 'I hope this case serves as a reminder to all that there are life-altering consequences to not following the rules of the road,' Gascon added. A felony charge is rare for a bicycle collision. The Wall Street Journal noted that the district attorney's office wasn't able to find another case of vehicular manslaughter involving a bicycle in recent years in the U.S. Bucchere's attorney, Ted Cassman, had argued during an earlier hearing that the charge should be reduced to misdemeanor. Tragic: Chris Bucchere allegedly struck 71-year-old Sutchi Hui, who later died, at a busy San Francisco intersection, and then identified himself as the rider in the crash on an internet forum . Witnesses told . police that Bucchere might have run a red light before striking the . elderly man, who tragically died in hospital four days after the . collision. The cyclist, . who was also hospitalized for injuries he sustained in the crash, . apparently posted on the 'Mission Cycling AM Riders' Google group to . tell his side of the story on the same day.

'I . couldn't see a line through the crowd and I couldn't stop, so I laid it . down and just plowed through the crowded crosswalk in the . least-populated place I could find,' he said. 'I . don't remember the next five minutes but when I came to, I was in a neck . brace being loaded into an ambulance. I remember seeing a RIVER of . blood on the asphalt, but it wasn't mine. 'Apparently I hit a 71-year-old . male pedestrian and he ended up in the ICU with pretty serious head . injuries. I really hope he ends up OK.' Widowed: Hui's wife Betty, who was a witness to the accident, says she is at a loss without her husband, adding that he was her best friend . But what created the most outrage among internet users was the way the Bucherre ended his post, after detailing the seriousness of the injuries sustained by the man he had hit. 'In closing, I want to dedicate this story to my late helmet. She died in heroic fashion today as my head slammed into the tarmac... may she die knowing that because she committed the ultimate sacrifice, her rider and live and ride on. Can I get an amen? Amen.'

Location: The intersection at Castro and Market streets, in San Francisco, where the fatal accident took place . D.A. Spokesman Omid Talai told the San Francisco Chronicle they considered the posts to be the work of Bucchere. 'We've seen it,' said Talai. 'It's troubling.'

'Chris is devastated by the accident last Thursday and by the tragic death of Sutchi Hui,' Cassman said. 'Chris believes that he entered the intersection lawfully and that he did everything possible to avoid the accident. His heart goes out to Mr Hui's wife and family for their loss.' But Hui's wife, Betty, who was with him at the time of the crash, told how she saw her injured husband covered in blood and how she is at a loss without him.

Royal dentist Sir Nicholas Sturridge, whose son Dominic has been stymied by Home Office officials who have refused to give his wife UK residency . As the son of the Queenâs Harley Street dentist, Dominic Sturridge had every reason to believe that returning to Britain with his new bride after six years abroad would be a formality. But Dominic, whose father Sir Nicholas Sturridge received his knighthood after 32 years as surgeon dentist to the Royal Household, faces heartache after Home Office officials refused to grant his young Thai wife residency. âWe are a perfectly legitimate couple and really didnât expect all this trouble,â says Dominic, 44. âMy troubles started when I returned from Thailand where Iâve been working with major property dealers for six years. I met Eed there and fell in love.â Speaking at a Chelsea cocktail party, Dominic â a cousin of actor Tom Sturridge, the beau of film star Sienna Miller â tells me: âEed and I got married in Bangkok but neither of our parents came. âI suppose my father had more conventional lifestyle hopes for me, as we come from five generations of medics and he looked after the Queen Motherâs teeth as well. âEven though Dad didnât really understand my relationship with Eed, he turned up at Heathrow to greet us with a bottle of champagne when we came to England. âThis is no bought Thai bride situation. I love her deeply.â While Dominic is continuing to work in property in London, Eed, 24, has found work, too. âShe is not living off me and has got a job at a Covent Garden cocktail bar and Iâm proud of her,â he says. According to Sturridge, the Home Office has rejected her request to settle here. âIt has got very strict and said we didnât have joint bank accounts or a joint electricity bill. âIâm sure my father was shocked when this all happened, but he has been brilliant and when itâs sorted out Iâm thinking of having a traditional English wedding or blessing, too, so he can be there and share our happiness. âI just hope this doesnât drag on for too long.â The Home Office says it has strict entry requirements for foreign spouses of British subjects. âThese range from financial stipulations to showing the couple have actually met and proving the relationship is genuine and subsisting,â says a spokesman. Romantic novelist Santa Montefiore, pictured right, has had her dramas over the years â not least when she called the fire brigade and declared: âMy name is Santa and my chimney is on fire.â But friends of the best-selling author were a little alarmed to receive an email begging for money because she and her family had been âmugged in an alley by a gang of thugsâ in Naples.

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 11:59 EST, 3 November 2011 . A paedophile imam who abused young girls while teaching at a mosque has been jailed for two years. Ebrahim Yusuf Kazi, 67, was told by a judge he would have been jailed for longer - but the law prevented it as the offences took place 27 years ago. The cleric sexually assaulted three victims - all aged under 11 - during class as he taught groups of youngsters alone inside the mosque, Swindon Crown Court heard. He would invite the girls to read a passage from a book in front of the other children - before groping and touching their genitals under the desk. He also locked himself in a toilet cubicle with one of the girls, removed her clothes before he touched and licked her body. Ebrahim Yusuf Kazi, 67, looked quizzically at his interpreter - translating in his native Gujarati - as he was ordered down to the cells . Kazi's campaign of abuse only . surfaced 27 years later when the brave victims finally decided to speak . out and confront him in court. The women wept yesterday as they saw . Kazi jailed after being convicted on five counts of sexual assault at . the court in Wiltshire. Judge Euaun Ambrose said: 'You were in a position of very considerable status, trust and authority. 'It was a position of total power and respect - not only within the mosque but also within the local Muslim community. 'You were trusted by those who . attended the mosque. You were also trusted by the parents who sent their . children to be taught by you. 'However, you wasted the opportunities the position gave you and indecently assaulted three of these children. 'All were pre-pubescent girls and all were entrusted to your care. 'This was a gross breach of trust. Against all this you continue to deny any responsibility for these . offences and have shown no remorse. 'There has become much stiffer . sentences for this type of behaviour but I am obliged as a matter of law . to sentence you in regard to the law at the time. 'Had these offences been committed more recently the sentences that I pass would be much, much longer.' Jailed: Swindon Crown Court (pictured) heard Kazi angrily claimed one girl was a liar when she told her parents what he had done to another child . Speaking after the sentencing, PC Dawn Simmonds, from Wiltshire Police, branded Kazi a 'scheming paedophile'. She said: 'I am frustrated that the court could not impose a longer sentence. He is a scheming paedophile. 'But I am pleased the judge has recognised the offences that Kazi did. 'As abuses of trust go it was the ultimate really and will effect the victims for the rest of their lives. 'Not . only did he subject these children to these despicable acts but he has . shown no remorse for his actions, having now also put them through the . ordeal of a trial. 'I would like to thank the victims for having the courage to come forward.' Stephen Dent, prosecuting, said Kazi . preyed on the youngsters while imam at the town's Broad Street Mosque, . between June 1979 and April 1985. He taught large groups of around 20 pupils alone in a room - making girls come up and read passages from a book to him. He would then fondle their legs from underneath a desk, touching their private parts until they finished the passage. Kazi's three devastated victims - . aged around eight, nine and ten when the abuse started - claimed each . terrifying and repeated episode could carry on for as long as 15 . minutes. He groomed one of his victims and . continued to abuse her over a number of years. He would take her to a . toilet cubicle and progressed, over a period of time, from touching her . under her clothes to stripping her and licking her body parts. The court heard that the cleric was 'revered' in the girl's family so she did not speak out. When one of the other girls told her . parents what Kazi did to her - the defendant angrily branded her a . 'liar' and the allegations went away. Another family pulled their girl out of the mosque, after her brother witnessed the abuse. They were forced to give evidence against Kazi at the trial last month which convicted him of five counts of sexual assault. Judge Ambrose, quoting from impact . statements of the three victims - now all grown women - said one still . had nightmares about the abuse. They all said it continued to affect their lives. Martin Steen, defending, said Kazi had moved to Gloucester since the offences and was now a respected member of the community. He claimed that Kazi, who is . suffering with bad health and depression, has had to install panic . alarms in his home since the offences came to light. Mr Steen handed the judge 24 letters . from community members, praising Kazi. One woman said she would never . think twice about leaving her child with him. He said: 'Perceptions have changed . and in the mean time this man has changed. He has behaved impeccably in . terms of support given to the community.' As well as jailing Kazi for two years, Judge Ambrose also imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention Order against him. The defendant, dressed in white . religious robes and a Muslim skull cap, looked quizzically at his . interpreter - translating in his native Gujarati - as he was ordered . down to the cells.","Judge said Kazi, 67, would have been jailed for longer but law prevented it as offences took place so long ago .

David Rodgers: The long-term heroin user, 62, stuffed the needle into a loaf on sale in a Tesco store . A heroin-using grandfather who stuffed a used syringe into a supermarket loaf of bread that was later bought by an unsuspecting mother has been jailed for a year. The woman discovered the needle - which had been stuck through the middle of the loaf by 62-year-old David Rodgers - after she used the bread to make her 10-year-old son a chicken sandwich for his school lunchbox, Manchester Crown Court heard. Rodgers, from Weaste, who was traced by a speck of his blood left inside the syringe, had contaminated the loaf in a branch of Tesco Extra in Salford last December. He claimed to be 'deeply remorseful' when he appeared in the dock to answer charges of contaminating or interfering with goods with intent to cause public alarm or anxiety in a rare case. The needle he concealed in the loaf was found to contain no infectious diseases. Jailing him, Mr Recorder Stuart Driver QC rejected as 'totally implausible' Rodgers' claim that he put the needle in the bread in a bid to hide his drug 'lapse' from his wife of 39 years. Rodgers 'intended that syringe should be found by somebody and that person should suffer trauma', the judge said. The court heard that Rodgers had 114 offences to his name on a criminal record stretching back to 1959, and that he had used heroin on and off for more than 20 years. The court heard that the mum bought the bread while shopping at Tesco Extra on December 1. She had already used a couple of slices to make her son's sandwich when she felt 'something hard' in the loaf, which she was 'alarmed and distressed' to discover was an orange hypodermic needle. She added: 'Even though I was told the chance of any virus or illness surviving in the syringe was minimal, I was still very worried. I also had a three-month-old baby at the time and this caused unnecessary stress.' Rodgers was revealed as the culprit after the bakery collected the bread and it was sent off by police for testing. Following his arrest, Rodgers claimed he had a 'relapse' into heroin use in early December, and had gone into Tesco with the needle in his pocket. 'Bizarre and shocking': A judge said Rodgers' claim he put the needle in the loaf at the store in Salford, Greater Manchester, to hide his drug 'relapse' from his wife was 'totally implausible' Marsha Myers, defending, said it was a 'bizarre' and 'shocking' case, but argued for the defendant to be given a suspended sentence, describing him as 'troubled' by ill-health and depression. But, the sentencing judge said offences like these called for 'deterrent sentences'. Locking him up, Mr Recorder Driver QC told him: 'You intended the food to be purchased, you intended that syringe should be found by somebody and that person should suffer trauma, to be shocked and worried by what they found, and you succeeded in exactly that.'","Heroin-user David Rodgers, 62, stuffed used needle into loaf at Tesco store .

"By . Jessica Satherley . UPDATED: . 06:47 EST, 11 December 2011 . Preparing for release: Karen Matthews pictured in handcuffs after leaving Dewsbury police station in 2008 . Karen Matthews, who arranged the kidnapping of her own daughter Shannon to claim Â£50,000, is getting ready for an early prison release and to move abroad with her mystery admirer. The 36-year-old has apparently been receiving letters from a wealthy admirer while serving her eight year sentence at Foston Hall prison in Derbyshire. And the mother-of-seven, who is set to be released in April after serving just three years, is preparing to meet her pen-pal from northern England once freed. Matthewsâ admirer apparently started writing to her after seeing her photograph in a newspaper and penned that heâd âlike to stroll along a beach with herâ, the Sunday Mirror reported. And a friend of the mother told the newspaper that sheâs preparing to move to Cyprus once released. The mother has lost three stone while locked up and has changed her hair colour to avoid being recognised once freed. Earlier this year her hair was cut by fellow inmate and road rage killer Tracie Andrews. She is said to be terrified that sheâll be attacked when out of prison and wants to move abroad to start a new life. But Matthews wonât be allowed to permanently live overseas once freed on licence â only shorter unsupervised trips will be permitted. While serving her sentence, Matthews has been on a block with convicted child killers and paedophiles, who have repeatedly attacked her in prison, according to previous reports. Early release: Karen Matthews has been serving her sentence at Foston Hall prison in Derbyshire (pictured) An inmate told the Daily Mirror in June: . âSheâs had a bashing quite a few times.

"By . David Martosko . PUBLISHED: . 21:50 EST, 2 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:16 EST, 3 May 2013 . The State Department Office of Inspector General is investigating an internal review board which largely cleared then-secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other high-ranking officials of wrongdoing in connection with the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. The assault on the diplomatic compound left U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others dead. But the White House has relied on the pronouncements of the Accountability Review Board, whose credibility is now being challenged for allegedly failing to interview key witnesses who specifically requested to be heard. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United . Nations Thomas Pickering and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of . Staff Admiral Mike Mullen co-chaired the blue-ribbon panel. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Terrorists attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012, leaving a burned-out shell and four dead bodies. One was U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, who had requested more security forces but got no help from the State Department . State Department Deputy Inspector General Harold Geisel (L) hasn't publicly confirmed that his office is probing the Accountability Review Board, but Fox News reports that an investigation is underway. Former UN Ambassador Thomas Pickering (R) co-chaired the panel with former Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen . It blamed the Benghazi catastrophe on 'systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels' inside the State Department, but said nothing about responsibility that might be shared by Clinton and President Obama. The report also concluded that despite Ambassador Stevens' repeated requests for more security forces at diplomatic installations in Libya, no military resources were close enough to Benghazi to intervene during the Sept. 11, 2012 attack. But accounts published in October indicate that at least one Navy SEAL team that was about a mile away from the consulate was told by superiors to 'stand down' during the raid instead of rushing to the aid of its employees. Fox News has also reported that Delta Force special operators were told to wait before approaching Benghazi. The CIA has denied those reports, insisting that no such requests were turned down. Followers of the Ansar al-Shariah Brigades burned the U.S. flag in Benghazi, Libya, three days after the raid on the U.S> consulate there. 'Obama, Obama,' they chanted, 'we are all Osama' Blood stains at the main gate of the consulate were believed to be from one of the American staff members after militant terrorists attacked the outpost with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades . Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama spoke at Andrews Air Force Base three days after the assault when the remains of four victims were returned to the United States. At the time, the administration was holding to the line that protesters upset by a blasphemous American movie overwhelmed the Benghazi compound - an account later proved false . Clinton and other officials declined to answer questions about Benghazi from Congress until the report was completed. Afterward, the White House and others leaned heavily on the report to claim Clinton was not to blame. Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio, however, has said that Clinton will have to fully answer for her role in the debacle if she seeks the Democratic nomination in the 2016 presidential election. 'I think that ultimately, if Secretary Clinton runs for office in the future,' Rubio says in an upcoming documentary film titled Benghazi 9-11, 'she is going to have to explain why, during her helm at the State Department, one of two things happened: Either, number 1, they were aware of a security situation in Libya and failed to act accordingly, or, number 2, they had such a bad operation that they were not aware of it.' Sen. Marco Rubio, who reportedly has presidential aspirations of his own, warned that Clinton would need to fully explain her conduct surrounding Benghazi if she were to seek the White House in 2016 . If the Accountability Review Board's findings lose credibility, it will likely damage the reputation of co-chair and Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen . In her January 23 testimony before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Clinton famously threw up her hands during a heated argument with Wisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson and suggested that there was little point in determining the nature of the attack and what led to it, several months after it happened. 'The fact is we had four dead Americans,' Clinton said. 'Was it because of a protest? Or was it because of guys out for a walk one night and decided they would go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make?' The Obama administration claimed in the days following the terror attack that it was sparked by protesters who were angry about a YouTube video that mocked Muhammad, modern Islam's founding prophet. 'We were misled that there were supposedly protests and then something spread out of that - an assault sprang out of that,' Sen. Johnson insisted. 'And that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact ... And the American people could have known that within days, and they didn't know that.' U.S. Senator Ron Johnson tangled with Clinton in January over whether the administration misled the public with claims that a YouTuibe video offensive to Muslims sparked violence in Benghazi . Congressional investigators in the House of Representatives established in late 2012 that the Obama administration edited a set of unclassified talking points about the attack Benghazi attack to omit references to al-Qaeda and other radical Islamist terror groups. CNN reported on Wednesday that sources said as many as three al-Qaeda operatives from inside Yemen took part in the Benghazi attack. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the group that operates in Yemen, is also behind Inspire magazine, the periodical thought to have provided bomb-building instructions for Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the accused Boston Marathon terrorists. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is the same group that said in a statement three days after the Sept. 11, 2012 military-style assault on the Benghazi consulate that it was an act of revenge for the 2012 death of al-Qaeda leader Abu Yahya al-Libi. But the group fell short of claiming responsibility for the attack . Four days earlier On September 10, the senior al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a video specifically calling for his group's foot soldiers to avenge al-Libi's death by attacking Americans in Libya. The Accountability Review Board 'did not find that any individual U.S. Government employee engaged in misconduct or willfully ignored his or her responsibilities' 'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,' reads the preamble to the board's report on the Benghazi terror attack . The State Department has lacked a permanent inspector general since the beginning of the Obama administration. Although Deputy Inspector General Harold W. Geisel has not publicly confirmed that his office is investigating the the Accountability Review Board's thoroughness,Â Fox NewsÂ reported on Wednesday that his office is probing the panel's performance. An unnamed State Department official told Fox News that the probe is not a 'formal investigation,' but termed it a review process that would also examine previous review boards convened to report on other past incidents. The Benghazi board interviewed more than 100 witnesses, but there's no evidence they included any U.S. personnel who survived the attack. At least four of them have now retained lawyers to help them circumvent what they say are roadblocks erected by the Obama administration to prevent them from telling Congress what they know. One of those attorneys, a former Justice Department official and Republican counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee named Victoria Toensing, told television audiences this week that her client is a civil servant whose career has been threatened by political appointees if he testifies before Congress. Yahya Ibrahim, the terrorist leader tied to the Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, edits . al-Qaeda's Inspire magazine. He is also sought to be linked to Yemenis who took part in the Benghazi attack . Al Qaeda militants have recently been the subject of a government crackdown in Yemen. These criminal defendants reacted as a verdict upholding their jail sentences was pronounced at a state security court of appeals in April . 'Make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom,' advised al-Qaeda's Inspire magazine (L). The periodical is thought to have influenced Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the accused Boston Marathon bomber who died in a shootout with police . The House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee will convene a hearing on May 8 that is expected to include the testimony of several Benghazi survivors. On Tuesday President Obama claimed he was 'not familiar with this notion that anybody's been blocked from testifying' about the raid in Libya that happened nearly eight months ago. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney seemed to take refuge the next day in the elapsed time since the terror attack. 'Benghazi happened a long time ago,' Carney told reporters during a briefing Wednesday. 'We are unaware of any agency blocking an employee who would like to appear before Congress.' Toensing has insisted that despite her active Top Secret security clearance and a demanding letter from Congress, the administration has blocked her from receiving the specific security clearance she would need before she could legally learn what her own client knows. Rep. Darrell Issa chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which will hear testimony on May 8 from witnesses thought to include survivors of the Benghazi attack . Former deputy assistant attorney general Victoria Toensing claims her client, a Benghazi survivor, has been threatened with career damage if he tells Congress what he saw on the night of Sept. 11, 2012 . An April 23 report from House Republicans claimed the Obama administration engaged in a cover-up after hte Benghazi raid, which cost the lived of four including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens (R) John Kerry, then a Democratic senator from Massachusetts and now the U.S. Secretary of State, visited in early February with at least one Benghazi survivor at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Maryland. As many as 30 survivors were treated at Walter Reed, according to multiple media reports. Virginia Republican Frank Wolf has claimed that as many as seven may still be there, shielded from the media by the federal government. South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said in March that he had been in contact with some survivors' families, who told him their loved ones have been 'told to be quiet' by Obama administration officials.","Review board concluded that no specific U.S. personnel were to blame for four American deaths .

"By . Simon Heffer . PUBLISHED: . 19:58 EST, 27 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:34 EST, 28 March 2013 . Before he fell ill: Great British actor Richard Attenborough in 2008 before his stroke . Millions will have been saddened to read on Tuesday that Richard Attenborough, now in his 90th year and one of our most loved and admired directors, is too infirm to live at home. He and his wife, the actress Sheila Sim, have been living in a nursing home for retired entertainers for the past 15 months. Lord Attenborough suffered a stroke nearly five years ago, from which he has made an incomplete recovery. In the Eighties and Nineties, Attenborough became such a ubiquitous figure in the British film industry â as a director and producer, but also as President of BAFTA â that it became hard to imagine it going on without him. His career behind the camera had started with Oh! What A Lovely War in 1969, and Young Winston, and went on to include the equally acclaimed A Bridge Too Far. To most people under 50, his fame rests in directing Gandhi (for which he won an Oscar), Cry Freedom, Chaplin and Shadowlands â and, long after it was thought he had retired as an actor, for his role as John Hammond in Jurassic Park. Such was his status as a national treasure that he was immortalised as a lachrymose Spitting Image puppet, overcome with theatrical displays of emotion and referring to fellow thespians as âdarlingâ. But that renown as a film-maker, and as the ultimate âluvvieâ, unfairly overshadowed one very important fact about him: that, in the heyday of British cinema from the Forties to the Sixties, he was one of its very finest actors, and has a claim to be the greatest of his generation. Talented couple: A young Richard Attenborough and wife actress Sheila Sim arriving for Judy Garland show at the Dominion Theatre in London . Multi-talented: Attenborough as Pinkie in 1947's Brighton Rock, which was his first leading role . Attenborough was in many of the great films of that golden age. In them, he demonstrated an astonishing range as an actor â he could play cowards, spivs, thugs, shallow working-class lads, and cheeky private soldiers, but also clean-cut young men, charming rogues and men of astonishing courage. Only John Mills, of all the greats of the British cinema, had a comparable talent. His film debut was in a small but striking part in Noel Cowardâs naval propaganda masterpiece In Which We Serve, released in 1942. Just 18, he played a young gunner who goes into a blue funk when his ship comes under attack, his cowardice risking the lives of his shipmates. Coward, playing the shipâs captain, talks to him sternly when the attack is over, but also shows him great kindness, forgiving a youthful indiscretion and not having the boy court-martialled. It is one of the most memorable moments in a very memorable film. After the war, Attenboroughâs career rapidly took off, and he moved from playing bit parts to starring roles. His first big leading part, in 1947, was as the brutal Pinkie in Brighton Rock, based on Graham Greeneâs novel about razorblade gangs in pre-war Brighton. Having specialised in meek young men until this point, Attenborough had the chance to play against type. His portrayal of Pinkie leaves nothing wanting in comparison with the vicious, psychopathic, morally dead character Greene created in his novel. It was the first film in which Attenborough had the chance to dominate the screen, and he did. He makes Brighton Rock his film. Brooding: Attenborough, here with Carol Marsh, made Brighton Rock his film with his arresting portrayal of the brutal Pinkie . Brighton Rock exhibits Attenboroughâs skills superbly. The way his bullying swagger turns to fear on the racecourse when he realises the gang around him are about to turn on him is sublime. But he also shows a great command of malevolence. Just when you think he cannot become more vile, the pleasure he takes in recording a message on a vinyl disc for his deluded girlfriend in which he tells her how much he despises her is played with utter relish. Happily for the girl, the record sticks when she plays it afterÂ  Pinkieâs death, and her illusionsÂ  are unshattered. Two other highly successful outings followed immediately afterwards. In London Belongs To Me, Attenborough plays a foolish young man who, by a misjudgment, ends up convicted of a murder he has not committed. He is sentenced to death, but reprieved at the last minute. His next role could not have been more different. Because he looked very young for his age (he was nearly 25 but could pass for a fresh-faced teenager) he was completely credible as the star of The Guinea Pig, in which he plays a shopkeeperâs son who wins a scholarship to a public school. Challenging roles: In The Angry Silence in 1960, Attenborough starred as a factory worker who would not strike . Although the film is dated now, it shows yet another side to Attenboroughâs talents. He plays the chameleon-like boy to perfection, taking him up the social ladder. In the Fifties, Attenborough was in demand as a West End stage actor â he and his wife were both in the original production of The Mousetrap by Agatha Christie â but he continued to play leading roles in serious dramas, many of which echoed earlier parts he had played. In Morning Departure â a bleakly realistic film about the dangers of the submarine service â he again exhibits cowardice, only to find inner strength when the crisis comes. Satire: Attenborough starred as Lexy in crime comedy The League of Gentlemen in 1960, seen here with Terence Alexander, left and Kieron Moore, right, prepare to escape from the army camp . But from the mid-Fifties, at about the same time that he was dabbling more and more in screenwriting, Attenborough developed a new side to his acting talent, in sophisticated, satirical comedies. In Privateâs Progress, a send-up of the Army, he played a workshy, lead-swinging troublemaker to perfection. He had a bigger role three years later in what was effectively the filmâs sequel, which showed the troubled transition some soldiers made to civilian life. Iâm All Right Jack is best remembered for Peter Sellersâs magnificent depiction of the Stalinist shop steward Fred Kite: but Attenborough has a strong supporting part as an entirely believable conman and wide boy. The peak of his satirical career was, though, in The League Of Gentlemen, where he played one of a group of former Army officers who band together to rob a bank. Long-lasting career: In The Flight Of The Phoenix from 1965 he played Lew Moran opposite James Stewart . Again, Attenborough is pitch-perfect as someone who is not-quite-a-gentleman trying to fit in with a crowd that is not naturally his own. The serious roles, however, continued through the Fifties and Sixties. He shines as a chirpy soldier in Sea Of Sand, one of the most under-rated British war films of the Fifties, set in the western desert. He excelled in Ealingâs last great epic, Dunkirk, as the weak little man who, in the countryâs hour of mortal peril, takes his own Thames pleasure boat across the Channel to help get British soldiers off the beaches of France in 1940. But he possibly played no finer role in his career than that of Tom Curtis, a factory hand sent to Coventry by his workmates for exercising his conscience, putting his family first, and refusing to go on strike. It is clear the strike has been politically motivated by communists, giving the film a sinister undertone. Triumph: 10 Rillington Place from 1971 . was haunting triumph with Attenborough playing serial killer John Christie . Attenborough captures the anguish, misery and heroism of Curtis completely in The Angry Silence: as in Brighton Rock, he commands the film. His integrity as an actor shines through in this film. Although his own politics were of the Left, the way in which he plays Curtis, persecuted by organised labour, gives no quarter. Twice in a year â the first time being Iâm All Right Jack â Attenborough taps into the public unease at the way in which unelected trades unionists call the shots. In their different ways, both films contributed powerfully to the sense that the unions were overmighty subjects, and heading for a fall. Celebrated: Attenborough won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director for Gandhi in 1982 . There were other triumphs later in his career â notably as escape organiser Roger Bartlett in The Great Escape in 1963 and, eight years later, as the mass murderer Reginald Halliday Christie in the chilling 10 Rillington Place. But Attenboroughâs real claim to greatness as an actor lies in the work he did before he was 40, and which established him as a landmark figure in British culture. Normally, retrospectives have to wait until someone dies. That should not be so in Richard Attenboroughâs case: we should savour his films while he is still with us, and let him know in no uncertain terms how unequivocally great we feel his achievement is.","Actor and director Attenborough has suffered ill health since stroke in 2008 .

Crusading: The Guantanamo comparison was made by lawyer Phil Shiner, pictured, a long-time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan . Listeners to BBC radio were assured that it was a scandal to compare with Guantanamo Bay and the American detention of terror suspects without time limit and without trial. Breathlessly, reporters revealed that they had been given documents showing 85 Afghans were in a British holding camp near Kabul. This might amount to unlawful detention and internment, they said. A little later a familiar name appeared in the BBC reports. The Guantanamo comparison was made by crusading lawyer Phil Shiner, a long-time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Indeed, it was Mr Shiner who led the case that ended with a 2010 High Court block on the transfer of detainees from Camp Bastion to the Afghan authorities, which compelled the British military to keep so many prisoners in detention in the first place. In January 2010 he wrote on the Guardianâs website: âMy firmâs next case focuses on the UKâs detention policy in Afghanistan, where we routinely hand over Afghans to the Afghan authorities in full knowledge of the torture, summary executions and disappearances occurring within their facilities.â Mr Shiner, 56, was a Birmingham University graduate who became an articled clerk and then a solicitor in the city. He worked for a decade for legal firms, a council estate project, a law centre and the Barnardoâs charity before founding his own firm in 1999. The father of five is also a visiting professor at London Metropolitan University, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, and was awarded the title âHuman Rights Lawyer of the Yearâ in 2004. He has repeatedly denied that he is an âambulance chaserâ and calls the idea that he trawls for workâ laughableâ. His firm, Public Interest Lawyers, made its name in Iraq, where Mr Shiner represented alleged victims of abuses by British troops, including relatives of Baha Mousa, who died in 2003 in British custody. Nearly Â£3million has been paid in compensation to the family of Mr Mousa and other men. Mr Shiner sent a representative to Iraq to find and interview people who claimed to have been harmed by the British, and their claims were brought to the British courts. Public Interest Lawyers says it is currently acting for more than 130 former detainees who allege that they or their family members were unlawfully detained, ill-treated, or killed by UK forces in Iraq. Controversial: The detention facility at Camp Bastion, where the BBC said up to 90 Afghans are held . The firmâs interests are, however, not exclusively abroad. It says its mission is âhelping individuals like you challenge the unlawful behaviour of those who govern us both nationally and locallyâ. Its most recent highly-publicised domestic case was last month when it represented a campaign group who objected to the use of unpaid workers in Surrey libraries on the grounds they had not received equality training. It won the case and the county council was barred by a High Court judge from using volunteers to work in its libraries. This was, said Mr Shiner, a âfantastic resultâ. The libraries are now threatened with closure.","The Guantanamo comparison was made by .

Coaches at a high school in the U.S. face losing their jobs after they forced teenage athletes to 'bear crawl' around a running track as punishment for missing practice. Some of the students - including one girl of just 14 - were left with bloodied and blistered hands after being made to make numerous laps of the track on all fours. Cascade High School has apologised to parents for the 'inappropriate behaviour' of the four varsity track team coaches, who have all been suspended and are being urged to resign. Blisters: Student athletes were left with blistered, blackened hands after they were forced to 'bear crawl' around the track for missing practice . 'Bear crawl': A student demonstrates the way the pupils were made to walk around the track at their high school in Indiana . The punishments were doled out after just 12 students turned up for track practice at the school last Friday, according to a report on Wthr.com. 'Some missed because they had to do stuff for prom. One kid had a basketball game. One girl had a doctor's appointment and was told she had to do four laps,' one Cascade High School student said. Painful: All four varsity track team coaches have been suspended from their positions at Cascade High pending the outcome of an investigation . 'Inappropriate': The school has issued an apology to parents, some of whom have called for the coaches to be sacked . Many of the students were left with large blisters after completing their 'bear crawls'. Outcry: Some members of the varsity track team at the high school have spoken out in defence of their coaches . From . a standing position the students were told to lean over and lay their . hands on the ground, using both their hands and feet to make their way . awkwardly around the track. 'They were all black, and these were really red and they hurt even right now,' one girl said of her injured hands. Some parents of Cascade High pupils have called for the coaches to be sacked, but many members of the varsity track team spoke out in their defence and said they were appalled to hear of their suspension. Athlete Matt Shepard, who did not sustain blisters while bear crawling around the track, said the coaches 'didn't intend for us to get hurt'. Fellow track team member Regina Solik said: 'I don't think there's a single person on this track team that says ""I want them fired"".' She added that the coaches cared a great deal about the students they train. The school district has contacted the Indiana Department of Child Services in light of the incident. Assistant Superintendent Dr Jill Jay said in a statement the school did not condone or tolerate such behaviour from its employees. She added that all four members of staff had been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation into the incident, and that they had been asked to resign from their coaching positions.","Four track team coaches suspended for 'inappropriate' behaviour .

Fate sealed by the Moon: General Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson was shot by his own troops who could only see his silhouette in the moonlight . Astronomers have cleared up the mystery of how Confederate general Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson was accidentally shot and killed by his own soldiers. General Jackson was a major figure in the American Civil War, a genius general and second in command to Confederate general Robert E. Lee. He was shot by his own troops during the Battle of Chancellorsville on May 2, 1863, and died soon after, an incident widely regarded as a turning point in the fight between North and South. Now a reconstruction of the Moon's cycle at the time of the friendly fire incident has explained how General Jackson's own troops could have mistaken him for the enemy. That fateful night, General Jackson kept his troops, who were fresh from a major victory against the Union's Twelfth Corps, fighting even as the Sun set - a rare move in that time. But as the South's soldiers fought on under the moonlight, a Confederate officer on the left flank of the 18th North Carolina regiment spotted a group of riders headed towards his position. It was General Jackson and his command unit. But fearing the enemy was upon them, Major John Barry ordered his soldiers to fire on the riders, riddling the group with bullets. General Jackson was hit in his right wrist and left arm, which had to be amputated, and died eight days later after catching pneumonia. Now astronomers say they have worked out why Major Barry and his soldiers didn't recognize their commanders, and it's because the position of the Moon meant they appeared only as silhouettes to the men in their own lines. Astronomer Don Olson of Texas State University and Laurie Jasinski, a researcher and editor at the Texas State Historical Association, used astronomical software to calculate the Moon's position on the night of the battle. Battle plans: The positions of the Confederate . (black) and Union (blue) lines at Chancellorsville, as . well as the relative position of the moon, which meant the South's . soldiers didn't recognize their commander . They also scoured historical accounts . and battle maps to work out exactly where the 18th North Carolina . regiment and General Jackson's party were placed at the time of the . shooting - about 9pm. Professor Olson told SPACE.com: . 'Once we calculated the compass direction of the moon and compared that . to the detailed battle maps published by Robert Krick, it quickly . became obvious how Stonewall Jackson would have been seen as a dark . silhouette, from the point of view of the 18th North Carolina regiment.' General Jackson's death was seen as a major blow for . the Confederacy, affecting not only its military prospects, but also the . morale of its army and of the general public. Jackson in death became . an icon of Southern heroism and commitment, joining Lee in the pantheon . of the 'Lost Cause'. Still . regarded as one of U.S. history's greatest tacticians, historians still . debate whether the outcome of the whole Civil War might have been . altered if he had survived. Illustration showing Stonewall Jackson with his troops at Bull Run, July 21, 1861 . His Valley Campaign and his . envelopment of the Union Army right wing at Chancellorsville are studied . worldwide even today as examples of innovative and bold leadership. He excelled as well in other battles; . the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) where he received his . famous nickname 'Stonewall', Second Bull Run (Second Manassas), . Antietam, and Fredericksburg. Jackson was not universally successful . as a commander, however, as displayed by his weak and confused efforts . during the Seven Days Battles around Richmond in 1862. He was greatly admired and respected throughout the South, and his death had a profound effect there on civilians and soldiers alike. A poem penned by one of his soldiers soon became a very popular song, 'Stonewall Jackson's Way'. A stone marks the spot where Stonewall Jackson was shot Guinea, Virginia . On learning of his injuries, General Lee wrote to Jackson stating: 'Could I have directed events, I would have chosen for the good of the country to be disabled in your stead.' This isn't the first time that Professor Olson has used astronomy to clear up other historical mysteries. He . has previously calculated the direction of moonlight on the night of . Paul Revere's ride to warn Colonial militia of the advance of British . forces to explain why he wasn't spotted by sentries on a Royal Navy . warship. And he did the same to explain how sailors on Japan's I-58 submarine were able to spot and sink the USS Indianapolis in 1945. 'We are always interested in any historical event that happened at night - very often, the moon plays an important role, as happened here,' he added. Professor Olson and Mr Jasinski reported their findings in the May 2013 issue of Sky & Telescope magazine.

A dying, paralyzed shooting victim who couldn't speak, intentionally blinked his eyes to identify a photo of his attacker for authorities, prosecutors have said in the opening statements of the suspect's murder trial. Defese lawyers in the trial of alleged killer Ricardo Woods say blinking cannot be considered consistent, reliable evidence. Over the next few weeks, jurors will be asked to decide whether Woods killed David Chandler, of Cincinnati. Incident: David Chandler, left, identified, 34-year-old Ricardo Woods (right), who has now been charged with murder, felonious assault and weapons counts and faces up to life in prison if convicted . Paralyzed and hooked up to a . ventilator, David Chandler was two weeks from death when police arrived . at his hospital room to question him about the person who shot him. They . wanted to know if he could identify a suspect, and they had a photo to . show him. Chandler was unable to communicate . except with his eyes as he lay in bed attached to myriad tubes and with a . brace around his neck. His eyes opened barely more than a slit at . times; he was instructed to blink three times for yes and twice for no. One detective quizzed him, and another videotaped his responses. Chandler . didn't respond with blinks to every question in the 17-minute video, . and there were solo blinks. But triple blinks came in response to . repeated questions asking if he knew the shooter and whether the person . in the photo was the culprit. Legal experts say such cases - while not unheard of - are unusual, and dying identifications relying on gestures rather than words are often not used in trials because of concern over reliability or differing interpretations. But some have been used in murder cases around the country that have ended in convictions. Suspect: Ricardo Woods is led out of the courtroom last year after the murder trial was postponed . Police . asked Chandler to blink three times for yes and twice for no to a . series of questions in the interview, said Assistant Hamilton County . Prosecutor David Prem. Chandler also blinked yes to indicate . that he knew the gunman and that his name began with the letter O, Prem . said. O was a street name that Woods sometimes used, the prosecutor . said. Prem told jurors that when they view the video, they will clearly see that Chandler knew what he was doing. 'You are going to see how he was struggling to get it right,' Prem said. The motive for the shooting, the prosecutor said, was that Chandler owed Woods money for drugs. Chandler was a drug user who had . bought drugs many times from Woods but had gone to an area near Woods' home the night of the shooting with two friends to buy drugs from . someone else. Chandler was shot about 20 yards from Woods' home and in an area known for drug deals, he said. Familiar: Woods reportedly knew the victim through drug deals . Prem said that while neither of the . men in the car with Chandler could clearly identify the man who shot . him, one heard a voice yelling Chandler's name. Defense attorney Wendy Calaway . insisted that Woods did not shoot Chandler and is 'an innocent man who . found himself in a perfect storm of misinformation and . misidentification'. Calaway said Chandler had stolen drugs from dealers . previously. 'He had many enemies,' Calaway said of Chandler. He had received threats and was . considered a 'snitch' who informed on drug dealers to police, according . to Calaway. Police decided before their investigation was completed that . Woods was the shooter and never followed up on any other leads, Calaway . said. Calaway also focused on the blinking . identification, saying that while doctors were able to establish a 'rudimentary' communication system with Chandler, 'his blinks were . inconsistent and sporadic'. Law: Judge Beth Myers of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court ruled at an earlier hearing that jurors could see the videotape, saying she found the blinks reliable . He only blinked in response to doctors' commands about 50 percent of the time, she said. Both sides are expected to call . medical experts to testify about the ability of someone in Woods' condition to understand and respond to questions. Other witnesses expected to be called . include a priest who was a friend to Chandler and gave him money before . the shooting, Prem said. A man who was in jail with Woods will testify . that Woods told him that he didn't mean to kill Chandler but that he was . angry that Chandler owed him money for drugs and was trying to buy . drugs from someone else, Prem said. The judge has said that the trial could take up to three weeks. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","David Chandler was left paralysed after he was shot and could only communicate by blinking .

Panic: Business Secretary Vince Cable warned public fears over immigration risked harming the economy . Britainâs economy is being damaged by public âpanicâ over immigration, Vince Cable warned today. The Business Secretary claimed government policy aimed at cutting the number of people moving to the UK were deterring investors and created âabsurdâ obstacles for students. He was backed by London Mayor Boris Johnson who warned ambitions to reduce immigration must not be met by cutting the number of foreign students signing up to UK universities. David Cameron has said he wants to see net migration fall to the âtens of thousandsâ by 2015. Official figures last week showed the number of immigrants coming into Britain has fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade. Half a million from abroad came to live here in the 12 months to the end of last September, the smallest number since 2001. But much of the drop came from a 22 per cent decrease in the number of foreign students. However, Mr Cable said that because overseas students were counted as immigrants under international rules, their number was âeasily translated into a flood of immigrantsâ. He added: âWhen, last week, the number declines, this is a great triumph for immigration control, which is quite absurd and unfortunately is seriously distorting the debate on sensible university policy and, indeed, sensible immigration policy. âI just want to make absolutely clear, as far as the Government is concerned we have no cap on the number of overseas students, we don't propose to introduce one.â The Business Secretary warned the debate over immigration âdoes incubate these very deep emotional feelings about foreignersâ. âI was at one of our leading engineering companies a few months ago. âI was introduced to the chief engineer, who was making the most sophisticated engines for Formula 1 cars and he happened to be Indian, and he was coming to the end of his visa and under the existing rules he was going to have to go back to India and reapply for admission to the UK, right in the middle of a high-pressure contract. It was completely absurd. âBut that is the kind of restriction that is introduced in order to placate public panic that does create an economic harm.â Drop: Net migration is now at its lowest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics show . In a speech to the Global University Summit in London, Mr Cable acknowledged there was a âserious problemâ of perception which had been caused by the Government's immigration restrictions, particularly in India. âIn India there has been a quite vigorous criticism of the UK, largely I think following the debate in British newspapers and treating that as if it was objective reality, which it isn't necessarily,â Mr Cable said. London Mayor Boris Johnson said a drop in foreign students to the UK was not something to be celebrated . âIn some of the Indian vernacular . newspapers the message has gone out that the British no longer want . Indian students, which is wrong but that's the message that has gone . out.â There had been a âsubstantialâ reduction in the number of Indian students as a result, he added. Mr Cable's concerns about a reduction in foreign students were echoed by London Mayor Boris Johnson at the same event. Mr Johnson said: âI looked at the recent figures for foreign students coming to this country and I do not regard what seemed to me to be a reduction in those numbers as necessarily a positive economic indicator. âI think we need to push higher education as a great, great international export and we need to be even more open in our dealings with other HE institutions around the world.â Planning minister Nick Boles last night warned immigration is helping to fuel rises in house prices that are preventing young people from owning their own home . He told the Mail: âI have become much more critical of immigration. 'A very substantial contribution to housing need comes from the level of immigration in the past two decades.â","Business Secretary warns attempts to cut immigrant numbers deters wealthy investors .

He's famous for his ravishingly modernist work but designer Gareth Pugh has revealed that his inspiration is firmly rooted in the past. And while the Tudor monarchs that so fascinate him might not have had pinstripe suits and ties, they were, says Pugh, the world's first power dressers. Just as designers in the 1980s used shoulder pads to give the illusion of broad shoulders and size, so Elizabeth I and her father Henry VIII used triangular-shaped garments to create a 'silhouette of power', Pugh points out. Scroll down for video . Back to the future: Designer Gareth Pugh with designs inspired by the Tudor and Stuart periods . Power dressing: Pugh's Elizabethan style ruffs and armour inspired designs on the catwalk in Paris . 'Their [clothes] are definitely devices of subliminal power,â Pugh says. âIâm very much taken by the idea of the Tudors being the first power dressers â that idea of using clothes for more purpose than just clothing oneself. '[It is interesting] how things were started by the monarch, then copied by the court, . then by the merchants and the middle classes. 'It was that trickle-down . effect that people still talk about today with fashion and it's . fascinating that that was happening 400 to 500 years ago as well. âItâs clothing to present oneself in a particular way, asserting yourself through what you wear.â And he's not wrong. In 1666, Charles II announced that he was to introduce a new fashion for men â a long vest worn under a coat, instead of a short doublet and cloak. Later to become the three-piece suit, the style spread so quickly that three weeks later the diarist Samuel Pepys was wearing his own version. Pugh's own work, which he describes as âa kind of modern armourâ, is replete with references to 15th century garb, and has included reworked versions of the Elizabethan ruff, as well as a wearable spin on King Henry VIII's famously large suit of armour. It's a far cry from the reliably feminine work of Alberta Ferretti and others, but then, as Pugh puts it: 'Fashion isnât really about clothes. Itâs more about an idea, an alternate reality.' His alternate reality, more often than not, is a Tudor one - something which came about after a memorable trip to London as a child. Power dressing: The triangular shapes favoured by Charles I (left) and Elizabeth I emphasised their royal status . 'I first became interested in the Tudors and Stuarts when I was very young. I remember being brought down to London for the first time and I was with my dad and brother who were coming to watch Sunderland play at Wembley. 'Because my mum didn't want me to feel left out, because I wasn't that much into football, she took me round the tower of London and [bought me] a magazine [there]. 'I remember the first issue: it was all about Queen Elizabeth I and it came with all these little costume things so you could dress them up, and I remember I wasn't very good at drawing heads, so I would get my mum and dad to draw the heads, and then I would draw in the outfit from the neck down.' So fond of the period is the designer, . he's teamed up with the Royal Collection to produce a potted history of . Tudor fashion ahead of the launch of In Fine Style: The Art of Tudor and Stuart Fashion - the summer exhibition at Buckingham Palace. 'It's very much about presenting oneself as an icon I guess... It's very powerful,' added the designer. 'You can sometimes be a little lazy when you look at paintings â you focus on the face,' he added. 'This exhibition has much more of an emphasis on whatâs happening from the neck down â and as a fashion designer thatâs my currency. Inspiring: Pugh first became interested in the Tudor period following a visit to the Tower of London as a child . Power: According to Pugh, the Tudor triangular silhouette was the 15th century equivalent of shoulder pads . Beginning with the early 16th . century, the exhibition traces the changing tastes of the royal courts . and the spread of fashion through Europe, much of which boasts the . triangular shape that has become Pugh's trademark. 'I love triangles,' he adds. 'You know in physics, . the triangle is the strongest shape known to man. 'It's all very subtle . but in the end it all comes down to that silhouette of power and that's . something I like to inject into my own work.' 'These garments served a function and are as important as the portraits themselves â it was their language and how they communicated on a non-verbal level.

David Cameron has been condemned for flying out of the country on a week's family holiday as Britain faced its biggest terror crisis since the 7/7 bombings in 2005. MPs are said to be outraged as it emerged the Prime Minister has taken a 'few days break' over the Bank Holiday on the Spanish island of Ibiza. But Downing Street hit back at the criticism today and said he 'remains in charge' despite being abroad. It comes as a Conservative backbencher today warned that the Prime Minister may only have a year to save his job. Mr Cameron went on a mid-morning flight yesterday with his wife Samantha and their children Nancy, Elwen and Florence. Scroll down for video .

MP for Bury St Edmunds, David Ruffley said today the Prime Minister has to win the argument on the EU in the coming year or UKIP will split the Tory vote at the European Elections in 12 months. 'I think next Mayâs euro elections might put pressure on him to go harder because there is a lot of speculation in and around Downing Street, so I am led to believe, that UKIP might come first, ' he said. 'Now if that happens next May thereâll be 12 months before the election and some of our colleagues in marginal seats might get a bit windy. 'I donât think UKIP are going to win seats but they could split the Conservative vote if they are very strong and let Labour through in those marginal seats. 'But I think David Cameron has got 12 months to show that his strategy works.' UKIP leader Nigel Farage said today that his party is 'in talks all over the place' with Tory politicans keen to join him, with 'around 20' Eurosceptic MPs willing to stand on a Conservative/UKIP joint ticket in the 2015 general election, he said. Warning: Tory MP David Ruffley (left) says David Cameron has got 12 months to show that his strategy works' or face losing voters to Nigel Farage's UKIP . Mr Cameron has also come under fire from backbencher Douglas Carswell, who accused ministers of allowing civil servants to take over the Government. He said: âI think we need to actually take on the Mandarinate, who all too often seem to be really running this government, and that is the fundamental problem.â But Mr Carswell dismissed pressure for a leadership election, saying: âIt would be extraordinarily disruptive.â However, up to four groups of MPs are said to be plotting about Mr Cameronâs future. Allies of backbencher Adam Afriyie are urging him to make fresh interventions to burnish his own leadership credentials. The Prime Minister's family break trip came just two days after he chaired a meeting of the Cabinet emergency committee Cobra to discuss the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London, and the arrest of two suspected Islamic extremists. Labour MP Sarah Champion said Mr Cameronâs decision to take a break showed he was 'utterly out of touch.' She told the Sun: 'While the country . struggles to come to terms with the vile crime in Woolwich this week and . investigations continue, he has swanned off to Ibiza.

Backing the Prime Minister: Tory MP Nadine Dorries . Another wrote: 'Britain on terror alert. David Cameron on holiday in ibiza. About right then.' Mrs Cameron is known to value private . holidays with the family and the Prime Minister has admitted in the past . that she insists they get away together. Mr Cameron has been accompanied by a small team of key staff and is being kept up to date over developments in the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby. Amid suggestions he should have remained in the country, Mr Cameron won support from an unlikely source. Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries, a well-known critic of her party's leader, said it was 'ridiculous' to criticise him for having a few days away' She told Murnaghan on Sky News: ""We have got the internet, we've got mobile phones. I think Cameron could actually get back from Ibiza to London quicker than if he was in Cornwall. 'I think he is entitled to a holiday, he's entitled to be with his family. I actually want the Prime Minister to be refreshed, feeling happy because he's had holiday time with his kids and his wife and come back and be a refreshed Prime Minister.'

The U.S. government has pushed back the deadline for people in Boston to file their tax returns as the city struggles to come to terms with Monday's devastating bomb attacks. The twin explosions that left three dead and 183 injured at the Boston Marathon took place on Tax Day - when individual income tax returns must be filed with the federal government. But the Internal Revenue Service announced a three-month extension for taxpayers in Boston in light of the 'terrible tragedy', adding that people in the city needed more time. 'Terrible tragedy': The IRS said people in Boston who need more time to complete their tax returns can have a three-month extension 'without worry' following the devastating events of Monday . The Boston Marathon is held on Patriots' Day, the third Monday in April, on which MassachusettsÂ  commemorates the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775. This year Patriots' Day fell on April 15 - the date on which Tax Day typically falls. 'Our hearts go out to the people affected by this tragic event,' said IRS Acting Commissioner Steven T. Miller. 'We want victims and others affected by this terrible tragedy to have the time they need to finish their individual tax returns.' The IRS said the relief would apply to all individual taxpayers living in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, including the city of Boston. City in mourning: People gathered for a vigil on Boston Common yesterday as the investigation into the fatal bombings continues . It also includes victims, their . families, first responders, others living outside of Suffolk County that . were affected by the bombings, and taxpayers whose tax preparers were . adversely affected, the IRS said. Eligible taxpayers will be issued a notice giving them until July 15 to file their 2012 tax returns . and pay any taxes normally due on April 15. Boston is a city in mourning after two bombs exploded seconds apart close to the finish line of the annual marathon on Monday afternoon. Martin Richard, aged eight, died in the blasts, as did 29-year-old restaurant manager Krystle Campbell and 23-year-old Chinese graduate student LÃ¼ Lingzi. Martin, who had been enjoying a day out watching the race with his family on Monday, had just gone to get an ice cream before returning to the finish line to watch the runners coming past. The little boy was killed by the second of the two blasts that went off shortly before 3 p.m. His younger sister Jane lost a leg, and his mother Denise was hospitalized after sustaining a brain injury. Described by her heartbroken father as 'the best person you'd ever meet', Ms Campbell was at the marathon with her friend Karen Rand, cheering on Ms Rand's boyfriend. Lingzi was said to have been 'living her dream' of studying in the U.S. An investigation is underway into who was responsible for the deadly attacks. President Barack Obama has said the culprits will 'feel the full weight of justice.'","Boston Marathon took place on April 15, which was Tax Day in the U.S.

"By . Janet Street Porter . PUBLISHED: . 17:23 EST, 31 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:06 EST, 2 April 2013 . When I heard mums get asked more questions per hour than David Cameron faces at Prime Minister's Questions, I wasn't surprised. Girls aged four are the most persistent interrogators, demanding an astonishing 390 answers every day. Mums have taken to searching the internet for help with explaining why the sky is blue and water is wet. I sympathise - I was an irritatingly curious child, but the trouble is I've never got out of the habit. Every day dozens of questions about modern life bubble up through my consciousness, demanding answers. Janet Street-Porter would like to know if Boris would be so funny with neat hair, and why Pippa Middleton has been given a column about food when she clearly doesn't eat all that much . Sadly, I never receive any. And, judging by my postbag, you feel the same. What we need instead of a radio show called Any Answers - hosted by Jonathan Dimbleby, on which politicians never give any answers, just a load of the same old waffling rubbish - is a show called Real Answers To Troubling Dilemmas. I would gladly be the host, because it's bound to be a smash hit. Here are some of the recurring Big Questions that clog up my brain day in and day out, and which no politician or expert has been able to answer: . 1. Why does Pippa write about feasts in a food magazine when she obviously doesn't eat much? 2. Sorry, another Pippa question, but she is a modern enigma. Why does she outline her eyes with that black stuff - is it to make sure we know that those two little white things with pupils in them next to her nose are eyes, not ears? (That's how I feel about lip-liner, too.) 3. How does Nick Clegg 'feel our pain'? He hasn't given birth, stayed at home to breastfeed his babies or given up his career to be a house husband. We know he can cry (OK, snivel) and look sad, and is probably henpecked. But is he a vertebrate that has pain sensors? 4. Does David Tennant have more than two expressions: cross and even crosser? Does he put stuff in his eyes so they look very white on telly? 5. Does Boris ever comb his hair or is it part of his brand? If he combed it, would his brain work differently and be less 'fun'? 6. Is anyone going to take the blame for failures in the NHS? How many deaths in an NHS hospital does it take for one executive to hand in their notice? Does ten grannies, a couple of babies, half a dozen mums and five old men wasting away from preventable bugs and infection add up to enough human misery for one highly paid NHS executive to give up their pension? 7. If we spend so much time moaning about kids leaving school illiterate, why don't we spend more money on teachers and reduce class sizes? 8. The complexities of modern language. What does the word 'luxury' mean when written on a Hilton Hotel emery board? Likewise, the words 'limited edition' splashed across a Marks & Spencer bag of rocket salad? Luxury once meant something we couldn't afford. Limited edition meant an artwork. Now they mean dog biscuits and panty liners - help, guidance needed! 9. Are benefits being reduced or not? According to one minister, Iain Duncan Smith, claimants will see benefits rise year on year. According to Minister for Disabled People, Esther McVey, the bill will be cut. Is this mysterious thing called a Benefits Bill a bit like my pension schemes: a bit of paper that arrives once a year and is completely incomprehensible? 10. I didn't get the UK in a financial mess. Neither did you. We didn't speculate on currencies, futures, derivatives, dodgy mortgages or commodities. I pay all my tax in the UK every year - and so do most of you. So why are we asked to tighten our belts, accept lower wages, work fewer hours, pay higher taxes and cough up more to eat, travel and heat our homes? In short, why am I sending a bigger proportion of what I earn back to George Osborne to pay off some debt I didn't cause in the first place? Just thought I'd ask! STONES STUCK IN THE MUD . Keith Richards and Mick Jagger . The Rolling Stones play Glastonbury - a month before Mick turns 70. As a youthful pensioner, I should be celebrating, but I find it deeply depressing. The Stones are smug and unthreatening, a showband charging ludicrous prices for old hits. Punk and protest and confrontation in pop have been replaced by bland cosiness, like the other headline act at Glasto, Mumford & Sons. As a teenager I watched the Stones rehearse in Soho and noted every appearance in my diary. They represented everything the establishment found threatening -sex with anyone you fancied, drugs and radical politics. The Stones got stuck in a rut - they rarely collaborate with young musicians to re-invent themselves. I wouldn't wear a frock from 1963, so why listen to this old stuff? BEING YOUNG ISN'T A CRIME . L plates . Young people in Barnsley can no longer go out at night without being accompanied by an adult. To fight antisocial behaviour, a curfew has been imposed on under-16s between 9pm and 6am in parts of the town. A good idea on one level, but it smacks of desperation. The sight of coppers frog-marching home any teenager who dares to pop out for a beer with their mates fills me with gloom. Loafing about at night is what teenagers have always done. I spent hours mincing past my chip shop in the hope of attracting one spotty youth. Surely police efforts should be focused on known troublemakers, ensuring that young people have places such as under-used church halls to go to and let off steam? In another worrying development, the Government is considering imposing a curfew on young drivers, too, and extending the time during which their licence can be revoked if they incur more than six penalty points. Motoring organisations want newly qualified drivers banned from the road between 11pm and 4am, to be allowed only one passenger under 20 and to lose their licence if theyâve consumed alcohol. These measures might sound good in theory, but what is needed is better education for drivers and more access to motor workshops and apprenticeships for car-crazy boys and girls. At this rate, we might as well lock up all under-16s each night so they canât smoke, drink, swear, drive or breathe anywhere we donât approve of. Only joking! SEW IT UP . Claudia Winkleman . Sewing is one of the most restful hobbies. As a teenager, I made all my own clothes, re-cutting patterns to make skinny shift dresses, tight Bermuda shorts and shirts with curvy collars. As an architecture student, I designed and stitched silver coats and skirts for a trendy shop in Carnaby Street, so I was never exactly a poor student, though my college work probably suffered as a result. I was thrilled to find a new BBC2 series about dressmaking starts tomorrow at 8pm - until I read the host is that female faucet of mindless gush, stick insect fashionista Claudia Winkleman. She probably irons her hair, not her paper patterns, and knows as much about sewing as Sue Perkins does about baking. The BBC says looks don't matter when they choose their female presenters. You can't pull the darning wool over my eyes. PASS THE BUCKET, MRS CARTER . Beyonce . I couldn't face watching the BBC's Imagine on Beyonce. The singer wrote it, directed it, starred in it and it was all about her favourite subject - herself. Beyonce wore a leather corset reminiscent of a hi-tech cheese cutter to perform at the Superbowl. She says she's a feminist and is headlining a charity concert in London on June 1 to promote women's rights, produced by the team responsible for Live Aid and sponsored by Gucci. The superstar just happens to be touring Europe with her Mrs Carter tour - referring to her married name. She says: 'I need to find a new word for feminism...like bootylicious.' That sounds about as empowering as her crotch-hugging leather knickers. I feel a bit queasy.","Our columnist also takes on Pippa Middleton, Nick Clegg and David Tennant .

The number of plastic bags blighting Britainâs beaches has rocketed by a fifth in a year â despite vows by the Coalition to tackle the issue. Some 72 throwaway carrier bags are now littering every mile of coastline, posing a devastating threat to marine and bird life such as turtles and gulls. Beaches in Kent, Dorset, Devon, East Sussex and Yorkshire were named the worst offenders as campaigners accused the government of âempty promisesâ. Under threat: British beautyspots like Tynemouth, North Tyneside and marine life are under threat from the growing problem of waste plastic bags - which Britain chose not to ban under EU law . Preservation: Volunteers also found double the number of cigarette butts, ruining beautiful scenery like Sennen beach, Cornwall . England now remains the only part of the UK with no firm proposals to tackle the issue, after Scotland pledged to introduce charges and fees in Northern Ireland and Wales have seen bag use drop by up to 96 per cent in some supermarkets. The figures, revealed in a report by the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), are a blow to the Daily Mailâs Banish The Bags campaign â which calls on companies and politicians to reduce the number of plastic bags in our countryside and rivers. The charity found that despite last yearâs wet weather keeping many families away from the coast, litter rose by three per cent to reach its highest level since 2008. Dr Rob Keirle of the MCS said the environment secretary âshould be embarrassedâ. âDavid Cameron promised this would be the greenest Government ever â it is probably the emptiest promise ever made, because they have done so little for the environment,â he said. âThe biggest disappointment is that the UK Government in England has done very little, while smaller economies in Wales and Northern Ireland have imposed a charge to reduce unnecessary waste. Eyesore: The Daily Mail's Banish The Bags campaign calls on companies and politicians to reduce the number of plastic bags . Blight: A recent survey found on average 72 plastic bags were found per mile on UK coast . âThese figures show that there is a lot more work to be done. Plastic bags and other waste hangs around for years. Even if we act now, it will still have an impact on the next generation.â The figures were recorded in September last year in the charityâs annual Beachwatch survey, in which 3,366 volunteers helped clean 238 beaches across Britain. Although the number of bags per mile dropped from 70 in 2010 to 61 in 2011, it rose again last year to 72 â an 18 per cent leap. Shakespeare beach in Dover, Kent, was one the worst for rubbish with 68 bags full of litter collected by volunteers, followed by Chesil Cove in Dorset where they filled 60 bags with discarded waste. Slapton Sands in Devon, Spurn nature reserve in East Yorkshire and Brighton beach were also among the top five. MCS volunteers also found double the number of cigarette butts, while smoking-related litter such as lighters and empty packets rose by 90 per cent in a year. Almost two-thirds of the total litter was plastic, with 120 disposable bottles per mile. The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs said it was âdisappointedâ with the figures. âPicking up rubbish is costly for local authorities and that money can be put to better use,â said a spokesman. In March, actor Jeremy Irons called on lawmakers to tackle the âcurable problemâ of plastic bags as he backed the Daily Mailâs campaign.","Beaches in Kent, Dorset, Devon, and Yorkshire were worst affected .

Justin Bieber has been hit with a bill for thousands of dollars by the German animal shelter where his confiscated pet monkey has been held for two months. The 19-year-old singer has until midnight to reclaim Mally, a capuchin monkey, and will have to pay up for his care even if he does not take the animal back. Mally will be transferred to a permanent home at a German zoo or animal park if Bieber does not take him back in time. Scroll down for video . Justin Bieber, seen last night in a recording studio, has until midnight to reclaim Mally the monkey from a Munich animal shelter . Stranger moments: Justin's monkey Mally was confiscated while on tour in Germany . 'If no further documents arrive then the seizure order comes into effect and the animal becomes the property of the German state,' said Munich customs office spokesman Thomas Meister. Mally was seized by German customs March 28 when Bieber failed to produce required vaccination and import papers after landing in Munich while on tour. The monkey was given to the singer for his 19th . birthday last month from music producer Jamal 'Mally Mal' Rashid and had . been taken away from his mother when he was only nine weeks old. The now 20-week-old animal was quarantined and cared for at Munich's animal shelter, where manager Karl Heinz Joachim said Mally had fared well and gained weight. The shelter has criticized Bieber for keeping such a young monkey as a pet, saying it shouldn't have been taken away from its mother until it was a year old. Experts say capuchin monkeys also need to be kept in groups as they are very sociable animals. Bieber must pay for Mally's care whether he takes the monkey back or not . 'The best thing would be not to buy one at all, but if you do, buy five,' said Mr Joachim. He said emails from Bieber's management to the animal shelter indicated the singer does not want the monkey anymore, but that the final decision would have to be made by German authorities. 'Our contact is the person that the monkey belongs to,' said Mr Meister. 'We've had contact with lots of people but none of them was an authorised representative.' He said the cost of care, food and vet visits at the Munich shelter amounted to several thousand (dollars). 'You can bet we are going to ask for that money back,' he said. Mally the monkey is now in quarantine at a German animal shelter . The capuchin monkey, taken from its mother at nine weeks, is treating a cuddly toy as its surrogate parent . Normally capuchin monkeys remain with their mothers for at least the first year of their life. He is now in quarantine in a Munich animal sanctuary where his only companion is a cuddly toy that he treats as a surrogate mother. Mally also spends his time repeatedly calling out in the hope of finding other members of his family group - something which Mr Joachim, 64, described last month as 'heartbreaking'. He said at the time: 'Justin Bieber has won an extension because the four week limit on confiscated animals only applies if the owner does not get in touch. 'However his management team had been in touch and indicated that they want the monkey back which means they now have as much time as they need to get the paperwork ready. 'If that takes months then it's months that they have. But that just isn't acceptable for the baby monkey needs company and to be with other monkeys at this crucial age in its life. 'We'll appeal to the star to do the decent thing and let the monkey be free for adoption. 'There are a great many suitable . places that have offered to take Mally and integrate him with their own . capuchin monkeys where he would be much more happy with his own kind. 'A baby monkey is not something suitable to be on a world tour even if he is travelling by private jet. 'He . should be out in the wild climbing trees and learning from other . monkeys if he isn't to have serious psychological problems later in . life.' The boss of the Munich animal shelter asked Bieber to do 'the decent thing' and let the animal be adopted . Mally spends his time repeatedly calling in the hope of finding other members of his family group, animal shelter staff said . A German customs spokesman said at the time of the confiscation that Bieber lacked documents certifying compliance with animal health and species-protection regulations. Mr Joachim said if it took months to sort out the paperwork and all that time was spent in a cage it would do irreparable damage to the monkey's mental state. He said if Bieber were to refuse to allow the monkey to be adopted by a suitable organisation then the only hope lay with the Bavarian environment ministry. However the Ministry has so far declined to comment on the case.","Mally the capuchin monkey was held by customs officials in Munich .

Brooklyn's District Attorney Charles Hynes has been accused of using hotel rooms as 'private jails' in a lawsuit . Brooklyn's District Attorney has been accused of using locked hotel rooms as 'private jails' to interrogate witnesses and pressure them into giving false testimony in court. The office of Charles Hynes is said to have routinely held trial witnesses against their will, according to new court papers filed by a lawyer representing a man suing for $150million for a wrongful murder conviction. In court papers, Joel Rudin said: 'Hynes's office was running a private . jail system where witnesses were illegally interrogated and forcibly . detained indefinitely.' The papers were filed in connection with a lawsuit by Rudin's client Jabbar Collins, who spent 15 years in jail for the murder of a Brooklyn rabbi. His conviction was overturned when it emerged that key prosecution witnesses had been coerced into giving false testimony by prosecutors and police. During a deposition, former DA's office employee Christopher Salsarulo described how witnesses were treated during their detention. He said: 'Once they're handcuffed, . they're in their underwear and you speak to them a little bit more, ""Are . you going to fight us? You like pants?""' 'You know, if that's the case, if . theyâre compliant, we dress them and give them water, whatever they need . so they would be comfortable.' Rudin also highlighted evidence from paralegal Liz Fitzgerald, who said that prosecutors' signatures on arrest warrants were forged by paralegals on their behalf, which is illegal. He wants Hynes and prosecutor Michael Vecchione to face a deposition over the allegations, reports the New York Times. The judge who overturned Collins' conviction for the 1995 murder of Abraham Pollack said Vecchione had threatened a heroin addict with physical harm and prosecution if he did not testify for the prosecution. The hotel room interrogations are said to have taken place during the 1990s, reports the New York Daily News. Witnesses were arrested, held under armed guard and not allowed to make phone calls or receive visitors. They were also taken to the DA's office instead of a court in some cases, according to three former employees who have testified against the city. The lawsuit claims that prosecutors 'would gain the involuntary custody of witnesses from which he would coerce false statements and testimony'. Jerry Schmetterer, a spokesman for the Brooklyn DA's Office, told the New York Post: 'It is not - nor was it ever - the practice of this office to hold people in hotel rooms against their will without judicial intervention.' In a statement, the cityâs law department said: 'Mr Rudinâs hyperbolic characterizations of various alleged practices in the Brooklyn DA's office are irresponsible and absurd. Our court papers fully address the legal issues.'","Charles Hynes's office is said to have held witnesses in locked hotel rooms .

"By . Helen Lawson . PUBLISHED: . 07:28 EST, 10 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:32 EST, 10 May 2013 . Billions of noisy red-eyed cicadas have started to surface in North Carolina after 17 years underground. The infestation, named Brood II by scientists, has not been seen since 1996. Before that it last appeared in 1979. The . insects are harmless. They do not bite or sting, and will not crops or other animals. Lots of people will not even see them, though they could certainly hear their mating call, which was once recorded at 94 decibels. And the insects can even be transformed into a high protein, low-carb meal. Click here to open a live interactive map of the invasion . The cicadas have been living underground for 17 years and will emerge when the ground temperature hits 64F . The cicadas, seen here in North Carolina, shed their shells and spread their wings before finding a mate . The recipe book by Jenna Jadin, below, can be found here. The recipes include: . Cicada dumplings . El chirper tacos . Cica-delicious pizza . Sizzling chili cicadas . Southern cicada tartlets . Banana cicada bread . Chocolate chip trillers . Cicada-rhubarb piece . And, Ms Jadin's favourite, chocolate covered cicadas . The magicicadas are only after sex. After a few weeks up singing their loud mating call up in the trees, they will die and their offspring will go underground, not to return until 2030. Since 1996, this group of one-inch bugs, has been a few feet underground, sucking on tree roots and biding their time. They will emerge only when the ground temperature reaches precisely 64F. 'This particular brood is extremely large', pest controller Billy Tesh told NBC, who saw a swarm at a farm in Stokes County. 'I've never seen so many in one location in my life. They were on almost every blade of grass.' Sightings have been reported within North Carolina and as far away as New Jersey and Staten Island in New York. A . live online tracker by Radiolab is encouraging residents to report . ground temperatures and sightings to be passed on to scientists at the . University of Connecticut. And most customers appear to have taken Mr Tesh's advice to avoid pesticides and 'let Mother Nature take its course'. A recipe book by scientist Jenna Jadin advocates collecting the creatures for food - though not without consulting a doctor first, and not if you suffer from a nut or shellfish allergy. She told WUSA9 that about 8pm to 9pm is the prime time for cicada gathering. 'You're going to look at the low-lying shrubs on the ground,' she said. 'You're probably going to need a lot because they're great.' Ms Jardin, who wrote the book during her PhD at the University of Maryland and now works for the U.S. department of agriculture, advised grabbing the magicicadas off bushes and putting them into a paper bag or basket. 'Newly hatched cicadas, called tenerals, are considered best for eating because their shells have not hardened,' says the book. 'They should be blanched (for 4-5 minutes) soon after collection and before you eat them! 'Not only will this make their insides solidify a bit, but it will get rid of any soil bacteria that is living on or in them. You can then cook with them immediately, or freeze them.' The insects are expected to arrive in . such numbers that people from North Carolina to Connecticut will be . outnumbered roughly 600-to-1. This year's group of nagicicadas is known as Brood II and has begun to emerge on the East Coast of the States . The insects do not sting or bite and pose no threat to humans or crops . 'It's just an amazing accomplishment,' May Berenbaum, a University of Illinois entomologist, told the Associated Press. 'How can anyone not be impressed?' There are ordinary cicadas that come out every year around the world, but these are different. They are called magicicadas - as in magic - and are red-eyed. And they are seen only in the eastern half of the United States. There are 15 U.S. broods that emerge . every 13 or 17 years. Last year the swarm affected only a small . area, mostly around the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, West Virginia . and Tennessee. Next year, it is the turn of Iowa into Illinois and Missouri; and Louisiana and Mississippi. Brood . II is one of the bigger groups. Several experts say that they don't . know how many cicadas are lurking underground but that 30billion seems . like a sensible estimate. At the Smithsonian Institution, researcher Gary Hevel said it could be closer to a trillion. If 30billion magicicadas were lined up head to tail, they would reach the moon and back. 'There will be some places where it's wall-to-wall cicadas,' says University of Maryland entomologist Mike Raupp. Strength . in numbers is the key to cicada survival: There are so many of them . that the birds can't possibly eat them all, and those that are left over . are free to multiply, he says. Some . scientists think the magicicadas come out in the odd 13 and 17-year . cycles so that predators cannot match the timing and be waiting for them . in huge numbers. Another theory is that the unusual cycles ensure that different broods don't compete with each other. And there's the mystery of just how these bugs know it has been 17 years and is time to come out, instead of 15 or 16 years. 'These guys have evolved several mathematically clever tricks,' Raupp says. 'These guys are geniuses with little tiny brains.' While they stay underground, the bugs . aren't asleep. As some of the world's longest-lived insects, they go . through different growth stages and molt four times before ever getting . to the surface. They . feed on a tree fluid called xylem. Then they surface, where they molt, . leaving behind a crusty brown shell, and grow a half-inch bigger. As six-year-old Samantha Fields shows, the cicadas are harmless . Samantha has already encountered her first magicicada - and scientists say there could be between 30billion and a trillion of the insects waiting to surface . The timing of when they first come out depends purely on ground temperature. That means early May for southern areas and late May or even June for northern areas. The males come out first as nymphs, which are essentially wingless and silent juveniles, then climb on to tree branches and molt one last time, becoming adult winged cicadas. They perch on tree branches and sing, individually or in a chorus. Then when a female comes close, the males change their song, they do a dance and mate, Raupp explained. The males keep mating and eventually the female lays 600 or so eggs on the tip of a branch. The offspring then dive-bomb out of the trees, bounce off the ground and eventually burrow into the earth, he says. 'It's a treacherous, precarious life,' Raupp says. 'But somehow they make it work.'","Magicicadas have begun to surface across the East Coast of the U.S.

Britain's last surviving Dambuster has called for the public to support a Â£1million appeal to help maintain a memorial to the men of Bomber Command. Squadron Leader George 'Johnny' Johnson, 91, is backing the RAF Benevolent Fund's Upkeep Club, which is asking 1,000 people to donate Â£1,000 towards the memorial as it prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the Dambusters raid this Thursday. The club is named after the nickname given to the bouncing bombs that were dropped over Germany in the raid, designed by Sir Barnes Wallis. Squadron Leader George 'Johnny' Johnson, the last surviving British Dambuster, has called for the public to help with the upkeep of the Bomber Command memorial . The Bomber Command Memorial was unveiled by the Queen in London's Green Park last June . 'As a surviving veteran of 617 Squadron Dambusters raid, it is very gratifying to note the interest and respect afforded to the 70th anniversary of that operation,' he told the Daily Express. 'It is even more pleasing to know that, despite such a long wait, there is now a national and very fitting memorial to those comrades lost on the raid.' 'I extend my support and best wishes to the current efforts to raise the balance needed.' The Â£7.5million bronze memorial in London's Green Park was unveiled by the Queen last June in tribute to the 55,573 men who died while serving in Bomber Command during the Second World War. Almost half of the unit's 125,000 men did not come home while 8,400 were wounded and 10,000 taken prisoner. Sqn Ldr Johnson backed the Upkeep Club appeal, which aims to raise Â£1million for maintenance at the memorial . Among the 113 Dambusters who flew 19 aircraft over Germany, 53 airmen were killed and three became prisoners of war. The memorial's unveiling came after years of campaigning for Bomber Command to be properly recognised by Britain for their contribution to the battle against Nazi Germany, including the Operation Chastise bombing of the MÃ¶hne, Eder and Sorpe dams on May 16 and 17 1943. Bee Gee singer Robin Gibb and 1970s pop star Jim Dooley were among the celebrities who led the fundraising efforts, with substantial donations from Lord Ashcroft, entrepreneur John Caudwell and businessman Richard Desmond. Mr Gibb died from liver and kidney failure a month before the unveiling. Mr Dooley, told the Express: 'We are looking for 1,000 people to contribute Â£1,000 each. They can be individuals, companies or a group of supporters. 'They will get a badge, a tie and be invited to an annual celebration at the memorial. 'Their names will also be printed beside a photo of a Lancaster to be displayed in the RAF Club in London and RAF Museum in Hendon.' Johnny Johnson served as a bomb aimer in pilot Joe McCarthy's crew, part of the squadron which was based at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire. Today, he told the Mirror . that he never doubted that he and his six crew mates would return home . safely from the raid. He . said: 'The memories are still vivid and itâs Â­something that will always . be with me. Iâve never talked about that night without being asked. I . wasnât sure people would be interested. 'Iâm . asked how it feels to be the last British Dambuster. Well, excuse the . language, I feel bloody lucky. I was in the right crew, in the right . place at the right time and I feel honoured and privileged to have been . able to take part. 'But surviving when so many didnât come back was pretty shattering. There was an awful lot of loss â on both sides.'

The widower, who lives in Bristol, is the last living Briton among the airmen, who were made up of volunteers and experienced personnel from Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. He retired from the Royal Air Force in 1962 and became a junior school teacher. He and his late wife Gwyn have three children, eight grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren from their 62-year marriage. Gwyn, who served as a WRAF radio operator, died in 2005. Sergeant Fred Sutherland, from Canada, and Flight Lieutenant Les Munro from New Zealand, are the only other living Dambusters. The squadron was assembled by Wing Commander Guy Gibson with only 11 weeks to prepare for their mission. They were not told that they would be bombing the Ruhr Valley until six hours before the raid began, following weeks of practice over Peak District reservoirs. Sqn Ldr Johnson, seen with a picture of a Lancaster Bomber, plans to return to RAF Scampton this Thursday for events to mark the 70th anniversary of the raid . 617 Squadron, the team assembled by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, had only 11 weeks to prepare for their mission . On the night of May 16, the 19 Lancasters carrying 113 crewmen took off in three waves along two different routes to bomb the dams. Gibson attacked first at the MÃ¶hne at 12.28am, but five bombs were dropped before it was breached. The . first waveâs three remaining aircraft with bombs then attacked the Eder . which finally collapsed at 1.52am. Aircraft from the other two waves . bombed the Sorpe but it remained intact. Sqn . Ldr Johnson's crew had a lucky escape from anti-aircraft gunfire below. They shot at a train - and got a blast from a goods train's armament in . return. Lancaster Bombers carried 9,000lb of bouncing bombs for the Operation Chastise raids on Germany's Ruhr Valley dams . The shot pierced a tyre and blasted through the wing and undercarriage before embedding in the roof above the navigator's head. It narrowly missed the petrol tanks. The heroics of that night were immortalised in the 1955 film The Dambusters, starring Richard Todd and Michael Redgrave as Bomber Command head Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris and Barnes Wallis respectively. This Thursday, Sqn Ldr Johnson will return to RAF Scampton for anniversary celebrations and a sunset ceremony, to be shown on BBC2. To donate to the RAF Benevolent Fund's Upkeep Club, click here .
