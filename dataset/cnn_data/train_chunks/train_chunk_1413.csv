"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took a swipe at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Monday night, boasting that he 'didn't inherit fame or fortune from my family.' The two Republican politicians have emerged as early frontrunners for their party's 2016 presidential nomination. And though Walker promised just three days ago that he wouldn't launch attacks against other primary candidates, that pledge seems to have gone quickly out the window. 'I realize that unlike some out there, I didn't inherit fame or fortune from my family,' Walker told a convention of Christian broadcasters in Nashville, Tennessee. 'I got a bunch of things that were a whole lot better than that.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . JAB: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took a shot at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Monday night, saying he didn't 'inherit' fame and fortune from a family legacy . PLEDGE: Walker promised just three days ago at a National Governors Association meeting that he wouldn't attack fellow Republican presidential hopefuls . Spokespersons for Walker didn't immediately respond to questions about whether that line was meant as a brushback pitch at Bush, but his opponent with the marquee political name si the only one in the likely GOP presidential field who fits the bill. On Saturday, Walker told reporters at a Washington, D.C. meeting of the National Governors Association that he wouldn't go negative against fellow Republicans during what will likely be a fierce primary season. 'If I (am) a candidate, I’m not going to go out and attack my opponents,' he said, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. 'You're not going to hear me say ill will about any of the other candidates,' he said. But on Monday he drew stark lines of comparison between his hardscrabble origins and Bush's privileged upbringing. 'My grandparents on my mother's side raised my mother on a farm where they didn't have indoor plumbing until she went off to high school,' he said. 'And on my other side of the family, my grandfather was a machinist ... for about four decades,' 'I got from my parents and my grandparents the belief that if you work hard, if you played by the rules, here in America you can do anything you want,' said to applause. 'That's a pretty powerful belief. And I think we need to remind more of our young people today that we need to have that in America, right?' Video of his remarks surfaced Tuesday morning courtesy of American Bridge 21st Century, a far-left political action committee that supports likely Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. Bush's famous family, and its thorny political legacy, remains the biggest obstacle in his path to the Whtie House. 'Jeb Bush is asking us to do the impossible,' Bloomberg columnist Margaret Carlson wrote Tuesday: 'forget that he’s the son of one president and the brother of another.'","Wisconsin governor has vaulted to co-frontrunner status .

"A new material based on the skin of cuttlefish that makes objects and clothing invisible under infrared light could revolutionise modern warfare. Scientists have developed a transparent adhesive tape that can change how it reflects infrared light simply by stretching the material. When the cuttlefish-inspired tape is activated, it makes objects match the appearance of their surroundings - at least when viewed through infrared or thermal cameras. Cuttlefish have shape-shifting molecules in their skin that enables them to blend into their background . The tape, which is totally clear under visible light, could be used to create new types of camouflage clothing for soldiers to help them hide from weapons that use infrared imaging sights. We have all thought about how wonderful it would be to throw on a cloak that can hide us from the intrusive eyes of others. Ever since Professor John Pendry, a physicist at Imperial College London and his colleagues first outlined their theory in 2006 that it may be possible to hide objects using metamaterials, there has been a flurry of research in the area. Researchers in the US were able to cloak a three dimensional object for the first time from microwaves in 2012. However the object remained visible to the human eye. Others have managed to create similar cloaks that scatter radio waves and also from sound waves. However, so far the only way it has been possible to hide an object from the human eye has been to use lenses that bend the light around it. Professor Pendry has also used calcite crystals to send polarised light in different direction, directing it around small objects like paperclips. It could render many of the thermal sights and infrared imaging equipment used by modern military weapons ineffective. Researchers say the technology could also be used to produce clothing and coats that can keep people cool on warm days while retaining heat when the weather is cold. The technology is based upon a protein found in the skin of cephalopods like cuttlefish, octopus and squid. These sea creatures can change the way their skin reflects light by altering the pigment it contains, allowing them to blend in with their background. Dr Alon Gorodetsky, a materials chemist at the University of California, Irvine, and his colleagues say their the material they have produced is transparent and so can be used with traditional military camouflage. It would mean that soldiers would be able to slip past surveillance using thermal technology without being seen. Speaking to Mail Online, Dr Gorodetsky said: 'Camouflage is the target application for the stickers. 'To change the infrared reflectance of our materials, we take sticky adhesive tape coated with the protein and stretch it. 'This causes the reflectance of the coated to tape to shift from the infrared to the visible. The application of gentle heating can reverse the effect.' 'We are working on making analogous stickers with reflectance that could be tuned in the thermal infrared. 'If we achieve this, you could integrate the analogous stickers into clothing for electively trapping or releasing body heat.' While the new material might not yet allow people to enjoy invisibilty like Harry Potter (above) in visible light, it could help soldiers hide from infrared and thermal cameras by allowing them to blend into the background . Cuttlefish and other cephalopods are well known for their ability to blend into their surroundings by changing colour and shape. They can mimic everything from seaweed, rocks to other sea creatures animals. Their skin contains cells known as iridophores that reflect and refract light as it hits them. The membranes of these cells incorporate plate-like structures that contain the protein reflectin. When this protein is altered in a process called phosphorylation, it changes the size and structure of these tiny plates and in turn changes how the cells reflect light. Dr Gorodetsky and his team were able to replicate this by placing a thin layer of graphine oxide on top of a clear sticky tape. The new coating can be placed on tape to give it the same reflectivity as background vegetation, as shown in the images above. Image A shows untreated and treated tape under normal lighting conditions while image B shows how they appear under infrared light. The treated tape looks the same as the plant leaf on the right . The reflectivity can be changed by stretching or heating the material and can then return to its normal state afterwards. Writing in the Journal of Materials Chemistry C, Dr Gorodetsky said: 'We draw inspiration from the structures and proteins found in cephalopod skin to fabricate biomimetic camouflage coatings on transparent and flexible adhesive substrates. 'The substrates can be deployed on arbitrary surfaces, and we can reversibly modulate their reflectance from the visible to the near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum with a mechanical stimulus. 'These stickers make it possible to disguise common objects with varied roughnesses and geometries from infrared visualization. 'Our findings represent a key step towards the development of wearable biomimetic color- and shape-shifting technologies for stealth applications.' The way the new material reflects infrared light can be changed by stretching, as shown in the graphic above . Many pieces of advanced weaponry now use thermal sights to detect and designate targets - including the Apache helicopter and modern tanks. Civilian clothing featuring such technology, however, could make it harder for police helicopters, which also use thermal imaging, to track suspects. But Dr Gorodetsky said that similar technology could also be used to produce new types of clothing that can keep the wearer warm and cold as needed. Speaking to Chemistry World, Dr Gorodetsky said: ‘We hope to eventually develop autonomous clothing-integrated devices that will regulate how a person radiatively exchanges heat with their environment. ‘Wouldn’t it be neat if you had a jacket which could adapt to keep you cool on warm days and warm on cold days?’","Scientists at the University of California mimicked cuttlefish camouflage .

"Eight people have been shot dead and others injured after a 'mentally unstable' gunman stormed a Czech restaurant before taking his own life. The gunman, who is said to have been around 60 years old, went into the restaurant and started shooting indiscriminately before reportedly turning the gun on himself. A police spokesman confirmed the shooting in the town of Uhersky Brod, which is 180 miles south east of Prague, but declined to comment on any of the victims. Tonight, grieving locals were leaving candles in tribute to the victims of the attack as they struggled to deal with the shock of the shootings. Scroll down for video . Attack: Police secure the restaurant in the eastern Czech town of Uhersky Brod, where eight people have been shot dead . Scene: The restaurant where the shooting happened in the small town. The mayor of the town confirmed that the shooter was a local man aged around 60 . Shock: Grieving locals left candles at the scene of the shooting. Mayor Patrik Kuncar said: 'Nobody believed anything like that could happen in such a small town' Secure: Police tonight had cordoned off a house in the town, believed to be the home of the gunman . Also tonight, police had cordoned off a house in the town, believed to be the home of the gunman. One man - named in reports as Petr Gabriel - told how he was in the restaurant's bathroom when the shooting began. He said that saved his life and he told Czech public television that he then stayed hidden for two hours until he was found by police. Patrik Kuncar, the mayor of the small town, said that the shooter was a local man  and that he was carrying two weapons, including a shotgun. He added: 'I have been conveyed information that it was a 60-year-old local man, probably mentally unstable. 'I assume this was an isolated incident. I cannot see security measures that would prevent incidents like this. 'We have various anti-terrorist measures but we can see that, here, probably a lone shooter struck with no warning. 'Nobody believed anything like that could happen in such a small town. I can hardly imagine what consequences it will have for the future life in this town.' A waitress in the restaurant was shot in the chest and had hour-long surgery, said Dana Lipovska, spokesman for the hospital in the nearby town of Uherske Hradiste. Her condition tonight remained 'very serious,' Lipovska said. The owner of the restaurant, Pavel Karlik, said the attacker had walked in and started firing a handgun indiscriminately. Urgent: A rescue helicopter stands at the side of the road close to the restaurant ready to take any shooting victims to hospital . He added: 'I immediately ran out through the back door, along with other guests who then called an ambulance and police.' The country's Interior Minister Milan Chovanec, tonight visited the scene and said: 'It was not a terrorist attack'. The gunman was armed with two pistols and opened fire at the approaching police officers, Chovanec said. The attack shocked the town of 17,000, which is home to the Ceska Zbrojovka gun plant. The victims have been identified and were all from the region, Chovanec said. Drama: A police officer put cordon tape in place next to the restaurant where eight people were killed around noon when enjoying lunch . Officials: Mayor of Uherksy Brod, Patrik Kuncar, was quickly on the scene and said that the shooter was a local man and that he was carrying two weapons, including a shotgun . According to Czech television, the gunman stormed into the Druzhba restaurant and started shooting randomly, firing off 25 rounds around noon. One witness added that around 20 people were in the restaurant at the time of the shooting enjoying lunch. Other reports say the gunman called a Czech TV station shortly before the attack and spoke of his plans to open fire. It is thought that he told a journalist that he had been 'hurt' by people and the police had not helped him. Guard: Police officers stand guard near to where a gunman opened fire. They closed roads in the area surrounding the scene . Panic: Police cordoned off roads as witnesses say that around 20 people were in the restaurant at the time of the shooting . The shooter reportedly said: 'They're bullying me. I'm going to take care of this myself' as well as saying he was going to 'take things into his hands.' Emergency services were quickly on the scene and the restaurant was then cordoned off by officers wearing bullet proof vests. The Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, who is currently visiting South Korea, released a statement saying he had been made aware of the shooting and expressed his condolences to those affected. Stunned: A police officer directs traffic away from the restaurant where the shooter opened fire killing eight people . Meanwhile Thorbjorn Jagland, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, tweeted: 'Horrified at reports of #UherskyBrod shooting. An act of unspeakable violence. Our thoughts are with the victims, families and Czech people.' The Czech Republic has strict gun control laws but hunting is popular in the eastern European nation. The country became an independent nation in 1993 after the split of Czechoslovakia.","Gunman on rampage killed eight in small town of Uhersky Brod .

"A possessive boyfriend was jailed for life yesterday for murdering a mother-of-two who he met on dating website PlentyOfFish. Darren Jeffreys, 47, repeatedly punched 45-year-old Karen Catherall in the head and strangled her in an alcohol-fuelled attack at her home in Gwernaffield near Mold, Flintshire. The killer only called paramedics the following morning, and claimed he thought Ms Catherall was sleeping. Scroll down for video . Darren Jeffreys, 47, (left) was jailed for life  for murdering  mother-of-two Karen Catherall, 45, (right) who he met on dating website PlentyOfFish . Jeffreys, of Mold, who later admitted killing Ms Catherall, was yesterday told by a judge at the town's Crown Court that he would serve a minimum of 17 and a half years behind bars for her murder. The court was told that Jeffreys and Ms Catherall had met on free online dating website PlentyOfFish, and had been seeing each other for several weeks at the time of the attack on September 13, last year. The website boasts of being the largest site of its kind in the world, and has 88 million users. The couple were described as being fond of one another, and were becoming increasingly close, the court heard. On the morning of Ms Catherall's death, she and a friend had eaten breakfast at a  Wetherspoons pub, where she was drinking cider, the court heard. Jeffreys (left) is seen being taken into court for an earlier hearing, while Karen Catherall's mother Glenys Kier and her partner Esmor Evans are pictured leaving Mold Crown Court after yesterday's sentencing . She had told her the other woman that Jeffreys was a 'very nice guy but possessive', Owen Edwards, prosecuting,  told the court. Mr Edwards said Ms Catherall had later met up with Jeffreys, and the couple were seen drinking in Mold. She returned home at around 7pm, with Jeffreys following her shortly afterwards - when he launched the savage attack. It was not until the early hours of the following morning, at 2.35am, that Jeffeys called emergency services, claiming that he thought she was sleeping off the alcohol and he was unable to wake her. But paramedics who arrived at the house found she had been dead for some time. There was also evidence he had tried to cover up the killing, the court was told. A post mortem examination revealed that her cause of death had been blunt force trauma to the head and mechanical asphyxiation. Jeffreys had denied killing his girlfriend when interviewed by police, but in December last year admitted the murder. Members of Ms Catherall's family give a statement outside court yesterday. Mr Justice Wyn Williams had said that Jeffreys subjected his victim 'to a ferocious, sustained and in the end deadly attack' in her own home . The court heard that Jeffreys had a previous conviction for assaulting one of his previous partners. Andrew O'Byrne QC, mitigating, told the court that Jeffreys had acknowledged the obvious pain and loss of the victim's family. 'They will continue to suffer for some time to come although we hope in the fullness of time those feelings will abate but we recognise that they were never, ever fully go away,' he said, adding that the killing had not been pre-meditated. Sentencing, Mr Justice Wyn Williams, said Jeffreys had subjected Ms Catherall 'to a ferocious, sustained and in the end deadly attack' in her own home. He caused her 'very substantial internal and external injuries', particularly to her head and face, most probably caused by numerous, very hard, punches. 'The prosecution say that you literally battered her to death,' said the judge. 'In my judgment that is an appropriate description for what happened that night.' Mr Justice Williams told the court that Jeffreys had committed a terrible crime, depriving Ms Catherall of her life, and her family of a loved one. 'This was senseless violence on your part, most probably fuelled by alcohol and your possessive and jealous nature,' he told the defendant. The judge added that it had been several hours before Jeffreys called the emergency services, but added that any attempts to remove evidence of the killing was not an aggravating feature of the case. The judge also said that Jeffreys knew the victim was the worse for drink, and therefore vulnerable, and he took the view Jeffreys had intended to kill Ms Catherall that night. 'The nature and ferocity of the attack was quite appalling,' he added. Seven charges of assaulting four ex-partners, which Jeffreys had denied, were allowed to remain on the file. Speaking after the hearing, a spokesman for Ms Catherall's said: 'We welcome the life sentence that has been given. 'However, Darren Jeffreys will never truly pay for taking the innocent life of Karen in such a horrific and violent way. 'We hope he is haunted by his actions for the rest of his life. 'He took away a mother from her two sons and all our lives have been affected by his selfish and evil actions. 'It has been an unbearable and heart breaking time for everyone who knew and loved Karen. 'Karen enjoyed life to the full and will be sorely missed - may she now rest in peace. 'We would like to thank North Wales Police, the CPS and everyone involved for their support over the last five months.' DI Mark Hughes, of North Wales Police (NWP), added: 'Darren Jeffreys has been sentenced to serve a minimum of 17-and-a-half years in prison for the brutal murder of Karen Catherall. 'On behalf of NWP I would like to take this opportunity to extend our deepest sympathy to the family of Karen. 'I can only imagine what they have been through and I hope this now gives them closure and allows them to move forward. 'NWP together with our partners provide support to victims of domestic violence and I would encourage victims to come forward. 'The conviction demonstrates our commitment to dealing with incidents of domestic violence and bringing those responsible to justice. 'As a result North Wales will be a safer place.'","Darren Jeffreys, 47, admitted killing Karen Catherall, 45, at her home .

"The head of Families SA has said social workers missed opportunities to save a young girl who died from serious head injuries after being forced to ride a motorbike by her parents. Department for Education and Child Development chief executive Tony Harrison said Chloe Valentine's case workers had placed too much weight on preserving family unity at the expense of ensuring the girl's safety, in the years leading to her death. 'There was a very, very strong emphasis to, at all costs, keep the family together,' he told the inquest into Chloe's death on Tuesday. 'With the benefit of hindsight, we would have to wonder whether we persisted with that approach for too long. At an inquest into her death on Tuesday authorities said social workers missed the chance to save Chloe Valentine, 4, who died of massive head injuries in 2012 . The young girl was forced to ride a motorbike for days on end by her drug addicted mother and her partner . 'We have to be prepared, at the right time as we determine it, to take a strong intervention because that's needed to keep children alive.' The inquest has heard Chloe was forced to endure chronic neglect at the hands of her drug-using teenage mother but was never removed by Families SA. Chloe was four when she died of massive head injuries after being forced to ride a motorbike that repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in the backyard of her Adelaide home in January 2012. Her mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne, and Polkinghorne's then-partner are in jail after pleading guilty to Chloe's manslaughter through criminal neglect. The inquest has heard Chloe was forced to endure chronic neglect at the hands of her drug-using teenage mother Ashlee Polkinghorne (pictured) but was never removed by Families SA . A comprehensive review of Chloe's case had made clear that a 'circuit-breaker' was needed to save the girl from the chaos in her life . Mr Harrison, a former SA Police assistant commissioner who became head of the DECD in July 2013, said he strongly supported keeping families together and building the capability of parents within the child protection system. But a comprehensive review of Chloe's case had made clear that a 'circuit-breaker' was needed to save the girl from the chaos in her life. 'The question should have been asked as early as 2008 as to whether the removal of Chloe was appropriate,' he said. 'It seemed like we missed opportunities to consider the option of removing the child from the environment.' Families SA received 20 child abuse notifications during Chloe's short life from witnesses concerned about the girl's filthy, transient and unsafe living conditions . Families SA received 20 child abuse notifications during Chloe's short life from witnesses concerned about the girl's filthy, transient and unsafe living conditions, her mother's drug use and her exposure to domestic violence in the family home. State Coroner Mark Johns has questioned why Polkinghorne was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers, who helped clean her house and avoided confronting her about her drug use. Mr Harrison admitted there was potential for social workers to be compromised by their intimate involvement in a case. 'There can be some blurring of objectivity as social workers build relationships with families,' he said. The inquest continues.

"A jab of gel may be a new way to treat heart failure, a condition that affects 900,000 people in Britain. The substance is injected into the heart wall to improve the organ’s function and reduce symptoms such as breathlessness and swelling in the ankles. Heart failure is a sign the heart has been damaged — this can occur for a number of reasons, including cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and heart attack. Heart failure is a sign the heart has been damaged — this can occur for a number of reasons, including cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and heart attack . As a result, the heart is no longer able to pump blood around the body properly. To try to increase its pumping power, the heart grows in size. This works for a while, but eventually the over-worked heart wall starts to stretch, becoming thinner and stiffer. The heart develops an abnormal shape and ends up pumping blood even less efficiently. The condition can also affect the heart’s normal electrical signals, which can result in a dangerous heart rhythm disorder. There’s no cure for heart failure, but lifestyle changes — such as cutting down on salt — and medication to reduce blood pressure can help keep symptoms under control. However, some patients do not respond to these. The hope is that the new gel injections will offer them an effective alternative. The treatment, called Algisyl-LVR, involves having 12 to 18 jabs administered directly into the heart’s main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, where the disease tends to start. The jabs are given by a surgeon through an incision in the chest. The injections contain a gel-like material that thickens in the heart muscle, strengthening it and restoring its shape. This increases the heart’s pumping efficiency and reduces stress on the organ, preventing further damage. The treatment, called Algisyl-LVR, involves having 12 to 18 jabs administered directly into the heart’s main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, where the disease tends to start . The gel doesn’t harden completely, remaining pliant so it is flexible enough to move with the tissue of the heart wall. It is being trialled on 80 patients in 14 centres worldwide, including in Italy, Germany, Romania, Australia and the Netherlands. Early results show the jabs improve the heart’s capacity and reduce symptoms. The U.S. manufacturer Lone-Star Heart says: ‘It represents a new treatment strategy based on the medically accepted principle that a reduction in muscle tension and cell stress will improve the function of the dilated left ventricle of the heart.’ Dr Christopher Morley, consultant cardiologist at Bradford teaching hospitals NHS Trust, says: ‘This ingenious technique of injecting a gel directly to the left ventricular muscle has a sound physiological basis. ‘Hopefully, it will prove to be effective and safe in patients who otherwise may have a poor prognosis.’","The treatment involves having 12 to 18 jabs administered directly into heart .

"He may be facing up to 20 years behind bars for going on a week-long crime-spree across six states with his underage girlfriend - but Dalton Hayes says he'd do it all again for the girl. A month after Hayes and his 13-year-old girlfriend, who were dubbed 'teen Bonnie and Clyde', were arrested in Florida, he has spoken out in an exclusive jailhouse interview with Dr Phil, revealing that he still loves her and cries in jail because he misses her so much. And even though the 18-year-old, from Leitchfield, Kentucky, faces multiple charges including second-degree rape, the trip was worth it to make her happy, he said. 'The look in her eyes at the beach, the way she looked at me... she was the most happy girl alive,' he said in the interview, which will air on Wednesday. 'I would do it all over again to protect her.' Scroll down for videos . 'Protective': Dalton Hayes, 18, has claimed that he fled Kentucky with his underage girlfriend in January because he wanted to protect her. They were found two weeks later in Florida and he remains in jail . Tough questions: Hayes spoke in an exclusive interview from his Kentucky jailhouse with Dr Phil . The girl, whom MailOnline is not naming because she is a minor, had urged Hayes to flee the state with her on January 3, claiming that she was being beaten by her family, he told Dr Phil. He saw the bruises to back up her story, he said, and they set their sights on Panama. (The girl's father has strongly denied hurting her.) But unfortunately for Hayes, he was supposed to be in court the following day on robbery charges - and his girlfriend, who had always told him she was 18, actually turned out to be 13. Even though he knows the truth now, he still loves her, he said. 'There's not a day that don't go by where I don't think about her,' he told Dr Phil. 'Two days ago I called my mom and I cried to my mom because I miss her. Some people think it's a bad thing because she's 13. I had no clue she was 13.' Despite finding out her real age on the day they fled, he said that she was so terrified of returning home that he knew he had to do something. On the run: Hayes, pictured with his girlfriend, said she had told him she was 18 - but she was actually 13. He found out the truth on the day they fled, but he decided to stay with her and protect her anyway . Emotional: Hayes wiped away tears as he spoke about his love for the girl and for his parents . 'I didn't have much of a plan,' Hayes said. 'The only thing I knew to do was to protect her and keep her safe and that's what I did... My first instinct is ""forget about court, I'm gonna keep her safe"".' They fled and eluded authorities for more than a week, allegedly stealing three trucks - including one with two guns inside - on their drive across Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. In South Carolina, they were reportedly seen driving one of the stolen trucks before heading inside a Walmart where they allegedly cashed a stolen check. While they were on the road, he never forced her to stay away from home and made sure she was well cared for, he said. 'I had not one dollar. She did not go hungry, I always fed her,' he said. 'I would let her eat before I'd even take a bite of anything.' He repeatedly told her he wanted to go home, he said, but she said no. Care-free: The couple were spotted on CCTV in a Walmart in Manning, South Carolina after fleeing Kentucky . Caught on camera: They were allegedly seen driving this stolen truck outside the Walmart . 'I knew we was going to get caught,' he told Dr Phil. 'I knew what I was facing. After she had told me her real age, I knew what I would come home to. 'But she thought it was all a joke. She would laugh about things. She would think every thing's funny. And it just so happens when we were arrested, not every thing's funny.' When a passerby spotted them sleeping inside a truck in an IHOP parking lot in Panama City, Florida and recognized the duo from news reports, they were arrested - to Hayes' relief. The young couple quickly said their goodbyes as police handcuffed them. 'She said, ""Go somewhere"",' he recalled. 'There was nowhere to go. So they put us both on the ground. And I told her – I said, ""I love you."" And she said, ""I love you, too."" And that was it.' Now, he thinks about her every day, but although he admitted he made poor choices, he doesn't regret what they did because it saved her from her family, he said. Captured: Hayes can be seen as he is taken into custody in a Panama City, Florida parking lot in January . He also said that they had been engaged and, at one point she had been pregnant - which his mother disputed - but that now he has no plans to marry her. Still, he misses her. Jailed: He faces multiple charges, including second-degree rape after his relationship with the girl . 'If I had a chance to see her and look at her, I'd tell her that I love her, tell her that her eyes still shine brighter than the stars do - just tell her everything's going to be alright,' he said. 'I want people out there to know that I did not do it to hurt her, I did it to keep her safe. Not only then did I love her but today I still love her.' Even though Hayes does not dispute all the charges, one thing he took umbrage with was being dubbed 'Bonnie and Clyde'. 'I wasn't nothing like that,' he said. 'We did not hurt nobody. We did not have no intentions of hurting anybody.' He knows he faces between 10 and 20 years behind bars but says he is looking forward to the opportunity to turn his life around. He plans to get his GED and start college, he said. But he became emotional as he spoke about his parents, calling himself a 'momma's boy'. His father has also been diagnosed with throat cancer and Hayes fears he will not see him again, he said. 'I really am scared my dad's not going to make it,' he said. 'That's what hurts the most.' He also expressed remorse for the damage he had done on the crime spree, and apologized to a couple whose truck he damaged. A grand jury indicted Hayes on a dozen charges three weeks ago. Remorse: He said he now fears he may not see his father, pictured together left, again because the man has been diagnosed with throat cancer. He also said he had let down his mother, who had always cared for him . Among the charges, he faces up to 10 years in prison for second-degree rape, with no force. In Kentucky, a second-degree rape occurs when an adult has sex with a minor under 14, even if it's consensual. The grand jury also indicted Hayes on two thefts that occurred in early December. He also faces custodial interference, criminal trespassing and criminal mischief charges. Police say the 13-year-old girl will face charges in juvenile court. The full Dr Phil interview will air on Wednesday.

"Interest rates could be cut even further from their already record low of just 0.5 per cent, the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney revealed this morning. The Bank chief said the banking system could cope with interest rates being cut closer to zero – but refused to say how far they could fall. However, Mr Carney insisted it was still more likely that rates would go up after inflation returns to normal after a period of falling prices this year. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said interest could be cut below 0.5 per cent - but it was still more likely that they would rise . Mr Carney this morning insisted the current low inflation was temporary and will return to its 2 per cent target within two years. ‘What's important is that workers and businesses understand this is a temporary phenomena,’ he told MPs. The Bank chief added: ‘Enjoy it while it lasts because petrol prices are not going to continue to fall. Food prices are not going to continue to fall.’ Mr Carney said that three-quarters of the current weakness in inflation was due to falling prices of oil and food, which he said was a ‘temporary, one-off development’. He stressed that if there was any evidence of a sustained fall in inflation, the Bank could ‘if necessary’ cut interest rates from their current 0.5 per cent low to zero, but he emphasised that the ‘focus of policy is towards tightening’. He said: ‘Because of the resilience of banking and building societies has increased, we are in a position where we could, if necessary, cut bank rates towards zero. That is – to a level that is still above zero – but we haven’t specified a specific level.’ Mr Carney this morning insisted the current low inflation was temporary and will return to its 2 per cent target within two years. Today's 0.5 per cent interest rates are already an historic low after soaring to 17 per cent in the 1980s . But he said: ‘We are not having an active discussion about it, because the focus of policy has been towards the timing and degree of tightening where appropriate.’ Mr Carney added: ‘The bank rate is more likely than not to be higher than it is at present at the end of the forecast period.’ The Bank's base rate has been at a record low of 0.5 per cent for nearly six years. Markets are currently expecting an interest rate rise in early 2016. However, in written evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, Martin Weale, one of two members of the MPC to have voted to raise interest rates late last year, said it ‘may be appropriate to raise Bank Rate rather earlier than financial markets currently anticipate’. His warning chimed with an earlier speech by MPC member Kristin Forbes, who said there were risks to the economy if interest rates remained at their record low rate for too long. She said a rate hike might be needed ‘in the near future’.","Governor said banking system could cope with interest rates being cut .

"Ministers are examining proposals to create a new British Sikh regiment, reminiscent of the ones that fought in both world wars, it has emerged. Speaking yesterday in Parliament, former defence minister Sir Nicholas Soames urged the Government to ‘do away with political correctness’, praising ‘the extraordinary gallant and distinguished service by Sikhs to this country down the generations’. And Tory MP Rory Stewart, chairman of the defence select committee, asked Armed Forces minister Mark Francois to look at a Sikh company within the reserves ‘as a starting point’. Heritage: First World War Sikh soldiers. Supporters say soldiers should be given a regiment to take pride in . Mr Francois said he believes the plan – which was dropped by the Ministry of Defence in 2007 for fear of being branded racist – ‘may well have merit’. And the Tory frontbencher went on to reveal that the suggestion was being ‘looked at’, saying the proposed regiment would inherit many ‘proud traditions of Sikh regiments’ from the Army’s past. Mr Soames told him: ‘You will be aware of the extraordinary gallant and distinguished service by Sikhs to this country down the generations. ‘Would you not agree with me that it’s high time to do away with the political correctness which infects some of this thinking and actually raise a Sikh regiment to serve in the country and make up a very serious gap in our Armed Forces?’ In 2007 defence chiefs abandoned plans to create a regiment of British Sikhs after talks with the Commission for Racial Equality. Tradition: The Sikh guard, from 5th Battalion of the 14th Punjabi Regiment, pictured in Addis Ababa . Sikh leaders informed recruitment officers that they could easily find enough volunteers to form a 700-strong regiment. But Lieutenant General Sir Freddie Viggers – who was responsible for recruitment at the time – is understood to have accepted race commissioners’ argument that creating the regiment would amount to ‘segregation’. Leaders of Britain’s 500,000 Sikhs were supportive of the idea of a new regiment, arguing that it would be no different from the Scots, Welsh and Irish Guards or the Royal Gurkha Rifles, which recruits exclusively from Nepal and which is regarded as a model infantry regiment. Support: Former defence minister Sir Nicholas Soames backed the idea (file photo) The decision to shelve the plans was at the time criticised by politicians, members of the Sikh community and soldiers, who claimed that the Army had fallen victim to political correctness. Kuljit Singh Gulati, the general secretary of the Sikh Temple in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, said: ‘The Sikhs have a long and distinguished heritage of serving with the British Army. ‘I know there are many, many Sikhs who would join up and would serve wherever required. 'But if you want to get them in large numbers they need their own regiment, something they would take a huge amount of pride in. ‘They would regard it as very prestigious. It is a shame that it now looks as though it will never happen.’ Prince Charles has previously expressed an interest in the creation of dedicated units to boost the number of people from ethnic minorities in the services and to harness the military tradition of the Sikh faith in particular. The move comes after the Ministry of Defence  revealed plans to try and recruit more Muslims and ethnic minorities into the army after the rise of Islamic State and massacre in Paris. Troops have posted pamphlets on British military values through the doors of Islamic religious schools have been instructed to take part in integration projects in a bid to boost numbers.","Plan was dropped by MoD in 2007 due to concerns over 'segregation'

"A Second World War Royal Navy torpedo boat which sank two German destroyers is on the way to being restored to her former glory after spending half a century as a houseboat. Engineer Paul Childs has spent a year working on the 73ft boat, which is moored at Bridgwater Docks in Somerset and is said to be the only known example of her kind. The Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) 219 was built in Portsmouth in 1941 to defend Britain from the threat of a German invasion. She has now been floated as part of the next stage of her restoration. Scroll down for video . Now moored in Bridgwater: Engineer Paul Childs has spent a year working on the 73ft Motor Torpedo Boat . London life: The torpedo boat was previously used as a houseboat on the River Thames, based in Chelsea . Repairs: The renovation of the torpedo boat - which was built in 1941 - is seen getting underway in Bridgwater . Here she comes: The boat arriving in Bridgwater ahead of stage two of the renovation project by Mr Childs . The torpedo boat - from a fleet which protected home waters and famously earned the nickname ‘iron men in wooden boats’ - was used as a houseboat for 50 years in Chelsea, south-west London. Mr Childs said the project had cost him £30,000 so far and he needed to raise another £30,000 to finish it, adding that ‘stage one’ of the refurbishment at Tilbury Docks in Essex had been finished. Mr Childs said: ‘We towed it under Tower Bridge from Chelsea. This is stage two. Then we go to stage three and hopefully, when she’s finished, she’s going to join another vessel that we’ve got.’ The MTB 219 was involved in attempts to intercept the Scharnhorst, Gneisneau and Prinz Eugen, known as the Channel Dash, in 1942. She also rescued a number of aircrew from downed Fairey Swordfish bomber aircraft and helped sink two German destroyers.

MTB 219 and other Coastal Forces ships sunk German destroyer Seeadler (above) in the Dover Strait in 1942 . Hit: MTB 219 was also involved in the sinking of the Kreigsmarinewerft Iltis (pictured) in the same year, 1942 . Mr Childs said the vessel's hull was condemned in 2012 and her owner gifted the boat to Mr Childs in August 2013. He added: ‘We’re going to put a wreath on the front, which has been donated, just to commemorate the guys that actually died on this vessel whilst in service, and the hundreds that died elsewhere in the campaign.’ Mr Childs said stage two of the restoration in Bridgwater was likely to take a year, but the vessel could stay in the town for longer. During that time he hopes to host opens days and encourage volunteers to help out with painting and maintenance. In addition to MTB 219, there are believed to be two other surviving MTB boats - 102 and 331 - although these are both of different classes to 219, leaving this as the only one in her category. There were 577 Motor Torpedo Boats commissioned for the Royal Navy and 637 for the US Navy - totalling 1,214. Some 173 of these were lost during the Second World War. The MTBs - along with other boats in the Coastal Forces, a division of the Royal Navy - often operated close to enemy-occupied coasts, attacking ships in the English Channel and protecting our convoys around Britain's coasts.","Engineer Paul Childs has spent a year and £30,000 working on 73ft boat .

"If you have ever fancied a sapphire ring like Kate Middleton’s or a crown like the Queen’s, you could grow you own. Physicists have grown a replica of the Imperial State Crown and the Duchess of Cambridge’s engagement ring, in a simple experiment that can be tried at home. The experts grew their own jewels from a chemical compound found in common household items such as drain unblocker and antiseptic cream. Physicists have grown a replica of the Imperial State Crown (pictured) and the Duchess of Cambridge’s engagement ring (also shown), in a simple experiment that can be tried at home . The experiment took eight months and marks the Queen becoming the longest reigning monarch later this year. It is also intended to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers, and will go on show at the Big Bang UK Young Scientists & Engineers Fair next month. The experiment can be carried out by children in the classroom and shows the science behind acid-base reactions, which form the basis of nearly all biological processes in living things. The ‘crowning glory’ of the replica Imperial State Crown – an imitation of St Edward’s Sapphire - was made from a common cleaning powder, which was mixed with boiling water to create a copper sulphate crystal. Copper sulphate is a form of drain unblocker and is also used in antiseptic cream. The experts grew their own jewels (pictured) from  copper sulphate, which is found in common household items such as drain unblocker and antiseptic cream. The experiment’s intended to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers, along with the Big Bang UK Young Scientists & Engineers Fair . Ingredients: Copper sulphate powder, two glass jaws, filter paper, a wooden stick, thread, a spoon, goggles and gloves . In the Big Bang Fair experiment, the raw crystals were shaped to create facets, to make the crystals look more like the Crown Jewels. Scientists made the blue crystals by first adding copper sulphate powder to boiling water until the solution became saturated - when there is no more room between the water’s molecules and nothing else will dissolve – and the solution was bright blue. They then filtered the mixture to remove any specks of dust and other impurities that might have got in the solution and would create cloudy crystals. The scientists heated the filtered mixture so that the water changed state to a gas through evaporation. The copper sulphate could not evaporate so it stayed behind, creating a more concentrated copper sulphate solution. As more water evaporated, there was less space for the copper sulphate molecules within the solution, so in order to fit in, the molecules formed symmetrical patterns, resulting in crystals. The solution evaporated overnight and the scientists picked the most promising crystal ‘seeds’ from which to grow their replica Crown Jewels, by hanging them from threads dipped in fresh copper sulphate solution so they could keep growing. The Big Bang Fair’s jewels also contain thousands of laboratory-grown crystals, which are almost impossible to tell apart from diamonds, for example, with the naked eye. Synthetic gems have many important uses in everyday life such as in lasers, smartphone screens, and watch faces - boasting hardiness close to that of natural diamonds. Scientists made the blue crystals (pictured) by first adding copper sulphate powder to boiling water until the solution became saturated. Several processes later, the raw crustals were shaped by jewellers to make the professional looking 'stone' seen in in the replica engagement ring . By exposing basic chemicals to extremely high temperatures, scientists were able to create synthetic spinel, corundum and cubic zirconia crystals to mimic priceless gems including the Black Prince Ruby, Stuart Sapphire, and the Cullinan II, which is the fourth largest polished diamond in the world. Once grown, the crystals were cut to the exact specifications of the royal treasures before being carefully set into their casings by jewellers, to create the impressive replica crown. ‘Crystals are amazing - not only are they incredibly beautiful to look at, but they are also very useful,’ Prabhakaran Dharmalingam, head of the crystal growth unit at Oxford University said. ‘A lot of important discoveries, many that went on to win Nobel prizes, were only possible because of crystals. ‘I hope that this project will help get young people excited about science and inspired to take that excitement further with their studies and into their careers.’ The jewels will be on display at the fair at the NEC on Birmingham from March 11 to 14.

"Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are changing their approach in the battle to block President Barack Obama's unilateral changes to the immigration system. After Senate Democrats on Monday filibustered for the fourth time a bill that would defund the president's immigration measures while fully supporting the rest of the Homeland Security Department, Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said he would introduce new legislation targeting Obama's immigration 'overreach' that is not tied to appropriations for DHS. House Speaker John Boehner, through an aide, swiftly backed his Senate counterpart's move, creating an avenue for the GOP to end its standoff with the president - who on Tuesday again pressured congressional Republicans to take up immigration reform - and his party before a Friday evening deadline to fund DHS or allow it to temporarily shutdown. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday night he was changing his approach in the battle to block President Barack Obama's unilateral changes to the immigration system . Staredown: McConnell is now pursuing legislation that target's Obama's immigration 'overreach' but is not tied to appropriations for DHS as a deadline to prevent a temporary, partial, shutdown of the department inches closer. In an op-ed  Tuesday Obama again defended his directives and called on Congress to make permanent reforms to the nation's broken immigration system and argued that a Homeland Security shutdown would be bad for the country . Speaking on the Senate floor on Tuesday, McConnell encouraged Senate Democrats to vote for his bill to prevent the president's executive actions from being enforced. 'The bill isn’t tied to DHS funding. There’s no excuse for our friends on the other side to oppose it,' he said. McConnell asserted that the bill would take away Democrats' ability to hide 'behind all manner of excuses to avoid upsetting the Far Left' in the immigration debate and force them to say on record whether they support the president's 'extreme overreach.' The Senate's head lawmaker said it is still his preference that the upper chamber approve the House-passed legislation that funds all of the Homeland Security Department's activities except those mandated by Obama in November. 'But as long as Democrats continue to prevent us from even debating that bill, I’m ready to try another way,' he said. Following McConnell's announcement from the Senate floor on Monday night, a top aide to House Speaker Boehner indicated to reporters that his boss would back the altered strategy. 'This vote will highlight the irresponsible hypocrisy of any Senate Democrat who claims to oppose President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration, but refuses to vote to stop it,' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said in a statement. 'If we are going to work together on the American peoples priorities, Washington Democrats must be honest with the people they represent.' The move has some conservatives concerned that McConnell may be capitulating to Democrats. Conservatives wanted to tie funding for the entire federal government to legislation undercutting Obama's immigration directives, but settled in December to a bill that would only put the Homeland Security Department's monies in jeopardy based on a promise from leadership that it would fight 'tooth and nail' to stop the president. 'This was entirely predictable,' a GOP Senate aide told Daily Mail Online on Tuesday. 'We knew leader McConnell was going to have a big challenge.' 'While this strategy if pursued with commitment and vigilance could be a winning one, the fear is it may only be a crafty way to appear to be fighting while signaling a white flag,' the aide, who was not authorized to speak on the record on this matter and asked not to be named, said. Democrats have said for months that the debate over reforms to the immigration system should be separated from funding for the Homeland Security department. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid drove this point home in remarks from the Senate floor on Tuesday and at a press conference with his Democratic colleagues that afternoon. 'Democrats have said all along that we are more than happy to have an immigration debate here on the Senate floor, so long as we first fully fund the Department of Homeland Security,' Reid said. Reid said he does 'appreciate' McConnell's need to 'please the extreme voices on his side, then called on him to allow a vote on a 'clean' DHS funding bill. 'The fact remains that we are four days away from a Homeland Security shutdown,' he said. 'Funding expires on Friday, and yet last night the Majority Leader moved to bring a bill to the floor that does absolutely nothing to fund Homeland Security – nothing.' At the presser, Reid invoked America's enemies and noted that they'll still continue to operate while DHS is shutdown, if it comes to that. 'ISIS is funded, we see that every day on TV,' he said. Contending that the Senate has 'fiddled around here for four weeks,' he said instead of funding one of its most vital departments, Reid told reporters, 'It appears to me that the ideologues are still running the Republican Party.' Even if Republicans were to convince Democrats to get on board with their original course of action, a shutdown would still be on the table. The White House has already said it would veto legislation that attempts to interfere with the president's immigration directives, Republican attempts. On Monday, with just five days left until a shutdown, the Obama administration tried to raise the stakes for Republicans. The president argued that temporary shutdown would have a 'direct impact' on national security - a sentiment that was later echoed at a press conference by his Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. President Barack Obama on Monday, while speaking to a group of governors at the White House, claimed that a Homeland Security shutdown would have a 'direct impact' on national security in attempt to convince Republicans to change course . While the majority of DHS would remain up and running in the case of a shutdown - just 15 percent of the department's workers were sent home during a 16-day standoff between Republicans and Democrats in 2014 - the White House argued that some of the furloughed employees, while deemed non-essential for these purposes, were more important to DHS' operations that it would at first seem. The president's spokesman also told reporters that the Homeland Security Departments to engage in future planning would be negatively affected if workers were sent home. Roughly 30,0000 of DHS' employees would be kept out of the office, Politico estimates, in the case of a shutdown, while another 200,000 would be asked to stay on with delayed pay. President Obama again jumped into the fray on Tuesday morning with an op-ed in The Hill urging the GOP-led Congress to have a robust debate on permanent reforms to the nation's immigration process. Obama reiterated his previous claims that wouldn't have had to unilaterally take action if the legislative branch had passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill backed by his administration in the last  session of Congress. 'Our immigration system has been broken for decades,' he wrote on Tuesday. 'Our country deeply values fairness, but our immigration system has become unfair to businesses, workers and families alike. 'That’s something I’ve been trying to change as president.' Defending his mandates, which will protect 4 million illegal immigrants from deportation if or when they are implemented, the president said they 'are good for our economy, for our families and for our country.' 'But I also continue to believe that these steps are no substitute for congressional action,' he said. 'It’s time to end the era of manufactured crises, put politics aside and focus on doing what’s best for America. 'So while I will fight any attempt to turn back the progress we’ve made or break up families across our country, I welcome the opportunity to work with anyone who wants to build on the improvements we’ve put in place, and fix our broken immigration system once and for all.'","Senate Democrats on Monday filibustered a bill that would have defunded Obama's immigration measures while fully supporting Homeland Security .

"Millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money have been wasted by giving loans to bogus students from the EU, MPs warn today. Some £3.84million was handed out over the last four years to EU students at private higher education colleges who could not prove they were eligible for funding. Only those who have lived in the UK for three years can receive loans to cover living costs. If they have not been resident in the UK for the previous years but are EU citizens, they are only eligible for loans to cover their tuition fees. Loans: £3.84million was handed out over the last four years to EU students at private higher education colleges who could not prove they were eligible for funding, a cross-party report by MPs has found . And the total amount wasted is likely to be much higher, as the MPs said the Government was ‘unable to quantify’ how much money was given to students who then failed to attend or complete courses. Some 20 per cent of students receiving funding were not even registered for a qualification, according to the Public Accounts Committee’s report, published today. The number of privately funded colleges, or ‘alternative providers’, has grown rapidly, with 53,000 students claiming financial support in 2013/2014 compared with 7,000 in 2010/2011. The total public money paid to these students has increased from £50 million to £675 million in that period. Public Accounts committee chairman Margaret Hodge criticised the 'lax' approach . The committee said the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills drove this expansion ‘without sufficient regulation’ to protect public money. Committee chairman Margaret Hodge criticised the department’s ‘lax approach’ and said it was warned about the risks ‘but chose to disregard them’. She said: 'The Department pressed ahead with the expansion of the alternative provider sector without sufficient regulation in place to protect public money. 'The Department was explicitly warned by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFC) and the Universities and College Union about these risks but chose to disregard them both before and after implementation. 'As a result of its lax approach, the Department allowed £3.84 million of public money to be given to ineligible EU students in the form of student loans and grants, where EU students had either chosen not to or had been unable to prove that they met eligibility criteria on residency. 'Furthermore, it has been unable to quantify how much money has been lost when it has funded students who have failed to attend, or failed to complete courses, or were not proficient in the English language, or were not entered for qualifications, or where courses themselves were poorly taught.' She also accused ministers of failing legitimate students and colleges, and demanded an urgent review to discover the total amount wasted. In a report published by the committee today, the MPs examined financial support for students at 140 'alternative higher education providers', which are privately funded but take on those who have student loans. It found that the rapid expansion in numbers was concentrated in five colleges, which accounted for 50 per cent of the expansion. Around 20 per cent of students receiving funding were not registered for a qualification and drop-out rates were 'very high' in some institutions. The committee said that while the expansion was aimed at widening access to UK students, 40 per cent of the publicly funded students at the colleges were actually from the EU. This compared with 6 per cent in the rest of the higher education sector. Mrs Hodge noted: 'The Department's record in collecting loan repayments from EU students who have returned overseas is already poor. Studying: Legitimate students are failed by the findings, said the committee of MPs (file photo) 'There was also evidence from whistleblowers that proficiency in English language was not tested, that some institutions were recruiting students on the streets, and that students claiming funding were not attending colleges.' She accused ministers of failing to protect the interests of legitimate students and the reputations of those colleges that were performing well. She demanded an urgent review to discover the total amount wasted and said measures must be put in place to keep track of expenditure in the future. It comes after the National Audit Office found in December that thousands of students enrolled with new private higher education colleges were not registered to take recognised exams. It also warned that the dropout rate among students at nine of the alternative higher education providers was in excess of 20 per cent. That is five times the dropout rate seen in traditional universities, with which the new colleges were designed to compete. The expansion of such providers followed reforms introduced by the former higher education minister David Willetts. 'Shocked': UCU general secretary Sally Hunt . Yesterday, University and College Union (UCU) general secretary, Sally Hunt, said: 'Members of the Public Accounts Committee were as shocked as we were over the government's refusal to heed our warnings about private providers' access to taxpayers' money. The government still has serious questions to answer about why it ignored these repeated warnings and why it allowed such rapid expansion to go unchecked. 'Politicians of all stripes need to study today's report about the sector's failings when it comes to dealing with privatisation.' Professor Aldwyn Cooper, Vice Chancellor of Regent's University London and Chair of the Independent Universities Group, said: 'It is important to remember that there are many alternative providers offering a first rate higher education. 'The members of the Independent Universities Group (IUG) have undergone stringent quality reviews in order to gain their own degree awarding powers and provide excellent student outcomes. 'These institutions offer first rate value for money, employability and student experience. 'They receive no direct funding from government and are careful to ensure that they are fully compliant with the expectations of the Department and the Student Loans Company. 'Poor quality should not be tolerated. It drains the public purse and risks tarnishing the UK higher education brand.' A BIS spokesperson said: 'Alternative providers play a significant role in widening access to higher education for British and foreign students, as well as boosting our exports. 'Our priority is to protect the interest of students and safeguard taxpayer's money. We have made continuous improvements to the management of alternative providers since 2012. We recently introduced reforms to drive up quality, aimed at the small number of providers who are not currently meeting our high standards. 'These include a fit and proper persons test for directors and a requirement to register students for the course before they can access funding. We are also shortly consulting on how to ensure that all students on funded courses have the right English language skills to achieve their qualifications.'","Only students who have been in UK 3 years can claim for cost of living .
But many of those granted the loans showed no proof they were eligible .

"Bruce Jenner could be financially destroyed if the relatives of the 69-year-old woman who died in a four-car horror crash involving his SUV earlier this month decide to sue him, it has been claimed. The Olympic gold medalist only had insurance coverage up to $250,000 when he allegedly rear-ended Kim Howe's Lexus on a California highway, according to a source close to the investigation. This means he may be left in a precarious position if Ms Howe's family chooses to file a civil lawsuit against him. In such a case, 'the sky's the limit with what a jury could award,' one attorney said. However it has been claimed that Jenner, who stars in reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, is unlikely to face charges over the fatal crash. Jenner is still incredibly wealthy after divorcing from his wife, Kris, with whom he shared an estimated $125million fortune. Scroll down for video . Crash scene: Bruce Jenner could be financially destroyed if the relatives of the 69-year-old woman who died in a four-car horror crash involving his SUV earlier this month decide to sue him, it has been claimed. Above, the reality TV star is pictured at the scene of the fatal accident, which widow killed Kim Howe, on February 7 . But if he is hit by a civil lawsuit relating to the crash on February 7, he could face losing  millions of dollars - and may even experience financial ruin due to his 'low' insurance coverage, it is claimed. 'It’s absolutely crazy that someone who has his kind of money would risk everything by not having higher rates of protection,' the unnamed source close to the investigation told RadarOnline. Last week, California-based criminal defense attorney, R.J. Manuelian, said that criminal charges are unlikely to be filed against Jenner following the fatal crash on Malibu's Pacific Coast Highway. If they are, the 65-year-old will avoid prison and likely be granted probation, he told Fox 411. But he added: 'However, Jenner's biggest worry should be the wrongful death lawsuit, which will be filed soon enough, and will reach deep into his pockets if his insurance doesn't cover his tab.' Police sources told TMZ that because Jenner had not been drinking, texting or speeding when the crash happened he was unlikely to face charges. Speaking to People magazine, James Fox, an attorney who specializes in motor vehicle crashes, agreed that Jenner could suffer a huge financial blow if Ms Howe's relatives file a civil suit. Wreckage: The Olympic gold medalist only had insurance coverage up to $250,000 when he allegedly rear-ended Kim Howe's Lexus (pictured after the crash) on a California highway, according to a close source . Victim: This means he may be left in a precarious position if Ms Howe's (pictured) family chooses to file a civil lawsuit against him. In such a case, 'the sky's the limit with what a jury could award,' one attorney said . If he were found liable, 'the sky's the limit with what a jury could award,' said Mr Fox, adding that the state's 'comparative fault' law means that fault can be apportioned among many parties by a court. It comes as it has been reported that data from the Sensing Diagnostic Module in Jenner's car showed he was driving between 46 and 47mph when he slammed on the brakes, according to TMZ. The impact happened soon after, when the vehicle was travelling at 38mph, a source reportedly told the website. A police source has claimed that surveillance footage taken by cameras on a nearby MTA bus and shows that Jenner started the chain-reaction crash that killed Ms Howe. Jenner was hauling an off-road vehicle on a trailer behind his Cadillac Escalade when he steered to avoid cars slowing for a traffic light in front of him on the highway, the unnamed official said. The star's SUV then allegedly rear-ended two cars, including a Toyota Prius, propelling Ms Howe's white Lexus into oncoming traffic.The widow was struck head-on by a Hummer H2 and killed. Former couple: Jenner (left), who stars in reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, is still incredibly wealthy after divorcing from his wife, Kris (right), with whom he shared an estimated $125million fortune . The source's revelations contradicted officials' initial claims that the victim's Lexus had struck the Prius. Before her death, Ms Howe lived alone in a $2.5million house in Calabasas, Los Angeles. The official briefed on the video  spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. Jenner is recently said to have told officers there was no way he could have avoided the collision because the driver in front of him slammed on the brakes. He also vowed to cooperate with police. In a statement, he said: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident. Fatal: It comes as a police source has claimed that surveillance footage taken by cameras on a nearby MTA bus and shows that Jenner started the chain-reaction crash that killed Ms Howe. Above, the wreckage . Scene: Jenner was hauling an off-road vehicle on a trailer behind his Cadillac Escalade when he steered to avoid cars slowing for a traffic light in front of him on the highway, the unnamed official said. The reality TV star's SUV then allegedly rear-ended two cars, fatally propelling Ms Howe's white Lexus into oncoming traffic . 'It is a devastating tragedy and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.' The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is still investigating the cause of the wreck and will consider whether to issue a citation that could result in criminal charges - possibly vehicular manslaughter. However, an anonymous LAPD homicide detective has agreed with Manuelian that criminal manslaughter charges against the former Olympic track runner would likely 'be a stretch'. 'It would have to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he was negligent,' said the source. 'Just because he rear-ended someone, its usually considered an accident. But, the stretch would be that he was inattentive and violated the vehicle code of following too close.' If any of the drivers in the crash are found criminally negligent, they could face up to six years in prison. Five children and two adults were also hospitalized in the fatal collision earlier this month. Officials have said there is no evidence that Jenner was being chased by paparazzi at the time. It comes just days after Jenner's stepdaughter, Khloe Kardashian,  spun off the road and ended up in a ditch while her sisters Kim and Kylie Jenner and Kim's baby North West were in the car. Khloe was behind the wheel of a black Yukon GMC in Bozeman, Montana, with her siblings and Kim's daughter on Saturday when she hit a patch of black ice, swerved and ended up in a ditch. In the aftermath Kim took to social media to thank God for watching over her family and keeping them safe as they all escaped without injury. Their publicist confirmed they are 'OK'. It is not known exactly how much Jenner is worth in the wake of his divorce from his wife, Kris. An investigation into the crash involving him is ongoing.","Bruce Jenner only had insurance coverage up to $250,000, a source says .

"Ferries are set to sail between Florida and Havana once again more than 50 years after services were halted at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Around half a dozen companies have expressed interest in reviving the once-popular route following the historic easing of travel restrictions between the U.S. and Cuba earlier this year. Ferries to Cuba were immensely popular during the 1940s and 1950s but services ended on  February 8, 1963, when President Kennedy  imposed travel restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba. Catamaran broker Brian Hall hopes to start a high speed service between Marathon Key  and Havana . One firm keen to exploit the new developments is Fort Lauderdale-based CubaKat which is planning to run a high speed passenger catamaran service beginning in December. Boats would  leave from a private marina in Marathon key, about 135 miles (217 km) from Havana, offering a high-speed $338 round-trip ferry service with a capacity for about 190 people, as well as some vehicles. CubaKat president Brian Hall said the  crossing would take around four- hours and cost $169 one way or $338 round trip. He said: 'My partners and I are ready to start operating as soon as we get the go-ahead. A former U.S. Air Force C-130 pilot from Atlanta  Hall is based in Jacksonville, Florida, where his family also owns two pizza restaurants. Golden years: Cars are seen boarding a passenger ferry from Florida to Havana in these 1950s pictures . A view of Havana taken from the deck of a passenger ferry before the Cuban Missile Crisis resulted in Kennedy imposing restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba . He said he flew his own plane to Havana in January without a Treasury license, risking arrest and fines, to meet Cuban port officials. 'We were met with open arms,' Hall said. Mr Hall is currently working with with U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to work out certain technical issues including how to prevent Cuban stowaways from hiding on board and coming to the U.S. General U.S. tourism travel to Cuba remains banned with travel restricted to family visits, educational or religious trips, humanitarian efforts, journalism or government business. However the federal government has no way to enforce it and last year some 650,000 people visited Cuba from the United States, a figure some experts predict will race past 1 million in the next few years. At least half a dozen Florida companies are seriously considering ferry ventures, with plans to seek licenses from the U.S. Treasury Department. Among these is Miami-based United Americas Shipping Services - part of a major shipping group with passengers and cargo operations, including Baja Ferries on Mexico's west coast, and Unishipping, a privately-owned, Paris-based company. General U.S. tourism travel to Cuba remains banned with travel restricted to family visits, educational or religious trips, humanitarian efforts, journalism or government business . United Americas President Joe Hinson said the company has met with officials from south Florida's three main ports in Miami, Tampa and Fort Lauderdale. It plans to offer a 10-hour, overnight service with sleeping cabins and dining facilities. Another Florida company, Key West Express, already runs a daily ferry service between Fort Myers Beach and Key West, and has expressed interest in extending the route to Havana. On December 17 last year, the United States and Cuba announced  their intention to restore diplomatic relations. Last month, the Obama administration made some moves to loosen some travel and trade restrictions. While charter airlines already run scheduled services to the island, no licenses for ferry service to Cuba have been issued, according to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which enforces sanctions. U.S. officials have not commented on the status of requests for ferry licenses. Granma, Cuba's official Communist Party newspaper, published an article on Feb. 11 by two Cuban foreign ministry officials saying Obama could use his executive authority to permit ferry services between the two countries.","Several companies have expressed interest in reviving  once-popular route .

"The invite read 'Expect Severe Delays' and the Anya Hindmarch show stayed true to its word running fashionably late. However fans were prepared to wait as the accessories designer's show is easily one of the hottest tickets at London Fashion Week. With her previous catwalks transformed into fairgrounds complete with spinning teacups and supermarkets with working conveyor belts, guests can always expect a good show. Anya Hindmarch transformed the runway into a motorway complete with road workers for her AW15 line . Model Jacquetta Wheeler dons traffic cone colours with a matching bag at the Anya Hindmarch show today . Famous for making the mundane desirable Anya's line of handbags were emblazoned with road signs . And on the final day of London Fashion Week, Anya - who is one of the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite bag designers - performed her usual magic of turning mundane everyday items into desirable accessories that often attract a long waiting list. For her autumn/winter 2015 line entitled The Diversion Collection Anya was influenced by Britain's motorways, with models marching down a catwalk decorated with road markings and overseen by LED speed limits. The London Gay Men’s Chorus dressed in road worker uniforms brought the brightly coloured, high-visibility-themed  show to a tuneful crescendo. As usual the show attracted quirkier characters to the front row including artist Grayson Perry, dressed in his finest drag, as well as Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason. The no U-turn sign appeared several times across her line of leather accessories . The famous Ebury bag that has proven popular in previous seasons received a high-vis makeover . Continuing the motorway theme, the Ebury even saw the service station Little Chef logo make an appearance . Motifs for this season stepped away from the busy sticker theme of her last collection, with bags stamped with traffic signs such as 'road works ahead' and 'no U-turn.' The motorway theme was continued with the covetable Ebury design which has been a sell-out after last year's autumn/winter 2014 collection, in which the designer covered the bags in retro Frosties packet designs. This season however, the leather tote was emblazoned with iconic images of the Little Chef service station. Even the designer's iconic chandelier tassels took on a practical makeover transformed into traffic cones in bright orange and white. This season sees Anya introduce clothing to the brand, but her signature bags were the star of the show, branded with signs including (left to right) a fire exit sign, a 'stop' sign and the 'no U-turn' insignia . Clothing items include bomber jackets and shearling coats complete with road sign logos, while bags were decorated with traffic cone purses and 'no mobile phone' clutches . Certain items from the new line including the Chevron Ebury and Eddie Stobart clutch (pictured) are available to pre-order online for a limited time only . Perhaps one of the most unique items in the collection is the Eddie Stobart clutch that is a miniature replica of the motorway regulars. Speaking to Marie Claire about her new collection Anya says she dreamed up the bright orange designs during her commute. ‘Basically I spend way too much time on the M25! I had this idea to look at the beauty in the everyday, capturing that slightly trance-like feeling you get when you’re in you car on the motorway and you’ve got a clear road in front of you with your favourite bit of music on. 'And this collection is about how you feel in that moment, as well as all of the beautiful imagery of that signage going on around you.' Aside from the roadside chic Anya paid homage to her favourite foodie fashions with other miniature bags including recreations of Polo mints, Yorkie and KitKat packets. A grey clutch was printed with a 'park and ride' sign - a familiar sight in most British towns, if not the catwalk; a military green bag was turned into a portable 'go' sign with a striped handle . Anya also included some of her food based accessories which have previously been a big hit . An Emergency Exit fur jacket also made an appearance on the runway paired with a Free Recovery sweater . The Stop Ephson  bag is the collection's most expensive piece at £2,695 . As well as her usual miniatures Anya made space for roomier bags in the line featuring several leather backpacks dotted with brightly coloured logos. Contrary to previous seasons the AW15 catwalk saw the debut of the brand's first range of clothing having previously only selling handbags and silk scarves. Items in the collection include Emergency Exit bomber jackets and high visibility tabards recreated as fur gilets. Certain items from the logo-heavy collection are currently available to pre-order online for a limited time following their appearance on the catwalk. Anya says that the inspiration for the collection came from sitting in traffic on the M25 . The British designer wanted to capture the trance you fall into while driving with your favourite song on . Anya also incorporated her signature tassels and snake skin design into her road work creations . However, those eager for an Ebury should start saving now as prices begin at £125 for a sticker and rocket to £2,695 for an Ephson leather bag. The British designer's career began at the age of 18 when she was studying in Florence, Italy. Noting that drawstring leather duffle bags were popular, she borrowed £600 to import some to England and quickly sold 500, with a little help from Harpers & Queen magazine. A year later she had opened her first shop in Hackney. Fast forward 25 years and she now runs 60 shops in 17 countries and counts the likes of Keira Knightley, Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller, Madonna and the late Margaret Thatcher as fans. And with people flocking to her site already to secure a must-have accessory it looks like Anya could remain queen of the it-bag for another season. Anya's presentations tend to attract quirkier characters such as the artist Grayson Perry (left) and Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason (right) who both made an appearance today .

"Nasa has managed to get men on the moon, rovers on Mars and probes around Saturn's rings. But it seems the space agency has yet to master how to make an appetising cheeseburger in space. Astronaut Terry Virts' recently tweeted a photo of a strange-looking 'space cheeseburger' wrapped in a tortilla. Scroll down for video . 'Beef patties, Russian mustard, tomato paste, cheese paste and tortilla. VERY TASTY!' Baltimore-born astronaut, Terry Virts, wrote alongside his tweet . 'Beef patties, Russian mustard, tomato paste, cheese paste and tortilla. VERY TASTY!' the Baltimore-born astronaut wrote alongside his post. While it may look disgusting to us, this 'space cheese burger' is the pinnacle of cosmic cuisine. The first man in space Yuri Gagarin ate pureed meat from toothpaste tubes as he orbited the Earth in 1961. When Americans followed the Russians into space they quickly developed freeze dried foods for the Project Mercury missions. Astronaut Terry Virts' recently tweeted a photo of a strange-looking 'cheeseburger' wrapped in a tortilla . However astronauts found the offerings unappetising and hard to rehydrate. By the time of the Gemini missions from 1965-6 the flavours had improved and the menu included shrimp cocktail, chicken and vegetables and butterscotch pudding. Astronauts now make up a panel that tastes the food and gives it a final OK on Earth before it blasts off. Foods are either partially or completely dehydrated to prevent them from spoiling. Imagine the scene: you've just embarked on your mission to Mars and, for your first meal of a several-months long journey, you've got a rather unappetising plate of beetle larvae. This, rather unappealingly, is a scenario Chinese scientists say could be the future of space exploration. They claim mealworms are high in protein and are ideal for long space trips, and to prove it they shut three volunteers away for 105 days and placed them on a diet of just larvae and plants. The volunteers, one man and two women, lived inside an enclosed biosphere at the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. According to the South China Morning Post, the idea has been met with criticism in the West where critics say, despite the high protein content, having to eat mealworms would lower morale in astronauts owing to their unappealing look and taste. Meats are exposed to radiation before they are put on-board the shuttle to give them a longer shelf life. During Thanksgiving, while most Americans roasted turkeys and emptied cranberry sauce out of cans, Virts and the ISS crew broke out the scissors to open bags of freeze-dried, irradiated and thermostabilised food. Their menu included traditional holiday fare with a space-food flair - irradiated smoked turkey, thermostabilised candied yams and freeze-dried green beans and mushrooms. The meal also featured Nasa's own freeze-dried cornbread dressing - just add water. Dessert featured thermostabilised cherry-blueberry cobbler. Food on the ISS today, although still not able to match that enjoyed on Earth, has improved greatly from the early days of spaceflight in the 1960s. Where once astronauts were limited to tubes of pasted food, now they at least have foods that you would find back on Earth (shown)","The image was tweeted by Baltimore-born Nasa astronaut, Terry Virts .

"Jessa Duggar bucks tradition and opts for a pale blush pink bridal gown instead of classic white on tonight's new episode of 19 Kids and Counting, as TLC reveals that last week's season nine return was the show's highest-rated premiere ever. Not surprisingly, the 22-year-old's wedding to Ben Seewald, 19, is a major plot point on this already record-breaking season, and Tuesday's episode shows Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's fifth child heading to the Tesori Bridal in Fayetteville, Arkansas with her family in search of the perfect dress. Although Jessa and Ben married last November, fans are only now seeing the moments that led up to their highly-anticipated ceremony - and her unconventional choice of color for her wedding gown. Scroll down for video . Breathtaking: Jessa Duggar, 22, tried on a cap-sleeved lace wedding gown on Tuesday night's episode of 19 Kids and Counting . Bride-to-be: The 22-year-old posed in a veil at Tesori Bridal in Fayetteville, Arkansas as she prepared for her wedding to 19-year-old Ben Seewald . A clip from the episode first captured Jessa modeling a form fitting white lace gown for her family, including her mother and her now mother-in-law Guinn Seewald. 'Even though Jessa is not a starry eyed bride-to-be, she is still my little Jessa Blessa,' Michelle told the cameras. 'And if I picture her walking down the aisle to be given away to Ben I realize this is a very special moment.' While her family was filled with gasps as she walked out, Jessa announced that she wasn't entirely sure about the dress. Jessa was then compared to Cinderella when she tried on her next gown, a pale pink A-line dress featuring cap-sleeves and a fully beaded bodice. While Ben's mother started to tear up as she watched her future daughter-in-law search for a dress, Jessa began falling in love with the blush bridal gown because of its unique color. Bucking tradition: During the episode, Jessa become enamored with this blush bridal gown that features a fully beaded bodice . Race to get ready: While Jessa was determined to find a wedding gown because there wasn't enough time to order a dress, her mom Michelle Duggar, 48, noted that the trip to the bridal boutique is 'very special moment' Difference of opinion: After seeing Jessa try on a pale pink bridal gown, five-year-old Josie (left) and six-year-old Jordyn (right) discussed what colors they want their wedding dresses to be . 'I've seen some pictures of blush-colored dresses in magazines, and I thought: ""That's pretty cool. That's different,""' Jessa said. 'It's not your traditional white gown.' The footage captured the youngest Duggers, Jordyn, six, and Josie, five, having an on camera debate about what color a wedding dress should be. While Jordyn thought a bride should wear white, Josie chose the unconventional color blue before she revealed that she too wanted to wear pink. For her final dress, Jessa put on another white lace gown, which featured sheer three-quarter sleeves. But she was still clearly taken with the blush dress. Her third option also reminded her of the gown that her 23-year-old sister Jill Duggar wore to marry 25-year-old Derick Dillard last June. Imitation game: Jessa said this dress looked too much like the one her 23-year-old sister Jill wore to marry 25-year-old Derick Dillard last June . Fan club: Michelle watched her daughter model dresses along with the other female members of the Duggar family . Emotional moment: Jessa's now mother-in-law teared up while watching Jessa try on gowns . 'I don't want to have the exact same dress as Jill,' she explained. 'Our weddings are pretty close together, and so I thought maybe it would be fun to have something a little bit different.' Although it is still unknown as to whether or not she purchased her dress on that particular day, fans of Jessa know that she ended up walking down the aisle in the same blush-colored gown that she favored in the store. Tonight's episode of 19 Kids and Counting follows last week's record-breaking premiere, which focused on Jill's announcement that she was pregnant - just one month after walking down the aisle. According to Nielson ratings, the episode was the series's highest-rated premiere ever, as well as the number one ranked cable program on prime time among women. The show was also last Tuesday's second most tweeted reality series across cable and broadcast. The Duggar's successful season nine return was followed by the debut of TLC's newest series Our Little Family, which chronicles the lives of the Hamill family, whose five members all have achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism.","The 22-year-old was joined by her female family members as she headed to Tesori Bridal in Fayetteville, Arkansas .

"When Misha Grimes took home the crown at a beauty pageant her mother Kasha was not cheering her on from the sidelines but from the same catwalk. Kasha, 53, recently made her debut in pageanting after being inspired by her 16-year-old daughter, Misha, to take up the contests. And the pair proved that they shared good genes after Misha finished as second runner-up at Miss Teen Galaxy UK and Kasha as first runner-up at Mrs Galaxy UK - both on February 7. Scroll down for video . Kasha (left) and Misha (right) Grimes were delighted to both be crowned beauty queens on the same day . Misha has competed in pageants since she was 13 years old and proud mum Kasha followed in her footsteps by being named as first runner-up in the Mrs Galaxy UK event this month. Misha, from Cotswolds, says that she fell into the pageanting scene as a bit of fun and never expected it to turn into such a full-time hobby. 'I entered my first competition on a whim - it was totally unplanned and I've been hooked ever since. 'I was competing against some girls that were five years older than me which was very daunting but they were all very supportive.' Misha started competing in pageants three years ago and encouraged her mum to join her this year after the pair were constantly mistaken for sisters despite her Kasha being 53 years old . Misha added that her mum has always been close to the point where they are mistaken for siblings. 'My mum has always been there for me and it's amazing how often we get told that we look like sisters. 'We always get funny looks when we tell people we're actually mum and daughter.' Misha says that her mother has always supported her but finally decided to take on the catwalk after being inspired by another older contestant. 'The current title holder of Mrs Galaxy Europe inspired my mum to do the pageant and after cheering me on over the years she wanted to join in and see what it was all about. 'She did fantastically in her first event both on stage and off stage. 'It's safe to say that if I look anything like my mum does when I'm her age then I'll be over the moon.' Misha, who lives with her dad, John, sister, Anya, 18, and her mum, has competed in four pageants to date and aspires to become Miss Universe Great Britain. Kasha was inspired to take to the catwalk after being inspired by other older contestants . Kasha says that she hopes to changed negative perceptions that often come with pageanting . On her pageant debut, Misha scooped third spot in the Miss Teen GB event in 2012 and has gone on to compete at Junior Teen GB, and twice at Miss Teen Galaxy England, coming in top three every time. She encouraged her mum to get involved and over the last three years the pair have raised a whopping £11,000 for charities including Christie's and Claire House Children's Hospice. Kasha, a holiday rental business owner, said competing has given her a new lease of life. 'Misha competed for the first time three years ago and I've always been very supportive of her,' she said. 'She's been very much an inspiration to me because I've seen how it has changed her life and given here a huge confidence boost.' Kasha added that although at first she was in two minds about entering a beauty contest she has no regrets an thoroughly enjoys pageanting. Misha and her mother have raised  £11,000 for charities through their pageanting . Misha has placed in the top three for every beauty contest she has entered since she was 13 . 'I reluctantly decided to sign up and it's turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life - the support I've had has been amazing. 'I was the oldest person competing at Mrs Galaxy UK - a lot of the other competitors were in their 20s. 'But I worked incredibly hard in preparing for the event and ended up doing very well by finishing as first runner-up.' The mother-of-two said that by competing she hopes to to dissuade certain stereotypes that often come beauty pageants. Kasha says that attending the contests as mother and daughter has bought them even closer together . 'I was desperate to change society's perception of pageants - they do so much good work that goes unnoticed. 'The whole experience has taught me how to be more graceful, confident and compassionate by allowing me to advance my personal and career goals whist acting as a role model within community. 'It's given me a new lease of life - I feel alive again.' Kasha says that not only has competing given her a confidence boost it has even improved the family's relationship. 'Along with my other daughter, Anya, Misha is my best friend. 'Joining the pageants has really changed us as a family as well - we've always been close but this has brought us even closer together.'","Kasha and Misha Grimes entered Miss Teen and Mrs Galaxy UK .

"The Tories have moved in a two-point lead over Labour in the first of a series of polls . The Conservatives have moved into a two-point lead over Labour following a fall in support for Ukip, according to the first in a series of polls for the Daily Mail. The ComRes survey reveals that the Tories are up three points in a month – on 34 per cent to Labour’s 32 – while Ukip has slipped four points to 13 per cent, its lowest ebb since early last year. The poll confirms that with fewer than 75 days to go until the most unpredictable General Election for generations, Ed Miliband has become a significant drag on Labour’s fortunes. More than 60 per cent of voters do not believe he would make a good prime minister and one in four say they would like to vote Labour but are put off by the party’s leader. Even among those saying they plan to vote Labour, a quarter brand Mr Miliband a turn-off, suggesting a significant chunk of his party’s support could be soft – from swing voters – and may decline by polling day. There is also growing concern around the country at the prospect of a Labour government being propped up by the resurgent Scottish Nationalists if Mr Miliband falls short of a majority. More than half of voters – 55 per cent – say the SNP should be barred from making decisions on laws that do not have an impact on Scotland if it becomes part of a coalition government. Of the minor parties, the Greens are faring best. Their share of voters’ support has risen to 8 per cent – their highest showing with the pollster since 2010 – bringing them level with the Liberal Democrats. Though the Conservatives have moved ahead of Labour, the poll is not all good news for Mr Cameron. Voters are almost twice as likely to say that it is time for a change of government – 60 per cent – than say Britain should stay the course with the current leadership, an option favoured by 34 per cent. Andrew Hawkins, chairman of ComRes, said the election ‘really is too close to call’ and it appeared ‘unlikely’ that any party could command a majority. Scroll down for video . ‘The most plausible outcomes are a minority government led by either David Cameron or Ed Miliband, or another coalition which could include the Lib Dems, SNP, Northern Ireland parties and possibly even Ukip or the Greens,’ he said. ‘Britain has not had two successive hung parliaments for more than 100 years. Our first-past-the-post electoral system was designed for stability. That is fine when you have a few strong parties, but as the combined popularity of the main parties has declined so the smaller ones have flourished. Scottish Nationalist MPs should be barred from influencing laws that affect only the rest of the UK if they enter a coalition government at Westminster, a majority of voters believe. ComRes found more than half of Britons – 57 per cent – concede that the SNP should be able to join a UK-wide coalition in the event of a hung parliament. But 55 per cent say it should be not be allowed to make decisions on laws that do not have an impact on Scotland. Forecasts suggest the party is on course to hold the balance of power at Westminster, winning 30 or more Commons constituencies, 24 more than it currently holds. Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated she would be prepared to put Ed Miliband in Downing Street, doing a deal with Labour even if it has fewer seats than the Conservatives. But in return the SNP will demand an end to the austerity which has put the economy back on its feet and insist on a £180 billion spending spree. David Cameron has said a Labour-SNP pact could break up and bankrupt Britain. ‘Twenty years ago, Labour’s vote share under Tony Blair reached peaks as high as 60 per cent, whereas the Tories and Labour can now manage only a little more than that combined.’ Mr Hawkins added: ‘The political landscape has changed, probably permanently. ‘A system built for certainty is delivering the precise opposite . . . ComRes will be tracking voter opinion across the country throughout the coming campaign and afterwards – for not only is the election outcome hard to predict, but the uncertainty is likely to continue for weeks, months and possibly years to come.’ The latest weekly poll for Lord Ashcroft put Ukip on 11 per cent, a record low since the peer began national polling last May, though it gave Labour a four-point lead, with 36 per cent to the Tories’ 32 per cent. Populus had the two main parties level pegging – with 32 per cent each – and Ukip on 15 per cent. In his latest election campaign speech, Mr Cameron yesterday stepped up his pitch for the ‘grey vote’ as he explained his commitment to protect a raft of universal benefits if he wins a second term. The Prime Minister said all pensioners would continue to receive the winter fuel allowance, free bus passes, TV licences for over-75s, and free prescriptions and eye tests as long as he is in office. Despite criticism that the elderly have been unfairly shielded from cuts targeted at working-age benefit claimants, Mr Cameron insisted the younger generation shared his priorities. Speaking in Hastings, he said: ‘Older people need us. They have done so much for us – this is the least we can do for them. ‘And I’ll tell you what – the younger generation agree . . . Like me, [they] want nothing more than for the older generation to be given the dignity and security they deserve.’ He insisted Labour’s plans to means-test benefits for pensioners would save only a ‘paltry’ 4 per cent of their costs. By Andrew Hawkins, Chairman of ComRes . It may be a cliché, but the election on May 7th really is too close to call. The most plausible outcomes are a minority government led by either David Cameron or Ed Miliband, or another coalition which could include the Lib Dems, SNP, Northern Ireland parties and possibly even UKIP or the Greens. The one unlikely outcome at this stage appears to be a majority for any party. This is not supposed to happen. Britain has not had two successive hung parliaments for more than 100 years. Our first-past-the-post electoral system was designed for stability. That is fine when you have a few strong parties, but as the combined popularity of the main parties has declined so the smaller ones have flourished. Twenty years ago Labour’s vote share under Tony Blair reached peaks as high as 60%, whereas the Tories and Labour can now manage only a little more than that combined. The political landscape has changed, probably permanently. A system built for certainty is delivering the precise opposite. In the long term, this makes constitutional change look almost certain. Nothing is off the table, including House of Lords reform, online voting and giving 16- and 17-year-olds the vote. Just four years after the referendum on AV, we may even see proportional representation for general elections back on the cards. In the shorter term, it looks increasingly likely that Labour will have more seats than the Conservatives in May but get fewer votes. Today sees the launch of our new poll series for the Daily Mail, and it reveals a nation anxious for political change but just as nervous about Ed Miliband as Prime Minister. If, as today’s voting intention poll finds, Labour ends up two percentage points behind the Tories nationally, the electorate will have reluctantly thrust Mr Miliband into the top job with a pitifully small and probably unsustainable mandate. That is why it is so important to be able to bring the very latest political insight and analysis to Daily Mail readers. ComRes will be tracking voter opinion across the country throughout the coming campaign and afterwards. For not only is the election outcome hard to predict, but the uncertainty is likely to continue for weeks, months and possibly years to come.","First poll reveals Conservaties have 34 per cent compared to Labour's 32 .

"Broadchurch's final twist left some fans of the murder mystery disappointed last night as stars David Tennant and Olivia Colman confirmed they will return for a third series. As the second series of the Dorset-based whodunnit drew to a close last night, viewers were torn between praising the show's actors, and expressing their disbelief at the final scenes. And while some viewers were excited to learn at the end of the episode that the show will return, others took to Twitter to complain they had seen enough. Broadchurch stars David Tennant and Olivia Colman have confirmed they will return for series three, but some fans of the murder mystery have expressed their disappointment with the way the second series ended . Last week, fans had been left in suspense with the jury about to declare Joe Miller guilty, or not guilty of murdering Danny Latimer, and wondering if the identity of the Sandbrook killer, or killers, would ever be revealed. And while last night's episode saw many of the show's plot-lines tied up, not all reached the conclusions viewers might have hoped for. Tennant's DI Alec Hardy and Colman's DS Ellie Miller were reconciled, and mystery surrounding the fate of the Sandbrook cousins finally unfolded - but Joe walked free, only to be banished to Sheffield and told he would never see his children again. Last night's viewing figure peaked at 8.26 million, with an average of 7.85 million and a 33.7 per cent audience share. Hinting at the show's rather depressing ending, presenter Christian O'Connell wrote on Twitter: 'If Radiohead made TV shows... #BroadchurchFinale' Viewer Sophie H was not excited to learn that a third series of Broadchurch is in the works . Ex-Radio One DJ Chris Moyles admitted he had been frustrated by the show, but described it as 'brilliant' Lorraine Kelly praised the drama, and put forward her thoughts on the next series . The final instalment was down on the first series, which peaked at 9.3 million viewers in its last outing, but did boast the highest rating episode of the series - far more than the 5.8million who tuned in last week and the initial 7.6million who watched the first episode of the second series. Viewers' responses, as they had been for much of the series where the murder mystery was transformed into a courtroom drama were mixed, with not all welcoming news of further episodes. Hinting at the show's rather depressing ending, presenter Christian O'Connell wrote on Twitter: 'If Radiohead made TV shows... #BroadchurchFinale'. And viewer Sophie H wrote on the social network: 'They are all dead, imprisoned or having a picnic on the beach. No series 3. No cliffhangers. No cliffs. Just NO. Spare my soul. #Broadchurch'. Another Twitter user, IncrediblyRich wrote: 'WELL THANK GOD THAT'S OVER AND DONE WITH. *closes #Broadchurch file and throws it down a deep ravine never to be seen again*'. Last week, fans had been left in suspense with the jury about to declare Joe Miller guilty, or not guilty of murdering Danny Latimer . Former The Only Way Is Essex star Maria Fowler said she enjoyed the series, but found the plot 'slow' Actress Hayley Tamaddon was one viewer excited to see the series make a return . Rosie Goldsmith took to Twitter to describe the final episode and 'weak, amoral and disappointing' And some Sheffield-based viewers were angry that  Joe's exile to the Yorkshire city was seen as a fitting punishment. Deputy council leader Harry Harpham said: 'It's a fantastic drama but that part did make me sit up and take notice."" The Labour councillor added: 'I have thoroughly enjoyed both series but I would not like child murderers to be sent up to Sheffield. That is not the image I want the rest of the country to think of Sheffield. 'This is the best city in Britain by a country mile.' Another councillor Roger Davison, said: 'It came as a bit of a surprise and it's a little insulting to Sheffield. 'I don't think anybody wants a load of criminals in their city.' His wife Catherine Davison also watched the show and said: 'They probably think Sheffield is an exotic place and a long way away from Dorset. 'Sheffield is like a big village, everyone knows each other and is very low on crime."" She added: 'Broadchurch was a very complicated show but I will watch anything with David Tennant in.' Twitter user Charles Hartley was thought Joe being exiled to Sheffield did not fit his crime . While the first series had much of the nation gripped, eager to discover who had killed Danny Latimer, many fans were not as taken with the show's second outing . But those who praised the show included former Radio One DJ Chris Moyles, who wrote: 'It's kept me riveted and made me angry, frustrated, emotional etc but overall, Broadchurch has been brilliant television.' And after expressing her initial shock at Joe's acquittal, Lorraine Kelly added: 'That was a very good piece of drama. Big congrats to all concerned. #Broadchurch - will there be a spin off with the lawyers???' The murder mystery, which came to the end of its second season last night, attracted an average audience of more than nine million viewers across the two series, including those who watched via catch-up services. No details about the other cast members who will be joining DI Hardy and DS Miller have been revealed and filming dates will be confirmed at a later date, broadcaster ITV said. Creator and writer Chris Chibnall said: 'We've been overwhelmed that nine million people every week have continued to join us on the twists and turns of Broadchurch. This third chapter has been a glint in my eye for a long time and I'm thrilled to be writing these characters once again.' ITV's director of drama Steve November said: 'Chris Chibnall knows exactly how to keep viewers guessing and I'm delighted that he is going to take the story on to the next stage.' While last night's episode saw many of the show's plot-lines tied up, not all came to the conclusions viewers might have hoped for . Throughout the series viewers had complained that the court scenes were inaccurate, with some on Twitter even labelling the series 'Boredchurch' Twitter user Katie was not happy with how series two of Broadchurch had ended . While the first series had much of the nation gripped, eager to discover who had killed Danny Latimer, many fans were not as taken with the show's second outing. Throughout the series viewers had complained that the court scenes were inaccurate, with some on Twitter even labelling the series 'Boredchurch'. Fans had also expressed their disbelief at some scenes, including last week's kiss between two middle-aged women many had mistaken for sisters, and characters getting table service at chicken restaurant chain Nando's. Two weeks ago, viewers were shocked to see a 'Fifty Shades of Grey' scene in which Lee Ashworth is seen 'strangling' his wife Claire as the pair engaged in a sexual encounter in the ruins of a clifftop barn. ITV said the murder mystery, which came to the end of its second season last night, attracted an average audience of more than nine million viewers across the two series . No details about the other cast members who will be joining Tennant's DI Alec Hardy and Colman's DS Ellie Miller have been revealed and filming dates will be confirmed at a later date . Fans also complained that they were finding it harder to understand David Tennant - because his accent has become 'more Scottish'. The actor, who plays dour Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, received widespread praise for his performance in the first series of the acclaimed show. But a number of viewers  complained that they found it increasingly difficult to understand his accent as the second series got underway. Tennant's DI Alec Hardy and Colman's DS Ellie Miller were reconciled, but Joe walked free, only to be banished to Sheffield and told he would never see his children again . Last night's viewing figure peaked at 8.26 million, with an average of 7.85 million and a 33.7% audience share . Elsewhere, mother Beth Latimer, played by Jodie Whittaker, prompted ridicule when she returned to court to witness the trial of Joe Miller a short time after an easy water birth. The criticism led to Tennant to jump to the show's defence, saying the second series of the show is a victim of its own success. He said: 'I think we're a victim of our success to be honest. The first series was such an extraordinary thing. This country, we never allow lightning to strike twice in this country...we just don't let that happen. 'So, inevitably there was going to be a certain amount of ""it's not as good as the first time"". 'I think it is. I think it's a wonderful series that I'm very proud to be part of.' The US version of the murder-mystery, also starring Tennant, has not being renewed for a second series, according to reports. Viewers were left baffled when lawyer Jocelyn Knight and newspaper editor Maggie Radcliffe shared a romantic kiss during a cliff-top picnic - despite many thinking they were related . Viewers accused Broadchurch of taking inspiration from 'Fifty Shades of Grey' following this charged scene between Lee Ashworth and Claire on last week's show . Ascene showing David Tennant's character being given table service at Nando's also sparked comment . Viewers also criticised the fact that Beth Latimer (pictured) had returned to court to witness Joe Miller's trial just after giving birth .","Series two of Dorset-based murder mystery came to an end last night .

"Water fluoridation above a certain level is linked to 30 per cent higher than expected rates of an underactive thyroid.  The gland is found in the neck . Weight gain and depression caused by  an underactive thyroid is linked to high levels of fluoride in the water supply, scientists have claimed. A study published today has revealed water fluoridation above a certain level is linked to 30 per cent higher than expected rates of hypothyroidism in England. The findings have prompted researchers to call for a revision of public health policy, which currently encourages the fluoridation of water to protect the nation's tooth health. Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral found in water, and certain foods including tea and fish. Its main benefit is in helping reduce the risk of tooth decay. As a result the mineral is added to many brands of toothpaste, and in some areas, to the water supply. But researchers at the University of Kent have warned the mineral may be responsible for triggering underactive thyroids. Other experts have however, disagreed with their findings, arguing the research methods were flawed. Public Health England also dismissed the study, adding 'decades of research tells us that water fluoridation is a safe and effective public health measure, and shows no association with reduced thyroid function'. Also known as hypothyroidism, the condition prevents the thyroid - a gland in the neck - producing vital hormones. That in turn, promotes weight gain, causes depression and tiredness in sufferers. The authors, led by Professor Stephen Peckham, at the university's Centre for Health Service Studies, conclude: 'Consideration needs to be given to reducing fluoride exposure, and public dental health interventions should stop [those] reliant on ingested fluoride and switch to topical fluoride-based and non-fluoride-based interventions.' In England, around 10 per cent of the population - amounting to six million people - live in areas with a naturally or artificially fluoridated water supply of 1mg fluoride per litre of drinking water. The scientists examined the 2012 levels of fluoride in the drinking water supply, using data provided by the Drinking Water Inspectorate for individual postcodes. They looked at these fluoride levels in conjunction with the national prevalence of underactive thyroid, diagnosed by GPs at 7,935 of 8,020 surgeries that were eligible for the study in 2012-13. The researchers also carried out a secondary analysis, comparing two built-up areas. The West Midlands, an area supplied with fluoridated drinking water, was pitched against Greater Manchester, which was not. The areas in blue show GP practices where water fluoridation is below 0.3mg per litre, yellow equates to 0.3 to 0.7mg per litre of water, while red shows areas where levels are greater than 0.7mg per litre. The areas highlighted in green are where health authority fluoridation schemes are in place . After noting influential factors, such as female sex and older age - both of which are linked to greater risks of hypothyroidism - the team found a link between rates of the condition and levels of fluoride in the drinking water. Where fluoride levels were above 0.7mg per litre, they found higher than expected rates of hypothyroidism than in areas with levels below this dilution. High rates of hypothyroidism were at least 30 per cent more likely in GP practices located in areas with fluoride levels in excess of 0.3mg per litre. And practices in the West Midlands were nearly twice as likely to report high rates of hypothyroidism as those in Greater Manchester. The authors note theirs is an observational study, so no definitive conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. They said they were not able to take into account other potential sources of fluoride, including that found in dental products and food and drink. But they said their research echoes past studies. While they were only able to look at diagnosed hypothyroidism, there might also be other cases of impaired thyroid function that have not yet been diagnosed, and treated. However Professor David Coggon, professor of Occupational and Environmental Medicine at the University of Southampton, dismissed the study's findings, criticising the researchers' methods. He said: 'As epidemiological evidence goes, this is about as weak as it gets. The scientists argue public health policy, which currently encourages the fluoridation of water to protect the nation's tooth health, should be revised in light of their research . 'Essentially the researchers have shown that after limited adjustment for demographic differences, there are somewhat higher rates of hypothyroidism - which can result from a number of different diseases - in four areas of England that have higher concentrations of fluoride in drinking water. 'It is quite possible that the observed association is a consequence of other ways in which the areas with higher fluoride differ from the rest of the country. 'There are substantially more rigorous epidemiological methods by which the research team could have tested their idea.' Meanwhile Dr Sandra White, director of Dental Public Health at Public Health England, said the body 'regularly reviews the evidence base for water fluoridation'. She said: 'The totality of evidence, accumulated over decades of research, tells us that water fluoridation is a safe and effective public health measure, and shows no association with reduced thyroid function. 'PHE's own assessment of water fluoridation programmes in England found evidence of lower tooth decay rates in children living in fluoridated compared to non-fluoridated areas, and greater reductions among those living in the most deprived areas.' The study is published online in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health.","Study found high levels of fluoride in water is linked to hypothyroidism .
Condition is where thyroid gland fails to produce key hormones .
A sufferer is therefore likely to gain weight, suffer depression and tiredness .
Scientists urge change in public health policy, which promotes water fluoridation to boost the nation's tooth health .
Public Health England dismissed findings and said 'decades of research... shows no association with reduced thyroid function' and fluoride ."
"They fold up their uniforms, bid their colleagues farewell and return home from war. But for many veterans, their service continues to play a role in their lives long after they regain their  civilian status. Now, a striking photo series has captured the dichotomous existence of men and women who formerly served in the US Army, Navy and Air Force. The Veteran Vision Project, created by photographer Devin Mitchell, aims to offer veterans the chance 'to speak without having to say something'.

"The 'love' hormone could be key to reducing the effects of alcohol consumption, according to a new study. Oxytocin, also known as the 'cuddle' hormone, was given to rats by researchers from the University of Sydney and Germany's University of Regensburg, and they found this had a sobering effect on those that also had alcohol. The new findings were published in scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . The 'love' hormone could be key to reducing the effects of alcohol consumption, according to a new study . Researchers gave rats oxytocin and then fed them alcohol. They found the hormone reduced their drunken behaviour . Lead author of the study Michael Bowen said scientists first infused oxytocin into the rats' brains before they were fed alcohol. 'In the rat equivalent of a sobriety test, the rats given alcohol and oxytocin passed with flying colours, while those given alcohol without oxytocin were seriously impaired,' Dr Bowen, who works at the University of Sydney's School of Psychology, said. Researchers found oxytocin prevents alcohol from getting into the areas of the brain that trigger drunken behaviour. These areas are known as the delta-subunit GABA-A receptors. 'Alcohol impairs your co-ordination by inhibiting the activity of brain regions that provide fine motor control,' Dr Bowen said. It appeared the oxytocin prevented alcohol from affecting areas of the brain called the delta-subunit GABA-A receptors . 'Oxytocin prevents this effect to the point where we can't tell from their behaviour that the rats are actually drunk. It's a truly remarkable effect.' Lead author on the study is Dr Michael Bowen, from the University of Sydney . The sobering effect of oxytocin is yet to be tested on humans but researchers are already planning to carry out these studies in the near future. 'The first step will be to ensure we have a method of drug delivery for humans that allows sufficient amounts of oxytocin to reach the brain,' Dr Bowen said. 'If we can do that, we suspect that oxytocin could also leave speech and cognition much less impaired after relatively high levels of alcohol consumption.' But Dr Bowen warned this new research did not mean people could drink and drive with oxytocin in their system. 'While oxytocin might reduce your level of intoxication, it won't actually change your blood alcohol level,' he said. 'This is because the oxytocin is preventing the alcohol from accessing the sites in the brain that make you intoxicated, it is not causing the alcohol to leave your system any faster.' Research performed by the Dr Bowen and his colleagues, along with other studies, have also found taking the 'love' or 'cuddle' hormone could reduce alcohol intake and cravings in both rats and humans. These findings involving the 'cuddle' hormone could help develop oxytocin-based treatments for alcohol addiction . 'We believe that the effects of oxytocin on alcohol consumption and craving act through a similar mechanism in the brain to the one identified in our research,' Dr Bowen said. Their findings could see the development of new oxytocin-based treatments for alcohol addiction that target this mechanism.","The study was done by University of Sydney and Regensburg scientists .

"Annie Edwards (pictured) died suddenly after a house party with friends . A 'clever and beautiful' 17-year-old girl has  died in her sleep after a house party with friends. Annie Edwards was found unconscious after partying with pals in the sleepy village of Ditchling, East Sussex. She died shortly after- just three months before her 18th birthday. Police are treating the death as 'unexplained' after a post mortem today was unable to establish a cause of death and further tests were requested. Her grieving family has paid a sad tribute to their 'perfect' daughter. In a statement they said: 'Our wonderful, happy, loving, warm-hearted, clever, mad, beautiful daughter Annie passed away suddenly and unexpectedly on Friday morning. 'She was at a party with close and loving friends, having a wonderful time, and at the end it seems she laid down, went to sleep, and never woke up. 'We have always found it difficult to believe that someone so perfect should choose to spend their life with us. 'It is now impossible to believe we will never see her again.' Paramedics were called to the house on Friday morning when Annie was found unconscious. Despite their best efforts, the 17-year-old was declared dead at 10.30am. Neighbours in the small village said the girl had been at the house for a party with a group of friends on Thursday night. The owners of the property were believed to have been away when the party was held. One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'The first we knew about it was when we came out of the house this morning and there were police cars and ambulances in the road. 'We did not know what was going on and it is normally such a quiet village - you do not expect this sort of thing to happen, it is absolutely tragic.' Another resident added: 'We did see a man come out of the property looking very distressed, he sat on the tailgate of the ambulance and had his hands behind his head.' The talented student, from Lewes, had been predicted to get three top grades at A-level in Varndean College, and had received an unconditional offer to study English Language and Classical Literature at Birmingham University. Annie was found unconscious after partying with pals in the sleepy village of Ditchling, East Sussex (pictured) and died shortly after . Annie, who attended Southover Primary and Lewes Priory schools, was a huge music fan. A keen flautist she was set to take her grade 8 flute exam later this year, and had recently begun reviewing CDs for a local music paper. A post mortem was held today but did not establish the cause of her death. Further tests have been requested, and an inquest date has not yet been set. Detective Chief Inspector Mark O'Brien said: 'This is a very tragic incident and our thoughts are with the girl's family and friends at this sad time.' A date has not yet been set for an inquest into her death. Annie was three months short of her 18th birthday and in her second year of sixth form at Varndean College in Brighton, and was on track to get three A grade A-levels before her death .","Annie Edwards died in her sleep at a house party with friends last Friday .

"Britain's American-made Apache attack helicopters could be cut back or even scrapped outright because the U.S. is set to upgrade it's fleet. The Army has used Apache gunships since 2001, seeing action in Afghanistan - where current pilots include Prince Harry and in Libya. Despite the helicopters' successes on the frontline, defence sources suggested that the Army Air Corps fleet of 66 Apaches could eventually be cut to around 50 aircraft fit for operations. Britain's AH-64D helicopters face becoming redundant because the U.S. has decided to stop using the model and adopt a newer variant, the AH-64E. The British Army's fleet of Apache attack helicopters could be cut back or even scrapped outright, defence sources have admitted . That means essential technical support for the British Apache fleet will be withdrawn from 2017. As a result, ministers must decide whether to upgrade some or all of the British helicopters to the new US standard, or to replace them outright. Defence officials and Army officers are finalising their assessment of the technical options in an exercise entitled the Apache Capability Sustainment Programme, or AH CSP. Officials are due to present ministers with a list of detailed options in the New Year, with final decisions expected in 2014. Colonel Andrew Cash, the commander of the army's attack helicopter force, set out the options for the Capability Sustainment Programme in a recent public lecture. 'The AH CSP is designed to address the sustainment issue that this raises, and provide the required capability, training and support out to 2040,' Col Cash, the commanding officer of 16 Air Assault Brigade, said. Prince Harry is shown the Apache flight-line by a member of his squadron at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan . Britain's American-made AH-64D helicopters face becoming redundant because the U.S. has decided to stop using the AH-64D model and adopt a newer variant, the AH-64E . 'The technical options are being evaluated, and I expect a decision on the way ahead for assessment by early next year,' the commander told the Royal Aeronautical Society. Listing the options for the programme, he said: 'Do nothing; do the minimum; technology insertion based on the current airframes; update to the US AH-64E standard, or this standard but with UK-specific equipment; or an entirely new replacement attack helicopter.' Some analysts have suggested that the UK could decide to replace its U.S.-made Apaches with the European-made Tiger helicopter, which is currently used by the French and German armies. Military sources told The Daily Telegraph that the Tiger would be strongly opposed by British commanders, who regard it is inferior to the Apache. That means the Ministry of Defence is likely to focus on an Apache upgrade programme. However, modernising existing aircraft is often extremely costly, and insiders expect that the MoD will be unable to afford to upgrade all 66 Apaches. The MoD has refused to say how many of the Apaches will be upgraded, leaving open the possibility that some of the fleet will be left unmodified and effectively redundant from 2017. The MoD told the newspaper: 'There are no plans to remove the Apache capability, on the contrary we plan to update and upgrade the fleet. The number required after 2017 will be taken according to operational requirements. 'Decisions regarding the future structure of the Apache fleet will not have an impact on the current operations of the Apache fleet.'","Britain's AH-64D helicopters face becoming redundant because the U.S. has decided to stop using it .

"It is the ruthless game of property ownership, which sees the ambitious snap up sites in the most expensive areas while others make do with the cheaper, less lucrative streets. But homeowners are playing a real life game of Monopoly according to researchers who have highlighted the dramatic differences in house prices between the highest and lowest priced districts. It reveals the average home in upmarket Kensington costs some 13 times more than Blaenau Gwent in South Wales. Scroll down to search interactive map . Median house prices ranged from £975,000 in Kensington and Chelsea, to £72,000 in Blaenau Gwent, according to the Office for National Statistics . Over the last 20 years, homes in Kensington and Chelsea have soared by 400 per cent - compared to less than 150 per cent in Blaenau Gwent . Terraced houses in Liverpool cost less than a deposit for homes in Kensington and Chelsea, the ONS said . The Office for National Statistics has produced the Monopoly-style graphics to shed light on the vast differences in house prices between different parts of the country. The ONS said: 'For the 348 local authorities in England and Wales in 2013, median house prices ranged from £975,000 in Kensington and Chelsea, to £72,000 in Blaenau Gwent.' Throughout the period from 1995, the council areas with the highest house prices tended to be in London and the South East, with the lowest spread across England and Wales. For instance, homes in parts of West London have soared by 400 per cent over the past 20 years - compared to less than 150 per cent in the Welsh Valleys. 'Since 1995 for local authorities nationally, the percentage difference between the highest and lowest median house prices has fluctuated considerably,' the ONS said. 'This difference was smallest in 1995 at 517 per cent and reached nearly 1,400 per cent at its height in 2002. 'This percentage gap has also been increasing year on year since 2006, having fallen between 2003 and 2006.' A detached home in Westminster in central London now costs an average of £3.8million. Leeds meanwhile has the highest number of commuters outside the capital . At £115,000, terraced houses in Birmingham cost more than in Liverpool - but almost nine times less than in trendy Islington, north London . Despite being one of the most desirable areas to buy a house in the whole of the UK, Westminster has the highest crime rate . On average, house prices in the UK have increased by 6.9 per cent a year since 1980 – with just seven years when the properties fell in value. In the past 35 years, the biggest increase in house prices was 25.6 per cent in 1988, while the biggest drop was 7.6 per cent in 2009. According to the Office for National Statistics, the average UK house price reached £272,000 in December, which is £2,000 less than at its peak last summer but £1,000 more than the previous month. London prices are almost double this at £502,000, although this is also some way off its record high of £514,000 last August. While prices in the capital rose by 13 per cent in the last 12 months, this is a much slower than last summer when annual house price inflation hit 20 per cent. In the surrounding counties, house price growth is rapidly catching up with London, rising by 12 per cent in the south east, 11 per cent in the east and 9 per cent in the south-west.","Office for National Statistics produces Monopoly-style house price study .

"The bar for successfully trashing hotels has been high since the sixties when The Who's drummer celebrated turning twenty years old by taking off his clothes and driving a car into a swimming pool. While the damage done to suites nowadays is no less devastating, some argue the barometer for rock and rock room trashing is petering off. Ash, cigarette burns and rubbish are  more likely to be left behind by reality stars and manufactured pop artists rather than smashed works of art and TV sets. Scroll down for video . Celebrities from all walks of life have been trashing hotel rooms for years causing catastrophic damage . Still, the dying art is still very much alive as reality TV star Scott Disick proved weeks earlier when he wrecked havoc in a hotel in Colorado. Whatever the occasion, it never basks those involved in glory. MailOnline Travel recaps the top ten most memorable moments of hotel destruction and those who had to pay the price. Scott Disick - 2015 . Best known as Kourtney Kardashian’s wayward partner in MTV’s Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Scott Disick grabbed the limelight last month for allegedly tearing up a  hotel room while on holiday in Aspen in Colorado. Scott Disick with his partner Kourtney Kardashian not long after the incident at Hotel Jerome in Colorado . TMZ reported that the 31-year-old had been staying at Hotel Jerome when things escalated and one of his party jumped over the lobby bar to nab a bottle of alcohol. A hotel source said guests had complained about the stink of marijuana coming from the star's room and the next morning management discovered empty bottles and cigarette butts littering the room. The party spent $1,440 on drinks that evening and the next day and the hotel slapped on an extra $500 fine as the room was supposed to be non-smoking. Hotel Jerome in Aspen where Scott Disick reportedly left his room in disarray and got fined for smoking . Hotel Jerome lobby: Things escalated and one of his party jumped over the lobby bar to grab alcohol . Keith Moon, the Who – 1967 . If modern day celebrities think they’re behaving dangerously by smoking indoors, they ought to look up Keith Moon. The drummer from the Who will go down in hotel trashing history for his 20th birthday celebrations at a Holiday Inn in Flint, Michigan, following a concert by the band. Carnage ensued after a giant cake with a girl inside was delivered. The Who's drummer Keith Moon trashed a hotel in Michigan, took off his clothes and drove a car into a pool . A Holiday Inn in Michigan (left) and a Lincoln Continental (right) similar to the one Moon crashed into the pool . Moon initiated a food fight which lead to fire extinguishers being emptied in the hotel's hallways. Furniture was tossed about and the police were quickly called. Moon stripped completely naked (although some reports say he kept his underwear on) and made a dash to get away. After streaking through the lobby he jumped into a car, a Lincoln Continental, in the car park and drove it through a fence into the hotel’s pool. Still set on escape he tried to run again, slipped on some marzipan and knocked out his front tooth. The star spent the night in jail, notched up $24,000 in damages and the band received a lifetime ban from all Holiday Inns. Rolling Stones – 1972 . Keith Richards set the benchmark for rock star misbehaviour when he threw a TV set out of a tenth storey window of the Hyatt West Hollywood in Los Angeles. The balconies are now enclosed so you have to smash a window to be able to do the same thing. Keith Richards set the benchmark for bad behaviour by throwing a TV out of Hyatt West Hollywood in LA . His bandmate Mick Jagger once said: 'Be considerate of other hotel guests - trash your room by 10pm' Amanda Bynes – 2013 . The actress reportedly left pools of grime, rubbish and ash behind after she was asked to leave the Ritz Carlton following a nine day stay at the New York venue. According to TMZ, guests had complained about her smoking and alleged drug use and for being rude to staff. Pictures emerged shortly afterwards of the room’s poor state with food, beauty products, linen and cigarette ash strewn about. Amanda Bynes was asked to leave the Ritz Carlton following a nine day stay at the New York venue . She left behind cigarette ash  on many surfaces, expensive products and had taken down the smoke alarm . The smoke detector had been wrenched from the ceiling and left on a side table by the bed. The then 27-year-old former child star faced a $9,000 bill and was later forcibly hospitalised following concern about her mental state. Nirvana – 1993 . As trails of destruction go, this is probably one of the most blatant; a reporter was with the band for the entire debacle. After an interview with MTV News’ Kurt Loder Nivana’s drummer Dave Grohl and bassist Kirst Novoselic retired to a hotel room in St Paul, Minnesota. Nivana’s drummer Dave Grohl and bassist Kirst Novoselic (left)  trashed two hotel rooms in the company of reporter Kurt Loder (right) in a a hotel room in St Paul, Minnesota . Loder joined them and at about 4am, he says, Kurt and Dave started smashing pictures against the wall and destroying anything they could lay their hands on. Security was sent up so the group made a beeline to Loder’s room where the carnage continued. A coat stand was used to break a TV set and they faced a $19,000 bill the next day. Loder later said he was trying to stop them throughout. Florence Welch - 2012 . Her voice may be angelic but it appears her behaviour is not always. The singer confessed in an interview to an alcohol fuelled rampage after a night partying with Kanye West that culminated in setting her room at New York’s Bowery Hotel alight. Welch confessed  to an alcohol fuelled rampage culminating in setting her room at the Bowery Hotel alight . Florence Welch  drunk 17 dirty martinis before losing her phone, ripping her dress and chipping her tooth . She explained to Q Magazine; ‘I think I must have had about 17 dirty martinis. I lost my phone and ripped my dress very badly. I accidentally set fire to The Bowery Hotel because I’d left a cinnamon tea light burning. ‘I came back to the hotel, passed out in my ripped dress — no phone, chipped tooth — came round and there was black stuff all over the wall, my book had melted on the bedside table and there was a bucket of water on the floor.’ Amy Winehouse – 2007 . A ruckus was heard coming from singer Amy’s room, which she was staying in with husband Blake Fielder Civil, at London’s Sanderson Hotel. Guests called security on hearing the clattering of furniture and screaming from the £500 a night room. Winehouse and her husband Blake emerged battered and bruised  and blood was found on the hotel's walls . Guests called security on hearing the clattering of furniture and screaming from the £500 a night room . The couple emerged  battered and bruised and their room was found to be in disarray with a scratched floor and smashed table. It cost the hotel £9,000 to mop up the mess and a source told the Sunday Mirror that specialists were called in to remove blood from the walls. Lindsay Lohan – 2012 (and 2007) Keen to throw a good party, the actress allegedly caused $50,000 worth of damage to her suite in New York’s Union Square W Hotel. According to a hotel source, the then-26-year-old’s floor was so littered with cigarette burns that the carpet had to be changed and cleaning staff took months to pull the room back into shape. It wasn’t her first transgression; in 2007 she allegedly trashed Room 645 at Shutters on the Beach Hotel in Santa Monica after a three night stay with her ex-boyfriend.

An unnamed source told Star magazine at the time: ‘There was filth everywhere and the room stank of cigarette smoke.... There was also a bloody syringe that someone left lying on the bedside table on a room-service tray. Hotel security photographed it before calling someone to remove it, because it was considered hazardous waste.’ Lindsay was blacklisted from the latter. Johnny Depp – 1994 . One of the most unlikely excuses for a demolished hotel room comes from the Pirates of the Caribbean actor. While staying at the Mark Hotel in New York in 1994 he was arrested on suspicion of criminal mischief.

The charges were dropped when he agreed to pay almost $10,000 in damages and fees. Depp blamed the mess on an armadillo that has been hiding in a wardrobe, although it was never found. Edie Sedgwick – 1965 . Andy Warhol’s muse was apparently deemed such a liability she was put in room 105 at the Chelsea Hotel above the lobby where she could be more carefully monitored. Edie Sedgwick would routinely fall asleep with candles burning and set her room at the Chelsea Hotel on fire . While staying at the New York hotel in the Sixties she would routinely fall asleep with candles burning. Despite a warning about the fire hazard from Leonard Cohen, the screen beauty set fire to her room in 1966, reportedly leading the hotel to take the preventative action.","Last month Scott Disick landed a fine for a drunken party in a Aspen hotel .

"Emma Sheppard, 33, pictured, was jailed for two years after she admitted using homemade 'stingers' to disable three police cars on New Year's Eve . An eco-warrior who disabled three squad cars rushing to New Year Eve call-outs with homemade 'stingers' wanted to 'give the police a taste of their own medicine'. Emma Sheppard, 33, of no-fixed-abode, left the lumps of wood, embedded with nails across the road from Emersons Green police station in Bristol. The homemade devices were hidden inside takeaway boxes and covered with leaves on New Year's Eve last. Bristol Crown Court heard that three police cars were damaged by the improvised devices as they responded to emergency call outs, destroying four tyres and causing £1,500 worth of damage. Sheppard, who denied she was an anarchist, later said her actions were in protest at the death of a black teenager in America, police brutality in Greece and cuts to legal aid. The carer, who admitted one charge of conspiracy to commit criminal damage being reckless as to whether life was endangered, remained emotionless as she was jailed. Judge Neil Ford QC, the Recorder of Bristol, said that anarchists in the city had caused £20 million of damage to police, commercial buildings and mobile phone providers in the past four years. 'Responsibility in relation to these incidents has been claimed by what have been described as anarchist groups,' the judge told Sheppard. 'I must make it clear from the start that your offending cannot be linked to that course of conduct, although of course this forms a backdrop to the sentencing process in this case.' The judge said Sheppard had been caught trying to flee the scene by police officers who spotted her acting suspiciously with another person, who has not been identified. Sentencing her at Bristol Crown Court to two years in prison, Judge Neil Ford, QC, told her: 'This was an attack carried out on New Year's Eve when the police were likely to have a high number of calls because of revelry and drunken behaviour. 'This is particularly surprising for someone of your intelligence and behaviour. 'You targeted police officers who act to protect members of the public. 'This must be a demonstration to others that behaviour like this will be met with custodial sentences. 'Actions carried out as part of a campaign of deception will be met by very serious punishment.' Scroll down for video . Sheppard and a second unidentified individual, left the improvised stingers outside a Bristol Police Station on New Year's Eve, to disable any squad cars responding to an emergency call for assistance . The stingers were camouflaged in takeaway boxes covered in leaves and damaged three squad cars . Bristol Crown Court heard how Sheppard built the devices in protest at officers using them around the UK and other police incidents. The judge added: 'You have told the probation service that when you carried out this offence you had in mind a very well covered case in America of the police reaction to a black man. 'You said you had in mind police brutality in Greece and your own experiences with police at protests you had attended. 'What you have failed to take into account is who it is who it is that is there to protect the people who suffer from domestic abuse. 'The people who are there for the victims of serious violence, the people who arrive at emergency road collisions. Officers called colleagues for back-up and the three police cars accelerated out of the police station at Concorde House, a building on an industrial estate. The first driver passed over the debris but suffered a slow puncture and lost control of the vehicle as he approached a nearby dual carriageway, the court heard. The second car immediately suffered two punctured tyres and had to stop, while the third vehicle had one of its tyres punctured by the stinger despite trying to avoid it. 'The devices which had been secreted under the debris were a number of handmade stingers, fashioned from blocks of wood,' the judge said. 'Each contained five large, prominent nails.' Sheppard was arrested and taken to Keynsham station where officers found takeaway containers, a plastic bag and leaves in her pocket. The judge said he had received numerous glowing testimonies on behalf of Sheppard, describing her as compassionate and passionate about justice and equality. 'Your dislike of the police generally in my judgment is peculiar for someone of your intelligence and sophistication. 'It is strange for someone with your compassion to take steps to endanger police officers who act to protect members of the public.' Prosecuting, Mark Hollier said officers called for back-up after seeing Sheppard and another person dressed in dark clothing with their faces covered. He said anarchist groups in Bristol had carried out arson attacks on buildings including North Avon Magistrates Court and at a police centre in Portishead. Mr Hollier said there was no evidence to link Sheppard to previous offences in the city but he pointed out that the stingers were also aimed against police. 'While it is a matter of fact that no harm was caused to any person the potential is manifest,' Mr Hollier said. 'Three police cars were taken out of action.' CCTV footage, left, captured the moment one of the squad cars was disabled by the homemade 'stinger' while two police officers examine the scene of the incident, right, where they recover evidence of the attack . Representing Sheppard, Richard Nile said there was a 'juxtaposition' between the caring work Sheppard had carried out and her offending. He said motivation from the attack had come from the death of a black teenager in America and police brutality in Greece. 'It is also partly her own observation of peaceful protest and what she perceived as the police going further than they should,' Mr Nile said. 'She had come to the realisation that police used stingers on quite a wide scale. What she was seeking to do was to give the police a taste of their own medicine.' He said his client had sought to damage one or more police cars but had not intended for further harm to be caused. Bristol Crown Court, pictured,  heard that anarchist attacks have caused  £20 million of damage to the city . Mr Nile said: 'She leads a good life. She is very busy caring for other people and is involved in a number of community projects. 'This is the juxtaposition of someone who works with such compassion and conscience. 'She is not a self-styled anarchist. She puts her time to good use in her community work. 'She has formed this negative view of the police. She has strayed beyond what is reasonable and respectful and has committed this serious offence. 'She very much regrets that. She has strayed beyond what she should have done and is realising the impact of it on those around her. 'She's quite ashamed of the way she has let everyone down.' Detective Inspector Andy Bevan of Avon and Somerset Police said: 'We have a long and proud history of facilitating peaceful protest and also supporting people who choose alternative lifestyles. 'We respect their right to lead their lives however they choose and the large majority do so in a safe and law-abiding manner. 'Where protest crosses the line into criminality, we'll take a tough stance in order to keep our communities safe and feeling safe.'","Emma Sheppard left homemade 'stingers' outside a Bristol police station .

"A woman who survived a shotgun attack by her jealous husband but then lost her son to suicide has revealed how she had suffered domestic violence for 18 years. As she launched a campaign to help victims of domestic violence, Rachel WIlliams said: 'I was in an absuive relationship for 18 years that began when I was only 17.' Rachel  was shot in the leg at point blank range when estranged husband Darren burst into the hairdressers in Newport, South Wales, where she was working. Mrs Williams survived the 2011 attack, but her husband then killed himself. Their son Jack, 16, was found hanged just weeks later. Rachel Williams, who survived a shotgun attack by her jealous husband but lost her son to suicide, had launched a campaign to help victims of domestic violence . Now Mrs Williams has joined forces with a domestic violence charity, and is calling for children to be educated on healthy relationships in school in the hope it will prevent a similar tragedy. 'I was about 19 and seven months pregnant when Darren was first violent with me. He lifted me off the floor by my throat and didn’t drop me until I was blue in the face. 'After he would hurt me Darren would apologise and tell me he loved me, that he couldn’t live without me and that he would kill himself if I left. 'I didn’t know any different. Domestic violence was all I’d known.' Rachel Williams, pictured in hospital,  was shot in the leg at point blank range when estranged husband Darren burst into the hairdressers in Newport, South Wales, where she was working . Mrs Williams, pictured with husband Darren on their wedding day, says he was first violent towards her when she was 19, and seven months pregnant . The inquest into the death of Mrs Williams's son Jack was told the teenager (pictured) had been struggling to deal with his parents' break-up and had tried to remain 'neutral' The violence continued for the next 18 years, until in 2011, 46-year-old Darren Williams stormed Carol Ann's Hair Stylist armed with a sawn-off shotgun after hearing his estranged wife had been having an affair, the 2013 inquest into his death was told. She was shot in the knee and two customers were injured, but Mrs Williams, then 41, was able to wrestle the gun from Mr Williams, a 6ft 7in, 20st former bouncer, who fled the scene. His body was found in woodland shortly afterwards. Just five weeks later, Mrs Williams's youngest son Jack, hanged himself at the same spot, after going to visit his father's ashes. Jack's inquest was told the teenager had been struggling to deal with his parents' break-up and had tried to remain 'neutral'. Mrs Williams survived the 2011 attack, but her husband then killed himself. Their son Jack, 16, was found hanged just weeks later . The scars on Mrs Williams's leg after she was shot in the knee by her estranged husband . But the hearing was told that relations between the mother's and father's sides of the family broke down after the shooting, and that Jack had gone to live with his father's sister. Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner David Bowen said of Jack: 'This is such a tragic death and his death should never have occurred.' 'If my children had been taught about healthy relationships in school maybe they would have realised what was happening at home wasn’t normal,' Mrs Williams said. 'Maybe they would have spoken to their teachers about what was happening in their home. 'I needed help to leave my husband, perhaps that would have happened early if there had been earlier intervention. Mrs Williams is working with the Wales Violence Against Women Action Group to encourage the Welsh Assembly to reintroduce compulsory education on healthy relationships . 'Education could have helped my sons. And it can help young women too. They need to be taught to see the signs of domestic abuse so they can leave before things go to far.' Now in a new relationship with a man she describes as the 'total opposite to Darren', Mrs Williams is working with the Wales Violence Against Women Action Group to encourage the Welsh Assembly to reintroduce compulsory education as part of Violence Against Women Bill, due to go before politicians this week. The group wants one staff member in every school to receive specialist training on domestic violence, sexual bullying, consent, female genital mutilation and forced marriage, which was originally included in the bill when it was first introduced last year but has since been removed. 'There needs to be a strong program taught in schools to show children exactly what a healthy relationship looks like and what domestic abuse is and how it starts,' Mrs Williams said.

"Hundreds of mourners including the Danish Prime Minister have attended the funeral of a filmmaker gunned down as he tried to stop a massacre in Copenhagen last week. Finn Noergaard, 55, was shot dead on February 14 during a seminar on free speech and Islam in the first of two attacks by a jihadi gunman who also killed a Jewish man outside a synagogue. Today Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt was among 750 people who gathered at Grundtvigs Church, Copenhagen, to pay their respects. Around 750 mourners including the Danish Prime Minister attended the funeral of documentary maker Finn Noergaard, 55, in Copenhagen today after he was shot dead during the terror attack a week ago . Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt was pictured wiping tears from her eyes as crowds gathered at the Grundtvigs Church, Copenhagen, to pay their respects to Mr Noergaard (right) Ms Thorning-Schmidt attended the service before joining a procession which followed the hearse carrying Mr Noergaard down a cordoned-off street . Around 40 heavily armed police were present at the service to guard members of Denmark's Jewish and Muslim communities after a spate of deadly attacks across Europe. Jesper Lynghus, a spokesman for Mr Noergaard's family, said: 'The last thing Finn would have wanted in this life was for an incident like this to... push people further away from each other.' Friends of Mr Noergaard paid tribute to the documentary-maker an hour-long ceremony before tearful mourners emerged from the church carrying a white coffin covered in flowers. They then assembled behind a hearse before the coffin was driven down a cordoned-off street. Zubair Butt Hussain, a Muslim activist and former spokesman for the Muslim Council, said: 'I think they have honoured him in a very special manner.' According to reports of the shooting gunman Omar El-Hussein, 22, a Dane of Palestinian origin, fired 30 bullets at the Krudttonden cafe during his attack. Around 40 heavily armed officers watched over the funeral after a spate of deadly attacks across Europe . Members of Denmark's Muslim and Jewish communities joined together to pay their respects today after rising tensions between the two communities in recent weeks . Mr Noergaard was killed with a single shot from a M95 assault rifle, police said, before the cafe was sprayed with 27 bullets, wounding three police officers inside. Witnesses said Mr Noergaard deliberately put himself between the shooter and the cafe. In an open letter, his sisters said: 'We do not know what Finn was thinking in that situation, but we are sure it was not his own security but that of others he was concerned about. 'Finn was a human who took action when help was needed or in dangerous situations.' Known for his documentaries, Noergaard had a special interest in the problems of integration. One of his best known works was a 2004 film about a young Australian boomerang thrower. The Finn Noergaard Foundation, set up by the filmmaker's family to aid 'the integration of immigrants and their children' into Danish society, had  received 50,000 Danish kroner ($7,600) in donations, by this afternoon. An armed police officer stands guard in front of floral tributes during the memorial service today . Mr Noergaard was killed with a single bullet to the head by Omar El-Hussein who opened fire outside a free speech event being held at the Krudttonden cafe, Copenhagen . The funeral is the last for those killed during the attack, after Dan Uzan, the Jewish security guard shot outside a Synagogue shortly after Mr Noergaard, was buried last week. Ms Thorning-Schmidt also attended that ceremony, which was watched over by police snipers while sniffer dogs patrolled on the ground. Around 500 people also attended the funeral of shooter El-Hussein, who was killed by police after opening fire on one of their cordons. Prominent Salafist campaigners such as Adnan Avdic took photographs next to his tombstone, despite the owners of the cemetery raising objections. Police say El-Hussein, 22, shot Mr Noergaard before riddling the cafe (pictured) with 27 bullets, injuring three police officers inside . The service for Mr Noergaard comes a week after similar scenes at the funeral of Dan Uzan, 37, the Jewish security guard killed outside a Synagogue during the same shooting spree . Around 00 mourners also arrived at the funeral for shooter El-Hussein as he was buried in a Muslim cemetery, despite protests from its owners . Meanwhile, questions mounted Tuesday over whether Danish police had done enough to prevent the February 14 attack in which Noergaard lost his life. Unnamed employees of the cultural centre  told the daily Politiken that Danish police sat with their backs to the entrance drinking coffee before the venue's staff alarmed them to the shooter outside. Swedish Mohammed cartoonist Lars Vilks - who fled into the kitchen as his permanent security detail reacted to the attack - said last week he thought Danish police had underestimated the threat against the seminar following the January Paris attacks, in which jihadist gunmen killed 17 people.","Finn Noergaard, 55, was shot dead in Copenhagen attack ten days ago .

"A businessman battling a deadly brain tumour believes spending up to six hours a day on his mobile phone has given him cancer. After going to hospital with a bad headache, Ian Phillips was given the devastating news he had a lemon-sized brain tumour - and has just three years to live. The 43-year-old claims his cancer was caused by excessive use of his mobile phone, as his job as an operations manager for a large firm required him to spend more than 100 hours a month making calls. As well as undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment in a bid to beat the cancer, he is receiving alternative medicine, has changed his diet, and regularly exercises. Ian Phillips, 43, claims spending six hours a day on a mobile phone gave him a brain tumour. He now uses a bright gold receiver (pictured) to make calls . After driving himself to hospital with a blinding headache, an MRI scan revealed Mr Phillips had a lemon-sized tumour next to his right ear. The scan is pictured (it is mirrored, so the left side of the scan shows the right side of the brain) He has also launched a campaign to make others aware of the risks of using mobile phones, which he says are particularly dangerous for children. Mr Phillips, a former rugby player, said: 'I spent my working life on my mobile. I would have two -hour conference calls some days. 'My ear would be red when I left work at the end of the day. I didn't think what it was doing to my brain.' Mr Phillips, head of healthcare diagnostic imaging for a large global firm, was hit by a sudden blinding headache and drove himself to A&E in the middle of the night. He was given a brain scan on an MRI machine which he had installed himself just two weeks earlier at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. The scan revealed a Grade 3 brain tumour the size of a lemon and Mr Phillips underwent a nine-hour emergency operation to remove most of it. But he was given the horrific news that the brain cancer could not be cured and was advised to make the most of the little time he had left. Mr Phillips said: 'I was devastated - the first thing I asked the doctors was what had caused it. 'But I knew right from the start that it was due to my excessive use of my mobile - I was on it all the time. 'I have spent a lot of time since researching this and the number of brain tumours is going up. Mr Phillips  underwent a nine hour operation to remove his   tumour  (his scars are pictured, left and right, after the operation) 'I am really concerned about young children using mobiles - their skulls are softer and radiation from these devices can reach their brains more easily.' Mr Phillips has now invested in a shiny gold hand receiver which he plugs into his mobile to make and receive calls, meaning he doesn't have to hold the phone to his ear. He said: 'I bought a gold one to draw attention to the potential dangers of mobiles. 'Strangers ask me why I use a hand held receiver and I tell them they would too if they had been diagnosed with a brain tumour. 'I tell people that I am convinced my cancer was caused by using my mobile up to six hours a day. 'Even my doctors won't argue with me when I tell them how much time I was spending on it at work.' Mr Phillips estimates he was talking for more than 100 hours a month on his Blackberry - because of his high-pressure job. He said: 'I was a successful rugby player, extremely fit and I never got ill - not even with a cold. But now I have this. 'The irony is that the tumour was discovered on one of the diagnostic machines that I installed at hospitals all over the country.' Mr Phillips, of Cardiff, hopes to beat the cancer with a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy alternative medicine, diet and 'sheer bloody mindedness'. Mr Phillips has been forced to quit his £100,000 a year job due to his illness, and is launching a campaign to raise awareness to the risks of using mobile phones . He said: 'They gave me three years to live but I will prove them wrong time and again. 'The tumour has shrunk to nothing once but it's back now and I'm having chemo again. 'But I am convinced that it will disappear again before my current course of chemotherapy is complete.' Mr Phillips has been forced to quit his £110,000 a year job because of his illness. The former Caerphilly RFC second row forward now spends his time with his girlfriend and his parents Norman and Lesley, mainly watching rugby and visiting the gym four times a week. He has launched a campaign to highlight the dangers of mobile phones, convinced he can inform others of the risks. He has persuaded Welsh rugby stars Rhys Priestland and Jonathan Davies to shave their heads for the Brains Trust charity he supports. He said: 'I will beat my tumour but in the meantime I need to get the message across that mobile phones can be dangerous. 'I used mine too much, I know that - but people need to be made aware of the risks and start switching to hand-held receivers. It could save their lives.' The potential connection between mobile phones and cancer is a controversial debate. Countless studies have failed to provide a consensus about the degree of cancer risk. The key concern is that phones could cause brain tumours. The largest study to date formed part of the Million Women Study, and included around 790,000 women. It found no link between mobile phone use and brain tumours, or 18 other types of cancer. Studies on whether mobile phones cause brain tumours come to different conclusions . Another study followed more than 420,000 users over a 20-year period. It found no direct link between mobile phones and brain tumours. And another piece of research did note a link between mobile phone use and cancer of the salivary glands, but only a small number of study participants had cancerous tumours. Meanwhile another recent study suggested a possible increased risk of glioma - a specific type of brain tumour - for those using their mobiles a lot. But researchers found no increase in brain tumour risk overall. In 2012 the Italy's Supreme Court found there was a 'causal link' between phone use and a businessman's brain tumour diagnosis. Innocente Marcolini, 60, had used his mobile phone for up to six hours a day for 12 years. Oncologist and professor of environmental mutagenesis Angelo Gino Levis and neurosurgeon Dr Giuseppe Grasso gave evidence supporting Mr Marcolini's claim. They argued that mobile and cordless phones emit electromagnetic radiation causing damage to cells and increasing the risk of tumours. But they added that many tumours don't appear for 15 years, making short-term studies on mobile phone use redundant. Experts at the Mayo Clinic in the US note that after evaluating the evidence, members of the International Agency for Research on Cancer - part of the World Health Organisation - agreed there is limited evidence that mobile phone radiation triggers cancer. But, they warn, a series of studies cannot tell the full story, and only time will tell. Oncology experts advise people who are concerned about a possible link between mobile phones and cancer to limit their phone use, or use a speaker or hands-free device . As with smoking and tobacco, the experts say it may take many years for a direct link to emerge. Consultant in medical oncology at Mayo Clinic, Timothy Moynihan, notes: 'At this point, it's possible that too little time has passed to detect an increase in cancer rates directly attributable to cellphone use. 'The bottom line? For now, no one knows if cellphones are capable of causing cancer.' They advise if people are concerned that they limit their phone use, or use a speaker or hands-free device. Meanwhile Professor David Coggon, professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Southampton added: 'Overall, the balance of evidence from what is now a substantial body of epidemiological and toxicological research suggests that mobile phones do not cause brain tumours or any other sort of cancer. 'Because the technology has only been widely used for about 15 years, we cannot rule out the possibility of a risk that only emerges many years after exposure, but that too is looking increasingly unlikely.'","Ian Phillips, 43, had a blinding headache and drove himself to hospital .

"Hoping to keep as much of his fortune to himself, investment firm billionaire Ken Griffin, 46, has claimed in divorce court that his wife is using their children to justify a monthly expense claim of $1 million. As the proceedings continue to heat up between Griffin and his estranged wife Anne Dias Griffin, things are getting particularly nasty given there are billions of dollars and at least half a dozen properties at stake. Attempting to fight back against his former bride's demands for spousal support, Griffin listed monthly expenses that include $160,000 for holiday homes, $6,800 for groceries, $7,200 for dining, $2,000 for stationery, $60,000 for office space and professional staff and $300,000 for a private jet. It's over! Ken Griffin (left) filed for divorce from his wife, Anne Dias (right), last year in Cook County Court in Illinois . So far Dias Griffin has failed to obtain the monies as part of marital maintenance, however the New York Post is suggesting she is now trying a different tact and hoping the judge will award her the monthly million bucks payout as part of her child support payments. The couple, who filed for divorce last year, have three children under 10. In a statement, Dias Griffin said the filing is 'riddled with falsehoods and just another vindictive attempt by Ken Griffin - Illinois' richest billionaire - to punish his family and avoid his clear responsibility under Illinois law to maintain his children's lifestyle.' Dias Griffin's statement doesn't dispute the dollar numbers. But she said Griffin is refusing to give the kids 'the support to which they are accustomed and entitled under Illinois law.' She has argued that her estranged husband is required to fund the children's lifestyle as it was during their parents' marriage and says the expenses are simply an accounting of all the couple's child-related expenses while they were married. Costly kids: In an escalating divorce battle, Chicago hedge-fund billionaire Ken Griffin says in court papers his wife, Anne Dias Griffin, wants $1 million a month for child-related expenses . Dias Griffin is seeking to nullify the couple's prenup and claims Griffin is failing to pay adequate child support for their three kids.. Griffin has fought back at what he sees is his wifes money-grabbing attempt by using their children as an excuse. He said he has even gone above and beyond what he needs to provide and has paid expenses that are solely for Dias' benefit, including a private chef, multiple house cleaners and a house manager/personal assistant. He said that while he declined to fund a $450,000 winter vacation, he did give her $45,000 for a winter break. Griffin said Dias is trying to fund her 'opulent lifestyle' by saying her personal expenses should be part of child support. Crafty: In his filing, Griffin said Dias is demanding money for her own lifestyle 'under the guise' of the children's expenses. Lavish: The couple married at Versailles in France  with performances by Cirque du Soleil and Donna Summer . Mr Griffin also attempted to further discredit his wife by saying she embellished her accomplishments while running her own hedgefund. Griffin, who is worth $5.5 billion, said that he was the largest single investor in the Aragon hedgefund after their marriage in 2005 until 2009. The fund lost 5 percent in 2010 and 11 percent in 2011. 'Under Anne's management, Aragon lost money for four consecutive years,' he said in the filing. Griffin has said that he is paying almost every single expense when it comes to the life of his children that include the salaries of four nannies. His wife has receved around $40 milllion through a prenup the couple had between them. For Mr Griffin, however, it appears enough is enough and he has now cut off Dias Griffin's access to his credit cards and their homes in New York, Aspen, Miami and Hawaii. Ivory tower: Griffin is living in a $15 million penthouse at the Park Tower in Chicago during the proceedings . The couple had married for 11 years when they decided to call it a day for good in 2014, but they separated in 2012. Their three children are aged two, four and six. Griffin, who is estimated to be worth more than $5billion, is seeking joint custody. Dias, who has already secured more than $35million in the divorce, wants the children to herself. She is asking the court to throw out their prenuptial agreement.","Ken Griffin, 45, CEO of $20 billion Chicago investment firm Citadel, filed for divorce from his wife of 11 years, Anne Dias, 44, last year .

"Deaths in England and Wales rose by almost a quarter in just month, shocking new figures showed today. More than 60,000 people died in January, the highest figure for any month recorded in almost a decade. The sharp rise in deaths was linked to the spread of flu and cold weather by the Office for National Statistics. But it comes amid a bitter political row about a crisis in the NHS, including long waits at A&E departments. More than 60,000 people died in January, the highest figure for any month recorded in almost a decade . New figures released today showed that the number of deaths in England and Wales last month hit 60,888. It marks a rise of 11,168 deaths compared to December, and is 11,858 deaths higher than January 2014. The ONS said: 'The high number of deaths registered in January in comparison to the previous month is likely to be the result of circulating influenza and a period of cold weather.' However, Department of Health sources stressed it was too early to be certain about what had caused the dramatic rise in the number of deaths. The ONS publishes data going back to January 2006, when there were 49,005 people died in England and Wales. The number of deaths usually peak in December and January, in part as a result of falling temperatures. However, before this year the highest ever January figure recorded was 54,938 in 2009, some 10 per cent lower than the number last month. A  spokesman for the Department of Health insisted the government had not taken its eye of the ball this winter - and disputed the ONS's suggestion that there may have been a spike in flu deaths. He said: 'Levels of flu have fallen in recent weeks and it is important to remember that these figures relate to deaths from all causes. 'The NHS has been well prepared for winter. We have given an extra £700million to help provide more doctors, nurses and beds. The NHS has encouraged people to stay healthy by having the flu jab and over half a billion has been invested to help people stay warm in their own homes.' Before this year the highest ever January figure recorded was 54,938 in 2009, some 10 per cent lower than the number last month . Figures last week showed how 'unprecedented' pressures on staff in A&E meant for the 15th successive week the four-hour waiting time was missed across England. Emergency departments in England saw 89.8 per cent of patients within four hours in the week ending January 11 - short of the 95 per cent target. The gold standard was last achieved the week ending September 28, 2014. But the figures, released by NHS England, did show a step in the right direction. The previous week just 86.7 per cent of those patients attending A&E were seen within four hours. Experts said it was a further sign of the 'unprecedented' pressures facing the health service this winter. A whistleblower warned last month that the NHS 111 helpline was putting lives at risk as there are too few staff to cope with demand.","Number of deaths recorded in England and Wales leaps 23% in a month .

"A stand-up comedian has been ordered to pay back more than £6,000 in unpaid rent at a rate of just £1 a month - which will take 546 years. Ross Wagman was told to repay his 18-month debt along with a bill for clearing rubbish to landlord Ray Wright, 68, from Bury in Greater Manchester, after he rented an industrial unit from him. The grandfather took his case to a small claims court and was awarded the costs, but will have to live until he is 614 to see the cash. Ross Wagman was given 546 years to repay his 18-month rent debts after a court ordered he could pay it back at £1 a month . Mr Wagman, who has written pilot episodes for the BBC, began monthly payments after the ruling last February but the payments came to a stop in October. Mr Wright claims at this point he had made just five payments - of £5. He said that he had been renting the industrial building to Mr Wagman's family for the last 30 years and considered them family friends. The landlord explained that the Wagman's operated an auctioneer business and bought in and sold items, using the property to store them. When Mr Wagman decided to leave the premises in February 2012 he still had outstanding debts and Mr Wright said he left the place in such a state he filled 18 skips with rubbish. It cost him £2,000 to hire them and he had labour costs for the five people needed to do the work. Mr Wright said: 'When the new chap opened the doors it was an absolute shambles. Bags and goods covered all 2,700 sq ft of the unit. 'It has cost me £900 in court fees alone. By the time he has paid that back at this rate of £1 a month it will be 75 years. 'It's ludicrous. What hurts the most is they were family friends and I helped them out and this is how I've been treated.' Mr Wagman (pictured) had rented an industrial unit from 68-year-old Ray Wright but stopped his re-payments . As well as his comedic work, Mr Wagman, from Whitefield in Greater Manchester, has also been running a wholesale button and craft pack service online called Craft Parcels since 2004. He was a Citylife Comedy Competition 2003 finalist and is known for his 'original, unique take on the world', according to entertainment listing site Ents24. Mr Wagman also runs a blog - The Monkeys All Say Boo - where he shares the bedtime stories he has read with his son. Mr Wright, who took the case back to Bury County Court last week to claim the outstanding £6,559, said: 'He's still trading. I have to do without and he gets off scot-free. 'It's been back and forth through the courts but finally a judge has cancelled the orders that had been put in place. 'It's been a nightmare but I'm not giving up, no way.' MailOnline was unable to reach Mr Wagman for a comment. HM Courts and Tribunals Service said it could not discuss a judgement.

The service is the brainchild of a company called Plus Labs in Mountain View, California. ‘We have trained operators standing by 24/7 to answer every one of your requests,’ its website says. ‘Send us a text message, and we'll get you what you want.’ Trained operators answer the text message requests (examples are shown) and work out how to fulfill the request in the fastest and best way possible. For example, plane or rail tickets can be bought online and then emailed to the individual, while a service such as Instacart may be used to do the weekly shop . Users based in the US text 408-217-1721 with their request. Trained operators work out how to fulfil it and send a text back, asking more questions and then stating how much the service will cost, including a tip. The Californian company behind the service says it can be used for 'anything you want. As long as it's not illegal'. The first time someone uses it, they are send an encrypted message asking for their bank details and address etc. These details are held by another service called Stripe, so this step can be skipped after the first use.

"David Tredinnick claimed medics should look to the stars to take the 'pressure' off struggling hospitals . The NHS crisis could be solved if doctors used astrology, a Tory MP has claimed. David Tredinnick claimed medics should look to the stars to take the 'pressure' off struggling hospitals. The MP for Bosworth in Leicestershire argued that astrology should 'have a role to play' in healthcare. Mr Tredinnick is a member of the influential health select committee, as well as the committee for science and technology. He has also been vice chairman of the government's herbal medicines working group. In an interview with this month's Astrological Journal, he raised the prospect of using it to tackle problems in the NHS. He said: 'There would be a huge row over resources. 'However, I do believe that astrology and complementary medicine would help take the huge pressure off doctors. 'Ninety per cent of pregnant French women use homeopathy. Astrology is a useful diagnostic tool enabling us to see strengths and weaknesses via the birth chart. 'And, yes, I have helped fellow MPs. I do foresee that one day astrology will have a role to play in healthcare.' Last year Mr Tredinnick suggested members of the public with health problems should turn to astrology for answers. He claimed astrology had a 'proven track record' at helping people recover from sickness and should be incorporated in to standard medical treatments. In the new interview, Mr Tredinnick, claimed people who opposed astrology were 'racist'. He said: 'The opposition (to astrology) is based on what I call the SIP formula - superstition, ignorance, and prejudice. 'It tends to be based on superstition, with scientists reacting emotionally, which is always a great irony. 'They are also ignorant, because they never study the subject and just say that it is all to do with what appears in the newspapers, which it is not, and they are deeply prejudiced, and racially prejudiced, which is troubling.' The MP for Bosworth in Leicestershire claimed that almost all pregnant French women use astrology, which should 'have a role to play' in healthcare . He added that opponents to astrology were 'bullies', saying: 'Astrology offers self-understanding to people. 'People who oppose what I say are usually bullies who have never studied astrology. 'They never look at it. They are absolutely dismissive. Astrology may not be capable of passing double-blind tests but it is based on thousands of years of observation. 'Hippocrates said, 'A physician without a knowledge of astrology has no right to call himself a physician,' 'Astrology was until modern times part of the tradition of medicine. I think it is a great pity that so many scientists today are dismissive of right-side brain energy, such as intuition. 'People such as Professor Brian Cox, who called astrology 'rubbish' have simply not studied the subject. 'The BBC is quite dismissive of astrology and seeks to promote the science perspective and seems always keen to broadcast criticisms of astrology.'","David Tredinnick suggests astrology has a 'role to play' in healthcare .

"Urgent new rules were introduced last night to protect journalists and whistleblowers from police snooping. MPs agreed to rush safeguards through Parliament before the general election to curtail the use of the hugely controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. Police will now need the approval of a judge, via an order, before they can access phone records to try to identify a reporter’s sources. Controversial: Police have  obtained the phone records of dozens of journalists, which led to the sacking of three police officers who lawfully leaked information about Andrew Mitchell's (pictured) 'Plebgate' scandal . Newspapers, including the Daily Mail, demanded changes to the rules when it emerged that police had secretly launched spying missions to get the phone records of two journalists investigating wrongdoing by MPs. It has since emerged that police forces have viewed the phone records of 82 journalists over the past three years via RIPA, which is supposedly an anti-terror law. The system operates in secret and there is no provision for journalists to challenge it. Kent Police investigating Chris Huhne (above) used RIPA to obtain a Mail on Sunday reporter's records . The concern was that, if newspapers’ sources are not protected, whistleblowers will be deterred from contacting the Press – and scandals will remain secret. The new rules are a temporary measure because there was no time to change the primary RIPA legislation before the current Parliament ends on March 30. If police wish to view journalists’ phone records they will have to give notice to the parties involved and, if necessary, make the case for disclosure in court. The Home Office said there is a commitment to introduce a law after the election to reform RIPA. The Liberal Democrats claimed the Tory side of the Coalition had been slow to act. Metropolitan Police detectives used the call records of The Sun’s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, to find and sack three officers found to have lawfully leaked information about the Plebgate incident. Kent Police investigating the Chris Huhne speeding points scandal used RIPA to obtain the phone records of a journalist on The Mail on Sunday and one of his sources, even though a judge had ruled the source should remain confidential. In the controversy that followed, the Society of Editors and Press Gazette launched the Save Our Sources campaign, which was backed by more than 100 editors.","MPs  rushed interim safeguards backed by 100 editors through Parliament .

"Met Office workers are preparing to strike for the first time in decades this week causing possible disruption to forecasts as storms continue to batter large swathes of the country. Staff at the Met Office's headquarters in Exeter, Devon, will walk out at 2pm on Thursday in an ongoing row over pay. Workers in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and other frontline stations will also walk out at the same time and set up picket lines for the duration of the three-hour strike. Staff at the Met Office's headquarters in Exeter, Devon (pictured), and at frontline stations across the country including in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, will walk out on Thursday for three hours in an ongoing row over pay . News of the strike came as forecasters warned heavy rain and possible snow was due this week. Pictured: Large waves batter the coast of Porthleven in Cornwall as storms which have lashed the country continue . It comes as forecasters predict heavy rain and possible snow will hit large parts of the country. Met Office workers belonging to the union Prospect are to strike over a continuing pay freeze which they claim is 'damaging an otherwise successful, efficient and growing business'. However, it is feared the strike could cause disruption to the Met Office's weather service as almost half of its employees will be unavailable during the industrial action. Prospect, which has 950 members, warned that the walkout could affect the accuracy of forecasts especially if one of the forecasting models was to break down. A union leaflet said: 'Forecasts depend on the Met Office model for accuracy. That model runs four times a day on one of the most sophisticated and complex IT systems in the country. 'People are proud to run a seamless service to the customer 24 hours a day, 365 days a week. 'The fact that people are now taking action about pay and withdrawing that goodwill shows how strongly they feel and puts the service at real risk.' The escalating campaign of action began last Thursday when union members wrote to Business Minister Matthew Hancock, calling on him to allow the Met Office the freedom to manage its reward system and pay fairly compared to market rates. Met Office workers are to walk out on Thursday afternoon, with fears weather services could be disrupted. Pictured: A couple watch from above as huge waves lash the coast of Porthleven in Cornwall earlier today . Met Office staff believe the continuing pay freeze is 'damaging an otherwise successful, efficient and growing business' and fear it will stop the business recruiting skilled workers. Pictured: Ilfracombe, north Devon today . In the letter, union members argued that the pay freeze was limiting the Met Office's ability to recruit the specialist figures it requires. Workers said they fear that without the flexibility to pay fairly: . The union said it had no alternative but to take action with the three-hour strike on Thursday, but said services with implications to national security and safety of life would be maintained throughout. Gordon Hutchinson, a representative for Prospect, said: 'This is unprecedented, no one can remember the last time people went on strike here over pay - it must be decades ago. 'It shows how strongly people feel about a government pay policy completely at odds with what the Prime Minister advocates for the private sector. 'David Cameron says successful businesses should give their staff a pay rise, but won't allow the Met Office freedom to manage its own reward system.' Three walkers embrace the deep snow and wintry conditions as they hike up Ben Nevis, near Fort William . The bleak conditions come as forecasters warn of further possible snow on high ground later this week . Helen Stevens, Prospect negotiator, added: 'It's sad to see such a magnificent organisation held back by political ideology. 'First and foremost our members want the Met Office and its world class science to thrive. It can't do that if it can't recruit and retain the right people. 'Our members are reasonable people who have tried to resolve this through other means but have found the Met Office has its hands tied behind its back.' The Met Office said it was working closely with Prospect and was 'not expecting any significant impacts'. A spokesman added: 'We're disappointed that some staff have chosen to take this action but we are confident our robust business continuity measures will reduce the impact of the action. 'We are pleased that the Trades Union Prospect is working with the Met Office to ensure that the threat of industrial action is mitigated for any service where safety of life is at risk, for example - severe weather warnings. 'We recognise the right of staff to take this action based on a legal mandate.'","Met Office workers preparing to strike on Thursday over ongoing pay row .

"Three boxes of evidence from the investigation into the 1979 disappearance and presumed death of schoolboy Etan Patz have turned up while a suspect is on trial for the killing, and his attorney said Monday she could have to seek a mistrial or at least recall witnesses who have already testified. Alice Fontier, one of the attorneys representing Pedro Hernandez, said there were more than 1,400 pages of information on the case in one box alone. 'Given this massive disclosure at this point, in the middle of the trial, there may be issues,' she said. 'We may need to recall some of their witnesses. We may need to move for a mistrial.' His word: Pedro Hernandez's lawyers say that he is mentally ill and that his statements to police that he killed Etan Patz  are fiction. Now the entire trial could be in jeopardy after several boxes of evidence reemerged . Fightt for justice: Stanley Patz, at court in New York City earlier this month . The boxes were found recently at a Harlem police station that covers public housing complexes in the area, prosecutors said late last week. The location is miles from the precinct near where Etan disappeared on May 25, 1979, as he walked to school. Etan's body has never been found, and he was declared dead in 2001. The boxes contain police records from the investigation, notes from assistant district attorneys who worked on the case and handwritten memos from a detective who investigated longtime suspect Jose Ramos, who was never charged . . Some of the information involves two informants who were working with prosecutors to try to link Ramos to Etan's death. Other boxes contain missing-person posters, records of people arrested and catalogs of files made by the original detective on the case. Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said last week that prosecutors were working to turn over the information to the defense attorneys. They are still working on copying one box, she said Monday. Outside court, defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said it's unclear what's in the documents but he hopes they won't affect the case and he doesn't want a mistrial. 'We want it resolved for Mr. Hernandez,' he said. 'He's been in jail for three years, so we definitely want to continue this case.' Hernandez, a former bodega worker, pleaded not guilty to Etan's murder after telling police he strangled the boy. Confession: Pedro Hernandez, pictured in 2012, was seen confessing to the murder of Etan Patz in a videotaped confession . The discussion about the boxes of evidence came as jurors watched a second videotaped confession and a shaky cellphone camera video taken by police that shows Hernandez leading them from the former location of the bodega to where he said he dumped the body. In the other video, Hernandez admits to detectives that he choked the boy and put him in a bag, but he says the boy was alive at the time. He sobs while he speaks. Hernandez, most recently a resident of Maple Shade, New Jersey, confessed in 2012 to choking Etan in the basement of the SoHo convenience store where he worked as a stock clerk. He told police he put the boy's body in a bag, stuck the bag in a box and walked it down the street, where he dumped it with some curbside trash. His defense says the admissions were the fictional ravings of a mentally ill man with a low IQ who didn't understand his right to silence. Hernandez's defense plans to call some people involved with the investigation into Ramos, a convicted child molester who remains jailed on a Megan's Law violation. Missing: Patz disappeared on May 25, 1979 and was never seen again. Hernandez said he strangled the boy and put his body in the trash .","Boxes turned up last week at a police warehouse in Harlem .

"The founder of Bikram yoga has been hit with yet another sex assault lawsuit as studios begin to drop his name in the first sign his empire may be crumbling. Bikram Choudhury, 69, has been accused of raping a student during a teacher training event in the spring of 2010 when there was a 46 year age gap between them. Jill Lawler alleged that Choudhury, whose followers include Madonna and Demi Moore, also assaulted her again after saying he would 'make her a champion'. The lawsuit is the sixth such legal claim against Choudhury, who counts Chelsea Clinton and George Clooney among his admirers. Bikram Choudhury has been accused by another woman, Jill Lawler, right, of raping her as a teengager . Choudhury pioneered Bikram yoga, also known as 'hot yoga', which involves participants working out in a room heated in excess of 40C (104F). It has become such a success that are now around 720 Bikram Yoga schools in 220 countries including dozens in the UK. Andy Murray also put his ascent up the world tennis rankings down to Bikram Yoga and David Beckham has also reportedly tried it. But the New York Times has reported that in the U.S., several yoga studio owners have removed Bikram from their names because they don't want to be associated with it any more. In California, Tiffany Friedman renamed her Bikram studio Haute Yogi Manhattan Beach and began offering a different range of classes. She described Bikram as 'cultish' and said that people believed that Choudhury 'was a guru with all these powers'. In her lawsuit Lawler said that that at the age of just 18 she signed up for a £6,000 teacher-training course in Las Vegas in spring 2010. Pioneer: Choudhury, pictured, leads a yoga class in 2003. He pioneered Bikram yoga, also known as 'hot yoga', which involves participants working out in a room heated in excess of 40C . At the time Choudhury would have been 64. The lawsuit states: 'Bikram Yoga was her calling, and that her purpose was to share it with as many people as possible.' Bikram yoga, named after and devised by Bikram Choudhury, is based on regular hatha yoga, but performed in 100F temperatures. Fans claim that it not only leaves them stronger and more flexible than standard yoga, it also helps them shed weight fast. Choudhury began practising yoga in Calcutta at the age of three, spending up to six hours a day perfecting his poses. At 13 he won the National India Yoga Championship and went on to devise the 26 'asanas' (poses) and two breathing methods that form the core of Bikram yoga. He claims to have been invited to the U.S. in 1973 by President Nixon to help him improve his health through yoga. He also claims to have taught yoga to Reagan and Clinton and has a legion of celebrity fans . including Lady Gaga, Madonna, Jennifer Aniston and tennis champion Andy . Murray. Choudhury says Bikram works because the 100F heat loosens the muscles, helping them to go further than they would otherwise. Yogis perform the series of poses, pushing their bodies to the limit, and are encouraged to drink vast quantities of water to replace that lost by sweat. Teachers say that if it gets too much for they, they should lie on the floor or leave the room for lower temperatures. Students, who carry a towel to mop up their sweat, are taught to watch out for danger signs including nausea, lightheadedness and dizziness. Lawler, a Canadian, says that she massaged Choudhury for hours as they watched Bollywood films together and at one point he groped her. He later apologized and said he would 'make her a champion'. Weeks after that however Choudhury asked Lawler to come to his hotel room where he sexually assaulted her, it is claimed. The lawsuit states that Lawler continued doing Bikram yoga for years and that Choudhury's abuse continued on multiple occasions, the most recent being in February 2013. Lawler taught her last Bikram class in July 2014 and is now working as a waitress. She was too afraid to speak up until now, she says. In the lawsuit Lawler states: 'I went through total hell. What happened to me was awful. I'll probably always have bad dreams.' A previous lawsuit was filed by another of Choudhury's followers, Sarah Baughn, who said that in the mid 2000s he whispered sexual things in her ear even though she was 38 years his junior. During one exchange Choudhury supposedly said: 'Should we make this a relationship? I know you from a past life, and I have this feeling about you. 'In your culture, you call it love; I can't love, you know that (he had lectured on his beliefs on love and marriage the night before) but that is how I feel about you. When Miss Baughn rebuffed his advances Choudhury is said to have sabotaged the her career as a yoga instructor. Mary Shea Hagebols, a lawyer for the six women suing Choudhury, said that the cases were all 'moving very quickly'. She said: 'Any stays have been lifted, and we're moving full steam ahead.' Choudhury began practising yoga in Calcutta at the age of four. He went to the US in 1973 at the invitation of President Nixon who was suffering from phlebitis and at the urging of actress Shirley MacLaine. Accusers: Larissa Anderson (left) and Sarah Baughn (right) are among other who have sued Choudhury . Over the years his devotees have included Martin Sheen and Michael Jackson. He now lives in the Hollywood Hills with multi-million pound fortune and a fleet of 40 Rolls Royces. Choudhury is known for being outspoken in his self-belief and has in the past likened himself to Superman or Buddha. He once told a business magazine the key to his success was 'because I have balls like atom bombs, two of them, 100 megatons each. Nobody f**** with me'. He has also raised eyebrows by obtaining the copyright for the 26 postures and breathing exercises that make up the 90-minute Bikram Yoga routine. In a statement Choudhury said: 'Their claims are false and dishonor Bikram yoga and the health and spiritual benefits it has brought to the lives of millions of practitioners throughout the world. 'After a thorough investigation, the Los Angeles County district attorney declined to file any sexual assault charges against Mr Choudhury or the college for lack of evidence.'","Bikram Choudhury, 69, has been accused of assaulting a student 46 years his junior at a teacher training event in Las Vegas 2010 .

"Killed himself: Shayne Austin was once offered immunity in exchange for his testimony against Jason Autry and Zach Adams in the Holly Bobo murder trial . A key witness in the case against nursing student Holly Bobo's accused killers has been found dead. Lawyers for Shayne Austin said Wednesday that the Tennessee man who'd once been offered immunity in exchange for his testimony against Zach Adams and Jason Autry killed himself somewhere outside the state. According to Austin's lawyer Luke Evans, the offer of immunity had been rescinded at some point since Austin first made the agreement last March. Prosecutors took back the offer allegedly after discovering that Austin had not been untruthful and uncooperative. 'It's unfortunate the government came in and made allegations without basis. People had to live with those allegations,' Evans told WSMV. 'Mr. Austin's position was that he was immune not just from being convicted of a crime, but charged with a crime.' After the offer was taken away, Austin remained a person of interest in the case. An immunity hearing was scheduled for December, but had to be moved. 'They have yet to produce any specific incident to support their allegation to prove that he has been untruthful,' Evans said of his client. Meanwhile, Adams and Autry both face charges of first-degree murder and aggravated kidnapping. Zach Adams' brother Dylan Adams is charged with raping Bobo. All have pleaded not guilty. At the time of Bobo's disappearance, her brother told police he saw a man dressed in camouflage leading her into the woods near her home in Parsons, located about 110 miles east of Memphis. Last September, more than three years later, authorities said two men searching for ginseng found Bobo's skull in a wooded area not far away. Bobo, a 20-year-old Tennessee nursing student, vanished in 2011. Two suspects are set to stand trial for her slaying. However, Austin remained a suspect after prosecutors rescinded their offer of immunity on claims he was misleading them . Vanished: At the time of Bobo's disappearance, her brother told police he saw a man dressed in camouflage leading her into the woods near her home in Parsons, located about 110 miles east of Memphis. Last September, more than three years later, authorities said two men searching for ginseng found Bobo's skull in a wooded area not far away . Bobo's disappearance and the subsequent lengthy search attracted national attention as authorities distributed posters with her photograph throughout the South. Prosecutors have not said whether they plan to seek the death penalty. Hearings scheduled for last month were postponed to an undetermined future date. Jennifer Lynn Thompson, Adams' attorney, says state prosecutors have not even told her who found Bobo's remains or where they were found. 'I do not understand what is happening,' Thompson said. 'I have never before been involved in a case where there is no information about why my client was charged.' In the motion to dismiss, Thompson and Fletcher Long, Autry's lawyer, asked the judge to force prosecutors to produce 'all dental record analysis and forensic studies' performed on the skull. Not a care in the world: Zachary Adams (center) also charged in Bobo's murder but defense attorneys for both him and fellow accused killer Jason Autry say the prosecution has produced zero evidence of their guilt . Adams has been in jail since March and Autry has been in jail since April. At a court hearing Dec. 17, Decatur County Circuit Judge Creed McGinley expressed concern that prosecutors had not yet provided key evidence to defense attorneys. He ordered the state to begin turning it over by Dec. 24. Thompson says the state missed that deadline. Then, TBI Director Mark Gwyn -- who has said the Bobo investigation has been the most exhaustive and expensive in agency history -- announced he was suspending all work on the case after District Attorney Matt Stowe accused TBI agents of misconduct. Stowe took office Sept. 1 after defeating District Attorney Hansel McCadams, who had indicted Adams and Autry. The dispute was only resolved after Stowe stepped down from the case and Jennifer Nichols, a Shelby County attorney who was Stowe's co-counsel on the case and who had worked with death-penalty cases, was appointed as a special prosecutor. She is the third prosecutor in the case, which Stowe said is unusual. All smiled: Jason Autry, charged with 20-year-old Hollly Bobo's kidnapping and murder, smiles during a December hearing . He said the fact that multiple prosecutors have been involved, plus the complex nature of the case, have contributed to the delays. 'We're talking about terabytes and terabytes of information,' he said. Attorney Steve Farese, who represents the Bobo family, said the recent developments in the case are 'different' than in other cases, and he acknowledged that the family is concerned with how the case is going. 'But they understand that this is a tedious process and they want to make sure everyone has their t's crossed and their i's dotted and to get this thing done right,' Farese said. Later, Farese added: 'No one should lose focus that this is about justice.'","Shayne Austin was allegedly ties to the 2011 murder of Tennessee 20-year-old nursing student Bobo .

"Hi-tech criminals are increasingly selling live streams of child rape over legitimate chat sites and apps such as Skype for hard-to-trace virtual currencies like Bitcoin, Europol has warned. 'Criminals that sexually exploit children online are becoming more entrepreneurial with technological developments and are profiting financially,' Europe's policing agency said in a special report released today on the commercial sexual exploitation of children online. Compiled by Europol's EC3 cybercrime centre, together with Eurojust, non-governmental organisations and credit card and online giants such as Google and Microsoft, the report paints a disturbing picture of rising online child abuse. Sickening: Criminal gangs recruit disadvantaged children or their own children for the abuse, which is then streamed online via websites such as Skype . The sale of child abuse live streams over legitimate chat sites or video chat apps is much harder to trace than when the abuse is sold from a website. 'The research shows that the live streaming of abuse for payment is no longer an emerging trend but an established reality,' the report said. Criminal gangs recruit disadvantaged children or their own children for the abuse. 'These persons offer homeless children or children from their own family for the sexual abuse by individuals, live in front of a camera, in the European Union or developing countries, for financial gain,' the report said. Filippino police recently busted a paedophile ring that streamed live rape involving children as young as six, the report said. Cryptocurrency: Hi-tech criminals are increasingly selling live streams of child rape over legitimate chat sites and apps such as Skype for hard-to-trace virtual currencies like Bitcoin . Police rescued 15 victims aged between six and 15, and arrested 29 people including gang members and people who allegedly paid to watch the abuse in 13 countries. Over 700 other suspected purchasers of online child abuse filmed in the Philippines have been identified, Europol said. Like using legitimate, mainstream chat sites to broadcast the abuse, payment using virtual currencies such as Bitcoin also makes the criminals harder to trace than if they were taking credit card payments. Last year investigators for the first time came across child abuse being sold exclusively for Bitcoins, the report said. Police and the private sector should monitor the Internet for the growth of alternative forms of payment 'as a potential consequence of further migration from traditional payment systems to a new, largely unregulated digital economy,' Europol said. Bitcoin operates as a two-way currency which can be exchanged for dollars, and vice versa. The notion behind it is to facilitate cheap, anonymous transactions policed by its community of users and is built around trust rather than relying on institutions like governments or banks. Bitcoin's status as a digital currency is debatable. It is entirely a digital product but is not regulated and it has a limit of 21million, which is predicted to last until 2140. The finite nature of Bitcoins means it performs more like a commodity, such as gold. Bitcoin first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. It was created by a hacker whose identity is a mystery, but is known as Satoshi Nakamoto. This is thought to be a pseudonym for the person or group who created it. Each Bitcoin is a piece of computer code that has been generated through very slow computer processing, also known as 'mining'. Users choose a virtual wallet from one of the various providers which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users. Bitcoin's can be bought from specialist online currency exchanges and online marketplaces such as eBay.","Criminal gangs are using live video-streaming sites to show child rape .

"A carpenter looking to build and sell sheds, instead built a home fit for a hobbit. A hobbit that likes its creature comforts. Randy Jones, a carpenter for 22 years, was researching how best to build small storage buildings out of leftover materials when he came across the tiny house trend that has become so popular and spawned books, blogs and a TV show. With years of experience building log cabins he was up for a challenge on a different scale. Tiny houses have to be smaller than 500 square feet but still include all the luxuries of a larger house cleverly tucked away inside. Scroll down for video . Randy Jones originally set out to build and sell small storage buildings but came across the popular tiny house trend in his research and decided to base his first project on J.R.R. Tolkien's description of a hobbit home . As described in the classic book 'The Hobbit', hobbit homes have round doors and are sunk into the ground. Jones covered the roof of his tiny home with ivy to create that effect . Jones' first project is located, not in Hobbiton, The Shire, but in Morristown, Tennessee. Wanting to stand out from the crowd and capture part of the market, an inspired Jones decided that his first effort would be based on the hobbit  houses described in J.R.R. Tolkien's books 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. 'You have to compete. Anyone can build a small house that's a carpenter, so you have to do something unique that people don't know how to do,' Jones told the Citizen Tribune. The 200 square foot home has wood sides, a rounded roof covered in ivy - a nod to the fact that hobbit holes are supposed to be underground - and the famous round door. Tiny houses require smart design inside, and the hobbit house manages to include a full kitchen with farmer-style sink, a full bathroom, a couch, a bed, dining table, a flat-screen TV, and a washer and dryer. Video courtesy of WATE . Jones has been a carpenter for 22 years and was keen to create something unique to grab a share of the market for tiny houses . Inside the hobbit house there is a full kitchen with farmer-style sink, washer, dryer and lots of storage. The house also has a water heater, central heating and air conditioning . The bedroom is separated from the living area by sliding doors and has a twin-size bed that flips out into a queen-size bed to accommodate two . A cozy couch on one side of the living area by the kitchen sits opposite a wall-mounted flat-screen TV. The house has all the creature comforts of a larger home . 'We put a few nicer amenities in it to catch the eye; the sink is one of them,' Jones said. 'The bed is a single, but it flips out to a queen. The dining room table flips up and down to save space. There is a water heater, central heat and air and everything is electric.' Jones has ambitions to build more tiny homes once the hobbit house is sold and is exploring basing new ones on the houses in 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' and 'South Pacific'. His imagination has no end and he has also begun thinking about building homes on barges and adding solar panels. While he aims to continue building unique homes, he will customize them for buyers as requested. The movie 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey', starring Martin Freeman (pictured) and directed by Peter Jackson, was released in 2012 and based on the book by J.R.R. Tolkein . Hobbits live in the fictional town of Hobbiton which was recreated for the filming of the movie outside the town of Matamata, New Zealand .","Tennessee carpenter Randy Jones has jumped on the trend for tiny houses by building one based on the homes described in 'The Hobbit'

"A transgender model who recreated an iconic naked photo of Adam Levine has caused a sensation online when the image went viral. Aydian Dowling, 27, an advocate for transgender issues, vlogger and entrepreneur, worked with Jason Robert Ballard, publisher of transgender-focused magazine FTM, to recreate the image for the magazine's April 2015 issue. Ballard had seen similarities between Dowling's physique and that of Maroon 5 singer and 'The Voice' coach Levine and suggested they did a version of the 2011 pose. Levine's picture was originally taken by Ben Riggot and published by Cosmopolitan in the UK to raise awareness of testicular and prostate cancer. His genitals were covered by the hands of his girlfriend at the time Anne Vyalitsyna. Scroll down for videos . Aydian Dowling recreated the pose made famous by Maroon 5's Adam Levine. He is quoted as saying: 'Some areas of my body used to remind me of everything I'm not, now they represent everything I am' Dowling's recreation comes with the quote: 'Some areas of my body used to remind me of everything I'm not, now they represent everything I am.' As the photo went viral, the response Ballard and Dowling received has been incredibly supportive. '[W]e've received almost unanimous support for it and our attempts at creating visibility for the trans masculine spectrum,' Ballard told The Huffington Post. 'We by no means mean to say that this is what all transgender males look like, but this is what one of us looks like and it's no different from our cisgender counterparts.' 'We've had comments saying ""he doesn't look trans"" which brings up a great point on what does trans even look like?' he added. 'Perhaps we're struggling so hard for our rights here because people have a false sense of who we are. So besides the entertainment factor of a sexy naked man, there is a element of positive visibility too.' Dowling, orginally from Patchogue, Long Island, admitted to being nervous about the shoot but was keen to challenge people's assumptions of what a trans man might look like. 'I’m a pretty vulnerable guy, so I was a little nervous about it. I asked my wife how she would feel and we thought the cause was better than the insecurity,' Dowling, who has been married to his wife Jenilee for three years, told Metro. Jenilee took on the role of Levine's girlfriend, and those are her manicured hands covering up Dowling's private parts. Dowling is on the cover of the April 2015 issue of FTM magazine, which focuses on the female to male transgender community . YouTube.com . Dowling talked about the photo going viral on his YouTube channel, A Lions Fears, on which he also documented his own transition (videos below). In 2011, he was chosen as one of three LGBT persons to have their stories showcased on the Emmy Nominated It Gets Better Project on MTV. Dowling and Jenilee, who live in Oregon, spoke at the time of their soon to be wedding and the challenges transgendered couples face when planning to wed. In 2011 he also launched Point5cc, a clothing company designed to highlight transgender pride. The company also supplies free binders to those in need and offers scholarships, annually, for individual surgery funds.","Aydian Dowling, 27, was asked to recreate the iconic photo of Adam Levine for female-to-male transgender magazine FTM .

"There was shock when Gone Girl – a film that made over $300m worldwide – was snubbed at the Oscars this week. Rosamund Pike, the film’s star, was nominated for Best Actress for her portrayal of Amy Dunne, who is beautiful, intelligent and seemingly innocent; until we learn she is actually a ruthless psychopath taking revenge for her husband’s infidelity by framing her own murder. In the famous shower scene at the end of the film, jaws dropped as Rosamund slipped off her dress and revealed an envious body with incredible muscle definition. In fact, Rosamund had to undergo four cycles of weight gain and loss to suit the sequence of filming. Now, her personal trainer, professional fighter Holly Lawson, explains to how Rosamund achieved such a toned physique... Scroll down for video . Rosamund Pike was nominated for Best Actress at the 87th Academy Awards in Los Angeles, US for her portrayal of Amy Dunne in Gone Girl.  Rosamund is pictured wearing a hot red Givenchy Haute Couture gown to the ceremony . Sizzling in a slitted strapless Givenchy gown! Check out more Givenchy designs at Neiman Marcus . Visit site . Just a few weeks after giving birth, Rosamund Pike shows off an absolutely enviable waist line in a corseted, strapless, slitted Givenchy gown.  Obviously made just for her, this dress shows off her incredible almost unearthly figure! We are absolutely entranced by the lacework but the most obvious eye catching attribute of this dress is the color.  Red as roses or rubies, this will certainly make one a head turner if worn. Being a lady in red is no easy feat so we suggest styling this dress exactly the way Rosamund did: with a simple ballerina's bun and  bare collarbones. Since we're not best friends with Riccardo Tisci, head designer of Givenchy, we don't think we'll be getting a custom made Givenchy gown soon.

Critics were shocked when Gone Girl - which made over $300 worldwide - received no awards at the Oscars. Rosamund is pictured at the premiere of Gone Girl (left) and at the Critic Choice's awards (right) in January . Different weights for different scenes . When Amy Dunne runs off in Gone Girl, she packs on a few pounds as part of her disguise, only to return with a killer bob haircut and an even more killer body. The film, which was shot out of sequence, required Rosamund to put on almost a stone and a half (9kg) and shed it over and over again so her body was in synch with her character’s, Healthista reports. It’s an understatement to say that her trainer, Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter Holly Lawson knows a thing or two about training for muscle gain and weight loss, since fighters constantly have to gain or lose weight rapidly to stay in a particular weight class. Rosamund was forced to gain 20 lbs (9kg) in two and a half weeks during Gone Girl, and then lose 15 lbs (6.8kg) in ten days. She put on the weight through lifting heavy weights and then eating carbs to gain fat . In order to lose more than a stone for the final scenes of Gone Girl, Rosamund ate only protein, fat and vegetables, as well as carrying out twice daily plyometrics - resistance moves using body weight . Alkaline water is water with a pH balance of 7 or more - close to the body's natural 7.3-7.4 - and it’s believed to help reduce inflammation . You can buy alkaline drops that make the water more alkaline or add alkalising substances to it such as lemon or baking soda. The natural pH of water depends on where you’re getting it and it tends to range from 6-8.5 pH. Because alkaline water has a higher pH level than plain tap water, proponents say that it can neutralise acid in the bloodstream. This apparently boosts metabolism and helps the body absorb nutrients more effectively, it is claimed. Some even say that alkaline water can help prevent disease and slow the aging process. However, researchers have not verified these claims, say doctors at the Mayo Clinic. Some studies suggests that alkaline water may help slow bone loss, but further investigation is needed to determine if this influences overall bone mineral density and if the benefit is maintained over the long term. This made Lawson the perfect person to train Rosamund and keep her at the appropriate weight for filming. ‘What I did was employ a lot of the stuff I learned from fighting into the training with Rosamund,’ Ms Lawson told Healthista journalist Nicola Dall'Asen. ‘I know how far you can push the body and I knew how to bulk her up with water weight and later strip it out.’ Ms Lawson took Rosamund through four separate training cycles, to gain weight twice and to lose weight twice. The two different goals made for two very different diet and exercise regimes. When Ms Lawson was hired she had a mere two and a half weeks to help Rosamund gain 20lbs (9kg), but made sure that there a solid muscle foundation underneath the weight gain. ‘I put a lot of lean muscle on her, then some fat on top so when she leaned out she looked really good,’ Ms Lawson said. Building muscle . She put on 8lbs (3.6kg) of lean muscle, to be exact. To get there as fast as possible, Ms Lawson had Pike lifting the heaviest weights possible. The workout was a basic weight lifting regime: squats, deadlifts, lunges, curls and other simple moves — but Rosamund was maxing out (that’s lifting as much as is physically possible for you) in eight repetitions. That built a base of muscle that later became the reason for Pike’s incredible definition in the film’s ending scenes. Rosamund is no stranger to weight loss, showcasing her trim body following the  birth of her second son, Atom, in December 2014. She is pictured while pregnant with Atom (left) and after giving birth (right), attending the Golden Globes in Beverly Hills . Rosamund's personal trainer was Holly Lawson, a professional fighter. Ms Lawson is pictured at an awards ceremony in Hollywood, US . Gaining weight for Amy’s chubby scenes . Ms Lawson’s diet for Rosamund’s weight gain cycle included as much ‘good fat’ and protein as she wanted — foods like avocados, almond butter and salmon, and very few carbs. Ms Lawson says these fats are necessary for muscle gain and tone because they ‘feed’ your muscles the proper nutrients to grow. Then, a few days before the filming day, Rosamund was allowed to go crazy with carbs and dense foods to put a layer of fat on top of all the hard work she had just done. So the next time you’re watching the movie and Amy’s looking a little chubbier than before, remember there’s a six pack under there somewhere. Slimming back down for that shower scene . Then, before the famous shower scene she had ten days to lose 15 pounds (6.8 kg) Both the diet and the workout changed completely - with carbs completely banned. ‘That’s when she was really eating like a fighter,’ Ms Lawson said. She compares the diet for the weight loss cycle to the Paleo diet: Rosamund ate three meals a day involving a ton of leafy greens and drank alkaline water like it was nobody’s business. The workout consisted of plyometrics (resistance moves involving jumping using your own body weight) and high intensity cardio (and a whole lot of running). Every day’s plyometrics day was different — some days were just upper body, some just lower body, and some days were full-body workouts. These workouts involved heart-pumping and toning moves like burpees, mountain climbers, and planks, planks, planks. ‘We’d do five million variations of plank all day every day. We’d do groupings of exercises and the last rotation was always a plank,’ she said. In the week leading up to the shower scene, Ms Lawson was training with Rosamund twice a day. The diet and workout regimes sound brutal to say the least. It’s a real testament to how a great attitude can lead you to amazing results. Pike serves as the perfect example. ‘She’s really very all-in with everything she does. Once she’s in, she’s in,’ Ms Lawson said.","Oscar-nominated Rosamund had to undergo 4 intense cycles of weight gain and loss to suit the sequence of filming of Gone Girl .

"About 20 Florida manatees been freed from a storm drain near Cape Canaveral, Florida, where they are believed to have gotten stuck in search of warmer water amid the Florida cold-snap. Rescue workers are continuing the effort to save the seacows today,but the total number of manatees stuck in the culvert is not yet known. Officials said the warmth-loving creatures, which can weigh up to half a ton, were likely following warm freshwater out of frigid seawater into the underground drains when they became stuck. Desperate rescue: Rescuers with SeaWorld and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission brought in earth moving equipment in a desperate bid to pull 17 trapped manatees out of a coastal community's storm culvert . Workers first hauled the endangered mammals out one-by-one before winching them up to ground level, assessing them for injuries and then lowering them back into a nearby waterway . Looking for warmth: The animals were likely trying to find warmth inside the culverts, but did not have room to turn back around, nor can they swim backwards . Video footage show a rescuer comforting one manatee floating at the opening of the pipe, which was cut open during the hours-long rescue. The footage, posted online by Central Florida News 13 and Florida Today newspaper, also showed a manatee being carried in a sling to a nearby canal, where it was released to cheers from onlookers, and two other manatees being petted after being hoisted out of the water by heavy machinery. A team from SeaWorld and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission have been working along with police and firefighters,since yesterday. Inside the culverts, the manatees do not have room to turn back around, nor can they swim backwards. The Sunshine State has experienced a serious cold snap in recent days and temperatures have dropped low enough to threaten the endangered mammals' lives. Rescued: Among the first manatees pulled out were a calf and its mother. Their state of health was not immediately known but they, like all the manatees, were released back into a nearby waterway . After using earth moving equipment to pull out the manatees, a rescue worker assessed each's health before they were lifted once again and placed back in safe waters . Not winter hard: Here, scores of West Indian manatees huddle near a freshwater spring at Three Sisters Springs inside the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge in Crystal River, Fla. The warm-blooded aquatic creatures which live in the shallow confines of the river seek the warmth of the 72-degree spring water when temperatures plummet . 'It's been cold lately and these canals are all filled with manatees,' Satellite Beach Fire Chief Don Hughes said. 'I wouldn't even begin to venture a guess as to how they got into the drainage pipes. They will go wherever there's warm water.' Rescuers brought heavy earth-moving equipment to the Satellite Beach neighborhood, located on a barrier island along the Atlantic Ocean. Workers were expected to be there through the evening as they desperately tried to pull the creatures from what would otherwise become their grave. Among the first of the manatees, also known as sea cows, pulled one-by-one from the drain were a mother and her calf. After using earth moving equipment to pull out the manatees, a rescue worker assessed each's health before they were lifted once again and placed back in safe waters.","At least 17 of the endangered mammals were pulled from a culvert in an Atlantic Coast barrier island community .

"George Zimmerman, the former neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot Trayvon Martin in a 2012 confrontation with the teenager, will not face federal charges, the Justice Department said on Tuesday. The decision, announced in the waning days of Attorney General Eric Holder's tenure, resolves a case that focused on self-defense gun laws and became a flashpoint in the national conversation about race two years before the Ferguson, Missouri, police shooting. Zimmerman has said he acted in self-defense when he shot the 17-year-old Martin during a confrontation inside a gated community in Sanford, Florida, just outside Orlando. Martin, who was black, was unarmed when he was killed. Scroll down for videos . In the clear? George Zimmerman, left, will not federal charges over the 2012 shooting of teenager Trayvon Martin, right, it has been claimed . Once Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder by a state jury in July 2013, Martin's family turned to the federal investigation in hopes that he would be held accountable for the shooting. That probe focused on whether the killing amounted to a federal civil rights violation, which would have required proof that it was motivated by racial animosity. Although Martin's parents have said Zimmerman initiated the fight, the Justice Department said there was not enough evidence to establish that Zimmerman willfully deprived Martin of his civil rights - a difficult legal standard to meet - or killed the teenager on account of his race. This decision is limited strictly to the department's inability to meet the high legal standard required to prosecute the case under the federal civil rights statutes; it does not reflect an assessment of any other aspect of the shooting,' the Justice Department said in a news release announcing the decision Tuesday. Zimmerman's attorney, Don West, was on a flight and couldn't immediately comment on the decision. Martin's parents were too distraught after their meeting in Miami with Justice Department officials to speak with reporters, their attorney Ben Crump said. Protests: Thousands took to the streets across America after Zimmerman was  acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of 17-year-old Martin . The Justice Department's decision not to file federal charges against Zimmerman was expected but still 'a bitter pill to swallow,' he said. 'What they told his family and I was that because Trayvon wasn't able to tell us his version of events, there was a lack of evidence to bring the charges. That's the tragedy,' Crump said. Later the family did release a statement in which they said they were 'disappointed' by the findings. 'Although we are disappointed in these findings, it has steeled our resolve to continue traveling the country with the message of the Trayvon Martin Foundation which is dedicated to protecting our youth and empowering those who demand justice and peace,' said Martin's family in a statement. 'We remain poised to do everything in our power to help eradicate senseless violence in our communities, because we don't want any other parent to experience the unexplainable loss we have endured. 'We will never, ever forget what happened to our son, Trayvon, and will honor his memory by working tirelessly to make the world a better place.' Anger: Demonstrators gather in New York's Time Square to demanded justice a day after Zimmerman was found not guilty . The February 2012 confrontation began after Zimmerman saw Martin while driving in his neighborhood. Zimmerman called police and got out of his car and approached Martin, who was returning from a store while visiting his father and his father's fiancee at the same townhome complex where Zimmerman lived. Zimmerman did not testify at his trial, but he told investigators that he feared for his life as Martin straddled him and punched him during the fight. The decision to not prosecute Zimmerman comes even though Holder has made civil rights a cornerstone of his tenure. The Justice Department is also moving to resolve a separate high-profile civil rights case - the August shooting by a Ferguson police officer of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old. The killing sparked weeks of protests. Days after Zimmerman was acquitted, Holder said he considered Martin's death an 'unnecessary shooting.' In a news release on Tuesday, Holder echoed remarks he made in the shooting's aftermath. 'Though a comprehensive investigation found that the high standard for a federal hate crime prosecution cannot be met under the circumstances here, this young man's premature death necessitates that we continue the dialogue and be unafraid of confronting the issues and tensions his passing brought to the surface,' Holder said. 'We, as a nation, must take concrete steps to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future.' February 26th, 2012 - George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain in Sanford, Florida, calls 911 to make a report of 'a suspicious person'. He is told by officers not to leave his vehicle but disregards this. Moments later residents report hearing a gunshot and police arrive to find Trayvon Martin dead. Zimmerman tells police that he shot Martin in self-defense - is not arrested - and this noted in the police report.

March 13th, 2012 - Sanford Police Department's homicide detective Christopher Serino says that he recommends that Zimmerman be charged with manslaughter.

March 14th, 2012 - The case is turned over to Florida State Attorney Norm Wilfinger . March 15th, 2012 - George Zimmerman's fahter, Robert Zimmerman, writes a letter to the Orlando Sentinel in which he explains that his son is Hispanic and is being erroneously portrayed as a racist.

"Sukvinder Mannan, 32, killed Rebecca McManus, 21 (above), when he lost control of his car . A salesman is facing a 'substantial' prison sentence after admitting killing a talented student when he ploughed his out-of-control car into a bus stop where she was stood waiting with a friend. Sukvinder Mannan, 32, lost control of his powerful Mitsubishi Evo and crashed into Rebecca McManus, 21, and her friend Harriet Barnsley in Smethwick, West Midlands. Miss McManus, who was waiting at the bus stop near Birmingham city centre ahead of a hen party, died at the scene from her injuries. Miss Barnsley, 21, was seriously injured in the crash on May 31 last year. Mannan, from Dudley, West Midlands, admitted causing death by dangerous driving at Wolverhampton Crown Court today and was warned by a judge that he faced a 'very substantial prison sentence'. The sales representative also pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and admitted failing to provide a blood sample following the crash. Before court proceedings started, Judge Andrew Lockhart QC described the case as a tragedy, adding that Miss McManus's family had suffered an enormous loss. The court heard that Mannan had previous convictions from 1999 for driving without insurance and taking a car without consent. After hearing Mannan's guilty plea, Judge Lockhart said: 'He will undoubtedly receive a very substantial prison sentence.' Mannan was handed an interim disqualification from driving and sentencing was adjourned for pre-sentence reports. He was bailed with strict conditions, including surrendering his passport and applying for travel documents. He was also told to live and sleep at his West Midlands address and to report every week to his local police station. Miss McManus had just finished a three-year English Literature and Creative Writing degree at the University of East Anglia (UEA) and was due to graduate just a month after the crash happened. She previously attended St Paul's School for Girls in Edgbaston and studied A-levels at King Edward's in Stourbridge. She had not received all of her grades from her university work but had already received a first class mark in her poetry dissertation and had seen some of her work published. Miss McManus, who was waiting at the bus stop near Birmingham city centre (pictured) ahead of a hen party, died at the scene from her injuries. Her friend, Harriet Barnsley, also 21, was seriously injured in the incident . Her parents Gerard and Catherine McManus, from Oldbury, West Midlands, have previously spoken of their anguish at losing their much-loved daughter. Miss McManus (pictured) was due to graduate just a month after the crash occurred last year . Mrs McManus, 48, said: 'She did not have a bad bone in her body. Everybody loved her and the last three years at university had been the best of her life. 'She was very popular and had kept in touch with everybody from her school days. 'You always worry about your children - but for me it was always about them returning home, rather than on their way to a night out.' Mr McManus added: 'She was such an eccentric character and very individual. 'She always did her own thing and even won a debating contest when she was at school dressed as Phantom of the Opera.' Following her death, tributes from teachers, friends and fellow students described how Miss McManus was an 'irreplaceable loss'. Floral tributes at the scene of the crash described her as 'one of the nicest people I've ever met'. Lynsey Grant, who stopped to help Miss McManus shortly after the crash, left a card to her family, which said: 'We are so sorry for your pain. 'Please know that these young ladies were cared for with urgency and compassion by all at the scene. 'My heart and thoughts are with you.' Tributes left at the scene of the crash after the incident on May 31 last year (above) described Miss McManus as 'one of the nicest people ever'.

"A furious row erupted between the UK and Turkey as it emerged three runaway British teenage girls have reached Syria. Scotland Yard confirmed yesterday that the schoolgirls had crossed the Turkish border into Islamic State territory after flying to Istanbul via Gatwick Airport. Police fear the trio - named as Kadiza Sultana, 16, Amira Abase, 15, and Shamima Begum, 15 - are aiming to reach the terror stronghold of Raqqa where they face being married off to foreign fighters. Scroll down for video . Flight to terror: Clutching their luggage, the three teenage friends prepare to board a flight to Istanbul last week. Police believe they have now been smuggled into Syria . Smugglers in the Turkish border town of Akcakale said they had already crossed the chaotic border using false Syrian IDs and accompanied by a man claiming to be their father. One said: ‘They looked like Syrian girls, they were wearing hijabs and carrying bags from the market. They followed a man who spoke Arabic so everyone thought they were Syrian.' But a row broke out between the UK and Turkey, as the Turkish authorities claimed Scotland Yard had waited three days to tell them about the runaways. In an outspoken attack, Turkey’s deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc pinned the blame on UK police and accused them of allowing the girls to flee Britain. Lured to jihad: Kadiza Sultana, 16, left, Shamima Begum, 15, centre, and Amira Abase, 15, right, at Gatwick Airport. There are fears they are to be married off as 'jihadi brides' to Islamic State terrorists . ‘It is a reprehensible act for Britain, a country famous for its Scotland Yard, to let the three girls...leave (London) for Istanbul and then let us know three days later,’ he said. ‘They haven’t taken the necessary measures. The search is ongoing. It would be great if we can find them. But if we can’t, it is not us who will be responsible, but the British.’ Mr Arinc said the girls had posed as tourists so there was no way of knowing their intentions. But Scotland Yard hit back, saying that its officers began working with Turkish authorities the day after the first two teenagers were reported missing last Tuesday. A spokesman said: ‘Once we established that the girls had travelled to Turkey, police made contact with the foreign liaison officer at the Turkish Embassy in London on Wednesday, 18 February. 'Since then we have been working closely with the Turkish authorities who are providing great assistance and support to our investigation.’ Scotland Yard confirmed that the girls were now in Syria. In a statement, the force said: ‘Officers from the MPS counter-terrorism command, leading the investigation into the three missing schoolgirls from east London, now have reason to believe that they are no longer in Turkey and have crossed into Syria. Route to hell: The three teenagers are believed to have travelled over ground from Istanbul to Gaizantep, before crossing the border into Syria near the Kilis crossing . Turkey has repeatedly been accused by its Western allies of failing to do enough to stop jihadis on their way to Syria. Mr Arinc’s complaints echo remarks made by Turkish officials after Hayat Boumeddiene, the wanted partner of one of the gunmen behind the January terror attacks in France, travelled undetected through Turkey on her way to Syria. Security officials say 3,400 foreign fighters, including at least 500 Britons, have travelled from Europe to Syria to fight, often via Turkey. Experts estimate about 50 are women. 'Groomed': Shamima Begum (right) is thought to have been contacted directly using Twitter by a female IS fighter. She later flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey with friends Kadiza Sultana, left, 16, and Amira Abase . The trio, who all attended Bethnal Green Academy in east London, were described as 'straight-A students'. It was revealed last week that the three were interviewed by police just two months ago, amid fears they were being radicalised. Detectives spoke to the teens after one of their classmates left for the war zone as they believed they were being encouraged to leave their homes. The schoolgirls are feared to have fled to Syria to become jihadi brides after being ruthlessly groomed online and 'brainwashed in their bedrooms'. They walked out of their homes last Tuesday before strolling through security checks at Gatwick Airport and flying to Turkey. Police said their families, who have issued urgent appeals for their daughters to return, have been surprised and devastated by their disappearance. The news comes after Prime Minister David Cameron urged airlines and internet companies to do more to prevent radicalised British teenagers travelling to the Middle East. Earlier, the girls' headteacher said he was 'shocked and saddened' by their disappearance, but said police had not found evidence that they were radicalised at school. Mark Keary, principal of Bethnal Green Academy in east London, said police spoke to the girls after another student disappeared in December and indicated at the time that there was no evidence that they were at risk of being radicalised or absconding. He also said access to social media at the school was 'strictly regulated'. A tweet sent from a Twitter account under Shamima's name was sent to Aqsa Mahmood, who left Glasgow for Syria to be a 'jihadi bride' in 2013. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'We work very closely with the Turkish authorities on a whole series of security measures. We are going to continue to do so. 'It is a good, strong, constructive relationship. We are working with them on this case. 'We are going to keep working very closely with the Turkish authorities on what is a shared challenge.'","Teenagers are now believed to have crossed Turkish border into Syria .

"When a fine art photographer and her boyfriend realised that their beloved American Staffordshire Terrier, Mr Dukes, was in his final stages of cancer, they decided to take him to the beach. The 11-year-old pooch loved swimming in the family pool and they didn't want him to die before he'd seen the ocean. Owner Zhenia Bulawka documented the trip to the seaside in Assateague, Maryland, with a series of moving photographs that she posted on a blog. Ms Bulawka described Mr Dukes (pictured) as her 'best friend and muse' who she 'could never tire of photographing' 'People watching': Ms Bulawka's post tugged on the heartstrings of hundreds who'd read it, with many posting messages of support and admiration . 'Ruby was the first to be let off her leash,' wrote Ms Bulawka. 'She entered the water all on her own - proud mama moment. Except she bolted off, heading for shore upon hearing the sounds of the first crashing wave. It's okay… she got back in' Ms Bulawka wrote that when they arrived 'clouds quickly rolled in, and it started to drizzle... Who cares though? We love the rain!' They feature the entire family - Ms Bulawka herself, boyfriend Christian, Mr Dukes and the couple's other two dogs Ruby and Violet - and hundreds of people have commented on just how touching the images are. Ms Bulawka wrote on her blog post: 'My boyfriend Christian, and I took our three pups on an overnight stay at the beach. We dedicated the trip to our 11-year-old American Staffordshire Terrier, Dyuki (Mr Dukes). He was in his final stages of Grade III mast cell cancer at the time. His most favorite activity was swimming in our family pool, but until then, he had never seen the ocean. It was a very special trip for us, and I'm so grateful we were able to make it happen. He passed away a month later, but he put up one hell of a fight - almost two years.' Of that poignant day at the beach, she said: ‘We were the only ones around, so Ruby was the first to be let off her leash. She entered the water all on her own - proud mama moment. Except she bolted off, heading for shore upon hearing the sounds of the first crashing wave. It's okay… she got back in.'

Ms Sunter has now fled the £360-a-month property as a result of the abuse and has been staying with her mother. She is now waiting to move into another new home. Today, West Midlands Police said they had arrested a 54-year-old man in connection with the attacks. He is understood to be white. A force spokesman said: 'A 54-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated criminal damage and was later released on police bail pending further inquiries.' The man, who has not been named has been told to return to a police station in April. Shortly after the incident, West Midlands Police had said the incident was being taken 'very seriously'. Housing association Whitefriars, which owns the flat, has confirmed there has also been a 'previous incident' at the address. Speaking last week, Ms Sunter said she has lived in Willenhall for 15 years and has never experienced anything like this before. 'These people make Willenhall out to be some sort of ghetto,' she said. 'The whole point of this is that it's not right. I'm not going to sit there and take it.

"The family of an unarmed Mexican man who was shot dead by police has hired the lawyer representing the families of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin. Relatives of Antonio Zambrano-Montes have called on the services of Benjamin Crump, a civil rights attorney, saying they want justice after he was killed while running away from officers earlier this month in Pasco, Washington state. The death has sparked two weeks of protests in the city along the Columbia River in the south eastern part of the state after video emerged showing the moment he was shot. Scroll down for video . Lawyer Benjamin Crump stands alongside Antonio Zambrano-Montes' mother and sister and their interpreter outside a funeral home in Washington state where his body is being kept . Mr Crump comforts the victim's mother after revealing that she fainted upon seeing her son's dead body . Erika Zambrano holds a photo of of her father Mr Zambrano-Montes on  while standing outside the city hall building in Pasco, Washington . Yesterday, Mr Crump revealed that Mr Zambrano-Montes' mother, Agaptia Montes-Rivera fainted when he accompanied her to see her son's body. She told reporters through an interpreter, before entering the funeral home: 'I want people to understand my pain. 'It's really hard... When I saw the video, I felt really bad. That's why I asked for justice.' Authorities say Mr Zambrano-Montes, a 35-year-old Mexican immigrant and former orchard worker, was throwing rocks at officers and a stun gun failed to subdue him. The Franklin County coroner has ordered an inquest into the death, which is being reviewed by a regional task force and the investigation is being monitored by federal authorities. In a video recording by Dario Infante Zuniga, five 'pops' are audible and Mr Zambrano-Montes can be seen running away, pursued by three officers. Mr Zambrano-Montes, 35, is captured on witness Dario Infante's cellphone just seconds before he is shot dead by police. He appears to be running away from officers . The orchard worker, who was born in Mexico, had allegedly been throwing rocks at police. He is pictured turning to face three armed officers as one holds up a flashlight and two others draw their guns . Mr Zambrano-Montes is seen lying on the ground after he was shot by police at the busy intersection . As the officers draw closer, he turns to face them and more 'pops' are heard before he falls to the ground. The killing was the fourth by Pasco police in less than a year. Officers were exonerated after similar investigations in the first three cases. Mr Crump says that Mr Zambrano-Montes spoke no English and was an immigrant living in the country illegally. He added: 'Zambrano-Montes had his hands up. Why did you have to shoot him? 'All the young people are protesting that Antonio had his hands up based on what they saw in the video, and he had no weapons. 'And just like in New York, it shows the graphic last moments of Eric Garner's life, here you have a video that shows the graphic last moments of Antonio's life.' But police said officers felt threatened and that Mr Zambrano-Montes was arrested last year for assault after throwing objects at Pasco officers and trying to grab an officer's pistol, court records show. The death has sparked two weeks of protests in the city along the Columbia River in the south eastern part of the state . Protesters at a rally for Mr Zambrano-Montes earlier this month.

Last week, investigators asked for patience as the investigation continues. Meanwhile, another attorney who says he's representing Zambrano-Montes' family says he wants to temporarily withdraw a $25 million claim filed his widow and two daughters against the city after the shooting.

"Beard-wearing militants belonging to West Africa's brutal Boko Haram Islamic terror organisation have been dressing as women in a hopeless attempt at avoiding the attention of security officials. Nigerian defense forces liberating the town of Baga from jihadi control yesterday set up a cordon around the suburbs to help them catch any Boko Haram militants who had been unable to escape. The security workers were shocked to come across several fleeing fighters trying to pass themselves off as females by putting on layers of colourful women's clothing - despite the fact they had refused to shave their thick jihadi beards. Hopeless: Security workers discovered several fleeing Boko Haram militants trying to pass themselves off as women by wearing female clothing - despite the fact they had refused to shave their thick jihadi beards .

The vehicle carries the chilling black and white emblem also used by the Islamic State terrorist group . The terrorists' attempts to pass themselves off as women were disclosed by Nigerian defense forces yesterday, following a huge operation to flush the militants out the town of Baga. A statement signed by Major General Chris Olukolade said, 'The searches are also yielding more discoveries of arms especially bombs hidden in various locations, especially Baga town' local media outlet Vanguard reported. 'Apart from those captured in the course of fighting, many arrests of terrorists hiding in the town are being made and troops are still busy interrogating the suspects. 'Meanwhile, in furtherance of the mission to clear terrorists from all their enclaves by the military, the Nigerian Air Force has stepped up its air bombardment of identified targets in Gwoza, Bama and Sambisa forest, preparatory to other phases of the mission. 'The air strikes have been highly successful as they achieved the aims, hitting vital targets with required precision. Terrorists are now in disarray as they scamper to escape from the impact of air bombardment of their locations in the forest. Blaze: A military vehicle used by Boko Haram is set on fire by Nigerian troops near the town of Baga . Battle: Nigeria's military said  that the offensive against Boko Haram is progressing, claiming soldiers had recovered stocks of arms abandoned by insurgents fleeing the recaptured town . Firepower: A handout photo released by the Nigerian Army  claims to show stocks of arms abandoned by fleeing Boko Haram insurgents recovered by Nigerian troops near the town of Baga . The news came as girl as young as seven blew herself up in a busy market in northeastern Nigeria, killing herself and four others, and fueling fears Islamic extremists are using kidnapped girls as suicide bombers. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday's attack, which also seriously wounded 46 people, but it bore the hallmarks of Nigeria's homegrown extremist group, Boko Haram. The girl, who appeared to be no more than seven years old, got out of a tricycle taxi in front of the busy cell phone market in Potiskum and minutes later her explosives detonated, according to Anazumi Saleh, a survivor of the attack who suffered head injuries. Authorities were not immediately able to confirm the girl's identity or her precise age from her remains. In recent months, Boko Haram has begun using teenage girls and young women for suicide bombings in marketplaces, bus stations and other busy areas, but the girl in Sunday's attack appeared far younger. It is not clear whether the girls and women have set off the explosions themselves, or whether the detonations were controlled remotely.

A vehicle used by Boko Haram is pictured after being destroyed by Nigerian troops near the town of Baga . Motorcycles used by Boko Haram is pictured after being destroyed by Nigerian troops near the town of Baga . Boko Haram, whose name means 'Western education is sinful' in the local Hausa language, attracted international condemnation when its fighters kidnapped 276 mostly Christian schoolgirls from a boarding school in the northeastern town of Chibok in April. Dozens escaped but 219 remain missing. Boko Haram has said the girls have converted to Islam and been married off to extremist fighters. Boko Haram's violent campaign in Nigeria killed at least 10,000 people last year, according to the Council on Foreign Affairs. At least 1.6 million people have been driven from their homes in the group's brutal five-year uprising to create an Islamic state in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation of 160 million people divided between mainly Muslims in the north and Christians in the south. Potiskum, the capital of Yobe state, has been the target of repeated attacks. In November, a suicide bomber disguised in a school uniform set off explosives hidden in a backpack during an assembly at a high school, killing at least 48 students and wounding 79 others. The group has indicated it may soon join up with the Islamic State group, according to a message posted Sunday on Twitter. Boko Haram began emulating the Islamic State group last August, declaring it had established an Islamic caliphate in territory it controls in northeastern Nigeria. 'We give you glad tidings that the group's Shurah Council is at the stage of consulting and studying, and we will let you know soon the group's decision in respect to pledging allegiance to the caliph of the Muslims, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,' the group said in the message, referring to the ISIS leader.","Militants in the town of Baga in Nigeria tried to claim they were females .

"Britain's armed forces are 'not good enough' to deal with the global Islamist terror threat, the former head of the military Lord Richards said tonight. In his maiden speech in the House of Lords the new peer questioned if the military was in a 'fit state' to protect our 'way of life' from extremists. Lord Richards – who as General Sir David Richards was chief of the defence staff for just under three years from October 2010 – said that the 'biggest threat confronting the free world today is that posed in my judgement by militant jihadism'. Former head of the military, Lord Richards - formerly General Sir David Richards - warned peers that Britain's armed forces may not be 'good enough' to tackle Islamic extremism . But he said: 'Are our armed forces in a fit state to play their role in dealing with these and other risks to our way of life? 'Well, my Lords, the answer must be that it is not good enough but it is some consolation that it is better than any other allied nation except the United States.' He warned that it was not just Iraq and Syria that were threatened by Islamic terrorists. He said: 'All states are equally vulnerable, including many great Muslim nations. Lord Richards used his maiden speech in the House of Lords to call for increase defence spending . 'Rather than bickering, states should cohere to confront this threat through the adoption of a multi-dimensional strategy in which all can play a constructive part. 'This struggle will be generational and our leaders must stop seeking short term tactical solutions.' Lord Richards called for defence spending to be increased as the economy improves. He said: 'As the economy grows, routine defence spending post 2015 must increase, as a minimum, to 2 per cent of GDP. 'If not, given the mathematics that seems stubbornly to govern defence expenditure, the size and effectiveness of the armed forces will inevitably deteriorate.' Lord Richards also warned about the plans to replace thousands of regular soliders with part-time reservists. He said that the brave experiment over the Army Reserve must either soon be proved to work or a new solution found. 'Any additional money spent on this must not be taken from other programmes, merely robbing Peter to pay Paul.'","Peer used maiden speech in the Lords to call for higher defence spending .

"Two thirds of Australia's 2.7 million smokers are likely to die ten years earlier due to their habit, a new study has revealed. However smokers who quit by the age of 45 wipe away most of their increased death risk, the first large-scale, direct evidence on smoking and mortality in Australia has shown. Researchers from Sydney's Sax Institute followed 200,000 Australians aged 45 and over for four years, finding death rates among smokers were about three times higher than in non-smokers. Scroll down for video . A four year study by the Sax Institute has found that two thirds of Australia's 2.7 million smokers are likely to die ten years earlier due to their habit . Those who smoked 10-a-day were about twice as likely to die early, while a habit of 25-a-day raised the risk by up to fivefold. 'If you are smoking, the chances are it will kill you if you keep on going,' said lead author Professor Emily Banks of Sydney's Sax Institute and the Australian National University. 'If you are a gambler, it's not a very good bet. The good news is that if you quit the benefits are clear and lasting.' The 45 and Up Study, published in the journal BMC Medicine on Tuesday, is the best large-scale evidence on smoking and death in Australia and confirms recent findings from studies in both the U.S. and the UK, Prof Banks says. Those who smoked 10-a-day were about twice as likely to die early, while a habit of 25-a-day raised the risk by up to fivefold . 'It is a huge wake-up call for Australia. We know smoking is the cause of a wide range of diseases but we now have direct evidence from Australia that shows just how hazardous it is. Even ten cigarettes a day will double your risk of dying prematurely. Smokers greatly underestimate or do not understand the seriousness of these risks,' Professor Banks said. Laureate Professor Alan Lopez, one of the study authors and the director of the Global Burden of Disease Group, praised Australia's tobacco control measures - including heightening prices - which he said have brought smoking rates down to 12.8 per cent - the lowest in the Western world. But he said the results were a reminder that there was no safe level of smoking. Researchers f followed 200,000 Australians aged 45 and over for four years, finding death rates among smokers were about three times higher than in non-smokers . 'While Australia is a world leader in tobacco control, the battle to reduce the public health consequences of tobacco use is far from over… While this is gratifying, it is still 13 percent too many; 2.7 million Australians still smoke,' Professor Lopez said. 'Our findings revealed that up to two in every three Australians who smoke can be expected to die from their habit if they don't quit. Their risk of dropping dead at any age is three times that of non-smokers,' he said. 'These are enormous risks and highlight the importance of government staying the course on tobacco control. Local tobacco control policy ought to be more responsive to this new and compelling local evidence,' he said.","Two thirds of Australia's 2.7m smokers are likely to die 10 years earlier .

"Two-tiered system: Patrons could soon pay up to $1 for a 'regular' letter and up to $2 for a 'priority' letter . Australia Post is set to drastically increase the cost of postage stamps by 40 cents to $1 - and if you want the parcel to be delivered the next day you'll be forced to pay $2. The national mail service will hike prices as part of a new two-tiered system, with the 'regular' letter service costing $1 instead of 60 cents. Those letters will arrive later than the $2 'priority' service, which means you have to pay a full dollar more for high-priority correspondence. It comes after Australia Post announced a shocking half-year loss of $151 million, a drop of 56 per cent. The Abbott government is getting ready to soften the regulations that govern Australia Post in order for this two-tiered process to be functional. This reform would see that pensioners and concession card holders would continue to pay the standard 60c. Australia Post CEO Ahmed Fahour says reform - such as introducing a two-tiered pricing for its letters - is vital. The government is expected to announce its support of the motion in coming weeks. During last weeks ABC Television's Q&A program, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull said politicians need to move beyond slogans and do a better jobs at explaining complex reforms such as this one. Mr Turnbull then interviewed the Managing Director of the Boston Consulting Group, Nick Glenning, for his own YouTube channel. Scroll down for video . Looking at a loss: If Australia Post does not act, it is expected they will lose $10 billion in the coming years . The interview was uploaded to YouTube on the same day as Australia Post announced a further steep drop-off in residential mail volumes, and asked the government to support a delivery overhaul, calling the letter results 'not pretty'. 'While Australia Post as a whole has still made a profit... the growing letters loss is being subsidised, or covered by, the profit in parcels and retail,' Glenning said. 'That's not going to last for much longer and without change the company is heading for an overall loss.' Malcolm Turnbull (right) interviews BCG Director Nick Glenning (left) for his YouTube 'Tech Talk: Reforming Australia Post' Turnbull quizzed Glenning on the increasing of stamp costs and reducing the frequency of delivery runs to cut costs in overseas postal services who have faced the same collapse. 'The parcel market is growing, particularly where people can order things from retail eCommerce,' Glenning said. 'However, it is a highly competitive and capital intensive business.' Turnbull reaffirmed Glenning's points by stating that Australia's parcel business is benefiting from the eCommerce boom, but the parcel business is competitive and letters is a monopoly. Glenning went on to say that big players are appearing in the market with services like Japan Post and Singapore Post investing several hundred million dollars every few years to maintain a competitive position. Pensioners and concession card holders will continue to pay the standard 60c under the new reform . On being asked how much money Australia Post would lose if they did not act, Glenning told Turnbull it was an estimated $10 billion in the letters business overall with the losses getting bigger and bigger. Malcolm Turnbull's 'Tech Talk: Reforming Australia Post' has attracted over 300 views since Monday. Australia Post is to face a grilling in a senate estimates hearing in Canberra on Tuesday. The Communications Electrical Plumbing Union has said it would support sensible reforms on the condition that it's upfront with its staff and customers.","New two-tier 'priority' and 'regular' letter service could be introduced .

"Rats have always been blamed for causing bubonic plague outbreaks in Europe, but now researchers claim they’ve been unfairly maligned and that it was actually gerbils that caused repeated epidemics of the disease. The revelation comes from University of Oslo researchers who say they have compelling evidence that outbreaks of the plague, which killed millions in Europe after it arrived in the 14th century, can be traced back to great gerbils (Rhombomys opimus) from central Asia. They say that the plague-carrying fleas flourished on the rodents before making their way to Europe via the Silk Road trading route. Rat's amazing: University of Oslo researchers say they have compelling evidence that outbreaks of the plague can be traced back to great gerbils (pictured) from central Asia . Study co-author Christian Stenseth told the BBC: ‘If we're right, we'll have to rewrite that part of history.’ Professor Stenseth and his team drew their conclusion after using tree-ring data to establish medieval weather patterns and compared these with thousands of black death records. They found that ideal weather patterns for the spread of the plague didn’t come from Europe, but Asia. Fifteen years after a warm weather spell in Central Asia, a plague outbreak would occur in Europe. This pattern continued for hundreds of years. Professor Stenseth said: ‘We show that wherever there were good conditions for gerbils and fleas in central Asia, some years later the bacteria shows up in harbour cities in Europe and then spreads across the continent.’ Gerbils numbers would increase, he said, whenever a hot summer followed a wet spring. He added: ‘Such conditions are good for gerbils. It means a high gerbil population across huge areas and that is good for the plague. An increase in temperature of one degree will double the prevalence of plague in the gerbil population.’ The bubonic plague remains one of the most destructive pandemics in history which peaked in Europe between 1348 and 1350 . Humans caught the plague from rats, but researchers say it was actually gerbils that were the original breeding ground for the disease . The fleas made their way to Europe in various stages. Some would have arrived via foxes that had eaten the gerbils, which then passed them onto rats, which passed them to humans. In other cases humans may have caught the disease from camels, the fleas having jumped to them from the gerbils. Filthy living conditions in 14th Britain have been blamed for allowing the Black Death to spread. It remains one of the most destructive pandemics in history which peaked in Europe between 1348 and 1350. Experts say it reduced the world's population from an estimated 450 million to almost 350 million in 1400. In 1603 the killer plague returned and killed 38,000 Londoners. The symptoms of the Black Death were revolting with historians noting descriptions of fever, muscle spasms, coughing up blood and black blood oozing out of swelling lymph nodes. The most commonly noted symptom was the appearance of swollen lymph nodes on the groin, the neck and armpits, which often wept with pus and blood when they burst. Professor Stenseth’s study results appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

He is among thousands of injured former servicemen and women forced to pay for social care because they were injured on or before April 5, 2005. Veterans on the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme, which was introduced for those injured after April 6, 2005, do not have to pay towards their care. The Royal British Legion is campaigning for an end to the 'profoundly unfair' system, and is calling on the Government to set aside funding so all injured veterans receive the social care they need. Mr Cannon, of the 2nd Battalion, Essex Regiment, was seriously injured when he and his company came under Panzer attack two weeks into the Allied assault on occupied France after the Normandy landings. He was left lying where he was until eventually being picked up by an Allied tank two days later – and was the only member of his platoon to return home alive. The injury left him with one leg shorter than the other, which has affected his mobility. Twenty years ago, he was assessed as being 50 per cent disabled as a result of his service and was awarded a war pension as compensation. The pension is now worth £105 per week, plus a £54 mobility supplement. Outraged: Mr Cannon's family, pictured together on his 90th birthday, are campaigning for a rule change so free care applies to all injured soldiers, not just those hurt after 2005 . Under current rules, veterans injured before April 6, 2005, must hand over most of their weekly war pension payments should they need social care. This applies to veterans of the Second World War, Korea, the Falklands, Northern Ireland and the first Iraq War. It is possible for councils to exempt the war pension from means testing for care costs – but only 12 per cent of authorities do so. Servicemen wounded after April 2005 are entitled to keep all their payments because they are paid out of a different scheme – the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme. Councils are instructed to fully exempt payments made under this programme from any means testing for social care. Veterans injured in service on or before April 2005 receive a War Disablement Pension and are known as War Pensioners. An estimated 4,000 injured former servicemen and women across the UK are currently being forced to use war pensions to pay carers. The Royal British Legion said some veterans are so concerned at losing their pensions if they need care they have considered moving to areas which will not take it. The Department of Health is looking at the policy and how it should be applied in the future. The former caretaker then moved into a nursing home in Dartford, Kent after a series of falls. However his family and the British Legion say the council takes all but £10 of the £105 to pay for the nursing home costs. He keeps the mobility payout and the council also leaves him £24.50 a week personal spending allowance, which comes from his other pensions. Daughter-in-law Linda Cannon, 55, a primary school teacher from Dartford, said: 'I understand care needs to be paid for but the war pension is something we feel is compensation for how he suffered while fighting for our country. 'Although his heating and food is paid for at the home the extra money could be put towards him coming home for Sunday lunch in a taxi which caters to wheelchairs... [or] a specially adapted hotel for our yearly holiday to the Isle of Wight. He deserves one holiday a year while he still can.' Mr Cannon's wife Lillian, a switchboard worker at an insurance company, died of cancer in 1996 at the age of 65. But his sons Paul, 58, a teacher, and Brian, 62, who is in insurance, are also angry about the money. British Legion director general Chris Simpkins said: 'Not only is it unfair that war pensioners such as Mr Cannon are treated less favourably than a veteran injured at a later date, but it's also unfair that their compensation is seen as normal income in means tests for care.' Hero: Mr Cannon was part of the force that stormed Gold beach in 1944, pictured, but was shot and injured and left for two days surrounded by his dead platoon until he was rescued . Last night MPs and other veterans' campaigners also called for an end to the loophole. MP John Woodcock, a member of the defence select committee, said: 'We owe our lives and our freedom to men like Fred Cannon, and the nation must show it values that while the D-Day veterans are still with us.' Falklands veteran Simon Weston said: 'The importance of people serving their country didn't begin in 2005. Everyone is entitled to fair play but the older generation of veterans is not getting that – they are being discriminated against.' Brigadier (Ret'd) Robin Bacon, from The Soldiers' Charity, said: 'The Government has recognised that injured veterans will sometimes need a lifetime of care, and this should extend to protecting their war pensions.' A Kent County Council spokesman said: 'We follow Government guidance when assessing people who receive war pensions and need social care. This includes the ability to exercise discretion based on individual circumstances. 'While we cannot comment in detail on Mr Fred Cannon's circumstances, following representation by his family the council has exercised significant discretion in his case, with effect from January 2014. 'The claim that he is left with just £10 a week from his war pension is incorrect.' A Government spokesman said: 'As part of the Armed Forces Covenant, this Government has committed to ensuring veterans get special treatment and are not disadvantaged by their service. We have been working with the British Legion to see how we can support all veterans.' Kent County Council employs 21 senior managers earning more than £100,000 but does not cover the care costs of injured veterans like Fred Cannon. Andrew Ireland, below right, the council's head of adult social care, the department raiding Mr Cannon's war pension, earns £178,166-a-year plus expenses. The highest paid member of staff is David Cockburn, corporate director of strategic and corporate services, who is paid £189,575 by the taxpayer. The council was heavily criticised when its former chief executive Katherine Kerswell, below left, walked away with the £420,000 pay-off after just 20 months in charge. She left after axing 1,000 jobs at a cost of almost £11million. The council's accounts revealed she had received a final year package of £589,165, including a £420,000 pay-off, £139,806 in salary and a £29,359 pension contribution. Within months she was made the Cabinet Office's director-general for civil service reform on a salary of £142,000 a year – just £500 less than the Prime Minister.","Fred Cannon, says it 'stinks' that £95 of his £105 weekly pension is taken .

"A single mum successfully juggles the contrasting worlds of caring for her daughter and writing gay erotic fiction. Not only did Toni Griffin hate English when she was at school but she had never even considered writing a book until an idea popped into her head on the way to pick up her daughter from school about five years ago. An avid reader, the Darwin resident went home and instead of picking up a book, she opened her laptop to see if she was capable of writing a book which was when her love of writing gay erotic fiction was born.

Not only did Griffin hate English when she was at school but she had never even considered writing a book until an idea popped into her head on the way to pick up her daughter from school about five years ago . The 32-year-old, who released her 20th book on Valentines day, has always been into reading straight erotic fiction and one day decided to give gay erotic fiction a go. 'I really enjoyed the story and have never looked back since,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Surprisingly, many women feel the same way as at least two thirds of Griffin's fan base are in fact females. 'I find it difficult to explain what the attraction is - it's just something that is for me,' she said. 'Maybe it's the naughty aspect or just being able to escape the pressure of their lives into a little fantasy world.' Griffin makes a point of keeping her career as separate as possible from her 11-year-old daughter, Adara. 'I like to spend as much time as I can possibly can with her so when she goes to bed - the laptop comes out,' she said. 'She knows she isn't allowed to read them until she is 18 but I'm not sure she knows the full extent of the content in the books. 'So she doesn't really ask any questions but she's proud of what I do.' Griffin makes a point of keeping her career as separate as possible from her daughter . Griffin can't imagine ever writing anything other than gay erotic fiction novels . Griffin said she has only ever received positive feedback in the correspondence she receives from readers. 'When I tell some people what I do they often get a stunned look on their face but then ask lots of questions - while others think it's incredible and have a bit of a chuckle then also start asking questions,' she said. It's not just humans who feature in Griffin's books with story lines including werewolves, hellhounds and vampire characters  - and even a necromancer series set in and around Darwin. But Griffin doesn't expect to have any of her series of books to be the next Twilight series or even 50 Shade of Grey. 'I think there is much better writing out there before they would even thinking about mine,' she says modestly. Griffin can't imagine ever writing anything but gay erotic fiction novels. 'My parents and lot of other people ask if I would ever write straight erotic fiction but I don't know if I even want to try to be honest - it doesn't draw me in as much.' Griffin's daughter knows she isn't allowed to read her mum's books until she is 18-years-old . Griffin says straight erotic fiction does not draw her in the way that gay erotica novels do .","Single mum of one writes gay erotic fiction and most fans are female .

"Terry Brown claims he was attacked and hounded out of his home by a vigilante mob after spending a year on bail falsely accused of rape . A man was stabbed and attacked by a mob when he was wrongly accused of rape, and claims his partner suffered a miscarriage after a gang hounded the couple over the false allegations. Terry Brown, 33, was forced to flee his home town of Basildon in Essex after Lisa-Jayne Samuels falsely claimed he had drugged and raped her, and even picked him out of an ID parade. Samuels - who had made up the lies to get attention from her mother - was jailed for 20 months after she admitted perverting the course of justice but Mr Brown claims he was made a prisoner in his own home while he spent a year on bail for the false allegations. In one incident Mr Brown and his partner, Tracey Choularton, 25, were surrounded by a gang as they left their home and as Ms Choularton tried to flee she tripped and fell. She later suffered a miscarriage. Mr Brown was frequently targeted by angry mobs and the home he shared with his partner was daubed with graffiti on a daily basis, branding him 'scum' and a 'rapist.' 'We had to barricade ourselves into the house as we were terrified,' said Mr Brown, speaking after Samuels, a mother-of-four, was jailed for the lies. 'I walked outside my house once and a group of lads just jumped me and started hitting me with fence panels that had nails sticking out. 'I was left with puncture wounds in my back and they smashed out my teeth. Eventually we had to leave Basildon as I just didn't feel safe there. 'Everyone had branded me a rapist because I had been arrested so they decided I must be guilty.' Mr Brown now lives on Canvey Island, Essex, with Ms Choularton, 25. 'I've never been the same since really - I still have nightmares and can't go back to Basildon even though it's my home town as I just don't feel safe, he added. 'I'm on anti-depressants and I haven't worked since this all started. 'I'm a plasterer by trade but just can't do it anymore as I am constantly shaking.' In one incident Ms Choularton said the couple were surrounded by a gang of 20 people near their home in Basildon, who were accusing Mr Brown of raping Samuels. Mr Brown and his partner Tracey Choularton claim they were surrounded by a gang who confronted him over the fake rape claims, and Ms Choularton fell over as she fled the group. She later suffered a miscarriage . She said: 'We were just walking down the road one morning in Basildon and a gang of around 20 people just came out of nowhere. 'I tried to run but tripped on a curb. 'We managed to get back to the house but I was bleeding a lot. 'We couldn't call an ambulance as the house was surrounded so we had to wait for them to leave before we could. 'Because of her allegations I lost my baby. I just wish she understood the pain and upset her actions have caused. Terry still blames himself for the loss of our baby which is awful for him.' Samuels was jailed for 20 months when she appeared at Basildon Crown Court on Friday. It emerged that the 29-year-old had falsely cried rape twice before. The court heard that she had police draw up an e-fit based on her bogus claims and had picked Mr Brown out of an ID parade. Lisa-Jayne Samuels (left) was jailed for 20 months after she admitted making the false rape claim against Mr Brown (right) in a bid to get her mother's sympathy, and pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice . Her false claims saw 80 hours of police time wasted during the investigation. Samuels, of Southend, Essex, called 999 at 1am on October 10, 2012, claiming to have been raped at the town's cliffs. She told police her drink had been spiked by her attacker, who she knew from a shelter. Eventually when CCTV showed no evidence of her being in the pub she claimed and her friends proved fictitious she admitted lying - after Mr Brown had already spent a year on bail. Recorder Anthony Abell said: 'The consequences for Mr Brown have been catastrophic. 'He has had 'dirty scummy rapist' graffitied on his home, been attacked by a gang of thugs with a large piece of wood so that he could not speak for a couple of days and he blames himself for the loss of a child. 'He was prevented from seeing his two elder children and got so scared he sought help to move away from the area.' Samuels was jailed and all her children were taken into care.","Terry Brown accused of rape after Lisa-Jayne Samuels made false claim .

"America's favourite chocolate bar – the Hershey bar – is to go GM-free amid growing concerns in the US about ‘Frankenstein food’. The firm has announced that it will no longer use genetically modified sugar beet or soya lecithin in its milk chocolate bars and packs of chocolate drop ‘Kisses’. The issue has come to a head in America because of efforts to introduce a law requiring firms to label the use of GM ingredients – as happens in Britain and Europe. Going GM-free: Chocolate brand Hershey is caving into consumer pressure by dropping genetically modified products - including GM sugar beet and soya lecithin - from the recipe of its bars and chocolate drops . The State of Vermont has voted for GM labelling to come into effect in 2016 and it seems likely to trigger a domino effect with others expected to follow suit. Once some states require the labelling of GM ingredients like sugar, corn and soya, national food chains will have little option but to adopt the policy across North America. GM crops like sugar beet, corn or maize and soya have been at the centre of concerns that the associated industrial farming practices have caused serious harm to the environment. The plants have been altered through the insertion of foreign genes that create toxins to kill insects or give them immunity to spraying with powerful chemical weed killers. There is evidence from the US that certain weeds have developed immunity to the same weed killers with the result that they are taking over many fields. At the same time, the use of sprays alongside the GM crops is thought to have caused a collapse in the population of the Monarch butterfly, which is now under threat. Last year, Tesco was criticised for selling a number of American products, including Hershey bars, Oreo Mint Cream biscuits, and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups containing GM ingredients. The use of GM ingredients has to be included on the labels of the products sold in the UK, however – currently – it is not required on the other side of the Atlantic. The campaigning group, Green America, welcomed the decision by Hershey as an ‘important move and great first step’. Its Campaigns Director, Nicole McCann, said: ‘As one of the leading chocolate companies in the US, this commitment will help move the rest of the companies in this sector. ‘Hershey’s joins General Mills, Unilever, Post Foods, and other leading companies in responding to consumer demand to make at least some of its products non-GM.’ The GMO Inside group has led a consumer campaign to put pressure on food giants to stop using GM ingredients. Its co-chairman, John Roulac, said:’ ‘Hershey’s needs to take the next step and go non-GMO with all of its chocolates, and get third-party verification for non-GMO ingredients.’ Biohazard: GM crops like sugar beet, corn or maize and soya have been at the centre of concerns that the associated industrial farming practices have caused serious harm to the environment . Hershey’s said its change to the products is part of a wider initiative to simplify ingredients used in its products and remove artificial additives. For Hershey’s Milk Chocolate and Kisses, the company will move to natural vanilla, nongenetically modified sugar and milk from cows that have not been treated with the growth hormone rBST. Director of corporate communications, Jeff Beckman, said: ‘We are looking closely at every ingredient in our products and how we describe them. We will strive for simplicity with all of our ingredients, but we may not achieve it with every product. ‘We are leading industry conversations with suppliers and building our manufacturing capabilities to pursue non-genetically modified ingredients. This is a long-term journey and we are starting with some of our largest and most popular brands. ‘The ingredients we are transitioning to non-GM in both Hershey’s Kisses Milk Chocolates and Hershey’s Milk Chocolate Bar are sugar and soy lecithin.’ In the US, Hershey also intends to roll out ‘simple snacking products’ without high fructose corn syrup or artificial colours and flavours, such as Brookside Dark Chocolate Fruit & Nut Bars. It also plans to introduce a full ingredient glossary and profiles of the firm’ s suppliers on its website.","Decision comes after Vermont votes for law requiring labelling of GM food .

"A majority of Americans who received government subsidies to help pay for their Obamacare insurance policies will have to give some of that money back when they file their tax returns, according to research published Tuesday by the tax preparation firm H&R Block. Those taxpayers will owe about $530 each, on average, amounting to a 17 per cent decrease in the typical tax refund. The Department of Health and Human Services announced on Feb. 9 that nearly 6.5 million people who live in the 37 states covered by its HealthCare.gov website would qualify for an Obamacare tax credit this year since htey can't afford to pay the full price for medical insurance. That means nationwide more than 4.5 million will see part of their April 15 refunds shaved away, according to a Daily Mail Online analysis. TAX BITE FOR MANY: Portions of about 4.5 million Obamacare insurance subsidies will have to be paid back this year . 'This is what happens when you write 3,000 page laws in the basement with lobbyists and egghead theorists managing the chaos,' said Americans for Tax Reform chief Grover Norquist . The tax-prep assistance company based its finding on data collected from its customers during the first six weeks of 2015, finding that 52 percent of those who got Obamacare subsidies in the form of tax credits will have to refund part of the money to the government. 'The level of payback of the Advance Premium Tax Credit is significant in that it's costing taxpayers a large percentage of their refund – a refund many of them count on to pay household expenses,' H&R Block health care and tax services vice president Mark Ciaramitaro said Tuesday. Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that has long pushed for simpler tax laws and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, told Daily Mail Online that the hit to Americans' bottom lines is a natural consequence of an unwieldy addition to an already mammoth tax code. ATR president Grover Norquist called it 'another Obamacare unpleasant surprise.' 'This is what happens when you write 3,000 page laws in the basement with lobbyists and egghead theorists managing the chaos,' Norquist said. '$530 is a slap in the face reminder that ""There ain't no such thing as a free lunch"".' When Americans first used the chronically troubled Healthcare.gov website to enroll in coverage at the end of 2013, the Department of Health and Human Secrvices used their 2012 income to determine how much of a subsidy they would receive. But many people earned more in 2013, and still more in 2014. For them, subsidies based on their 2012 incomes would later turn out to be too high. 'This income underreporting has led to a majority of Marketplace-enrolled taxpayers paying back a portion of the tax credit,' Ciaramitaro said. 'The average tax refund for these taxpayers was almost $3,100 but it was reduced by $530 due to the tax credit reconciliation process.' Norquist's group said the people affected by the unexpected tax-day hits to their wallets are law-income earners. 'Higher income taxpayers received no tax subsidy and aren't facing this tax season surprise,' ATR explained. 'Families of four earning less than $97,000 are eligible for a credit. So is a single mother with two children earning less than $80,000 and an unmarried/childless taxpayer earning less than about $12,000.' Families that earn even less are more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid, a taxpayer-funded medical plan whose new enrollees have comprised most of the newly insured under Obamacare. The Internal Revenue Service, which administers the Obamacare tax-credit program and collects taxes on behalf of the U.S. Treasury, is already dealing with a shortage of staff because of budget cuts. It's unclear how that situation will affect the first year's settling of the Affordable Care Act's tax dust. But the iRS is already slowing down the program that audits taxpayers' annual paperwork to recover unpaid or underpaid taxes. Last year the agency performed the fewest audits in a decade, and this year the number is expected to be even lower. 'The math is pretty simple,' IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said Tuesday in a speech to the New York State Bar Association. 'There are fewer audits because we have fewer auditors.'","Americans who bought Obamacare insurance in 2013 and 2014 based their subsidy calculations on their 2012 income levels .
More than half of those earned more than they estimated, meaning they qualified for a smaller subsidy than what they got .
Those affected are all lower-income and middle-class people who earn too much to qualify for Medicare but still qualify for subsidies .

"Julie Bishop has taken her love of emojis to another level by opting to answer a question from Today's Karl Stefanovic by morphing her face into one of the characters. The Foreign Minister was asked if she knew what a Thermomix was after several Senators were left confused on Tuesday when the $2,000 cooking appliance appeared on a list of items the Governor General was after for his two residences. 'This is how it was discussed in Senate estimates yesterday... they said they didn't know what a Thermomix is. Julie Bishop, do you know what a Thermomix is?' Stefanovic asked. Ms Bishop responded: 'I'm going to answer in emoji' as she raised her eyebrows and stared wide-eyed into the camera. 'That's why you rock, Julie Bishop,' Stefanovic said as he laughed hysterically. Scroll down for video . Julie Bishop was asked if she knew what a Thermomix was on live television on Wednesday and she opted to answer in the form of an emoji (pictured) Ms Bishop has made her love of emojis clear in the past having once only responded to tweets with the characters for several hours. Her response comes after the multi-talented kitchen appliance sparked debate in a Senate hearing on Tuesday when Labor senator Joe Ludwig read through a list of kitchen appliances put forward by Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove. 'You're seeking four stick blenders, two food processors... and you're going to have to help me with this - a Thermomix?' he said. 'I don't know what a Thermomix is.' The Governor General's list of appliances, estimated to be worth between $80,000-$100,000, are for his two residences - Yarralumla in Canberra and Admiralty House in Sydney. Committee chair and South Australian senator Cory Bernardi ridiculed Mr Ludwig, asking: 'Where have you been?' Ms Bishop responded to Karl Stefanovic's (right) question by mimicking the emoji face (left) as she raised her eyebrows and stared wide-eyed into the camera . The German-designed 'twelve appliances in one' device has an almost cult-like following with thousands of loyal users around the world. 'Queensland,' Senator Ludwig responded. 'A kitchen aid mixer, an upright freezer, a deep fryer and a pasta machine. And what's a Thermomix?,' he continued. The Governor General's official secretary, Mark Fraser, confessed: 'I don't know what a Thermomix is.' 'So there are a couple of us who don't know what a Thermomix is,' Senator Ludwig announced. Attempting to fill the Senate's Finance and Public Administration Committee in on the almost $2,000 kitchen toy, Senator Bernardi explained: 'They're very popular amongst the home masterchefs of today.' They cannot be bought in stores and shoppers hold 'Thermomix parties' similar to Tupperware parties where a consultant comes out to a customer's home and demonstrates how it works to a group of their friends. There are more than 3,000 Thermomix consultants across Australia. 'Is that the elite trendies that use that, are they?' asked Senator Ludwig. The Governor General's office has requested a Thermomix but the Governor General's official secretary Mark Fraser (left) was forced to confess to Labor senator Joe Ludwig (right) he didn't know what it is . The Governor General's (pictured) office put out a tender for $80,000 - $100,000 worth of new kitchen equipment . 'In Queensland, you may refer to them as that, I just refer to them as those who have a particular interest in cooking,' Senator Bernardi retorted. Noticing he'd touched a nerve, Senator Ludwig probed: 'Is that the new model or the old model?' 'I'm no Masterchef myself all I know is that my team and with the expert advice of kitchen consultants have given us advice on the sorts of things our kitchen requires in order for it to function properly ' Mr Fraser said. Senator Ludwig then took the opportunity to point out how much the Governor General's office is spending elsewhere. 'You have $168,000 spent on redundancies, one involuntary, you have a request for a speechwriter and a media advisor… the previous Governor General managed not to require them. 'And now you have a couple hundred thousand spent on that amount, plus an additional amount on kitchen appliances. You wonder where the priorities are,' he said. But Mr Fraser reasoned that they need the new kitchen appliances to maintain the 'heritage properties'. 'We're seeking to do so in the most efficient manner possible hence we're seeking to replace 14 kitchen items,' he said.

"My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson has been at the centre of controversy this week, after his ex-wife claimed in a TV interview that he's a 'deadbeat dad' who doesn't see or support his kids. Following the explosive A Current Affair interview, TV WEEK published quotes from the former tennis professional discussing his difficult divorce, saying the situation 'is not ideal'. 'Obviously I'd like to spend more time with them,' he told the magazine. Scroll down for video . 'Deadbeat dad'? My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson spoke to TV WEEK magazine about his difficult divorce and wanting to 'spend more time with them [his kids]' However, Channel Seven claim the TV WEEK interview was done prior to Adam's ex-wife's interview earlier this week and the article has since been taken off their website. At the time the former tennis pro had said: 'Any split from a former wife is going to be tough and yeah it is tough,' he said, adding: 'Things end because both parties are unhappy.' 'If everything was great we’d still be together.' In the explosive interview, Cindy Anderson claimed the former tennis pro hadn't seen his children in approximately a year and owes close to $40,000 in child support. Cindy also claimed her ex is friends with one of the show's judges, Pete Evans, which she calls a 'conflict of interest'. Old interview? Channel Seven claims Adam's TV Week quotes were from an interview before his ex-wife's TV appearance earlier in the week and was not a comment on the recent claims . Owing child support: Cindy Anderson told A Current Affair on Monday night that he owes their five children approximately twelve months worth of child support, amounting to tens of thousands of dollars . A Channel Seven spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia in response to Cindy's claims: 'This is a private matter between the parties involved.' Channel Seven also refuted the assertion, that Adam and Pete are friends: 'They [Adam and Pete] met for the first time on the program'. Adam's former wife of almost 20 years, told A Current Affair on Monday night that she was speaking out on the show instead of dealing with the matter privately because, 'He has blocked my number and both his childrens' numbers - the older two girls have phones'. Adam's ex said she feels no bitterness that he has moved on and re-married Carol Molloy - his partner on the Channel 7 reality show - but she claims that's when her issues with child support payments began. Cindy also claimed that Adam used to coach My Kitchen Rules judge Pete on the tennis court and that Adam worked at Pete's Kings Cross restaurant Hugo's, in Sydney, after she split with him. Happier times: The couple were married for almost 20 years and had five children together . Ranging in age: Their kids are aged between eight years and 15 years of age . 'He has known Pete Evans, he knows him through tennis, through coaching him,' Cindy told reporter Brady Halls. 'We get no financial support at all,' she also told Brady. Cindy claims her concern is  that the large sum owning to her has amassed over the past year, which she says 'worries me considerably in that my youngest is only 8 - he has many more years where he needs support from his father.' 'The children also have no emotional support from him. He does not ring them, nor come and see them,' she said, adding 'they do not receive a card [for birthdays] in the mail, not even a phone call.' 'He's never played an active, massive role in their lives anyway...but basically his role now is non-existent, he's pretty much wiped his hands clean of the children,' Cindy said. Upset: The blonde single mother says she went on the show for the tell all after Adam's allegedly blocked her calls and the numbers of their two eldest daughters . The blonde single mother also claimed that the lack of funds has reached a point where it's 'significantly impacting on the children'. Cindy not only took aim at Adam during the interview but also at the Child Support Agency and producers of My Kitchen Rules. 'It seems there is little they [child support agency] can do, irrespective of him being in the print that he's working at three private schools doing tennis, irrespective of his face being on My Kitchen Rules. 'They consistently say there is no source of collection, there is no avenue for us to collect revenue,' she said. On TV: Cindy says there is no bitterness that Adam has moved on and  re-married recently, to his MKR partner Carol Molloy (pictured) Spokesman and General Manager for the Department of Human services, who over-sees the Child Support Agency, Hank Jongen told Brady: 'I can't talk about individual cases but let me assure you, that we go to great lengths in order to enforce child support obligations.'

"Fightback: Defence minister Anna Soubry denied using the C-word and threatened to sue the Mail . It was supposed to be a warts and all documentary showing what really goes on in the corridors of power. But the most explosive part of the fly-on-the-wall film about the inner workings of Parliament was yesterday dramatically edited out amid claims it showed a Tory minister shout an obscenity at Ed Miliband. Anna Soubry threatened legal action and issued a furious denial just hours before the final episode of Inside The Commons was to air on BBC Two last night. A comment that sounded like 'sanctimonious c***' was shouted at the Labour leader during a Commons debate last June. It appeared to come from the direction of the defence minister but she said this suggestion was 'outrageous'. The heckling was recorded by programme maker Michael Cockerell during filming in the chamber shortly after the Queen set out the Government's agenda. In a preview tape seen by journalists, Mr Cockerell said: 'Official television coverage, even though it is heavily restricted, has fuelled public antagonism to MPs. 'But our cameras have witnessed the unsanitised version in which MPs sometimes use the most offensive language.' Miss Soubry could then be clearly seen and heard on the back row of the Tory benches heckling Mr Miliband. A publicist working for the production company behind the film emailed journalists on Monday claiming Miss Soubry had sworn. Miss Soubry, 58, was alerted and denied that she had used the word. The BBC then removed the sound of the heckling from the programme and the reference to the 'most offensive language'. Instead in his narration, Mr Cockerell referred to 'behaviour even rougher than is usually seen.' When told about the allegation by the Mail, Miss Soubry said she planned to contact her solicitor and the Commons Speaker. Footage: Presenter Michael Cockerell's voiceover to this footage of a Commons debate was changed, cutting out a reference to 'most offensive language'. Instead he cited 'behaviour even rougher than is usually seen' She insisted: 'I can absolutely assure you I have never used language like that. I would never use language like that and most certainly not in the House of Commons, nor against any opponent. 'There is no way, I am telling you now, with the volume of my voice, that I would, even if I was minded to, which I am not. I abhor the word. 'Never ever. That word is never used in the House. Outrageous.' Miss Soubry, who has been reprimanded by Speaker John Bercow for behaviour in the Commons, said the debating chamber was noisy, but foul language was never used. When offered the opportunity by the Mail to view the footage, Miss Soubry said she had 'more important things' to do. The BBC refused to comment on whether it had come under any pressure from Miss Soubry, her solicitor, the Ministry of Defence or the Conservative Party. Denial: Michael Cockerell denied any knowledge of the scene and said the BBC had editorial control . Mr Cockerell yesterday declined to talk about the scene when contacted by the Mail and even claimed to have no knowledge of its existence. He said: 'I don't know what you're talking about. I don't recognise what you're talking about. Anything you're talking about is not in the programme. 'The BBC has editorial control and they make the decisions on the way the programme is cut.' Miss Soubry, who once described herself as 'not a girl but a tough old bird', worked as a TV journalist before becoming a barrister. She was elected as Tory MP for Broxtowe, Notts, at the last election in 2010. In 2013, she apologised to Ukip leader Nigel Farage after making lewd remarks about him. There is no list of banned swear words in the Commons, but terms deemed to be unparliamentary language according to the rule book include: pharisee, swine, jackass, hooligan, blackguard, cad, ruffian and insulting dog. In November communities minister Penny Mordaunt apologised for using a Commons speech on animal welfare to say obscene words after a dare at a dinner with Navy friends. A BBC spokesman said: 'Changes can and are often made to the final version broadcast, as is the case with this episode.' Anna Soubry: 'It is very important that you run this past your lawyers because you will not defame me' I beg your pardon. I can be heard saying what? No. Absolutely not. Never. Never. And if you print that I will sue you because I would never. The C-word? No absolutely not, I would never use that word and I would never use it in the House of Commons and I would certainly never use it… I'm not having that. I can absolutely assure you I have never used language like that and I can equally assure you on the back row nobody, we wouldn't think of shouting a word like that, the foulest word. I'm now going to ring both the press office here and at HQ, and I'm going to ring my solicitor. I would never say that and that's an extremely, extremely serious allegation. Never ever. That word is never used in the House. Outrageous. Forgive me because I need to make a number of phone calls, because I'm not having that. I would never use language like that and most certainly not in the House of Commons, nor against any opponent. I don't use that word so you better not print it. There is no way, I am telling you now, with the volume of my voice that I would, even if I was minded to, which I am not. I abhor the word. There is no way. You guys should know this. You couldn't shout out language like that. No, I'm sorry. End of debate. I would never use that word. I know that I do not use that word and if you print that I will bloody sue you because I would never use that word. I'm going to go to the Speaker. If there's one person, well more than one, that the Speaker would be listening to, it's the likes of me. You heard me use the word c*** in the House of Commons? No sir. Never. Because I do not use it in my ordinary life and I would never use it in the House of Commons and I am profoundly offended at the suggestion I ever would. I just don't use that word and anyone will tell you that because I'm an old feminist who hates that word. If there's word I loathe. it's that word. And the idea I would call anybody in the House of Commons, I don't use the word anyway, it's just inconceivable, I don't do that. I am sorry I absolutely don't. You can hear how strongly I feel. You're telling me you've heard me use the C-word. You really are certain? I do not use the C-Word. Come on. You know how that place operates, you don't sit and shout out foul language. Nobody does. I think it is very important that you run this past your lawyers because you will not defame me, sir. You will absolutely not. I would never dream shouting out the C-word of all words. The one thing you never do is shout out foul language. You don't behave like that. We're noisy and I don't say we're not, but we don't use foul language. I put my hands up when I do something wrong, but I'm not having this. I would never do that. I'm not having it. This is a very serious allegation. I can assure you I do not use the C-word and I certainly do not swear in the House of Commons. None of us do. I know some people don't like our antics, but we do not. You wouldn't. It's inconceivable. You better not defame me, I will have you, and I mean that. Do forgive me, goodbye.","Anna Soubry threatened legal action and issued furious denial over claim .

"Tokyo is hoping to cash in on its connection with Godzilla by creating a hotel dedicated to the sci-fi film of the same name. The new look Godzilla themed Hotel Gracery in Tokyo's Shinjuku ward is dedicated to the mutant dinosaur that first destroyed the city in the 1954 film, and then went on to further destroy the city in numerous remakes over the years. In fact, the giant reptilian creature has crushed just about every famous building in Japan including Tokyo Tower and the Parliament building. The head of Godzilla pokes out of the hotel roof, meaning you'll never forget where you are staying in Tokyo . The giant reptilian creature has crushed just about every famous building in Japan including Tokyo Tower and the Parliament building. Godzilla first destroyed the city of Tokyo in the 1954 film, and then in all the subsequent remakes . Japan, the only nation in the world to suffer atomic bombings, has a soft spot for the fire-breathing creature as representing the suffering unleashed by nuclear weapons. And according to market research, Godzilla could be a major tourist attraction for fans who would be keen to stay in the Godzilla Hotel. Inside even the toilets are Godzilla themed, and there are rooms filled with Godzilla memorabilia inside the 30 story hotel. And with a copy of the monster's head on top of the hotel, they promise to have the best views in the city. The hotel is on the top of the Shinjuku's Toho Cinema, where fans can watch the various Godzilla films in all their glory, and a viewing platform for fans to get up close and personal with the monster or at least its head for a selfie with a little bit extra. Godzilla could be a major tourist attraction for fans who would be keen to stay in the Godzilla Hotel . Inside even the toilets are Godzilla themed, and there are rooms filled with Godzilla memorabilia inside the 30 story hotel . Price for the rooms in the hotel which opens on 24th of April are around £200 on weekdays and £300 on public holidays and weekends. Hotel Gracery spokesman Eigo Ueda said: 'This Godzilla head is part of our strategy for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics when many foreign tourists will visit and we want to provide the best experience to them. What better way than to appeal to tourists with a giant Godzilla figure.' They also hoping to cash in with a further Godzilla movie set to appear in Japan next year. The announcement this week from Japanese film studio Toho comes after the success earlier this year of the Hollywood Godzilla, directed by Gareth Edwards, which grossed more than £320 million ($500million) worldwide. Toho said in 2004 it had made its last Godzilla film, the 28th in the series centred on the irradiated monster, which first stomped into the world in 1954. Over the years, Godzilla movies fell out of favour even among Japanese fans. The hotel is on the top of the Shinjuku's Toho Cinema, where fans can watch the various Godzilla films in all their glory . Japan, the only nation in the world to suffer atomic bombings, has a soft spot for the fire-breathing creature . But the latest Hollywood Godzilla, complete with spikes down its back and a terrifying roar, received relatively favourable reviews in Japan, unlike the 1998 Hollywood Godzilla, directed by Roland Emmerich, which purist fans hated. Toho said recent innovations in computer-graphics technology were behind its decision to revive Godzilla. The Toho Godzilla is set for release in 2016, before Edwards releases his sequel for Legendary Pictures and Warner Brothers in 2018. The Tokyo-based company, which owns the rights for Godzilla, declined to say whether it would bring back the man-in-a-rubber suit behind the original Godzilla or rely on computer graphics - or have both. The widely praised original black-and-white 'Godzilla' was directed by Ishiro Honda. Other directors took over for the subsequent Japanese works, which at times became absurdly comical, featuring battles with manga-like, or cartoonish, monsters.","The Godzilla themed Hotel Gracery will be in in Tokyo's Shinjuku ward .

"Mohammed Bashir, 26, wrote the offensive post while high on cannabis after speaking with friends about a break-in at his local mosque . A Muslim shopworker has avoided jail after calling for a man who broke into his local mosque to be beheaded, and offering a £1,000 reward for whoever carried out the deed. Father-of-two Mohammed Bashir, 26, was accused of a 'moment of madness' after posting a CCTV image of the culprit on trading site Gumtree, along with a note reading 'Reward, Beheading'. Bashir wrote the message while high on cannabis after a thief stole £4,000 from the Jamia Mosque  near Oldham, Greater Manchester, where he is a member, on January 4. Oldham Magistrates' Court heard the mosque had posted the image on their own Facebook page asking for the criminal to be identified, but after smoking drugs with friends, Bashir decided to take things a step further. Angered by the break-in the day before, Bashir, who works in a nearby Morrisons, logged on to his Gumtree account and made the offensive post, before going to pick up his daughter from school. The court was told that when Bashir sobered up shortly afterwards he went to remove the advert, only to find that it had already been deleted by Gumtree. However the message had been online long enough for a panicked shopper to take a picture of it and send it to police, after which Bashir was arrested. He later admitted the incident to police, telling them he had 'acted stupidly', and adding that he had been chastised by the mosque, his family and his friends. Bashir was ordered to complete 80 hours unpaid work and pay a £60 victim surcharge and £85 fine . In mitigation, defence lawyer Naila Akhtar said her client had been married for nine years and has two children aged 3 and 6. She said since Bashir’s arrest his name and address had appeared on an English Defence League website. Miss Akhtar said: 'Mr Bashir had admitted that this was a moment of madness and completely out of character. 'He has been condemned by the mosque, his family and his friends for his actions for which he has taken full responsibility. Oldham Magistrates' Court heard that Bashir offered the reward after a man broke into this mosque in Werneth, Greater Manchester, where he is a member, and stole £4,000 . 'Police have said that he has been fully cooperative and is deemed a low risk. He was not thinking of the impact this action would have especially considering the current climate. 'Police are satisfied that there is no level of extremism and his religious views are not at a level of concern.' Miss Akhtar added: 'He says he never takes drugs or alcohol but that on this occasion after smoking the cannabis decided to post the ad on Facebook using CCTV images from the mosque Facebook page. 'Mr Bashir works two jobs, seven days a week since he was 16, his manager even sees him as a son and she says this is totally out of character for him. 'After his job his main priority is supporting his children and his wife. His life has been considerably affected by his actions which has caused him great anxiety. Bashir said he tried to remove the post after 15 minutes, but discovered it had already been deleted. During that time a shopper had also discovered it, taken a picture, and sent it to police . 'His actions have even had a negative impact on the mosque he attends as well as others in the area. He accepts that this is his fault.' The court heard another of Bashir’s children Elizabeth died in 2013 after she swallowed a battery in a tragic accident. Passing sentence JP Kathleen Kershaw said: 'We feel that this was a moment of madness to which you showed a good response and was very cooperative with police. We hope that we do not see you again Mr Bashir.' Shortly after Bashir was arrested, the mosque removed the CCTV image and posted a message saying: 'We are all outraged at this despicable crime but we must act with cool heads and wisdom. 'The last thing we want is one of our own getting in trouble for something they may have said in (justified) anger.'","Father-of-two Mohammed Bashir, 26, was angered by break-in at mosque .

"These stunning photographs show a lost vision of New York City, where streetcars barreled down Third Avenue, the Empire State Building was the tallest in town - and five cents could get you a a bag of fresh-roasted peanuts. Taken by photographer Todd Webb in 1946, the collection of 15 black and white images show the then-bustling docks of Manhattan, the skyline as it was before glass-clad skyscrapers rose up in decades to come - and the people who called the city home. Webb was around 40 years old when the images were taken, and had just returned from a posting as a Naval Photographer in the Second World War. Scroll down for video . Old smokey days: This collection of photographs by Todd Webb has been republished - the above showing the New York City skyline in 1946, when the Empire State Building (right) and Chrysler building (center left) were still the tallest two structures in the metropolis . Old-school: The images show yesteryear NYC transportation, including the image to the left of the now-demolished Third Avenue El train metro line, with a street car running underneath. To the right, a photograph taken at the interaction of Second Avenue and 50th Street shows the Chrysler Building standing tall, not yet surrounded by other midtown high-rises . Working man: In this famous image, taken around Battery Park in Manhtattan, shows a local tradesman selling roasted peanuts on the street for five cents a bag . From the docks: The photographs show how Manhattan's ports and piers still thronged with trade ships. This is the scene from the Fulton Fish Market Wharf . As well as the iconic sights and architecture of the metropolis, Webb's images also took in locals around his Harlem neighborhood, and working folk around the city. The images have been brought out of the archives and published again in a limited-edition collection by 21st Editions. According to photography experts, Webb, who won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1955, was notable in getting to know the subjects of his portraits before shooting - sometimes spending days talking before wielding the camera. In an introduction to the images, Harvard professor John Stauffer wrote how Webb was also unusual in taking an interest in photographing black people and interracial friendships - the kind he would have seen on the streets of Harlem around him. Although the year was blighted by the death of his mentor Alfred Stieglitz, Webb - who died in 2000 - remembered it as one of best and most productive. Pals: This photograph, called 123rd Street (Boys with Toy Gun) shows a black child and white friends playing in Harlem. Webb's writings show how he despised racism - describing seeing 'Whites Only' signs on a visit to the segregated South 'hard to take' Famous: This image, published in Fortune magazine, shows the view of downtown Manhattan from the Empire State Building - then the highest view in the city. The same vista would now be dominated by the World Trade Center's Freedom Tower . In harmony: This photograph, called 'The Circle,' LaSalle at Amsterdam, shows a group of black and white children playing together around a pipe spraying water . Towering: This photograph, taken at the intersection of Madison Street and Pike Street, shows the view south towards the Manhattan Bridge . Harlem scenes: These photographs a hat store in Harlem's 125th street, and the nearby offices of The People's Voice, a weekly black newspaper, with a local standing outside. The paper had just moved offices . Fine motor: This image shows the car of Lamar Perkins, a prominent Harlem citizen and New York state's assistant attorney general . Sneaky shot: Webb described how this photograph was taken the first time he walked over the Brooklyn Bridge - with only enough film for six frames. When he returned the next day with more, officials were enforcing a photography ban - so he had to turn back . Commerce: This image shows traders on Suffolk Street, near Manhattan's Chinatown . Relaxing: Webb found these five boys on a street in Harlem, and asked them to pose for him - a process documented in his other photos, too .","Collection of photographs taken by Todd Webb around 1946 has been republished .

"A huge mound of rotting rubbish has been piling up outside a home after it became a dumping ground for fly-tipping residents when the tenants moved out. The giant pile of litter, which includes dozens of black bin bags, wooden pallets and food waste, has been growing outside the property in Acocks Green, Birmingham, since the tenants left over a month ago. The rubbish mountain is so high that it blocks the majority of the front downstairs window and completely blocks the path to the front door. It also spills out onto the pavement of the residential road. Environmental officers from Birmingham City Council have ordered that the rubbish is to be removed  by Thursday and plan to question neighbours over who is responsible after sifting through it . Environmental health officers from Birmingham City Council have now ordered that the rubbish is removed in full by Thursday and plan to question neighbours over who is responsible. Officers have already painstakingly sifted through some of the bin bags and have traced where much of the rubbish originated from. Councillor John O'Shea alerted the authority to the rubbish mound after receiving a complaint from a resident living on the road last week. He told MailOnline: 'The rubbish was piled high, I have never seen anything like it at a property before. 'I alerted the environmental health department and the landlord has been given seven days to move it. 'It appears the rubbish may have started piling up there from as far back as five months ago. 'Two thirds was building waste, rubble and plasterboard but the front of the pile was mainly black bag waste and looked mostly like household waste such as food containers and cans. 'In the landlord's defence, I don't think the black bag waste has come from that house. 'The council's environmental health team did some bag searches and have traced the rubbish to other houses so those residents will be getting a visit. 'I have not idea why they have done that though, we have weekly collections for them. Mr O'Shea said those who were fly-tipping at the property were ruining it for other residents in the area and said the council wouldn't hesitate to prosecute. 'By and large our policy is to educate first but if you are somebody who is dumping on the street then we will enforce and that can involve fines and prosecution. 'We don't have a major problem with fly-tipping but there are always little spots where people try to dump stuff. 'This is the worst case I've seen in quite a while.' The giant mound of litter, which includes dozens of black bin bags, wooden pallets and food waste (pictured), has been growing outside the property in Acocks Green, Birmingham, since the tenants left over a month ago . He added: 'It's about loving where we live. The vast majority of residents look after their homes, they don't rubbish or drop litter, it's just a small number who for whatever reason decide they don't want to live like others. 'It ruins it for the others who want to keep the street nice. It's not on. You know you're dumping rubbish where it shouldn't be. There's no excuse for it, it's a criminal act. 'Ultimately if you don't change your behaviour we will fine you and prosecute.' Neighbours claimed the previous tenants had left the property in a bad state and the landlord had decided to gut the property as well as carry out building work. Retired driving instructor Tom Maguire, 74, who lives a few doors down, said: 'The rubbish has been piling up over the last few months. 'Once people see bin bags there they put more on them and it has just spiralled out of control. 'It has been an eyesore for far too long and I was getting worried that it was going to get even worse so I am glad it looks like the message has finally got through.' Another neighbour, who didn't want to be named, said: 'It has been in that state for over a month since the last family who were renting the property left. 'The pile has been getting higher and higher. 'I think the property was left in a bad condition and it looks like the landlord has stripped the property inside and has carried out some building work. 'The building waste is still there but our main concern was the household rubbish as we feared there could be a rat infestation. 'Fortunately the household rubbish has been cleared now.' After being given seven days notice to move the rubbish last Thursday, the landlord has made some headway in removing the waste. The black bin bags have now been cleared but building waste still remains at the site . Part of the mound of rotting rubbish has been removed, although the landlord still has some waste to clear . Birmingham City Council said the rubbish was brought to the authority's attention last week and said it took 'swift and robust action' to rectify the problem. The council said the landlord has been given seven days to clear the rubbish, meaning it must all be removed by Thursday. Some of the rubbish has already been removed from the site, although much of the building waste remains outside the property. Councillor Lisa Trickett, cabinet member for a Green, Smart and Sustainable City at Birmingham Council, said: 'We are all saddened by images of fly tipped waste as this is a blight on our city and those responsible should be ashamed of their actions. They clearly have no pride in our city. 'We are working with the local businesses and communities, to create a better understanding of how they should dispose of their domestic waste, and are actively tackling fly-tipping by investigating the unscrupulous people who consider dumping waste at the roadside to be acceptable. Let me be clear, it is not. 'I know that every resident, business and visitor is horrified by this kind of anti-social behaviour and we would ask anybody that witnesses those responsible to come forward to help us bring them to justice. 'We will use all the powers available to us to take enforcement action and prosecute anyone who does fly tip in Birmingham – regardless of whether it is garden waste, a piece of furniture or anything else – and would encourage anyone with information on any cases to contact us in the strictest confidence.' A builder who was working at the house today refused to comment or give the name of the landlord. The pile of rubbish started with old building materials and waste and gradually grew as fly-tippers dumped household bin bag. Tom Maguire, a neighbour, said: 'The rubbish has been piling up over the last few months' Councillors said the rubbish is a 'blight on our city' and said fly-tippers 'should be ashamed of their actions'","Huge mound of rubbish dumped outside vacant property in Birmingham .

"Bishop of Shrewsbury Mark Davies: Bishops should 'highlight  moral questions which underpin debate' Roman Catholic bishops will today urge 4million worshippers to vote for political candidates who promote marriage. Cardinal Vincent Nichols will say that stable families and help for the frail and elderly are key planks in advice about the general election for the church’s five million British followers. The Right Reverend Mark Davies, Bishop of Shrewsbury, said yesterday: ‘No-one expects bishops to offer a political programme at election time but to highlight the moral questions which underpin the public debate. 'Faced with the unprecedented scale of family breakdown and its immense human and social costs, this election debate surely cannot ignore support for marriage. 'At the very foundation of society is respect for the sanctity of human life. We mustn’t forget the newly-elected parliament in 2015 will decide the legality of assisted suicide in our hospitals and care homes with far-reaching consequences for the way society regards the sick and the elderly.' It contrasts with the widely-criticised manifesto by Anglican bishops last week which made no mention of marriage. Instead the Church of England said families could best by helped by outside organisations like housing associations or credit unions. Nor did the CofE bishops choose to remind voters of the difficulties of elderly people needing care nor the scourges of drugs and pornography. The Church of England election letter was the first attempt to sway voters by the Anglican bishops and was widely criticised for its focus on inequality and the alleged evils of the market economy, consumerism and the legacy of Margaret Thatcher. Roman Catholic bishops, however, have regularly given advice to churchgoers on the central issues they should consider in advance of each general election. The Catholic advice, to be launched by Cardinal Vincent Nichols, has been prepared over three months by a team of four bishops and will strongly remind voters of the need to help stabilise families. It comes at a time when family campaigners and some Tories have been calling loudly for bigger tax breaks to reward couples who marry, and an end to the tax and benefit penalties piled on mothers who choose to stay at home to raise their children. Faith: The proposals will be launched by Vincent Nichols, pictured centre with newly-ordained priests in 2011 . A bill to legalise assisted suicide is currently being considered in the Lords. The bill, put forward by former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, would allow terminally ill patients to be prescribed poison if two doctors approve. A small tax break for married people was introduced last week in line with a promise made by David Cameron in the 2010 Tory manifesto. The concession means married couples and civil partners who are not higher rate taxpayers will be able to transfer £1,000 of their tax free allowance to their spouse or partner. It will adde £3.85 a week to the incomes of 1.6 million people, but analysts believe that in practice the gain will be even less for more than a million people, because for them Coalition benefit reforms will take away £2.50 of the gain. Roman Catholic bishops will distribute half a million copies of their letter to parishes.","Advice drafted by bishops and launched by Cardinal Vincent Nichols .

Nowsch's lawyers told ABC that they believe he was acting in self-defense. They later told CNN that Tammy Meyer's son, Brandon, pointed a gun at Nowsch before the shooting began and said that his client had received death threats. However the victim's husband, Robert Meyers, said he thinks his wife realized she was in danger, and was fatally wounded after trying to lure a vehicle and motorist who threatened her away from her home. That's not road rage, that's intentional, Meyers said in an interview  after a court appearance by the suspect, his 19-year-old neighbor, Erich Milton Nowsch Jr. 'My wife was followed home and murdered,' Meyers said. Meyers' theory adds yet another dimension to a case already marked by stunning revelations and conflicting accounts from police and the Meyers family. Initially, the family said Tammy Meyers was shot in the head after a confrontation with another motorist while she drove her teenage daughter home from a late-night driving lesson at a neighborhood school. The public was told that Brandon Meyers grabbed his gun and came out of the house, firing back at the fleeing silver car. Last week, family members and police revealed that Tammy Meyers dropped her daughter at home and went back out with her son and the family's green Buick Park Avenue sedan to find the motorist who frightened her earlier. Erich Nowsch Jr appears in a Las Vegas court on Monday. A March 10 preliminary hearing will determine if he should stand trial . What followed was a tire-squealing confrontation with a silver car and gunfire several blocks from the Meyers home. No one was injured. Then, the fatal shooting on the cul-de-sac several houses from the Meyers home. 'I don't know what she saw,' Robert Meyers said on Monday. 'She's dead. I can't ask her. But this was intentional - to kill the person in the green car.' Mr Meyers said that the story of what happened that night has been so confused as all the facts didn't come out immediately . He told ABC: 'My son was very hurt, thinking I was going to blame him for his mom going down, and he didn’t come forward with all the things.' Mr Meyers said his daughter has helped him get a clearer picture of what went on. According to the widower, a suspect, who is still at large, stood in front of the hood of his wife's car and threatened to kill her and his daughter. Mr Meyers added: 'And after that, my daughter said my wife spun out to get away from this guy right on this street. 'My daughter said my wife was going as fast as she could. ... My wife was as great driver. She came from a good stock of drivers.' Las Vegas police aren't commenting about the changing accounts, and aren't addressing whether Tammy Meyers' death resulted from a random road-rage shooting as it first appeared. Captain Christopher Tomaino told the media Friday that police were still looking for an accomplice who was with Nowsch, and questions about the case will eventually be answered. Robert Meyers, 49, was out of state when the shooting happened. He said on Monday his wife and Nowsch knew each other — well enough for the teen to hitch up his saggy shorts when Tammy Meyers approached him in the neighborhood park, so she wouldn't have to tell him to do so. It's not clear if they recognized each other during the shootings. Robert Meyers said Nowsch was probably familiar with the family's Buick, but might not have seen it since the windows were tinted dark last summer. Nowsch is charged with murder, attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle. He did not speak and did not enter a plea when he appeared in a Las Vegas court on Monday. A March 10 preliminary hearing will determine if he should stand trial. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson would then decide whether to seek the death penalty. 'Nothing is off the table,' he told KTNV. Police said Nowsch told friends he was at the park and became alarmed by a vehicle he thought was following him, so he called a friend to pick him up. Las Vegas police say Nowsch bragged to his friends several hours after the shooting that he 'got those kids, they were after me, and I got them'. Nowsch showed his friends a .45-caliber handgun and told them he fired several shots in the first encounter and 22 shots in the cul-de-sac, according to the police report. Robert Meyers and police said Brandon Meyers fired three shots during the second shooting. It wasn't clear if he hit a silver Audi with Nowsch and at least one other person inside, police said. Nowsch (left) is charged with the murder of Tammy Meyers (left and right), attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle last month . Nowsch lived with his single mother and her one-month-old daughter about a block from the Meyers family home. Tammy Meyers served as a mother figure to youngsters about the same age as her children, now 15 to 22 years old, Meyers said, and two Meyers sons attended high school with Nowsch. Meyers said that at least once, Tammy Meyers gave the teen $20 when he said he was hungry. Meyers also recalled Nowsch earning pocket money washing cars outside the Meyers family home. The teen and the neighborhood mom may have seen each other in passing the weekend of February 7-8, when Tammy Meyers walked the family dogs in the park where Nowsch often sat at a picnic bench with other teens, Robert Meyers said. 'Bunch of troublemakers,' Robert Meyers said. 'I wouldn't allow my kids to hang out with them.' But he denied there was any bad blood. Las Vegas police spokesman Larry Hadfield said investigators are still trying to locate the silver vehicle's driver, who has not been identified.","Erich Nowsch, 19, was arrested last Friday, a week after Tammy Meyers, 44, was fatally wounded by gunfire outside her Las Vegas home .

"A prestigious Sydney school erected memorial gates for a teacher who was known to be a 'notorious molester' with the inscription 'he touched us all', an inquiry has been told. Former Knox Grammar School student Scott Ashton, 44, told a royal commission hearing investigating how the Uniting Church and the private school responded to child abuse allegations, that he was left deeply confused by the tribute to the late Bruce Barrett. Mr Ashton called the art teacher a 'notorious molester' while giving evidence to the commission on Tuesday, as he revealed the abuse he had personally suffered at Barrett's hands in the Wahroonga school's classrooms on Sydney's North Shore. Scroll down for video . Former Knox Grammar School student Scott Ashton, told a royal commission hearing investigating how the Uniting Church and the private school responded to child abuse allegations, that he was left deeply confused by the tribute to the late Bruce Barrett .

Mr Ashton said he was inappropriately touched in sight of other staff and students in the playground . In his statement, read out by close friend Gretel Pinniger who is also known as the high profile Sydney dominatrix Madame Lash, Mr Ashton said Barrett would chase and tickle his students. He told the inquiry that Barrett would occasionally wear a red tie, announcing 'watch out boys, it's a red tie day' to signify someone would be canned that day. On one occasion, he recalled being chased by the teacher who then requested he stay back after class. Fearing that he would be caned, Mr Ashton was instead sexually assaulted. 'I felt ashamed of my abuse. I was deeply ashamed and unable to discuss it with anyone,' Mr Ashton said in his statement, according to News Corp. Pictured: Justice Coate at the Royal Commission. Mr Ashton's statement was read out by close friend Gretel Pinniger, who is also known as the high profile Sydney dominatrix Madame Lash . 'It was an issue which I avoided because any reminder of it would cause me severe stress and interfered with my ability to function and cope on a day-to-day basis.' Despite his notoriety, Mr Ashton said everyone at the school was expected to pay tribute to Barrett, who had died young. 'The fact that he was so well regarded by the school despite being a notorious molester made me feel very confused and powerless,' he said. Mr Ashton said he was nine when he went to Knox and from the start he was abused 'openly and brazenly' by another teacher, Barrie Stewart. On one occasion, Mr Ashton recalled being chased by the teacher who then requested he stay behind after class. Fearing that he would be caned, Mr Ashton was instead sexually assaulted .

In 2009, Stewart was convicted of five counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault. He was given a suspended sentence.

"A mother and her young daughter were left terrified after a charging rhino smashed into their car during a family day trip to a safari park. Vicky Liggins, 26, was driving through West Midlands Safari Park, in Worcestershire, with her 19-month-old daughter Evelyn and sister Beth Rees when the incident occurred. She said the Asian rhino, which weighs about the same as a car at two tonnes, charged at her Mitsubishi Warrior and shunted it with such force that the back wheels lifted off the ground. Vicky Liggins, 26 (right), was driving through West Midlands Safari Park, in Worcestershire, with her 19-month-old daughter Evelyn and sister Beth Rees when the two-tonne rhino (left) charged at her vehicle . The animal caused £500 worth of damage to her car including scratches and damage to the rear panels, a broken back light and dents. She said the trio were left 'absolutely petrified' by the incident at the safari park . The bank worker, from Dudley, West Midlands, said the trio were left 'absolutely petrified' by the ordeal and said the large animal had caused more than £500 worth of damage to her car. She said: 'I dread to think what would've happened if we'd been in a smaller, lighter vehicle. 'As we drove past the three rhinos, I thought they were too close. 'These animals are two tons - they weigh more than a car; they're dangerous. 'I didn't notice the rhino behind my car until it hit the vehicle with its horn. 'We were all really frightened. It then shunted us from behind with such force that the back wheel lifted off the ground. 'We were absolutely petrified. I thought the rhino was going to pierce the back panel and smash through the rear windscreen. 'We couldn't drive away because of the rhinos in front. 'My daughter was in tears and the sad thing is that she loves animals.' Ms Liggins said a range worker eventually came to their aid and helped move the rhinos from the scene. However, her car was left with a smashed back light, a crumpled rear and dents to the driver's side. The bank worker has criticised West Midlands Safari Park for not issuing an immediate apology and said the park should install barriers to stop damage to cars (right). She said her daughter (left) had been left terrified . West Midlands Safari Park gave Ms Liggins a £250 goodwill voucher following the incident and apologised . She is now calling for barriers to be installed at the safari park to prevent the rhinos wandering in front of vehicles. She said: 'It was one very scary and expensive day. 'As a member of the public you don't expect to be hit by a massive animal like that. 'I want the public to understand the dangers of safari parks. Even with so called ""rangers"" on site, it isn't safe.' The mother also criticised the way managers at the park handled the attack, which happened three weeks ago. 'I received no immediate apology and was referred to the ""terms and conditions"",' she said. The family were driving through an area where three rhinos were living when one of them charged at the car . West Midlands Safari Park apologised for the incident and handed Ms Liggins a goodwill voucher of £250. A spokesman added: 'The highlight of a visit to West Midland Safari Park is to drive amongst free-roaming animals and to get the chance to feed some of them. 'In addition, we also offer a guided minibus tour for a small extra charge. 'We welcome many, many thousands of visitors during the course of a year without mishap and, therefore, we are very sorry that wasn't so on this particular occasion'. The safari park, which describes itself as the 'best tourist attraction in the West Midlands', has more than 180 species of animals in its four-mile drive-through safari.","Vicky Liggins was driving through safari park when rhino charged at car .

"Members of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy say they will have to be forcibly removed from the site of a multi-million dollar redevelopment after receiving an eviction notice on Friday. The 'peaceful protest' was established in response to the commercial development of an area of land called 'The Block' in Redfern, Sydney, which protesters claim to be Indigenous land. The eviction notice was issued by the Aboriginal Housing Corporation, accusing the protesters of trespassing on land pigeon-holed for a retail and commercial redevelopment since last year. Protest: Aboriginal community members are accused of trespassing in long standing feud with the Aboriginal Housing Corporation who have issued a notice of eviction to remove them from redevelopment site . The eviction notice issued by Mick Mundine to protesters on Friday giving 48 hours to leave or risk being forcibly removed . The Pemulwuy project has been approved for commercial and retail redevelopment of the site. It consists of student accommodation for 154 people, a childcare space for 60, a gymnasium, a gallery and affordable social housing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families. Many protesters, such as the embassy's founder Jenny Munro, say the land is being stripped from the indigenous community in an effort to push Aboriginal people out of Redfern. 'The development of commercial and student housing does not assist the housing needs of our people in any way, shape or form,' Munro told Daily Mail Australia. Not giving up: Jenny Munro, a 59-year-old Wiradjuri woman, set up the tent embassy with community members in Redfern on May 26 2014 . Not happy: Although the group has been promised affordable housing for aboriginal families, protesters believe the site won't benefit the wider indigenous community . Jenny says a scheduled meeting for Tuesday was cancelled by the Aboriginal Housing Corporation due to to heavy media presence. She welcomes the eviction challenge saying their 'peaceful protest' will not be going anywhere. ‘They will have to move us physically,’ she said in a statement. Mick Mundine, chief executive officer of the Aboriginal Housing Company, says the land is private and as long as they are occupying it, it’s simply trespassing. Controversy: Chief Executive Officer if the Aboriginal Housing Company Mick Mundine (pictured left) with police as indigenous community members band around a fire at the Redfern site (pictured right) Flyers posted in the Redfern area attacking Aboriginal Housing Company CEO Mick Mundine for his role in the redevelopment . Mr Mundine, who leads the push for the Embassy's removal, says the development will improve social conditions and ensure ‘Aboriginal people enjoy the same standard of living as all other Australians.’ Protesters are doubtful of their future inclusion as developers had previously advertised that Aborigines had moved out of the suburb as well as stipulations that housing will not to be offered to those with a criminal history. This means many socially disadvantaged members of the aboriginal community would be excluded from the redevelopment.","Aboriginal protesters claim site in Redfern, Sydney, is Indigenous land .

"Tremors have reportedly hit a Florida city at least three times. Coral Gables residents have told local media they've felt the shaking inside their homes.

We have no reports of outages and no equipment issues during that time.' CBS Miami pointed out that a sonic boom reportedly took place Saturday - and reported that the times for the boom and the Coral Gables tremors failed to match. In that case, the American Meterological Society (AMS) said more than 230 reports came in of a fireball. Many of the reports came from central and northern Florida. Earlier this month, tremors and noises were also reported in St. Johns County, according to First Coast News. A St. Johns County Sheriff's Office (SJCSO) spokesman spoke to the television station at the time, and attributed the noises to being sonic booms from military flight training.","Tremors have hit Coral Gables, Florida, at least three times .

"She set the internet on fire last year by claiming to have an extra asset. But 21-year-old 'Jasmine Tridevil' became the subject of intense scrutiny after extraordinary images suggested she had become the first woman in the world to have an artificial third breast fitted. Then last week the wannabe pop star - real name Alisha Hessler - from Tampa, Florida broke her silence to insist she's not a hoaxer, defiantly claiming: 'I know my breasts are real and I do not care what anybody thinks.' But Daily Mail Online has now obtained secretly filmed images that prove once and for all that Hessler is lying. These photos – taken by a specialist thermal imaging camera - show her third breast is indeed a fake. Scrutinized: Many commentators have claimed the third breast is a wearable prosthetic, especially as Tridevil once reported a '3 breast prosthesis' stolen when her bags went missing at Tampa Airport in 2014 . Proof at last: Body heat pictures through a simple thermal imaging camera. Red indicates normal body temperature due to blood flow. Blue means no blood flow - and there is none at the 'third breast' Uncovered: German television journalist Hans Huebner (right) took the footage showing how the third breast could not actually be a real one . A surgically implanted third breast – which she claims to have forked out $20,000 for - would have blood circulating around it. But as these video stills show the breast in the middle is blue, a sign that there's no heat in this area, while the rest of her body is warm red. The images were shot by German TV network RTL during an interview in October last year. RTL's Miami based producer and investigative reporter Hans Huebner told Daily Mail Online that Hessler's fake breast is simply a hoax designed to boost her chances of becoming a reality TV star. 'These images are absolute proof that Jasmine Tridevil is a liar, we exposed her as a fake,' he said. 'We scheduled an interview with Jasmine in October last year but we were obviously skeptical as to whether her claims were genuine. 'Every plastic surgeon in the world was saying that they wouldn't do this type of surgery. 'So we discussed how we would shoot the interview and we came up with the idea of renting a thermal camera. 'My cameraman went to Home Depot and rented a Thermal Imaging Camera for $100. 'He filmed the interview as normal but secretly used the thermal camera as well.' During the interview Huebner said he pressed Hessler on the truth to her claims. Questionable: Jasmine Tridevil claimed: 'I know my breasts are real and I do not care what anybody thinks.' Before and after: Tridevil pictured at the age of 16 (left) and more recently (right) after what she claims is surgery but which is today exposed as a fake . 'She insisted it was genuine but by the end she cut the interview short, she didn't like my questions and got angry,' said Huebner. 'She said, 'this interview is over' and walked out.' Huebner said that after the interview aired on RTL – Europe's largest domestic television network - he received a 'nasty' email from Hessler. 'She sent me this nasty email saying it was us who were faking it,' he said. After Hessler's story broke last year many commentators claimed the third breast was a wearable prosthetic - especially as she reported a 'three breast prosthesis' stolen when her bags went missing at Tampa Airport in 2014. But Hessler continued to stand firm claiming it was a real implant. In an interview last week she said: 'Getting a third breast was not always my plan - I just had the idea two years ago. 'People always have something to say. They will criticize it or will love it and ask for a picture.' Hessler admits not all the attention she gets is complimentary, adding: 'If I go to a park where there are children, parents will give me dirty looks. 'But if I go to a bar it seems like everybody loves it.' Hessler insists she was rejected by more than 50 doctors who feared violating ethical codes before she found a willing surgeon who would perform the procedure. She says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements. Now, she has hired a camera crew to follow her around Tampa, Florida, documenting the 'struggles' she faces as a three-breasted woman. While the procedure is possible, surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity'. The ethical code outlined by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.' Cosmetic surgeons are under strict guidelines to solely 'enhance the norm' of a patient's body.","Jasmine Tridevil has become a phenomenon through claims she had third breast implanted in surgical procedure .

"Hair on 2,000-year-old mummies has helped reveal what Paracas people in Peru ate in the weeks before their death. A team of archaeologists used the remarkably well-preserved strands to study the diets of 14 individuals unearthed at the Paracas Necropolis of Wari Kayan. During the last months of their lives, they appear to have eaten primarily fish and plants, such as corn and beans. Hair on 2,000-year-old mummies has helped reveal what ancient people in Peru ate in the weeks before their death. During the last months of their lives, the Paracas individuals appear to have eaten primarily marine products and plants, such as maize and beans . Professor Kelly Knudson at Arizona State University made the discovery after focusing on carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of keratin in the hair. Animals that are high on the food chain tend to have high nitrogen isotope values, according to a report in Live Science. Nitrogen isotope values in seawater and sea plants tend to be greater than those on land. The scientists also looked at the type and number of carbon isotopes. Most plants, such as legumes and fruits, make C3, while a corn produces C4. The numbers indicate different ways plants photosynthesise energy from the sun. The research conclude the mummies ate a mixed diet of both C3 and C4 plants. Archaeologists used the ancient strands of hair to study the diets of 14 individuals unearthed at the Paracas Necropolis of Wari Kayan. Paracas comes from the Quechua word para-ako meaning ‘sand falling like rain . 'By using small samples of hair from these mummies, we can learn what they ate in the months and weeks before they died, which is a very intimate look at the past,' said Professor Knudson. Human hair grows slowly and around 0.4 inches (1cm) represents four weeks of a person's life, the researchers claim. The team said their diet not only provides insight into health, but also indicates where people lived and travelled, as well as offer clues about their daily lives. They were also either geographically stable or, if they travelled between the inland highlands and coastal regions, continued to consume fish. 'What is exciting to me about this research is that we are using new scientific techniques to learn more about mummies that were excavated almost 100 years ago,' said Professor Knudson. 'It is a great application of new science to older museum collections.' The Paracas culture was an Andean society that existed between approximately 800 BCE and 100 BCE.

They had an in-depth knowledge of irrigation and water management and made stunning contributions in the textile arts. When the Paracas Necropolis was first discovered in 1927 by Peruvian archaeologist Julio Tello, each mummy was bound in a seated position; found with burial items, like baskets or weapons; and wrapped in a cone-shaped bundle of textiles, including finely embroidered garments. Since the sampled individuals were mostly male, Professor Knudson suggests that future research may involve more females and youths. The researchers also plan to further examine artefacts and mortuary evidence to build context for data on the Paracas people's diet. Careful not to damage the well-preserved body of the woman, archaeologists have kept her in the same state . More than 1,000 years ago, this 50-year-old woman was laid to rest in a ceremonial ritual in the ancient settlement of Pachacamac, near Lima, Peru. The mummified skeleton, which was found in a vast burial site just yards from the long-abandoned civilisation's temple, was discovered in a foetal position. Careful not to damage the well-preserved body of the woman, archaeologists have kept her in the same state she was found in. The mummy was revealed to the public at the Musee de Confluences, in Lyon, in December. More than 80 skeletons and mummies - including infants who appeared to have been killed for ritual reasons - were also found in a spectacular 1,000-year-old tomb at the site in 2012. Beyond these bodies, a further 70 skeletons and mummies - all in the fetal position - were lying around, most of them still wrapped up. The thousands who lived in the ancient town, which existed between the years 800 and 1450, followed the god Pacha Kamaq - who they believed created the first man and first woman. The townsfolk, who built 17 pyramids, merged with the Incas as they conquered much of South America.","Scientists studied diets of 14 mummies found at the Paracas Necropolis .

"Disgraced Alex Rodriguez reported for a New York Yankees pre-season training camp two days early and apologized for taking performance-enhancing drugs that led to him being banned for an entire season. The 39-year-old slugger took his physical and worked out at the Yankees pre-season training complex in Florida, two days before the squad was due to report back. His impromptu practice came three days ahead of the first scheduled team workout and he faced a flurry of media questions before the arrival of his team mates. Alex Rodriguez is put through his paces after reporting early for New York Yankees pre-season training in Florida . The 39-year-old is preparing for his comeback after being banned for an entire season as a result of taking performance-enhancing drugs . His impromptu practice came three days ahead of the first scheduled team workout at the minor league facility in Tampa . 'A-Rod' was among more than a dozen players suspended last year as a result of the Biogensis clinic scandal, which saw steroids and human growth hormone distributed to players. He received the longest ban, in part because of an attempt to impede a Major League Baseball investigation into the matter. He told reporters at the camp in Tampa: 'Obviously it was a rough year. I'm excited that's behind me. 'Right now I'm just focused on making this team. I'm here early to get a jump start. I'm confident if I stay healthy I can do some good things. 'A-Rod' was among more than a dozen players suspended last year as a result of the Biogensis clinic scandal, which saw steroids and human growth hormone distributed to players . Rodriguez shakes hands with some of the Yankees' coaches after finishing his batting practice. He missed the entire 2014 season due to a drugs ban . 'I made a mistake. I served a big penalty personally and professionally. 'I served the time. I tried to use the time productively. I paid my penalty. I'm moving on and focusing on 2015. 'There were plenty of mistakes in a lot of ways. I cringe sometimes when I look at the things I did. No mistake that I made has any good answer or justification. 'I've created a big headache for a lot of people so I don't blame whoever is mad at me.' Rodriguez, a three-time American League Most Valuable Player, was originally given a 211-game ban but it was later reduced to 162 games, the entire 2014 campaign. Rodriguez said the layoff might help his fitness by not putting his body through a season or risking injury. Rodriguez, a three-time American League Most Valuable Player, was given a 162 game ban, the longest after an attempt to impede a Major League Baseball investigation into the drugs matter . When he went to enter the facility in Tampa, Florida, the sportsman was surrounded by fans and waiting reporters and photographers . He told the media gathered at the training ground ''I made a mistake. I served a big penalty personally and professionally' He added: 'The time off has benefitted me. I feel healthy and ready to go. 'It's the first time I get a full year off and get to train instead of rehab. 'It's going to take some time for me. I haven't faced live pitching in a long time. It's one of the hardest things to do in sports. We'll see how it goes. I'm up for the challenge.' Last week, Rodriguez issued an open letter of apology to fans, teammates, the Yankees and Major League Baseball for his actions as he begins to try and work his way back onto a team that he helped to a World Series crown in 2009. A Yankees fan, who had been waiting at the training facility shakes hands with Rodriguez after he signs her ball . A young supporter in Yankees uniform gets his baseball signed by Rodriguez after finishing his pre-season workout . The Yankees set to pay him $61 million over the next three seasons and manager Joe Girardi is expected to evaluate how well he can play at other fielding positions and designated hitter. He added: 'I'm willing to try whatever Joe wants me to try. It's a process. It's going to take some time. I'm going to put in a lot of work. 'Winning a world championship. That's the best-case scenario. That's why we're all here. 'And the worst-case scenario? ""Not winning a world championship.' Although his achievements have been tainted by admissions of doping both recently and more than a decade ago for Texas, Rodriguez has 654 career home runs, six shy of Willie Mays for fourth on Major League Baseball's all-time homers list and 108 off the record 762 hit by Barry Bonds.","Alex Rodriguez shows up for Yankees pre-season training two days early .

"A sophisticated tunnel has been discovered near a major sports venue and a university in Toronto, sparking new terror fears as Canada remains on edge over the threat of possible extremist attacks. A municipal worker was walking through woods close to the city's Rexall Centre last month when he spotted a piece of corrugated metal on the ground, the public broadcaster CBC said on Monday. After lifting up the metal, he uncovered the passageway, also situated near York University. It was around seven meters (23 feet) long, 2.5 meters (eight feet) tall, and was lit by an electric generator. The walls and ceilings had been reinforced and tools had been left inside.

A recent video by the Al-Qaeda-linked Shebab insurgent group has also raised tensions. In it a masked man threatened Canada's massive West Edmonton Mall, along with a mall in the United States and a major shopping district in Britain. Shebab carried out a bloody attack and takeover of a mall in Nairobi in September 2013 that killed at least 67 people. In a video distributed on Twitter Saturday, the group ran a documentary-style account of the Kenya attack. It was followed by an appearance by a masked fighter who suggested similar attacks could be carried out on other malls in the United States, Canada, Britain and France.

Toronto is hosting the Pan American Games in July . 'If just a handful of mujahideen fighters could bring Kenya to a complete stand-still for nearly a week, just imagine what the dedicated mujahideen could do in the West to American or Jewish shopping centers across the world,' the militant said. 'What if such an attack were to occur in the Mall of America in Minnesota? Or the West Edmonton Mall in Canada? Or in London's Oxford Street?' he said. The video was picked up by SITE, a group that monitors jihadist websites. The Mall of America, located in Minnesota and reputedly the country's largest with 40 million visitors a year, said it had taken extra security measures in response to the threat by the Shebab, a Somalia-based insurgent group. The Mall of America (pictured), located in Minnesota and reputedly the country's largest with 40 million visitors a year, said it had taken extra security measures in response to the threat by the Shebab . 'Enhanced security measures to include additional personnel have been implemented and all information is being monitored,' said the police department for Bloomington, the Minneapolis-St Paul suburb where the shopping center is located. 'At this time, there is no credible threat associated with Mall of America,' it said, adding that the facility was a 'very safe place'. Johnson said the threat was indicative of a new type of homegrown threat and requires careful tracking of people suspected of supporting militant groups.

The 50-year-old man repeatedly apologised after being confronted and Mr Paterson said that's when he noticed he smelt of alcohol and had a stash of bottles filled with vodka. Flight attendants were notified and the alcohol was confiscated, but Mr Patterson said the man was quick to grab another bottle of vodka from the overhead locker. 'The man then started to make me feel very uncomfortable by staring at me and talking to me in an aggressive nature in Japanese,' he said. Cabin crew confiscated the second bottle of alcohol and the man reportedly became aggressive.

"Bristol-based designers have created a concept 3D printer that combines facial recognition with a hot plate and layers of batter (concept illustrated) Forget selfies burnt into toast and marshmallows printed with your portrait, the next trend will be to have your face immortalised on a pancake. A research and design team has created a concept 3D printer that combines facial recognition with a hot plate and layers of batter to create complex images. And the printing has the capability to be perfectly timed using algorithms so the lighter and darker tones of the face are captured, and cooked, with precision. The idea was developed by research and innovation experts at Bristol-based Kinneir Dufort. It uses Computer Numerical Control (CNC) technology to convert online designs into numbers, similar to coordinates on a graph. This is combined with embedded face recognition and tracking software to 'print' layers of batter directly onto a hot plate. In particular, the concept technology uses a digital camera combined with image processing libraries to perform face tracking and extraction. Kinneir Dufort has developed bespoke software that is capable of turning this into contours for the batter dispenser. The darkest areas would be deposited first, through four distinct shades to the lightest areas. Once applied to the hot plate, the batter would start to cook and change colour meaning that as subsequent layers were laid down, the printer would add different tones to the image. The firm said: 'Achieving the perfect result is a delicate balance between batter viscosity, speed of application and maintaining the correct temperature on the plate. And prototyping director Ian Hollister added: 'The real challenge was to create a program that enables the picture to be completed from start to finish within the exact timescale for the overall pancake to cook. 'Too little time and the darker tones wouldn’t be achieved, too long and the pancake would burn.' The concept uses Computer Numerical Control (CNC) technology to convert online designs into numbers, similar to coordinates on a graph. Dubbed 'interactive eating experience', the machine is currently a tongue-in-cheek concept but the firm told MailOnline the technology (mock-up example illustrated) is possible . Dubbed 'interactive eating experience', the technology is currently a tongue-in-cheek concept but the firm told MailOnline the machine is possible. 'All of the 3D printing of food will be possible soon; we are just dipping our toes in the water in relation to the capabilities,' explained Bronwen Rolls from Kinneir Dufort. 'We can create the software, we could create final product eventually, but at this moment we are very much at the conceptual stages. 'Our next field of interest is how we can take chocolate and sugar and work with them as they are potentially a more interesting candidate to work with as they could yield greater structural qualities. 'Why stop at the pancake and faces, we could one day print chocolate forms of whole heads?' Miguel Valenzuela, from Oslo, Norway, recently built a 3D pancake printer using Lego called PancakeBot. The father-of-two wrote on an Indiegogo page that his unique invention was inspired by his daughters, and he built the contraption to help inspire children to become interested in engineering. The original idea came in 2010 after Mr Valenzuela read about a British designer who created a pancake stamping machine also made out of the plastic bricks.

"Allegations: Ellen Pao is suing the firm Keliner, Perkins, Caulfied and Byers, claiming she was subjected to discrimination after she broke off an affair with a male colleague . Reddit's chief executive his set to testify in a trial against her former employers, claiming she was harassed after ending a relationship with a married colleague and was the victim of a male dominated culture. Ellen Pao, 45, has accused Silicon Valley firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers of discriminating against her and creating an environment where female colleagues were urged not to complain. Pao claims she was pressured into having sex with a co-worker who is believed to have had a strong influence over the way Kleiner partners viewed her. After she ended the relationship, Pao claims he retaliated against her for five years. She was excluded from important meetings, email chains and company dinners because women 'kill the buzz' of such festive occasions, according to the lawsuit. Kleiner fired Pao in 2012 - six months after she filed her lawsuit. Pao claims she was forced out because of her discrimination complaints. The firm counters that she was let go because of poor performance. The firm had hired her in 2005 to serve as chief of staff for senior partner John Doerr. He helped direct early investments in Google, Amazon and a long-list of successful technology companies. Doerr is a Google board member and serves on President Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Pao holds an undergraduate degree from Princeton University and graduated from the Harvard University law and business schools. Her lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but during a court hearing on February 2, a lawyer for Kleiner told a judge that Pao is seeking $16 million for back pay and future wages lost. The firm is seeking to limit any possible damages by arguing that Pao is well-compensated in her current position as interim CEO of the popular social media company Reddit and hasn't suffered financially since leaving Kleiner after filing her lawsuit. The firm denies Pao's accusations and defends its record with women employees. They say that her affair was consensual and Pao never complained about the conduct of her colleague until she hired a lawyer five years later. The firm insists she was let go because she clashed with co-workers and didn't like her job. Menlo Park-based Kleiner, Perkins did not submit the case to an arbitrator to decide behind closed doors and has made it clear in court filings that it intends to paint Pao as an unpopular underperformer often caught up in office drama who was paid more than many of her male peers. Beginning of the case: Pao (right) and attorney Alan Axelrod walk to their courtroom before the start of her trial at San Francisco Superior Court, California . 'For some reason, there's always some team controversy swirling around Ellen,' one of her annual reviews stated, according to a court filing by the firm. 'At any moment in time, Ellen is not getting along with someone. 'This case is a wakeup call,' said longtime Stanford University law professor Deborah Rhode, who teaches gender equity law. 'The case has sparked a much-needed debate about gender inequality regardless of its merit.' Opening statements are expected to start Tuesday and the trial is expected to last four weeks in San Francisco Superior Court. Rebutall: The firm denies Pao's (pictured at court) accusations and defends its record with women employees . Women hold 15 percent to 20 percent of the technology jobs at tech giants Google, Apple, Facebook and Yahoo, according to company disclosures. The companies acknowledge needing to do more to hire female engineers but largely attribute the problem to cultural issues that discourage girls and young women from taking classes needed to pursue careers in computer coding and website design. Venture capital firms are even more slanted toward men. A 2011 survey by the National Venture Capital Association found women accounted for 11 percent of investors. A study released last year by Babson College in Massachusetts found that women filled just six percent of the partner-level positions at 139 venture capital firms in 2013, down from 10 percent in 1999.

I couldn't buy a house in Sydney so I bought one in the Central Coast but I didn't have any money to do anything to it,' she said. 'Thank you,' Ms Reid, who entered the competition 22 times, could be heard stammering before breaking down into tears . Joined by her younger daughter Breanna and son Brodie in the background, Ms Reid revealed that the lucky day fell right on her 15-year-old daughter's birthday before adding 'she can have anything she wants for her birthday now' She said the money will allow her to travel to Sydney to visit her eldest children and her newborn grandchild . 'The plumbing in my en-suite has been broken for the last two and a half years, the faucet in the kitchen sink is really loose, my neighbour wants to put colour bond fences in and I can't afford that - well I can now! 'My eldest kids and grandkids live in Sydney and I haven't been able to visit them so now I can! 'My eldest daughter just had a second baby so I can see them now - I can really do a lot, it's really life changing.' The single mother revealed that a holiday was also in order, admitting that she hadn't been away since 1998 with her mother. Ms Reid (left with her first grandchild) explained that the money would mostly go towards perfecting her family home, saying she only just managed to buy the property with the money her late mother (right) had left her . Aside from paying off some bills, Today revealed that the sum of $100,000 could buy a single diamond ring from Tiffany & Co. or a particularly flashy Porsche. Otherwise it can buy 66 television screens, 66 pairs of Loui Vuitton shoes, 25,000 cups of coffee, 115 iPhone 6s or five first class trips around the world .

"Scientists have warned  massive agricultural expansion in Tanzania could lead to a 'perfect storm' for human plague transmission by encouraging an increase in the number of disease-carrying rats. A new study published yesterday in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene by researchers from the University of California found that the expansion of crop lands by 70 per cent over recent years has caused the number of plague-carrying rodents to double. Rats which live in human areas are also particularly competent hosts for plague and are more likely to interact with humans, increasing the chance of humans being bitten by plague-infected fleas. Scroll down for video . A study  found the expansion of croplands  in Tanzania has caused the number of disease-carrying rats to double in recent years - increasing the chance of humans being bitten by plague-infected fleas . In the report scientists linked an increase in corn fields – necessary to feed an expanding population – to a 20-fold rise in the population of African rats in northern Tanzania. These rats transmit deadly diseases to humans, including Lassa fever and plague. Hillary Young, a University of California professor and a lead author of the study, said: 'We found that introducing maize production in natural areas appears to create a perfect storm for plague transmission. 'Local farmers often then store this harvested corn next to or inside their homes - baiting in the hungry field rats and increasing opportunities for human infection. 'These kinds of conditions are what breed outbreaks.' The report warned these numbers could rise as new wilderness areas become farmland and rat populations increase. Though less deadly than Ebola or other epidemics, plague – caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis is fatal in more than 30 percent of cases if left untreated, the study said. The bubonic plague remains one of the most destructive pandemics in history which peaked in Europe between 1348 and 1350 . As Africa's population soars, and food demand increases, scientists, farmers and politicians will have to balance the need for more farmland with concerns over the spread of disease, the scientists added. Most of the plague outbreaks recorded since 2000 have taken place in Africa. A recent outbreak in Madagascar saw 263 people infected and 71 deaths. In Tanzania, there have been over 8,000 cases over the last 30 years, including 675 deaths, The International Business Times reported. The scientists studied three areas of northern Tanzania where plague outbreaks have been documented in the past and where maize production has expanded over recent times. Concluding, the authors said: 'Lessons learned from this case are also broadly important for understanding the dynamics of other zoonotic diseases in this era of rapid landscape change.' Bubonic plague is one of the most devastating diseases in history, having killed around 100million people during the 'Black Death' in the 14th century.Drawings and paintings from the outbreak, which wiped out about a third of the European population, depict town criers saying 'bring out your dead' while dragging trailers piled with infected corpses. It is caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia pestis, which uses the flea as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats. The disease causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance of large swellings on the groin, armpits or neck, known as 'buboes'. It kills up to two thirds of sufferers within just four days if it is not treated, although if antibiotics are administered within 24 hours of infection patients are highly likely to survive. After the Black Death arrived in 1347 plague became a common phenomenon in Europe, with outbreaks recurring regularly until the 18th century. Bubonic plague has almost completely vanished from the rich world, with 90 per cent of all cases now found in Africa. However, there have been a few non-fatal cases in the U.S. in recent years, while in August 2013 a 15-year-old boy died in Kyrgyzstan after eating a groundhog infected with the disease. Three months later, an outbreak in a Madagascan killed at least 20 people in a week. A year before 60 people died as a result of the infection, more than in any other country in the world. Outbreaks in China have been rare in recent years, and most have happened in remote rural areas of the west. China's state broadcaster said there were 12 diagnosed cases and three deaths in the province of Qinghai in 2009, and one in Sichuan in 2012. In the United States between five and 15 people die every year as a result, mostly in western states.","Expansion of crops has caused 20-fold increase in population of African rat .

"Greece has been forced subject itself to a number of austerity measures in order to get a four-month extension to its bailout, despite an election promise not to compromise. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his left-wing Syriza party swept to victory in the general election last month after promising to end the austerity measures imposed by the eurozone. Greece's reform plan, which was approved by its EU creditors today, backed down on key leftist measures and promised that spending to alleviate social distress would not derail its budget to repay the €240billion bailout deal. Change of plans: Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, pictured today, has been forced to go back on his election promise to end austerity measures implicated by the eurozone, in order to extend the bailout . Mr  Tsipras based his election campaign on a pledge to renegotiate the bailout deal and reverse many of the reforms that eurozone creditors demanded in exchange for keeping Greece financially afloat since 2010. Just last week, Mr Tsipras was ignoring calls from across Europe to compromise on the plan to extend the bailout and promised the electorate that Athens would not climb down from its pre-election pledges. 'We are not in a hurry and we will not compromise,' Mr Tsipras told his party's lawmakers in parliament last week. 'We are working hard for an honest and mutually beneficial deal, a deal without austerity, without the bailout which has destroyed Greece in recent years, a deal without the toxic presence of the (bailout inspecting) troika.' He also promised that a labour bill which had previously been scrapped by EU and International Monetary Fund lenders, would soon be presented alongside another one to deal with the 'humanitarian crisis' in Greece, he said. Backing down: Just last week, Mr Tsipras, leader of the left-wing Syriza party, promised the Greek parliament that Athens would not climb down from its pre-election pledges . Despite these promises to his parliament last week, Mr Tsipras has been forced to concede defeat and undertake a list of reforms to prevent Greek from possible bankruptcy. In its list of reforms, the Greek government pledges not to roll back any privatizations that have already been completed and to 'respect the process, according to the law,' of any tenders that have already been launched. Privatization was one of the elements of Greece's bailout that Mr Tsipras' Syriza party had promised to cancel. It has also promised to combat tax evasion and corruption, reduce bureaucracy, review public spending, modernize the pension system, reform the judicial system and address rising poverty through measures that have 'no fiscal effect.' The letter is a general outline of policies and does not include any figures or specific details on how the policies will be achieved. Greece's creditors in the 19-country eurozone, the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, approved the list of reforms on Tuesday. The approval of Greece's list of proposed reforms came following a meeting by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs at the European Parliament in Brussels on Tuesday . 'The three institutions agreed to start the process with this. They thought it was a serious enough list and all the countries have just agreed with that in the meeting so we can start,' said eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem on RTL television. Though the reform measures were welcomed, the eurozone ministers said Greece had to take further steps to flesh out the details. 'We call on the Greek authorities to further develop and broaden the list of reform measure,' the eurozone said in a statement. So far, the reform list 'is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point,' EU Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici wrote. 'We are encouraged by the commitment to combat tax evasion and corruption ... as well as to pursue reforms to modernize the public administration.' Moscovici said he would work 'with the new administration to elaborate what are at the moment still general commitments and transform these into clear policy actions.'","Greece's list of austerity reforms approved by eurozone creditors .

"A British teacher who went on to become the Grand Master of the Order of Malta has taken the first step towards becoming a saint. The Vatican have officially opened a cause for the sainthood for Andrew Bertie, a distant cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, who died in Rome in 2008. Bertie was the first Englishman to be elected to the post of Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, which comes with the title of prince and is equivalent to a cardinal, in the Order's 900 year history. He will now be known as a Servant of God. But to become a saint it must now be shown that he demonstrated ‘heroic virtue’ during his life. Honour: Andrew Bertie (pictured with Pope Benedict XVI) was the first Englishman to be elected to the post of Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, which comes with the title of prince and is equivalent to a cardinal . Mission: Andrew Bertie (pictured with Pope John Paul II) will now be known as a Servant of God. But to become a saint it must now be shown that he demonstrated ‘heroic virtue’ during his life . In order to become a saint, two miracles attributable to him would have to be found. Bertie reformed the order recognising the importance of its diplomatic corp and built up the numbers of their humanitarian ambassadors. He founded the order of young volunteers in the UK. Friends say he showed signs of heroic virtue, one of the primary requirements for sainthood, and led an 'exemplary' life. Matthew Festing, the current Grad Master said: 'His personality was quiet –that famous British reserve! – but he had a natural authority and a serenity deeply rooted in his Christian beliefs. He also had a fine sense of humour – a quiet amusement at the ridiculousness of much of life. 'Those who were privileged to have worked around him were always aware of his calmness and his profound faith,' he added. Taking the first step: The Vatican - headed by Pope Francis - has officially opened a cause for the sainthood for Andrew Bertie, a distant cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, who died in 2008 . Talks: Andrew Bertie (pictured right and left with Cuban leader Fidel Castro) reformed the Knights of Malta, recognising the importance of its diplomatic corp and built up the number of humanitarian ambassadors . Friends said he would be ‘gasping’ if he knew he was on track for sainthood. 'His modesty would find it difficult to cope with,' one said. Ampleforth and Oxford-educated Bertie taught languages at Worth school after a spell as a journalist and in the army. He joined the Knights of Malta in 1956 and then, in 1981, became a professed Knight, living under solemn vows of poverty chastity and obedience. He would regularly tend to the sick himself he and was even known to work anonymously in a Rome hospital as a ward orderly, according to friends. Bertie was on his father’s side a grandson of the 7th Earl of Abingdon, and on his mother’s, of the Marquess of Bute - a direct descendant of the Stuart line of monarchs.","Andrew Bertie was the first Englishman to be elected to the post of Grand Master of the Knights of Malta .

"With DNA and computer records, policing has come a long way in the last century. But one thing remains eerily similar - the humble mugshot. These 1880s photographs were among the first of their kind, showing a host of sepia-printed criminals staring into the camera and holding up their hands to show tattoos or missing digits. Inspired by the work of French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon, who was the first to take 'standardised' photographs so convicts could be told apart, the images feature in a new exhibition which documents our fascination with forensic science. Scroll down for video . Eerie: These mugshots, taken from 1883 to 1889 at an unknown prison, are among the first of their kind. The technique of standardising photos - with similar clothes and background to spot distinguishing features - was pioneered by the French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon . Flip book: An photofit book from 1970 provided by the Metropolitan Police. In 1938 Jacques Penry, a facial topographer, began to develop a system of illustrations to identify facial features, which later became a bank of photographic images used to help witnesses record the details of suspects. This system replaced the ‘Identikit’ that used line drawings on overlaid acetate sheets, and gradually expanded as more police forces introduced the system. For instance, the selection of white male features comprised 204 different foreheads and hairstyles . Cracked: The fractured skull of a murder victim who suffered repeated blows with a blunt instrument sometime in the 1960s and reconstructed . Behind every crime is a trail of evidence, of shattered bones, bloodied tiles, empty shell casings, of sketches and mugshots. Physical remnants of foul deeds, waiting to be found and pieced together to convict the guilty. This is the stuff of forensic science, and now the exhibition in central London has honed in on the fascination by showcasing a collection of original evidence, footage and instruments from real cases throughout history. 'Forensics: The Anatomy of Crime', which opens at the Wellcome Collection this week, includes the shattered skull of a murder victim, a brain damaged by bullet holes and a floor where a murdered man was found. Visitors are also able to walk into a working mortuary fridge, read original autopsy index cards and view a bullet used in a suicidal shooting - as well as the fatal wound it caused. In one installation, visitors will be confronted with the sounds from an autopsy of a murder victim and view the tools used by pathologists. The spring exhibition also features sketches from the site of a murder attributed to Jack the Ripper as well as authentic weapons used in a murder. Skeleton: These bones are from an installation by Jenny Holzer named Lustmord, which means sexual murder involving rape in German. It consists of 312 bones and 33 engraved with silver rings engraved with lines from a text and present three perspectives on sexual violence: those of the perpetrator, the victim and observer. They were made during the conflict in Yugoslavia and signify the acute physical and psychological damage caused by major war crimes and human rights abuses in 1994 . Crime scene: These 105 ceramic tiles and concrete floor was the site of the murder of Luis Miguel Suro, the artist friend of Teresa Margolles - who spent several years working the morgue in Mexico City and is concerned with the consequences of widespread violence in Mexico. He was murdered Guadalajara, Mexico in 2004, but the motive is not known . These two sections of human brain (left) are from a young man who committed suicide by shooting himself through the temple. He lived for two days but died from his injuries in the 1960s. The specimens show that the bullet created a blood track through both brain hemispheres, causing associated haemorrhage. The skull (right) is one of the many authentic human remains on display at the forensic exhibition in London . This exhibit shows the bullet from a suicide shot and the flesh wound (inside box, left) in the 1960s. When a bullet passes through the body, heat from the gun’s discharge causes cauterisation, creating blackened area around the wound. The two segments of scalp show the entry and exit wounds, along with the offending bullet, which passed through the man’s head and subsequently became lodged in a nearby wall. The large-calibre bullet (0.455) was fired from a Webley MK VI service revolver . Mexican artist Teresa Margolles has displayed a section of the tiled floor on which her close friend was found murdered. The crime scene 'signifies the absence of the person and emphasises loss', according to the Wellcome Collection. The gallery is divided into five sections including 'The Crime Scene', which investigates the different techniques of recording the location of a crime and its power both as a repository of evidence to be examined and a haunting site of memory. This department also includes the work of Mr Bertillon, whose 'God's Eye View' format, taken from above, brought rigour to the field. He also standardised the method of taking the criminal's photograph face on and in profile, which would be added to their file card. Ken Arnold, head of public programmes at the Wellcome Collection, which recently underwent a £17.5million said: 'Forensics reminds us of the human body's extraordinary capacity to leave traces beyond death and disappearance. Visitors are also able to walk into a mortuary fridge, part of an artwork by Sejla Kameric exploring the missing victims of the Bosnian war of 1992-5. They can also hear the sounds from a real life autopsy and view tools used by pathologists . 'Forensics: The Anatomy of Crime' opens at the Wellcome Collection this week and includes this working morgue refrigerator. From a space for viewing corpses in Paris (the word morgue comes from morguer, ‘to peer’) to the virtual autopsies afforded by MRI, CT and 3D scanning, the morgue offers a vital space for questioning the dead . These forensic instruments would have once been used in post-mortems but are now on display for the public in a free exhibition on Friday . The display allows members of the public to see first hand the evidence from what happens after a victim dies, to how the perpetrator is caught . 'This unsettling truth is both the focus of an astonishing range of scientific enquiry and fertile territory for the cultural imagination.' Lucy Shanahan, curator, said: 'This exhibition gives alternative views of the forensic process from the CSI detections of popular fiction and television, whilst exploring the cultural fascination that the disciplines of forensic medicine inspire. 'Our journey from crime scene to courtroom takes in pioneers of scientific techniques that have revolutionised the way in which crimes are investigated, and offers visitors unexpected encounters with the changing relationship between medicine, law and society.' The free exhibition opens Thursday and runs to June 21. These autopsy notes are from celebrity pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury, and have been displayed for the first time at the new exhibition . This book, 'Murder the Result of Various Injuries: Atlas of Legal Medicine', was written by Eduard Rittervon Hofmann in 1898. It explains that in an external examination the surface of the body is inspected and any irregular signs, scars, lesions or abnormalities as a result of disease or trauma are noted. In addition, the appearance of livor mortis – discolouration caused by the settling of blood under the skin – is assessed. Also known as lividity orhypostasis, this transformation is usually apparent half an hour to two hours after death, fully developing within 12 hours . The gallery is divided into five sections including 'The Crime Scene', which investigates the different techniques of recording the location of a crime and its power both as a repository of evidence to be examined and a haunting site of memory . From the Romanforum to the Old Bailey the exhibition closes with the space which brings together themany strands of forensic medicine, either as a conclusion to an investigation, or tocontest previous convictions . The free public gallery opens on Thursday at the Wellcome Collection in central London and will be on display until June 21.

"Wesleyan University's president has urged students to 'turn in the drug dealers' after 12 people - 10 students and two visitors - were hospitalized after taking party drug 'molly'. In a letter to the campus President Michael Roth said:  'If you are aware of people distributing these substances, please let someone know before more people are hurt.' The school became aware of the problem early on Sunday morning after several students showed up seeking treatment at a Middlesex Hospital near the campus. The president of Wesleyan University (pictured) has urged students to 'turn in the drug dealers' following a rash of hospitalizations among people who took a party drug known as molly over the weekend . In his letter Roth included a telephone number students can call to make a confidential report. 'These drugs can be altered in ways that make them all the more toxic. Take a stand to protect your fellow students,' he wrote. Two students were described as being in a critical condition and were airlifted for treatment in Hartford, 20 miles north of the campus in Middletown. Two others were taken by ambulance to Hartford Hospital in a serious condition and four more were expected to be released from Middlesex yesterday, Roth said. Molly is a term used to describe a refined form of Ecstasy, a synthetic drug also known as MDMA. It can drive up body temperature and cause liver, kidney or cardiovascular failure. Dr. Mark Neavyn, chief of toxicology at Hartford Hospital, said users who believe they are taking molly are often receiving different kinds of designer drugs with ranges of purity and potency making the health risks unpredictable. He said testing is underway to confirm what drugs the Wesleyan patients took. 'When we see these people in the emergency department and they claim to have taken molly, we don't pay attention to that word anymore. Molly is a term used to describe a refined form of Ecstasy, a synthetic drug also known as MDMA . 'It's so commonly not MDMA, we just start from square one and say it's some sort of drug abuse,' Neavyn said. Wesleyan health officials said in a campus-wide email on September 16 that students had been hospitalized  after taking molly. Students were urged to visit the school's health center if they had questions or concerns. Some of the students who required medical attention over the weekend had attended a rave at the school's Eclectic Society social house. Middletown police Chief William McKenna said his department was pursing information about a 'bad batch' of the drug. 'Our first and foremost goal is to obtain information on the batch of Molly that was distributed to the students on the campus,' McKenna said. 'This information is critical in ensuring the recovery of those students affected.' The school's administration have asked students  to check on their friends and make sure they aren't in danger. In the last five years molly has made its way into popular culture, helped by references to it by entertainers such as Madonna, Miley Cyrus and Kanye West. The drug's dangers became more clear after a rash of overdoses in recent years. Over the last few years, drugs sold under the name molly have 'flooded' the market, said Rusty Payne, a spokesman with the Drug Enforcement Administration. In some states there has been a 100-fold increase - the combined number of arrests, seizures, emergency room mentions and overdoses - between 2009 and 2012, according to DEA figures. The drug is marketed to recreational drug users who believe it is less dangerous than its predecessor, which was often cut with other substances. A total of 12 people - 10 Wesleyan students and two visitors - received medical attention over the weekend after taking what id believed to be party drug Molly. Police believe a bad batch may be in circulation .","So far 12 people have been hospitalised - 10 students and two visitors .

"A father-of-three was so angry that his teenage daughter had defied his rules about going on social media sites and then had etched the name of a boy she met online on her arm that he ordered she remove it with a heated knife. The 45-year-old beat his daughter with a belt, striking her in the face and on the arms and legs after he discovered the 14-year-old from Solihull had met a boy on Facebook and become so infatuated she used a pin to scrawl his name on her arm in a makeshift tattoo. The 'zealous' assault was only discovered when a teacher at the girl's school noticed her injuries. When asked about the incident the father still did not understand what he had done wrong. A 14-year-old girl was beaten with a belt by her father after he discovered she had defied his orders to go on Facebook, and had met a boy online and etched his name on her arm. The man ordered her to remove the makeshift tattoo with a hot knife and was given a suspended prison sentence after admitting child cruelty . He admitted a charge of child cruelty and was given a six month suspended sentence. Birmingham Crown Court heard that the child, who cannot be named, had been banned from using social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter by her father. But she started chatting online with a boy, and was so infatuated that she used a pin to prick out his name on her arm. Graham Russell, prosecuting, told the court the makeshift tattoo was eventually seen by her mother, who then called her father. Mr Russell said the girl had run upstairs and tried to hold the bedroom door against her father but realised it was futile. After admitting what she had done, her father told his wife to fetch his belt which he then folded in two. Judge James Burbidge said the actions of the father were 'zealous and frankly brutal' in response . 'At that point he began hitting his daughter indiscriminately, the blows landing on her legs, hands and body,' said Mr Russell. During her ordeal, during which she was also struck in the face, the teenager tried to move around on the bed and use a pillow as a shield. But the 'brutal' attack continued, the court was told. The assault only came to light after a teacher at the girl's school was told what had happened, and alerted the police and social services. When later quizzed, the victim's father apologised but said he did not know what he had done wrong. Mark Jones, defending, said the man was now aware that it was wrong, and had seen the effect on his daughter. Judge James Burbidge QC told the 45-year-old father: 'You were responsible for chastising your child in a way that was zealous and frankly brutal. The level of violence that was displayed against her was significant. She was still crying for some considerable time after you struck her many times with a belt. 'She was then clearly in need of medical attention. She had done no more than, no doubt, many a child of her age, falling fond of a particular individual and etching their name on her arm.' He said the man deserved a prison sentence but he knew a custody term would probably harm his children even more. Judge Burbidge sentenced the father to six months, suspended for 18 months, and ordered him to do 80 hours unpaid work. He and his 41-year-old wife had previously both admitted a charge of child cruelty. The mother was handed a one-year community order.","A 14-year-old girl from Solihull was banned from using social media sites .

"Prosecutors will not file charges against three Los Angeles police officers who fatally shot an unarmed, disabled veteran on live television after a car chase. Brian Newt Beaird, a 51-year-old disabled National Guard veteran, was struck by 13 bullets in downtown Los Angeles on the night of December 13, 2013. Local news stations carried live pictures of the high-speed police pursuit and its bloody aftermath. One of the people who watched Beaird go down in a hail of bullets was his father. The City Council has approved payment of $5 million to Beaird's family to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit. Three police officers that shot dead unarmed veteran Brian Newt Beaird, pictured, on live TV in December 2013 will not face charges . Brian Beaird (left), 51, was shot 13 times by police after an hour long police chase through Los Angeles. His father, Billy (right), saw his son die live on TV when police opened fire . In a letter dated January 29 obtained by The Associated Press in a public records request, prosecutors wrote that there is insufficient evidence to prove officers didn't act in self-defense or the defense of others when they killed Beaird on December 13, 2013. The officers will be disciplined for their actions after Chief Charlie Beck determined two months ago that they had violated department rules for deadly force and their actions were not reasonable. The officers have been assigned home pending discipline without pay, said Commander Andrew Smith, a department spokesman. Officers Armando Corral, Leonardo Ortiz and Michael Ayala did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but have previously said that they believed that their lives were in danger. Police chased Beaird in his Corvette for nearly an hour, claiming he had been driving erratically . The chase only came to an end when Beaird hit another car, pictured left. The driver suffered serious injuries in the crash and Beaird's car ended up spinning onto a sidewalk . The shooting followed a nearly hour-long nighttime pursuit for allegedly reckless driving that ended when the Corvette hit a car at an intersection, seriously injuring the other driver, and then spun onto a downtown sidewalk. Beaird's father, Billy Beaird, watched live as his son, a National Guard veteran, staggered out of the Corvette, briefly raised his hands, was fatally shot multiple times in the front and back, and fell to the ground. The officers will be disciplined for their actions after Chief Charlie Beck determined two months ago that they had violated department rules for deadly force . The district attorney's office analysis states that because of Beaird's movements, the officers lost sight of his left hand and feared he might be reaching for a weapon. Beaird was shot 13 times and the analysis found that the three fatal gunshots were as he was falling or had fallen to the ground. A coroner's toxicology screen found Beaird had marijuana, methamphetamine and cocaine in his system as well as an antidepressant drug, the document states. The letter cites the chaotic and tense scene, the officers' inability to see his hand and delayed reaction time as factors that defense attorneys could cite had impacted the situation. 'Given the fact that the entire incident from Beaird exiting the car until the shooting ceased lasted less than six seconds, such defense testimony would create reasonable doubt as to whether the officers were unjustified in continuing to shoot after the suspect had turned and even fallen to the ground,' it states. The letter notes that an administrative decision requires a lower standard of proof and that an officer's compelled statements while usable by the department for internal actions cannot be used in criminal prosecution. Beaird was discharged from the National Guard in 1988 after undergoing surgery for a brain tumor and needed regular medical care. The family's attorney, Dale K. Galipo, said he was paranoid at the time of the chase. 'He couldn't understand why the police were chasing him, and he didn't know what to do,"" Galipo said. 'He called his family during the pursuit and asked what he should do. And they told him he should pull over ... and he said ""I'm afraid"" and kept going.'","Prosecutors will not file charges against three LAPD officer who fatally shot an unarmed, disabled veteran on live TV after a car chase .

"A controversial politician who responds to 'hate mail' with profanities has defended his fiery responses, telling Daily Mail Australia he should not have to quietly cop 'obnoxious' abuse. Senator David Leyonhjelm has recently fired back at email correspondents who 'get under his skin', saying one read: 'DILLIGAF' - an acronym which stands for 'Do I Look Like I Give A F***'. It wasn't the first missive containing cursing - in January Mr Leyonhjelm replied to an activist's email referencing Hitler with the response: 'Go f*** yourself you communist turd.' 'If you're polite to me, I'll be polite to you,' said Liberal Democratic Party senator in an interview with Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Outspoken: Senator David Leyonhjelm often fires back at email correspondents who are 'obnoxious' to him . The Senator has caused a stir with his views about guns and animal rights in the past year, causing him to receive extensive amounts of hate mail . 'There's a small group of people out there who think it's their duty to be obnoxious to politicians. 'Some get quite astonished when this politician bites back at them. 'Somehow there's this perception I should just cop it. 'I don't mind people disagreeing with me. I have no problem with that at all. 'It's part and parcel of the job. They can disagree as enthusiastically as they want. 'What I don't have to accept is obnoxious abuse'. The libertarian senator's swearing provoked one email writer  to start a change.org petition questioning the professionalism of his responses. 'This man is a liberal senator not a child - he's a servant of the state - yet this is how he privately talks to his constituents,' wrote animal rights activist Shane Briant, who said he received a sweary email. But the senator said that while he rarely responds with profanities and deletes most 'hate mail', he does not have to report to a major party and can be himself. 'The vast majority of people who send me an email are polite and get a polite response. It doesn't really matter if (I) disagree with them.' 'Very occasionally, very rarely, something is thoroughly obnoxious and it gets under my skin.

'I don't have a party hierarchy to worry about. I don't care what Tony Abbott thinks or Bill Shorten thinks. I can be myself.' The NSW senator was elected at the 2013 Federal election and has stirred debate with his pro-gun position (he believes more Australians should be armed for self defence purposes) and same sex marriage (which he is in favour of). Mr Leyonhjelm said he had received hate mail about both issues. He has stirred controversy more recently with remarks about greyhound live baiting and cricketer Glenn McGrath. Discussing the greyhound scandal with the ABC, he said: 'I think (stopping) cruelty is the argument. We're not interested in shutting down businesses and industries . After pictures emerged of the famous cricketer standing of a dead elephant on a South African hunting trip at the weekend, Mr Leyonhjelm took to Twitter.

"Savings have fallen to a record low as thousands of families fail to put away any money at the end of each month, figures show . Savings have fallen to a record low as thousands of families fail to put away any money at the end of each month, figures show. High house prices and poor wage growth has led to a dramatic fall in the amount that families are saving into pensions, bank accounts and investments. Growing confidence in the economy has also deterred people from savings because they believe their job is secure and their home will grow in value. But experts warned that Britain faced a 'savings crisis' and said many would be left in pension poverty. This year, total households will save just 5.4 per cent of their take-home pay – the lowest percentage since records began 18 years ago. This is just half of the proportion saved in 2010 when households put away 11 per cent of their salary after tax, official figures show. By 2019, this will have plunged further to 4.8 per cent, according to forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility. The International Longevity Centre (ILC), which analysed the data, said Britain was in the middle of 'a lost decade' of savings, which would not end until at least 2020. In 2010, mass redundancies saw savings hit a 12-year high as people squirrelled away their money amid fears they could lose their job. But since then, savings have fallen sharply as people increased their level of credit card debt and taken on larger mortgages. House prices have soared by double digits in many parts of the country, meaning many have large home loans, while below-inflation pay rises have compounded the problem. Experts said last night that such poor savings risked leaving many with an inadequate income in retirement. Ben Franklin, at the ILC, told the Mail: 'People are spending more, rent and house prices have risen, but wages have stagnated. 'We have had a consumption-driven recovery, with people buying more, but without the pay rises accompanying that. 'This means many are struggling to put something away at the end of the month, so they are saving less money into their pension or bank accounts.' Figures show that, on average, employees contributed just 2.9 per cent of their salary into a money purchase pension every month, while those in a gold-plated final salary pensions pay 5.9 per cent. Experts warned that Britain faced a 'savings crisis' and said many would be left in pension poverty . 'For many, this is not enough for an adequate retirement income', Mr Franklin added. 'We have a lost decade of savings which could turn into two or three decades. 'If people do not start saving more, there will be a generation of people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who are significantly worse off in retirement than their parents.' Anna Bowes, of rate tracker website Savings Champion, said workers were deterred from saving by record low interest rates. She said: 'People are looking at the rock-bottom rates and thinking it is not worthwhile to save.' She said there had been a shift away from saving in recent decades, adding: 'For many older generations, there was a savings culture and they were not as keen to get into debt. 'Now, people are in a lot of debt from a young age if they go to university, so they do not get into a habit of saving until much later. 'The fall in savings is a ticking time bomb. 'If people do not save now then what will they do when they reach retirement?'. Auto-enrolment has seen millions of workers automatically entered into a workplace pension in the last three years. In 2012, the Government introduced new rules which forced bosses to pay into a pension for their employees. Steve Webb said that auto-enrolment had helped to reverse a long-term decline in the number of people saving into a pension. He said: 'If you leave it to people [to save themselves] then it isn't go to happen, and that is the point of auto-enrolment.' But he said the drop in savings also symbolised increased confidence in the economy, saying: 'After the 2008 financial crash, people became quite risk adverse and savings went up quite dramatically. 'Now people feel more comfortable and, while they may be saving less, they might be looking at the rising value of their house as an asset.'","Thousands of families fail to put away any money at the end of each month .

"Trawling through the water with a magnet, schoolboy James Cork had only expected a modest haul of scrap metal. But, last week, the 16-year-old from Somerset stumbled across a rather more shocking discovery – a hidden cache of 40 deadly weapons. The arsenal of rusting and grubby guns dating back to the Second World War included a Browning .50 machine gun, which could take down a helicopter, and an M16 assault rifle. An expert has suggested the guns may have belonged to the IRA and could have been dumped when they were meant to be declaring their arms in 2001. A teenage metal detector discovered 40 weapons dumped in the Somerset Levels when trawling the water with a magnet. Some of the guns may have belonged to members of the IRA, experts said . The teenager from Street had taken up the unusual hobby of magnet fishing six months ago, but had only managed to salvage the odd bit of scrap metal. But while combing Greylake on the Somerset Levels with a rope and a strong magnet tied to the end, he and a friend suddenly came across a 40-strong haul of terrifying weapons. In the 1980s weapons and explosives were smuggled across the Irish Sea by the IRA in ferries or small boats. Members chose the most remote areas on England, Wales and Scotland to hide them as they planned to take their fight to the mainland. Sources at the time said that they were then stashed in forests and hills across Stirlingshire and in the Uplands of Scotland. Sites in north Wales were also chosen. In England weapons were also dumped in the Midlands and also all along the south coast, making rural Somerset a likely spot for an arms cache. Among them were parts of a Nazi MG 42 light machine gun, which has a 600m killing range, and a Czech SA23 9mm submachine gun. He told The Sun: ‘I was shocked. I’ve never found anything like this before. There were a few whole weapons, but not many. Some were machine guns, pistols and revolvers. And there was a massive machine gun on a stand. ‘There was a fisherman getting quite angry as I was disturbing the water. But when he saw what I pulled out, he came and helped.’ Though he threw most back into the water, he took one of the guns – thought to be a 1930s Smith & Wesson .38 - home to play with. However when his mum Katherine saw him playing with the gun, she called 999 and an armed police arrived minutes later. The 37-year-old said: ‘Nothing illegal is allowed in the house. ‘But I didn’t think I’d be dealing with one of my kids holding a gun. I said, “Bring it downstairs, leave it in the kitchen and don’t touch it”.’ James Cook, 16, said he had 'never found anything like it before'. A fisherman helped the teenager pull the haul of weapons out of the water . Among the guns was an M16 Rifle dubbed the Widow Maker (top) by British troops fighting the IRA in Ulster . A handout image of the deadly gun used by IRA troops in the battle for Northern Ireland . Another of the weapons found by the teenager is thought to be a Nazi MG 42 used in Germany in the second half of the Second World War (file image) Police dredged the river the next day to recover the rest of the weapons. A spokesman for Avon & Somerset Police said: ‘None of the weapons were complete, and they were extremely rusty and very old. All of the weapon parts have been or are being destroyed.’ An expert suggested that the weapons could have been used by the IRA during The Troubles and may have been dumped when Republicans were meant to be declaring their arms in 2001. Former SAS sergeant and author Andy McNab, who served in Northern Ireland during 1979, said the weapons could have been used by the IRA during The Troubles. He said: ‘This must be a terrorist bundle. That’s because there are weapons for various ranges — from close assassination ones to the Browning that could take out a helicopter or Land Rover. ‘A large machine gun barrel means it could be the IRA. Were they included when they declared their arms? Or were they held back in case they didn’t get a deal they wanted?’. Experts said some of the rifles may have been used by IRA fighters during The Troubles.

"Australian jihadists don't want to come home from Syria - they just want to win or die in a bloody fight for apparent religious glory. That's according to a purported British jihadist in Syria fighting for Jahbut al-Nusra (JN), which is considered a terrorist organisation under Australian law. 'No1 wants to return, here it is victory or shahada (martyrdom) all way,' said apparent militant Abu Basir Jabh Nusra in an online exchange about Australians with former terror suspect Zaky Mallah. The foreign fighter described 'ozzies' who had joined the fight as 'wonderful brothers' and praised their 'cracking accent'. 'No1 wants to return, here it is victory or shahada all way,' said the apparent militant, who used this picture to identify himself . Zaky Mallah, pictured, was the first Australian charged with terrorism offences but was later acquitted and regularly provides comment to the media . He has shared pictures of himself and others in military fatigues and in his online accounts has said he previously lived in the United Kingdom. The exchange came about as Abu Basir was questioned by Mallah about his interactions with Australian fighters. Mallah was the first Australian charged under terrorism offences in 2003 but he was acquitted following two years in maximum security prison. 'I've been in this jihadi world for the past 15 years. I know a real jihadi from a fake jihadi,' said Mallah, who supports JN because it fights Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced a series of counter-terrorism measures, including stripping some Australian foreign fighters of their citizenship, on Monday. Jihadist group: Jahbut al-Nusra members are pictured posing on a tank on the front lines in May 2014 . One of several pictures shared by the purported Jahbut al-Nusra fighter . 'We will ensure returning foreign fighters are prosecuted or closely monitored using strengthened control orders,' Mr Abbott said. The government is concerned that returning fighters would use their military experience overseas in terrorist actions on home soil. Recent government figures say 110 Australian fighters have joined Islamic State. Terrorism expert Professor Greg Barton told Daily Mail Australia the number of Australians who have fought for Jabhut al-Nusra is unclear. Many have changed allegiances from al-Nusra to rival organisation IS, he said, including killed Australian militant Mohammad Ali Baryalei.","Australian jihadists described by purported fighter as 'wonderful brothers'

"Vladimir Putin has said that a war between Russian and neighbouring Ukraine is unlikely and that he hopes it 'never happens'. Speaking to Russian state TV, the President called a military conflict between his country and Ukraine 'an apocalyptic scenario'. This comes as an international security watchdog has warned of several breaches of the ceasefire agreed between Ukranian state troops and separatist rebels. Anti-war: Vladimir Putin, pictured yesterday, called a military conflict between his country and Ukraine 'an apocalyptic scenario', adding that he hopes it 'never happens' 'I think that such an apocalyptic scenario [war] is unlikely and I . hope this will never happen,' he told a reporter with Russia . State TV company. This weekend's prisoner swap between Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels took place after Putin agreed to use his influence on the separatists during a conference call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko. Today, Putin said he did not see the need for another meeting with the leaders of France, Germany and Ukraine on resolution of the conflict. This follows a statement by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, that although the current cease-fire has 'very significantly' lowered the level of military exchanges in Ukraine, violations are still taking place. Lamberto Zannier, head of OSCE, said Monday there have been a number of violations in the south, and some limited incidents around the town of Debaltseve and around the Donetsk airport, both seized by separatists. Vladimir Putin, seen at a wreath-laying ceremony at the tomb of the unknown soldier, during the 'Day of the Fatherland's Defender'-celebrations yesterday, said he 'did not see the need' for more peace meetings . Zannier called the agreed ceasefire 'the best chance ... to de-escalate and bring this conflict to an end,' but he stressed that 'there is work to be done.' Today, Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine said they have begun a large-scale pullback of heavy weapons in line with the peace plan. The claim by Eduard Basurin, a top rebel commander, couldn't immediately be confirmed. Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the observer mission that is monitoring the fighting in eastern Ukraine, said he couldn't comment until receiving monitors' reports at the end of the day. The peace plan that was signed February 15  calls for heavy weapons to be pulled back by each side from the front line by 25 to 70 kilometers (15 to 45 miles), depending on their caliber.

Pro-Russian: Locals greet separatists during a rally to mark the 'Defender of the Fatherland Day' in Donetsk, following several reports of cease-fire violations . The cease-fire has been troubled by violations, leading to concern that it wouldn't solidify and that fighting would continue. A rebel website cited Basurin as saying about 100 122-mm howitzers would be moved on Tuesday. There was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian side, but military officials have said that they won't pull back weapons until a cease-fire fully takes hold. On Tuesday, military spokesman Lt. Col. Anatoliy Stelmakh said rebels had shelled the town of Popasna seven times and launched one barrage on the village of Luhanske. Stelmakh also said rebels tried to storm Ukrainian positions near the southern village of Shyrokyne, which is near the strategic Azov Sea port of Mariupol. Concerns persists that rebels aim to take Mariupol to help establish a land corridor between mainland Russia and the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed last March.","Putin says a war between Russia and Ukraine is 'unlikely'

"A 14-year-old accused of the murder of his mother and sister allegedly told detectives 'I want people to die,' hours after they were both killed when a severe fire swept through their home.

"Evidence from more than 6,600 rape kits that went untested for years in Houston, Texas, have turned up 850 hits in the FBI's nationwide database of DNA profiles. But as the city marked a major step in its $6 million effort to address the backlog, officials admitted that there were some cases where suspects committed other sex crimes while evidence that could have identified them sat untested. So far charges have been filed against 29 people, six of whom have been convicted, since the city launched an effort in 2013 to test 6,663 rape kits. Some of the kits date back as far as 1987. Testing was completed in the fall, and the results have now been uploaded to a database used by investigators nationwide to compare DNA profiles of possible suspects, Mayor Annise Parker said. A rape kit that has been examined and sealed at a crime lab in Los Angeles. Untested kits like this sit in storage all over the country potentially allowing offenders to commit other crimes . 'This milestone is of special importance to rape survivors and their families and friends because it means their cases are receiving the attention they should have years ago,' Parker said at a news conference. Police are continuing to review the matches to see if charges can be filed in other cases. In the cases where prosecutors have won convictions, defendants have received sentences ranging from two to 45 years in prison. One case was dismissed after the victim decided not to pursue the case. In some of the 850 matches the correct person had already been convicted. Houston Mayor Annise Parker said that the backlog 'is not a Houston problem. It's not a Texas problem. It's a nationwide issue that built up over years and years' Rape kits include biological samples and physical evidence gathered from sexual assault victims that are later processed to see if they match a suspect's DNA. Testing results are uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS. A hit means that a suspect's DNA already was in a national law enforcement database in connection with an earlier crime. Of those that went on to commit other crimes, while it is likely that they could have been identified at the time because their DNA was already in CODIS, it is difficult to tell if kits would have contained enough to provide an accurate profile given available technology. 'Now that the testing of these kits is complete, we know that it's up to us to finish the job and to seek justice for these victims. The ball is in our court and we will do our best to put the people who are responsible for these heinous crimes behind bars for as long as possible,' Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said. Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson aims 'to put the people who are responsible for these heinous crimes behind bars for as long as possible' In the case that led to the 45-year prison sentence, Eddy Montiel, 33, plead guilty to aggravated sexual assault, the Houston Chronicle reported. According to court documents, the assault occurred in May 2003. He broke into the victim's East End home in the morning and woke her, asking for money. When the victim, 38 at the time, said she didn't have any and attempted to fight him off, Montiel began smothering her with a pillow. She pleaded with him to stop, asking him 'how can you do this, don't you have a mother,' he then raped her, occasionally brandishing a pocket knife. When he left, he took her cell phone and ripped the house phone off the wall. The victim was afraid to call the police because she worried it might affect her immigration status, but a coworker convinced her to call in the assault, and she agreed to take a sexual assault kit test. It is unclear why her kit went untested, but while it sat, Montiel went on to commit and be convicted of burglary of a habitation with intent to commit sexual assault. He was also later sentenced for two aggravated sexual assault cases and indecency with a child. Experts say Houston's backlog — and similar backlogs in other U.S. cities — are due in part to the high cost of testing which can run from $500 to $1,000 per kit. Advocates argue that the lack of testing signals that sex crimes haven't always been law enforcement priorities. Mayor Parker advocates the work of Houston's specially designed taskforce as a model for other cities to follow. More than 12,000 kits went untested for years in Memphis, Tennessee, which is facing a lawsuit from rape victims as it tries to test the kits. In Detroit, prosecutors discovered more than 11,000 rape kits in an abandoned police warehouse in 2009, and Cleveland prosecutors have sent their entire 4,700-kit backlog for testing. 'This is not a Houston problem. It's not a Texas problem. It's a nationwide issue that built up over years and years,' Parker said.","Over 6,600 rape kits went untested for up to three decades in Houston .

"The differences are subtle enough to easily fool an untrained observer. But a large quantity of fake money, predominantly $50 notes, has flooded Australian cities as outlaw bikie gangs turn to counterfeit money after a major police crackdown on robbery, drugs and firearms. Authorities believe elaborate printing presses are behind a much bigger flow of illegal money, which is being used in conventional consumer purchases but also to pay for drug deals between revival gangs, sparking reprisals. Senior NSW police have told Daily Mail Australia the burgeoning multi-million-dollar operations are a 'serious concern'. Scroll down for video . Can you pick the fake? NSW Police have released a comparison of $50 bills to Daily Mail Australia, with the version at the top being the genuine note and the bottom is a counterfeit version picked up in a recent raid . Queensland Police tracked a Bandidos bikie-gang inspired counterfeit ring south across the NSW border and made this seizure of almost $2million worth of fake money on that state's south coast last year . Police recover evidence during weekend raids on the premises of an outlaw motorcycle gang in WA . State police have been working closely with the Australian Federal Police as they crackdown on the new wave of criminal activity by outlaw motorcycle gangs, including counterfeit and drug rings . Authorities are now uncovering the phoney money on a regular basis across New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, as well as the ACT. In Sydney alone, there are more than 50 suburbs now on the police watch list after illegal currency was reported, mostly in the western suburbs, but the fraudulent flow of bills stretches south to Bargo and Robertson, north to Manly and Umina and through to Bondi in the eastern suburbs. Similarly, in Victoria, the most recent investigations have located the fake cash across Stawell, Ararat and Ringwood. With police in Queensland 'winning the war' on outlaw bikie gangs in the areas of theft, counterfeit money is fast becoming the weapon of choice for criminals, alongside the drug trade. A massive $2 million bust last year by Queensland Police at Warilla on the NSW South Coast did put a slow on the production and flow of counterfeit dollars, according to Detective Superintendent Mick Niland, the head of the state's anti-bikie gang task force. The real deal. Printing presses at Australia's official producer, Note Printing Australia Limited, which is located on a 26 hectare site at Craigieburn in Victoria, 25 kilometres north of Melbourne . Qld Police Det Supt Mick Niland says the collaboration between states and the AFP is proving a success in the chase for the counterfeit crime syndicates. While at left is an example of one of the fake bills picked up by Victoria Police recently when they arrested three people at Stawell 'following a prolonged investigation into the circulation of counterfeit money' Sealed bundles of legitimate $20 bills are produced by the official printing hall in Craigieburn in Victoria . More than 20 properties were raided across Queensland, leading to the arrest of 18 people alleged to have links to the Bandidos bikie gang. 'It certainly slowed them down, we seized a lot of the cash they'd produced and a lot of their assets,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We've had a few seizures since in the thousands of dollars but now they're looking at other areas again.' 'The National Anti-Gang Squad is a very important part of us targeting and dismantling these criminal gangs, it's very much united and committed in the fight. 'And it's right across the country. It is a multi-pronged approach with unprecedented level of co-operation, we are of course working in closely with the AFP to dismantle these crime gangs. 'We will be relentless in our efforts against them regardless where they are operating in Queensland.' It is so serious an issue, the Australian Federal Police Currency Team and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) 'have entered into a working agreement for the administration of counterfeit currency'. 'All currency related matters are co-ordinated and administered from a central location by the AFP with administrative support provided by the RBA,' the AFP said in a statement. As the upsurge in illegal notes took hold in New South Wales late last year, Detective Superintendent Katsogiannis, the Commander of the state's Fraud and Cybercrime Squad urged the community to be on the lookout. 'We have seen an increase in the number of counterfeit banknotes being reported to police,' Det Supt Katsogiannis said. Reports doubled from month-to-month at one stage in late 2014. 'While the notes we’ve seized have been from a range of denominations, the vast majority are fifty and one hundred dollar notes.' Queensland Police believe they broke up a counterfeit syndicate when they arrested members of an outlaw motorcycle gang and recovered almost $2million worth of fake bills . The RBA states that 'printed sheets are then guillotined into individual banknotes and transported through computer-controlled machines for final counting, removal of imperfect banknotes, and banding' Evidence: NSW Police say this is among the fake money they uncovered during an operation in Lithgow . After the cutting process, 'the final stage of the process sees the finished banknotes shrink-wrapped, moved onto pallets and stored in a strong-room prior to distribution around the country' The counterfeit bills have most recently surfaced in Lithgow, on the western slopes of the Blue Mountains, at a number of local businesses. A 21-year-old man was arrested and later released and was assisting police investigations. A joint police operation led to the arrest last October of one man, aged 23, after a range of businesses across NSW, Victoria and the ACT alerted authorities to the use of counterfeit $50 bills. The Reserve Bank says that: Historically, Australia has one of the lowest rates of counterfeiting in the world. Most people will never see a counterfeit. Even so, it is vitally important that people are aware of the security features included on Australia's banknotes.' 'All Australian banknotes have similar security features, though their location can vary. To determine if a suspect banknote is a counterfeit, it is best to compare it with a banknote that is known to be genuine.' 1 Feel the banknote, Australian banknotes are printed on plastic, they are difficult to tear and will spring back after being scrunched. 2 Check the clear window. Make sure the window hasn’t been added on and the printed image can’t be easily rubbed off. Also look for embossing on $10, $20, $50 and $100 banknotes. 3 Look for the star diamond-shaped patterns are printed inside a circle on both sides of the banknote. When held up to the light, they form a seven-pointed star. 4 Check the shadow image. The Australian Coat of Arms should appear on the bank note when it is held up to the light. 5 Look for the microprinting. Under a magnifying glass, tiny words can be seen in the top left corner of the $5 banknote and near the portraits on other banknotes. Source: RBA . 'Some of the counterfeit notes we’ve seized have been printed on paper, and some on plastic. All genuine banks notes are printed on a special form of plastic,' Det Supt Katsogiannis said. 'As for the counterfeit notes printed on plastic, they feel slightly thicker than genuine bank notes. 'Furthermore, the clarity of the images on the counterfeit plastic notes is not as sharp as it is on genuine ones.' The New South Wales locations where the counterfeit notes have been uncovered since July last year include: Ashfield, Balmain, Bankstown, Bargo, Blacktown, Bondi Junction, Bowral, Broadmeadow, Camperdown, Canley Vale, Caringbah, Chatswood, Colyton, Doonside, Epping, Glebe, Gundagai, Hurstville, Ingleburn, Kogarah, Liverpool, Manly, Marrickville, Marsfield, Milperra, Mittagong, Moss Vale, Mount Pritchard, North St Marys, Parramatta, Penrith, Punchbowl, Pyrmont, Robertson, Rooty Hill, St Marys, Strathfield, Surry Hills, Sydney CBD, The Rocks, Umina Beach, Werrington and West Ryde. The Reserve Bank states that there is just one official printing press for Australia's currency, 'Australia's banknotes are printed by Note Printing Australia Limited which is located on a 26 hectare site at Craigieburn, Victoria, 25 kilometres north of Melbourne'. Security there is of the highest order. '(The) main production building is a purpose-built four-storey, reinforced concrete structure .. the site is bounded by high-security perimeter fencing, has an armed guard force protecting it around the clock and is supported by a range of highly sophisticated electronic security and surveillance devices.' The RBA says it's a simple exercise to check whether you're handling real money or fake. 1 Is it plastic? 2 Look for the coat of arms 3 Diamond-shaped patterns are printed inside a circle on both sides of the bank note, if you hold the note up to the light, the patterns should line up perfectly to form a seven-pointed star 4 And finally check the clear window which should be an integral part of the banknote and not an addition. Check that the white image printed on the window cannot be easily rubbed off . Victorian Police say this note from an arrest at Ararat is clearly identifiable as a fake . Australian banknotes are printed on sheets of polymer substrate in the NPA printing hall 'using various printing plates, processes, machines and inks'. 'Different sized sheets are used for each denomination,' the RBA reveals. 'The first printing process involves the background colours and patterns being printed onto both sides of the polymer sheets at the same time. these machines can print up to 8,000 sheets per hour. 'Separate print runs are required for each side of the sheet. The resulting raised print is one of the important security features of Australia's polymer banknotes. 'Serial numbers are then added to the sheets using a letterpress printing process. 'In a final print run, the banknote sheets are given two coats of a protective over-coating ink using an offset printing press. This overcoat contributes to the extended durability of polymer banknotes as it protects the printing. It also helps to keep the banknotes clean. 'Printed sheets are then guillotined into individual banknotes and transported through computer-controlled machines for final counting, removal of imperfect banknotes, and banding. 'The final stage of the process sees the finished banknotes shrink-wrapped, moved onto pallets and stored in a strong-room prior to distribution around the country.' The Australian Crime Commission estimates that 'serious and organised crime costs Australia $15 billion every year'.

They located a number of $100 and $50 notes on this occasion .","A record number of fake bills have been picked up across three states in the past six months .

"Old Man Winter has dropped so much snow in North America in the last few months people are running out of places to put it all - so they're tunneling through it instead. Pictures of snow tunnels have been popping up on social media for the past few weeks and they will probably keep coming as long as the Siberian Express and other storms continue to roll in. Here are a few stories of the next generation of Mole People - the Snow People... Scroll down for video . There has been so much snow in parts of North America that people have resorted to tunneling through it . A team of diggers spent ten hours digging a tunnel (pictured) to make the Wellington T station in Medford, Massachusetts, accessible to bikers and commuters . When the tunnel through the snow was completed, it was about 40-feet long and big enough to bike through . Even though some of the tunnels aren't that long, they still took a lot of work to create and maintain . A Canadian couple got nearly two stories of snow in their backyard, so they only way to get to their cars was to dig. Marcel Landry of Prince Edward Island was out digging for nearly seven hours before completing a snow tunnel that reached his car. The tunnel Landry created was 25-feet long and six-feet high in some places, the Journal Pioneer reported. He originally started with a smaller tunnel, but realized it could collapse on him. In order to determine which direction to dig, he used the emergency button on his keys to make his car horn go off. Humans aren't the only creatures who are embracing snow tunnels during the cold this winter . Pictures of snow tunnels have been popping up on social media sites like Instagram for the past few weeks . Some diggers are choosing to go with a more open-air version of the snow tunnel this winter . Many of the snow tunnels that have been dug this winter will stand until the weather starts to warm up . His fiancee Stephanie Collicutt took photos and assisted with the work. Landry said: 'I've never seen anything like this. 'Once it started looking like a tunnel I just started having too much fun with it. 'I laughed all night.' After the pictures of the tunnel began circulating on social media, a crew showed up to assist with the snow excavation, The Guardian reported. The tunnel was basically ruined during several hours of digging, but the cars are free. Landry said: 'It's a relief. 'It's hard to believe between five of us we (only) got that much done in a whole afternoon. 'I can't imagine how long it would have taken me by myself. We're pretty grateful.' Landry and Collicutt aren't the only people to dig a snow tunnel. It wasn't exactly the 'Big Dig' the town is known for, but some Bostonians used the tunnel technique to unearth a popular path that was buried by a substantial snow pile. A team of diggers led by Ari Goldberger and his friend Shadron Davis spent about ten hours digging a tunnel on the Wellington Greenway to make the Wellington T station in Medford, Massachusetts, accessible to bikers and commuters. When they were finished, the tunnel was 40-feet long. Some New England residents are using their shovels to dig tunnels instead of dig out their cars and homes . Dogs don't have to use tunnels to commute, but that doesn't mean they don't enjoy going through them . This snow tunnel probably didn't take ten hours to dig, but it is still an example of the latest winter trend . The snow tunnel stood for two days before it mysteriously collapsed, according to Mashable. Goldberger said: 'I'm guessing it was kind of a cover-your-ass type move from the MBTA [Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]. 'It was definitely a fun thing ... haven't you always wanted to make a giant giant snow tunnel? 'Given the opportunity, I might do it again, but I really hope that the opportunity doesn't present itself.' Another Massachusetts man isn't digging tunnels through the 'historic Boston snow' - he's selling it. Kyle Waring started ShipSnowYo.com so people in cold areas could send snow to friends and family members in warmer climates to let them experience the white stuff, Boston.com reported. He started off selling snow-filled water bottles for $19.99 (shipping included) and has moved on to selling six pounds of snow for $89. People have been buying the chilly commodity. Waring said: 'It seems to be corporations paying for the $90 product as a funny gesture, where the $20 one is regular consumers. 'At this rate, it's going to be July until the snow melts. 'I've thought about taking this idea and running with it for other seasonal items. Maybe I'll ship some fall foliage.' A man created ShipSnowYo.com for people to send snow to friends and family members in warmer climates .

"With a front measuring just 47 inches wide, 'the Wedge' has certainly earned its name and place in the record books. The unique house in Millport in the Isle of Cumbrae in Scotland has been dubbed the narrowest in the world for its slim frontage. It has made the Guinness Book of Records and has just gone on the market for £85,000. And despite its narrow frontage and shape, current owner Peter McBride insists there is enough room - especially as the house gets wider as you go through to the back. The Wedge (front door pictured centre) has the narrowest frontage of any house in the world and has just gone on the market for £85,000. It is named in the Guinness Book of Records because of its slim frontage . Mr McBride bought the house in 2001 with his late wife Judy  after the couple were attracted to the property's distinctive shape, likened to a wedge of cheese. 'I heard all about the house when it last went up for sale back in 2000 and was being talked about on the radio,' the retired businessman told MailOnline. 'After we heard about it my wife and I came to have a look and we bought it straight away.' The property has been named the Wedge because it gets wider as you go through the house towards the back and is shaped like a wedge of cheese. It has one bedroom and bathroom as well as a lounge, kitchen area and inner hall. Mr McBride said he has decided to sell the property following the death of his wife five years ago. June (left) and George Allison (right) sold the house in 2001, and got it into the Guinness Book of Records . The Allisons show how the interior of the house has earned its nickname 'The Wedge' for its tapering shape . The Wedge, pictured in 2000 with former owners the Allisons, gets wider towards the back of the house . He added: 'I think it is just time for me to move away now. 'The sea is just 30 yards away, so you get beautiful sea views.' Mr McBride said he has not been forced to buy special furniture for the Wedge, but has equipped the house with narrower chairs. At its widest point towards the rear the house measures 22ft long by 11ft wide. In an advert for the property the description reads: 'Uninterrupted sea views, would be of interest to a wide spectrum of purchasers early viewing highly recommended.' Mr McBride bought the property from George and June Allison in 2001. The house was put on the market for £27,000 but Mr McBride declined to say how much he paid for it. Current photos of the Wedge show there is enough space for a double bed and storage in the bedroom . Mr McBride said the house gets larger as you go to the back because of its wedge shape, giving enough room . The retired businessman praised the sea views from the property while estate agents have advised viewings . When the Allisons bought the property in the 1980s they had no idea that it could make the record books. It was only drawn to their attention when a friend noticed that another house in the south of England had claimed to be the narrowest in the world. The couple got The Wedge measured and it earned its place in the Guinness Book of Records for the world's narrowest frontage of a house. The house may hold the place at the moment, but is closely followed by other properties across the globe contending for the 'narrowest' title. Squeezed into a tower block in Warsaw, Poland, houses measure just under 60 inches wide and go back almost 40ft into the block. And in Brighton Iain and Rachel Boyle rent out a house which measures six foot wide and is in the Hollingdean area of the city. They bought the property for £8,000 more than 15 years ago.","The Wedge in Millport in Isle of Cumbrae has narrowest frontage in world .

"Indonesia's vice president says they will reimburse Australia's $1 billion  in tsunami relief aid if it's 'deemed not humanitarian' after Tony Abbott's tough talk on clemency for the Bali Nine was taken as a threat. Vice President Jusuf Kalla said Australia was one of 56 countries to send aid to Indonesia when the Boxing Day tsunami hit in 2004, but the government was ready to pay back the money if that's what the country wanted, the Jakarta Post reports.

The truck driver, who has not been named, was being treated at a local medical center for minor injuries. He is being questioned by police. Officials initially said that the driver had stopped his produce truck on the tracks and the accident was 'avoidable'. However at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Oxnard police Officer Miguel Lopez said the man may have accidentally turned on to the tracks and become stuck became he did not know the area. When police first responded to the scene they found the tractor-trailer 'engulfed in flames'. Once fire crews extinguished the blaze, police found the cabin of the truck empty.

"Medical marijuana may soon be available to Orthodox Jews in New York as rabbis work with companies  seeking to sell kosher edibles to Jewish patients in the state. New York's Orthodox Union is in discussion with companies aiming to provide kosher, edible marijuana products to Jews in the state -- but only those with medical needs, the Jewish Daily Forward reports. The medical marijuana is expected to go on sale  next year. Marijuana: Medical marijuana may soon be available to Orthodox Jews in New York as rabbis work with companies seeking to sell kosher edibles to Jewish patients in the state (stock image) Rabbi Moshe Elefant, COO of the OU’s kosher certification agency, told the Forward that the agency would have no problem certifying medical marijuana because of its clear medical benefits. Elefant said the OU was approached several weeks ago by a company with marijuana factories in Colorado, where both the medicinal and recreational use of the drug are legal, according to the New York Post. Kosher certification is not necessary for the plant itself, according to the Forward, but medical marijuana patients will not be allowed to smoke it due to Health Department regulations in the state where companies are vying for licenses to grow and sell the drug. Instead, patients will have to ingest it in other ways, such as food, drinks, or capsules, which require kosher certification for Orthodox patients. While many Orthodox rabbis seem to accept medical marijuana, the same can not be said for their stance on recreational use of the drug.

Edibles: Patients will have to ingest marijuana in ways such as food, drinks, or capsules, which require kosher certification for Orthodox patients (stock image of marijuana gummy edibles) Rabbi J. David Bleich, an authority on medical ethics at Yeshiva University in New York, told the Forward that while medical marijuana is 'a perfectly acceptable use of a plant that grows in God’s garden,' recreational use of the drug would be solely for pleasure purposes, and is 'certainly not that to which a Jew should aspire.' But, he added: 'I can't tell you the 614th mitzvah is thou shalt not smoke pot.' This effort marks one of the latest endeavors among Progressive Jews -- as opposed to traditional Orthodox Judaism. Progression: Many progressive Jews view the legalization of marijuana as a social justice issue arguing that drug policy in the U.S. criminalizes otherwise law-abiding citizens . Ean Seeb, owner of a Denver, Colo. marijuana dispensary, is one of several Jews who pushed for the legalization of marijuana in the state where the drug was legalized in 2012. 'We have shown here in Colorado that you can effectuate social change without the world crashing down on you,' Seeb said. He compared the Jewish involvement in marijuana activity to that of its involvement in the civil rights movements of the 1960s and prohibition in the alcohol industry, according to Forward. Many Progressive Jews view the legalization of marijuana as a social justice issue arguing that drug policy in the U.S. criminalizes otherwise law-abiding citizens. Marijuana is legal in nearly half of the U.S. and a handful of states allow recreational use of the drug as well.","Kosher, edible marijuana products are expected to be sold to Jews in New York in the next year .

"Inappropriate: Ellen Pao claims she received pornographic materials from her male colleagues while working for Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers.  Pictured above outside court on Tuesday . The trial of a high-profile sex bias lawsuit in Silicon Valley began Tuesday with a lawyer for a former junior partner at a venture capital firm claiming his client was denied a promotion because of her gender and then fired when she complained. In his opening statement, lawyer Alan Exelrod said plaintiff Ellen Pao was discriminated against in the male-dominated culture of Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers — the defendant in the case that has sparked debate over the treatment of women in the high-tech and venture capitalist arenas. Exelrod said Pao, 45, had received erotic poetry and sketches of nude women from a senior partner at the firm, and another male employee interfered with her work when Pao broke off an affair with him. The firm has denied wrongdoing and said Pao was a poor performer who didn't get along with her colleagues. An attorney for the firm was expected to give an opening statement later in the day. Pao is seeking $16million in damages. The trial in San Francisco Superior Court could last four weeks. The jury includes five men and seven women. Venture capital firms provide much of the startup funds for tech companies and have a reputation as being even more insular and male-dominated than the companies they help launch. 'This case is a wakeup call,' said longtime Stanford University law professor Deborah Rhode, who teaches gender equity law. 'The case has sparked a much-needed debate about gender inequality regardless of its merit.' Women hold 15 to 20 percent of the technology jobs at tech giants Google, Apple, Facebook and Yahoo, according to disclosures by the companies. The firms acknowledge needing to do more to hire female engineers but largely attribute the problem to cultural issues that discourage girls and young women from taking classes needed to pursue careers in computer coding and website design. High-stakes: Pao is currently suing her old firm for $16million, claiming she was discriminated based on her gender. Pictured on the right during her days working at Kleiner Perkins with senior partner John Doerr, who she served as chief of staff to . Venture capital firms are even more slanted toward men. A 2011 survey by the National Venture Capital Association found women accounted for 11 percent of investors. A study released last year by Babson College in Massachusetts found that women filled just 6 percent of the partner-level positions at 139 venture capital firms in 2013, down from 10 percent in 1999. Kleiner fired Pao in 2012 — six months after she filed her lawsuit.  She had been hired in 2005 to serve as chief of staff for senior partner John Doerr, who helped direct early investments in Google and Amazon and who currently serves on President Barack Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Pao left the administrative position with Doerr in 2010 to become a junior partner with full-time investment duties. Pao claims she was excluded from important meetings, email chains and company dinners because women 'kill the buzz' of such festive occasions, according to the lawsuit. Long fight: Pao's trial against Kleiner Perkins could last as long as four weeks. Pictured above with her attorney Therese Lawless (left) during a lunch break on Tuesday . Bad blood: Pao has also revealed that she had an affair with a married colleague who took vengeance on her career when she later broke up with him.

"The capital has seen several days of crazy clothing both on and off the catwalks as some of the world's best designers showcase their wares during London Fashion Week. But fittingly, one of the most bizarre shows of the week came right at the end of the style event - with a show by Marko Mitanovski. The Serbian designer hosted one of the most jaw-dropping collections at the Freemasons' Hall earlier today. Scroll down for video . Marko Mitanovski showcased a bizarre collection at London Fashion Week earlier today, sending the models down the catwalk painted from head-to-toe in black paint . Models painted from head to toe in black paint were sent down the catwalk in leather and latex designs that were inspired by nature and architecture. The ghoulish-looking models had most of their features completely hidden by the shiny oils, which were then accessorised with black facial jewels. In contrast, the final model sent down the catwalk was painted in a bright white. Marko told Modaterra.com that his inspiration for the theme of the show came from the outside world, saying: 'I was inspired by nature, birds, skeletons and architecture. 'I worked with sculptures for this collection and jewelry design. It was how I created the pieces with latex and leather.' Marko Mitanovski covered models in black paint and black facial jewels . At the end of the show, he set down a single model covered from head to toe in white paint . The designs were inspired by birds and architecture . While his collection was based on many different influences, Marko's choice to paint the models in black came simply down to his tastes in colour. He said: 'I chose to do the whole collection in black because it's my favourite colour. [This collection] is about celebrating life in a weird way,  I do not believe it's dark - It's about something mystical, not about something that is negative.' Marko also revealed that the reason behind finishing the show with a model painted in white was simply because it contrasted with the other models. He said: 'The last collection closed the show with someone using only white, so I decided to do the same this season.' Marko hoped to create a mystical allure using the black body paint . Only a few of the models were free to walk down the catwalk without any body paint . The Serbian designer is known for creating sculptural and theatrical creations . The London-based fashion maven, whose designs have been worn by the likes of   Paloma Faith, Skunk Anansie, Katie Melua and Immodesty Blaize, is known for his sculptural and theatrical creations. His biggest celebrity fan though, is Lady Gaga, who even wore the designer's creations on her Monster Ball world tour. Gaga's ex-stylist Nicola Formichetti saw his collection at London Fashion Week in 2009 and got in contact to ask if he would help with costumes for a photoshoot they were doing for W magazine, the partnership then grew from there. Marko told lanciatrendvisions.com: 'Nicola Formichetti saw my collection and asked me to make costumes for Lady Gaga’s shoot for Q Magazine. 'Then we did some more costumes for interludes of her Monster Ball Tour, as well as for her Android Telephones campaign and many other projects. 'Lady Gaga’s influence in fashion definitely helped me in getting bigger international exposure, but it's also thanks to her team.' The single white model was designed to create a contrast among the women painted in black . A huge team of stylists and make-up artists were on hand to create the bizarre catwalk looks . Adding the jewels and make-up took hours for each model . Many of the models had their features obscured by the dark paint .","Marko Mitanovski showcased a bizarre collection at London Fashion Week earlier today .

"A bank manager said he and his mother were strapped to supposed explosives after two masked suspects broke into their home on Monday morning. The man said he was then forced to drive the suspects to the Achieve Financial Credit Union in New Britain, Connecticut, which, sources say, the suspects planned to rob. It wasn't until officers responded to the home invasion call in Bristol and found a woman tied to her bed, with an explosive placed underneath, that they realized the two incidents were connected. Police said they have not yet determined if the bank manager is a victim or a suspect. The manager of Achieve Financial Credit Union (pictured) and his mother were strapped to supposed explosive devices after two masked suspects broke into their Bristol, Connecticut home Monday morning . Police found the man sitting outside the bank alone in a car with a device still strapped to his body. Officers cleared the area and brought in the FBI, bomb squad and SWAT team . The mother was found at the home (pictured) tied to her bed, with a device underneath. Although police have not identified the man, public records show the house belongs to credit union CFO Matthew Yussman . Sources say the suspects told Yussman he would have to 'empty the vault', but that he was able to call a co-worker who notified police . When police arrived at the scene they found the man sitting alone in a car outside the Credit Union, the explosives still tied to his body. The man said the intruders threatened to kill both him and his mother if he did not take cash out of the credit union, according to the Hartford Courant. The suspects had disappeared by the time police arrived. Although he has not yet been identified by police, public records show the home in Bristol belongs to credit union CFO Matthew Yussman, according to WFSB. Neighbors told say he lives at the house with his mother. The man was kept in the vehicle while officers 'cleared the area of residents and shut down nearby roadways,' New Britain Police Chief James Wardwell said during a press conference. Public works trucks were brought in as 'shields' because, according to Wardwell, they would be large enough to withstand a blast or 'keep a vehicle from fleeing'. After the device was removed from the man's body and turned over to the FBI, he was handcuffed and taken to the hospital for evaluation. Both devices were determined 'not to be real', according to NBC Connecticut. Police said they are searching for multiple suspects and neither the man nor his mother were injured. The bank manager is being interviewed and is still under investigation, according to Wardwell. 'We're considering all possibilities, whether or not he was coerced, doing something against his will, or a suspect,' he said.

"Draped in the blue velvet robes of the Order of the Garter and with a plumed hat in his hands, at first glance the Duke of Winsdsor looks every inch a king. But in this extraordinary photograph – which has never been seen before - the silver-haired former Edward VIII is not posing in state in one of the royal palaces of Britain. Instead, he stands squinting in the sun in the back garden of his French country house, replacing the ceremonial garter around his calf with a blue ribbon. Scroll down for video . The Duke of Windsor poses in his Order of the Garter robes in a photograph that has never been seen before . This picture is part of a stash of three photo albums capturing  decades of the duke's life with wife Wallis Simpson, the Duchess of Windsor, which has remained hidden until now. It appears in the new issue of Hello! magazine, along with earlier photographs from the albums, that are being published for the first time. Filled with intimate shots up to the former king's death in 1972, the three albums  give a hitherto-unseen glimpse into Edward's life as Prince of Wales, King Edward VIII and then duke. After the duke's death in 1972 they passed into the possession of his gardener, Henri Gay, 90, who said he had a close working relationship with his royal employer. Mr Gay told the magazine: 'We shared a passion for gardening and nature that cut across the difference in our social backgrounds.' As the Prince of Wales, Edward poses with future wife Wallis Simpson and dogs at Fort Belvedere, Windsor . The Duke and Duchess of Windsor's former country home La Moulin de la Tuilerie in Gif sur Yvette, south west of Paris, from 1952 to 1972 . An official photographer shoots Prince Edward (left) posing in his Garter robes in Buckingham Palace after his investiture in 1911 at the age of 17; the Illustrated London News pictured King Edward VIII in garter robes (right). The caption notes he was depicted as the Prince of Wales, and the picture is a water colour replica of an artist's oil painting which hung in the Guildhall Portsmouth measuring 9ft by 6ft . Mr Gay, who is retired and lives near Montpelier, was head gardener at Le Moulin de la Tuilerie, the Windsor's country retreat southwest of Paris, for seven years from 1966. He told Hello! that after the duke's death in 1972, the duchess gave him the photo albums  on her last visit to the house before it was sold - and she generously left him $10,000 in her will. For him, the volumes initially held sentimental value but as the years passed he began to realise their historical significance. The intimate snaps of the Duke of Windsor are in this issue of Hello! Magazine . The gardener, who worked for the couple with his wife Renee, said he was the photographer behind the picture of the older, silver-haired duke posing in the historic garb in front of, what looks like, a farm building. Mr Gay said: 'On one occasion he called me over to take a picture of him in his robes. 'It was in the garden where he had installed a mini-golf course. He loved mini-golf.' Interestingly, two parts of the official ceremonial robes are missing: he is not wearing the gold link-chain 'collar' and he has tied a blue ribbon around his leg rather than the official garter. According to Hello!, the first album of the collection passed to Mr Gay, is labeled The Fort after the Duke's home in Windsor, Fort Belvedere and seems to track his growing passion for the thin, abrasive American woman, as she features in almost every shot. Other snaps capture Edward's brief time as king as well as a Mediterranean cruise he took with Wallis. The photos are just another glimpse into the life one of the most controversial royals who courted scandal with his fast-living set in the 1930s and refused to assume a life of duty when he became king. In fact, on becoming king  20 January 193l, he caused a constitutional crisis just months into his reign by seeking to marry Wallis Simpson, an American socialite who had divorced one man and was trying to divorce another. Preferring to marry Wallis, Edward abdicated after 326 days, becoming the shortest-reigning monarch in British history. In an address to the nation, he said: 'I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.' After his abdication, his younger brother Albert took the throne - and the name George VI - while his wife Elizabeth became queen, and their eldest daughter Elizabeth, first in line for the throne. The newly-titled Duke of Windsor married Wallis in a private ceremony on 3 June, 1937, at Château de Candé near Tours, France. The new king forbade any members of the royal family to attend the wedding and denied the Duchess of Windsor the styling of 'Her Royal Highness', which added to the strained relationship between the Windsors and the rest of the royals. Edward hoped to settle in Britain after a couple of years of exile in France but his brother George VI threatened to cut off his allowance if he returned to Britain without an invitation. During the war, he was installed as the Governor of the Bahamas but afterwards he and the duchess returned to France where they spent the rest of their lives, becoming international socialites in Paris and New York. While relaxing at Le Moulin, the only property the couple would own, Edward and Wallis hosted the biggest stars of the day including Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Aristotle Onassis, Maria Callas, Marlene Dietrich and Cecil Beaton. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor and the era in which they lived continues to fascinate, with Madonna's film W.E focusing on the couple's love affair and the Oscar-winning King's Speech highlighting the relationship between his brother the Duke of York and then George VI and his speech therapist. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who had been married for 12 years, pictured here in 1949 at Victoria Station . The Order of the Garter is the oldest British Order of Chivalry and was founded by Edward III in 1348. It is said to have been founded when at a court ball, a lady lost one of her garters and King Edward bent down, picked it up and - amid blushes and laughter - tied it around his own leg with the remark: 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' which means, 'Shame on him who thinks this evil'. The phrase is  now the Order's motto. The Order consists of the monarch and 24 knights and honours men and women (permitted to join the order in 1987) who have served the nation or the sovereign. Members of the royal family are also permitted to join in addition to the 24 knights and include Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Duke of York, Earl of Wessex and Duke of Cambridge. St George is the order's patron saint and St George's Chapel, Windsor is its spiritual home. The ceremonial robes have changed and evolved over the years but today the insignia includes the following items: .

"A piece of graffiti featuring the names of three young sisters who may have fallen victim to the 1515 plague has been discovered on the wall of a medieval church. The names of Cateryn, Jane and Amee Maddyngley were found scrawled near the front door of All Saint's and St Andrew's Church in Kingston, near Cambridge, by amateur archaeologists. The writing, which features their names and date, shows they left their mark on the village church in 1515 – as the country was hit by an outbreak of the bubonic plague. The medieval graffiti, showing the names of Cateryn, Jane and Amee Maddyngley (pictured), was discovered on a wall of All Saint's and St Andrew's Church in Kingston, near Cambridge, by by amateur archaeologists . The markings of Cateryn, Jane and Amee Maddyngley (pictured with the markings coloured in) stretch back to 1515 and have been discovered for the first time by Norfolk and Suffolk Medieval Graffiti Survey volunteers . It was found hidden under lime wash which was removed by Norfolk and Suffolk Medieval Graffiti Survey volunteers. Archaeologist Matt Champion said the three girls were almost certainly children because their names have not been listed as adults in any parish records. Other records reveal that members of their family were tenant farmers who had lived in Kingston since at least 1279. Centuries ago it was common for individuals to scrawl their names in churches as they were unable to afford memorials. Mr Champion, who is working with a team which studies medieval graffiti, said their project had shown that church plague graffiti was far more common than previously thought. He said the elite and wealthy were remembered with monuments while graffiti remembered the 'common voice'. He said: 'The most heart-breaking inscriptions are those that refer to long-dead children. 'This one is particularly emotive because it's the names of three girls who all died in the same year. 'These people often couldn't afford to have themselves memorialised and in some cases this graffiti could have been the last mark of their life and that is heart-breaking.' Although no records show how the girls died, it is believed they fell victim to the Black Death. One of the inscriptions discovered by Norfolk and Suffolk Medieval Graffiti Survey volunteers at the Cambridge church was a prayer, asking for God to have mercy upon the soul of an individual called 'Watton' Another inscription was that of a ritual protection marks – also known as witch marks - which wards off evil . During their time spent uncovering the works in the church, the team also found a number of other inscriptions including ritual protection marks – also known as witch marks - which are said to ward of evil spirits. Other inscriptions show figures of armed men and prayers to those who had fallen ill from the plague. The plea 'God save us' was also found scrawled across the church in Steeple Bumstead, Cambridgeshire, and is believed to be dated back to 1348. The Reverend Dr Alexandra Clarke, of All Saint's and St Andrew's Church, said the discovery of the graffiti was pleasing. She said: 'None of us knew about the graffiti so it has added something to our local knowledge and it's very exciting. 'The church is full of absolutely fascinating historical details. It has stunning 14th Century wall painting and there is a lot of graffiti chiselled in the tower - which was used by a school for years.' Churchwarden Peter Reynolds added that the new discovery was 'a bit mysterious' for the church, which is open every day to visitors. He said: 'This is a new discovery. The group that came are experts who used cameras and equipment to find the graffiti. A lot of it isn't visible to the naked eye.' The project to unearth medieval graffiti was set up in 2010 and is the first attempt to survey pre-Reformation graffiti in churches since the late 1960s. Pictured: An example of graffiti from Ashwell church, Hertfordshire . Peter Reynolds, Churchwarden of All Saints and St Andrew's Church, and the Reverend Dr Alexandra Clarke (together above) said the discovery was 'exciting' and 'adds something to the village's local knowledge' The 1515 outbreak of the bubonic plague started in London and quickly spread across south east England. At the time, Cambridge University suspended its classes and large gatherings of people were banned from attending public events. Children were particularly hard-hit and their bodies were usually hastily buried in unmarked graves. The graffiti project was set up in 2010 and is the first attempt to survey pre-Reformation graffiti in churches since the late 1960s. Volunteers use digital cameras and powerful lamps to reveal previously hidden or faded markings. At least 60 per cent of the 650 churches surveyed in Norfolk, Suffolk and north Essex have been found to contain 'significant amounts' of graffiti and volunteers have recorded up to 500 pieces in many of them. The project has confirmed that most of the medieval graffiti was created during times of pestilence such as the Black Death of 1349 and subsequent outbreaks of plagues. The bubonic plague is one of the most devastating diseases in history, having killed millions of people during the 'Black Death' in the 14th Century. It resulted in the deaths of an estimated 75 to 200 million people  in Europe between 1346 and 1353 and claimed thousands of other victims during the dozens of additional outbreaks  later down the line. Drawings and paintings from the Black Death, which wiped out about a third of the European population, depict town criers shouting 'bring out your dead' while dragging trailers piled with infected corpses through the streets. The plague is caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia pestis, which uses the flea as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats. It causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance of large swellings on the groin, armpits or neck, known as 'buboes'. The bubonic plague kills up to two thirds of sufferers within just four days if it is not treated. However, if antibiotics are administered within 24 hours of infection, patients are highly likely to survive. After the Black Death arrived in 1347, the plague became a common phenomenon in Europe, with outbreaks recurring regularly until the 18th Century. Bubonic plague has now almost completely vanished from the western world, with 90 per cent of all cases now found in Africa. However, there have been a few non-fatal cases in the U.S. in recent years, while in August 2013 a 15-year-old boy died in Kyrgyzstan after eating a groundhog infected with the disease. Three months later, an outbreak in a Madagascan killed at least 20 people in a week. A year before 60 people died as a result of the infection, more than in any other country in the world. Outbreaks in China have been rare in recent years, and most have happened in remote rural areas of the west. China's state broadcaster said there were 12 diagnosed cases and three deaths in the province of Qinghai in 2009, and one in Sichuan in 2012. In the U.S. between five and 15 people die every year as a result, mostly in western states.","Medieval graffiti unearthed on church wall reveals names of three sisters .

"Wonga announced today it would make a third of its total workforce redundant after it was forced to cap its interest rates on payday loans. The lender will shed 325 jobs after the Financial Conduct Authority said the interest they could charge for loans would be a maximum 100 per cent of its total cost from January 2. Previously businesses like Wonga, Quickquid and the Moneyshop would lend small amounts of around £50 to £3,000 for short periods of time at rates which could run up to 6,000 per cent a year. A typical Wonga loan used to be £150 lent over 18 days and a customer would then pay back £183.49 including interest and charges at an APR of 5,853 per cent. The FCA said a cap was needed to better regulate the industry, but experts have said that the new cap could sink the industry completely. Job cuts: Wonga announced today it would make a third of its total workforce redundant after it was forced to cap its interest rates on payday loans . In a series of New Year clampdowns the FCA decided that payday lenders are also no longer allowed to roll over a loan more than twice and they can make only two unsuccessful attempts to claw money back out of a borrower's account. And default fees have been capped at £15 pounds rather than the average £40 paid now. It came as another watchdog decided that all payday lenders will be ordered to put their deals on comparison websites in a move that could save  Britain's 1.8million customers at least £60 a year. Problems: Chairman Andy Haste said Wonga will become  less profitable after new regulations so must shed 325 jobs . The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has said that a lack of price competition between lenders has led to higher costs for borrowers in yet another clampdown on the industry. Wonga said today the job cuts were necessary and hundreds will be told if they are redundant after a 30 day consultation period. The move will save around £25million over the next two years. Chairman Andy Haste said Wonga will become smaller and less profitable in the near term as it introduces changes to make sure it lends 'fairly and responsibly'. He said: 'Wonga can no longer sustain its high cost base which must be significantly reduced to reflect our evolving business and market. Regrettably, this means we've had to take tough but necessary decisions about the size of our workforce'. It is expected a phased reduction in jobs will mainly affect teams that support the UK business from London, Dublin, Cape Town and Tel Aviv, eventually leaving Wonga with a UK-related workforce of around 325 people. The remaining roles are expected to be based in London and Cape Town, with plans to close the Tel Aviv office by mid-2015 and the Dublin office by mid-2016. New rules: Payday lenders such as Wonga have been subject to a raft of new regulations over the last year . Last month there was uproar when Wonga escaped prosecution for sending out fake legal letters designed to put pressure on customers who were behind on their loans. The City of London police announced that Britain's biggest payday lender would not face criminal charges over the scandal, despite admitting it was in the wrong. Last June, the City watchdog announced that Wonga had agreed to pay £2.6 million in compensation for the letters which it sent to 45,000 struggling borrowers from non-existent law firms. At the time, the firm was blasted by consumer groups and MPs, who demanded to know why the company and its executives were not being fined or prosecuted over the harassment. Subsequently, the City of London police agreed to look into the case, however the force said there was insufficient evidence to take action. Wonga also promised to compensate all the thousands of victims, but large numbers are still to be paid. Meanwhile the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) demanded at least one payday lender comparison following a 20-month investigation into the payday lending market, . They say it is essential so consumers can better understand interest rates, late fees and other charges. The watchdog, which has been talking to price comparison websites about the issue, said it believes that at least one website, and possibly more, will emerge which people can use to compare the cost of a payday loan. If this does not happen, lenders will be obliged to set up a price comparison website which is authorised by regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Picture of Britain: Research published after a 20-month investigation found that around a third of payday loans were paid back late or not at all . The CMA's report, released today, said that while comparison websites uSwitch and MoneySuperMarket ruled themselves out of opening a new sites, others may be willing. Gocompare said it would consider launching a payday loans comparison service on its website, as would Comparethemarket.com and Confused.com. The CMA has estimated that the UK's 1.8 million payday loan customers could typically be up to £60 a year better off if it was easier for them to shop around. The FCA also told the CMA that it had had approaches from websites which were interested in operating an authorised payday loan price comparison website. An average of 880,000 households a month took out a payday loan last year, according to research from consumer group Which? Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'The payday lending market has been rife with poor practice but today's proposals, alongside the Financial Conduct Authority's price cap and tougher supervision, are a step in the right direction to make lenders start to compete on price and treat customers fairly. 'We now want to see the regulators turning their attention to unfair practices and excessive fees in the wider credit market, including unauthorised overdrafts.' Clampdown: The payday industry has been looked up as part of a 20-month investigation aimed at making their businesses fairer and more transparent . March 2013: The UK's biggest payday lenders are threatened with being put out of business after a damning report uncovers evidence of 'widespread irresponsible lending'. The Office of Fair Trading's (OFT) report is the culmination of a large-scale probe into the sector, including spot-checks on household names such as Wonga. June 2013: The OFT refers payday lenders to the Competition Commission for a full-scale inquiry, saying it has found 'deep-rooted' problems. It finds some firms' business models appear to be based around customers taking out loans which they are forced to roll over because they cannot afford them. August 2013: The OFT says almost half the lenders who were ordered to prove their business practices are up to scratch have thrown in the towel, with 19 out of 50 firms it investigated deciding to call it a day. February 2014: City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) publishes a finalised set of rules for when it takes over supervision of the payday lending market in April, along with the rest of consumer credit. FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley says the rules will 'give us strong new powers to tackle any firm found to be overstepping the line'. March 2014: Payday lenders face a new inquiry to see how sympathetic they are when customers struggle to pay back their debts, the FCA announces. The FCA says it wants to see whether payday firms and other high-cost short-term lenders are putting too much focus on profits rather than consumers' interests. April 2014: Supervision of the whole payday lending industry passes from the OFT to the FCA. The FCA immediately starts putting its tough new rules into action, including forcing payday firms to provide financial health warnings in emails, online and in texts and signpost people to free debt help. June 2014: The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) releases provisional findings from its competition investigation and says that payday loan borrowers are paying around £60 a year over the odds because of problems shopping around. It suggests setting up an independent price comparison website for payday customers. The FCA announces that Wonga is to pay £2.6 million in compensation after chasing struggling customers with fake legal letters in order to pressurise them into paying up. Between October 2008 and November 2010, the firm sent correspondence to about 45,000 customers in arrears from non-existent law firms threatening legal action. July 2014: The payday industry comes under more new rules overseen by the FCA. From July 1, payday firms have to include risk warnings in television advertising. They are also banned from rolling over a loan more than twice and they will only be allowed to make two unsuccessful attempts to claw money back out of a borrower's account using a type of recurring payment known as a continuous payment authority. The FCA proposes a cap on payday lending, meaning that from January interest and fees on new loans, including those rolled over, must not exceed 0.8% per day of the amount borrowed. October 2014: Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announces plans that will force payday lenders to sell their products through impartial comparison websites as part of a new clampdown by the watchdog. November 2014: The FCA announces its new cap starting from January 2 . February 2015: The Competition and Markets Authority says payday lenders will have to put their deals on comparisons sites .","Interest rates for all payday lenders were capped at 100% from January 2 .
Wonga and others were sometimes charging up to 6000% APR on loans .

"Paris is on alert for a new terror attack  after 'at least' five drones were spotted illegally flying around city landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower, Bastille Square and the U.S. embassy building. Unmanned aircraft were also spotted flying overnight near the French capital's Place de la Concorde and the Invalides military museum, where Napoleon Bonaparte is buried. French security sources where unable to catch the operators of the drones, which are typically fitted with video recording equipment and can be used for surveillance of a terror target to assess security levels and any spikes in pedestrian football ahead of a planned attack. Fear: Drones were spotted flying near the Invalides military museum, where Napoleon Bonaparte is buried . Alert: Paris is on alert for a new terror attack after 'at least' five drones were spotted illegally flying around city landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower (right) and the U.S. embassy building (left) New threat: French law bans small, civilian drones from areas such as nuclear facilities, which are protected by a no-fly zone that spans a 1.6-mile radius and a height of 1,000 metres. The above drone crashed on the grass near the White House in the United States last month . The first drone sighting was near the US embassy in the French capital at around midnight. Between then and 6am the Eiffel Tower, Bastille Square, the Place de la Concorde and the Invalides military museum 'were also flown over' , a security source said. 'It could be a coordinated action but we don't know for now,' the source, who asked not to be identified, added. 'We did everything to try and catch the operators but they were not found,' another source close to the investigation said. France has experienced a series of mysterious drone appearances in the last few months. On January 20, a pilotless aircraft briefly went over the presidential palace in Paris, while around 20 drones were earlier seen flying above nuclear power plants. However until Tuesday 'there have never been so many drones appearing in one night,' the security source said. Location: At some point between midnight and 6am, drone aircraft were spotted flying near Bastille Square . Tourist hotspot: The first drone sighting in the French capital was around midnight. Shortly after an unmanned aircraft was seen flying near the Place de la Concorde . The emergence of drones comes amid warnings by terrorist groups that they will attack the city, following January shootings which left a total of 20 dead, including three terrorists. ‘They could be seen throughout the night, but nobody knows who were operating them,’ said a police source in the capital. A specialist police aviation unit tried to establish who was at the controls, but there have been no arrests. There have been other mysterious drone flights across Paris, but this is the first time that such a concentrated number have been seen above so many potentially vulnerable targets. The US embassy has been threatened by numerous groups in the past, from Al-Qaeda to Algeria’s Armed Islamic Group. French law bans small, civilian drones from areas such as nuclear facilities, which are protected by a no-fly zone that spans a 1.6-mile radius and a height of 1,000 metres. Despite a heightened security alert over the risk of Islamist attacks in France, police so far have been unable to identify who is behind the drone activity. Experts say that the small unmanned craft would not pose a threat if crashed into a hardened nuclear facility. Fightback: Earlier this month France unveiled its latest weapon against the growing menace of rogue drones buzzing through their nation's skies: another drone, with a net . Caught: In a demonstration in La Queue-en-Brie, east of Paris, the mesh-wielding flying machine was shown snaring a DJI Phantom 2 drone - the same brand as one which crashed onto the White House lawn last month . France has barred six 'would-be jihadists' from leaving the country after discovering their plans to travel to Syria and join the Islamic State terror group. It the first such travel ban under a new law aimed at preventing French Islamic radicals travelling to the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq currently under the control of Sunni extremists. French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve says some 40 other French citizens will face travel bans in the coming weeks. He did not reveal the identity of the six people whose passports have already been confiscated. The bans are the first since a sweeping anti-terrorism law passed in France last year. The government is especially worried since attacks in Paris last month killed 20 people, including three gunmen claiming ties to Islamic extremists in Syria and Yemen. An Interior Ministry official says the passports and ID cards of the six have been declared invalid for six months - a measure that can be extended for up to two years. The news comes just days after Cazeneuve said he asked Google, Facebook and Twitter to work directly with French officials during investigations and to immediately remove terrorist propaganda when authorities alert them to it. Earlier this month France unveiled its latest weapon against the growing menace of rogue drones buzzing through their nation's skies: another drone, with a net. In a demonstration flight in La Queue-en-Brie, east of Paris, the mesh-wielding flying machine was shown snaring a DJI Phantom 2 drone - the same brand as one which crashed onto the White House lawn last month. The U.S. Secret Service was sent scrambling by the unexpected intrusion, but France has already faced dozens of drone overflights over sensitive sites. Mystery drones have buzzed nuclear plants, military installations and even the presidential palace in recent months, as fears run high of terror attacks linked to the Islamic State terror group. Concerned at the new technology, officials have asked scientists and companies to develop ways to monitor and detect intruding drones and their remote-control pilots; analyse and track their flight paths; and ultimately neutralise the drones, either temporarily or permanently, with the least collateral damage possible. Last October it emerged that holidaymakers who are planning to fly a camera-equipped drone in Paris’ tourist zones risk spending time in jail and being slapped with a hefty fine. An Israeli tourist found out the hard way this week when he was arrested in front of Notre Dame Cathedral while flying a drone above some of Paris’ top attractions.","Unmanned aircraft were seen flying over tourist hotspots in French capital .

"Doctors said even just drinking half a glass of wine could stop babies breathing for up to two hours . Pregnant women are being urged not to drink at all after a study found that just half a glass of wine can stop their baby breathing and moving for up to two hours. The research, which reveals the dangers of just one unit of alcohol, flies in the face of NHS guidelines. These imply it is safe for pregnant women to continue drinking as long as it is not more than one or two units, once or twice a week. Experts claim British women are being given insufficient advice, and compared the toxins in alcohol to those in Thalidomide – the infamous drug for morning sickness that caused severe birth defects in the 1950s and 60s. Professor Peter Hepper, who carried out the study on the effects of low-level alcohol in pregnancy – the first of its kind in the UK – said: ‘If women drink just one unit of alcohol, the baby’s breathing and movement stop for up to two hours after that. That’s not normal – the baby should be continually active.’ The professor, from Queen’s University Belfast, looked at 18-week scans of pregnant women who drank on average two-and-a-half units a week – equivalent to a 200ml glass of wine. He noticed the foetuses stopped moving and breathing, then they suddenly jumped and turned themselves over. Speaking to ITV’s Exposure programme, which will air next week, he said the jolts suggested the babies’ brains were not developing properly. ‘The only safe [alcohol] level is zero,’ he added. Dr Mary Mather, a consultant paediatrician, said British women were being ‘deprived’ of information about the dangers of drinking while pregnant. In the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands, pregnant women are told not to drink at all. Dr Mather said: ‘Alcohol is a poison... it’s toxic to developing tissue. It’s also what doctors call a teratogen. The best known teratogen is Thalidomide. It’s in the same category of drugs.’ Sir Al Aynsley-Green, a professor of child health at University College London and a former Children’s Commissioner, said: ‘Exposure to alcohol before birth is the single most important preventable cause of incurable brain damage. Doctors compared drinking to the drug Thalidomide, prescribed to mothers in the 1950s and 60s who were prescribed the drug during pregnancy. Their babies were born with severe birth defects. Above, Simone Ilger, a Thalidomide survivor . ‘There is insufficient reliable information that can help women make these important decisions.’ It is estimated that as many as one in 100 babies born in Britain have physical defects or behavioural problems caused by their mother’s drinking. This is known as Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and the condition lasts for life. Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, is currently reviewing the guidelines on safe drinking for all adults, including pregnant women. Her new advice is due this summer. The Department of Health said: ‘Our advice is that pregnant women or women trying to conceive should avoid drinking alcohol. If they do choose to drink, to minimise the risk to the baby, they should not drink more than one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week and should not get drunk.’","NHS guidelines say pregnant women can drink one or two units at most .

Gaga, 28, was instantly attracted to 33-year-old Kinney's dark good looks and blue eyes when they met on location in Nebraska. But she was surprised when he planted an unscripted kiss on her lips during the shoot. 'There was a steamy scene between them, and Taylor just reached over and kissed her,' says the friend. 'When the director yelled, 'cut,' she asked him why he'd kissed her, since it wasn't part of the script, and he just gave her this sexy smile and walked off. She knew then and there they were going to hook up. 'These two are really in love. And they've found a way to make their relationship work despite the fact he's often stuck in Chicago shooting 'Fire,' and she's out on the road. 'They understand they are on two separate journeys and they allow each other the space to do what they have to do. That way, when they come back together, there are always fireworks.' According to the friend, the singer was totally taken by Taylor, who plays Lt. Kelly Severide on Chicago Fire. 'Taylor and Gaga are not only lovers, they are best friends,' says the pal. 'He is totally supportive of her career, her bizarre way of dressing and her freaky performances, and she loves the fact he's an adventurer who likes to surf, paddleboard, hike in the mountains, sky dive and ride fast motorcycles. She also appreciates his great sense of humor and she loves how he's super sexy, while still being so sensitive that he cries when she sings love songs.' Sensitive: Taylor posed for these sexy snaps and a friend tells Daily Mail Online that it's not only his sex apeal but his sentimental heart that won Gaga over . Taylor further endeared himself to his lady love in early 2013 when she broke her right hip and suffered a labral tear that required surgery. 'During the six months it took Stefani to recover, he was constantly by her side, pushing her around in the wheel chair and waiting on her hand and foot,' says another source. 'And he encouraged her to heal herself through exercise, yoga and meditation. She also loves the fact he fell in love with Stefani, not her famous Gaga persona.' The source says Gaga's parents, Joe and Cindy Germanotta, also adore Taylor. And they are thrilled over their daughter's engagement. 'Last fall, after three years of togetherness, Joe asked Taylor what his intentions towards his daughter were and the following weekend, Taylor booked a table at her parent's New York restaurant, Joanne Trattoria, and showed them he meant business.' In front of her folks, and a few close friends, Taylor announced it was his intention to marry Stefani, and that he wanted her parents to know he was serious. Then, on Valentine's Day he returned to the restaurant to purpose. Life follows art: Lady Gaga  portrayed a bride all in white while Kinney wears a white tuxedo forYou and I. It was on the set of the first video in July 2011 that Gaga first met the hunky actor . Bethrothed: Gaga proudly showed off her stunning heart-shaped diamond engagement ring on Monday after accepting her boyfriend Taylor Kinney's marriage proposal on Valentine's Day . Like aprayer: Gaga attended a service at the Grandview United Methodist Church in his hometown in Pennsylvania with Taylor in December . 'Taylor got down on one knee in front of Mr. and Mrs. Germanotta to ask for their daughter's hand in marriage,' says the source. 'Joe and Cindy were thrilled to be part of the proposal and Joe even brought out a few bottles of Dom Perignon Champagne to toast the occasion.' And a source says the happy couple can't wait to marry and have kids. 'Taylor and Stefani are planning to marry later this year,' says the source. 'And they want to have children right away. They would love to have at least three kids, because they both come from large families.' Super rich Stefani – who according to Forbes Magazine earned $33 million over the past eight months –  is obviously a real catch for her actor beau. 'But take one look at Taylor and you know right away that Gaga didn't do too badly either when it comes to finding love,' the source added.","Lady Gaga, aka Stefani Germanotta, got engaged to the hunky Chicago Fire actor on Valentine's day .

"Five British MI-5 officers testified in a Brooklyn court in wigs and makeup at the trial of accused al Qaeda operative Abid Naseer on Tuesday. A federal judge had approved the unusual attire in order to protect the agents’ identities and had also ruled that courtroom sketches of the officers must be portrayed with only 'blank faces' and 'generic hair'. The U.S. government has accused Naseer of taking part in a plot to carry out bombing attacks in the United States and Europe. Five British MI-5 officers testified in a Brooklyn court in wigs and makeup at the trial of accused al Qaeda operative Abid Naseer on Tuesday. A federal judge had  also ruled that courtroom sketches of the officers must be portrayed with only 'blank faces' and 'generic hair' A female agent – referred to Agent 1488 - gave evidence wearing a 50s style bob, heavy eye makeup and red lipstick. The agent, in her 20s, also wore glasses, black heeled boots and a revealing low-cut top as she described how she followed Naseer around Manchester and Liverpool in England in 2009. She also appeared to be adjusting her accent to further disguise her identity and mostly spoke in cut glass English - which occasionally sounded more working class. The other agents who gave evidence were all male and described how MI5 gave code names to Naseer's associates including 'Glass Pendant', 'Undercurrent' and 'Happy Skater'. The first agent was called 1661 and was an Asian man in his 20s who wore black wig with a side parting that was tucked behind his ears. He also wore glasses, a dark suit and had grown a beard. Under questioning by the prosecution, he spoke with a Northern accent and introduced himself as working for the 'British security services' as a surveillance officer. One of the other agents was also an Asian man in his 20s who was identified as agent 1498, who wore a ruffled black wig, glasses and a dark suit. One of the other agents was also an Asian man in his 20s who was identified as agent 1498, who wore a ruffled black wig, glasses and a dark suit . Rather than appearing behind screens, the judge had decided to was better for the officers to wear disguises so that jury members could see their facial expressions and body language, and thus assess their credibility. U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie had also ordered media sketch artists at the trial of Pakistani-born Naseer to refrain from detailed portrayals of the officers with Britain's domestic counterintelligence agency, calling them 'committed, lifelong operatives.' 'The situation is grave,' Dearie said in a court hearing. He had earlier told prosecutors not to go overboard with the disguises because ‘I don’t want situation comedy in the courtroom’. Prosecutors have called their testimony essential, saying their surveillance of Naseer from 2009 made them the only witnesses to activities he undertook to prepare for an attack in Manchester, England, which ultimately was never carried out. The first agent was called 1661 and was an Asian man in his 20s who wore black wig with a side parting that was tucked behind his ears. He also wore glasses, a dark suit and had grown a beard . Dearie had previously at prosecutors' urging approved a variety of steps aimed at protecting the officers' identities, including identifying them only through numbers and the use of wigs and 'light' make-up. Dearie's order that artists draw Naseer with 'blank faces, generic hair,' came despite objections from some members of the media who called the wigs protection enough. But Zainab Ahmad, a prosecutor, said not all of the officers would be wearing wigs. Naseer, 28, faces up to life in prison if convicted of providing and conspiring to provide material support to al Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device. Prosecutors say Naseer was leader of an al Qaeda cell plotting an attack on Manchester. Naseer is accused by the U.S. government of taking part in a plot to carry out bombing attacks in the United States and Europe . Another cell conspired to bomb the New York City subway system, while a third planned to attack a Copenhagen newspaper. Naseer was initially arrested in Britain in 2009 along with a dozen men on suspicion of plotting the Manchester attack. No charges were brought, and a British court blocked Naseer's deportation. Naseer was re-arrested by British authorities in 2010 after the United States indicted him, leading to his extradition in 2013. Naseer, who faces life in prison if convicted, is representing himself. He has pleaded not guilty and has said he went online and used email to find a wife, not contact an al-Qaeda handler.","Five British MI-5 officers are set to testify in wigs and makeup in the New York trial of accused al Qaeda operative Abid Naseer on Tuesday .

"A controversial scheme to pay GPs £55 for every new case of dementia on their books is leading to patients being wrongly told they may have the devastating illness, researchers warn. The initiative was launched by the NHS in the autumn to boost shockingly low detection rates and meet ambitious targets. Leading doctors and campaigners branded it ‘unethical’ and warned patients would be wrongly labelled as having dementia. Now researchers at the University of Sheffield say there is evidence these concerns have been realised. Researchers have warned that a controversial scheme to pay GPs £55 for every new case of dementia on their books is leading to patients being wrongly diagnosed. Stock photo . They have found that the number of ‘inaccurate’ referrals by GPs to memory clinics – centres to diagnose dementia – has doubled since the scheme was introduced. A study of 150 patients found that just over half – 52 per cent – who had been sent to memory clinics for scans since October were later found not to have dementia. This compares to rates of between 25 and 30 per cent before the scheme was introduced. Many had temporary memory problems brought on by depression or old age rather than dementia. Lead researcher Dr Daniel Blackburn, consultant neurologist at the University of Sheffield, said the initiative may be having a ‘devastating consequence’ on patients and families. The scheme sees practices paid £55 for every new case of dementia recorded on their lists by the end of March. GPs can either make a diagnosis themselves following a series of detailed questions or send patients to memory clinics for scans. But neither system is accurate so it follows that as more patients are sent for tests, the higher the chance of more people being misdiagnosed. Researchers are also concerned that as GPs refer more patients to memory clinics, waiting times increase ever further for those who genuinely do have the illness and need treatment. Dr Blackburn, whose study was uncovered by Pulse magazine, said: ‘We already know there are long waiting lists to be seen and if you send more people who don’t have dementia into those clinics … it slows down the process. ‘But also I think there is a risk that if we don’t analyse patients carefully enough then we are going to give people a false diagnosis.’ Meanwhile Dr Martin Brunet, a GP in Guildford, Surrey, said there was ‘no way of knowing if doctors have gamed the system’. He added: ‘Consider also that someone might have dementia, but the GP knows the memory clinic won’t turn them around before the end of March. ‘What would you do in that situation? Tell yourself that’s bad luck that the memory clinic has such a long waiting list in your area, or code them as dementia now, knowing that after the end of March you can always change the code if the specialist diagnoses something else.’ Figures show that the number of patients diagnosed with dementia has increased seven-fold since the scheme was introduced. There were nearly 35,000 recorded cases in the five months since October 2014 compared to 4,600 between April and September 2014. A study of 150 patients found that just over half who had been sent to memory clinics for scans since October were later found not to have dementia. Stock photo . Currently, around 850,000 adults in Britain have dementia but only 45 per cent have been formally diagnosed with the illness. NHS England say the scheme is only a temporary measure to improve detection rates and will stop after the end of March. Professor Alistair Burns, NHS England's national clinical director for dementia, said: 'High quality, accurate and timely diagnosis of dementia allows people to access the emotional, practical and financial support they need. 'There is absolutely no evidence to suggest the £55 scheme is leading to patients being wrongly diagnosed by GPs. 'The small study of patients visiting a memory clinic in Sheffield in 2012/13 was carried out long before the introduction of the temporary £55 financial incentive for GPs, launched in late 2014. 'It is highly unlikely a patient would be told they have dementia if the GP was not certain - if there is any doubt, the patient will be referred for a further assessment to determine the diagnosis, as is clearly happening in Sheffield.' Last week it emerged that GPs could win bonuses for prescribing fewer antibiotics. Health bosses fear the drugs are being handed out so freely that they are losing their effectiveness and they claim cash incentives will help curb their use.","Initiative was launched by the NHS to boost shockingly low detection rates .

"From Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's beloved green juice to Miranda Kerr's favourite Noni juice, the two models are walking adverts for the power of vitamins and super fruits. When the A-listers came out in support of clean juices, the world converted to all things green quicker than you could say kale. And now, a new beauty drink that claims to boost your health and your beauty regime in one hit is set to take the health world by storm (and the models backstage at fashion week have already jumped on the bandwagon). Miranda Kerr, left, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley have long preached the power of the green juice. And now, one Spanish company are combining the power of superfoods and anti-ageing benefits of collagen into a tipple that claims to boost your health and beat wrinkles . Beauty & Go is a range of drinks packed with bioactives - biologically active substances that have a positive effect in your body and skin. The drinks, which are gluten-free, claim to be filled with a selection of bioactive ingredients aimed at keeping your skin healthy and glowing. The ingredients, which are called Macro-Antioxidants and occur naturally in the skin of fruits such as olives and pomegranates, aim to protect cells against  free radicals (the main cause of ageing), as well as stimulate skin regeneration and boost skin’s firmness and elasticity. The brand's researchers claim the effect of Macro-Antioxidants on our system is long-lasting (three times longer than conventional antioxidants). Beauty & Go is a range of drinks that are packed with bioactives - biologically active substances that have a positive effect in your body and skin - and superfoods such as spirulina algae, rosehip and ginkgo biloba . The tipples, which contain under 100 calories and are made by a Spanish company, are also enriched with other beauty ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and collagen, which are well-known for their skin firming properties. As well as the wrinkle-beating ingredients, the drinks, which cost £2.99 each and are launching in Selfridges in March, are full of celebrity-approved superfoods. They are sweetened using stevia - a natural plant extract. It seems that the trend for beauty-boosting drinks is taking off and Beauty & Go aims to combine the nation's penchant for health drinks with beauty benefits . There are four options and the anti-ageing and radiance ones claims to be packed with ingredients to help beat wrinkles and keep skin glowing. The detox variety is akin to a green juice and, say the brand, will be your greatest ally when your skin needs to recover from a few days of excess. It promises to help stimulate metabolism and contribute to toxin elimination, thanks to cucumber, spirulina algae, broccoli, spinach, mint and nettle. The vitality option, meanwhile, contains pineapple, ginkgo biloba and guarana and claims to boost energy levels. The makers suggest drinking one a day for a month to see results, but are the drinks just another health fad promising the key to eternal youth? Michela Vagnini, Nutritional Therapist at Nature’s Plus, isn't convinced. 'This drinks range looks more marketing-based than science-based,' she said. 'The website states the drinks have been used in a clinical trial but the only information on the website points to a 56-day trial of only 30 people. ‘The website mentions Macro-Antioxidants are used but it doesn't specify which anti-oxidants are included. Antioxidant is a general name that by itself means very little.' It seems that the trend for beauty-boosting drinks is taking off. Beauty’in beauty drink offers a similar anti-ageing infusion, which is full of hibiscus, grape and acai and collagen, designed to keep skin looking healthy. Neal's Yard Remedies offer a similar new product - but theirs comes in powder form and can be used to make up a drink or added to juices and smoothies. The brand's Organic Greens Complex is apparently packed full of vitamin C with ingredients like acerola cherry, which is renowned for its collagen boosting properties. It also is full of spirulina, spinach and parsley powder.","Beauty & Go is a range of drinks that are packed with bioactives .

"The 36-year-old man arrested on suspicion of raping Karen Danczuk says he feels as though he is part of an 'X Factor sob story'. The suspect, who cannot be named for legal reasons, says he was left 'shaking with fear' after being arrested on Sunday over child abuse claims made by the 31-year-old. Mrs Danczuk, the wife of crusading anti-child sex abuse MP Simon, revealed last week that she was allegedly raped and sexually assaulted 'hundreds of times' as a child at her family home in Manchester. The 36-year-old man arrested in connection with sex abuse allegations made by MP's wife Karen Danczuk (pictured left and right) said he feels as though he is part of an 'X Factor sob story' Mrs Danczuk, pictured with her Labour MP husband Simon, said she was abused from the age of six . After some members of family disputed her version of events, Mrs Danczuk reported the allegations to police, who arrested the suspect at his home in Rochdale. Speaking from his home, which is just a few miles from where Mrs Danczuk lives, he told The Sun: 'I feel like I am living in a soap opera - that's the best way to describe it. It's not real.' He added: 'Everyone likes an X Factor sob story don't they? It's seems to be the way of the world these days.' The man, who was questioned for six hours, has been bailed by Greater Manchester Police until April 30. Mrs Danczuk, who has became well known for Twitter selfies showing off her cleavage, claims the abuse took place between 1989 and 1995 when she was aged between six and 11. She told how her selfies were rooted in the abuse she suffered as a child and are a defiant way of reclaiming control over her alleged attacker. Mrs Danczuk said she was regularly abused in the bedroom of her family home in Middleton, Greater Manchester, shortly after her parents' marriage broke up. Mrs Danczuk claims the repeated abuse took place in the bedroom of her family home in Greater Manchester . In response to the arrest, Mrs Danczuk tweeted that she would never forgive those who doubted her claims . Her father Martin Burke, now 73, moved out, leaving Mrs Danczuk, three older brothers and an older sister living with their mother Susan Burke. Mrs Danczuk's claims were branded a 'figment of her imagination' by her mother Susan Burke (pictured) But Mrs Danczuk's claims were branded a 'figment of her imagination' by her mother, as well as two of her four siblings who challenged her story. Mrs Burke, 58, called her daughter an 'attention-seeker'. The war of words led Mrs Danczuk to report her claims to the police 'as a matter of urgency, to prove I am telling the truth'. After news of the arrest, the mother-of-two tweeted: 'For all those who doubted me, publicly slated me & made me feel like scum for coming out. I will NEVER forgive & NEVER forget!' She later said she felt 'more numb than angry' and her rage is instead directed at her mother. She said: 'I am not a fantasist. I am telling the truth. I was raped or sexually abused hundreds of times. 'She did nothing to protect me and I will never forgive her.' Asked why she had waited two decades to name her attacker, she said: 'Because I am still coming to terms with it. It is a very difficult thing to confront – as any paedophile victim will know.' DI Caroline Ward of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We work hard to support victims of sexual offences and thoroughly investigate all reports of sexual abuse and rape no matter how long ago they happened. 'We will do everything we can to support victims and bring offenders to justice.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Karen Danczuk says she was raped as a child at family's Manchester home .

"‘Double wife killer’ Harold Henthorn is fighting to keep a $1.5million life insurance payout from a policy taken out on his second wife, whom he is accused of murdering. Henthorn was charged with the murder of second wife, Toni Bertolet, 51, last November and police have reopened their investigation into the suspicious death of his first wife some 20 years earlier. Both women died in ‘freak’ accidents to which Henthorn, 59, was the sole witness. Dr Toni Jill Bertolet plunged 140ft to her death shortly before her 12th wedding anniversary while hiking with Henthorn in a remote stretch of Rocky Mountain National Park. Lynn Rishell - his first wife - was crushed to death under the front of Henthorn’s Jeep when, he told first responders, the jack gave way as she reached under the vehicle for a lug night while changing a flat tire in the dark. In both cases Henthorn was named as the sole beneficiary in a string of lucrative life insurance policies totalling $500,000 on the death of his first wife and $4.5million on the death of his second. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Married: Harold and Toni Henthorn with their daughter. The couple were married for 12 years and her life was insured against death when she feel 140ft and died in the Rockies. He claimed it was an accident . Scene: Deer Mountain in the Rocky Mountains National Park in Colorado, where the couple were hiking at the time of the 'freak accident' which claimed her life. He is now on trial for murder . First wife: Harold and Lynn Henthorn on their wedding day. She died in what he said was a freak accident but his trial for the alleged murder of his second wife will hear claims the 'accident' was also murder . Now court documents seen by DailyMail.com and filed as part of a civil case in Colorado have revealed that Henthorn is fighting a case brought by American General Life Insurance Company for a $1.5million policy taken out on Dr Bertolet. Submitted to the court as Exhibit A, the policy gives the reason for taking out such a substantial coverage as ‘Estate planning and income protection/planning to have children’. Henthorn has not relinquished the claim he made in September 2013, one year after his wife’s death the previous September. He cited cause of death as ‘Accidental Fall.’ At the time of making this claim Henthorn was unaware that he was under investigation by the FBI who painstakingly scrutinized every aspect of the widower’s life across two years before swooping and arresting him in November last year. But an autopsy carried out on Dr Bertolet had already concluded that she ‘died as a result of multiple blunt force injuries when she fell or was pushed down a cliff’. The manner of death was noted as ‘undetermined,’ by the coroner who stated: ‘Homicide cannot be excluded.’ Now, in its case against Henthorn, American General Life Insurance Company has asked the court to decide what should be done with the $1.5million currently being held by the court. And shockingly, in a separate motion, court documents filed just last week show that Henthorn fought his late wife’s family to have funds from Dr Bertolet’s estate released into his possession. As well as owning her own successful practice, ophthalmologist Dr Bertolet had two further life insurance policies taken out in her name. Last February the District Court of Douglas County, Colorado found in her family’s favor and barred Henthorn from accessing his late wife’s estate on the grounds that allowing him to do so posed an ‘imminent risk of substantial harm…to [its] financial interests.’ But newly filed documents reveal that Henthorn attempted to have these funds released into his possession as recently as December. He only finally failed in his bid last month, when a court denied him access to the funds, and demanded that he appoint a forensic accountant to detail the contents of his late wife’s estate. Last month DailyMail.com revealed that, in 2009, Henthorn also took out a life insurance policy on his sister-in-law Grace Rishell who was married to his first wife’s brother. Verdict: Harold and Toni Henthorn before her death. An autopsy carried out on Dr Bertolet  concluded that she ‘died as a result of multiple blunt force injuries when she fell or was pushed down a cliff’. Survived: Toni henthorn left behind a daughter, Hayley, who was seven when she died. The $1.5 million policy at the center of the legal dispute was for ‘estate planning and income protection/planning to have children’. Payout: Harold Henthorn and Lynn, whose death, supposedly when their Jeep fell on top of her while jacked up, resulted in $500,000 in insurance payouts. It is not known if this is the car which claimed her life . Grace Rishell was going through a divorce and ‘concerned for her financial stability,’ when she initially agreed to Henthorn taking out a policy that would pay $50,000 to Grace’s brother and each of her four daughters for a total of $250,000. According to prosecutors in Dr Bertolet’s murder case, ‘the evidence will show that Henthorn had a romantic interest in Rishell’. But Rishell had a change of heart in spring 2010 and told the insurance agent to stop the policy from going through. Instead she took out a policy of her own with another insurer. Unbeknownst to her ‘her signature was forged to procure the original policy as well,’ with Henthorn making payments on the policy until December 2012 and listing himself as sole beneficiary. The policy was cancelled in 2013 when the insurer concluded that Henthorn had no insurable interest in Rishell. But the very fact of its existence raises the specter that Henthorn had Rishell in his sights as a third potential victim. Henthorn was arrested on November 6 when FBI apprehended him as he returned home after dropping his nine-year-old daughter, Hayley, at school. His indictment was the result of a prolonged investigation during which the FBI eavesdropped on his telephone conversations, combed through his finances, scrutinized his employment history and concluded that the ‘freak’ hiking accident that claimed the mother-of-one’s life was murder. College days: Harold Henthorn and Lynn Rishell when he was a new geology graduate from Virginia. The couple moved to Colorado, where after 12 years of marriage, she died in a 'freak accident', now said to be murder . He was denied bail by US District Judge Kathleen Latoyfa who described him as a ‘danger’ and said, ‘there are rather glaring similarities between the loss of his first wife and the loss of his second’ and pointed to large sums of money recently transferred by Henthorn to his brother as suggestive that he was ‘hiding funds.’ Though Henthorn claimed to work as a fundraiser for a charity the economic crime auditor for the US Attorney found no evidence that the geology graduate from Virginia had any earnings other than some in 1993, 1999 and 2000. The only job he appears to have had was one briefly held in the petroleum industry – the job that saw him and his then new bride, Lynn Rishell, move from their hometown of Harrington, Virginia, across the country to Colorado. The prosecution’s case against Henthorn highlights the similarities between both his wives’ passing – not least the substantial windfall both saw him set to receive. Both ‘freak accidents’ occurred at remote locations with Henthorn the lone witness. Both occurred after about 12 years of marriage and Henthorn told wildly varying stories about both deaths. Prepared: Harold Henthorn was said to have made nine different trips to the area around Rocky Mountain Park in the summer before his wife died . According to prosecution documents Henthorn even told a Sunday school class that his first wife died of cancer and that she lost a baby she was carrying to chemotherapy. In the case of his second wife, two years before her death Dr Bertolet almost died when she was struck by a wooden beam Henthorn had thrown off the deck of their cottage. After that incident Henthorn joked to friends, ‘I was trying to kill my wife.’ Investigators have also established that Henthorn ‘extensively scouted’ the fatal hike trail. Contrary to what he told law enforcement he made nine different trips to the area around Rocky Mountain Park that summer. The fortnight before their anniversary – the date of her death – Henthorn had hiked six trails to ‘find the perfect one for the trip.’ And damningly a map found in his car showed the spot where Dr Bertolet fell to her death, marked with a pink X. In both Lynn Rishell and Dr Toni Jill Bertolet’s deaths Henthorn was eager to have his wives’ bodies cremated quickly despite family requests against it and, disturbingly, he spread both women’s ashes on the same mountain near Ouray, Colorado. A hearing for the civil case is scheduled for April while a trial date of May 4 -15 has been set for the murder case to which Henthorn has entered a not guilty plea.","Harold Henthorn is charged with murdering his second wife in criminal trial which will also hear that he killed his first wife .

"Defying the Republican-run Congress, President Barack Obama rejected a bill Tuesday to approve construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, wielding his veto power for only the third time in his presidency. Obama offered no indication of whether his State Department will eventually issue a permit for the pipeline, whose construction has become a flashpoint in the U.S. debate about environmental policy and climate change. Instead, Obama sought to reassert his authority to make the decision himself, rebuffing GOP lawmakers who will control both the House and Senate for the remainder of the president's term. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama, seen here during a meeting with Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani at Oval Office of the White House on Tuesday, formally vetoed legislation approving construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline this afternoon . 'The presidential power to veto legislation is one I take seriously,' Obama said in a brief notice delivered to the Senate. 'But I also take seriously my responsibility to the American people.' Obama vetoed the bill in private with no fanfare, in contrast to the televised ceremony Republican leaders staged earlier this month when they signed the bill and sent it to the president. House Speaker John Boehner said Republicans were 'not even close' to giving up the fight and derided the veto as a 'national embarrassment.' The move sends the politically charged issue back to Congress, where Republicans haven't shown they can muster the two-thirds majority in both chambers needed to override Obama's veto. North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, the bill's chief GOP sponsor, said Republicans are about four votes short in the Senate and need about 11 more in the House. Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that he would try to bring more Democrats over to his party's side on the issue in an attempt to overturn Obama's veto by March 3. 'Even though the President has yielded to powerful special interests, this veto doesn’t end the debate,' McConnell said. 'Americans should know that the new Congress won’t stop pursuing good ideas, including this one.' Although the veto is Obama's first since Republicans took control on Capitol Hill, it was not likely to be the last. GOP lawmakers are lining up legislation rolling back Obama's actions on health care, immigration and financial regulation that Obama has promised to similarly reject. 'He's looking at this as showing he still can be king of the hill, because we don't have the votes to override,' Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, a vocal opponent of Obama's climate change agenda, said in an interview with the Associated Press. 'If he vetoed this, he's going to veto many others that are out there.' First proposed more than six years ago, the Keystone XL pipeline project has sat in limbo ever since, awaiting a permit required by the federal government because it would cross an international boundary. The pipeline would connect Canada's tar sands with refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast that specialize in processing heavy crude oil. Republicans and the energy industry say the $8 billion project would create jobs, spur growth and increase America's independence from Mideast energy sources. Democrats and environmental groups have sought to make the pipeline a poster child for the type of dirty energy sources they say are exacerbating global warming. 'This misguided Keystone XL bill, pushed by the fossil fuel industry, has met its just and expected doom,' Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement following news of Obama's veto. 'The president got it exactly right,' she said. 'Congress should stop wasting any more time pushing dirty energy projects that would worsen climate change and threaten our air, water and land.' On behalf of Friends of the Earth, the organization's president, Erich Pica, also thanked Obama for striking down the Keystone legislation. 'The veto sends a strong message to Congress that the government should represent the interests of the American people instead of Big Oil.' House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, seated, held a public ceremony to sign the bill authorizing expansion of the Keystone XL pipeline just before Congress left for a week-long recess on Feb. 13. Republicans did not send the legislation to Obama until Tuesday, however. He quickly vetod it in private. It was only the third veto of Obama's presidency . For his part, Obama says his administration is still weighing the pipeline's merits, and he has repeatedly threatened to veto any attempts by lawmakers to make the decision for him. The president's spokesman told reporters today that the veto was not the president taking 'a specific position on the pipeline itself.' Rather, it is him handing off the decision to experts within the administration. 'It does not represent a final disposition of the Keystone project,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. In a statement to Congress today explaining his veto, Obama said he was opposing the bill because 'this act of Congress conflicts with established executive branch procedures and cuts short thorough consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest -- including our security, safety, and environment.' That message was all but lost on Republicans, who accused Obama in a barrage of attacks on Tuesday, of playing politics and kowtowing to environmental groups. Recently elected Georgia Sen. David Perdue called the president's veto 'ridiculous.' Louisiana's senior senator, David Vitter, contended that the move was 'just sheer political spite.' The Senate GOP Conference sent reporters an email blasting Obama as the 'obstructor in chief.' 'There is simply no reason whatsoever for the president not to approve this project that will create thousands of jobs for American workers and put our country one step closer to energy independence,' Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander said. Texas Rep. Bill Flores said Obama was putting the 'priorities of radical environmentalists ahead of the needs and priorities of hardworking American families. 'President Obama's veto is a triumph of politics over common sense,' Pennsylvania Rep. Lou Barletta said. 'His own State Department completed five reviews, totaling more than 22,000 pages, and concluded that the Keystone XL Pipeline is a project that will create jobs, and actually improve safety and the environment. 'The only possible reason to oppose the project is politics,' he concluded. The president's spokesman told reporters today that the veto was not the president taking 'a specific position on the pipeline itself.' Rather, it is him handing off the decision to experts within the administration . The GOP-controlled House passed the bill earlier in February on a 270-152 vote, following weeks of debate and tweaks in the Senate to insert language stating that climate change is real and not a hoax. Republican leaders in Congress delayed sending the bill to the White House until they returned from a weeklong recess, ensuring they would be on hand to denounce the president when he vetoed the bill. The veto forced Republicans, still reveling in their dramatic gains in the midterm elections, to confront the limitations of being unable to turn their ideas into law without the president's consent - despite the fact they now control both chambers of Congress. Republican leaders were mulling a number of potential next steps. In addition to trying to peel off enough Democrats to override Obama's veto - an unlikely proposition - Republicans were considering inserting Keystone into other critical legislation dealing with energy, spending or infrastructure in hopes that Obama would be less likely to veto those priorities, Hoeven, said. 'We'll look to see if we can get some more bipartisan support,' the North Dakota lawmaker noted. Obama last wielded his veto power in October 2010, nixing a relatively mundane bill dealing with recognition of documents notarized out of state. With the Keystone bill, Obama's veto count stands at just three - far fewer than most of his predecessors. Yet his veto threats have been piling up rapidly since Republicans took full control of Congress, numbering more than a dozen so far this year. The president has said he won't approve Keystone if it's found to significantly increase U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas blamed for global warming. A State Department analysis found that the tar sands would be developed one way or another, meaning construction of the pipeline wouldn't necessarily affect emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency earlier this month called for that analysis to be revisited, arguing that a drop in oil prices may have altered the equation.","It is only the third veto of Obama's presidency; with Republicans now in control of both chambers of Congress it's unlikely to be his last .
The White House had said many times that the president would not sign the legislation - he believes the State Department should make the decision .
The veto was not the president taking 'a specific position on the pipeline itself,' Obama's spokesman told reporters today .

"Google and Apple already want to be in your pocket and on your wrist, and for their next battle the rivals are gunning for your car's dashboard. 2015 will be the year Android Auto and Apple's CarPlay systems roll out to more cars and reach the mainstream.

Android Auto works with any Android phone to show a user's information on the dashboard (Google Maps on Android Auto pictured) Apple first toyed with an in-car system at its Worldwide Developer Conference in June 2013. At that point it was known as 'iOS in the Car' but following changes in the design team the system was officially unveiled at last year's Geneva Motor Show, under the moniker CarPlay. Google used its own annual developer I/O in June to unveil Android Auto, a key feature of its latest operating system Android Lollipop. Android Auto works with any Android Lollipop phone to show information on the dashboard. In April, Texas researchers found that using voice to send text messages while driving - on software such as Apple's Siri - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers. They found both methods impacted . driver response times equally - but it often took voice . recognition users longer to fix mistakes with their messages. While a separate study from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in the US, discovered that hands-free kits increase mental workload and distractions, causing reaction times to get slower and brain function to become compromised. This results in drivers scanning the road less and potentially not seeing items right in front of them, including pedestrians. Rather than running its own operating system, the unit acts an external display for connected devices. The software automatically starts when a user plugs in their phone, and Google has subsequently demonstrated how maps, Google Now cards and music will appear on the car's built-in screen through a series of promotional videos and trailers. Android Auto uses voice control for navigation, using Google Maps, and can read and reply to messages. Music is accessed through Google Play or the phone's music library. Certain models of car will have a voice-activation button on the wheel, while others will respond automatically to 'OK Google.' At the launch, Google's Patrick Brady said the firm will allow developers to build cars apps for audio and messaging applications and has signed up more than 28 car makers. These include Abarth, Acura, Alfa Romeo, Audi, Bentley, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Jeep, Kia, Maserati, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Opel, Ram, Renault, Seat, Skoda, Subaru, Suzuki, Volkswagen and Volvo. The first wave of Android Auto cars are 'coming soon', but they are expected to launch this year. Apple's integrated CarPlay system works in an almost identical way. Plugging an iPhone into the car starts the system. It works with the iPhone 5 up to the iPhone 6 Plus running iOS 7 and above, and features Siri Eyes Free - a voice-activated, hands-free way to use the system with Apple's Siri software. Once connected, Siri can be used to access the phone’s contacts, make calls, return missed calls and listen to voicemails. Navigation uses Apple Maps, and music can be played through apps including Apple's own Beats Music, iHeartRadio, Spotify and Stitcher. Both systems work with connected handsets and let drivers control maps, make calls (CarPlay pictured), open and respond to texts and play music using voice commands. In Apple CarPlay this is called Siri Eyes Free. CarPlay is compatible with the iPhone 5 and above while Android Auto works with Android Lollipop .

Many car manufacturers will also include touchscreen controls, plus physical knobs and controls in their vehicles. The first car to be sold with a fully-functioning version of CarPlay was Ferrari's FF unveiled in September. Earlier this month Hyundai confirmed its Sonata sedan will have the features by the end of March. Other partners include Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Audi, BMW, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Citroen including its DS branch, Dodge, Fiat, Honda, Jaguar, Jeep, Kia, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, Renault, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo. Certain models of car (Kia example pictured) will have a voice-activation button on the wheel, while others will respond automatically to spoken commands such as 'OK Google' And by 2016 all new Ford models are expected to have either Android Auto or CarPlay built-in. But despite the promises from both firms in terms of adding easy-to-use, hands-free features, a recent study from Texas Transportation Institute found the technology may be as dangerous as texting.

Other CarPlay and Android Auto partners include Abarth, Audi, BMW, Mitsubishi, Volkswagen and Volvo (CarpPlay on a Volvo car pictured). By 2016, all Fords are expected to have either Android or CarPlay built-in . While a separate study from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in the US, discovered that hands-free kits increase mental workload and distractions, causing reaction times to get slower and brain function to become compromised. CarPlay works with the iPhone 5 up to the iPhone 6 Plus running iOS 7 and iOS 8 (pictured) This results in drivers scanning the road less and potentially not seeing items right in front of them, including pedestrians. Apple has not commented on the findings, but during a demonstration of Google's technology Andrew Brenner, the lead project manager of Android Auto, told the New York Times that no action on the system should take more than two seconds. This was designed to comply with the Transportation Department’s voluntary guidelines. For example, there is no Back or Recents button, and the font on Google Maps is larger and less detailed to be less distracting. Video streaming is blocked, as is most social media, and texts will only be sent using voice commands. And with the latest rumours about Apple's electric, self-driving car project Titan, both dashboard systems could be just the next step towards vehicles running solely on Android or iOS. Android Auto will also take advantage of Google Now (example pictured). Google Now scans calendar entries to work out where a user is, or should be. It combines this with location data from the phone's GPS, as well as posts on social networks and email. It then shows Cards designed to offer support it thinks the user needs . Apple said many cars will also include touchscreen controls, plus physical knobs and controls to make controlling CarPlay as easy as possible without distracting the driver. A recent study from Texas Transportation Institute found the technology may be as dangerous as texting . Reports claim Apple has several hundred employees developing its own electric car at a secret lab. Speculation was rife earlier this month when an Apple-owned car was spotted driving around California fitted with Street View-style cameras. Further cars were spotted in Florida and Hawaii. If Apple was developing such technology, it would would rival Google's self-driving cars. Google's head of self-driving cars recently said he expects people to be using them on public roads in two to five years. Chris Urmson added the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians.

Other concerns around Android Auto, CarPlay and both firms entering the car market involve privacy and tracking. Following users on their phones, into their cars as well as their homes, campaigners are worried the tech giants will have access to a wealth of personal information. But Mr Brenner responded: 'It’s exactly the same as having it in your pocket in your phone because it is on your phone. So the same privacy controls that we have already for Google Now and for other third-party applications exist for this as well.'","2015 will see Android Auto and Apple's CarPlay rolling out to more cars .

"Children in Canada as young as six will learn about the age of consent while eight-year-olds will introduced to the ideas of same-sex relationships. The topics will be discussed as part of a revamped sex-education curriculum in the province of Ontario that hasn't been updated for 17 years - long before the invention of the smartphone. Parents have been voicing their unhappiness at some of the topics on the agenda with some threatening to pull their children out of class on the grounds that it is 'too early' for such discussions to take place. However, the new curriculum actually brings Ontario in line with other Canadian provinces. Scroll down for video... Now, listen! Education Minister Liz Sandals (pictured) says Ontario kids as young as six will learn about consent while eight-year-olds will be taught about same-sex relationships under the revamped curriculum . Update: The document – last updated in 1998 before smartphone were invented – brings Ontario in line with other provinces . 'The world had changed a lot in the last 15 years. Concepts such as smartphones, SnapChat and sexting were not familiar to anyone, let alone students,' Education Minister Liz Sandals told a  news conference. 'Today, we live in a digital and interconnected world where information is literally at our fingertips around the clock. Students have instant access to quite explicit information from unreliable, inaccurate and often offensive sources. This is why it's so important to ensure that our children have the right information.' In first grade - age six and seven, students will learn how to understand non-verbal signals like facial expressions and tone of voice, as well as the proper names for body parts. Students in second grade will learn about the stages of development and related bodily changes along with the concept that 'no means no.' Lesson plan: Grade 1 students will learn how to understand non-verbal signals like facial expressions and tone of voice, as well as the proper names for body parts . Syllabus: Children in Grades 4 and up will learn more about the dangers of online bullying and of posting or sharing sexual images, while specific lessons on the dangers of sexting will come in Grade 7 . By Grade 3 (age eight and nine), students will learn about same-sex relationships, in an effort to help children with two moms or two dads feel their families are just like everyone else's, provincial officials say. Children in Grades 4 and up will learn more about the dangers of online bullying and of posting or sharing sexual images, while specific lessons on the dangers of sexting will come in Grade 7 - age 12 and 13. Students in Grade 6 will be taught about masturbation and 'gender expression,' while kids in Grades 7 and 8 will discuss contraception, anal and oral sex, preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Education minister Liz Sandals says she realized some believe it is too early but doesn't believe many will ban their kids from attending the classes. 'Given that we haven't had hoards of people withdrawing from the public education system given what's already in the curriculum, to be perfectly honest, I don't anticipate that affect now,' she told Global News. The new curriculum pays particular attention to  gender identify and teaches children from a very young age that they may not be the gender of their body and that there may be six genders. Thumbs up: Planned Parenthood praised the inclusion of consent, the lessons about online activities, as well as the decision to teach about puberty at an earlier grade. (pictured, Education Minister Liz Sandals) The government is also publishing online parents' guides to the new curriculum to help them integrate their conversations at home with what will be taught in the classroom. 'Peers, romantic partners or even strangers can pressure or coerce a young person to participate in sexting,' the parents' guide to the sexting portion of the curriculum says. 'Once a person sends a sext, they lose control of it.' Children in Grades 1 through 3 will learn about 'respectful communications,' while those in 4 to 6 will learn about 'the risks of posting or sharing sexual images or information.' The Ontario Physical and Health Education Association called the curriculum update long overdue and cautioned critics against overreacting. The updated curriculum will be in place for the start of classes in September. Planned Parenthood praised the inclusion of consent in the revised curriculum, the lessons about online activities, as well as the decision to teach about puberty earlier, switching to grade 4 from grade 5. Grade 1: Identify body parts, including genitalia, using correct terminology. Recognize caring and exploitative behaviors. Grade 2: Outline the basic stages of human development. Describe how to relate positively to others and behaviours that can be harmful in relating to others, including both online and face-to-face name calling. Grade 3: Identify the characteristics of healthy relationships, including those with friends, siblings and parents. Describe how visible differences, such as skin colour, and invisible differences, including gender identity and sexual orientation, make each person unique. Develop safety guidelines for Internet use. Grade 4: Describe the physical changes that occur at puberty, as well as the emotional and social impacts. Demonstrate an understanding of personal hygienic practices associated with the onset of puberty. Grade 5: Identify the parts of the reproductive system. Describe the processes of menstruation and spermatogenesis. Describe stresses related to puberty and identify strategies to manage them. Explain how a person's actions, either in person or online, can affect people's feelings and reputation, including making sexual comments and sharing sexual pictures. Grade 6: Identify factors that affect a person's 'self-concept,' for example stereotypes, gender identity and body image. Describe how to lay a foundation for healthy relationships by understanding changes that occur during adolescence . Grade 7: Explain the importance of understanding with a partner about delaying sexual activity and the concept of consent. Identify common sexually transmitted infections and describe their symptoms. Identify ways of preventing STIs and unintended pregnancy. Grade 8: Identify and explain factors that can affect decisions about sexual activity. Demonstrate an understanding of gender identity and sexual orientation. Demonstrate an understanding of contraception and the concept of consent. Grade 9: Demonstrate an understanding of the benefits and risks of using communication technologies. Describe the relative effectiveness of methods to prevent unintended pregnancy or STIs. Demonstrate an understanding of factors influencing a person's gender identity and sexual orientation. Grade 10: Describe factors that influence sexual decision making. Describe some common misconceptions about sexuality in our culture, and explain how these may harm people. Explain how being in an exclusive relationship with another person affects them and their relations with others. Grade 11: Demonstrate an understanding of a variety of mental illnesses and addictions. Describe how proactive health measures and supports, for example breast and testicular examinations, can be applied to avoid or minimize illness. Grade 12: Demonstrate an understanding of the effects and legal implications of different types of harassment, violence, and abuse in different relationships and settings and describe ways of responding to and preventing them. Demonstrate an understanding of how relationships develop and how to maintain a healthy relationship. Source: Ontario Ministry of Education .

"The husband of actress Emma Thompson has said he and his wife will not pay a penny of tax until those involved in the HSBC scandal are sent to jail. Actor Greg Wise said he and his Oscar-winning wife Thompson were 'disgusted' with the HMRC and HSBC after the tax row. He warned the couple were even willing to go to prison in their moral stand after the allegations earlier this month that HSBC's Geneva branch had helped its wealthy customers  dodge taxes. Actor Greg Wise, pictured with Oscar-winning wife Emma Thompson, said he was 'disgusted' with the HMRC and HSBC after the tax row . 'I want to stop paying tax, until everyone pays tax,' Wise told the Evening Standard. The 'profound' socialist, who met Thompson on the set of Sense and Sensibility in 1994 when she was splitting up with Kenneth Branagh, claimed they loved paying tax but refused to pay any more until the row was resolved. 'I am disgusted with HMRC. I am disgusted with HSBC. And I'm not paying a penny more until those evil b******* go to prison,' he added. 'Em's on board. We're going to get a load of us together.  They can't send everyone to prison. But we'll go to prison if necessary.' Allegations had emerged earlier this month that HSBC's Geneva branch (pictured) had helped its wealthy customers dodge taxes . Mr Wise, pictured with British actress Emma Thompson, daughter Gaia and adopted son Tindyebwa Agaba, warned he and his wife were even willing to go to prison over their stand on HSBC . Although he claimed yesterday to live in a ‘poor bit’ of West Hampstead, Mr Wise and Miss Thompson in fact live on one of the most expensive roads in the upmarket North West London district. Average house prices in the street, where Miss Thompson was born, are more than £2million – meaning that the Labour-supporting luvvies, who sent their daughter to private school, will also be expected to pay a mansion tax if Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister. Their peaceful tree-lined street, a 15-minute walk from Hampstead Heath, is home to Miss Thompson’s mother, the actress Phyllida Law, as well as Downton Abbey star Jim Carter. Other actors, television personalities, politicians and public figures living nearby include Stephen Fry and Bank of England governor Mark Carney. The HSBC row came to light after an investigation by journalists claimed that its Swiss arm had helped wealthy clients such as sports stars, celebrities and politicians evade huge amounts of tax. A trove of documents were leaked relating to accounts worth $100 billion held by more than 100,000 people and legal entities around the world. Details of thousands of UK-based clients of the branch were handed to authorities in 2007 by a whistleblower. But the reports did not reach Britain until 2010 after a deal between HMRC and the French authorities. Officials say part of the deal was that the taxman could not pass on the details – but they have since been leaked. Since then only one person has been prosecuted despite £135million being recovered. HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver has since admitted to the bank's shame over its Swiss tax scandal today as it disclosed profits slumped by 17 per cent last year. But Wise, 48, was furious that HSBC had not been given even a slap on the wrist because, he claimed, the row fell into the grey area between avoidance and evasion.","Emma Thompson's husband Greg Wise was 'disgusted' over HSBC row .

"A college student has been charged with sexually assaulting 19-year-old woman after he allegedly attempted to recreate Fifty Shades of Grey. Mohammad Hossain, 19, is accused of tying up his victim, a fellow student, whipping and punching her before raping her in his dormitory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The engineering student has admitted to police that he assaulted the woman, but explained to them that it was because they were 're-enacting scenes from Fifty Shades of Grey'. Charged: Mohammad Hossain, 19, is accused of tying up a fellow student, also 19, whipping and punching her before raping her in his dormitory at the University of Illinois at Chicago . Mr Hossain, a college freshman and student ambassador to the alumni association, and the alleged victim went to his room on Saturday afternoon. Hossain is said to have asked her to remove her clothing, which she consented to but kept her bra and underwear on, before tying her hands and legs with belts, the Chicago Tribune reports. He used a necktie to cover her mouth and pulled a knit cap over her eyes, before removing her underwear, Assistant State's Attorney Sarah Karr told the Cook County court. Mr Hossain then struck her several times with a belt before she told him to stop as he was hurting her, the court heard. The woman 'began shaking her head and crying', but Mr Hossain is said to have continued to hit her with the belt and also punched her several times. Copy cat: The engineering student allegedly admitted to university police that he assaulted the woman, but explained to them that it was because they were 're-enacting scenes from Fifty Shades of Grey' Assault: The victim, also a University of Illinois at Chicago student, said Mr Hossain continued to whip and punch her with his fists after she began crying and telling him to stop, before proceeding to rape her . Despite the victim crying and continuing to beg him to stop, Mr Hossein held her arms behind her back and sexually assaulted her, an arrest warrant claims. The woman left Mr Hossain's dorm after the alleged assault and reported the incident to the police. Mr Hossain was arrested by campus police, and after admitting to 'doing something wrong' and assaulting the woman, he told officers they had been 're-enacting scenes from Fifty Shades of Grey', Ms Karr said according to the newspaper. Mr Hossain remains in custody on a $500,000 bail. His lawyer claims he thought the sex was consensual. The hit film Fifty Shades of Grey is an adaptation of the adaptation of the best-selling novel by British author E.L. James. The film, which stars James Dornan as BDSM-loving billionaire Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson as innocent college student Anastasia 'Ana' Steele, spent a second weekend at the top of the U.S. and Canadian box office charts. Fifty Shades, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, has already racked up $410 million in global sales in less than two weeks, according to Universal Pictures.","Mohammad Hossain, 19, is accused of assaulting a fellow student .

"Rachel Reeves: Labour frontbencher is set for a Cabinet role if Ed Miliband wins the election in May . David Cameron yesterday distanced himself from remarks by a Conservative MP who questioned a Labour frontbencher's plan to go on maternity leave straight after the election. Rachel Reeves hopes to become Work and Pensions Secretary if Ed Miliband wins power in May, but is due to have her second baby just five weeks later. She said at the weekend that she would begin maternity leave shortly before her baby is due and stay away from work until September. That prompted Tory MP for Romford Andrew Rosindell to say: 'I don't want to say someone who is having a baby is not eligible to be a Cabinet minister, but I certainly think perhaps the demands of that particular job will require someone to give it their full attention. 'I don't expect Rachel Reeves to be in the Cabinet after the election because I expect the Conservatives to win, but clearly people need to be put in the positions they can handle.' Yesterday, however, when asked whether the Prime Minister believed a pregnant woman could serve in the Cabinet, Mr Cameron's official spokesman replied: 'Why on Earth not?' He added: 'The Prime Minister's views around maternity leave (entitlements) is that they are universal, they apply to everyone and it is entirely a matter for individual families to take the decisions that they think are right for them, and the Government's job is to support them in those decisions they take.' Despite Mr Cameron's support, Miss Reeves last night accused the Conservatives of having a 'women problem'. She wrote on Twitter: '300,000 women a year take maternity leave but @AndrewRosindell thinks can't do big job & be a mum. Tory women problem?' The election Miss Reeves, 36, hopes will propel her into the Cabinet is on May 7, and she is due to have her second child on June 15. She has said she believes she will have time before she goes on maternity leave to abolish the so-called bedroom tax – the reduction of benefits for claimants in social housing who are deemed to have more living space than they require, which ministers refer to as ending a 'spare room subsidy'. Miss Reeves said: 'I'm having a child and I shall be on maternity leave for the early weeks and months of the next government. Miss Reeves took to Twitter to hit back at criticism of the idea of taking maternity leave from the Cabinet . 'The first thing I would do is abolish the bedroom tax. That's something I can do really quickly. My baby's due in June and I want to cancel the bedroom tax before I go on maternity leave.' Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem minister for employment relations, yesterday joined the criticism of Mr Rosindell. She said: 'The suggestion that a woman should be turned down for a job because she is pregnant is clearly outrageous. 'That kind of discrimination would be illegal under employment law and is an appalling attack on the right of pregnant women to take on high-profile leadership roles in government or business. It echoes the outdated sexist view that women can't be good mothers and also good at their jobs.' David Cameron (left) distanced himself from remarks by Tory MP Andrew Rosindell who questioned whether Miss Reeves could give the job her full attention . Mr Rosindell was last night unavailable for comment. Miss Reeves, who is married to civil servant Nick Joicey, does not have a nanny or any formal childcare and relies mainly on her mother and aunt. She took five months' maternity leave from Parliament after her first child was born in March 2013. During the election campaign she is expected to be one of Labour's most prominent public faces with regular TV appearances. She has been pushed forward by Ed Miliband, becoming shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011 before being promoted to shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013. But she insisted last night that she does not want to become Labour leader, telling LBC radio: 'I see the sacrifices my leader Ed Miliband makes and the toll I think it must place on family life. It's not something that I want to do.'","Rachel Reeves hopes to be Work and Pensions Secretary if Labour wins .

"A fisherman has caught a giant 8ft 9in long catfish weighing 19 stone - and it could be the biggest ever caught with the humble rod and line. Dino Ferrari hooked the huge wels catfish, which was 2.67m in length, last week in the Po Delta in Italy. The cannibalistic wels catfish, also known as the sheatfish, is native to Europe and can grow as long as 13ft and up to 62st - but it is exceedingly rare to catch one that is over two metres long. Scroll down for video. Dino Ferrari hooked the huge wels catfish, which was 2.67m in length, last week in the Po Delta in Italy . It is exceedingly rare to catch a catfish over 2m long. The giant fish caught by Dino Ferrari measured 2.67m long and weighed 19 stone . Mr Ferrari poses with his remarkable catch in the waters of the Po Delta, Italy . While Mr Ferrari's fish might set a new record for the biggest ever caught on a line, it is not the heaviest ever hooked . But while Mr Ferrari's fish might set a new record for the biggest ever caught on a line, it is not the heaviest ever hooked - that award goes to catfish which weighed 22st and was 9ft long, and was caught in the Po Delta, reports The Mirror. In December schoolboy Sam Lee, 14, caught an 8ft 14 stone catfish while on a fishing holiday in Spain with his father Peter. The giant catfish immediately bolted 100 metres downstream, but Sam, from Chester, hung on and after a 35 minute battle finally landed the 2.5 metre-long fish. In time honoured tradition, he then posed for a photo to secure bragging rights before letting the creature swim back into the water at the River Ebro in Catalonia. Mr Ferrari (pictured) poses with his monster catch. Wels catfish can grow as long as 13ft and weigh up to 62st . The wels catfish can live for thirty years and live off annelid worms, gastropods, insects, crustaceans and fish . Mr Ferrari took this photo after hauling in his catch, showing it to measure 2.67m in length . In October a Cornish pensioner caught an 8ft-long, 15 stonepart-albino catfish, thought to be the biggest of its kind ever caught. The aptly named Tom Herron, 68, from Launceston, battled the cream-coloured monster fish in the River Segre, Mequinenza, Spain, for 40 minutes before finally hauling it in. The wels catfish is scaleless and lives in fresh and brackish water. It is recognisable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth. The wels catfish can live for thirty years and live off annelid worms, gastropods, insects, crustaceans and fish including other catfish; the larger ones also eat frogs, mice, rats, and even ducks. Recently, wels catfish have been spotted in non-native habitats lunging out of the water to grab pigeons on land.","Fisherman caught an 8ft 9in long catfish weighing 19 stone in Italy .

"Alcohol isn’t the only substance that could get you in trouble behind the wheel — your medication could put you over the limit, too. A Department for Transport study found drug driving (due to legal or illegal drugs) was responsible for up to 200 fatal accidents every year. From next month, new legislation will set limits for certain prescription medicines, such as the painkiller morphine, and drugs for anxiety or insomnia, such as diazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam and temazepam. Experts warn that many motorists are not aware that seemingly innocent over-the-counter drugs such as hay fever remedies can also have an effect on driving and get you into trouble with the law . It’s already illegal to drive if your reactions are impaired by medication — the new law is designed to bring drug driving into line with drink driving, with clear limits on prescription medications. Experts warn that many motorists are not aware that seemingly innocent over-the-counter drugs such as hay fever remedies can also have an effect on driving and get you into trouble with the law. ‘Many forms of medication make it clear on the label that when taken they can impair your ability to drive,’ says solicitor Paul Reddy, of firm Slater & Gordon. ‘Just because they are legal and widely available, if taking them affects your driving you could end up with points, a fine, disqualification from driving or even worse if you have an accident.’ Here, we examine the common medicines — over-the-counter and prescription — which could have an influence on you behind the wheel . . . BLOOD PRESSURE . Drugs such as the ACE inhibitor ramipril can make you feel dizzy. As blood pressure drops, the brain may receive less blood, causing light-headedness. ‘If it happens, it’s likely to be within a couple of hours of taking the drug, so avoid driving then,’ says Dr Nigel Durham, a consultant cardiologist at York Hospital. Take these drugs at night to be extra careful, and if the problem persists, see your GP. UPSET TUMMY . Over-the-counter medicines to treat diarrhoea may cause drowsiness as a side-effect. This is linked to the ingredient loperamide — found in products such as Imodium — which slows down the digestive process. HAY FEVER . Some hay fever treatments can make you feel drowsy, though this is less common with newer types of antihistamines. ‘Anti-allergy drugs are divided into sedating and non-sedating medication,’ says Dr Jude Gunasekera, a Manchester GP. Some hay fever treatments can make you feel drowsy, though this is less common with newer types of antihistamines . ‘If you’re taking a sedating medication, allow at least two to three hours before driving.’ Otherwise, use treatments that work on symptoms locally, such as eye drops. COLDS AND FLU . Nearly one in seven motorists who has taken cold or flu medication containing codeine has suffered side-effects, such as lethargy, behind the wheel, according to a 2014 survey by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. Codeine, a painkiller, can slow reaction times and has been linked to low concentration levels and blurry eyesight. Remedies such as Night Nurse contain antihistamine, which can cause drowsiness, says Professor Ron Eccles, director of Cardiff University’s Common Cold Centre. ‘I wouldn’t drive for at least six hours after taking one of these preparations,’ he says. NERVE PAIN . The anti-depressant amitriptyline is routinely prescribed for chronic pain, such as severe arthritis or a trapped nerve. However, the drug can affect nerve receptors in the eye, causing blurred vision, so should be taken before you go to bed, says Dr Gunasekera. INDIGESTION . Antacids containing magnesium can cause severe diarrhoea (understandably, this can make driving difficult) if you exceed the recommended dose — easy to do when it’s in liquid form, says Dr Anton Emmanuel, consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital, London. INSOMNIA . Sleeping pills — including over-the-counter remedies such as Nytol, whose main ingredient is an antihistamine — can have a hangover effect the next day, as it can take this long for the liver to expel the drugs from the body. Elderly people are particularly sensitive, so may feel sedated for longer. Sleeping pills can have a hangover effect the next day, as it can take this long for the liver to expel the drugs from the body . ‘They also prevent you going into a deep, “slow-wave” sleep during the night, so you may not feel refreshed in the morning,’ says Russell Foster, professor of circadian neuroscience at Oxford University. ‘Avoid sleeping pills if you have a long drive the following day.’ DEPRESSION . Taking antidepressants may make you more prone to accidents as the chemical changes in the brain that improve mood may also slow reaction times. In 2012, research at the University of Taiwan found those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a group of antidepressants including Prozac and Seroxat, were 72 per cent more at risk than people who were not on medication. HEADACHES . Triptans, taken for migraine, work by acting on the blood vessels to block the pain-triggering action of nerves. But they can leave you feeling tired, says Dr Andrew Dowson, director of headache services at King’s College Hospital, London. ‘It’s unclear whether it’s the drug or the fact it takes away the headache pain associated with migraine, so other symptoms, such as feeling spaced out, appear more acute.’ THE PAINKILLER DANGER ZONE . Strong prescription painkillers such as tramadol — for conditions including chronic lower back pain — can make you drowsy, says Dr Aditi Ghei, consultant anaesthetist at Watford General Hospital. Tramadol mimics endorphins — naturally pain-reducing chemicals in the brain. ‘It’s possible to build up a tolerance, so you may need more for it to take effect, which could have a greater impact on driving,’ says Dr Ghei. ‘If you’ve just been prescribed tramadol, don’t drive for two to three days at any dosage, so you can check its effects on you.’","New legislation next month will set limits for certain prescription medicines .

Louis Thomas Cope and Katrina Marie Norman, were detained by police after officers found an infant inside a minivan with the driver and passenger door completely open in temperatures below freezing. Police were initially called to the house in Gwinett County, Georgia after a complaint regarding animals at the property. Katrina Marie Norman, left, and Louis Thomas Cope, who have been accused of leaving a baby outside in a freezing car while they had sex inside their feces-filled home . When officers arrived at the home in Snellville , they found the baby in the vehicle and when they knocked on the door, Norman 32, answered after several minutes wearing a pink lace suit and a blanket. According to a police report obtained by the Gwinett Daily Post, the responding officer wrote: 'Based on their appearance it has appeared they had left the child in the vehicle while having intercourse.' Cope, 23, reportedly told police that he and Norman had just returned from food shopping when Norman surprised him with pink lingerie. The couple insist that the child wasn't left unsupervised for more than a few minutes, but authorities say they had been on the scene nearly 15 minutes before the pair emerged. The report also added that once police entered the house, there was a strong smell of urine and feces and there was trash thrown about the floor with animal feces in children's bedrooms. Officers from Gwinett County Police, pictured, were called to the house after a complaint regarding animals at the home . The report by the officer also added: 'I saw a knife lying on the ground within reach for a child to grab and hurt themselves.' Police also described the baby and the other two children living at the house as deprived. The pair have now been charged with maintaining a disorderly house and second-degree cruelty to children, which is a felony. Both have since been released after posting $16,900 bonds. Online booking sheets at Gwinett County jail also revealed the tattoos adorning both suspect's bodies with Cope's arm saying 'Family forever' and Norman's back saying 'Partners in crime.'","Police were called to a home in Georgia after receiving an animal complaint .

"Healthy gay men should be given anti-viral drugs to 'slash the number of cases of HIV', a groundbreaking new study has suggested. The Proud study, conducted in England, provides the first evidence that preventative HIV treatment is highly effective in a real-world setting. It showed that pre-exposure to the HIV drug Truvada can reduce the risk of infection in men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) by as much as 86 per cent. Previous research had suggested that preventive treatment might cut HIV infection rates but it was unclear whether such an approach would work in practice. A new study, hailed a 'game-changer' by experts, has found pre-exposure to HIV drugs in healthy gay men can reduce the risk of infection by as much as 86 per cent (file image posed by models) The new study recruited 545 participants at 13 sexual health clinics in England. They were divided into two groups, one of which was to be given Truvada immediately and the other a year later. Comparing the two made it possible to assess the effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in men at high risk of HIV infection. Of the 276 men treated straight away, just three were infected with HIV over the subsequent year. During the same period, 19 of the men from the 'deferred group' became HIV positive. Chief investigator professor Sheena McCormack, from the Medical Research Council's Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, said: 'These results are extremely exciting and show PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV infection in the real world. 'Concerns that PrEP would not work so well in the real world were unfounded. 'These results show there is a need for PrEP, and offer hope of reversing the epidemic among men who have sex with men in this country. 'The findings we've presented today are going to be invaluable in informing discussions about making PrEP available through the NHS.' Dr Michael Brady, medical director at the HIV/Aids charity Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'PrEP is, quite simply, a game-changer. 'We know that most gay men use condoms most of the time, and that this has prevented tens of thousands of HIV infections since the epidemic began in the UK. 'However, we also know that condomless sex vastly increases the risk of HIV being transmitted. 'This research shows just how effective PrEP can be in preventing transmission of the virus in groups at greatest risk; offering another line of defence alongside condoms and regular testing. 'It is not a vaccine and it won't be for everyone, but once approved, we expect it to significantly increase the momentum in our fight against the virus. Sexually active gay and bisexual men are at highest risk of HIV infection, pictured under the microscope. In 2013, an estimated 2,800 new HIV infections occurred in  men who have sex with men in the UK . 'We urge the Government, NHS England and local authorities to make PrEP a key priority in the fight against HIV.' The findings, presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in Seattle, US, also showed that taking a drug to protect against HIV did not appear to alter rates of condom use. No significant impact was seen on levels of infection of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). An aggressive new strain of HIV has been identified, scientists have warned. A new study found the strain, called CRF19, is capable of transforming from an infection to full-blown aids within just three years. That is considerably faster than the average conversion time of around 10 years - and can be so quick that a person may not even realise they are infected. Scientists were prompted to investigate after noting a growing number of reports of people in Cuba suffering a rapid progression to AIDS, within three years of infection. HIV tests often do not detect the virus within the first few weeks of infection, sometimes months. Once a person develops the flu-like symptoms that characterise acute infection - usually coming two to four weeks after infection - the virus undergoes a latency period. During that time the virus replicates and lives inside the body, but does not cause any symptoms. That period can last between five and 10 years before AIDS develops, in most cases. But researchers at the University of Leuven in Belgium noted the CRF19 strain causes patients to make the transition to AIDS much faster. It can be so quick that a person may not even realise they are infected. Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: 'The study shows two important things - one, that PrEP is highly effective in preventing HIV. 'And two, that gay men won't just throw away the condoms as soon as they start taking PrEP (STIs were the same in men taking and not taking PrEP). 'During the study period there were 19 HIV infections in the group not taking PrEP. 'If we can stop people getting HIV by giving them PrEP, we have an ethical duty to do so. 'Furthermore, over the course of their lifetime the treatment of those 19 men will cost the NHS nearly £7 million. 'So the financial argument is clear, as is the ethical one. PrEP needs to be available on the NHS as soon as possible for all those who need it.' Proud stands for PRe-exposure Option for reducing HIV in the UK: immediate or Deferred. In October last year, an ethical decision was taken to offer men in the 'deferred group' arm of the study Truvada earlier than planned. This followed an interim analysis of the data that revealed the extent of the protection provided by prophylactic treatment. Sexually active gay and bisexual men are the population group at highest risk of HIV infection. In 2013, an estimated 2,800 new HIV infections occurred in MSM in the UK. Dr Des Walsh, head of infections and immunity at the Medical Research Council, which co-funded the study, said: 'HIV remains a serious public health concern - in 2013 alone, around 2,800 gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men became infected. 'So clearly, additional approaches are needed to tackle the HIV epidemic, particularly for populations at higher risk. 'The Proud study addresses this very important issue and shows promising results that a relatively straightforward intervention based on existing therapy - PrEP - could have a major impact in preventing HIV infection.'","Pre-exposure to the drug Truvada reduce risk of HIV infection in men who have sex with men by as much as 86 per cent, English study found .

"Brooklyn Beckham has been left disappointed in his attempts to secure an Arsenal scholarship. The 15-year-old is enrolled at the club's Hale End academy and was hoping to be handed a two-year term to continue with the Gunners.

However, Sportsmail can reveal that Beckham was one of only a few Under 16 and Under 17 players still at the club's Hale End academy that weekend as the rest travelled to the Al Kass youth tournament in Qatar. And many at the club's Hale End academy saw his promotion as more of a case of default rather than merit. Beckham will remain at the club, however, until the end of the season.

"Spanish investigators have smashed an alleged online terror network accused of recruiting young women to join Islamic State militants fighting in Iraq and Syria. Two  suspects were arrested in Melilla, the Spanish enclave neighbouring Morocco, in the latest operation by Spain's authorities targeting such recruiting networks. Another two were detained in Girona and Barcelona in Spain's northeast. The arrests came as European nations scramble to halt a surge in young people wanting to travelling to Iraq and Syria to fight with the jihadists. Suspect: One of the two suspects were arrested in Melilla, the Spanish enclave neighbouring Morocco . Another as-yet unidentified man is seen being led away by anti-terror officers following his arrest . Grinning: A third man is seen laughing and smiling as he is arrested at his home in Barcelona today . The two arrested in Melilla were said to be behind the creation and operation of several Internet platforms spreading propaganda, particularly for ISIS, the interior ministry said in a statement. 'In line with the strategy of the Daesh terrorist group, they focused on the recruitment of women who, after a process of indoctrination, would end up joining the terrorist group in conflict zones,' it said, referring to a derogatory Arabic acronym for ISIS. Private home visits were also organised for recruiting purposes and a number of young people had begun preparations to travel to war zones, the ministry said. One of those arrested ran a 'virtual community' with ISIS propaganda and more than 1,000 subscribers, it said. On Facebook, he had a 'multitude of subscribers' outside Spain, including Latin America and countries such as Belgium, France, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Turkey and the United States, the statement said. A man is seen being arrested in Barcelona this morning on suspicion of being involved in the terror network . The father of one of four arrested men stands outside his home in Sant Vicens dels Horts, near Barcelona . The father and brother of one of the arrested men are photographed in their home this morning . One of the suspects arrested in Spain's northeast was described as an Islamic State sympathiser-turned-propagandist. The other was said to have published video to recruit potential jihadists. Authorities were working to establish links between the two in Melilla and those in Spain's northeast. Spain has dismantled several similar networks, particularly in Melilla and its other African enclave, Ceuta. The two enclaves constitute the only land borders between Africa and Europe. Authorities estimate that around 100 Spanish nationals have joined jihadist fighters in Iraq and Syria, a lower number than those from France, Britain and Germany. Britain says some 500 people have travelled from the country to join jihadist groups, while France says about 1,400 residents have either joined the jihadist cause in Syria and Iraq or were planning to do so. France on Monday announced that it had confiscated the passports of six suspected would-be jihadists and would ban another 40 from travelling.","Four men  arrested on suspicion running alleged terror recruitment network .

"Bill Clinton and Sean Penn attended a hotel opening in Haiti on Tuesday during a charity trip to the impoverished country as the Hollywood actor remained silent on the row over his xenophobic Oscars remarks. Penn was criticized after remarks he made about Mexican-born Alejandro Inarritu's 'green card' status as he presented the director's Academy Award on Sunday. Penn declined to speak to reporters in Haiti over the furor. The actor attended the opening of a new 175-room, Marriott Hotel in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince along with the former president in what backers and officials hope will spur further economic development in the impoverished country. Scroll down for video . Silence: Sean Penn stands next to a photograph of a camp for people displaced by the 2010 earthquake that he rebuilt in a different location. He refused to speak to reporters on Tuesday in Haiti following his 'xenophobic' remarks at Sunday's Oscars . Bill Clinton and Sean Penn visit a Cholera treatment Center yet to be opened in Port-au-Prince, Haiti on Tuesday . The ceremony to mark the opening of the hotel was also attended by Haitian President Michel Martelly and Prime Minister Evans Paul. Penn left town the day after Sunday's glitzy ceremony to travel to the earthquake-ravaged Caribbean nation as part of a delegation led by the former U.S. President, who is also the UN Special Envoy for Haiti. The actor was a major player in efforts to rebuild Haiti after the January 2010 earthquake that devastated the country. The actor was subsequently honored for his relief work with the 2012 Peace Summit Award at the 12th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates in Chicago. However a shadow was cast over this week's charity trip by his on-stage remarks on Sunday. As Penn presented the Academy Award for Best Picture, he said of Inarritu: 'Who gave this son of a b**** his green card? Birdman.' Twitter quickly went into meltdown with users denouncing Penn’s ill-judged ‘joke’ as 'insensitive' to the plight of many immigrants in the U.S. and 'racist.' Clinton and Penn share a joke during their charity trip to view new projects in Haiti after a surge of economic development in the earthquake-ravaged country . Clinton, and actor Sean Penn, toured a Lime Nursery in Mirebalais, Haiti on Monday as part of a U.S. envoy to the country . One of the first to call Penn out was filmmaker and immigration activist Jose Antonio Vargas. 'Mexican director = green card joke. Not funny, just plain xenophobic. Wtf, Sean Penn?!' he tweeted. Others, including TV presenter Mario Lopez, pointed out that the comment was made about a Mexican director while no one questioned the immigration status of the countless British and Australian actors in attendance. The term 'green card' refers to a document that confers permanent residency to immigrants in the United States. While the remark about Inarritu's immigration status struck many as an insult, the director insisted it was nothing more than a brutal joke between old friends. 'I found it hilarious,' Inarritu said after the ceremony. 'Sean and I have that kind of brutal (relationship) where only true friendship can survive.' Director Alejandro Inarritu, seated, insisted afterwards that Penn's remark was nothing more than a brutal joke between old friends . TV presenter Mario Lopez was quick to point out that the comment was made about a Mexican while no one questioned the immigration status of the countless British and Australian actors in attendance . One of the first to call out Sean Penn was filmmaker and immigration activist Jose Antonio Vargas . Inarritu directed Penn in his 2003 film, 21 Grams, and the pair remain friends. Penn posed for pictures with Inarritu after the ceremony. The director, who won three Oscars on Sunday night, said he has told many similarly brutal jokes at Penn's expense. 'I make on him a lot of very tough jokes that I will not tell you,' Inarritu said. Joke or not, the remark struck many as problematic for an awards ceremony that had been criticized for not having more nominees of color. Inarritu joked that after his three wins on Sunday, the Academy might institute a residency requirement. 'Maybe next year, the government will inflict some immigration rules (on) the academy. Two Mexicans in a row, that's suspicious, I guess,' the director quipped. His win in the best directing category marks back-to-back wins for Mexican-born directors; last year director Alfonso Cuaron received the Academy Award for Gravity. It took some of the sting out of Penn's words, but Inarritu also used the opportunity to celebrate immigrants. The director called on his fellow Mexicans to build a better government, and said those who have come to the U.S.  should be afforded the respect that previous generations of immigrants have been given. 'I want to dedicate this award for my fellow Mexicans, the ones who live in Mexico,' Inarritu said. 'I pray that we can find and build the government that we deserve. And the ones that live in this country who are part of the latest generation of immigrants in this country, I just pray that they can be treated with the same dignity and the respect of the ones who came before and (built) this incredible immigrant nation.' Penn's ill-judged attempt at humor was considered racially insensitive by a number of people on Twitter . Other people commented that no one would make such a racial-charged 'joke' about the countless Brits and Australians present at the event .","Penn was slammed after joking about Mexican-born Alejandro Inarritu's 'green card' status as he presented the director's Academy Award .

"Olivier Giroud is not available for Arsenal’s Champions League qualifier against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday - because the club failed to register him for the tournament. The France striker scored against Manchester United on Saturday in his first action since breaking his leg against Everton three months ago. The 28-year-old was not expected to be available again until January but has made a surprisingly swift recovery. All clubs had to submit their 25-man squad lists for the Champions League group stages by August 31 and Giroud sustained the injury on August 23.

"Paul Gascoigne has revealed Arsenal  paid £50,000 towards his medical care - and that part of that was arranged by Arsene Wenger. The 47-year-old was spotted for the first time recently following an apparent alcohol binge that led to Gascoigne being sectioned under the Mental Health Act a month ago. The ex-England midfielder has told how Arsenal, a team he never played for and north London rivals of his former club Tottenham Hotspur, helped pay for his treatment.

The footballing legend visited an off-licence in a taxi but only to buy cigarettes as he gets himself on the mend . 'I rang up (Arsenal) physio Gary Lewin and told him I wasn't feeling great,' Gascoigne told The Sun. 'He said to go to hospital as he feared it was pneumonia. Wenger then agreed to arrange £28,000 to pay for treatment. Arsenal also paid £22,000 when I had hip treatment.' But, when Tottenham were facing Real Madrid in 2011 in the Champions League, Gascoigne claims he was told by his former club that he would have to pay to get into White Hart Lane. 'I wanted to watch Spurs against Real Madrid and got told they only had two tickets for £60,' he continues. 'I'd have to watch from under the directors' box with some players who played 30 years before me.' Gascoigne spent almost a week in hospital after being sectioned under the Mental Health Act in October, and says he was doing '800 press-ups, 800 sit-ups and 800 squats per day' to stay fit.

"Thousands of people gathered  today to witness the brutal execution of two pigs which were chopped in half so villagers could dip their money in the blood as part of a good luck ceremony. Each year residents of Nem Thuong village in Bac Ninh province, Vietnam, hack two pigs in half with ceremonial machetes in a ritual they believe will bring them good luck and fortune in the coming year. But many people in the country, where animal rights are a newly emerging concept, are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the annual 'pig slaughtering' festival. Each year residents of Nem Thuong village in Bac Ninh province, Vietnam, hack two pigs in half with ceremonial machetes in a ritual they believe will bring them good luck and fortune for the coming year . One of the sacrificial pigs is carried into the ceremony as villagers take photographs on their phones . During the bloody ritual the pigs are held down with ropes and sliced in half across the belly with swords as part of Lunar New Year celebrations. Vietnam's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism had called on villagers to tone down the more bloody aspects of the ritual sacrifice. Local officials in Bac Ninh province also urged villagers to change it to a 'pig-parading festival' following criticism from animal rights groups and local media. Those pleas fell on deaf ears today as two pigs were paraded around the village to the sound of beating drums and horns before being tied down and hacked in half with machetes to cheers from the crowd. The popular event is increasingly coming under fire from the growing animal rights movement in Vietnam . A man dressed in ceremonial clothing carries one of the machetes he will use to hack the pigs in half . Men in ceremonial robes prepare one of the pigs for sacrifice during today's pig slaughtering ceremony . Nguyen Dinh Loi, from Nem Thuong's old people's association, said: 'The older generations here say it is the village's choice, that the pig slaughtering does not violate the law and must be decided by the villagers themselves. 'We want to keep the traditions of our ancestors.' After the animals were slaughtered, villagers dipped bank notes into pools of blood in the belief that doing so will ensure good luck and fortune for the new year. Animals Asia Foundation, which campaigns against the tradition and other animal cruelty issues, says this year's festival was preceded by increasingly disapproving commentary in Vietnam's tightly controlled media and on social networks. 'We are seeing a broad condemnation of cruelty from Vietnam's people and increasingly from politicians too,' Tuan Bendixsen, the group's Vietnam director, said. Thousands of people attended the event despite growing criticism of such bloody rituals in Vietnam . The pig is sacrificed in the village (left).

"A photographer managed to capture a tender moment between two cold-blooded amphibians on film as one frog appeared put a protective arm around the other. The amorous pair of flying frogs were balanced on a branch in a pond and gazing into the distance when photographer Hendy Mp took the picture in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. The 25-year-old photographer came across the 'very happy' frogs in his friend's back garden at the end of last month and was delighted when they seemed to hug each other.

"You will have to fork out a few beans if you fancy this chocolate as it is said to be the world's most expensive bar. To'ak chocolate, which translated to 'earth' and 'tree' in ancient Ecuadorian dialects, costs a whopping $260 (£169) per bar. Despite its hefty price tag the handmade treat is surprisingly light, in fact it is so delicate that each bar weighs just 1.5 ounces. The To'ak chocolate bar is said to be the world's most expensive pure chocolate bar costing £169 . It is eaten using wooden tongs, or tasting utensils, so that it is easier to perceive the chocolate's aroma on the nose. The creators of the snack say that one of the reasons for To'ak's price tag is that 95 per cent of chocolate is made using mass-produced beans, whereas their chocolate comes from the remaining five per cent, known as fine grade cacao. Each step towards making the bar - which is 81 per cent cacao mass and the rest sugar - is meticulous, requiring 36 steps to make the bar. The chocolate bar is presented in a wooden gift box complete Arriba Appelation map and wooden tongs that are used to eat the treat to best enhance the chocolate's aroma . Producers of the bar say it's high price is due to its 85 per cent grade cacao as opposed to ordinary chocolate that only contains fiver per cent . Rare cacao seeds are first harvested from the coast of Ecuador, before they are fermented and turned into liquid chocolate. This liquid chocolate is then hand-moulded and a single, hand-selected, hand-measured and shelled cacao bean is placed in the centre - this must fit perfectly and measure between 7mm and 8mm. Though there are other chocolates out there with higher price tags, To'ak claim their chocolate is the most expensive pure chocolate - with no expensive additions.

Jerry Toth, co-founder of To'ak, says that their approach to chocolate is similar to that of other luxury food products with high price tags. 'We make chocolate with the same care and precision as we know it from fine wine and premium small batch whiskey.' Carl Schweizer, co-founder of To'ak, added: 'It is the most expensive pure dark chocolate in the world without any fancy stuff like gold leaves or diamonds in it to increase its value. 'We produce our chocolate in the country of origin and focus a single origin that sums only 14 small farmers. 'Being so small permits us to be 100% involved in absolutely every step of making chocolate: from earth to tree to bean to bar.'

"Death row: Kelly Renee Gissendaner (above), 47,  is scheduled to be executed at 7pm on Wednesday . A woman who is will become Georgia's first female inmate to be executed in 70 years when she is given the lethal injection tomorrow is making a final plea for her life this morning. Kelly Renee Gissendaner, the only woman on death row in the state, is scheduled to die at 7pm on Wednesday at a Jackson prison for the 1997 death of her husband in suburban Atlanta. The 47-year-old has exhausted all appeals to higher courts but on Tuesday morning, she will ask the parole board - the sole authority who can commute a death sentence - for clemency. 'The Board will either grant clemency, commuting to life with or without parole possibility, deny clemency, or issue a stay not to exceed 90 days,' board spokesman Steven Hayes told the Athens-Banner Herald on Monday. The board will meet in private at 9am. They could reach a decision on Tuesday but the only guideline is that they must decide the outcome before her scheduled execution time. Gissendaner was convicted of killing her husband, Douglas, in February 1997 along with her then-boyfriend Gregory Owen. Authorities said she had wanted to kill her husband - whom she had previously divorced and then re-married - because she wanted to split from him again but thought he would not leave her alone. Together, the duo plotted the murder for months and Owen followed her orders to kill Douglas while she was out at a nightclub with friends on February 7, 1997, CNN reported. Owen waited at the couple's home until Douglas arrived before kidnapping him and driving him to a remote area. He stole his watch and wallet to make the murder look like a robbery. Arrest: Gissendaner, who is Georgia's only female death row inmate, was arrested in 1997 for plotting to kill her husband with her then-boyfriend, Gregory Owen (right), who ultimately testified against her . Victim: Douglas Gissendaner was stabbed multiple times in the neck by Owen in February 1997 after his wife wanted to divorce him but thought he would not leave her alone. His body was found two weeks later . He then beat Douglas across the head with a nightstick and stabbed him in the neck and back between eight and 10 times. Kelly Gissendaner arrived as the murder took place but remained in her car. She later got out to make sure that her husband was dead before the pair took Douglas' vehicle and burned it using kerosene. The duo then left the scene. Douglas' burned-out car was found the following morning, and more than a week later the body was found a mile away. Animals had eaten away at the skin on Douglas' neck, making it hard for authorities to deduce which stab wound had killed him, CNN reported. In the days before he was found, Kelly Gissendaner had appeared on local TV to appeal for help finding her husband - but on February 24, Owen confessed to the murder and implicated her. While in jail, she plotted to pay someone $10,000 to falsely claim that they had driven her to the murder scene at gunpoint, but her cellmate alerted authorities to the plan. Owen is serving life in prison in Washington state for his role in the murder. He avoided the death penalty after testifying against his former lover. In court: Gissendaner was found guilty of plotting the murder in 1998 (pictured) and sentenced to death . Locked up: Gissendaner, who will be the first woman to be executed in Georgia in 70 years, is seen eating a meal in her cell at Metro State Prison in Atlanta in 2004. She has requested a 2,400-calorie final meal . She was sentenced to death in November 1998 after she was found guilty of her part in the death. Gissendaner, who is incarcerated at Arrendale State Prison, is the only woman among 84 inmates facing the death penalty in Georgia, according to a report by the state's Department of Corrections. She is set to be only the 14th woman executed in Georgia since 1735, according to the AJC. The last time a woman was executed was in 1945. Lena Baker was electrocuted in March of that year after she was convicted of murder for shooting her boss. In 2005, the state pardoned her after agreeing with her family that she acted in self defense. Gissendaner has requested a last meal of cornbread with a side of buttermilk; two Burger King Whoppers with cheese; two large orders of fries; cherry vanilla ice cream; popcorn; a salad with boiled eggs, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cheese and Newman's Own buttermilk dressing; and lemonade, according to CBS46. A rough estimate shows that the food contains more than 4,200 calories. Under Georgia law, only three offenses are punishable by death - murder, rape and kidnapping.","Kelly Gissendaner will be put to death by lethal injection in Jackson, Georgia at 7pm Wednesday for the 1997 murder of her husband .

"The makers of Immigration Street have been accused of hindering a police probe over alleged crimes which took place during filming of the controversial documentary. The Channel 4 show, created by the team behind Benefits Street, focused on Derby Road, a street in a deprived area of Southampton where just 17 per cent are considered white British. The programme, which aired last night, divided opinion on the street, with those who had agreed to take part reportedly being threatened by those against the production. Scroll down for video . Andy, a resident of Derby Road in Southampton features in the Channel 4 documentary Immigration Street . Cleaner Delroy Campbell, the outspoken Jamaican who was happy to contribute, was threatened and intimidated by fellow residents who were not impressed that he was cooperating with the production . The furore around the filming even led to film crew being subjected to verbal threats from locals and being pelted with stones - a scene which featured in the documentary. But police claim that programme makers have failed to assist their investigations into the incidents, by refusing to provide statements about the allegations. Superintendent James Fulton, Southampton's police commander, told The Daily Telegraph: 'We did receive reports of a number of confrontations between local groups and film crew. 'However, Channel 4 has declined to provide any statements which would provide us with the evidence necessary to make follow-up inquiries against suspects, so we have been unable to take these allegations any further.' Love Productions said it believed an official complaint against individuals would 'make life more difficult for contributors'. It added that police were belatedly permitted to watch the show just before it began on Channel 4. The broadcast of the hour-long programme came after ten months of fierce campaigning by residents who have made repeated attempts to force producers to axe the show. The strength of feeling led to one man being allegedly beaten up after standing up for a local resident who chose to participate in the film. The furore around the filming, which prompted a protest meeting (pictured), led to film crew being subjected to verbals threats from locals and being pelted with stones - a scene which featured in the documentary . The broadcast of the hour-long programme came after ten months of fierce campaigning by residents who have made repeated attempts to force producers to axe the show . Separately, local gang members threatened to shoot production staff, demanded £200,000 protection money and allegedly slashed tyres on a crew member's vehicle, it was reported. A scene on last night's programme showed a masked youth shouting at camera crew: 'Get out of this f*****g area. Next time, gunshot', while pelting them with grit. There was also footage of the  production crew discussing the threats they had received and making calls to locals who they believed would be at risk. After the attack, security consultants told producers that filming should be cut short, amid fears for their safety. The broadcaster's initial plan had been to have an entire series filmed on the street, but that was scaled back following the confrontation. There had also been a public meeting organised by disgruntled locals during which the show's producer Kieran Smith was shouted down. Security consultants told producers that an attack and threats was so serious that filming was cut short . He said afterwards: 'Many people on Derby Road made the crew feel welcome and wanted to share their stories but there were local groups who, for their own reasons, were determined to halt production. 'It's a great shame as the footage we have shot shows Derby Road is a place where, on the whole, people of different nationalities, cultures and religions respect and get along with each other. This will be reflected in the film.' And Channel 4 said: 'On the street itself, verbal aggression was turning into threats of violence. Finally the producers reluctantly took the decision to pull out, as the safety of the crew could no longer be guaranteed.' Earlier this week, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady has added her voice to calls for Channel 4 to cancel the documentary. She followed in the footsteps of local MP Alan Whitehead, who urged makers to reconsider scheduling the programme. Ms O'Grady said: 'Channel 4 needs to respect the views of the Southampton community and cancel Immigration Street. 'The show looks set to encourage social division and hostility towards migrants and the black, minority and ethnic community. Instead of such irresponsible broadcasting, the media should expose how communities are suffering from the shocking impact of low wages, lousy contracts and cuts to services.' A Channel 4 had said claims of racism were 'pure fiction'. The Channel 4 show, created by the team behind Benefits Street, focused on Derby Road, a street in a deprived area of Southampton where just 17 per cent are considered white British . They said: 'We understand immigration is a much debated issue which is why Channel 4, as a public service broadcaster has a duty to explore it and not shy away from difficult subject such as this. 'Anyone who does not want to be in the series won't be but we intend to continue to film with residents who are very happy to share their experience of living on Derby Road.' The programme was billed as a follow-on from Channel 4's controversial Benefits Street which aired last year and sparked a nationwide debate about welfare in Britain. The five-part series, which first aired in January 2014, provoked hundreds of complaints to police, broadcast watchdog Ofcom, and Channel 4. Among them were claims it portrayed criminal activities, foul language and misleading portrayals of those on benefits. Some critics labelled it 'poverty porn' and said it painted a false picture of life in modern Britain. Channel 4 was criticised for demonising those living on the breadline, while some of the residents claim they were misled into appearing. Those starring in the series, including single mother White Dee (real name Deirdre Kelly), were also subjected to death threats by Twitter trolls. The show even attracted fierce political debate and was the subject of the Prime Minister's Questions.","Show, which aired last night, focused on Derby Road in Southampton .

"Kellermeister owner Mark Pearce said he made the 'unfortunate' discovery that 25,000 litre of his wine had been drained on Sunday morning . Wine worth more than $300,000 has gone down the drain after a man allegedly snuck into a South Australian winery and opened the taps. About 25,000 litres of wine was released from four tanks at the Kellermeister winery, in Lyndoch, in the early hours of Sunday morning. A 57-year-old Barossa Valley man has been arrested over the incident, and charged with property damage. Kellermeister owner Mark Pearce said he made the 'unfortunate' discovery on Sunday morning. 'We're pretty lucky that the wine that was affected was some of our chardonnay and back vintage wines so all of our higher value wines were unaffected and, you know, are safe and sound,' Mr Pearce told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is what it is. We can't do much about it, it's in the hands of the police now.' Mr Pearce said his winery predominantly produced high-value shiraz-based wines. But he declined to comment on whether he knew the man charged with property damage. The 57-year-old man arrested Tuesday has been bailed to appear in the Elizabeth Magistrates Court on March 31. A spokeswoman for the Barossa Grape and Wine Association said 'it's disappointing that it's happened' but declined to comment further as it is a legal matter.

"Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's campaign strategy, described by one insider to Daily Mail Online as becoming 'everyone's second choice,' is paying dividends early with poll numbers that put him out front nationally among Republicans. A Public Policy Polling survey released Tuesday found Walker is the clear favorite of one in four GOP voters, with both moderates and the tea-party right wing giving him high marks. That 25 per cent showing is well ahead of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose 17 per cent showing is a poor indicator of any public-opinion muscle his gargantuan fundraising advantage might earn him. Even Dr. Ben Carson, an outsider who only brought on a campaign finance chairwoman this week – former Newt Gingrich fundraising coordinator Amy Pass – placed one point ahead of Bush, with 18 per cent support. WHO, ME? WIsconsin Gov. Scott Walker has emerged as an early Republican favorite in the first lap of a very long 2016 race . MONEY CAN'T BUY ME LOVE: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is lagging behind the leader despite a presumed massive fundraising advantage . The numbers tell an early story, with the Republicans' nominating convention still 17 months away in Ohio, but will do wonders for Walker's ability to attract high-dollar donors and earn critical media exposure among a crowded field as the race begins to take shape. In a separate poll published Tuesday, Walker drew into a statistical dead heat for the lead in Texas, where his 19 per cent showing was just one point lower than that of home-state favorite Sen. Ted Cruz. That University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll showed Cruz with a commanding 25 percentage point lead over all other potential 2016 presidential nominees just four months ago. In Tuesday's numbers, Walker atracted support from twice as many Texans as the state's outgoing governor Rick Perry. Cruz was near the bottom of the pile in PPP's national sample, with just 5 per cent support. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who ended his Fox News Channel weekend talk show last month to explore his options, placed behind Walker, Carson and Bush at 10 per cent. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie tied with Cruz at 5 per cent. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul registered 4 per cent support in the PPP poll; Perry and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio came last, tied at 3 per cent. 'Walker is climbing fast in the polling because of his appeal to the most conservative elements of the Republican electorate,' PPP noted. He crushes the field among Republican voters who identify themselves as 'very conservative,' winning support from 37 per cent of them. Next-best among 'very conservative' GOPers is Carson with 19 per cent for Carson, then Bush with 12 per cent and Huckabee with 11. 'There are two times more GOP primary voters who identify as ""very conservative"" than there are ones who identify as moderates,' reports PPP. Some Bush insiders say the former governor aims to raise as much as $100 million by the end of March in a 'shock and awe' financial blitz designed to intimidate his potential opponents. But the poll numbers show he has yet to make serious inroads with the tea party crowd. Just 37 per cent of 'very conservative' Republicans say they have a favorable impression of him, compared with 43 per cent who say they have an 'unfavorable' opinion. Those 'under water' numbers could spell trouble for Bush on the eve of the Conservative Political Action Conference, a three-day event where he has opted for a more laid-back Q&A with Fox News moderator Sean Hannity instead of a more traditional speech. While Bush is seen as an establishment fundraising behemoth, his 37–43 showing indicates a distrust he's earned from right-wing partisans who fear the prospect of pitting a political moderate against HIllary Clinton, the Democrats' all-but-inevitable nominee. By comparison Carson's approve/disapprove numbers among the most conservative GOP voters are 73-2, Walker's are 68-3 and Cruz's are 68-8. 'The party is either going to win with a conservative next year or lose with Mitt Romney 2.0,' one Iowa political consultant told Daily Mail Online. 'The base senses that, and the story of 2016 will be whether all of Jeb's money is enough to buy his way in to the winner's circle.' But a Republican National Committeeman countered that 'Gov. Bush is one of the party's most reliable conservative voices, and ultimately the far-right snake-oil-sellers will shoot themselves in the foot. It's a long campaign, and we need someone steady at the helm.' Neither man agreed to be identified. SURPRISE SHOWING: Retired pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson placed one point ahead of Jeb Bush in the latest national poll of Republican primary voters . IN THE HUNT: Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee had a 10 per cent showing in the Public Policy Polling survey . A Walker insider outlined one of his campaign's strategies a week ago in a conversation with Daily Mail online, predicting that the party would fracture by the end of 2015 ith Bush on one side and tea party stalwarts like Cruz, Perry and Carson on the other. Becoming 'everyone's second choice,' the adviser said, is Walker's most likely path to victory – especially in a contest with more than a dozen credible contenders. 'The tea partiers are goign to love Cruz, and they'll all wish they could elect Carson,' the aide explained. 'The rest of the voters will feel safe with Jeb.' But neither camp is thought to have the ability to overwhelm the field, potentially setting up Walker as a consensus choice next year. The governor is treading carefully in the early going, telling reporters three days ago in Washington that if he forally runs for president, 'I’m not going to go out and attack my opponents.' But Monday night at a convention of Christian broadcasters, he carved out some distance between himself and Bush with a story about his hardscrabble family history. 'I realize that unlike some out there, I didn't inherit fame or fortune from my family,' Walker said. 'I got a bunch of things that were a whole lot better than that.'","Public Policy Polling found the WIsconsin governor is favored by 25 per cent of Republican voters .

Mom first: Ivanka was shot for Vogue in her Manhattan apartment. Her son Joseph, 17 months, makes a cameo in one of the photos . 'I really find that with Judaism, it creates an amazing blueprint for family connectivity . . . 'We observe the Sabbath,' she continues. 'From Friday to Saturday we don't do anything but hang out with one another. We don't make phone calls.' But, Ivanka adds, she has been reluctant to discuss the subject in the past. 'I always shied away from it being a public conversation because it's such a personal thing,' she says. 'We're pretty observant, more than some, less than others. I just feel like it's such an intimate thing for us.' The former model-turned-businesswoman  says her marriage is a far cry from her parents' who divorced in 1992 after 15 years and three children together. Stealing the show!

Indeed, being a hands-on mother is important to her, though she does have the support of a Chinese nanny, XiXi, who is teaching the children to speak Mandarin. 'I would say she is definitely the CEO of our household, whereas I'm more on the board of directors,' says Jared. 'We both pick up slack for each other where it's needed, but she doesn't want to outsource mothering, so she's very involved.' Ivanka jokes that her husband's idea of a date night is a visit to one of his development sites. It's just as well she shares his passion for real estate development. In all seriousness though, the pair seem to have remained besotted with one another, even six years on. 'You realize in life not that many things matter that much, but your choice of spouse is really everything,' Ivanka says. 'I am running a thousand miles a minute, and so is he, but none of it really matters. And I wouldn't be able to do any of it if I didn't have somebody who cared about me and had my best interests in mind. 'If I was married to somebody who, even if beneath the surface, didn't like the fact that I work so hard or didn't support my ambitions for myself or felt self-conscious about my last name . . .

"A DNA match has led New York Police Department cold-case investigators to solve the 22-year-old murder of a young mother, who was strangled and stabbed to death in The Bronx. Police on Friday arrested 46-year-old Johnathan Jolivert in connection to the March 1993 slaying of 21-year-old Michelle Page, who was the mother of his baby son. Page was discovered dead in her apartment in the 1200 block of Morris Avenue on the afternoon of March 24, 1993. Case cracked: Police arrested Johnathan Jolivert, 46 (left), in the 1993 murder of the mother of his young son, 21-year-old Michelle Page, after a DNA sample matched to the suspect . She had a scarf wrapped around her neck and had been stabbed. The woman's naked body was found by her mother lying in a hallway with a kitchen knife protruding from her throat. According to prosecutors, Jolivert visited Page's home on the day of the murder to give her child support money, reported PIX11. The couple's 14-month-old son was not home when Ms Page, a business student at Manhattan Community College, was killed. NYPD's cold-case squad made the arrest after resubmitting for testing a DNA sample found under Michelle Page's fingernails. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has determined that the crime scene evidence matched Johnathan Jolivert's DNA. Jolivert, a homeless man from Brooklyn, was taken into custody without incident at around 6.15pm February 13 at a drug treatment facility in Carmel, New York. He has pleaded not guilty to a second-degree murder charge.

"These dramatic photographs show the moment an out-of-control £40,000 Jaguar smashed into two cars before shunting another car with such force it ploughed through a brick wall. The bizarre incident unfolded in a private members' club car park in Stourbridge, West Midlands, today, when the driver of a silver Jaguar XF apparently lost control of his vehicle. His luxury car, which had a personalised number plate, reportedly clipped a barrier before crashing into a parked car and later into the back of a stationary purple Renault. The driver of a silver Jaguar XF apparently lost control of his vehicle and clipped a barrier and a parked car before striking a stationary purple Renault with such force that is careered through a brick wall (pictured) The unusual incident unfolded in a private members' club car park in Stourbridge, West Midlands, earlier today . The force of the impact sent the Renault through a wall before its front end plunged six foot into the neighbouring Tesco car park. It is thought the owner of the mangled burgundy car was shopping in the town at the time of the incident and was unaware of the drama. Police and ambulance crews were called to the scene at about 1pm and two people were treated for minor injuries. West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed paramedics tended to the two people but said they were both discharged at the scene and didn't require further treatment. The service was unable to confirm whether both patients were occupants of the Jaguar. Witness David Holing, 50, said: 'It was crazy. This silver car barrelled through the car park like something out of the Dukes of Hazzard. 'It hit one parked car and cannoned off into the back of the Renault which shot through the wall like a bullet. 'It's just so lucky the car park wasn't busier and no one got in the way because it could have been a very different story.' The Jaguar clipped a parked car (above) before crashing into the purple Renault and sending it through the wall . It is believed the £40,000 Jaguar belonged to one of the members of the nearby private members' club . The driver of the Jaguar is believed to long-standing member of the private members' club. Ron Peplow, chairman of Stourbridge institute who own the car park, added: 'It's very fortunate no-one was going down the ramp at the time. 'The fire service had been alerted as fuel was believed to be leaking from the vehicle.' West Midlands Police said the collision was 'damage-only' but refused to comment further on the incident.","Driver of £40,000 Jaguar apparently lost control and smashed into vehicles .

"An astronaut conducting a spacewalk outside the ISS today reported dangerous water leak in his helmet - a problem reminiscent of a near-drowning in orbit two years ago. Flight engineer, Terry Virts, reported the water while he waited in the air lock for today's spacewalk to formally conclude. The amount of water increased slightly, but he appeared to be in no immediate danger, said Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, who helped to remove his suit. Terry Virts reported the water while he waited in the air lock for Wednesday's spacewalk to formally conclude. The amount of water increased slightly, but he appeared to be in no immediate danger, said Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, who helped to remove his suit . In 2013, another Italian astronaut, Luca Parmitano, barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk. The water escaped from his suit's cooling system. Nasa spent months investigating the mishap, before clearing the way for more spacewalks. Today's problem didn't impact the spacewalk which saw Virts join fellow astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore on a 6.5 hours mission to prepare parking spots for future 'space taxis'. A camera fixed to the astronaut's spacesuits provided stunning shots of the ISS and Earth, as the astronaut's grapple with lubrication of the latches and brackets. Astronauts floated outside the International Space Station earlier today in the second of three spacewalks to prepare parking spots for future 'space taxis' A camera fixed to the astronaut's spacesuits provided stunning shots of the ISS and Earth, as the astronaut's grapple with lubrication of the latches and brackets . Wilmore took a moment to savor the view. 'I don't think I've seen blue that blue,' he observed above the Caribbean. The spacewalkers struggled to remove a cover protecting the berthing slip, one of two sites being reconfigured for new spaceships under development by Boeing and SpaceX. 'This thing has rigidified out here,' Wilmore radioed to flight controllers in Houston. 'That's as expected, so good luck with that,' replied astronaut Joe Acaba at Mission Control. Station commander Wilmore, call sign EV-1, is wearing a suit with red stripes and is using helmet camera No. 18. Virts, EV-2, is wearing an unmarked suit is using helmetcam 20. The cover's removal was another step to prepare the station for new international docking port adapters that are due to arrive later this year. In this image, Butch Wilmore is dwarfed by Tranquility node as he prepares the ISS for the Bigelow module . 'Orbital sunrise on @Space_Station during the #spacewalk,' Nasa tweeted alongside this stunning image . Station commander Barry 'Butch' Wilmore, 52, and flight engineer Terry Virts (pictured), 47, left the station's Quest airlock just after 7 am EST (1200 GMT) and headed to the space shuttle's old docking port. The adapters will be installed during four more spacewalks Nasa plans in 2015. Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. On Saturday, Wilmore and Virts installed about 340ft (104 metres) of power and data cables to support the new docking systems. During today's spacewalk, scheduled to last about 6.5 hours, they plan to attach two more cables and lubricate the grapple fixture at the end of the station's robot arm. The spacewalkers will also prepare the 'Tranquility' connecting node for the September arrival of an experimental inflatable habitat built by privately-owned Bigelow Aerospace. Las Vegas-based Bigelow is developing free-flying expandable habitats for lease by agencies, researchers and businesses. Nasa is looking at the technology for future human expeditions beyond the station's 260-mile (418-km) high orbit. The station, a partnership of 15 nations, is a collection of laboratories and platforms for materials and life science experiments, Earth studies, physics and other investigations that take advantage of the microgravity environment and unique vantage point of space. The Russian space agency Roscosmos said yesterday it would remain part of the international outpost until 2024, a four-year extension proposed by the US. '#AstroButch captured a #spacewalk selfie with his reflection in @Space_Station radiator panel,' Nasa tweeted .

Taylor and Ashworth admitted to a string of offences including carrying, handling and depositing illegal waste at Blackpool Magistrates' Court yesterday. Victoria Cartmell, prosecuting for Blackpool Council, said waste dumped from the vehicle included asbestos which was left near two schools. She said: 'Waste has been collected illegally around the area. Some of it was hazardous.' 'The prosecution say that these two men were involved in a joint enterprise.They collected waste cheaper than it would cost to dispose of it legally. Therefore to make a profit it had to be dumped illegally.' After the hearing a spokesman for Keep Britain Tidy said: 'This sort of behaviour is symptomatic of wider social decay. Cleaning up litter costs the ratepayer £1 billion a year.' Victoria Cartmell, prosecuting for Blackpool Council, said waste dumped from the vehicle included asbestos which was left near two schools.

"Islamic State militants are planning to murder 150 Christian hostages they kidnapped after sweeping through villages in Syria if the U.S. does not stop air strikes, it has been reported. The abductions of the Christians took place yesterday after ISIS seized two Assyrian communities from Kurdish forces in the northeast province of Hassakeh. The dawn raids are said to have spread 'panic' in the villages, inhabited by the ancient Christian minority along the banks of the Khabur River near the town of Tel Hmar with most coming from the village of Tal Shamiram. Coptic Christians being held by ISIS fighters in Libya. Now the terror group is reportedly planning to threaten to kill another 150 Christian hostages that were seized in Syria . Most of the captives are said to have came from the village of Tal Shamiram, located 50 miles miles southwest of the Hassakeh provincial capital of Qamishli, with others taken from Tal Hermuz . It is thought that the militants are holding the seized women and children in houses in the ISIS-held town of al-Shadadi and using them as human shields from air strikes. Now CNN has reported that the terror group are now planning to release a video as early as today, where they will threaten to kill the hostages if air strikes don't stop. Osama Edward, founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network told the station that the video will be directed to US President Barack Obama and other members of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS. The video is expected to say that the hostages will be killed unless the strikes stop. Meanwhile, it has also been reported that at least 500 families escaped the attack and fled to a nearby church in Hasakah city, where they found refuge. Mr Edward told the IBTimesUK: 'We're involved, many of them are friends and relatives. I'm trying not to get involved and be as objctive and accurate as possible without surrender to personal feelings.' The kidnappings come as ISIS released a video showing militants beheading 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya earlier this month. The United States has condemned the attack on the Assyrian Christians and demanded their immediate release. It is thought that ISIS militants, pictured,  are holding the seized women and children in houses in the ISIS-held town of al-Shadadi and using them as human shields from air strikes . US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: 'ISIS latest targeting of a religious minority is only further testament to its brutal and inhumane treatment of all those who disagree with its divisive goals and toxic beliefs. 'ISIS continues to exact its evil upon innocents of all faiths, and the majority of its victims have been Muslims. 'To bring an end to these daily horrors, we remain committed to leading the international coalition to degrade and defeat ISIS and to working towards a negotiated political solution that stops the bloodshed and secures a future of freedom, justice, and dignity for all Syrians.' After ISIS attacked the two villages as well as the nearby town of Tal Tamr, which remains under Kurdish control, the jihadists set fire to a church there and then installed fighters in the remains of the building, an activist network reported. After ISIS attacked the two villages as well as the nearby town of Tal Tamr, which remains under Kurdish control, the jihadists set fire to a church there (file picture) The US-led coalition fighting ISIS, which has backed Kurdish forces battling the group, then bombed the building on Monday, destroying it and killing IS militants inside, said the Syrian Revolution General Commission. Control of Hassakeh province is largely divided between Kurdish forces, who in some places patrol with regime troops, and ISIS fighters. Since recapturing the strategic border town of Kobane in Aleppo from IS fighters on January 26, Kurdish forces have taken dozens of nearby villages. They have also seized 19 villages from IS in Raqa, where the jihadist group has its de facto capital, and another 30 villages and hamlets in Hassakeh. The Kurdish advances have been aided by the US-led air strikes, including a series in Hassakeh on Monday that killed at least 14 IS fighters, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.","ISIS are reportedly planning to release a video showing Christian hostages .

"Humbled: Professor Paul Frampton said his time in the notorious prison left him wiser, more empathetic and less arrogant . An eminent British scientist told today how he witnessed a brutal murder while serving time for drug smuggling in a 'hellhole' South American prison. Oxford-educated professor Paul Frampton, 71, was jailed for trafficking cocaine after falling victim to an Internet scam involving a bikini model. The renowned physicist believed he was taking a suitcase to a voluptuous 32-year-old brunette he had fallen for online. But police found two kilos of cocaine in a secret compartment in the bag when professor Frampton was stopped as he boarded a plane in Argentina. The respected academic spent nine months inside the notorious Villa Devoto jail in Buenos Aires, locked up 24 hours a day with violent criminals. In his first interview since serving his sentence, professor Frampton told how he watched in horror as a fellow inmate was stabbed to death by a Colombian hitman. Speaking at his new home in Oxford, he told Mail Online: 'The prison was a squalid place and we were treated like animals in a zoo. 'There were thousands of cockroaches crawling all over the floors and walls. 'We used a hole in the floor for a toilet and had just two showers between the 80 men on my wing. 'I can honestly say it nearly killed me. I believe I would have died if they had not let me out when they did. 'There was a lot of violence. I saw a man murdered just a few feet away from me. 'I was chatting to a young Colombian inmate who had just arrived. The rumour was he had murdered a policeman. Married model Denise Milani, had no idea her identity was being used, was shocked at the sting . Alluring: Former Miss Bikini World Denise Milani was used to lure Professor Frampton into carrying two kilos of cocaine that were hidden in a bag . Innocent: Denise Milani was blissfully unaware she was being used by South American mafia as bait to lure Professor Frampton to carry a bag full of drugs . 'He was a bit wild-eyed but we were getting on fine, then suddenly out of nowhere he had a knife in his hand, pulled from his shirtsleeve. 'It was about six inches long and very sharp. He leapt up and attacked another Colombian. He murdered him right in front of me. 'He went straight for the neck, for the carotid artery and almost decapitated him. 'There was blood everywhere, the man collapsed and died instantly on the spot. I was in shock. The murderer was restrained and I never saw him again. 'The rumour was he was a professional assassin working for the Medellin cocaine cartel. There was always the threat of violence in the prison but that was the only murder I saw. Notorious: Prisoners protest over conditions at Villa Devoto jail in Buenos Aires. Professor Paul Frampton said the nine months there 'nearly killed' him . Hidden: The packets containing two kilos of cocaine were hidden inside a bag Professor Frampton was tricked into carrying by South American drug traffickers . 'I had nightmares about it.' The scientist continued: 'I was nicknamed Prof by the other inmates. 'Drugs were rife in the prison and I was surrounded by inmates taking crack and cocaine every day. The guards were corrupt and brought it in. 'The inmates frequently offered me drugs but I wasn't interested. 'I was lucky because a major smuggler called Vito took me under his wing and looked after me, so for the most part people left me alone. 'But the conditions were terrible and I lost around 25lbs as the food was mostly stale bread.' Mr Frampton, originally from Kidderminster, Worcs, was on a wing of 80 foreign drug smugglers, all sharing one large cell with 40 bunk bolted to the concrete floor. The prison, built for 800 prisoners but holding twice as many, is renowned as one of the toughest in South America, and was the scene of a riot in which 62 inmates were killed in 1978. Mr Frampton arrived in handcuffs in January 2012 after being stopped with two kilos of cocaine at Ezeiza International Aiport in Buenos Aires. His bizarre story began two months earlier when he struck up an online romance after joining a dating website, while working at the University of North Carolina in the US. He admits he was lonely and looking for love after splitting from his wife Anne-Marie seven years previously. Professor Frampton, who has written hundreds of academic papers including some co-authored with Nobel prize winners, has now written a book about his ordeal called 'Tricked! The Story of an Internet Scam'. Mug: Lovelorn Professor Frampton thought he was chatting to a bikini model online. It was in fact members of the South American mafia who tricked him into carrying two kilos of cocaine . Brutal: Renowned physicist Professor Frampton saw another inmate brutally murdered by a hitman during his time at Villa Devoto jail in Buenos Aires . The professor believed he was romancing a bikini model called Denise Milani, winner of Miss Bikini World in 2007. He began exchanging hundreds of messages with his online 'girlfriend' before he agreed to fly to Bolivia to meet her in person. In fact, unbeknown to him, he was communicating with drug traffickers from the South American mafia, who were posing as Ms Milani. The model had no idea her identity had been taken over and played no part in the sting. Mr Frampton admits he was 'incredibly naïve' for falling for the scam, which he says was 'incredibly convincing and professional.' He said: 'I was very attracted to Denise. She's obviously a very attractive woman physically, but it also seemed that she was also very interesting to chat to and was very interested in my work. 'She told me she was bored of younger men chasing her for her looks and wanted to be with someone more mature. 'I was foolish enough to believe what I read. I wouldn't say I was in love as we never met in person or even spoke on the phone. 'But I believed we had a genuine relationship.' Honeytrap: Bikini model Denise Milani had no idea she was being used to lure Professor Frampton into a trap . Lonely: Professor Frampton was looking for love after splitting from his wife when he started what he thought was an online relationship with bikini model Denise Milani . When the professor arrived in La Paz in Bolivia he received a message from 'Denise' saying she had flown to Brussels for a photoshoot. She asked him to pick up a suitcase she had forgotten and bring it with him to Belgium. He picked the case up from a man who came to his hotel, but later decided to return to the US via Argentina as he was frustrated at not having met Denise. He was checked in to a flight to Miami via Lima, Peru, when he was stopped by armed police at the Buenos Aires airport. He said: 'They cut open the suitcase and found packets of cocaine weighing 2 kilos. 'It was surreal and confusing. It never entered my head the suitcase would contain anything illegal.' Professor Frampton was jailed for four years and eight months, reduced to four years on appeal. He was so convinced of the scam that even after his arrest he believed he had been communicating with 'Denise'. He said: 'The other prisoners laughed at me. They couldn't believe how naïve I was. 'But I had spent my life sheltered in an ivory tower and had no idea there were professional scammers who would operate like that.' Professor Frampton lost his job at the University of North Carolina and is looking for a new position. He spent nine months in prison before being released to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest at a friend's house in Buenos Aires, because of severe health problems he was suffering in jail. He was freed from house arrest last June, and moved to the UK last month, where he continues to research particle phenomenology and theoretical cosmology. Moving on: Professor Paul Frampton, 71, at his new home in Oxford. The honeytrap victim is seeking a way back into academia following his time in an Argentinian jail . He currently holds no position and says he would welcome a new academic post. He said: 'Prison has definitely made me wiser, more empathetic, less arrogant, more sympathetic. 'I met some very good people and also some very cruel and despicable people. I am much less naïve now. And I won't be trying Internet dating ever again.'","Professor Paul Frampton sentenced to four years for cocaine smuggling .

"More than a quarter of British Muslims have sympathy for the motives behind the attack on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, which left 12 people dead, a survey shows. The new poll also revealed that 32 per cent of respondents were 'not surprised' that the massacre took place after the publication printed a number of images of the Prophet Mohammed. And more than 10 per cent of the 1,000 British Muslims interviewed agreed that the magazine 'deserved' to be attacked. Scroll down for video . More than a quarter of British Muslims have sympathy for the motives behind the attack on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, a new survey reveals. Above, British Muslims at prayer . Killers: Brothers Cherif (left) and Said Kouachi (right) who killed 12 people during the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris. It was the first in a spree of killings across the French capital last month . The survey also found that almost one in 10 knew other Muslims who had strong sympathies with those fighting for Al-Qaeda or Islamic State. The figures were branded as 'worrying' by Former faith and communities minister Baroness Warsi, who said they needed to be 'unpicked further'. Twelve people, including eight journalists, were murdered when masked gunmen stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices, in the first of a spree of killings across the French capital last month. The satirical newspaper made a name for itself as an irreverent and often provocative newspaper after taking a number of controversial swipes at Islam and other religions. When polled, 27 per cent said they agreed with the statement 'I have some sympathy for the motives behind the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in Paris'. 'Worrying': Lady Warsi, the first female Muslim in the Cabinet, said the figures had to be 'unpicked' The new survey, conducted by ComRes for BBC Radio 4, revealed that almost 80 per cent of British Muslims found it deeply offensive when images depicting the Prophet were published. While more than one in three said that they understood the motives of those who launched attacks in the name of Islam because the religion had been insulted. Speaking to the Today programme on Radio 4, Lady Warsi, the first female Muslim in the Cabinet, said: ‘These are as far as I’m concerned worrying statistics. 'I’d have like to unpick that further and the reasoning’s why they came to that decision.' She added that a citizenship survey should be reintroduced to provide the Government with a 'solid evidence base' and to help them try and understand the 'changing picture' of Britain. The poll also found that a majority of Muslims - 85 per cent - said they felt no sympathy for those who want to fight against Western interests. The same proportion of respondents said they oppose violence against people who publish images depicting the Prophet Mohammed. Nearly three million Muslims live in Britain, but instances of extremist ideology have led to growing unease among many and fears of rising prejudice. The poll also suggests that almost half of British Muslims believe they face discrimination because of their faith and that Britain is becoming less tolerant, while the same percentage feel prejudice against Islam makes it difficult being a Muslim in the UK. More than a third of those interviewed felt that most Britons do not trust Muslims and a fifth said they thought Western liberal society could never be compatible with Islam. Of those polled, 95 per cent felt a loyalty to Britain, while 93 per cent believed that Muslims in Britain should always obey British laws. And Muslim women were more likely than men to feel unsafe in Britain, the survey revealed. When asked about the place of faith schools in Britain, more than a third said they would want their children to go to a Muslim state school if they had the choice. And only 55 per cent of those polled felt the Muslim Council of Britain adequately represented the views of Muslims in the country. A poll conducted by ComRes for BBC Radio 4 questioned 1,000 Muslims living in Britain on a range of issues affecting their daily lives. Key findings revealed their attitudes towards extremism, prejudice and terrorist attacks. 8 per cent of respondents said they know Muslims who feel strongly sympathetic towards people fighting for IS and al-Qaeda . One in three said they would like their children to go a Muslim state school if they had the choice . 13 per cent agreed with the statement, 'I would rather socialise with Muslims than non-Muslims' More than a third of those interviewed felt that most Britons do not trust Muslims . 46 per cent believe the nation is becoming less tolerant of Muslims.

Elizabeth Kelly (above), 50, of Toronto, stated in papers filed on Friday that Steven Joyce sexually assaulted her . Kelly alleges that the incident happened in October of last year, when she traveled with a friend to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to celebrate her birthday. Joyce, 48, met the two women and they went to his father's $30million yacht, Destination Fox Harb’r Too. In and interview with the National Post, Kelly says she had consensual sex with Joyce when they first arrived, and that later in the evening he asked for a threesome with both women. After the other woman refused, Kelly claims Joyce 'grabbed her arm and tried to pull her onto the bed with them.' During this scuffle Kelly claimed she injured her wrist when she was thrown off the bed. Later that night the Kelly and Joyce were in the hot tub, and that the incident happened when she got out of the tub, naked, and put on her robe. 'Steven Joyce, without warning, suddenly and inexplicably forced the plaintiff face down on a chaise lounge and subjected the plaintiff to a vicious sexual battery,' Kelly claims in court papers. She also states she 'screamed that he was hurting her and she begged him to stop.' The incident allegedly happened on Joyce's father's $30million yacht, Destination Fox Harb’r Too (above) Kelly, who had previously dated Joyce, said he was apologetic the next morning, but after speaking with a friend she realized the severity of the situation. 'It doesn’t matter if it’s on a $30-million yacht or in the street.” Ms. Kelly said. 'It affected me a lot more than I realized. As glamorous a surrounding as it was, it just wasn’t cool,' Ms. Kelly said. 'That is not what love looks like.' Joyce's father said his son did not have his permission to be on the boat and then added; 'Everything I’ve heard so far is an accusation of a young person who was likely making allegations that are unfounded.' Joyce also said his father had nothing to do with the incident and is named only because he owns the boat. Kelly is seeking $5.7million in damages.","Elizabeth Kelly, 50, of Toronto, stated in papers filed on Friday that Steven Joyce sexually assaulted her on board a yacht belonging to his father .

"For most people, honeymooning involves stretching out on the beach and doing very little. But not this couple. Anne and Mike Howard, from New York, USA, spent 675 days travelling the world after they decided that a two-week holiday just wasn't enough when they tied the knot. The adventurous spouses returned to the US one year ago after visiting a total of 302 places across 33 countries, and six continents - and all on a budget of around just £50 a day. Scroll down for video . Honeymooners Anne and Mike Howard, pictured here, at Eduardo Avaroa National Reserve, in Bolivia spent 675 days travelling the world . The Howards pose infront of the spectacular scenery of the Fitzroy mountain in the Southern Patagonian Ice Field in Patagonia . Mike and Anne Howard's trip allowed the couple to experience: . 140 hikes . 105 buses . 72 luxury hotels . 41 safaris . 39 scuba dives . 18 Couchsurfs . 12 extreme sports . 8 glacier treks . 6 volunteer projects . The Howards logged a total of 125,675 miles, 140 hikes, 105 buses, 72 luxury hotels, 41 safaris, 39 scuba dives, 18 Couchsurfs, 12 extreme sports, 8 glacier treks and 6 volunteer projects. Anne, 32, said: 'When choosing a honeymoon destination, we realised the list was too long and life was too short. 'We had money saved, no kids, good health, and there is a lot of world to see - what better time to travel than now. 'We believe honeymoons are about starting a life together with a bang - having memorable and meaningful experiences rather than just splashing out on luxury. Mike, 37, said: 'Instead of spending all of our funds in a couple of weeks, we stretched our budget to last a couple of years. 'We saw the most beautiful places, immersed ourselves in other cultures, embarked on big adventures and created memories for the rest of our lives. 'And this time as newlyweds seemed like the perfect opportunity to embrace our freedom, good health, and celebrate and nurture our marriage in an extraordinary way. 'So we turned our honeymoon into the adventure of a lifetime.'

The happy couple say their lengthy trip allowed them to immerse themselves in other cultures and create meaningful memories . Angelica Malin, editor of online travel and lifestyle magazine About Time says: 'This couple did what we all dream of; escaping the 9-5 and travelling the world, each day more adventure-filled than the next. 'Holidays and honeymoons are often too rushed as trying to pack everything in at once. Here's five ways to make the most of your trip: . 1. Planning - make sure you use websites, guide books and friends to find out what's best and what can be missed in the city . 2. Get out early - carpe diem! You'll get the most out of your trip by getting out of bed. 3. Look for homestays and flat shares - if you want a taste of local culture, homestays are a great way to experience the local culture first hand . 4. Get flight ready - keep flight day stress to minimum by checking in online, and try to take minimal luggage. 5. Look at seasonal timings - some countries may be cheaper to travel to at different times of the year, check out which destinations have more favourable flight prices in the less fashionable seasons.' Anne Howard makes use of the local transport in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The average honeymoon costs around £4,000 for eight days . Kayaking Milford Sound, in New Zealand. The adventurous couple travelled to six continents on a budget of less than £50 per day . 'Our average cost was around $40 a day per person - but this is an average as countries like England, Japan and Australia were more expensive than places like Vietnam, Turkey, and Bolivia. 'For example Norway cost around $75 a day each, but south east Asia worked out to be less than $20 per person. 'We kept our lodging costs low and had more local experiences by opting for homestays, housesitting, volunteering, couchsurfing. 'And through our partnership with Honeymoons.com, we occasionally exchanged our photography and writing skills for luxury stays.

"Seven men sought by police investigating racist chanting at a mainline station following a Chelsea Champions League football match earlier this month have all been identified, police said. Britsh Transport Police (BTP) said they would be interviewed in due course. BTP had released images of seven men taken at St Pancras International station in London at around 8pm on February 18. The British Transport Police released images of seven men, believed to be Chelsea supporters, who arrived back in St Pancras Station following their return from Paris after last week's Champions League footage . Officers confirmed they had identified seven men in the CCTV footage and will interview them 'in due course' Passengers travelling through the station complained over the allegedly racist chants as Chelsea fans returned to London following their Champions League match against Paris St Germain. It is the second investigation into allegedly racist chanting involving Chelsea fans attending the same game. This was the day after an incident on the Paris Metro before Chelsea's match with Paris St Germain when a man was subjected to alleged racist abuse. In a statement today, solicitor John Kaye, who has been engaged by Chelsea fan Jamie Fairbairn, 23, said his client had accepted being among those in the carriage of the Metro train in Paris during the incident involving a black man, Souleymane Sylla, on the evening of February 17. He added that Mr Fairbairn denies preventing Mr Sylla from boarding or using words of a racist or threatening nature, and also denies saying anything of a racist nature during his visit to Paris or later at St Pancras. He said Mr Fairbairn was not even present during the alleged racist chanting incident at St Pancras. The solicitor added that media interest in the story had forced Mr Fairbairn to move away from his home and he had been suspended from work. 'On behalf of Mr Fairbairn, I have been in contact with the Metropolitan Police to offer Mr Fairbairn's assistance as a witness,' Mr Kaye said.","British Transport Police issued CCTV grabs of seven men for identification .

"Jack Fox fell 2,500 feet down a mountain side during a skiing trip with his school. Amazingly he survived with only ice burns to his arms . A British schoolboy who miraculously survived a 2,500ft fall in the Alps has told how he bounced off rocks and ice as he tumbled down the mountain. Jack Fox, 14, stopped to take a photo on a rocky ledge during a school ski trip to Flattach near Salzburg, Austria last week. But despite falling the equivalent of two and a half Eiffel Towers, the Year 10 student survived with just ice burns to his arms. Jack, an accomplished skier from Southport, Merseyside, fell on the very last run of his school’s six-day, £850-per-head break. A group of eight children were with an Austrian ski instructor when they took their skis off so they could take pictures of the scenery. But as he lined up his photo, Jack slid over the edge and  plunged down the mountain-side. He said: 'I thought that was it – that I’d be killed. I remembered it was a complete sheer drop to the mountain floor. I said to myself: ""Jack, it’s only you that could do this."" 'But as I came down the mountain I kept trying to dig my feet in and pull up with my arms. 'I was crashing through ice and bouncing off rocks. It was terrifying. It felt like I was falling forever. I kept thinking ""How much more of this can I take?"" 'Eventually I came to a halt. I checked everywhere to make sure I hadn’t broken anything and it all seemed fine. 'When I looked back up the mountain I thought: ""I've just fallen from there"". It was only then that I noticed the pain in my arms'. His cries for help were heard by an extreme skier and rescuers soon arrived and airlifted him off the mountain. He was later handed the smashed ski helmet that saved his life, which had virtually disintegrated during the fall. He said: 'It was a sunny day and other people had taken their helmets off to take pictures. I kept mine on – and I’m so glad I did. Without it I wouldn’t have survived.' Doctors found he had severe ice burns on his left arm and only slightly less serious ones on his right. He was kept in overnight because of the concussion he had suffered. After being flown back to Britain he went into surgery at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, Liverpool, for a deep skin scrub under anaesthetic. 'That was worse than the fall itself,’ said Jack, a pupil at Tarleton Academy. Jack, pictured with his mother Amanda, 41, and brother, Ryan, 13, had stopped to take a photo when he fell . Describing the fall, he added: 'One moment it was fine, the next my boots were slipping and I was gone. 'I heard later the rest of the party were crying and praying for me. They thought I was a gonner, and the instructor was pretty upset. 'I know I’m really lucky. My teachers said I should go out and by a lottery ticket – I was bound to win'. Jack’s father Stewart Fox, 48, found out about the accident when he received a call from his son’s teacher. He said: 'I got the call from this distressed teacher and because of the tone of his voice, the first thing I asked was ""Is he alive?"" 'When you pack your lad away to Austria on a skiing trip and get a teacher in distress, you think the worst. 'He was with the advanced party and went to the top of the mountain and to a well known beauty spot up on a ledge.' The accident happened in the Alps near Flattach, not far from Salzburg, Austria. File photo . Mr Fox added: 'Apparently all these people were taking photos at this area. He was facing forward and taking photos of the view. 'He just lost his footing. He’s very keen to stress he was not taking a selfie because it makes him sound stupid. It could have so easily been the dreaded call.” 'His friends were all praying and in tears at the top. They couldn’t go and look because they would follow him and they would be like lemmings. They all thought he was dead. 'When the teacher told me he was alive, my thoughts went from sheer dread to relief. He could very very easily have died. 'They told him in the helicopter it was 2,500ft he fell. He tells me he used his boots to try and dig in and slow himself down and then as soon as he did they gripped and they flipped over. I don’t think he realised how fast he was going.' His mother Amanda, 41, had nothing but praise for Jack's teacher, Jack Snowden and the rest of the teachers. 'We’ve absolutely no complaints. They were brilliant'.","14-year-old  was on school trip to Austria when he stopped to take photo .

"They may not appear to be related, but hippos have long been thought to share an ancient ancestor with whales. But up until now, a huge age gap between  in the fossil record has prevented scientists from confirming their theory. Now researchers have uncovered 28 million-year-old molars of a great-great grandfather of the hippo which has finally provided direct proof of their link with whales. A great-great grandfather of the hippopotamus likely swam from Asia to Africa some 35 million years ago, long before the arrival of the lion, rhino, zebra and giraffe Pictured is a view of one of the fossils that confirmed this. It shows an upper molar of a species known as Epirigenys lokonensis . 'Epiri' means hippo in the Turkana language and Lokone after the discovery site. The species was about the size of a sheep, weighing in at 100kg (220lbs), which is about a twentieth the size of today's 'common hippopotamus', a sub-Saharan giant. It may have spent much of its time immersed in water. E. lokonensis was not a direct forefather of today's hippo, belonging instead to a side branch. But it lived much closer in time to the ancestor from which they both branched off, allowing for inferences to be drawn about the ancient animal. Dental analysis led the team to conclude that E. lokonensis and the hippo both came from an anthracothere forefather, which migrated from Asia to Africa about 35 million years go. As Africa was then an island surrounded by water, it likely swam there. The previously unknown, long-extinct relative also confirmed that cetaceans - the group to which whales, dolphins and porpoises belong - are in fact the hippo's closest living cousins. 'The origins of the hippopotamus have been a mystery until now,' Fabrice Lihoreau, a palaeontologist at France's University of Montpellier. 'Now we can say that hippos came from anthracothere' - an extinct group of plant-eating, semi-aquatic mammals with even-toed hooves. Until now, the oldest known fossil of a hippo ancestor dated from about 20 million years ago, while cetacean remains aged 53 million years have been found. The remains of a 28-million-year-old animal discovered in Kenya's Lokone Hills has provided an important piece of the puzzle, according to a study in the journal Nature Communications. It has been name Epirigenys lokonensis - 'epiri' means hippo in the Turkana language and Lokone after the discovery site. The species was about the size of a sheep, weighing in at 100kg (220lbs), which is about a twentieth the size of today's 'common hippopotamus', a sub-Saharan giant. It may have spent much of its time immersed in water. E. lokonensis was not a direct forefather of today's hippo, belonging instead to a side branch. But it lived much closer in time to the ancestor from which they both branched off, allowing for inferences to be drawn about the ancient animal. The anthrocothere, shown here, is believed to be a common ancestor to hippos. These were an extinct group of plant-eating, semi-aquatic mammals with even-toed hooves . Pictured is a simplified family tree showing the relation between hippos, anthracotheres and cetaceans and the key position of the new species from Kenya . This image shows the evolutionnary transition of the upper molar from an anthracothere (left), Epirigenys (middle), and a primitive hippo (right). Black circle are the cusps, black line are the crests and in orange the styles show enamel . Dental analysis led the team to conclude that E. lokonensis and the hippo both came from an anthracothere forefather, which migrated from Asia to Africa about 35 million years go. As Africa was then an island surrounded by water, it likely swam there. This means the ancestors of hippos 'were among the first large mammals to colonise the African continent, long before those of any of the large carnivores, giraffes or bovines,' all of which arrived only about 18 million years ago. The modern-day hippo evolved independently in Africa, and is a creature truly endemic to the continent, according to the research paper. 'We filled a gap in the evolutionary history of the hippo, bringing us closer to the point of divergence from their modern-day sister group of cetaceans,' said Professor Lihoreau. The right image shows a Epirigenys lokonensis fossil with molars (right) compared to the left of a hippopotamid fossil. The left image shows a hippopotamus at the chobe National Park, Botswana, Africa .

Before the Reds shelled out £22m for the Uruguayan, Suarez had already developed a 'bad-boy' reputation with Ajax in Holland. His play-acting antics were one thing, but in November 2010, a new side to the forward was born. As PSV and Ajax players scrapped off the ball, Suarez chomped down on opposing midfielder Otman Bakkal's shoulder.

Suarez had already been given an eight-match ban after being charged with racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra during a Premier League game in 2011, before biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in a  2013 fixture. He went on to score the equaliser but after that, his reputation was set in the eyes of the British public, and press. 'His behaviour is not befitting of any player wearing a Liverpool shirt,' chief executive Ian Ayre said. Brendan Rodgers added: 'Players are always replaceable, it does not matter how good they think they are.' Suarez strongly denied the accusations of racism against Evra, but had no choice but to apologise after the incident with Ivanovic. He had lost his temper, and inexcusably bitten the Serbian defender's shoulder. The FA handed out a 10-game ban to Suarez, who then tried to angle a move away from Anfield. Arsenal laid down £35m to give the striker a fresh start, but Liverpool rejected the bid and placed their trust in his ability. They weren't wrong, as Suarez went on to net 31 goals and become the top scorer in the 2013/14 Premier League season despite missing the first five games.

However, he was about to return to the centre of attention for all the wrong reasons. The prolific star first said he 'lost his balance' when appearing to bite Italy's Giorgio Chiellini in Uruguay's final group stage game. Again, his side went on to score a crucial late goal. Chiellini protested to the referee, lowering his shirt to present bite marks on his shoulder as the pair clashed in the box as a cross came in. The third bite in his professional career earned him a nine-game ban from world football, his eventual statement apologising to the defender was similar to that of the sorrow he expressed to Ivanovic. 'The truth is that my colleague Giorgio Chiellini suffered the physical result of a bite in the collision he suffered with me,' said Suarez. 'I deeply regret what occurred.'

"The head of Britain’s new press regulator has said he is ‘determined’ for the press to take its own code of practice seriously. Sir Alan Moses, chairman of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), said: ‘We are determined to be, for the first time, a regulator. The Press Complaints Commission was not a regulator, it was a complaints handler and we wish to be an independent regulator. ‘The press said they wanted an independent regulator and we are going to hold them to that and we believe that we can achieve that.’ Ipso chairman Sir Alan Moses, pictured, told MPs that he was determined his office would remain independent . He added that it was his belief that complaints were being dealt with more speedily and taken ‘far more seriously than previously’. The former appeal court judge said he had only agreed to take the job last year after receiving assurances that he would be able to operate independently from the Press. He said it was too early to declare success, but told MPs on the Commons culture, media and sport committee that the regulator was already having a significant impact on the way the media deals with complaints. Earlier, a pro-privacy campaigner told the culture select committee that she does not have faith in the new press regulator because it is the ‘same old thing’. Hannah Weller, founder of the Protect campaign for children’s privacy, said she had initially ‘great hope’ following the Leveson inquiry but had been left disappointed. She told the hearing: ‘I think it (Ipso) is the same old thing, it’s changed its outfit and changed its name but it’s behaving in same way. ‘Even in the short-term period post-Leveson, post the introduction of Ipso, who is to say when the heat is off in five years time it’s not going to go back to old ways? ‘I don’t think it’s independent enough and I don’t think the general public have faith in it.’ Sir Alan, pictured, is a former appeal court judge and said Ipso was already having an impact with the press .","Sir Alan Moses said he had no intention of being 'a complaints handler'

Daniel Radcliffe conceded he was a 'fag hag' Sessums was one of a few celebrity interviewers who was treated like an insider by stars while writing for Andy Warhol's Interview, Vanity Fair in the 1990s, as well as later interviews for the Daily Beast, Allure and Parade. Michael J. Fox discovered the magnitude of Sessums' sexual obsessions after discovering a piece of paper the author accidentally left behind during an interview with every written word being sexual: 'P****. D***. C***. F***'. At an Oscar after-party in 1995, Tony Curtis was checking out Sessums and confessed that he once had a crush on Yul Brynner. 'I think that's why you're making me feel so odd. You kinda look like him. I haven't slept with a man in decades, but the night is young', Curtis told him. Daniel Radcliffe, who became a star through the Harry Potter films, revealed how 'more collegial and camp and…well, let's face it: gay' – working in the theatre was versus making the Harry Potter films. He said: 'For a lot of straight guys and I know I'm guilty of it sometimes. When you know a gay guy has a crush on you it is the most flattering thing. Hugh Jackman told Sessums he wished he had been around in the 70s to experience the mattress room at Plato's Retreat, a sex club in NYC . 'Yeah, I'm a fag hag, to use your term. 'I know I definitely caught it. Absolutely. My mom was a casting director and my dad was a literary agent and I was surrounded by gay men from a very young age. And I was the only boy in my class at school who had that kind of relationship with gay men. 'That's one thing Harry Potter has done if nothing else. It has restored the reputation of the English boarding school. It has made it something other than a hotbed of sexuality.' Sessums smoked a joint with Heath Ledger in Prague and later told Ledger's wife, actress Michelle Williams about their shared experience. He thought it was cool the way they had watched the moon rise over the Vitava River in Prague while taking tokes and getting really stoned until Heath died of a drug overdose - and then it didn't seem so cool anymore. Michelle thanked him for sharing that memory. He had an intimate conversation with Diane Sawyer in her ABC World News office in New York in January 2010, while discussing a cover story for Parade magazine. Sessums looked frayed from a night of sex and drug bingeing and Sawyer noticed. Sessums asked Diane how so much travel covering breaking news stories affected her marriage with director/writer Mike Nichols, who died suddenly in November 2014. 'He loves – God bless him – seeing the story with me in it', she said. 'And he's excited to hear when I get home how it smelt 'n' felt. How hot it was. What it tasted like. So he loved seeing me stretched flat out'. 'Mike is a genius at helping you know who you are and helping you know what is real and what is not real in the world and keeping you aimed toward a North Star'. 'And I love the fact that this son and grandson of blazing Jewish intellectuals ends up with this Methodist girl from the South'. After listening to so many stories from others, Sessum's life was on the line. He needed help. His drug and sex addiction was killing him -- the crystal meth, the cocaine and anonymous sex with male prostitutes from online sex services. He learned that he might find forgiveness in a climb up Mount Kilimanjaro and emailed Martha Stewart knowing she had once made the climb. Her words of advice were' 'Don't take the altitude for granted'. He took Hemingway's words to heart in The Snows of Kilimanjaro: 'You can't die if you don't give up'. But on reaching the top in 2006 he hadn't found the epiphany he was seeking. 'I looked out at the world below and all that I had left behind – my fear of death and yet my longing for it. I shivered in the unrelenting wind and heard that howl my heart had finally found. I turned and reached the summit'. The mountain forgave him, but he still had further to go to forgive himself. He would eventually find it after a spiritual pilgrimage on the Camino de Santiago de Compostela, more than 500 miles across northern Spain that pilgrims have walked for over two thousand years. That coupled with walking the deserted and lonely winter beaches of Provincetown at the outermost tip of Cape Cod.

"Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin has said Nasa must commit to building a permanent settlement on the surface of Mars and sending astronauts there to colonise it. The second man to walk on the Moon told a special Senate subcomittee hearing that the United States needed to accept that crews sent to the Martian surface would not be coming back. Instead he said the US space agency needed to focus on sending people to Mars to stay to avoid the huge cost of bringing crews back home. Former Nasa astronaut Buzz Aldrin (above) said the US needs to commit to building a permanent Mars base . The made his comments while outlining his vision for how the US should lead the race to the red planet at the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness. If private space venture Mars One has its way, Nasa could be beaten to put human feet on the surface of Mars. It is aiming to send four people chosen from a longlist of 100 applicants to the red planet in 2025. The organisers behind the project play to send a supply mission to Mars as soon as October 2016 followed by a settlement rover in 2018 that would prepare for the astronauts. However the proposed mission has been widely criticised ever since it was first announced in 2011. Lack of funding, no signs of technology development and an overly ambitious ‘reality TV’ approach have all been cited as reasons that Mars One will never be more than a pipe dream. Others have warned that the project does not have access to the required techology to meet its timescales. Astronaut Chris Hadfield, former commander of the ISS, is among the critics, describing the project as having a 'self-defeating optimism'. Igore Mitrofanov of the Space Research Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences has warned that the doses of radiation that the colonisers could receive during the mission could pose a significant risk. He warned that the US risked being caught up and even beaten by other countries like China who are looking at sending people to Mars. The Apollo 11 pilot, who is now a campaigner for missions to Mars, said the next US president needed to commit by 2019 to building a permanently manned Martian base. In his evidence presented to the hearing, Mr Aldrin said: 'If we wish to retain American leadership in space, I believe that early in the next administration, the nation must commit to developing a permanent presence on Mars.' He added: 'Focus on sending people to Mars to stay. The huge cost driver for Mars missions is the cost of bringing everyone back home after a relatively brief stay. 'I envision a program of settlement that schedules most of the crews who go to Mars will remain and establish a permanent settlement there.' The former astronaut, who now spends much of his time promoting the US space programme around the world, was giving evidence alongside two other former Nasa astronauts Walt Cunningham, who was the pilot on Apollo 7, and space shuttle mission specialist Michael Massimino. Mr Aldrin, who along with Neil Armstrong stepped onto the Moon for the first time on July 20 1969, said that since the Apollo moon landings, the US had failed to demonstrate that it led the world in space exploration. He said that repeating the 'flags and footprints' approach taken by the Apollo missions to the Moon, would not be enough to keep the US in the lead of the space race. Buzz Aldrin said the US space programme needed to go beyond putting 'flags and footprints' on Mars (above) Mr Aldrin said America had lost its leadership of the space race since the Apollo missions to the Moon . The 85-year-old said: 'Over the next few years we must choose whether we are to go forward as a nation and lead the extension of global civilization to a permanent presence beyond Low Earth Orbit, or to allow American leadership in space to erode over the next decades. 'American leadership is inspiring the world by consistently doing what no other nation is capable of doing. We demonstrated that for a brief time 45 years ago. I do not believe we have done it since. 'Another Apollo like mission to put flags and footprints on Mars does not ensure sustained leadership, and restarting a failed constellation program will only require one small step for China to catch up.' Mr Aldrin was the second man to walk on the Moon (above) after Neil Armstrong on Apollo 11, but says the US must now focus on putting astronauts on the surface of Mars where they will stay for the rest of their lives . Mr Aldrin has compiled what he describes as his Unified Space Vision, which includes using robots to build habitation structures on the Moon by around 2028 that could support future missions to Mars. He said that much of this could be conducted by commercial companies and for scientific activities. Setting out a timetable for the missions, he suggested deploying a cycling spacecraft that perpetually orbits between the Earth and Mars to reduce the amount of fuel needed to send habitable structures to Mars, which could be sent in advance of any astronauts. He added that most pioneers to the red planet would not be expected to return. He said that initially a crew of three could land on the Martian Moon Phobos before later transferring to the red planet itself. He said that this would probably not happen much before 2034. He said: 'Every four and a half years the population of Mars will continue to grow as recurring outbound cyclers bring additional crews of up to 9 new inhabitants. 'The list of potential tasks the surface inhabitants of 18 might accomplish is far too long to enumerate in my remaining time, but I would just note that Steven Squires, the Principle Investigator of the Mars Pathfinder mission . once said that a single crew could accomplish in one week what took two rovers five years to do.' During his evidence Mr Aldrin attempted to lighten the mood of the hearing by showing off a pair of planetary themed socks to those around him. Mr Aldrin's evidence was briefly interupted when his mobile phone buzzed loudly, causing him to sheepishly fumble in is pocket. After 10 seconds of silence, US Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican chairing the hearing, asked: 'Just tell us if that's a call from the space station.'","Buzz Aldrin was giving evidence at a special US Senate hearing on space .

"The Brazilian government has deployed forces to one of Rio de Janeiro's largest slums - in a clean-up operation which aims to reduce crime in the city ahead of the World Cup. Federal forces are here pictured entering the violence-plagued Complexo da Mare - one of Brazil's biggest slums - 'favelas' in Portuguese. These pictures show troops storming the favela bearing guns in bullet-proof vehicles while a helicopter circles above. The faces of the 130,000 residents who live on the Mare complex have also been pictured. Mare is formed of 16 separate communities and has been riddled with drugs and dominated by gangs and militias. It is close to Rio's international airport, which means that visitors must drive past it on their way into the city. Senior officials have denied that the Mare clean-up is related to the World Cup - claiming that they aim to improve the lives of Rio favela residents. Today, daily life in one of Rio de Janerio's biggest shanty towns was disrupted by military personnel in an attempted to clean up the city before the World Cup . Residents looked on bemusedly as armed federal officers in bullet-proof vests strode through the run-down streets in a bid to crack down on crime . This emaciated horse eating from a bin is not an uncommon sight in the violence-plagued Complexo da Mare, which is controlled by gangs and militias . Tanks were even rolled out into the complex early Sunday morning to carry more than 1,000 police and further military personnel on an impromptu patrol . Helicopters circle the Mare slum complex in Rio de Janeiro. The slum - 'favela' in Portuguese - is home to some 130,000 residents . Residents walk through the slum as dozens of police officers, in camouflaged uniform hold machine guns from behind heavy-duty navy trucks . Residents are seen walking out of the favela as armed troops in bullet-proof vests storm in . Locals carried on with daily life as police officers and marines in uniform filed through the narrow streets. No shots have been fired so far . Police in the city have attracted widespread criticism for their heavy-handed approach to controlling drug crime in the city. Last year, police were charged after bricklayer Amarildo de Souza, who lived in the city's biggest shanty town Roncinha, was tortured and murdered. Police were then charged with hiding his body . A special operations officer is pictured here in front of a graffiti drawing of Rio's symbolic statue: Christ the Redeemer. Troops have stormed the favela to rid it of drug gangs and clamp down on violence . In the coming days, army soldiers will begin patrolling the virtually treeless, flat area of about two square miles in northern Rio that hugs the main road to the airport and is home to about 130,000 people . A navy tank drives behind a police van carrying scores of police officers holding machine guns . One soldier hides behind a wall as he point his gun towards the street. It was dusk in Rio when troops entered the favela . Navy tanks roll through the favela. The police community pacification unit, known as the UPP, will step in once federal forces have left the area. The UPP will then remain in the shanty town in order to keep peace and control any uprising . A couple walks along as a navy tank storms into the place where they live. The army presence in favelas across Rio has sparked rage across the city. Last week, protestors set fire to a police office in the city . A policeman stands next to a piece of graffiti bearing the words: 'Politicians and the UPP' will die. The UPP is a special community officer group which steps in to keep peace in the favela once government troops have left . One police officer is pictured here holding a man up against a wall while he searches him. Troops took over the favela this afternoon - six weeks before the World Cup . Brazil will host the World Cup from June 14 and has been named host of the 2016 Olympics. The clean-up is an attempt to make Rio a safer place for tourists attending the events . Police wait outside an unknown house in the slum. Security forces will eventually set up permanent posts in Mare as part of the 'pacification' programme that began in 2008 and is meant to secure Rio ahead of the World Cup and also the 2016 summer Olympics . Early evening today the troops stormed the favela. It is unknown how long the operation will last. Once troops leave a 'pacification' force will be introduced into Mare . The BOPE paramilitary police unit have been patrolling streets since dusk. Once they leave a more long-term patrol force will be established in the favela. Police have installed 37 such posts in recent years in an area covering 1.5 million people . Please line up outside a boarded up pharmacy.

"Nigel Farage is set to appear alongside some to the United States' most high-profile conservative politicians at a conference in Washington tomorrow. The Ukip leader will address activists immediately after the darling of the Tea Party movement Sarah Palin. The annual Conservative Political Action Conference is attended by leading Republican politicians as well as gun activists, anti-abortion campaigners and evangelical Christians. Nigel Farage, who has developed a cult following in the States after regular TV appearances on Fox News, will address the annual Conservative Political Action Conference tonight . Visitors to the summit are sometimes handed plastic foetuses by activists to show their opposition to abortion. Tea Party supporters – who favour a dramatic reduction in the size of the State – also walk the halls in uniforms from the 18th-century American Revolutionary War. But the Ukip leader, who has developed a cult following in the States after regular TV appearances on Fox News, defended his decision to appear at the conference. He said: 'There are parts of the American Conservative movement that I get on well with and other parts not so well with. 'We have learned quite a lot from some of them in terms of campaigning techniques, many of which we put into use in Rochester. 'Some of the very hard-line religious stuff is not where I'm going with politics and I often find myself disagreeing about interventionist foreign policies.' Mr Farage is expected to tell the gathered activists that unless they reclaim the Republican Party they 'might have to do a Ukip' and break off.

Former Vice President Dick Cheney, centre, accepts a rifle from National Rifle Association chiefs Kayne Robinson (right) and Wayne LaPierre (left). Mr LaPierre will attend the conference alongside Mr Farage . The Ukip leader has been given a super-star build-up for the annual gathering at the Gaylord National Resort in Maryland, near Washington DC. PR agents promoting the event have described him as a 'political tour de force' who has 'emerged as a serious and viable candidate who can run England in the near future'. Mr Farage will appear after Mrs Palin, the former Alaska governor who rose to prominence after being chosen as Senator John McCain's running mate in the 2008 Presidential race against Barack Obama. The Ukip leader will also rub shoulders with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker - a frontrunner for the Republican Presidential nomination next year - who wants to 'prioritise' the end of universal healthcare introduce by President Obama. Mr Farage will also be joined by Wayne LaPierre, the head of the pro-gun National Rifle Association. Speaking after one of the recent multiple killings in the US, Mr LaPierre said: 'The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.'","Ukip leader will address annual Conservative Political Action Conference .

"Mothers aged 30 to 34 gave birth to more babies than any other age group last year, new figures have revealed today. A maternity services report, published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, said almost a third of babies delivered in 2013-14 had a mother in this age group. Overall, 646,900 babies were born in NHS hospitals in the past year - the smallest number ever recorded since 2006- 07. There was a noticeable reduction in the number of young mothers giving birth, the report said. Women aged 30-34 gave birth to more babies last year than any other age group, new figures show . In 2013-14, mothers aged 15 to 19 years old gave birth to 26,300 babies - a 14 per cent reduction compared to the previous year. Deliveries to mothers aged 20 to 24 were also reduced by 8.6 per cent  to 110,000. The report also revealed the numbers of babies being delivered by C-section has steadily increased since 2011-12, a trend the Royal College of Midwives has described as 'concerning'. More than 26 per cent of babies were born by Caesarean in 2013-14, a 0.6 percentage point increase on 2012-13 and a 1.2 percentage point increase on 2011-12. London hospitals were more likely to deliver babies by C-section than those in other parts of the country. In the capital, almost 29 per cent were delivered this way. And West Yorkshire hospitals had the lowest proportion of C-section births - just 22 per cent. In turn, they had the highest proportion of spontaneous births, where a baby is delivered without the need for forceps, vacuum, or any other instruments. More than 67 per cent of births in West Yorkshire hospitals were born this way, while London hospitals had the lowest proportion of spontaneous deliveries, at nearly 57 per cent. Across the country, nearly 61 per cent of all births were spontaneous. Figures published by the ONS yesterday showed rates of conception for women aged 35 to 39 rose fastest in 2013, compared to all other age groups. The statistics show teenage conceptions have fallen to their lowest rate since records began in 1969 . The figures come a day after statistics from the ONS revealed rates of conception for women aged 35 to 39 rose fastest in 2013, compared to all other age groups. The number of teenage mothers conceiving fell to the lowest level in more than 40 years. Growing numbers of women are giving birth by Caesarean section, a report revealed today. The numbers of babies by C-section has steadily increased since 2011-12, according to Health and Social Care Information Center data. The Royal College of Midwives says the rise is 'concerning' and the major surgical procedure 'should not be undertaken lightly'. The figures show more than 26 per cent of babies were born by Caesarean in 2013-14, a 0.6 percentage point increase on 2012-13 and a 1.2 percentage point increase on 2011-12. London hospitals had the greatest proportion of babies - almost 29 per cent - delivered by C-section. And West Yorkshire hospitals had the lowest proportion of births - almost 22 per cent - delivered by Caesarean. Commenting on the report, Louise Silverton, director for midwifery at The Royal College of Midwives, said: 'We are concerned by yet another increase in the Caesarean section rate, which is steadily climbing. Some are, of course, needed for medical reasons. However, this is a major surgical procedure for mother and baby that should not be undertaken without serious consideration. 'There is increasing evidence about the negative implications for women and their babies of having a Caesarean section. We support NICE recommendations on this issue. These say health professionals should review and discuss this thoroughly with women who want a Caesarean section that is not medically necessary. A decision to have a Caesarean section should not be taken lightly. Experts warned yesterday that a growing number of women are delaying motherhood as they prioritise their careers. Balancing concerns over the cost of raising a child, uncertainty over job security and unstable relationships are increasingly causing women to delay having a baby, they said. They added that while pregnancy and childbirth in later life can present challenges, women should not be pressured into having children before they are ready. Rather, the health service must ensure maternity services are tailored to meet the needs of an increasingly ageing population of expectant mothers. Last year, ONS figures revealed that the average age of first-time mothers had risen above 30 for the first time, increasing by four years since the 1970s. This year's figures revealed the conception rate for women aged 35 to 39 increased to 64.5 conceptions per thousand women - almost doubling since 1990, according to the Office for National Statistics figures. Clare Murphy, director of external affairs at bpas (British Pregnancy Advisory Service) told MailOnline: 'There are many reasons for this, not least the time it takes to achieve financial stability and establish a career. 'Women are often warned about leaving it too late to start trying for a baby, but this really needs to be kept in perspective. 'Pregnancy and childbirth for older women can present particular challenges, but rather than pressuring women into having children earlier than they feel is right for them, we need to ensure maternity services are in place to deliver the care they need.' A spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) said while women must be supported in their decisions about when to plan having a child, they 'need to know how fertility and pregnancy outcomes change with age'. Biologically the optimum childbearing age is between 20 and 35 years old, the RCOG said. But they warn after the age of 35, 'it is increasingly difficult to fall pregnant, and the change of miscarriage rises'. RCOG spokesman, Dr Patrick O'Brien, said: 'The growing trend of women delaying motherhood until their late thirties or early forties is, we believe, an inevitable one, because of the increasing equality in the social, professional, financial and corporate environment that we live in. 'The average age of fatherhood has also been rising. 'It is the role of healthcare professionals, including the RCOG and its members, to ensure that all women are made aware of the potential risks of having pregnancies in later life, so that they have an informed choice when doing so.' It comes as teenage pregnancy rates for women aged 15 to 17 fell to 24.5 conceptions per thousand of the population - the lowest rate since 1969. The growing trend of having children later in life is becoming the norm, as women prioritise their education and careers. And in deciding when to embark on motherhood, financial worries, uncertainty over job security and unstable relationships are increasingly causing women to delay family life, experts said . The figures show a 13 per cent drop in the estimated number of conceptions for women under 18 in 2013, down to 24,306 in 2013 compared with 27,834 in 2012. For the under-16s, there was also a 14 per cent drop in the number of conceptions - an estimate of 4,648 in 2013, compared with 5,432 in 2012. Overall, for women aged under 35 conception rates fell in 2013, compared with the previous year. Teenage pregnancy rates have fallen to their lowest rates since 1969. The latest ONS figures reveal for women aged 15 to 17 fell to 24.5 conceptions per thousand of the population. The figures show a 13 per cent drop in the estimated number of conceptions for women under 18 in 2013, down to 24,306 in 2013 compared with 27,834 in 2012. For the under-16s, there was also a 14 per cent drop in the number of conceptions - an estimate of 4,648 in 2013, compared with 5,432 in 2012. The ONS believed the drop in the number of under-age pregnancies could be explained by several factors, including the improved programmes of sex and relationship education introduced by successive governments. The Government has included the under 18 teenage conception rate as one of its three sexual health indicators in its Public Health Outcomes Framework, and it is one of the national measures of progress on child poverty. Professor Kevin Fenton, national director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England (PHE), said: 'Young people who have the highest rate of unplanned pregnancy and teenage parenthood can be at risk of a range of poor outcomes, such as poor educational achievement, poor physical and mental health, social isolation and poverty, so it is vital this downward trend is continued.' He said one of PHE's seven national priorities is 'ensuring every child has the best start in life'. Public health experts hailed the fall in teenage conception rates, adding it proves 'young people's sexual health can be improved if they receive the right support'. In 2013, overall conceptions in women of all ages fell slightly, with an estimated 872,849 conceptions compared with 884,748 in 2012 - a decrease of 1.3 per cent. Conception estimates include all pregnancies that lead to a maternity leading to birth or stillbirth, or an abortion. Teenage pregnancy rates and early motherhood is significant, as it is linked to poor educational achievement, poor physical and mental health, social isolation, poverty and related factors, the ONS note. The ONS believed the drop in the number of under-age pregnancies could be explained by several factors, including the improved programmes of sex and relationship education introduced by successive governments. Its report also stated that it could be due to a 'shift in aspirations of young women towards education' or the 'perception of stigma associated with being a teenage mother'. The Government has included the under 18 teenage conception rate as one of its three sexual health indicators in its Public Health Outcomes Framework, and it is one of the national measures of progress on child poverty. Professor Kevin Fenton, national director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England (PHE), welcomed the fall in teenage conception rates. He said: 'Young people who have the highest rate of unplanned pregnancy and teenage parenthood can be at risk of a range of poor outcomes, such as poor educational achievement, poor physical and mental health, social isolation and poverty, so it is vital this downward trend is continued.' He said one of PHE's seven national priorities is 'ensuring every child has the best start in life', adding the authority are committed to working with local government to further reduce teenage conception rates 'because we know this is generally better for both parents and children'. Health experts have hailed the fall in teenage conceptions, noting early motherhood increases a teenage girls' risk of poor educational achievement, poor physical and mental health, social isolation and poverty .","In 2013-14, women aged 30-34 gave birth to more babies than other groups .

Mayer — the 19th century inventor who sold his sugar cookie recipe to Nabisco for their 'Nilla' wafers  - has been listed for sale at $2.3 million. Mayer, who died in 1918, left the home to his two daughters, Paula and Emilie, who never married and both lived until they were over 100-years-old, refusing to leave two certain rooms of the 10-bedroom house. In this regard, the manor has become ideal for photoshoots, providing a setting that is rustic and dilapidated but also trapped-in-time, with many of the rooms untouched for decades. Haunted?: Gustav Manor in Staten Island is, according to local folklore, still inhabited by the spirits of former owner, inventor Gustav A. Mayer, and his daughters, all of whom died in the mansion . Historic: The 10-bedroom manor measures at 7,700-square-foot and has been listed for $2.3 million . However legend has it the spirits of Gustav and his two daughters continue to roam the halls. The house, built in 1855, was put up for sale in June for $1.79 million. However the listing was then removed. It has now reappeared for $2.3 million, according to Top Ten Real Estate Deals. However a $520,000 allowance for exterior restoration and another $50,000 for interior refurbishment is being offered to the buyer, bringing the final price to $1.74 million. After buying the house from original owner David R. Ryers in the 1890s, Mayer transformed the 7,700-square-foot home so that it allowed him to live and workshop his inventions. Besides his famous cookie recipe, he also made many successful molds for the likes of Vienna Roll, Cigaretta, Carlsbad, Fancy Dessert and Virginia Sugar. Fashion focus: The home has been the setting for countless fashion shoots over the years . Strike a pose: Thanks to its history, look and proximity to Manhattan, the manor is often rented out by magazines and fashion houses . Hitchcockian: Here two models pose for a Cosmopolitan shoot themed as an Alfred Hitchcock movie . Mayer is also said to have developed 'a birch beer, patented a room humidifier and marketed a system of pre-formed letters for use on store signs. He also designed and manufactured sparkling reflectors for use as Christmas tree ornaments,' according to The Staten Island Advocate. The sale however is likely to put an end to the myriad of fashion shoots the house and its gardens have witnessed over the last few years. The Fault In Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort shot a high fashion feature on the grounds for Elle magazine, sitting in a tree out back with a model. Mary Kate Olsen has  appeared in a Bohemian-themed shoot there for Harper's Bazaar. Amber Heard has also shot a profile for V magazine inside the house. Ornate: The house was first built in 1855 and has many of its original features . Dilapidated: Because some parts of the manor are so outdated, the real estate is offering internal and external renovation allowances for the new owners . Classic: The house has a distinct Victorian look and feel, including hand-painted drawings on the walls . The proximity to Manhattan makes the site even more popular. However that doesn't make it an easy place to work. Photographer Tom Corbett, who shot a Hitchcock-inspire piece for Cosmopolitan called 'Dial F for Fashion', said he was scared to enter the house. 'When I first showed up, I almost didn’t go in,' Corbett told The New York Times. “I thought I was in the wrong place, but it turned out to be this total gem.” The three-level house is located at 2475 Richmond Rd. in Staten Island.

"Beatrice Nokes, pictured, is suspected of grooming three young women to sell their bodies for sex . The daughter of two respected solicitors is accused of running an upmarket vice ring with a Scotland Yard detective. Beatrice Nokes, 21, faces claims she incited a ring of prostitutes operating out of properties in Central London. The University College London chemistry student is suspected of grooming three young women to sell their bodies for sex. She is accused of running the vice ring in the capital last year with 37-year-old Met police officer Daniel Williams. He faces several further offences including voyeurism and hiding the profits of their activities in socks stuffed up the chimney of his home. It is understood he is accused of committing the crimes while on and off-duty, using a tablet computer to co-ordinate illicit liaisons while working. Nokes, a keen horsewoman, artist and charity fundraiser, is the daughter of two highly experienced legal professionals. Her father, Jonathan Nokes, 66, is a partner at respected law firm Anthony Gold where he specialises in commercial property law. Her mother, Ceinwen Rowles, 59, specialises in education law, discrimination and complaints and is taking a case to the European Court of Human Rights. They both accompanied her to Westminster Magistrates’ Court when she went before a judge for the first time last month. Yesterday, she appeared in the dock alongside Williams at Southwark Crown Court where their cases were formally joined. The pair, who sat at either end of the dock and did not speak or look at each other, spoke only to confirm their identities. The both face three charges of ‘causing or inciting’ prostitution ‘in the expectation of gain’ in September and October last year. Beatrice Nokes (pictured at Southwark Crown Court) is facing claims she incited a London prostitute ring . Nokes is accused of running the vice ring in the capital last year with 37-year-old Met police officer Daniel Williams who was based at Tooting police station in Wandsworth, South West London (pictured) before he was suspended from duty . Williams faces seven further charges including controlling prostitution for gain in the 10 months up until his arrest by anti-corruption colleagues on October 8. The detective constable, who is suspended from duty, was based at Tooting police station in Wandsworth, South West London. He is accused of two counts of misconduct in a public office, firstly by running the prostitution ring and secondly by using police computers to check clients. A further charge alleges he concealed a ‘large quantity of cash’ by stuffing it in socks and hiding it in the chimney of his Putney home. Several weeks after he was first arrested Williams was also accused of using high-tech hidden equipment to spy on unsuspecting women hotel guests . He is said to have watched the victims at the Jury’s Inn in Milton Keynes and The Mandolay Hotel, Guildford, Surrey, between January and October last year. Williams also faces charges of voyeurism after he was accused of using high-tech hidden equipment to spy on unsuspecting women hotel guests at the Jury’s Inn in Milton Keynes (left) and The Mandolay Hotel, Guildford, Surrey (right) The court heard Williams, who wore a navy suit and purple tie, has been refused legal aid or financial support from the Police Federation. His barrister Paul Spreadborough said he was working for free for the detective until the legal funding is sorted out. ‘The defendant did the alleged offences while acting as a police officer and faces charges of misconduct in a public office,’ he said. ‘It is to that end that those instructing me were most surprised that the Police Federation have refused his funding on the basis it had nothing to do with police work.’ Williams, of Putney, South West London, and Nokes, of Islington, North London, were both released on conditional bail. They are expected to go on trial later this year. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Beatrice Nokes allegedly ran a prostitute ring in Central London last year .

"A Scottish mansion has sold for £4million in what is thought to have been the biggest sale north of the border since the financial crash. With nine bedrooms, a cinema room, gym and seven-acre garden, Hillwood House has been trumpeted as a sign of Scotland's recovery, though it still costs the same as a three-bed flat in London's South Kensington. The house with its own mock-turret on the slopes of Corstorphine Hill, Edinburgh, was once home to the MacKinnon family, who owned the rights to Drambuie for a century before selling the alcohol brand in September. Plush: Hillwood House in Edinburgh has sold for £4million, making it what is believed to be Scotland's biggest post-crash property sale . Lavish: The kitchen of the luxury home, which was built in the late 1800s and housed the family behind the Drambuie alcohol brand . Room with a view: Property analysts say Scotland's market is creeping up to the level it attained in 2007, but it is not there yet . Big: But the nine-bedroom mansion still costs less than a three-bedroom apartment in London's district of South Kensington . The sprawling home has sold for almost £1million more than Scotland's previous post-crash record holder, a mansion in one of Aberdeen's most exclusive streets which fetched £3million last year. And its  price is close to that fetched by Scotland's most expensive home ever sold - Seton Castle in Longniddry, East Lothian, which dotcom millionaires Stephen Leach and Heather Luscombe bought for £5million just before the crash in 2007. Built in 1872 a few miles from the city centre, Hillwood House was restored before going on sale last year and includes period features and a private tennis court. It is perhaps best-known for its links to Scottish industry, having been home to the MacKinnon family which owned the Drambuie blend of whisky, honey, herbs and spices for more than 100 years. Legend claimed Bonnie Prince Charlie handed the recipe to a Captain John MacKinnon (no relation) for helping him escape to the Isle of Skye after defeat at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. Dreaming of summer: The house backs on to seven acres of private garden and has its own tennis court. The buyer's identity is unknown . Relax: Its price is close to that fetched by Scotland's most expensive home ever sold - Seton Castle in Longniddry, East Lothian . Living room: Sales of £1million-plus homes in Scotland are on the rise, with 146 properties fetching seven figures last year . It was then reportedly passed to hotel owner John Ross in 1873, after which he began serving it to his guests on the Isle of Skye. The name is said to have come from the Gaelic 'an dram buidheach', meaning 'the drink that satisfies'. In the early 20th Century the recipe's rights were sold to Malcolm MacKinnon, no relation to the Captain who originally obtained it. With a few cases of the drink bottled in Edinburgh, he founded an empire which has now made Drambuie one of Britain's most popular spirits. Hillwood House was still the Scottish base of Drambuie until around a decade ago, but the brand was sold by the MacKinnon family in September last year to the makers of rival spirit Glenfiddich. Sales of £1million-plus homes in Scotland are on the rise, and yesterday it emerged 146 properties fetched seven figures last year - up from 137 in 2013. Bathroom: The grand house's facilities have the feel of a hotel sauna - useful for relaxing after a match on its private tennis court . Cinema room: The house has the sort of facilities which would normally be reserved for the 'iceberg basements' of the mega-rich . Keeping fit: The house's private gym. One estate agent claimed. 'Confidence has returned. People (buyers) act by following each other' Alan Fraser, of the Edinburgh-based Investment Property Agency, claimed sales such as Hillwood House will become more prevalent over the next few years. 'Confidence has returned,' he said. 'People act by following each other. After seven years of property recession people are realising they need to get on with their lives.' Blair Stewart, a partner at Strutt & Parker, which sold the house, declined to comment on the sale or confirm the price. But he said 66 sales in excess of £1million were recorded in Edinburgh last year. '2014's figures were slightly up on the previous three years but still only represents 52 per cent of the total sales at the peak of the market in 2007,' he added. 'Transactions in this sector are still a long way off the boom years of 2007/2008.' Eat in style: Despite its modern interiors, there are some rooms in the now-sold house which have been kept to a period effect . Gardens: The house is on the side of Corstorphine Hill, Edinburgh, and is a few miles from the city centre .

"Marie Holmes first day as a multi-millionaire started off as normally as possible - making breakfast for her four kids and aimlessly checking Facebook. It was when she was scrolling through her feed though that life changed forever. A friend posted the winning numbers to the $564million Powerball, so 26-year-old Holmes went and fetched her tickets. When she noticed that all the numbers matched she started screaming so loud that her three daughters and son thought something was wrong. 'I started screaming and stuff and my kids ran away from me and said I scared them...they ran into the next room,' Ms Holmes said on Good Morning America on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Powerball winnter Marie Holmes appeared on Good Morning America on Tuesday and discussed the moment she realized she won $188million . Ms Holmes was cooking breakfast for her children and reading Facebook when she saw a post with the winning numbers, and saw that one of her tickets matched . Ms Holmes says she then called her mother and told her to come over, saying: 'I think I got the matching numbers'. She fave her mother $15 to buy five tickets on the way to church, and later bought five more. When her mother arrived, they checked the numbers again and this time Ms Holmes had to run outside to release her utter excitement. Ms Holmes accepted a check for a lump-sum payment $188million on Monday in a press conference in her home state of North Carolina. But even though her newfound fortune is in the bank, the reality of her life as a millionaire still hasn't sunk in. 'I still don't believe it,' she told GMA. 'I don't know when I'm actually going to believe it.' Ms Holmes, a single mother, plans to spend her money getting her mother a new house, fixing up her gradmother's house and setting up college funds for her children. But she insists she won't spoil the kids. 'They're not going to get everything they want,' she said. 'They're going to learn. It's a learning process.' Ms Holmes accepted a $188million lump-sum payment at a press conference in North Carolina on Monday . She plans to use the money to buy a new house for her mother, fix up her grandmother's house and set up a college fund for her children . While she plans to spend some of the money travelling, Ms Holmes is also eager to get back in the classroom and finish her education. She plans to study nursing. Holmes, one of three winners of the historic $564million jackpot, announced her winnings to a local news station two weeks ago. Holmes and her family live in a trailer in Shallotte, North Carolina — just north of South Carolina on the coast. She used to work at McDonald's and Walmart before quitting to take care of her children. Her four children, Brayden, Charisma, Andrea and Ebony, are aged from nine months to seven years old. Brayden is believed to suffer from cerebral palsy. Holmes sacrificed her education to care for her four children and took minimum wage jobs to provide for her family. With little or no help from the fathers of her four young children, she has struggled financially for most of her adult life. Ms Holmes is a single-mother to four children - three daughters and a son ages 9-months to 7-years-old . It's beleived that Ms Holmes son has cerebral palsey. She intends to donate to a foundation that researches the disease . Holmes has also seen her own father repeatedly jailed and her favorite cousin shot and left paralyzed after a home invasion. Family members  describe Holmes as a loving mother who always put her children first. 'Marie is very grounded and she will know what to do with all that money,' said her uncle William Bryant. 'I'm sure she will want to buy a new home for herself and her kids, but I can't see any extravagant purchases. She's a nice girl who loves her family and loves her church.' Holmes has little contact with the two fathers of her four children. The three eldest are with her former high school sweetheart who now lives in California. Her youngest child is with a local man but friends say he is not involved in his daughter's life. Lottery officials said her winning ticket was sold at a convenience store in Shallotte. It is the fourth time that a North Carolina ticket has claimed a Powerball jackpot. In North Carolina, a winner has 180 days from the drawing to claim the prize. The winning numbers were: 11, 13, 25, 39, 54 and the Powerball 19. Holmes's winning line was the fourth of the 'quick picks'. The odds of winning the Powerball are one in 175million. The gas station she bought the ticket at will get $50,000 as a retailer incentive award. Another ticket-holder from the February 11 drawing in Puerto Rico has elected to remain anonymous, while the owner of a winning ticket sold in Texas has not yet come forward. The Texas Lottery posted on Twitter that one of the winning tickets was sold at Appletree Food Mart in Princeton, a city about 40 miles north of Dallas. This is the trailer where Ms Holmes lives with her four children - but odds are she'll be upgrading soon . She used to work at McDonald's and Walmart before quitting to take care of her children. It had been nearly a year since a Powerball prize reached the giant number people have come to expect recently. That was last February, when someone won $425.3million. The February 11 jackpot was the third-largest in Powerball history and the fifth-largest U.S. lottery prize. The last time a Powerball jackpot climbed so high was May 2013, when a Florida ticket won a $590.5million prize. The largest payout in U.S. history was to three ticketholders in the Mega Millions game, the other national lottery drawing. That was a $656million prize won in March 2012 by players in Kansas, Illinois and Maryland. In 2012, state officials who run Powerball and Mega Millions changed ticket prices and lowered the odds of winning jackpots in hopes the moves would increase the number of huge prizes and draw more players. The new rules worked, causing jackpots to repeatedly climb to record levels. More than half of the top 10 U.S. jackpots have been reached in the past couple of years.","Mother-of-four Marie Holmes is one of  three winners of the recent $564million jackpot .

"A teacher from Connecticut has been accused of carrying on inappropriate relationships with two teenage students - and sexually assaulting one in the high school where she works. Allison J. Marchese, 37, from Madison turned herself into police on charges of second-degree sexual assault and impairing the morals of a minor, police and school officials said. Police say they discovered inappropriate text messages - as well as sexy selfies of herself wearing only a thong and a bra. Mrs Marchese is now on paid leaving pending the outcome of an internal investigation. Harmless? This 'selfie' of Marchese 'dressed in only thong style underwear with her breast covered and her midriff exposed' was sent to a student . After investigating for almost five weeks, police were able to get all of the information they needed; including talking to people at the Daniel Hand High School, reviewing phone records, and locating some inappropriate pictures that were exchanged between the teacher and the student.​ . Pending: Marchese, 37, who has worked at the school district for 12 years and is a mother of two children, is on paid leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation . There were winking, smiling emoticons, flirtations, sexual hints and a 'selfie' of Mrs Marchese 'dressed in only thong style underwear with her breast covered and her midriff exposed,' according to police. The indiscretion was taking place directly under the nose of her husband, Robert Marchese, 39, who not only taught at the same school but also in the same English department. Court records show that she struck up relationships with two teenage boys at the school and it wasn't long before rumors started circulating in classrooms. In the arrest warrant affidavit, a 17-year-old student told police he received a selfie of Marchese scantily dressed. In her defense, the affidavit says Mrs Marchese said she sent the photo to her husband. In one instance, Mrs Marchese messaged the 17-year-old through Instagram to come to her classroom. The teen excused himself from a different class by pretending he needed the bathroom and headed to Room 347 where Mrs Marchese was allegedly waiting. 'Once in the room, they got into each other's personal space and started to 'hook up' which he described as kissing each other and she then started touching him 'downtown,'' the affidavit said. Fearing it was 'not safe,' Marchese 'locked the classroom door and closed the blinds.' She then performed a sex act on him, the affidavit said. After the summer break ended in September 2014, the student wanted to cool the relationship off but Mrs Maechese was addicted as did not want their encounters to stop. She sent him a confusing Instagram message that said, 'I know when to stop, I know when to move on, but I know is different from I can,' the affidavit said. Desperate to put an end to the encounters, the teenager then came up with a plan to blackmail Marchese, telling her that he would stay silent about their relationship if she gave him $200. In response, the teacher let him know that her father had 'Mafia ties' who would make sure he 'would never play football again,' if he told anyone. The student finally gave in and reported the allegations to staff at the school. The police were contacted and the English teacher was arrested on January 7 WTNH-TV reports. Media message: At one point Marchese messaged the teen through Instagram to come to her classroom. The teen told the teacher whose class he was in at the time he had to use the bathroom and went to see Marchese . When police went to the school to look into the allegations they discovered that there were others with whom the teacher had behaved inappropriately with. Madison police investigators also interviewed 15-year-old student who claimed that he too had a relationship with Mrs Marchese, that began when he was 14. Like the 17-year-old, much of the communication took place through Instagram. The student told investigators that Mrs Marchese had texted him to say that she could not concentrate on teaching her own class because he he was so attractive. The younger teen said Marchese messaged him 'nonstop' the first week of summer vacation, including long messages expressing her feelings and trying to make him feel badly for not responding.​ . The English teacher at Daniel Hand High School, Marchese is now on paid leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation. Playing with fire: Madison police began investigating Marchese in early January after the 17-year-old went to the principal . Silent: Nobody has been at home to speak to the press in recent days to discuss the allegations . 'I find the alleged conduct of this teacher vile and disgusting,' Superintendent of Schools Thomas R. Scarice said. 'The bond of trust between a professional educator and a student is fragile and precious. The violation of this bond is nothing less than reprehensible.' Broken down: Robert Marchese, 39, who also teaches English at Daniel Hand has now filed for divorce against his wife. He is looking after their two children . Education officials have said they will take 'the 'most aggressive actions possible to see to it that any individual who abuses theirs bond is removed from the profession and brought to justice.' Under state law, second-degree sexual assault is a felony that carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000. If the victim is under 16 years of age, the maximum sentence is 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $20,000. Mrs Marchese had worked in the school district for 12 years and was a well regarded teacher. The school has put in place support services to help students who may need some support. Mrs Marchese's husband, Rob, 39, also teaches at the school. During an interview with Madison police in January, Robert Marchese told investigators that his wife had recently become obsessed with 'social media and working out.' He said his wife told him she was having an 'inappropriate relationship' with the 15-year-old, communicating with him in 'sexually explicit ways,' and that she 'admitted having oral sex' with the 17-year-old, the affidavit said. He also turned over tape recordings of a conversation he had with his wife in which she admitted those things, according to the affidavit. The couple have since filed for divorce.","Teacher Allison Marchese, 37, pleaded not guilty to sexual assault charges .

"Hundreds of battle-weary troops flying home from Afghanistan endured a 48-hour delay at a sweltering Middle East airbase because of a farcical row over an aircraft's damaged tyre. Box-ticking military chiefs refused to allow the RAF Voyager's crew to swap a damaged tyre with one from a nearby international airport - because it would breach a £10.5billion private-finance deal, passengers claimed they were told. Instead, top brass sent a team with a new wheel on a 3,400-mile trip from the UK to the Gulf. Grounded: A RAF Voyager transporter aircraft flying British troops home from Afghanistan was delayed for 48 hours because of a row over replacing its spare tyre (file picture) It meant more than 250 soldiers desperate . to see their families after six months fighting the Taliban were forced . to twiddle their thumbs at the base until the replacement arrived. Some servicemen were even forced to cancel their eagerly-awaited summer holidays because of the hold-up. The fiasco happened on July 16 as the . troops, including 100 members of the Royal Artillery, travelled from . Kandahar to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, via the United Arab . Emirates. As they prepared to depart Al Minhad Air Base, the Voyager was suddenly forced to abort take-off after striking a bird. A check of the stricken £150million transport plane revealed the collision had punctured a tyre - which was replaced with a spare carried on board. However, during the emergency landing a second tyre was damaged and needed to be replaced before the plane could take off. The . disgruntled troops - already three days late returning to Britain . because of a broken-down plane in Afghanistan - were herded into huts . where temperatures touched a stifling 42C. Because . the Voyagers are militarised versions of the Airbus A330-200 passenger . jets, the RAF crew tried to source a new tyre from an international . airport in Dubai. Astonishingly, . senior military officers in the UK refused permission. Passengers were . told this was because it would invalidate the aircraft's warranty under a . private-finance project signed with the AirTanker consortium in 2008 - . costing the Ministry of Defence extra money. The . deal, where the Government repays the cost of planes over 27 years, . apparently states all repairs must be carried out by engineers based in the UK. However, today, the MoD denied that the contract stated it has to use its own engineers. One soldier said: 'It was an absolute disgrace. The guys were furious. We were fobbed off with one excuse after another. 'It . was only a flat tyre. The aircrew said it would have taken an hour to . change and yet it ended up taking two days. There was almost a . mini-riot.' Farcical: More than 250 soldiers had flown from Kandahar base (pictured) but were left stranded in the Middle East until a replacement wheel could be flown out from Britain . One of the reasons the RAF selected the A330-200 Airbus was because spare parts were available all around the world. The soldier told the Mail: 'We were told that the aircrew we trying to source a tyre locally and we should be back in the air in a few hours. 'Then the message came through that the RAF engineer chain of command had refused permission, claiming it could invalidate the warranty. 'There was a real protest. A lot of people were very frustrated, very angry. 'Some of the guys on board were returning to the UK to go on family holidays and were going to miss them. 'The story kept changing with every briefing we were given. One minute we were going to get spare tyres locally and the next we weren't. 'No one could believe it. What is the point of having a strategic aircraft which can only be repaired in the UK. It's an absolute nonsense.' The incident is the latest problem to hit the Voyagers, which were acquired by the previous Government for air-to-air refuelling and transporting troops. Three years ago the MoD's deal to buy the planes from AirTanker was condemned as 'not value for money' by MPs on the Commons' Public Accounts Committee. And last year it emerged that the planes were failing to refuel RAF fighter jets. Technicians had to work out how to stop leaks that occurred when the pipes of the giant Voyagers were attached mid-flight to RAF Tornados to fill them up at the rate of 5,000 litres a minute. The MoD was also blasted by the National Audit Office, Britain's spending watchdog, for 'astonishing failures' because the planes cannot be flown in warzones as they lack proper protection. An MoD spokesman said: 'We understand how much the chance to see loved ones means to our personnel and that is why any leave lost will be given back in line with standard policy. 'While we of course try to get service personnel home as quickly as possible, unforeseen circumstances can cause delays and safety has to be a priority.

"A British soldier who suffered life-changing injuries while serving in Afghanistan after being hit by a roadside bomb has been found dead at his home in Manchester. Private Bradley Paul, 23, was heading up a supply patrol in Helmand Province in 2012 when an explosion severed an artery in his neck and left him with multiple fractures. He was airlifted back to the UK and spent 12 months recovering, but also began fighting an 'internal struggle' to come to terms with his injuries, his commanding officer Captain Chris Middleton said. Private Bradley Paul, 23, had an artery in his neck severed and sustained several fractures after being hit with an IED while serving in Afghanistan, and was medically discharged from the Army a year later . Private Paul, who served with the 1st Battalion, The Mercian Regiment, was medically discharged from the Army last year, and  found dead at home in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, last week. Police say he was found with a neck injury and the death is not being treated as suspicious. Private Paul's family say they are now working to raise awareness of mental health issues facing former soldiers, and are appealing for donations to fund a full military funeral. They have so far raised £8,000, and say they have been overwhelmed by messages of support. In a message posted on the Gofundme website, Private Paul’s mother, Sam Paul, said that her son would be ‘smiling down’ if he could see the outpouring of emotion. After being wounded Mr Bradley was flown to the UK where he spent 12 months recovering. Despite his progress, he was found dead at his home in Manchester with a neck injury . Captain Chris Middleton, who was Private Paul's commanding officer during his time in Helmand, said he lost his battle with an 'internal struggle' to come to terms with his injuries (Private Paul pictured right) She said: 'I’m overwhelmed b . y all the donations and messages on this page. Thank you so much every one of you on behalf of Brad’s family. 'I know Brad will be smiling down on you all to see how loved he is. Thank you again and much love to you all.' His aunt, Lauraine Cover, thanked Private Paul’s commanding officer in Afghanistan, Captain Chris Middleton, for launching the appeal. She added: 'Thanks to all the caring, generous people who have donated, you are all amazing.'

"Isis terrorists have blown up the Mosul Public Library, sending 10,000 books and more than 700 rare manuscripts up in flames. Leading members of Mosul society reportedly tried to stop the fanatics destroying the building, but failed. The director of the library, Ghanim al-Ta'an, said that the extremists used homemade bombs in the attack, which took place on Sunday. Demonstrators chant pro-Islamic State group slogans as they carry the group's flags in front of the provincial government headquarters in Mosul. Members of the terrorist group have destroyed the city's public library . Iraqis look at books on al-Mutanabi Street, home to the city's book market in central Baghdad. Iraq is home to a great many culturally significant books and manuscripts . He told Middle Eastern website Geran: 'ISIS militants bombed the Mosul Public Library. They used improvised explosive devices.' Presumed destroyed are the Central Library's collection of Iraqi newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire and book collections contributed by around 100 of Mosul's establishment families. Mosul blogger Rayan al-Hadidi, according to The Fiscal Times, said: 'Nine hundred years ago, the books of the Arab philosopher Averroes were collected before his eyes... and burned. One of his students started crying while witnessing the burning. Averroes told him... the ideas have wings... but I cry today over our situation.' Isis first invaded the Central Library in January. Residents say the extremists smashed the locks that had protected the biggest repository of learning in the northern Iraq town, and loaded around 2,000 books — including children's stories, poetry, philosophy and tomes on sports, health, culture and science — into six pickup trucks. They left only Islamic texts. 'These books promote infidelity and call for disobeying Allah. So they will be burned,' a bearded militant in traditional Afghani two-piece clothing told residents, according to one man living nearby who spoke to The Associated Press. The man, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation, said the Islamic State group official made his impromptu address as others stuffed books into empty flour bags. Presumed destroyed are the Central Library's collection of Iraqi newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire and book collections contributed by around 100 of Mosul's establishment families . Since the Islamic State group seized a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria, they have sought to purge society of everything that doesn't conform to their violent interpretation of Islam. They already have destroyed many archaeological relics, deeming them pagan, and even Islamic sites considered idolatrous. Increasingly books are in the firing line. Mosul, the biggest city in the Islamic State group's self-declared caliphate, boasts a relatively educated, diverse population that seeks to preserve its heritage sites and libraries. In the chaos that followed the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein, residents near the Central Library hid some of its centuries-old manuscripts in their own homes to prevent their theft or destruction by looters. But this time, the Islamic State group has made the penalty for such actions death. A University of Mosul history professor, who spoke on condition he not be named because of his fear of the Islamic State group, said the extremists started wrecking the collections of other public libraries in December. He reported particularly heavy damage to the archives of a Sunni Muslim library, the library of the 265-year-old Latin Church and Monastery of the Dominican Fathers and the Mosul Museum Library with works dating back to 5000 BC.","Extremists used improvised explosive devices to blow up Mosul library .

"Connor Watts was at an office leaving party when he got drunk and passed out on his train home . A teenage insurance worker had to call police to get rescued after he passed out in a train toilet on a drunken night out and woke up in a deserted depot. Connor Watts, 19, had gone for drinks at an after work leaving party on Thursday before taking his normal route from London Cannon Street to his home in Gillingham, Kent, at around 11.30pm. But on the journey back he started to feel ill and went to the train toilets to be sick where he ended up passing out. After more than two hours he woke up and went back to his seat in the carriage where he sat for about 20 minutes before realising he was the only person on the train and it wasn't moving. Mr Watts was due to change trains at Dartford, Kent, to meet his connecting train to Gillingham, but because he had been in the toilet he missed it and ended up locked in the train at Dartford's depot. The teenager, who is currently doing temp work at Howden Insurance Brokers, said: 'There was quite a big group of us that had gone out for a leaving do to a bar called Agenda. 'I'd had quite a long day and had been up since 5.30am for work. I was also drinking on empty stomach, which wasn't a good idea. 'I remember getting the 11.40pm train and going into Tesco to buy a spicy wrap, but I didn't realise it was so spicy so I went to the toilet on the train and then I was sick and must have passed out. 'I came round but didn't realise I'd passed out so I sat on a seat and I was still feeling a bit ill. I wasn't really paying attention and sat there for about 20 minutes and then I realised we weren't moving and I was the only one on the train.' He explained that he looked outside and although it was dark he could see other trains parked up and worked out he was in a depot. He posted on Twitter the next morning about his night out, telling his 489 followers that he woke up 'trapped on a train' He explained that when he woke the train lighting and heating was still on and it took him 20 minutes to realise it wasn't moving anywhere. He was left with a £40 taxi bill to get back to his home in Gillingham . A picture of the depot looking down the side of the train (left) that Mr Watts took as he got off the train . 'The train I was on still had its lights on and the heating on so I think that's why it took me a while to realise. 'When I tried the door it was locked so I called the police and just said I was stuck on the train. They sent someone who works there to come and let me off. 'He found it quite funny and was laughing and said something like 'at least you've got a story to tell everyone tomorrow'. 'He said they normally check the train but I think it was because I was in the toilet, but they should check them really. It could have been a different story.' The Southeastern rail worker let him out a side gate at the depot and Mr Watts, who lives with his mother, walked back to the train station where he made attempts to call a taxi. 'I knew that most people would be asleep so I didn't bother ringing my mum and the people I had been out with all live in London so I tried calling a taxi. 'It took me a while to eventually get one and it cost me £40 to get home. I didn't get back until 4am and luckily I had booked the next day off otherwise I would have been up again at 5.30am.' Mr Watts said this is the first time something like is ever happened but didn't feel embarrassed by the situation and decided to share what happened on his Twitter page. A spokesperson from the British Transport Police said: 'We were contacted at around 2.15am on Friday, 20 February, by a passenger who had fallen asleep on a train and woken up in a depot in Dartford. 'Officers contacted colleagues from Southeastern, who attended the depot and escorted the man from the train.' They added that it is quite rare for police to get a call of this nature unless a crime has been committed but that they were happy to help in this situation. Connor Watts, left, on a recent night out with friends, says this is the first time anything like this has happened to him. He had fortunately booked the next day off work after getting home at 4am . Michelle Ulyatt, from Southeastern Railway, said: 'Our control centre received a call from British Transport Police in the early hours of Friday 20 February to advise that a passenger was still on board one of our trains at Dartford sidings. 'We contacted the passenger to reassure him and advise that a member of staff was on the way to unlock the train and assist him. Our station team escorted him from the train. 'Our station staff check all trains that terminate at Dartford station before they proceed to the sidings or run to the depot at the close of service. 'We are currently investigating why we did not discover the passenger on board on this occasion and will put in place learning points required as a result of this incident.' This map shows the route that Connor Watts should have taken, starting at London Cannon Street Station and ending at Gillingham in Kent, but after passing out in the toilet he ended up at Dartford depot station . The depot is about a five minute walk from Dartford Station, where Mr Watts had to walk down a road, past a Wickes store, across a bridge and back to the station where he waited for a taxi to take him home .","Connor Watts, 19, had gone for drinks with colleagues for after work party .

"Jill Elizabeth Evans, 54, a former head teacher, allegedly allowed a caretaker to supervise a primary school class while the teacher had a haircut . A respected primary school head allowed a caretaker to supervise a class while the teacher had a haircut, a disciplinary hearing has been told. Jill Elizabeth Evans allegedly permitted the professional hairdresser to come to Heolgerrig Primary School in Merthyr Tydfil during school hours to cut staff members' hair. On one occasion, the school caretaker was left in charge of the class for 20 minutes while the teacher made a trip to the makeshift salon. Mrs Evans, a teacher for more than 20 years, also allegedly encouraged pupils to disrupt supply teachers' lessons and employed her future daughter-in-law in a role that had not been advertised, the hearing heard. The 54-year-old is also accused of bullying eight members of staff and flouting health and safety rules, which are said to have put pupils at risk. Mrs Evans denies all nine charges of 'unacceptable behaviour', which relate to her time as head teacher between 2007 and 2010. Yvonne Mahoney, who worked as a Learning Support Assistant (LSA) at Heolgerrig during the period of the alleged misconduct, told the hearing: 'Haircuts always extended into classroom time. 'Classes were left unsupervised from qualified staff.' Presenting the allegations, Martin Jones told the General Teaching Council that another charge related to Mrs Evans allegedly allowing children to play football around building work. She is also alleged to have misused around £1,500 of grant funding that had been attained to pay for a 'Success Maker' education package, which would buy support software for staff. But, in his opening remarks, Gwilym Roberts-Harry, who represents Mrs Evans, said that all witnesses in the case 'had a grudge to bear' against his client. He said that 'ulterior motives were going on' against Mrs Evans, who he said had been recognised in a number of Estyn and HMI school inspections. Mrs Mahoney told the hearing how Mrs Evans 'wanted to control everyone and everything' and would often take away a teacher's preparation, planning and assessment entitlement, time used for members of staff to catch up with marking and lesson planning. The teacher worked at Heolgerrig Primary School (pictured) in Merthyr Tydfil between 2007 and 2010 . Mrs Mahoney said: 'If she (Evans) had an issue with a member of staff she, would change their PPA timetable to cause a nuisance for them. She told me that.' She also alleged that Mrs Evans would encourage pupils to 'play-up' and be disruptive in front of supply teachers they did not like. 'This was a common theme for Jill,' Mrs Mahoney said. 'She would encourage this disrespect for supply teachers, to see how the supply teachers would handle it.' Mrs Mahoney was asked whether she knew that a classroom assistant appointed in 2009 was in a relationship with Mrs Evans' son - a fact Mrs Evans claims to have been unaware of. Mrs Mahoney said: 'They were definitely in a relationship, and got engaged either just before or just after she started at the school. Jill told me herself.' She said that the role had not been advertised. The hearing in Cardiff continues.

"Another former model has come out accusing beleaguered comedian Bill Cosby of plying her with alcohol and sexually assaulting her more than three decades ago. Heidi Thomas, a 54-year-old music teacher from Colorado and a married mother of three daughters, this week added her voice to a chorus of allegations against the comic. More than a dozen women have publicly accused Cosby, 77, of sexual misconduct in recent months, many of them claiming that America's beloved TV dad took advantage of them while they were intoxicated. Cosby and his attorney have staunchly and repeatedly denied all the allegations. Scroll down for video . One more accuser: Heidi Thomas (left), a married mother of three from Colorado, claims that Bill Cosby (right) sexually assaulted her in 1984 when she came out to Reno to get an acting lesson from him . Lawyer Martin Singer said in a statement to CNN that it defies common sense that 'so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years.' In 1984, Heidi Thomas, nee Johnson, was a 24-year-old model from Denver, Colorado, who was dreaming of a career in acting. Thomas was being represented  by the city's top modelling agency, JF Images, but by 1984 she was questioning whether or not she wanted to stay in the business. Then one day in the spring of 1984, she got a call from an agent who told her that a famous entertainer was searching for young talent to mentor. Thomas said that Annie Maloney, of JF Images, instructed her to travel to Reno, Nevada, where she was supposed to meet with Bill Cosby, who allegedly had expressed interest in becoming her acting coach. Years of silence: Thomas, pictured left with her husband and right with her father, says she kept quiet all these years because she felt somehow responsible for what happened to her . Cosby was already a famous comedian by that time but not yet a household name, as the premiere of his trailblazing sitcom The Cosby Show was still five months away. The stand-up comic was performing April 4, 1984, at Harrah's Hotel and Casino in Reno, and Thomas was told to meet him there for a coaching session. When the tall, slender model arrived in Nevada, she was picked up from the airport in a limousine. But instead of taking her to Harrah's, the driver transported Thomas to a private home on the outskirts of town, telling her that a friend had lent Cosby the property so he wouldn't be assailed by paparazzi. Bill Cosby greeted Thomas at the entrance and ushered her inside, according to the woman. The aspiring actress began by performing a monologue for Cosby, who then asked her to do a cold read of a person who was intoxicated. Thomas said Bill Cosby was not impressed because to his mind, she was not convincing as a drunk. Change of heart: Mrs Thomas, seen here with her husband, decided to speak out about the 1984 incident after learning that her mother knew about it . Heidi Thomas recalled that Cosby wanted her to relax, so he poured her a glass of Chablis. The married music teacher said that her memory of the next several hours is very hazy, but when she woke up later that night, she found herself in bed next to a naked Bill Cosby who was 'forcing himself' in her mouth. According to the woman, the married comedian then got on top of her and said to her: 'I'm your friend... your friend is gonna [ejaculate] again,' according to the 54-year-old mother of three. Thomas said she was confused as to what happened and eventually stormed out of the room and slammed the door behind her, but she later apologized to Cosby for being rude. Thomas' memory of the remainder of her four-day trip to Reno is foggy. She recalled riding with Cosby to Harrah’s and having a drink with him before the show, but not much else. She could not even recall calling her mother from Reno to tell her that she had done something ‘wrong,’ or getting on a plane to go home. Thomas also had no memory of being picked up by her parents at the airport in Denver. Months later, Heidi Thomas attended Bill Cosby's show in St Louis and went backstage to meet him, but she never brought up their encounter in Reno. The former model kept the incident a secret from everyone for three decades, believing that she was somehow to blame for what happened. But Thomas said she had a change of heart a couple of weeks ago when her mother, Greta Lea Johnson, finally told her about the disturbing phone call from Reno 30 years ago. Mrs Johnson said she kept mum about the conversation with her daughter all these years because she wanted things to go back to normal. ‘I finally find out that she knows, that dad knows, that they are supporting me if I want to go public...Then it became full steam ahead, I want to empower people,’ Heidi Thomas told CNN.","Cosby's latest accuser is Heidi Thomas, 54, a music teacher and married mother of three from Colorado .

"The missing plane MH370 could have been 'cyber-hijacked' using advanced electronic warfare technology, a new book co-written by a former lead Law and Order: SVU actor suggests. The controversial theory is one among several canvassed in the new 257-page essay Someone Is Hiding Something, which also asks whether UFOs could be responsible for its disappearance. The book was co-written by actor Richard Belzer - better known as detective John Munch in the syndicated fictional crime drama - radio host George Noory and author David Wayne. It's the latest in a series of publications and documentaries published since the plane went missing, with some aviation experts writing off the 'cyberhijacking' theory as 'far fetched'. On the hunt: Actor Richard Belzer is one of three authors of a new book examining various theories about the fate of missing flight  MH370 . Actor and author Richard Belzer (pictured as Detective John Munch in Law and Order) has turned his attention to the hunt for missing flight MH370 . No wreckage of the missing plane has been located by official search parties. The Boeing 770-300 vanished on March 8 2014 . But Perth widow Danica Weeks, whose husband Paul was on board, said that while she has been 'bombarded' with theories brought about by a slew of books, she has now become 'numb' to them. 'Someone's got to be right,' she said. 'I myself can't explain how such a sophisticated plane can just disappear.' The current phase of the MH370 search will conclude in May, with the head of Australian Transport Safety Bureau saying he is hopeful the wreckage will hopefully be found in the next few months. The head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has said he is optimistic the plane will be found by May . 'POSSIBLE THEORIES' PUBLISHED IN THE BOOK . 'CYBERJACKING' The authors believe the idea the plane was downed by 'cyberjackers' is among the more credible possibilities. 'Cyber hijacking is about the only possibility that fits the above circumstances insofar as the known evidence regarding the actions of the plane,' the book said. 'We’re not saying that’s what happened. The evidence, at this juncture, is inconclusive. 'We are saying that the official version of “We lost the plane and it may never be found” is an obvious ruse and a very weak one at that. 'What we keep hearing as the official explanation of this case has got more holes in it than Swiss cheese—and a pretty “holey” batch of Swiss cheese.' Investigators searching for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 say they could finish scouring the priority zone by May, more than a year after it vanished, if there are no delays . 'LANDED AT A MILITARY BASE' One of the most popular theories circulated online is that the flight was diverted to a U.S. military base in the Indian Ocean, on the island of Diego Garcia. It's a theory that still 'cannot be ruled out', the authors contend. 'All in all, the evidence indicates that diverting Flight 370 to Diego Garcia, by whatever means, for whatever reasons, cannot be ruled out as a possibility. 'And we’re not saying that we know what those reasons are, or that that is definitively what happened to Flight 370. 'But we are saying that diversion to Diego Garcia cannot currently be eliminated as a possibility,' they write. The initial international search effort involved more than a dozen planes and at least nine ships . 'MISSILE SHOOT DOWN' An 'accidental or intentional' strike followed by 'surreptitious debris retrieval' is highlighted as another theory by the authors. Given the widespread debris that would such an attack would cause, the authors suggest that the enormous search afterwards was 'actually part of a larger plan to discreetly recover and destroy what little evidence of the aircraft remained after the strike'. Search team: International search crews have been unable to locate the missing flight in the Indian Ocean . 'ALIEN CONTACT' Co-author George Noory, who runs a US radio show that examines 'unexplained phenomena', told the Nine Network on Wednesday the possibility of alien intervention was 'fantastic, but possible'. In the book itself, the authors admit the eyebrow-raising possibility is rather unlikely, noting there is 'no evidence' so far. But the truth is out there, they write. 'So, how does the possibility of alien life relate to Malaysia Flight 370, one might ask? That’s a damn good question. We have no idea. 'It’s just that it’s something that a discernible percentage of the population actually believes in and - if it is true - it’s an unknown that some apparently believe could possibly explain many otherwise unexplainable things, including the bizarre circumstances of Flight 370. The ADV Ocean Shield (pictured), an Australian vessel, was involved in the initial search for the downed plane . USE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES . The book posits that an advanced kind of electronic warfare technology could be deployed to 'hide' the missing plane. 'Today’s electronic warfare (EW) capability includes weaponry that can hide planes,' the authors write in one passage. Despite the lack of any evidence indicating sabotage, the book concludes the use of a 'cloaking technique' 'remains possible'. Someone Is Hiding Something: What Happened to Flight MH370 by Richard Belzer, David Wayne and George Noory is published by Nero and on sale now.","New book co-written by Law and Order star suggests 'cyber-hijacking' a plausible theory .

"A seal that was left struggling to breathe after being born with illegal netting around its neck which dug in to leave a gaping wound was able to swim away unrestricted for the first time in its life after being freed by rescuers. Video footage shows the seal struggling to escape as the net bit into its skin as it  lay helpless on a beach in Shetland, where it was stranded for three days as rescuers battled bad weather to reach it. The animal appeared to be choking to death but the moment it was cut free it made its way for the open sea, stealing a look back at its rescuers as if in a nod to say thank you. Scroll down for video . Rescuers found a seal with a deep gaping wound around its neck, which had been cut by a net the animal was likely to have been caught up in since it was born. The animal was choking and struggling to breathe . Shortly after being freed from the net the seal made for the sea and turned around quickly to look at rescuers . The monofilament wires of the net - illegal in the UK for almost 30 years - may have been wrapped around the seal's neck for up to a year. The animal is likely to have been in agony as it grew from a pup and the net cut deeper into its neck as it got larger. Experts believe the wound will eventually be healed by the sterilising effect of seawater and that the seal will make a full recovery. The animal was first spotted on a beach on Saturday in Fethaland on the northern tip of the mainland. The weather was so bad that rescuers could not get to the area for three days. Jan Bebington, who runs the Hillswick Wildlife Sanctuary along with husband Pete, said: 'We managed to get down on Tuesday but we almost gave up when we couldn't find the seal. Thankfully, as we were leaving the beach someone spotted it and we were able to help. 'The net was cutting really deeply into its throat and it could hardly breathe. We covered its head so it wouldn't be startled or bite, and after about five minutes managed to cut all the monofilament off. The seal was found lying helplessly on a beach in Shetland, choking and struggling to breathe or move . Rescuers worked hard to free the seal from the net, which had been wrapped around its neck for a year . Rescuers approached the animal and cut away the illegal netting, freeing it for the first time in its life . 'The seal just lay there very still the whole time - I think it could tell we were trying to help it. 'However, as soon as the net was off it rocketed into the sea. It was lovely to see and it even turned around one last time before disappearing.' Mrs Bebington said the seal was in such pain it would have been unable to dive for food and would have had intense difficulty eating and breathing. She said: 'If we hadn't found it, it would have died a slow and very horrible death. It was already very thin and emaciated so it wouldn't have eaten for a long time. Mrs Bebington said that finding seals in this condition was a 'regular occurrence' and made a plea to fishermen not to abandon their nets. Shortly after the seal was released it made a dash for the sea, making the most of its new freedom . Experts believe the salt in the sea water will disinfect the wound, and allow the deep cut to heal properly . Rescuers urged people to stop using the illegal nets to prevent more animals being caught up in them . Monofilament nets were banned in 1986 because of the impact they were having on the environment . 'This type of netting is now illegal, but unfortunately a lot is still floating around in the sea,' she added. 'I would urge fishermen to not abandon their nets in the sea, and if anyone sees nets floating around to pick them up and take them away from the beach.' Monofilament nets consist of thin mesh-like plastic wires which used to be popular for catching fish. They are cheap to produce and are effective as their clear colouring makes it hard for fish to spot them before it is too late. However, in 1986, the use of monofilament nets for inshore fishing in Scotland was made illegal, due to the environmental impact they were causing and to protect salmon stocks. A Scottish SPCA spokesperson said: 'We would urge anyone fishing to show consideration to the natural environment and its wild inhabitants. It's vital that people make sure they clear away every last piece of fishing equipment as it could save an animal's life.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Paris police are holding three Al-Jazeera reporters for allegedly flying a drone, days after the machines sparked a terror alert in the city. Journalists from the Qatar-funded news network were arrested in a park in the French capital from where they were illegally operating a drone, a judicial source told AFP. The arrests come after drones were on Monday seen buzzing the Eiffel Tower, Bastille Square and the U.S. embassy, then on to the Place de la Concorde and the Invalides military museum, where Napoleon is buried. Fear: Drones were spotted flying near the Invalides military museum, where Napoleon Bonaparte is buried . French security sources where unable to catch the drones, which are typically fitted with cameras and can be used for target surveillance to assess security and any spikes in pedestrian footfall ahead of a planned attack. The Al-Jazeera reporters arrested today, aged 70, 54 and 36, were arrested yesterday afternoon after police saw a drone flying in the Bois de Boulogne woods in western Paris, said Paris prosecutors' spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre. She said it was unclear what the trio were trying to accomplish. A judicial source earlier told AFP: 'The first was piloting the drone, the second was filming and the third was watching.' Responding to an Associated Press request for comment, Doha-based Al-Jazeera said: 'Three Al-Jazeera English journalists have been held by police in Paris while filming a report on the city's recent mystery drones. 'We will comment further when more information is available.' The journalists can be held for a maximum of 24 hours under French law. Flying drones without a license in France is illegal and carries a maximum one-year prison sentence and a 75,000 euros ($85,000) fine. Alert: Paris is on alert for a new terror attack after 'at least' five drones were spotted illegally flying around city landmarks, including the  the U.S. embassy building (pictured) Tension: Drones were also seen flying around the world-famous Eiffel Tower . New threat: French law bans small, civilian drones from areas such as nuclear facilities, which are protected by a no-fly zone that spans a 1.6-mile radius and a height of 1,000 metres. The above drone crashed on the grass near the White House in the United States last month . A map showing where the drones have been sighted in Paris . There is so far no suggestion the Al-Jazeera journalists are linked this week's night-time drone sightings over Paris, including on Monday and Tuesday nights. Police sighted one or more drones in five instances buzzing in the Paris sky in the night of Tuesday to Wednesday - from 11.30pm to 2am. An unidentified flying object was first seen Tuesday night near the Gare de l'Est train station, with sightings continuing in sequence for over two hours over the Paris Opera, then on to the Tuileries gardens, past the Eiffel Tower and then south past Paris' Montparnasse Tower, according to Thibault-Lecuivre. An inquiry was launched after drones, which are banned over Paris, were also spotted Monday night - beginning over the U.S. Embassy at around midnight on Monday. Between then and 6am the Eiffel Tower, Bastille Square, the Place de la Concorde and the Invalides military museum 'were also flown over' , a security source said. 'It could be a coordinated action but we don't know for now,' the source, who asked not to be identified, added. 'We did everything to try and catch the operators but they were not found,' another source close to the investigation said. France has experienced a series of mysterious drone appearances in the last few months. On January 20, a pilotless aircraft briefly went over the presidential palace in Paris, while around 20 drones were earlier seen flying above nuclear power plants. However until Tuesday 'there have never been so many drones appearing in one night,' the security source said. Location: At some point between midnight and 6am on Monday, drone aircraft were spotted flying near Bastille Square . Tourist hotspot: The first drone sighting in the French capital was around midnight on Monday. Shortly after an unmanned aircraft was seen flying near the Place de la Concorde . The emergence of drones comes amid warnings by terrorist groups that they will attack the city, following January shootings which left a total of 20 dead, including three terrorists. ‘They could be seen throughout the night, but nobody knows who were operating them,’ said a police source in the capital. A specialist police aviation unit tried to establish who was at the controls, but there have been no arrests. There have been other mysterious drone flights across Paris, but this is the first time that such a concentrated number have been seen above so many potentially vulnerable targets. The US embassy has been threatened by numerous groups in the past, from Al-Qaeda to Algeria’s Armed Islamic Group. French law bans small, civilian drones from areas such as nuclear facilities, which are protected by a no-fly zone that spans a 1.6-mile radius and a height of 1,000 metres. Experts say that the small unmanned craft would not pose a threat if crashed into a hardened nuclear facility. Fightback: Earlier this month France unveiled its latest weapon against the growing menace of rogue drones buzzing through their nation's skies: another drone, with a net . Caught: In a demonstration in La Queue-en-Brie, east of Paris, the mesh-wielding flying machine was shown snaring a DJI Phantom 2 drone - the same brand as one which crashed onto the White House lawn last month . France has barred six 'would-be jihadists' from leaving the country after discovering their plans to travel to Syria and join the Islamic State terror group. It the first such travel ban under a new law aimed at preventing French Islamic radicals travelling to the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq currently under the control of Sunni extremists. French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve says some 40 other French citizens will face travel bans in the coming weeks. He did not reveal the identity of the six people whose passports have already been confiscated. The bans are the first since a sweeping anti-terrorism law passed in France last year. The government is especially worried since attacks in Paris last month killed 20 people, including three gunmen claiming ties to Islamic extremists in Syria and Yemen. An Interior Ministry official says the passports and ID cards of the six have been declared invalid for six months - a measure that can be extended for up to two years. The news comes just days after Cazeneuve said he asked Google, Facebook and Twitter to work directly with French officials during investigations and to immediately remove terrorist propaganda when authorities alert them to it. Earlier this month France unveiled its latest weapon against the growing menace of rogue drones buzzing through their nation's skies: another drone, with a net. In a demonstration flight in La Queue-en-Brie, east of Paris, the mesh-wielding flying machine was shown snaring a DJI Phantom 2 drone - the same brand as one which crashed onto the White House lawn last month. The U.S. Secret Service was sent scrambling by the unexpected intrusion, but France has already faced dozens of drone overflights over sensitive sites. Mystery drones have buzzed nuclear plants, military installations and even the presidential palace in recent months, as fears run high of terror attacks linked to the Islamic State terror group. Concerned at the new technology, officials have asked scientists and companies to develop ways to monitor and detect intruding drones and their remote-control pilots; analyse and track their flight paths; and ultimately neutralise the drones, either temporarily or permanently, with the least collateral damage possible. Last October it emerged that holidaymakers who are planning to fly a camera-equipped drone in Paris’ tourist zones risk spending time in jail and being slapped with a hefty fine. An Israeli tourist found out the hard way this week when he was arrested in front of Notre Dame Cathedral while flying a drone above some of Paris’ top attractions.","The reporters were allegedly operating the drone from a suburban park .

"A commuter train bound for Los Angeles derailed before dawn on Tuesday in a fiery collision with an abandoned commercial pickup after the truck's driver took a wrong turn and got stuck on the tracks. That driver, Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez, 54, of Yuma, Arizona, was briefly hospitalized then arrested Tuesday afternoon on suspicion of felony hit-and-run,said Jason Benites, an assistant chief of the Oxnard Police Department. There was a loud boom and the screech of brakes before three of the train's five cars toppled over, sending 30 people to hospitals. Four were in critical condition, including the engineer. 'It seemed like an eternity while we were flying around the train. Everything was flying,' said passenger Joel Bingham. Investigators are seen behind police tape as they walk past the mangled truck driven by Alejandro sanchez-Ramirez that was hit by a Los Angeles-bound Metrolink train in Oxnard, California on Tuesday . 'A brush of death definitely came over me.' Lives were likely saved by passenger cars designed to absorb a crash. They were purchased after a deadly collision a decade ago, Metrolink officials said. The four passenger cars remained largely intact, as did the locomotive. Police found the disoriented driver of the demolished Ford F-450 pickup 1.6 miles from the crossing 45 minutes after the crash, said Benites. Sanchez-Ramirez, who delivers produce, was driving a pickup with an empty bed pulling a trailer with some welding equipment in it. He told police he tried to turn right at an intersection but turned prematurely and his truck got stuck straddling the rails. Police said they tested Sanchez-Ramirez for drugs and alcohol but they would not discuss the results. There were no fatalities following the crash of a commuter train which was on its way to Los Angeles but 28 people were injured, four in a critical condition . The crossing where the crash happened has been the scene of many collisions over the years. The train, the first of the morning on the Ventura route, had just left its second stop of Oxnard on its way to downtown Los Angeles, about 65 miles away, when it struck the truck around 5:45 a.m. There were 48 passengers aboard and three crew members who were all injured. The engineer saw the abandoned vehicle and hit the brakes but there wasn't enough time to stop, Oxnard Fire Battalion Chief Sergio Martinez said. Bingham said the lights went out when the train fell over. He was banged up from head to toe but managed to find an escape for himself and others, many of whom had been asleep when the crash happened. 'I was just shaking,' he said. 'I opened the window and told everybody, `Come to my voice.' Firefighters set up red, yellow and green tarps to categorize people according to their injuries, taking 28 to hospitals by ambulance. Two of the 22 people treated at the scene later showed up at hospitals, but only eight people had been admitted by the end of the day. 'Patients have complained of dizziness, of headaches, of lower back pain, of pains related to being bumped, thrown, hit and so forth,' said Dr. Bryan Wong, chief medical officer at Ventura County Medical Center. One patient described how he had been working on his laptop and a moment later there was a sudden jerking motion that happened so quickly he wasn't able to grab hold of anything, Wong said. He was violently tossed against a wall of the train. A fiery collision engulfed a tractor-trailer which was hit by a Metrolink commuter train in the early hours of Tuesday in Ventura County, California . The train typically would be accelerating out of the Oxnard station past verdant farm fields at about 55 mph, Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson said. With braking, he estimated it would have hit the truck at between 40 mph and 55 mph. The train was pushed by a locomotive in the rear, allowing trains to change direction after their run without having to turn around or swap engines. It's a configuration that has been criticized for putting passengers in a vulnerable position in a crash. After such a crash killed 11 people and injured 180 others in Glendale in 2005, Metrolink invested heavily to buy passenger cars with collapsible bumpers and other features to absorb impact. Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten said the Oxnard crash showed the technology worked. 'Safe to say it would have been much worse without it,' he said. A Metrolink train derailed Tuesday morning after it collided with a truck on the track in Ventura County . A Southern California Metrolink commuter train derailed early on Tuesday morning following a smash with a truck which then burst into flames . A firefighter crawls out of a derailed passenger train carriage at the scene of a Metrolink accident on Tuesday . The city of Oxnard has wanted to build a $30 million bridge over the crossing for 10 years, but is only at the environmental review stage, said Darren Kettle, executive director of the Ventura County Transportation Commission. There have been six accidents at the crossing in the past seven years, including one in which a driver accidently turned onto the tracks in 2010 and was struck by a Metrolink train and injured, according to federal railroad accident reports. Two people were killed at the crossing last year when a car struck an Amtrak train. Sanchez-Ramirez, the driver in Tuesday's crash, told police he turned onto the tracks before the crossing arm came down, which occurs 29 seconds before a train arrives. It wasn't clear how long his truck was stuck before the train hit it. The accident happened on the same line as Metrolink's worst disaster when 25 people were killed September 12, 2008. A firefighter climbs into the wreck of a Metrolink passenger train that derailed in agricultural country 65 miles northwest of Los Angeles . A commuter train engineer was texting and ran a red light, striking a Union Pacific freight train head-on in the San Fernando Valley community of Chatsworth. More than 100 people were hurt in what was one of the worst railroad accidents in U.S. history. The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Railroad Administration were sending investigators to the Tuesday crash in Oxnard. Cranes moved the trains at the end of the day, but the tracks, which are also used by Amtrak and freight trains, remained shut down. Officials initially said that the driver had stopped his produce truck on the tracks and the accident was 'avoidable'. However at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Oxnard police Officer Miguel Lopez said the man may have accidentally turned on to the tracks and become stuck became he did not know the area. When police first responded to the scene they found the tractor-trailer 'engulfed in flames'. Once fire crews extinguished the blaze, police found the cabin of the truck empty. It was also not clear if the truck was carrying any produce at the time of the crash. A patrol cop later found a 'disorientated man' walking along the side of the road and who was confirmed to be the driver. Authorities described the driver as 'unsettled' but would not say if he was under the influence of alcohol or substances. It was also unclear if the driver was properly licensed. Video shot from a helicopter revealed train carriages overturned after the crash. Some 28 people were injured according to officials . The force of the collision had forced one of the carriages on to the highway in Southern California, just northwest of LA .

Some commuters from the derailed train were treated at the scene in California following the early hours collision with a tractor-trailer . Footage from a news helicopter showed firefighters treating numerous people at the scene in California . The collision happened around 65 miles northwest of Los Angeles, California in the city of Oxnard . The crash was reported at 5.44am on Tuesday, according to officials. Some 51 people were traveling on board the train to LA at the time. According to the LA Times, three of the four train carriages had a 'crash energy management'. Metrolink's website explains that since 2010, 117 new cars used by the rail company have had the latest safety technology which included redesigned seats, work tables and 'energy absorbing' zones at the ends of cars. One overturned train carriage was lying half on the tracks and half on the highway running parallel to the train line. Some passengers were treated in triage areas set up at the scene while others were taken by ambulance to local hospitals. Firefighters and emergency responders were seen treating numerous people at the scene, ABC7 reported. Metrolink's website says the train was on a run from Ventura County to Los Angeles. Metrolink tweeted: 'VC Line 102 to Los Angeles is stopped between Oxnard & Camarillo due to striking a vehicle on the tracks.' The company canceled trains on the line on Tuesday and encouraged commuters to seek alternative transport. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a 'go-team' on Tuesday to the scene of the accident. The scene was in Oxnard, about 65 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Prior to Tuesday's collision of a Metrolink train with a tractor-trailer in Ventura County, the Southern California rail company has had several major accidents. Tuesday's accident left around 30 people injured but no fatalities, according to fire chiefs. In 2002, two people were killed and 22 other passengers seriously injured when a BNSF freight train hit a Metrolink train in Placentia, California, head-on. Three years later, a crash in Glendale, California (pictured right), killed 11 people and left more than 100 injured with 40 passengers left in a serious condition. A Metrolink passenger train hit a vehicle on the tracks, jackknifed and smashed into a freight locomotive and a Metrolink train traveling the opposite way. The driver of the vehicle left on the tracks in 2005 was charged with 11 counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without parole in June 2008. In 2008, 26 people were killed and 135 injured when a train collided with a Union Pacific freight train and toppled carriages in the Chatsworth neighborhood of LA.

"Peter Pan's opening line of 'All children, except one, grow up', is the nation's most memorable . Peter Pan is the book with the nation's favourite opening line, according to a new poll. 'All children, except one, grow up,' wrote JM Barrie in his children's classic which scooped 20per cent of the vote in a poll commissioned to mark World Book Day next month. But it's not just childhood fairytales that adults have fond memories of, as the opening lines from classic 19th Century novel A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens came second place, while George Orwell's 1984 completed the top three. However, the first words of 50 Shades of Grey did little to inspire as just one in 20 (five per cent) were wooed by EL James' opening line. One in five of those polled admitted they will put a book down if the first line isn't engaging. However, one in four (25per cent) said they will continue reading a novel to the end even if they don't enjoy it and, with complete disregard for the opening line, 15per cent admit jumping to the last chapter first to find out a book's ending. When it comes to reading with their children, one in eight parents (12per cent) say youngsters will switch off if a book doesn't capture their imagination quickly, and one in 10 are forced to adopt the characters' voices to make reading more enjoyable. Parents know when they deserve an Oscar, as one in seven children (14per cent) will enjoy a book so much that they will read it again and 21per cent of people admit they've used a line from a book as their own in order to impress a member of the opposite sex. The poll was commissioned by Asda. Laura Grooby, Asda's book buyer, said: 'First impressions are everything, and even though hundreds of new books are released every week, it is clear the nation never forgets a famous opening line. 'This year, we hope by encouraging everyone to pick up and persevere with a book on World Book Day, children and adults alike will enjoy the pleasures reading can bring.'

'It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.' - 1984 . 4. 'When Mr Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.' - The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring . 5. 'Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ""and what is the use of a book,"" thought Alice ""without pictures or conversation?""' - Alice in Wonderland . 6.

Apple also added several new cities to the flyover feature of its Maps app in a bid to rival Google. Scroll down for video of the new feature in action . The new feature can be seen on Big Ben - which now moves and displays the correct time . The firm has made a huge effort to boost the quality of its maps. One of the most impressive features are the 3D flyovers of major cities, which Apple creates using data from plane and helicopter flyovers . Today Apple added Edinburgh, Scotland; Linz, Austria; Venice, Italy; Cáceres, Spain; Rennes, France; Guadalajara, Mexico and Ponce, Puerto Rico. Also additional US cities. Apple has made a huge effort to boost the quality of its maps. One of the most impressive features are the 3D flyovers of major cities, and today Apple added Edinburgh, Scotland; Linz, Austria; Venice, Italy; Cáceres, Spain; Rennes, France; Guadalajara, Mexico and Ponce, Puerto Rico. Also additional US cities. 'Flyover in Apple Maps lets you see select major metro areas from the air with photo-realistic, interactive 3D views,' the firm says. 'You can explore cities in high resolution as you zoom, pan, tilt, and rotate around the city and its landmarks.' Apple has also taken steps to boost the number of places available, and the information about them. In October, it launched launched Maps Connect in the US, enabling businesses to edit or add listings, as well as set up indoor mapping within selected areas. Entries made by businesses typically show up in Apple Maps around a week later. The international rollout has reached the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and Singapore, and was today  expanded to Canada, France and Germany. The service has also gained two new language options, French and German, to correspond with the regional expansion. Apple also finally switched from Google Maps to its own mapping service on iCloud.com in December. Apple-leased camera cars have been spotted recently, with some suggesting that they are being used to add Street View style images to Apple Maps, while others believe they are part of the Apple 'Titan' Car project. The London Eye has also been updated, and now rotates and users see it . Apple has also added Venice to its flyover section, allowing people to tour in 3D . Last year the service hit the headlines when one user claimed he has spotted Nessie on it. This shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly with two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by a satellite. For six months the image has been studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, where excitement is mounting after various explanations for it were ruled out... leaving them to conclude it is ‘likely’ to be the elusive beast. Google also offers a 3D version of its map showing Big Ben - but the image is stativ . A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, may have provided proof that the legend lives on - with amazing images of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch . This new sonar image was revealed just weeks after satellite images appeared to show a mystery object in the loch. A shadowy form, pictured, measuring around 100ft long (30 metres) with two giant flippers was photographed by a satellite and spotted on the Apple Maps app . Club president Gary Campbell, who keeps a register of sightings, said: ‘We’ve been looking at it for a long time trying to work out exactly what it is. ‘It looks like a boat wake, but the boat is missing. 'You can see some boats moored at the shore, but there isn’t one here. 'We’ve shown it to boat experts and they don’t know what it is. ‘Whatever this is, it is under the water and heading south, so unless there have been secret submarine trials going on in the loch, the size of the object would make it likely to be Nessie.’","Features initially only available for London landmarks .

"A Hungarian mayor is putting his entire village up for rent to put it on the map and bring in some cash, even offering the deputy mayorship as part of the bargain. For 210,000 forints - around £500 - a day, interested parties can rent out all facilities in the pretty but largely deserted village of Megyer, which has a population of 18 and is located 180 kilometres (110 miles) southwest of Budapest. An advertisement posted online Monday says rental includes use of Megyer's four streets, two of them asphalted and two gravel, as well as the mayor's office, the cultural centre, the bus-stop, and seven furnished 'peasant-style' houses.

Tenants can also use the village cooperative's six horses, two cows, three sheep, poultry house and four hectares of arable land. A 42-year-old engineer from Budapest, Pajer said he fell in love with tiny Megyer when he first passed by it by chance ten years ago. A year later, soon after buying a property there, he was elected mayor.

"David Cameron admitted yesterday he should cut benefits and tax credits for immigrants more quickly to stop Britain being such a ‘massive draw’. The PM was asked by MPs about what lessons he would draw from the Government’s failure to hit its net migration target. Giving evidence to the Commons liaison committee he said: ‘The biggest lesson I would learn is we need to act more rapidly on the financial draw to Britain. David Cameron pictured yesterday at the Liaison Select Committee said he would cut migrant's benefits . ‘I think that the way the tax credit system and benefit systems work to make Britain a massive draw – not only because we’re creating so many jobs but also the financial draw – we needed to act on that faster. ‘I have made very clear pledges about what will happen in the next Parliament if I’m lucky enough to come to another one of these meetings.’ In 2010, Mr Cameron pledged to reduce net migration – the number of arrivals minus departures – to below 100,000. But despite sharp cuts in the number of non-EU migrants, a surge in European arrivals means the figure has barely changed in the past five years. The figure currently is 260,000 a year. In November, Mr Cameron promised to stop EU migrants claiming in-work benefits, such as tax credits, and getting access to social housing for four years. Mr Cameron, pictured, has pledged to stop EU migrants from accessing social housing for four years . Child benefit and out-of-work benefits will also be curbed, he said. The measures will form the centrepiece of his proposed renegotiation of EU free movement rules ahead of a proposed referendum in 2017. Some Tory backbenchers were disappointed by the speech because it stopped short of more robust action, including a temporary ban on migrants – the so-called emergency brake. It emerged that No 10 dumped the idea after German Chancellor Angela Merkel made it clear it would not win EU support. The Tories are expected to keep the net migration target as part of their election manifesto. Last month Mr Cameron said Britain would be a ‘better, stronger country’ if the number of immigrants was cut.","David Cameron appeared in front of a parliamentary committee yesterday .

"It's synonymous with rock chicks and is a fabric beloved of the style set - but you don't often see a royal stepping out in leather. One who does is Spain's Queen Letizia who stepped out in a fitted burgundy dress crafted from the fabric in Madrid today. But in true royal style, what could have been a risqué look was toned down with one of the 42-year-old's trademark tailored jackets. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Letizia opted for a burgundy leather dress for her meeting in Madrid today . The more serious approach to dressing was echoed in the theme of the day's events, with the royal on businesslike form for a meeting with the board of the Royal Council on Disability. One of Letizia's favoured causes, the mother-of-two appeared deep in concentration as she listened to the points raised by her fellow board members. The visit was the first outing of the week for Letizia, who spent much of last week championing another of her favoured causes - Spanish culture. That saw her travel to the town of La Coruna where, with 47-year-old husband King Felipe, she toured the Museo de Belas Artes. All business: She kept the dress businesslike by adding a tailored jacket and a pair of matching plum courts . Paying attention: She appeared deep in concentration during the meeting for the Royal Council on Disabilies . Keeping busy: The meeting was Letizia's first of the week and follows a busy period of cultural pursuits . The previous week, again with King Felipe, she hosted the National Culture Awards and welcomed some of Spain's finest writers, directors and actors to the El Pardo Palace in Madrid. Both Letizia, a former journalist, and Felipe are famous for championing Spanish culture, with Letizia even flying to Vienna last October to open an exhibition dedicated to Diego Velázquez. Velázquez, who was born in 1599, is best known for his 1656 work, Las Meninas, which is usually housed in Madrid's Prado Museum. The painting, which shows Infanta Margarita Teresa surrounded by her maids of honour and servants, was commissioned by Felipe IV - an ancestor of the current King Felipe.
