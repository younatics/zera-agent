A grandfather badly burned in a huge explosion caused by a cowboy plumber's botched handy work dived back into his burning bungalow to rescue his nine-year-old granddaughter. Pensioner John Davies was almost killed following the gas blast which left him temporarily blinded with 21 per cent burns. Remarkably despite writhing in flames which he put out by diving into snow, Mr Davies, 67, still managed to rescue Amelia from a bedroom in the £100,000 bungalow in Willenhall, West Midlands. Pensioner John Davies was left temporarily blinded by the explosion and suffered 21 per cent burns . And the days following the terrifying ordeal in December last year Amelia, who was unharmed, touchingly offered to be her granddads 'eyes' after the former delivery driver was struggled to see following the explosion. Plumber Peter Naylor escaped a jail sentence yesterday at Wolverhampton Crown Court.  He was given a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for a year, and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work after admitting a health and safety breach. The court heard Naylor had agreed a fee of £125 to fix a dripping tap and needed to remove a gas meter - which he was not qualified to do - to get to it. But the 61-year-old's work flooded the kitchen and he left Mr Davies to dry it out while he went to fetch a part. Plumber Peter Naylor, left, escaped a jail sentence yesterday at Wolverhampton Crown Court following the explosion where Mr Davies, right, was badly burned . The grandfather-of-two plugged in an electric heater in an effort to speed up the dry-out. But a huge explosive took hold and ripped the house apart after gas had been left to seep out. Today the couple spoke for the first time about how their lives have been turned upside down by the devastating accident. Recalling the incident, a tearful Mr Davies said: 'I can remember looking at the heater and thinking it was melting. Then I heard a bang and what happened after that I just don't know. 'I remember going out the back and rolling in the snow. The flames were all on my arms and my clothes were stuck to me. The snow saved my life and I feel lucky to be alive.' Mr Davies' and his wife Margaret, 65, told how they had lost all their possessions, including photographs and a cherished china tea set which once belonged to her mother . Mr Davies was left with 21 per cent burns to his face, neck and hands, but went back inside to rescue his nine-year old granddaughter Amelia. She escaped unharmed but the bungalow had to be demolished following the drama.  Mr Davies spent three weeks in the burns unit at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital. He had a skin graft to his left hand, which now has less grip. His face remains tender and he needs to stay in the shade on sunny holidays. Mr Davies recalled how Amelia had carried a TV into his bedroom while he was recovering. 'She said 'I know you can't watch it but if you want to know anything, I will tell you. If you want I'll be your eyes.' Mr Davies' wife Margaret, 65, told how the couple had lost all their possessions, including photographs and a cherished china tea set which once belonged to her mother. The couple, who have a grown-up son and daughter, are now living in rented accommodation in Bilston, West Midlands, paid for by their insurers while a new bungalow is built on the same site. Mr Davies, pictured with his wife Margaret, said he remembers rolling in the snow with flames on his arms . Mr Davies, who denied Naylor's claims that he had warned him he was unqualified, said he had hoped Naylor would have got a longer sentence. Self-employed Naylor, who has now retired after a 30 year career, was uninsured. Richard Quinn, defending, told Wolverhampton Crown Court: 'He's extremely remorseful and he's been having difficulty sleeping. The plight of Mr Davies is constantly on his mind. He completely and utterly accepts the blame.' Judge Imaged Nawaz told Naylor: 'What you did was so, so reckless that you nearly caused the death of a number of people.' Speaking after the sentence, Mr Davies added: 'I am very, very lucky to be alive and my granddaughter.' His wife of 44-years, who was out shopping at the time of the explosion, said: 'Ever since it's happened, Amelia's been all about her Grandad.' Destroyed: The bungalow had to be demolished following the explosion and is being rebuilt .","John Davies was covered in flames but saved his life by diving into the snow to put himself out .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:28 AM on 20th July 2011 . Marksmen are to be licensed to shoot at least 35,000 badgers every year to halt the spread of TB in cattle. Environment minister Caroline Spelman yesterday gave the go-ahead for two pilot badger culls on farms in the South West next summer. If the trials are successful, a bigger slaughter covering more than 5,000 square miles of English farmland will get under way. Wildlife groups warned the ‘controlled shootings’ could leave thousands of badgers maimed and injured. Ahead of the announcement, the RSPCS said it believed that at least 70 per cent of the badger population in large areas of the country would be killed . There are approximately 190,000 badgers in England. The move was also condemned by Labour, . with shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh claiming it was prompted . by 'short-term political calculation' and was not backed by scientific . evidence. Farmers have called for action for . years, but mass slaughter of the animals has polarised opinion, with . wildlife campaigners bitterly opposed. Farmers say badgers are one of the greatest . threats currently facing beef and dairy farmers and believe that a cull would save them money in the long run. Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman insisted: 'I believe this is the right way forward.' David Bowles, director of communications for the RSPCA, said: 'Today is a black day for badgers - a day we have been dreading. 'At a time when the Welsh government . has stepped back from a cull, the government in England is slowly . shredding its own animal welfare credentials.' The charity said vaccination of . badgers, increased levels of testing, improved biosecurity and stricter . controls on the movement of cattle were betters ways of . ridding cattle of the disease. Ahead of the announcement, it said it believed that at least 70 per cent of the badger population in . certain areas of the country would be killed, despite it saying . scientific studies showing that a cull would be of little help in . reducing the disease in the long term, and could actually make things . worse in some areas. Mrs Spelman said there would be further consultation on the proposed guidance issued to Natural England, who will issue culling licences, and in the first year there would be two pilot schemes. She said: 'I wish there was some other practical way of dealing with this, but we can't escape the fact that the evidence supports the case for a controlled reduction of the badger population in the areas worst affected by bovine TB. 'With the problem of TB spreading and no usable vaccine on the horizon, I'm strongly minded to allow controlled culling, carried out by groups of farmers and landowners as part of a science-led carefully managed policy of badger control.' Farmers want to see a policy to control badgers to tackle a problem they say is one of the greatest threats currently facing beef and dairy farmers . She added: 'Initially in the first year, the culling method would be piloted in two areas, to confirm the effectiveness and humaneness of controlled shooting. 'An independent panel of scientific experts will be asked to evaluate the pilots.' She said if culling was ultimately authorised 'we will look to the farmers involved to show that they take their responsibility very seriously and that they are committed to delivering culling effectively and humanely'. Efforts to control the disease have been hampered by the transmission of TB bacteria between wild badgers and cattle. Approximately 25,000 cattle were slaughtered in England that year for TB control . The number of new incidents of TB in 2010 increased by 7.5 per cent from 2009 to 3,622 . £500 million has been spent in the . last 10 years combating the disease . The disease will cost the economy £9 billion over the next 40 years without further action to tackle it . There are an estimated 190,000 badgers in England . Badgers cause the new infections . in cattle herds in around 40-50 per cent of cases . Under the new scheme, an estimated . 1,000-1,500 badgers will be culled in each 150 kilometre squared cull . area (60 square miles) over a period of four years . Beneficial effects to cattle from culling are seen after three years. The first injectable badger . vaccine, the BadgerBCG, was licensed in March 2010 . Vaccinating badgers costs an . average of £2,250 per year per km squared. Trapping and shooting badgers . costs £2,500 per year per km squared, while shooting free-running . badgers costs £200 per year per km squared . Colin Booty, senior scientist for . the RSPCA, said: 'The RSPCA is sympathetic to farmers struggling to . cope with the effects of this crippling disease and thinks that the . problem of bovine TB in cattle needs a sustainable and effective . solution. 'But this is not such a solution. We believe that the government have taken the wrong fork in the road with this risky policy. 'This cull will contribute little . or nothing to the long-term goal of eradicating TB nationally. Instead . it will wipe out huge numbers of this much-loved species, including many . animals which are healthy. Last week a key government adviser said a cull would be a mistake. Lord Krebs, who conducted a major review into badgers and bovine TB in the 1990s and recommended a trial cull which took place over the following 10 years, said he did not think it was 'an effective policy'. It has appeared likely over recent weeks the Environment Department would allow a cull, after experts including its chief scientist and chief vet concluded that co-ordinated and sustained culling of badgers, which can spread the disease to livestock, was likely to reduce TB rates in cattle. A two-page document produced following a meeting in April of the group of experts, set out the latest data from the randomised badger culling trials (RBCT), showing around a 16 per cent reduction in new infections in herds following a cull. But last week Lord Krebs, one of the scientific experts involved in the meeting, said: 'If you look at the evidence from the RBCT you will see that if you cull intensively for at least four years, you will have a net benefit of reducing TB in cattle of 12 per cent to 16 per cent. 'So you leave 85 per cent of the problem still there, having gone to a huge amount of trouble to cull a huge number of badgers. 'It doesn't seem to be an effective way of controlling the disease.'","Farmers says badgers are one of the greatest threats to beef and dairy farmers .

Just when it was starting to look like she might never get over her ex-girlfriend Sam Ronson, Lindsay Lohan has been pictured with a rumoured new love interest. The troubled star has been spending time with Spencer Falls, and were spotted last week leaving Lindsay's Venice Beach home together. Spencer is best known in the US as half of the spoof celebrity couple 'Sparah' in Virgin Mobile's latest ad campaign. New romance? Lindsay Lohan is pictured leaving her Venice Beach home with rumoured new man Spencer Falls . But it looks as though the wannabe star has just landed the real deal after he was caught enjoying an intimate dinner and drinks with the Mean Girls actress on July 12. Lindsay, wearing a paid of black short shorts with a knotted white shirt and black boots, flirted with the good-looking actor over cocktails, Star magazine claim. It is believed the new couple were introduced by their mutual friend, photographer Tyler Shields. Date night: The pair had an intimate dinner and drinks at the Chateau Marmont . Shields is a long time friend of Lindsay's and has recently gotten to know Spencer and his onscreen girlfriend, Sarah Carroll, after shooting them for an exhibition. Lindsay Lohan is due in court today (Thursday) for a progress hearing. The actress, who is on probation, is due to appear at the LAX Airport Courthouse in Los Angeles. There is no official word on why Judge Stephanie Sautner is hauling her before the court.

The City Attorney asked Judge Sautner to order Lindsay to appear.' Lohan's spokesman confirmed that she will be appearing in court, but didn't elaborate on why. It is not usual for a defendant to appear at a progress unless there is a problem. After Lindsay and Spencer's hot date, the pair met up with Tyler for a late-night photoshoot in a tunnel in downtown Los Angeles. The raunchy shoot sees Spencer fondling Lindsay's breast in one shot, and kissing her neck in another. Lindsay was pictured leaving Tyler's house in LA after midnight following the shoot.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:12 AM on 19th July 2011 . American children are safer being driven by their grandparents than by their parents, a new study has revealed. Researchers admitted they were 'surprised' by the findings, which shows children involved in accidents in cars driven by their older relatives are 50 per cent less likely to be injured. Previously, research has indicated that car crashes are more common in older drivers, mostly those aged over 65. Safer: Children driven by their grandparents are less likely to be injured in an accident, researchers have found. (Picture posed by models) Dr. Fred Henretig, an emergency medicine specialist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the study's lead author, said: 'We were surprised to discover that the injury rate was considerably lower in crashes where grandparents were the drivers.' The surprising results came from an analysis of insurance claims for 2003-07 car crashes in 15 states, involving nearly 12,000 children up to 15 years old. Only about 10 per cent of children in the study were driven by grandparents, but they suffered proportionately fewer injuries. Overall, 1.05 per cent of kids were injured when riding with parents, versus 0.70 per cent of those riding with grandparents - a 33 per cent lower risk. The difference was even more pronounced - 50 per cent - when the researchers took into account other things that could influence injury rates, including not using car seats, and older-model cars. Frazzled: Busy mothers and fathers could be more distracted and in a rush than the older generation . Dr Henretig, 64, said the study was prompted by his own experiences when his first grandchild was born three years ago. 'I found myself being very nervous on the occasions that we drove our granddaughter around and really wondered if anyone had ever looked at this before,' he said. Reasons for the unexpected findings are uncertain, but the researchers have a theory. 'Perhaps grandparents are made more nervous about the task of driving with the ""precious cargo"" of their grandchildren and establish more cautious driving habits' to compensate for any age-related challenges,' they wrote. Professor Joseph Schofer, a Northwestern University transport expert not involved in the research, noted that the average age of grandparents studied was 58. 'Grandparents today are not that old and don't fit the image of an impaired older driver,' he said. 'None of us should represent grandparents as kind of hobbling to the car on a walker.' Despite their surprising record, grandparents did fare less well on one measure of safety. Nearly all the children were in car seats or seat belts, but grandparents were slightly less likely to follow recommended practices, including rear-facing backseat car seats for infants and keeping youngsters out of the front seat. But that did not seem to make any difference to injury rates. The study does not include data on deaths, but Dr Henretig said there were very few. It also lacked information on the types of car trips involved; for example, driving in busy city traffic might increase chances for crashes with injuries. Professor Schofer said other unstudied circumstances could have played a role. For example, grandparents could be less distracted and less frazzled than busy parents dropping their kids off at school while rushing to get to work or to do errands. Driving trips might be 'quality time' for older drivers and their grandchildren, he said.","U.S. study analysed crashes involving 12,000 children in 15 states .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:49 AM on 20th July 2011 . This is one 'heel' remember for a while. Arab footballer Awana Diab amazed fans by tucking away 'the best penalty ever' with a nifty back heel. The 21-year-old ran up like any other spot-kick but moments before he was about to make contact he quickly spun and round took the penalty backwards. Heely good: United Arab Emirates star Awana Diab back heels the ball past the goalkeeper in what fans are calling the 'best penalty ever' Diab's unorthodox shot wrong-footed the goalkeeper who could only look on as the ball rolled into the net. But Diab's celebrations were cut short when he was booked for showboating and substituted by his manager - who had only brought him on three minutes earlier - for showing a 'lack of respect'. The impressive show of nerve and skill has become an internet sensation after the international friendly between the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. UAE were leading 5-2 when Diab stepped up to take the penalty. His successful conversion put his side 6-2 in front. Tricky: Diab calms his nerves moments before the penalty, and right, an angle from behind the goal shows how the keeper guessed the wrong way and was wrong-footed . Back heel to basics: Awana quickly spun round moments before kicking the ball to put his side 6-2 up against Lebanon in the international friendly .

We must respect players from . other teams. In future, you don’t know what football will give you back. 'This . is not respect. He’s a young guy and he knows he made a mistake . immediately. I just want him to show respect, not just on the field but . off it  as well.’ But the opposition manager did not have a problem with the spot-kick. 'I didn’t feel it was an insult,' Lebanon’s coach Emile Rustom said. Run up: The showboating sub, who had only been on the field for three minutes, runs up to the spot-kick . Is he mad?

Back of the net: The wrong-footed goalkeeper is left standing as the ball rolls over the line in the 7-2 drumming on Sunday . 'This is a personal decision the player made and it has nothing to do with the way the UAE plays its football.' The bizarre goal has become an internet hit - with legions of football fans heralding it as the 'best penalty ever'. One internet user wrote: 'What a classic goal. He was pretty brave to attempt such an extravagant penalty.' Another added: 'This was a courageous trick and the goalkeeper froze completely. Respect to the player.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:43 PM on 17th July 2011 . Rupert Murdoch's most long-serving and trusted servant has followed in the footsteps of Rebekah Brooks and fallen on his sword. Les Hinton, 67, who has worked for the tycoon for 52 years, has resigned from his post as chief executive of Dow Jones, which publishes the Wall Street Journal. His loss will hit Murdoch hard and adds weight to claims from one of President Obama's closest allies last night that his U.S. empire is beginning to 'explode and unravel' in the wake of the phone hacking scandal. Les Hinton has worked in Australia, the U.S. and the UK in various positions within Murdoch's organisation since starting out as reporter in Adelaide . The claim came as Murdoch's control over Fox and other cable channels appeared under increasing threat, with reports he could lose his television licences if found guilty of breaching anti-bribery laws . And Attorney General Eric Holder piled more pressure on the News Corporation chief, as he confirmed the Justice Department is considering opening a formal investigation into whether the company tried to hack into the voicemails of 9/11 victims. Hinton was executive chairman of . News International in London from 1995 to 2007, periods when the News of . the World was hacking phones. Growing crisis: Rupert Murdoch's U.S. media empire is beginning to 'explode and unravel', according to think tank president John Podesta . He said he knew nothing about the scandalous behaviour by journalists which also cost News Corp chief executive Brooks her job but added that ‘the pain caused to innocent people is unimaginable’ and it was ‘proper’ for him to resign from News Corp. Les Hinton was born in Bootle, on Merseyside but moved to Australia with his parents as a teenager. He joined the Adelaide News, which was then run by a young Rupert Murdoch in 1960. He followed him to The Sun six years later and then moved on to Americam, where he worked as a journalist for a number of the company's newspapers and magazines. He became a U.S. citizen after landing a senior job at Fox TV in 1986, but returned to Britain in 1995 to become chairman of News International. After Murdoch bought the Wall Street Journal, Mr Hinton transferred across the Atlantic again in 2007 to become the paper's chief executive and publisher. 'That I was ignorant of what apparently happened is irrelevant and in the circumstances I feel it is proper for me to resign.' He continued: 'When I left News International in December 2007, I believed that the rotten element at the News of the World had been eliminated, that important lessons had been learned and that journalistic integrity was restored. 'There had never been any evidence delivered to me that suggested the conduct had spread beyond one journalist. If others had evidence that wrongdoing went further, I was not told about it.' Murdoch said in a statement that he had accepted Mr Hinton's resignation with much sadness at losing his right-hand man after a remarkable journey. 'That this passage has come to an unexpected end, professionally, not personally, is a matter of much sadness to me,' he said. 'I vividly recall an enthusiastic young man in the offices of my first newspaper in Adelaide, where Les joined the company as a 15-year-old and had the rather unenviable task of buying me sandwiches for lunch.' Mr Murdoch added that 'News Corporation is not Rupert Murdoch. It is the collective creativity and effort of many thousands of people around the world, and few individuals have given more to this company than Les Hinton.' Salt was rubbed into the wound by comments last night from John Podesta, president of the Centre for American Progress, a liberal think tank, and the man who helped Obama's transition to the White House in 2008. He told the Globe and Mail: 'This is . not one rogue editor. This is an empire that was built on a set of . journalistic ethics that's beginning to explode and unravel. 'They . were routinely bribing public officials. We've called attention to the . fact that this story is going to go on for a while, this is not a . two-week story, I don't think.' Probe: Attorney General Eric Holder is considering launching a formal investigation into claims News Corp, for which John Podesta, of the Centre for American Progress, predicts a dire future . He is one of a number of senior Democrats hoping Murdoch's U.S. empire will fall in the wake of the scandal. The White House has long fought with Fox News, owned by News Corporation, and boycotted the channel for a time. Now there are increasing signs . Murdoch could lose control of all his cable channels in America, which . include National Geographic and FX as well as Fox. Under federal law, holders of television and radio stations . licences have to undergo character tests to show they are fit and . proper to be media owners. Murdoch seems unlikely to pass those tests if Wall . Street’s fierce regulator, The Securities and Exchange Commission, seeks to enforce the part of the foreign bribery law that requires . companies to keep accurate books, according to the Los Angeles Times. If . it is proven that a company violates this and U.S anti-bribery . provisions, there is a penalty of up to $2m, and if convicted, employees . could face up to five years in prison. Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, reportedly said this week the allegations should be investigated, but did not say whether his organisation would launch such a probe. Yesterday Mr Holder confirmed the . Department of Justice is responding to calls from lawmakers to . investigate claims News Corporation hacked into the phones of 9/11 . victims. At a press conference in Sydney, he . said: 'There have been serious allegations raised in that regard in . Great Britain; there is an ongoing investigation. Splash: Front page of the August 1, 2007 edition of the Wall Street Journal reporting that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp will purchase Dow Jones & Co . 'There have been members of Congress in the United States who have asked us to investigate those same allegations. And we are progressing in the regard using the appropriate federal agencies in the United States.' He also confirmed reports yesterday that the FBI has launched its own informal probe into the allegations. It comes as senior Democrats questioned whether Murdoch's American papers, such as the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal, may also have engaged in telephone hacking. The Democratic Senate Campaign Committee has already launched an online petition to demand the truth from Murdoch. It reads: 'It's time for Rupert Murdoch to come clean and immediately tell the American people whether his company targeted any American's here at home. Sign our petition to demand the truth.' By midday News Corporation shares were down 0.06 per cent as politicians and business experts rounded on Murdoch and the influence he has amassed over the media giant he founded. Representative Peter King wrote: ‘If . these allegations are proven true the conduct would merit felony charges . for attempting to violate various federal statues related to corruption . of public officials and prohibitions against wiretapping. ‘Any person found guilty of this purported conduct should receive the harshest sanctions available under law.’ Jeopardised: Any convictions against News Corporation could make obtaining television licenses for broadcasting programmes difficult . Some in the business world think Murdoch’s days are numbered at the helm of News Corporation. Porter Bibb, managing partner at Mediatech Capital Partners, was reported as saying: ‘It is very likely, there will be at some point... an entire new management. ‘It’s a fine company, it has great assets and a terrific future but Murdoch’s influence despite his de facto ownership is going to being diminished.’ Allyson Stewart-Allen, a director at International Marketing Partners, was reported as saying: ‘I think investors in America are needing to know if there is a capable leader, and some question now about whether James Murdoch is that capable a leader to run that enterprise. ‘The other question is the reassurance that advertisers aren’t going to flee the newspapers titles. In the worst case scenario should they flee then they need to kill the brands in the way the News of the World was anaesthetised or euthanised.’ Senator John McCain has criticised the decision for News Corp to be investigated in the U.S, telling Sky News it's a 'British issue that needs to be resolved first'. But Media consultant Robert Dilenschneider told Fox the scandal is being over-hyped and Mr Murdoch has 'done all the right things'.","Worked for tycoon since starting on the Adelaide News in 1960 .

Thousands greeted the players in mid-Manhattan in New York yesterday, about 24 hours after they had been defeated by Japan on spot kicks after the scores were locked at 2-2 following extra time at the Commerzbank Arena, Frankfurt.

Meanwhile in Tokyo thousands of joyous, flag-waving fans greeted the Japan women's soccer team as the players arrived home yesterday morning. Two fire trucks shot out celebratory arches of water over the team's plane as it approached the terminal at Tokyo's Narita Airport. Throngs of fans wearing the team's dark blue colours greeted the players as they made their way into the terminal. A nation reeling from months of tragedy, following the March earthquake, tsunami and the resulting nuclear fall-out at the Fukishima plant, has been united in joyous celebration after its team became the first from Asia to win the biggest prize in women's soccer. Prime Minister Naoto Kan called the victory the 'greatest gift' to the nation, especially to the residents of the northeast coast most devastated by the March 11 natural disasters. The twin disasters left nearly 23,000 people dead or missing and caused partial meltdowns at a nuclear power plant that added to the tragedy. Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa said the victory will encourage those working to help Japan bounce back. 'The team showed great perseverance and sent a good message toward recovery from the major disaster,' Mr Kitazawa said.","Final sparked most tweets per second (7,196) - more than Royal Wedding .

United Nations on Tuesday. He . promised the Libyan people that the world will stand with them as they . reshape their country following the fall of Moammar Gaddafi's regime. The . president warned that there would still be difficult days ahead in . Libya, as Gaddafi loyalists make a final stand and the country's . provisional leadership grapples with the complex task of setting up a . new government. Scroll down for video . Master of ceremonies: Obama addresses the meeting of the Libya Contact Group to talk about the tough months ahead . But Mr Obama said it was clear that Libya was now in the hands of the people. 'After decades of iron rule by one man, it will take time to build the institutions needed for a democratic Libya. 'I'm sure there will be days of frustration,' Obama said. 'But . if we have learned anything these many months, it is this — do not . underestimate the aspirations and will of the Libyan people.' 'Just . as the world stood by you in your struggle to be free, we will now . stand with you in your struggle to realize the peace and prosperity that . freedom can bring,' he said. The . Associated Press reports that Obama praised the international community . for having 'the courage and the collective will to act' in Libya. Solemn: The president's meeting with Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai was overshadowed by news of the death on Tuesday of former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani at the hands of a suicide bomber . Great to see YOU: Obama with Mustafa Abdel Jalil, president of Libya's National Transitional Council . He said that while global powers cannot and should not intervene every time there is an injustice in the world, there are occasions when nations must join forces to prevent the killing of innocent civilians. 'Our international coalition stopped the regime in its tracks and saved countless lives, and gave the Libyan people the time and space to prevail,' Mr Obama said. Mr Obama was joined at the meeting on Libya by several other world leaders and representatives of Libya's National Transitional Council. Prior to the gathering, Obama met one-on-one with the NTC's chairman, Mustafa Abdel Jalil.The U.S. now recognizes the NTC as Libya's legitimate government. Formal affair: Presidents Obama and Karzai sit at the head of the table while the rest of the party await to be seated . Mr Obama announced on Tuesday that the U.S. ambassador was heading back to Tripoli to lead a newly-reopened American embassy there. Mr Obama called on Jalil and other NTC leaders to ensure a timely democratic transition in Libya, including free and fair elections. While much of the focus is on Libya's political transition, serious security concerns remain. Small bands of Gaddafi supporters continue to fight in pockets around the country, and the longtime leader has yet to be captured. Mr Obama said the NATO-led bombing campaign in Libya will continue as long as civilians are threatened. And he urged Gadhafi loyalists to lay down their arms and join the new Libya, declaring, 'the old regime is over.' Pssst: Obama shares a quiet, humorous moment with French President Nicolas Sarkozy . Mr Obama's remarks on Libya opened the first of his two days of meetings at the U.N. General Assembly. Later Tuesday, Mr Obama was to shift his attention to Afghanistan, meeting with that country's leader, Hamid Karzai. It's the first time the two leaders have met in person since Obama announced plans to withdraw more than 30,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan by the end of next summer. Mr Obama and Mr Karzai's meeting also comes amid news that Afghanistan's former president was killed in Kabul on Tuesday by a suicide bomber. A Karzai spokesman said the Afghan president would cut short his trip to the U.S. after meeting with Obama, and fly back to Kabul. Mr Obama's withdrawal plan aims to put the Afghans on a path toward taking full control of their own security by the end of 2014. New boy in town: President Barack Obama meets with Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil on Tuesday morning . With U.S. troops expected to stay in Afghanistan well beyond 2014, Obama and Karzai's discussion will focus in part on negotiations over a broad security deal to provide a framework for long-term U.S. military and economic support for Afghanistan. The agreement, now in draft form, would give the U.S. use of Afghan-run or jointly run bases after 2014. U.S. officials stress that the U.S. military presence will be at Afghanistan's invitation. The two countries appear close to an agreement, but sticking points remain, such as who will control detention of suspected militants and leadership of counterterrorism raids that are unpopular with the Afghans. The U.S. has said any security agreement would not hold the legally binding force of a treaty, raising some questions over the enforceability of any pact. Looming over Obama's meetings Tuesday was an approaching clash over Palestinian statehood. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said despite being under 'tremendous pressure' to drop the effort, he plans to ask the U.N. Security Council to grant Palestinians full membership, a bid certain to be vetoed by the U.S. U.S. officials are insisting there is still time to avoid a divisive showdown, and have been reaching out to Western allies in hopes of a last-minute compromise. The Palestinian statehood bid is also a domestic concern for Mr Obama, who faces skepticism from some Jewish voters who believe he's anti-Israel. Congressional lawmakers from both parties are also threatening to cut off $500 million in economic and security assistance to the Palestinians if they move forward with the U.N. bid. Obama is also using his time in New York to raise money for his re-election bid. The president spoke at one fundraiser Monday night and was to speak at another on Tuesday evening, both to raise money for his campaign and for the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Obama will give his annual address to the U.N. on Wednesday. National security aides at the White House said the president would address the changes sweeping through Arab countries, the Israeli-Palestinian situation, and the troop reductions in Afghanistan and Iraq.","The world stands behind you, President tells Libya's new ruling party .

"By . Neil Sears . Last updated at 11:54 AM on 21st July 2011 . Convicted: Student Lucy Harris, pictured here with a male companion, who ran up thousands of pounds of bills on her mother's credit cards . She stole tens of thousands of pounds from her mother to fund lavish spending sprees and foreign holidays. Not content with that, Lucy Harris then targeted her elderly grandmother. But incredibly, the student still has her mother's support - although her pleas for leniency fell on deaf ears yesterday. A judge jailed Harris, 26, for nine months and said: 'It was the ultimate betrayal of a family.' He rejected a claim by Harris, a single mother of a seven-month-old boy, that she committed the crimes over five years to punish mother Wendy for keeping her in the dark when her father Stuart was dying of leukaemia in 2000. Her thefts totalled £38,000 - but she was thwarted in an attempt to gain £360,000 more by remortgaging the family home. The court heard that Harris was a talented student who won a place to study at Liverpool John Moores University. But she began using her mother’s HSBC bank card and credit card and Marks and Spencer’s store card without permission, and flew to New York,  Amsterdam,  Tenerife and Italy. She also used her  mother’s identity and funds for three holidays at Center Parcs, trips on North Sea ferries, stays in hotels, clothes and restaurant meals. Her tally on ten cards in her mother’s name reached £26,000, including £3,000 on phone bills, £3,000 on clothes and more on sofas, cosmetics and tickets to comedy shows. Astonishingly, for four years, her mother blamed herself and paid off the debts without taking further action. Last year, she reached the end of her tether and called the police – but she dropped the charges after her daughter promised to change. Within months, however, the fraudster turned to stealing from her grandmother, Ivy Harris, who lived in Beverley, East Yorkshire. Cash cow: Lucy Harris tried to remortgage her mother Wendy's house (pictured) in Stamford Bridge, East Yorkshire . By the time the elderly Mrs Harris found out, her granddaughter had run up bills of £12,000 in her name. Mrs Harris died within a week of discovering the betrayal. The student was also caught plotting to forge signatures so she could remortgage her mother’s home and raise more cash. Delusional: . Lucy Harris told her mother she had graduated from Liverpool's John . Moores University (pictured) with a first, but she hadn't even finished . her degree . The court also heard that Harris falsely told her mother she had graduated from her university with a first class degree, when she had not even completed her course. But despite all this, her mother sent a letter to Hull Crown Court to try to save her from jail after she pleaded guilty to 12 counts of fraud and asked for a further 150 to be taken into consideration. The mother, 60, of Stamford Bridge in East Yorkshire, wrote: ‘I want to beg you to show her mercy by not giving her a custodial sentence. I have forgiven her for her actions. ‘I feel they were a result of my husband’s death. She struggled to cope with the loss of a much-loved father. She realises she has ruined her life.’ But Judge Michael Mettyear told a weeping Harris, of Pocklington, East Yorkshire: ‘Over five years, you acted in a determined and deliberate way. You were thoroughly manipulative. ‘It was utterly despicable. You have been given chance after chance by your mother. ‘You threw it back in her face after she declined to continue with the police investigation and turned your attention to your grandmother, which was almost unimaginable. ‘I do not accept it was all down to the loss of your father. No doubt you were extremely upset, but this was determined dishonesty.’ Lavish: A flight to Tenerife (pictured) was among Lucy Harris's fraudulent purchases .","Lucy Harris, 26, jailed for nine months after lavish spending spree ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:19 PM on 21st September 2011 . President Barack Obama will today make a desperate push for the Palestinians to drop a statehood bid when he addresses the U.N. General Assembly today. Obama will follow up his speech with separate meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders as he seeks to coax both parties back to direct peace talks. But as U.S. officials attempt to steer Palestine away, unrest was growing in the West Bank today from residents calling for independence. President Barack Obama will try to talk Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas out of an official push for statehood . The talks come as several thousand Palestinians streamed into the center of this West Bank city today in a show of support for their president's bid to win U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state. The rally, in a small square in downtown Ramallah, was carefully orchestrated, with civil servants and schoolchildren given time off to participate. Crowds of youths hoisted Palestinians flags and chanted slogans calling for the establishment of an independent Palestine. At the same time, U.S. officials are . conceding that they probably cannot prevent Palestinian leader Mahmoud . Abbas from moving forward with a request to the U.N. Security Council . for full Palestinian membership. Recognizing that Abbas seems intent to . proceed, Obama is expected to privately ask the Palestinian leader to . essentially drop the move for statehood recognition after Abbas delivers . a formal letter of intent to the U.N. on Friday. Religious unrest: Palestinian demonstrators carry a slingshot and rocks past a burning trash bin during clashes with Israeli soldiers today . Violence: A Palestinian holds a slingshot as others roll tires to burn during clashes with Israeli soldiers, at the Qalandia checkpoint between the West Bank city of Ramallah and Jerusalem . 'The president will say, frankly, the same thing in private that he'll say in public, which is that we do not believe that this is the best course of action for achieving Palestinian aspirations,' White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said. Obama will also meet today with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Obama administration has pledged . to veto any Palestinian statehood bid, arguing that only direct peace . negotiations, not a U.N. vote, would allow the Palestinians to achieve . the benefits of statehood. With . peace talks stalled, the U.S. and international partners have been . negotiating intensely this week over the steps it would take to bring . the two sides back to the negotiating table. The new approach being considered would . see the 'quartet' of Mideast peace mediators - the U.S., European Union, . United Nations and Russia - issue a statement addressing both . Palestinian and Israeli concerns and setting a timetable for a return to . the long-stalled peace talks, officials close to the diplomatic talks . said. Talks: French President Nicolas Sarkozy, left, meets with Mr Abbas in New York during the 66th session of the General Assembly yesterday . Discussions: Mr Abbas (right) and his delegation sit with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (left) during a U.N. meeting earlier this week . Israel would have to accept its pre-1967 borders with land exchanges as the basis for a two-state solution, and the Palestinians would have to recognize Israel's Jewish character if they were to reach a deal quickly, officials close to the talks said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing diplomacy. The White House publicly appeared to hold out slight hope that enough progress could be made to stop Abbas from formally requesting statehood recognition. 'President Abbas has indicated his . determination to go to the Security Council, so we take him at his word . on that,' Rhodes said. Today's . march appeared subdued, with many people using the day off to mingle . and do some window shopping. While turnout was modest, participants said . the gathering sent an important message. 'We . want to live in dignity,' said Atallah Wahbeh, a 60-year-old . shopkeeper. He said it was important that the U.N. recognize the . Palestinian cause, even if there are repercussions, such as a possible . cut in American aid. 'We don't need the Americans to buy us with money,' he said. A new poll indicated there is overwhelming popular support for Abbas' recognition quest. Tense: Israeli border police walk past T-shirts with slogans calling for statehood recognition . Support: Palestinian children hold flags and posters during a rally for UN membership in the West Bank. The U.S. has threatened to veto the bid . Some 83 percent of Palestinians believe it's a good idea, even though nearly as many - 78 percent - say they expect it will make their daily lives more difficult, according to a new poll by the independent Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research. The survey, conducted last week, included 1,200 respondents and had an error margin of 3 percentage points.The U.N. bid is seen by many Palestinians as a last option, after two uprisings and two decades of negotiations with Israel failed to produce a state, said pollster Khalil Shikaki. ""It's simply a belief that the status quo is worse than the worst that can come out of the U.N.,"" he said. The simmering situation is far from the scenario Obama envisioned when he spoke at the U.N. one year ago. 'We should reach for what's best within ourselves,' Obama said last September in pushing for negotiated agreement on a sovereign Palestinian state. 'If we do, when we come back here next year, we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the United Nations.' While the Palestinian statehood bid has overshadowed Obama's time at the U.N., he is also expected to use his speech to the international body to reflect on the sweeping changes in the world over the past year, most notably in the Arab world. Rhodes said the president also would highlight significant foreign policy developments for the U.S., such as drawing down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the killing of Osama bin Laden. Obama on Wednesday also planned to hold bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. He was to meet with leaders from Britain, France, Japan and South Sudan, the world's newest nation.","Protesters gather in West Bank in support of Palestinian state .

"By . Fiona Roberts . Last updated at 2:11 PM on 16th July 2011 . A Mormon teenager will stand trial for allegedly helping her lover to kill his 16-year-old ex-girlfriend, a judge has ruled. Toni Fratto, 19, and Kody Patten, 18, are accused of hitting Micaela Costanzo over the head with a shovel, cutting her throat and then burying her body in a shallow grave just outside West Wendover, Nevada. Prosecutors claim the couple, who were planning to get married, murdered Micaela because she had been texting Patten asking to get back together with him. Love rivals: Toni Fratto, left, will stand trial for allegedly helping her boyfriend to murder his ex-girlfriend, Micaela Costanzo, right . After the killing the pair drove to a nearby swimming pool to 'clean up' - and then went to McDonald's, the court heard. Patten was charged just days after the murder in March, but Fratto was arrested more than a month later, after she allegedly confessed to Patten's father and his lawyer. On Thursday a judge ruled she, too, will now stand trial alongside her boyfriend on murder and kidnapping charges. In the taped confession, which Fratto's lawyer has dismissed as 'wholly rubbish', she told lawyers the couple had arranged to speak to Micaela after she sent Patten text messages asking to get back together. The pair had dated a couple of years previously, but had broken up before Patten and Fratto began their relationship. In January he was baptised as a Mormon so they couple could get married at the Temple. Charged: Kody Patten, 18, allegedly murdered his ex-girlfriend after a confrontation over text messages she had sent him . Fratto told lawyers Patten picked her and Micaela up and then drove out of town because Micaela, described as a popular student, 'didn't want anyone to see us or anything.' As they drove, Micaela became more and more agitated, according to Fratto. When they stopped, Micaela and Patten got out of the car to talk. The conversation soon descended into a shouting match, and the pair began shoving each other, Fratto claims. She told lawyers: 'I looked away, and then heard a loud thud on the car.' Fratto got out and saw the 16-year-old lying on the ground. She said: 'Everything from there on out was kind of a blur to me. It went downhill from there.' According to Fratto, they started 'freaking out' and they didn't know what to do. So she allegedly hit Micaela in the back with a shovel, and then together she and Patten cut the girl's throat, she said. Then they buried her body in a shallow grave and drove away. Fratto said they were both in shock, and asked themselves repeatedly: 'What did we just do? What do we do? We didn't know what we had just done.' Grisly end: Micaela's body was found in a shallow grave in the desert around five miles away from West Wendover High School, Nevada . According to Patten's father, Kip, Fratto told him the pair went to a local swimming pool to 'clean up' - and then went to McDonald's. But Fratto's defence lawyer claims that the recording wasn't credible, and parts of it were completely made-up. He claims some details of the confession did not tally with how Micaela was killed, and surveillance cameras at the school only show Patten, not Fratto. He also said Patten's father drove Fratto to his lawyer's office to make her confession when her parents were out of town, as he knew they didn't want her to speak to an attorney without them being present. Under cross-examination, Kip Patten testified: 'She said she wanted to come forward with it. She . didn't want Kody to pay for something they both participated in.' There is no forensic evidence linking Fratto to the murder, the court heard, . A two-day preliminary hearing for Patten is due to start on August 2.","Young couple 'drove to swimming pool to clean up after killing' - then went to McDonald's .

A student was arrested after telling police she made a false bomb threat so her class would be cancelled and she could study for a test. Alexxis C. Anthony, 19, of Lakeland, Florida, said she was involved in a bomb threat to Polk State College with her friend, Theron K. Brown Jr. Call: Alexxis C. Anthony, 19, of Lakeland, Florida, said she was involved in a bomb threat to Polk State College with friend Theron K. Brown Jr. Anthony told police she made the threat because she felt under pressure to keep her grades up because of a college scholarship. The incident on July 28 evacuated the college’s Lakeland campus and was one of three bomb threats made against it in July, reported The Ledger. But no explosive devices were found despite a threat that one would go off at 9:15am. Anthony was arrested on Tuesday. Police say they expect more arrests and charges to be made, with the other two threats coming from the same mobile phone. Brown's girlfriend Judeane Curry told investigators that he had called her on the morning of July 28 and said he wanted to make a bomb threat.

She told allegedly police he wanted to get her and Anthony out of school - but she dismissed his comment, reported The Ledger. The bomb threats earlier last month on July 6 and July 20 forced the college to shut down four campuses, including Lakeland. The first two threats were estimated to have cost the college more than $130,000 because of how many classes were cancelled. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said the investigation into the bomb threats is a ‘top priority’ because bomb threats ‘will not be tolerated’. Anthony faces a charge of falsely reporting a bomb threat and her bail was set at $15,750, reported The Ledger.","Alexxis Anthony says she was involved in bomb threat .

It’s a controversial court ruling in favour of Apple that could ultimately even lead to the ban of all Google Android phones and tablets in the U.S. Apple has won a preliminary ruling from a U.S. trade panel that Taiwanese handset maker HTC infringed on two of its patents. HTC uses Google's Android operating system for its smartphones and the case is being closely watched by the mobile devices market. Court battle: Apple, manufacturer of the iPhone 4, left, has won a preliminary ruling that HTC, which produces the Evo 4G, right, infringed on two of its patents . The preliminary ruling is already creating a buzz as it is one of the first between Apple and other smartphone makers using Android. The win could see Apple take on other Android handset makers or demand an import ban to the U.S. against HTC, reported The Guardian. The patents relate to data processing and cover actions such as the device recognising phone numbers and being prompted to call them. Apple is unhappy that Android contains a similar ‘analyser server’ for ‘detecting structures in the data’. VentureBeat reported patent expert Florian Mueller as saying: ‘I have looked at those patents before and they appear to be very fundamental. Wildfire device: HTC uses Google's Android operating system for its smartphones and the case is being closely watched by the mobile devices market . ‘They are very likely to be infringed by code that is at the core of Android. 'Those patents appear to be very fundamental. They are very likely to be infringed by code that is at the core of Android. This could in a worst-case scenario result in an import ban against many or even all Android-based HTC products in the U.S. market' Patent expert Florian Mueller . 'This could in a worst-case scenario result in an import ban against many or even all Android-based HTC products in the U.S. market.’ It follows a wealth of patent litigation between Apple and Samsung, which also uses the Android; Apple and Nokia; and Microsoft and Motorola. HTC says it will ‘vigorously fight’ the finding by an International Trade Commission judge last week, but the full commission is yet to make a decision. Android-based smartphones have outpaced iPhones globally but Apple is expected to launch a new iPhone this year and give itself a big boost. Preliminary victory: The win could see Apple take on other Android handset makers or demand an import ban to the U.S. against HTC this year . Apple initially accused HTC of infringing 10 patents but six were dropped from the case and the ITC judge ruled that HTC infringed two of the remaining four. ‘We are confident we have a strong case for the ITC appeals process and are fully prepared to defend ourselves using all means possible' HTC spokesman Grace Lei . A final determination in the case is due on December 6. Apple filed a parallel lawsuit against HTC in a court in Delaware. ‘We are confident we have a strong case for the ITC appeals process,’ HTC General Counsel Grace Lei said. ‘(We) are fully prepared to defend ourselves using all means possible.’ Shares in HTC tumbled as much as 6.5 per cent on Monday, with its announcement of a share buyback failing to stem the fall.","Preliminary patent court ruling in Apple v HTC case .

"By . John Stevens . Last updated at 12:58 PM on 7th July 2011 . As Casey Anthony looks forward to being released from jail today, shocking letters reveal that the 25-year-old has plans to have more children. In jailhouse letters, Anthony told how she has dreamt of being pregnant again and is considering adopting as there are 'so many children that deserve to be loved'. The Orlando woman, who was stunningly acquitted of the murder of her two-year-old daughter Caylee, has plans to write a book, which she describes a memoir and relationship advice book. Shocking letters: Casey Anthony revealed that she wants to be a mother again in jailhouse correspondence . The prisoner, who has spent nearly three years inside, also revealed how she is looking forward to having her teeth whitened, being able to wear sexy underwear and becoming 'a part of society' again after her release. Last night Jose Baez gave his first interview since the Casey Anthony verdict. Speaking to Barbara Walters, Mr Baez called Casey an 'extremely intelligent, kind warm hearted individual.' He recounted how 'The happiest moment came after the first not guilty verdict - I knew I had saved her life.' When asked whether Casey was a good mother, Mr Baez became cagey, adding: 'I think that came out in the trial'. Confident in his case Mr Baez said: 'This was not a murder case, it never was.' Continuing to defend Casey he spoke of how the media and spectators had vilified his client. He said: 'They think she is a monster they think she is a cold hearted killer - nothing can be further from the truth.' But he went on to admit Casey was, 'someone with serious issues.' He concluded by excusing Casey's bizarre  behaviour, pointing to her past. He said: 'When you look at the life she had before this ever happened...within her family and within her self,' that it was no wonder how she turned out. Anthony will today be sentence by Judge Belvin Perry for the four minor counts of lying to law enforcement, which were the only charges on which the jury found her guilty. She is expected to walk free from the hearing as the maximum penalty she faces is four years in prison, and she has already served nearly three. On release, she will have no restrictions stopping her from capitalising on the case by signing movie or book deals or selling interviews. 'I had a dream not too long ago that I was pregnant,' wrote Anthony in one of more than 50 letters sent to fellow inmate Robyn Adams, which have been released. 'It was like having Cays all over again,' she wrote, referring to daughter Caylee. 'I've thought about adopting, which even sounds weird to me saying it, but there are so many children that deserve to be loved.' In another letter to her fellow . inmate in the Orlando County Jail, she wrote: 'Let's make a deal? Let's . get pregnant together? If it's really possible to plan it.' The . handwritten letters, which were written between 2008 and 2009, give a . fascinating insight into what Anthony will do on release from prison. In . one letter Anthony told how she has plans to write what she describes . as a 'partial memoir/comedy/relationship advice book for those not in . the know'. Getting ready for release: Casey Anthony could be freed from jail tomorrow morning at her sentencing . 'It's a way to settle many rumors and to share my insight about love, life and most important - God,' she added. 'Who knows.' The 25-year-old also made references to starting a business. She wrote: 'When are we going to sit on the beach, drinking cocktails and planning our future business?' Perhaps surprisingly, the prisoner also wrote that she wants to give money to charity. Sentencing: Judge Belvin Perry could decide to release Casey Anthony at the hearing in Orlando tomorrow at 9am . Dead: Anthony wrote that she had a dream in which she was pregnant. She said it felt like when she had Caylee . 'I want to donate money to charities? Leukemia [sic] research, breast cancer, cervical cancer,' she wrote. The letters give extensive detail of what Anthony misses the most about life outside prison and what she is looking forward to doing on release. 'I can't wait to get my teeth whitened and to use my regular toothbrush/toothpaste/shampoo, conditioner,' she wrote. 'I still have no desire to wear heels unless the occasion calls for it. But Converse, boots and REAL flipflops? Ah! And hats, regular ball caps.' 'Sunglasses. Underwear, that fits!' she added to the list. 'Is that vain? Should I not look forward to these things?' Anthony also wrote how she is looking forward to being able to treat herself to manicures and pedicures on trips to the beauty salon. 'Color on my toesies and acrylic nails - yes please,' she wrote. 'I want to embrace the many joys of being a lady.' 'And girl, I could use a day at Target myself,' she continued. 'Just to walk around the store, to be a part of society. I want to go grocery shopping.' The jury's decision led to outrage across America, leading to fears for her safety when she is released from prison. But the letter reveal that Anthony has already been thinking about creating a new identity. 'If you could change your name to any name, what would it be?' she wrote in one letter.

The report raises questions about the honesty of former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and Andy Hayman, who oversaw the original 2006 police probe of the newspaper. The development came before David Cameron made an emergency statement on the scandal to the House of Commons. He faced questions from MPs about his party's links to phone hacking suspect Neil Wallis. The Prime Minister arrived home from a . shortened trip to Africa last night as it was revealed that his . communications chief Andy Coulson, had been advised by Mr . Wallis in the run-up to the general election. In . a further extraordinary development, Labour MP Chris Bryant today . hinted that the Queen may have told Mr Cameron not to hire Mr Coulson. Mr Bryant told the BBC: 'Very senior . people at Buckingham Palace were very troubled by the appointment of . Andy Coulson and tried to make it absolutely clear to the Prime . Minister. 'I am not sure whether this information ever got directly to the Prime . Minister, but it certainly got to senior figures at Downing Street. 'The Queen's grandchildren had their phones hacked. And quite probably . other members of the Royal Household ... I think it would be perfectly . natural for very senior members of the Royal Family to be very troubled . about the appointment. 'After all, Andy Coulson was the editor of the . News of the World when the royal princes' phones were hacked. That is . not in dispute. Morning after the night before: Rupert Murdoch left his house today reading the front page of his paper The Times which covers his appearance at the Commons select committee . 'And Andy Coulson resigned from the News of the . World expressly because of the hacking of the royal princes' phones.' Mr Bryant did not name the Queen directly. His claim prompted a furious denial from Downing Street. A No 10 source said the allegation was 'scurrilous' and 'complete rubbish'. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt leaves the House of Commons after Rupert Murdoch and his son James gave evidence. Today he defended the Prime Minister's handling of the scandal . In his statement Mr . Cameron will announce the names of the panel that will . look at press regulation and the final terms of reference for the . judge-led inquiry into claims about phone hacking and illegal payments . to police. But, after the Murdochs, Rebekah Brooks and senior police . officers were grilled in an extraordinary series of Commons committee . hearings, the Prime Minister will now be in the firing line. Aides . have indicated that he expects to be questioned by MPs on the admission . last night that Coulson, ex-News of the World editor, was received help . from Wallis, former deputy editor at the same newspaper. Both men have . been arrested and bailed in connection with the Scotland Yard hacking . inquiry. A senior Cabinet minister defended Mr  Cameron's handling of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal today as the Prime Minister prepared to face a barrage of MPs' questions over his role in the affair. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt denied that the continuing political firestorm represented the biggest crisis of Mr Cameron's premiership so far. But he acknowledged that the Prime Minister needed to demonstrate he was capable of the leadership needed to sort out the crisis which has rocked politicians, police and the media. He said Mr Cameron 'didn't have a crystal ball"" but has made big decisions 'to sort this out'. He told BBC Breakfast: 'What we've seen is that he's recalled Parliament, he's got an independent police inquiry, he's got an independent judge-led inquiry, he's published all the meetings he's had with media owners and said in the future ministers will publish all the meetings that they have with media proprietors, so he's done more in a couple of weeks than I think any other prime minister has done in a couple of decades and I think that is the key judgment call that the people of Britain will be looking for him to make.' Mr Hunt added the Murdochs' committee hearing had shown that 'so much wrongdoing seemed to happen without the knowledge of the people at the top'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'But it does seem like a huge amount was going wrong in that organisation and no one felt it necessary to tell the person at the top, and I think that was something that will have worried a lot of people.' The report raises issues about the honesty of former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, left. It also said the conduct of former assistant Met commissioner Andy Hayman, right, during the investigation and 'during our evidence session was both unprofessional and inappropriate’ Scotland Yard's current communications chief Dick Fedorcio, left, was also criticised for apparently showing 'no due diligence' in conducting proper checks on Neil Wallis, right, the ex-News of the World deputy editor . The Conservatives disclosed yesterday . that former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis had given . informal advice to Andy Coulson when he was Mr Cameron's communications . director in the run-up to the general election. The role of Mr Wallis - who was . arrested last week by police investigating the phone-hacking allegations . - was already under scrutiny after it was disclosed that he had been . working for Scotland Yard as a part-time PR consultant. In a further twist, Downing Street . released emails yesterday showing that Mr Cameron's chief of staff Ed . Llewellyn had prevented senior police officers briefing Mr Cameron on . the phone-hacking investigation. He wrote to Assistant Commissioner . John Yates telling him 'we will want to be able to be entirely clear, . for your sake and ours, that we have not been in contact with you about . this subject'. Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell . ruled last night that Mr Llewellyn had acted 'entirely properly' but the . disclosure is likely to increase the pressure on the Prime Minister. He is already facing demands to . apologise for appointing Mr Coulson after he quit as News of the World . editor in 2007 after royal reporter Clive Goodman and private . investigator Glenn Mulcaire were jailed for hacking the phones of royal . aides. The Home Affairs Select Committee said in its withering assessment today: ‘We deplore the response of News International to the original investigation into hacking. ‘It is almost impossible to escape . the conclusion that they were deliberately trying to thwart a criminal . investigation. We are astounded at the length of time it has taken for . News International to co-operate with the police.’ The . report points out that Mrs Brooks’s denial of knowledge of phone . hacking ‘is limited to her time as editor of News of the World’, a small . part of her career in News International. Holding hands, Rupert Murdoch and his wife Wendi leave Parliament after yesterday's hearing . And . it also raises concerns about her knowledge of illegal payments to . corrupt police officers. ‘She did not say that she had no knowledge of . specific payments but that she had not intended to give the impression . that she had knowledge of specific cases,’ the MPs conclude. The committee condemns the police, . singling out former assistant Met commissioner Mr Hayman,  criticising . his handling of the case, his social contacts with News International . executives and his decision to take a job with the firm after leaving . the police. It said: . ‘Mr Hayman’s conduct during the investigation and during our evidence . session was both unprofessional and inappropriate.’ There was also criticism in the . report for Dick Fedorcio, Scotland Yard's current communications chief, . for apparently showing 'no due diligence' in conducting proper checks on . Neil Wallis. Mr Wallis, . an ex-News of the World executive, was employed by the Met in 2009 and . was last week questioned about phone hacking allegations. The committee said it was . 'particularly shocked' by Mr Fedorcio's approach to hiring Wallis and . said he tried to deflect blame on to Mr Yates. MPs called for extra funding to support Operation Weeting, saying it would take years to inform all potential victims without it. They praised Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers' decision to contact all potential victims of phone hacking by the News of the World. But they said they were 'alarmed' that only 170 had have so far been informed, adding that 'up to 12,800 people may have been affected.' David Cameron chats to a mother about her twins during a visit yesterday to an immunisation clinic in Lagos, Nigeria. The Prime Minister cut short his visit to Africa so he could make a statement to the House of Commons today . ● Police officers will be jailed for accepting cash bribes from News of the World journalists, MPs were told yesterday. The newspaper is alleged to have paid tens of thousands of pounds to officers who supplied information. Asked by MPs on a parliamentary committee if any officers would go to prison, the outgoing assistant  commissioner of the Met Police, John Yates, replied: ‘If the corruption cases, which are very small in number, are properly investigated, I have no doubt.’ Mr Yates resigned from the force on Monday after he was told he faced suspension over his links to the newspaper.","MPs 'deplore' News International response to original hacking probe .

La Liga's Getafe has struggled in recent years to fill its 17,000 seater Madrid stadium, with one of the lowest attendance records in the division. And so bosses have come up with a novel plan to populate their Coliseum Alfonso Pérez - by encouraging fans to watch a club-produced erotic movie whilst at sperm donation clinics. Scroll down to see the advert... Enticing: These zombies star in a film which is trying to boost the fan base of Madrid football club Getafe . They hope their passion will transfer to produce a plethora of supporters which will prop up the club for years to come. 'We are few and we have to be more. We have to move a mass of fans to seed the world with Getafe supporters,' said the film's creator Angel Torres. But rather than being a seedy sideline for the football club, Zombies Calientes del Getafe (Hot Zombies of Getafe) is in fact part of a new publicity campaign to try and boost its fan base. The advert, which has appeared on Spanish national television, tells the story of a Getafe sperm donor who, when he gets to the clinic, is given the filthy film. At the start of the film, this Getafe supporter is seen looking around the Madrid club's empty stadium . 'This shows us a problem: We are few' - says the video trying to get more supporters for Getafe . 'The solution is simple,' the narrator says. 'It's within you. We talk about donating sperm. The more donors, the better. 'To make sure we get the best supporter, we have made the first Getafe porn movie.' It cuts to half-naked zombies rolling around on beds who say how important it is to get Getafe back on track. The footage then goes back to the donor who, with a steely determination, marches down a corridor with fellow fans, into an individual cubicle, to complete his mission. The solution is simple: Getafe says it has 'made' its own erotic movie to make sure donors produce supporters . Struggling: Getafe have found it difficult to fill its Coliseum Alfonso Perez in recent years . Tussle: Real Madrid's Ricardo Carvalho duels with Getafe's Nicolas Fedor Miku during a La Liga match in May 2011 .

He said the controversial advert had received a 'largely positive' response and that season ticket sales had soared to 9,000 since its broadcast. Creator Angel Torres added: 'We wanted to relay reality, because we all come to the stadium when we can, and it's true that there are many season ticket holders but it's never full.' It is not the first time Getafe have resorted to viral marketing in a bid to boost its fan base. In 2009 Burger King's new sponsorship deal with the side saw the  chain's logo splashed on the front of their shirts and a picture of the 'Burger King' on the inside, too. It meant goalscorers could wear a mask during elaborate celebrations - Ravanelli-style. Getafe's stadium is the third largest in the Spanish capital.

But President Obama appeared flustered and uncomfortable as he was confronted by angry Tea Party activists as he kicked off his make-or-break bus tour last night. A beleaguered Mr Obama is trying to counter a massive in drop in popularity as a Gallup poll shows his approval rating has slumped to a record low of below 40 per cent. Scroll down for video . Ryan Rhodes, right, clashed with the President at a town hall meeting in Iowa, yesterday . As the President appeared at an . open-air town hall meeting in Iowa yesterday, one Tea Party activist . shouted that he was unhappy about Joe Biden allegedly calling the . right-wing group 'terrorists'. Ryan Rhodes called for more civility . from the administration, saying: 'Your Vice President is calling people . like me, a Tea Party member, a . “terrorist”.’ Mr Rhodes . was referring to media reports that Vice President Joe Biden had made . the remark at a private meeting on debt with House of Representatives . Democrats earlier this month. As Mr Rhodes and another activist . further questioned the President after the meeting, he stammered his . answers while trying to continue to shake the hands of more supportive . people at the event. During the meeting, Mr Obama had responded: ‘I absolutely agree . that everybody needs to try to tone down the rhetoric.

Obama today embraces a woman who said it was her birthday . An specially built armoured bus has been bought to be used by the President to use during the 2012 election campaign. The bus costing at least $1.1 million is being used by Mr Obama as he travels across the Midwest. The Secret Service has paid $2.2 million for two buses that will be used by the President and Republican candidates, but the cost is likely to be much higher because of extra security features added after manufacture. Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said: 'We've been overdue for having this asset in our protective fleet for some time. 'We've been protecting presidential candidates and vice presidential candidates all the way back to the 1980s using buses during bus tours.' 'They're certainly going to be used for bus tours around the country,' as well as other events, he added. 'When protectees go to remote areas, go camping or on a motorcycle trip, we'll bring the asset out as a mobile security facility,' he told Politico. 'In fairness, . since I have been called a socialist who wasn’t born in this country, . who is destroying America and taking away its freedoms because I passed a . health care bill, I am all for lowering the rhetoric.’ Today, on the second day of the three-day bus tour, Mr Obama is spending time promoting rural economic policies, among the series of remedies he is pushing to fire up job growth. The President began with an early morning workout at a Decorah gym and later chatted with a few locals outside his hotel before getting on the bus to his next event, a White House Rural Economic Forum at Northeast Iowa Community College in Peosta. As . the tour kicked off, Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney . attacked Barack Obama, calling the trip around Midwestern states a . 'Magical Misery Tour'. The . comment, which refers to the Beatles iconic 1967 album 'Magical Mystery . Tour', is a continuation of the GOP frontrunner's unrelenting attack on . Obama - a strategy he has pursued at the expense of criticising his . Republican rivals. A statement released by the Romney . camp said: 'During his Magical Misery bus tour this week, it is unlikely . President Obama will speak with unemployed Americans, to near-bankrupt . business owners, or to families struggling to survive in this economy. 'He . is more interested in campaigning in swing states than working to solve . the economic crisis that is crushing the middle class. 'Turning this economy around will . require real leadership and the experience of someone who has actually . worked in the private sector.'

It . comes after a summer spent fighting politicians in Washington over the . nation's debt crisis - and a day after two 'fast-rising' Republicans . were mobbed at a fundraiser in Iowa - where Obama will make his first . stop. Obama will have the chance to absorb . the public's anger and do his best to give optimistic answers as he . travels between town hall stops. And . with unemployment standing above nine per cent, the country feeling the . deep pinch of a stunted recovery and suffering the humiliation of a . major debt agency lowering its credit rating, it seems he will have a . lot to talk about. His aides have revealed he is unlikely to engage any of his potential Republican rivals by name. But, with his poll rating falling, he . intends to draw sharp contrasts between his ideas on the economy and . the Republican approach. He has dismissed that as little more . than slashing spending on vital programs like education and Medicare, . the programme that provides health care for the poor. Sources also said that he was ready . to hear complaints from disaffected Democrats tired of his compromises . with Republicans, and from a public disgusted with a dysfunctional . Washington.

But it is now where Republicans have been blanketing the state in preparation for its first-in-the-nation caucuses.

David Cameron will tonight fly into the greatest crisis of his premiership as the phone hacking affair forces him to cut short a trip to Africa. The Prime Minister insisted there was no comparison between his hiring of ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson as his media chief and Met Police boss Sir Paul Stephenson’s employment of his deputy, Neil Wallis. But Sir Paul’s resignation on Sunday night – with a bitter parting shot at the Prime Minister over Mr Coulson – sent shockwaves through the Government. London Mayor Boris Johnson – seen as a . potential rival for the Prime Minister’s job – infuriated Downing . Street by refusing to say whether or not Mr Cameron should consider . resigning too. And in a . sign of jitters on Mr Cameron’s own benches, Conservative MP John Baron . said hiring Mr Coulson might have been ‘an own goal’. Deputy . Prime Minister Nick Clegg had to take to the airwaves to insist: ‘I . don’t think that this is about the Prime Minister’s position, absolutely . not. Let’s keep this in perspective.’ The . Prime Minister has shortened the length of what was supposed to be a . five-day trip to Africa for the second time and will now return to . Britain tonight. Some Tory MPs warned privately that . Mr Cameron’s absence looked like he was failing to get a grip on the . crisis – or worse. One said: It looks like the PM is fleeing the . country.’ The Prime Minister has also agreed . that Parliament, which had been due to rise for its summer break . tonight, should sit tomorrow. Mr Cameron will make a statement on . the latest developments in the scandal and give MPs details of the . judge-led inquiry into press standards, phone hacking and police . corruption. Yesterday he attempted to shift . attention back on to the police by warning there were now some ‘very big . questions about potential police corruption’. Rupert Murdoch and his eldest son Lachlan are driven away from the media mogul's London home this morning. This afternoon Rupert and his son James will face MPs during a select committee meeting in Parliament . Meet and greet: Mr Cameron chats with a mother and twins Mubarak and Mubarakat today at a British government-funded vaccine and immunisation clinic in Lagos, Nigeria, ahead of his return to the UK . Mr Cameron speaks with Archbishop Desmond Tutu during a visit to Liliesleaf in Johannesburg, South Africa . In an event at the Johannesburg Stock . Exchange in South Africa, he sidestepped a question about whether he . had considered his own position in recent days, saying: ‘The British . government, in terms of the phone hacking scandal, has taken all of the . appropriate actions. ‘We . have set up a judicial inquiry, we have made sure there is a properly . funded police investigation, we have published huge amounts of . information about any meetings between politicians and senior media . executives. Ed Miliband was accused of using Milly Dowler’s family as a political football yesterday as he attacked David Cameron over the phone hacking scandal. Listeners criticised the Labour leader after he repeatedly made reference to the murdered schoolgirl in a speech broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live. One sent a message saying: ‘I find the politicisation of the Dowler family sickening. They have suffered enough and don’t need to be used as a political football in this shameless way.’ After reading out a series of similar messages, presenter Eleanor Oldroyd said: ‘Pretty much all the texts we’ve had are in this vein.’ ‘I feel I have been out there in . Parliament, in press conferences fully answering the questions, fully . transparent, very clear about what needs to be done – making sure that . Britain gets to the bottom of what has been a terrible episode in terms . of what newspapers have done, and also some very big questions about . potential police corruption. We need to get to the bottom of those.’ Mr Cameron insisted the cases of Mr . Coulson and Mr Wallis, the former deputy editor of the News of the . World, were ‘really quite different’. Mr Coulson quit the newspaper in 2007 . after one of its reporters was jailed for phone hacking. He insists he . had no knowledge of the practice. He resigned as Mr Cameron’s media . chief in January because of continuing media coverage, and was arrested . earlier this month over alleged hacking. A poll today suggests the public is . largely unmoved by the scandal. The ICM survey for The Guardian shows . the Conservatives moving into a narrow lead over Labour. It . puts the Conservatives on 37 per cent, unchanged in a month, Labour . down three points on 36 per cent and the Lib Dems up four on 16 per . cent, their highest rating since March. Labour leader Ed Miliband yesterday . came close to suggesting the Prime Minister should consider his . position, saying he must ‘face up’ to the consequences of his decision . to hire Mr Coulson. Graphic showing the key players in News International and timeline of arrests made by police. It emerged yesterday Mrs Elston will face no further action and has been dropped from the inquiry. ‘Sir . Paul Stephenson has taken responsibility and resigned over the hiring of . Mr Coulson’s deputy while the prime minister has not even apologised . for the hiring of Mr Coulson,’ Mr Miliband said. Labour also highlighted Sir Paul’s claim . that he had not told the Prime Minister about his employment of Mr . Wallis because he might somehow be ‘compromised’ because of his . association with Mr Coulson. In the Commons, Home Secretary Theresa May accused Labour of desperate ‘opportunism’. She said: ‘Of course there is difference between the Met and the Government. The Metropolitan Police were investigating allegations of wrongdoing at the News of the World. It is absolutely right there should be a line between the investigators and the investigated.’ But veteran Labour backbencher Sir Gerald Kaufman called on Mr Cameron to ‘consider his position’. And Labour left-winger Dennis Skinner demanded Mr Cameron’s resignation.  Mr Johnson gave Mr Cameron only lukewarm support at a press conference following the resignation of the Met assistant commissioner John Yates. He said: ‘I’m not here to discuss government appointments, I’m here to talk about events in the Metropolitan police service. Those questions you must direct to government.’ The Prime Minister is also under pressure to say whether he sought Civil Service advice before meeting James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks at Christmas in the middle of the now-abandoned News Corporation bid for BSkyB. Last night Downing Street disclosed a further meeting between Mrs Brooks and Mr Cameron at his birthday party. The encounter had been omitted from what was intended to be a complete list of Mr Cameron’s meetings with senior newspaper executives.","Ex NotW reporter who launched entire phone hacking scandal found dead .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 4:43 PM on 22nd September 2011 . A young American ballet star has become the first foreign dancer to become a 'premier' with the famed Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow. David Hallberg, who will also remain a principal with the New York-based American Ballet Theatre, received the distinction earlier this year. Until now, foreign dancers were only invited for guest stints and traditionally it has been stars from Moscow who move to the U.S. So harsh was the political climate, even those dancers that fled the Soviet Union were said to have faced death warrants ordered by the KGB. Stunning moves: David Hallberg leaps across the stage during the American Ballet Theatre's production of The Bright Stream. The 29-year-old has won a place at the prestigious Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow . But in an interview, Hallberg, from South Dakota, made it clear he fully grasps the significance of his move. 'It's a milestone,' the 29-year-old said by telephone during a break in rehearsals for an upcoming tour. 'It's historic. It's a huge challenge, but I feel it's important, not just for me as an artist, but for the dance world - and, in the bigger picture, maybe even for international relations.' Historically, some of the finest dancers from eastern Europe have moved to the U.S. Rudolf . Nureyev defected to the West in 1961 and Mikhail Baryshnikov in 1974 - . both great dancers who fled the Soviet Union for freedom and better . opportunities. Legendary Russin ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev performs a similar move to David while in rehearsals alongside Zizi Jeanmarie . The leader of the Societ Union, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, attempted to keep Nureyev in the country and a KGB death warrant is said to have been ordered for him. But Hallberg's reverse move shows how much the world has changed. Hallberg, at 29, is already regarded as one of the most talented male ballet dancers in the world. In six years as a principal with ABT, he has captivated audiences with his pure, elegant form, weightless jumps, regal bearing and tall, blond good looks. He performs in modern as well as classical pieces, but is especially suited to princely roles such as Siegfried in Swan Lake, Albrecht in Giselle or Romeo. First approached by the Bolshoi in April, . while performing in Moscow, Hallberg said his decision took time and . was extremely difficult. East to West: From left, Rudolf Nureyev, who defected from the Soviet Union to the West in 1961, and Mikhail Baryshnikov, also from Russia, who defected to Canada in 1974. Poise: Nureyev, who died in 1993, performs alongside Merle Parke at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden . 'It was really hard because the responsibility is really great; there's a responsibility to really do this justice,' he said. 'I by no means want to compare this to the weight of the defections of Misha (Baryshnikov) and Nureyev. I wasn't even around yet. I can't imagine what it was like for them.' But, he added: 'There is a correlation. This is about the globalisation of the world, and the globalisation of dance in particular.' Hallberg said he will split his time between the two companies, living both in New York and in Moscow. In a statement, the Bolshoi hailed its newest 'premier', or principal. 'Mr Hallberg ... possesses all the best qualities of classical dancer - perfect technique, refined manners and outstanding acting abilities,' said artistic director Sergei Fillin. Hallberg's first appearance with the Bolshoi is expected to be Giselle, with the young Bolshoi sensation Natalia Osipova as his partner. The two won raves when they performed the ballet together at the New York based ABT. 'We have a special connection,' Hallberg added.","As 'premier' at the ballet David Hallberg, 29, will perform with world's best .

London Ambulance spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that we were called at . 2.02pm today to reports of a fire on Abbey Street, SE1. Wrecked: The house in London Colney, burnt out after a lightning strike, home to Phil and Hazel McLaughlin . ‘We sent a duty manager, an ambulance crew and two hazardous area response team units. ‘At present our staff are treating a woman on the scene for minor smoke inhalation.’ Tom Langham, who works at Hackbridge Primary School in Sutton, south London, was hit by a bolt at around 1.45pm.

After an air traffic control tower was struck by lightning at Gatwick West Sussex, departing flights were suspended for half an hour. The incident, at around 2pm, led to the temporary failure of some ground-based systems,  although no one was hurt and there was no structural damage. An airport spokeswoman said: 'Planes are able to leave but on a restricted basis. We are advising passengers that there may be some delays.' And as high temperatures gave way to storms this afternoon, train services were hit by lightning strikes affecting signals. The weather phenomenon meant delays of up to 90 minutes on services in the Welwyn Garden City and Hertford North areas of Hertfordshire.

There were also delays of up to 90 minutes on services to the west of London after a lightning strike affected signalling in Southall. Passengers travelling on Heathrow Express trains to the airport were among those whose journeys were disrupted. Another lightning strike was at signalling at Petersfield in Hampshire. This led to 45-minute delays to South West Trains' services between Guildford in Surrey and Portsmouth Harbour. An Environment Agency spokesman said: ‘Staff are on 24-hour alert and teams are monitoring river levels as the band of rain moves across the country.’ However, the rain is expected to ease off today, with a drier outlook for tomorrow and Friday.

Ordeal: Shoshana Hebshi was arrested and led off a Denver to Detroit flight in handcuffs after other passengers reported her and two men sat next to her of 'suspicious' behaviour . A housewife spoke today of the terrifying moment she was arrested at gunpoint on a flight after other passengers reported her as being 'suspicious'. Shoshana Hebshi, who describes herself as 'half-Arab, half Jewish', was on board a plane between Denver and Detroit on Sunday when she was arrested along with two other passengers after a security scare. But she was completely unaware she had been singled out, along with two Indian men sitting in her row - none of whom knew each other - before an armed SWAT team stormed on to the plane. At the time, she had just sent a Tweet on her mobile phone saying '(c)ops in uniform and plainclothes huddle in rear of plane'. Another . passenger had reported the two men as being 'suspicious', apparently . after they got up to go to the bathroom in succession. Mrs Hebshi said: 'Someone shouted for us to place our hands on the seats in front of us, heads down. 'The cops ran down the aisle, stopped at my row and yelled at us to get up. 'One of the cops, grabbing my arm a little harder than I would have liked. He slapped metal cuffs on my wrists and pushed me off the plane. 'The three of us, two Indian men living in the Detroit metro area, and me, a half-Arab, half-Jewish housewife living in suburban Ohio, were being detained.' In shock, she was held in small cell, strip-searched and then questioned by FBI agents. 'They had done some background check on me already because they knew I had been to Venezuela in 2001. 'Suspicious': Passengers are led off the Frontier Airlines plane at Detroit Metropolitan Airport after it was stormed by armed officers on Sunday . Security checks: A group of police officers and agents examine the plane on the tarmac after the SWAT team had swooped on Ms Hebshi . 'They asked about my brother and my sister and asked about my foreign travel. They asked about my education and wanted my address, Social Security, phone number, Facebook, Twitter, pretty much my whole life story. High alert: A heavily armed police officer stands guard on Broadway Avenue, New York, during the 9/11 memorial on Sunday . 'I asked what was going on, and the man said judging from their line of questioning that I could probably guess, but that someone on the plane had reported that the three of us in row 12 were conducting suspicious activity. 'What is the likelihood that two Indian men who didn't know each other and a dark-skinned woman of Arab/Jewish heritage would be on the same flight from Denver to Detroit? Was that suspicion enough? 'Even considering that we didn't say a word to each other until it became clear there were cops following our plane?' Mrs Hebshi was later released without charge, along with the two men. But initial media reports claimed she and one of the other passengers had been 'making out' during the flight. Frontier Flight 623, which had 116 passengers on board, landed without incident in Detroit at 3.30pm on Sunday - the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. Security was already on high alert as memorials took place in the cities and the FBI released information on a credible but unconfirmed terror threat. FBI Detroit spokeswoman Sandra Berchtold said ultimately authorities determined there was no real threat on the Denver to Detroit flight. 'Due to the anniversary of Sept. 11, all precautions were taken, and any slight inconsistency was taken seriously, Ms Berchtold said. 'The public would rather us err on the side of caution than not.' Mrs Hebshi has since vowed not to fly again on September 11.

"By . Debbie Emery . Last updated at 8:03 PM on 17th September 2011 . White House gatecrasher and reality TV star Tareq Salahi has filed for divorce today citing adultery and abandonment. His wife, Real Housewives of D.C star MIchaele, ran off with Journey guitarist Neal Schon earlier this week. And in bizarre twist, Tareq claims his love rival taunted him with a lewd picture. In legal documents obtained by TMZ today, he alleged: 'The paramour [Neal] sent to my email account... a email with an attachment of a penis.' From the archives: Journey guitarist Neal Schon (far left) with Tarq and Michaele Salahi in an undated picture. The blonde reality TV star has left her husband for the rocker . Tareq claims his wife has been having an affair for 'several months', adding: 'She continually exposes our friends and acquaintances to her adulterous relationship and has flaunted the same throughout the community, the nation and indeed the world, and thus caused me to suffer great harm, humiliation and embarrassment.' The pair are understood to have a pre-nuptial agreement. Tareq was once friendly with the rocker and his band Journey, however he has now been banned from gaining access to the group's tour. An unearthed photograph shows the love rivals arm-in-arm, as . Michaele smiles slyly on the other side of them. It was taken after one of the band's concerts. Mrs Salahi first met Schon on 1995 and the pair felt an instant attraction, reported U.S. website TMZ. They allegedly embarked on a sexual affair as early as in 2009, which the Journey musician even bragged about to friends via e-mail. A second photo predicts the . direction that their friendship was destined to take, as Michaele, 45, . sits comfortably on her future lover's knee with his arms wrapped . tightly around her. 'Illicit affair': Salahi is seen here getting comfortable on Schon's knee. The pair reportedly met in 1995 and the relationship became sexual in 2009 . After allegedly hiding the affair for two years, the illicit couple threw caution to the wind earlier this week as Michaele jumped ship from her marriage into the Schon's arms - and onto the Journey tour bus. Gatecrashers: Tareq and Michaele Salahi sky-rocketed to infamy in November 2009 when they sneaked through security at a White House dinner and met President Barack Obama . A confused Tareq reported his wife missing after she didn't return from a hair appointment and a dance class, and even alerted the alarm that she had been kidnapped. But deputies at the local authorities told Tareq that his wife had previously contacted them to inform them that she was okay. She had told them she was 'dealing with family issues and was safe.' However, it soon emerged that Mrs Salahi was with Schon after going to his show in Nashville. The reality star is now said to be in Memphis with Schon as he continues his U.S tour. 'Mrs. Salahi said she did not want Mr Salahi to know where she was,' said police in Warren County, Virginia, in a statement. 'She seemed calm, was engaged in conversation and assured the deputy that she had left the residence with a good friend and was where she wanted to be. She advised she did not want to be home right now.' Naturally humiliated, Tareq plans to divorce his cheating souse, according to a report on TMZ. Reality on the red carpet: Michaele Salahi, second left, posed with her Real Housewives of D.C. co-stars last year before her most recent scandal broke .

"By . Chris Brooke . Last updated at 10:20 AM on 15th September 2011 . A philandering music teacher sobbed as he told police how he killed his fiancée after she ‘lashed out’ at him in an argument over the care of their daughter, a jury heard yesterday. Andrew Lindo, 29, described graphically how he first tried to strangle Marie Stewart at their home before battering her with a Winnie the Pooh chair and eventually stabbing her. Lindo claimed Miss Stewart, 30, the mother of his two children, had generally become ‘abusive, insulting, rude and demeaning’ towards him. Killed: The body of Marie Stewart was found after seven weeks; Andrew Lindo told police how he had killed her after they had an argument . He told police he had been driven to infidelity by his partner’s jealousy and concern about who he was texting. Describing the row in the bedroom that led up to the alleged murder, Lindo said Miss Stewart got ‘really angry and lashed out at me, hitting me. I was getting more and more upset. She just kept hitting me and I grabbed her arm.’ Lindo said he then grabbed his fiancée around the throat. ‘I just kept squeezing and squeezing and squeezing,’ he told police. ‘When I let go I was thinking “this is just a nightmare, this is just horrible’’.’Lindo dragged Miss Stewart downstairs but she started making ‘gurgling’ noises and he tied a belt around her neck to try to make it stop. Grief: Katie Stewart and Robert Stewart, the father and sister of murder victim Marie heard all the sordid details . In the dark: Marie Stewart's mother Helen at Bradford Crown Court, and right, Angela Rylance, the woman whom Andrew Lindo was having an affair with . But the noises continued and he thought ‘I’m obviously s*** at strangling you, I’m going to hit you’ and he picked up his daughter’s wooden Winnie the Pooh chair and struck Miss Stewart about the head, Bradford Crown Court heard. He said: ‘I just wanted her to shut up, just wanted her to be quiet, I just wanted the nightmare over.’ Lindo told police he dragged her into the garage and decided to cut her throat. ‘I put some bubble wrap round her face because I didn’t want her to look at me,’ he said. He grabbed a knife and ‘jabbed it in’. Then he put her body in a Virgin Atlantic flight bag and hid it at the back of the garage. ‘I wanted to lock the door and pretend it never happened.’ Scene of the crime: The house at Holmfirth, Huddersfield, where the body of Marie Stewart was found in a suitcase in the garage . He said he’d hoped to convince people she had run away with another man so that he could get on with his life with the children and he tried to ‘ignore’ the fact he had a dead body in the garage. But Miss Stewart’s family became increasing suspicious of her disappearance and seven weeks later police found the body. Lindo was having an affair with cashier Angela Rylance – who believed he was a single parent – at the time and had previously cheated on his fiancée with other unsuspecting women, the court has heard. Lindo told police he and Miss Stewart were sleeping apart after the birth of their second child. ‘We were in the house but we weren’t together,’ he said. ‘She went insular and very demonstrative towards me and insulting me – generally abusive,’ he said. ‘Her behaviour was so rude and so demeaning towards me.’ Lindo told police Miss Stewart was not maternal towards their children and he suspected she had mistreated their three-year-old daughter. He appeared to blame his fiancée for the affair with Miss Rylance  as well.‘I just felt dogged,’ he said. ‘Marie was obsessed about my phone and about who I was texting when I was texting.’  He added: ‘It was almost as if I thought, well you know, b******* to it if you think I’m having an affair then.’ Lindo, of Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, denies murdering Miss Stewart last December but has admitted unlawful killing. The case continues.","First tried strangling her, before battering her with Winnie the Pooh chair and then stabbing her .

A police officer claimed £69,000 on top of his basic annual salary taking home £109,000 in one year, it has been revealed. The unknown police sergeant, employed by the Metropolitan Police, was earning an annual wage of £40,000, but ended up taking home a sum three times that, figures from a Freedom of Information request show. Meanwhile, another police officer from the same force topped up his £30,000 salary by £55,000, The Sun said. The Met pays out the most in police . overtime out of all the police forces in England and Wales, paying out £109million last year. On average London officers get . £4,000 in overtime a year. Just under 100 officers working in jobs including armed and royal protection, regularly claim more than 100 hours a month which boots their annual salary by around £36,000 each. In March, it was revealed that police overtime payments averaged . a million pounds a day over the past decade and were part of the . service’s  ‘culture’. In ten years forces paid out £3.8billion to their officers for working extra hours. The overtime bill for the taxpayer has nearly doubled since 2000, despite huge increases in the number of full-time officers. The Met said policing the riots in the capital in August cost £23million in officer overtime payments. A Met spokesman said overtime is 'called upon when essential to operational effectiveness'. An armed police officer in Westminster, London. Just under 100 officers working in jobs like this regularly claim more than 100 hours overtime a month . Meanwhile, . other figures show a constable working for the Police Service of . Northern Ireland was paid an additional £43,000 in overtime, and another sergeant clocked . up £57,000. In the West Midlands, one police constable was paid £35,000 more and another sergeant took home £37,500 on top of his basic wage. Tory MP Aidan Burley said that overtime in some forces had become institutionalised and said the system needed reform. The Daily Mail last week revealed how more than 3,000 London police officers have a second job which they perform outside their duties, new figures reveal. They are working part-time as masseuses, hairdressers, models, hypnotherapists, antiques dealers and film extras. In total, the Metropolitan Police register of second jobs shows there . are 3,041 officers – nearly one in ten of the entire 31,000 force –  who . have outside business interests.

Two mental health nurses did monkey impressions when they discussed a black colleague during a campaign of racist abuse, a hearing was told today. Susan Horton and Sarah Cullum allegedly called the woman a 'gorilla' and made comments like 'they shouldn't be allowed to breed' in front of other staff members. They are also accused of seriously mistreating dementia patients at St Mary's Hospital, Kettering, Northamptonshire. Sarah Cullum, left, and Susan Horton, right, allegedly called a black colleague a 'gorilla' and said 'they shouldn't be allowed to breed' in front of . other staff . Horton referred to black colleagues as 'n****rs' and 'it' while her patients were branded 'parasites' and 'beasts', the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. She faces 44 separate misconduct charges including claims she refused to accept a student she thought might be black. The nurse is also accused of hitting and kicking a male patient, identified only as Patient B, then dragging him from his bedroom to a corridor by his feet. On other occasions, she allegedly shouted at him that he smelled of urine and made comments about his sexuality, including asking whether he was gay. Susan Horton and Sarah Cullum are also accused of seriously mistreating dementia patients at St Mary's Hospital, Kettering, Northamptonshire . One of the charges she faces accuses her of 'suggesting that he was moving rooms because he was homosexual and preferred the company of men'. Horton worked on the Ian Bennett ward and the charges relate to a series of incidents 'in or around June 2007'. She is accused of repeatedly insulting her colleague Mary Branswahi, who it is claimed she called 'Scary Mary'. It is alleged that 'in the presence of other members of staff' she 'would impersonate monkeys' when speaking about Ms Branswahi. On one occasion it is claimed she said: 'Save the bananas for Mary.' It is also said she referred to 'gollys', the jungle and claimed: 'They can't speak English.' Cullum, who worked on the same ward, faces 30 separate charges, many of which overlap with those faced by Horton. She is also accused of referring to the hospital's Carlton dementia ward as 'The United Nations' and claiming 'there is not a single white face next door, they're all black.' When discussing a list of possible students she is accused of saying: 'We don't do black.' The nurse also allegedly left a patient who was unable to get up lying on the floor for two hours. Horton denied all but one of the charges, admitting only that she had once said words to the effect of 'excuse me skinny' to a staff member. Cullum denied all but three, accepting she had refused to help a patient with her medication, spoken rudely to another patient and referred to Carlton Ward as the United Nations. If the nurses are found guilty of their charges and their fitness to practise is judged to be impaired, they could face being struck off. The hearing continues and is expected to last five days.","Pair also accused of mistreating dementia patients .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Last updated at 3:47 PM on 19th September 2011 . These are the four miners who were killed in the pit tragedy that devastated a community last week. Pictured together for the first time, David Powell, 50, Charles Breslin, 62, Phillip Hill, 45, and Garry Jenkins, 39, died after a flash flood in the narrow mineshaft. The investigation into the accident at Gleision colliery in the Swansea Valley  which left four dead is expected to focus on concerns over safety levels inside the colliery. As police police prepare to probe the mine owner Gerry Ward, 47, it has been reported that he was previously prosecuted for fly-tipping and, in 2002, for passing off low-quality coal as high-quality. The revelation came as an investigation was launched into a shocking Facebook page that mocked the fate of the four men and families paid tribute to the 'proud miners'. Charles Breslin, 62, (left) was killed alongside Phillip Hill, 45, (right) and two other miners in the accident at Gleision Colliery last week . David Powell, 50, (left) lost his life in the tragedy. Garry Jenkins was killed in the accident . Police received numerous complaints from members of the public who called for action to get the page taken down and a union official condemned the site as 'thoroughly sick'. The Facebook site, which took the form of an online hate campaign targeting the Welsh with racial slurs and trivialising the tragic deaths, appeared to be the work of one person. One comment read: 'In a boost to the failing jobs market in South Wales, 4 new vacancies have been created in the Swansea area from Monday!' 'I hope they catch the people responsible for this as quickly as possible. It is thoroughly sick,' said Ian Morgan, an National Union of Miners official based in the Rhondda Valley. 'Facebook is not the sort of thing I get involved in but whoever is behind this deserves to be arrested and punished in court with the full force of the law. 'I hope they are caught quickly and I urge the police to act with rapidity.' A spokesman for the South Wales Police . confirmed that a significant number of complaints about the site had . been received and it was now under investigation. According to the BBC, Facebook has taken down what it called an offensive page and removed the profiles of its creators. A Facebook spokesman told the broadcaster: 'Online and off, a tiny minority of people are intent on causing offence to others. 'At Facebook, we have built rigorous . reporting tools that enable people to report content that makes them . feel uncomfortable. If content breaches our terms, it will be removed.' Tributes: Flowers lines the street as local people leave notes for the four dead miners left at Cilybebyll near Pontardawe, south Wales . Heartbroken: Floral tributes and notes for the four dead miners were . left at Cilybebyll near Pontardawe, south Wales after the tragedy last . Thursday . Grieving: Families of the miners are calling for the pit to be shut down and sealed up for ever once the investigation is complete . Relatives of the miners have today paid tribute to the 'happy and hard-working"" family men. The families told of the most 'harrowing' time of their lives as they waited with 'increasingly dwindling hope' as rescuers battled to reach them. They said the men were 'proud miners' thanked the rescue teams who risked their own lives in a vain bid to pull them out of the pit. The most poignant tribute came from Garry's seven-year-old son Alex who said: 'Dad was a great darter and a motorbike rider but most of all he was a great dad. 'I am going to miss him, he will always be loved.' Garry's family said he was always happy, hard working and never without a smile on his face.  His relatives said: 'He would help anybody he could in any way. 'He lived life to the full enjoying his caravanning and following his family and supporting them in their motocross racing. 'His other passion was playing darts with his good mates at his local.' Relatives of Philip Hill revealed it is the third tragedy to hit the family - his son Simon and mother Merle both died within the last 10 months. A family spokesman said: 'We wish to thank the Mines Rescue teams who worked tirelessly to bring our Philip home safely but sadly in vain. 'Their efforts have not gone unnoticed and without their continual hard work throughout the rescue attempt we would not have our Philip home to allow us to grieve.' Messages of sorrow: Notes were left on a board at St David's Church in Resolven, South Wales - the home of one of the miners who died . Church services across South Wales paid tribute to Phillip Hill, Garry Jenkins, David Powell, and Charles Breslin. The Archbishop of Wales Dr Barry Morgan said the tragedy had moved an entire nation and the world . The family also thanked the Red Cross, WRVS volunteers and local shops who donated food and supplies during the 36-hour rescue attempt. Miner Charles Breslin was due to retire but loved the work and comradeship so much he carried on working. The father and grandfather amazed men half his age by managing to shovel 20 tons of coal a day at the small hillside pit. His wife Mavis, 60, said in a statement: 'The terrible accident which robbed Charles of his life has left the whole family without a husband, father and brother. 'The many hours of waiting, with increasingly dwindling hope alongside the families of the other trapped miners were the most harrowing of our lives. 'The dedication and commitment from the emergency services were very much appreciated by all concerned. 'No one could have done more as they bravely raced against the clock and put their own lives in danger. Their bravery should be rewarded.' Keen fisherman Charles was Vice Chairman of the Ystalyfera Royal British Legion and had been a member of Territorial Army. He and Mavis had just completed building their own dream home in the village of Cwmllynfell, four miles from the pit where he died. Mavis added: 'He never had a bad word to say about anyone. He had been a coal miner for most of his working life, a job which his father had done before him, and had worked at most of the small mines in the area during his life. A service is held at St. John the Evangelist church in Cilybebyll, where thoughts and prayers were given for the injured and dead miners. Right, resident look at floral tributes on a small road junction close to Gleision Colliery . Two miners covered in coal dust sit and reflect on the tragedy that has rocked the small mining community . 'The whole family appreciate the many messages of condolences from people who knew Charles, as well as from many sympathisers who had not known him but had we felt shared in our long vigil during rescue efforts.' The family of pit maintenance manager David Powell said: 'He was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather, son and true friend. 'Dai was a proud colliery, our life and soul. He brought joy and fun to everyone he met.' Father-of-four Mr Powell was very proud that his son Daniel, 26, followed him down the pit. Daniel was one of the three survivors of last week's tragic flash flood at the small private mine. Meanwhile, investigators entered the . mineshaft for yesterday as they seek to establish the causes of the . accident. Police are also preparing to interview the pit owner. A . spokesman said the team ‘will draw on technical expertise’, with . specialist mine inspectors working closely with South Wales Police.Key . to their investigations will be statements from survivors. Mr . Powell’s son Daniel, 26, was carrying equipment with Mark Lloyd, 45, a . short distance away from the point where torrents of water filled the . narrow tunnels. Both men escaped unharmed. Mine manager Malcolm Fyfield, 56, who . crawled out of a narrow ventilation shaft, was still fighting for his . life in hospital yesterday. There have been calls for the pit to be shut and sealed once the investigation is complete. It is thought the men were drilling without knowing that thousands of gallons of trapped rainwater were on the other side of the coal seam. Prayers were said in church services across Wales at the weekend, while a fund to offer financial support to the grieving families, supported by Prince Charles, has raised more than £50,000. Among tributes left at St John the Evangelist church in Cilybebyll – the closest village to the scene of the  disaster – was one from Mr Hill’s eldest daughter Kyla, 11. She placed  a bouquet of flowers with a card on which she had written: ‘Hi dad, I love and miss you forever.’ Her mother Donna, Mr Hill’s widow,  left a note which said: ‘Thank you for being part of our lives.

Most people dread the blustery rainy weather and dark mornings of autumn, but for one six-year-old girl the dull days are a blessed relief. Every time the sun shines little Sarah Chapman is left in excruciating pain from an incurable skin complaint. The little girl suffers from rare skin condition porphyria which means she has to be totally covered from harmful rays from the sun every time she leaves home. Rare condition: Little Sarah, from Sunderland, must cover up when out in the sunshine. Her skin will itch and swell up if she is exposed to the sun's rays . Exposure to the sun for even a few seconds will see the youngster's skin swell and become unbearably painful and itchy. Sarah, from West Bolton, Sunderland, is one of only handful of children in the UK who suffer from the rare genetic condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria. Her brother and sister are both clear of the condition. The schoolgirl has even dubbed rainy and . overcast days 'Sarah's weather' as these are the only days she can . venture outside without sunblock and a range of measures to keep her . safe. Still smiling: Sarah Chapman and parents Gillian and Bryan at home in Sunderland, the schoolgirl has a rare skin condition which means she must avoid the sun's rays . Every day Sarah is forced to wear sunscreen, hats and gloves to shield her skin from the sun and must use an umbrella when she leaves the house. Her mother Gillian first realised something was wrong when Sarah was just three years old and her hands started to swell up. EPP is an extremely painful condition which is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme ferrochelatase. High levels of this  in the skin results in the unbearable itching that sufferers must endure. The condition usually presents when a child and mostly affects the upper surfaces of arms, legs and the feet. If the EPP is serious a sufferer can loose skin in sheets after severe blistering due to sun exposure. Normal anti-itch creams and treatments cannot soothe the unbearable itching and the main treatment is preventative by covering the skin. Because the condition can cause nerve damage sufferers often present with symptoms of muscle weakness. She said: 'Sarah's hands became swollen into the shape of a claw and we took her to South Tyneside District Hospital where she underwent tests. 'She was transferred to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, where the doctors at first thought she had an allergy to something.' The family kept a diary of Sarah's ailments as doctors battled to discover why the youngster's face and hands were swelling up and causing her pain. Eventually medics diagnosed EPP and Sarah and her family have been able to safeguard her from the sun. The family car has even had its windows darkened so that the little girl can travel safely. Mrs Chapman added: 'It's really sad when the rest of the family is out sunbathing and enjoying the sun, and Sarah cannot join in. 'But she knows how she can suffer in sunlight and will say, 'I don't want that, mammy! 'So holidays in hot countries abroad are a no-no and apart from her hat, gloves, umbrella and sun block, we even have the windows of the car protected, in case the rays of the sun affect Sarah's skin.' It is thought that EPP is a condition caused by a genetic disorder and that both Mrs Chapman and her husband Brian have the faulty gene and have passed it on to Sarah. Mrs Chapman adding: 'It's thought that Bryan and I both have the faulty gene, which has caused Sarah's condition, which has not affected our other children, Matthew, four, and nine-year-old Rebecca. 'A lot of research is taking place in the US into porphyria and EPP and we would like to increase awareness of the condition in this country and help to raise money for research.'",Sarah must remain fully covered outdoors to avoid her skin swelling and blistering .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:29 PM on 2nd September 2011 . A military-style school staffed entirely by ex-servicemen is set to open for  deprived children in response to the riots, it has been revealed. Leading military personnel, including the captain of an elite Afghan  counter-insurgency unit and former Chief of Defence Staff, are establishing a revolutionary 'free school', called the Phoenix. Housed in Territorial Army barracks in Oldham, it will have a zero tolerance approach to bad behaviour and will foster academic and sporting competitiveness. Plans: A military-style school staffed entirely by ex-servicemen is set to open for deprived children in response to the riots, it has been revealed . Its founders have said they will 'rip-up' the national curriculum and pupils starting the school, aged 11, will be taught nothing but literacy and numeracy until they have reached minimum standards in both disciplines. High moral standards will be instilled and its teachers will seek to ensure  pupils do not leave the school with 'an inflated sense of self-worth'. And 'all liberal shibboleth' (jargon) taught at teacher training will be jettisoned. The announcement came as England's first 'free' schools  - the Aldborough E-Act Free School, in East London, and Krishna-Avanti primary, in Leicester, opened their doors to pupils. Free Schools, a flagship Coalition policy and a cornerstone of David Cameron's Big Society ethos, are semi-independent state schools set up by parents, teachers, faith groups and other organisations. Flagship: Free schools are a cornerstone of Prime Minister David Cameron's Big Society project . Aldborough, a primary with 25 per cent of its 120 places still available, is to have a shortened four-week summer holiday and extended opening hours – from 8am  to 6pm - to cater for working parents. It will follow the national curriculum  and focus on academic rigour. The Krishna-Avanti primary school will give pupils a Hindu faith-based education, with daily prayers, a vegetarian diet, and the chance for pupils to  take part in yoga, meditation and the arts. However, its head teacher is a devout Christian and half of the pupils it will admit can come from any faith. The schools are the first of 24 to open this September and will be followed by dozens more next year. The Phoenix school is still at pre-proposal stage and would not open until September 2012, at the earliest. If approved, it is likely to be based in a gothic building, old Drill Hall - MoD premises in Oldham which house a disused TA training ground. The training ground was gutted by a fire this April. The school model is the idea of British Captain Burki, of the counter-insurgency unit at Warminster, who was educated at Manchester Hulme Grammar School. Captain Burki is set to retire this year to set-up the school and hopes to roll-out the model across the UK. He is developing the model with Tom Burkard of think-tank the Centre for Policy Studies and Lord Guthrie, former Chief of Defence Staff. As well as scrapping the curriculum Captain Burki will scrap all soft, trendy, 'liberal' teacher training techniques. He said in a report: 'The performance of our armed forces in Afghanistan and elsewhere stands out in stark contrast to the mobs that have recently been roaming our streets. 'As important as role models are, they are only part of the picture. Every liberal shibboleth taught in teacher-training courses will be discarded in favour of proven methods. 'Pupils will not be expected to 'direct their own learning' - most undergraduates are barely capable of this, and it is folly to expect illiterate and innumerate pupils to do the same. 'Rather, teachers should provide the moral and intellectual guidance that all children want and need.' Captain Burki will also place a strong emphasis on sport and outdoor activities to overcome the problem of attention deficit disorder. The school will have a standard admissions policy, recruiting pupils from its catchment area, and students will be encouraged to take rigorous subjects that are needed for entry to elite universities. Harrow educated Lord Guthrie, who was the Chief of Defence Staff between 1997 and 2001, said: 'In my experience, those from the toughest  and roughest backgrounds often respond most enthusiastically to the disciplines expected by our armed services. 'So I suspect that the qualities needed by the modern soldier are innate virtues, one which can be drawn out from all of us. 'But it is clear that too many of our schools are failing to do just that….The  aim is to produce good citizens, not good soldiers.'","Elite military personnel will 'rip up' national curriculum .

A Saudi prince is to be questioned again over allegations he drugged and sexually assaulted a young model on a yacht in the Mediterranean three years ago. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, 56 - one of the world's richest men with an estimated fortune of £12.3billion - is accused of raping the 20-year-old while in Ibiza in August 2008. The case was closed last year on the grounds of insufficient evidence but it has now been re-opened following an appeal. The prince could now be called back to the island to provide a DNA sample. Court papers said forensic tests on the woman found evidence of sexual activity and traces of a sedative. Prince Alwaleed is a leading investor in . both Citigroup and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. media empire, and held . 26th place on this year's Forbes list of the world's richest people. He is the nephew of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and bought London's Savoy Hotel in 2005 for £250million. The alleged victim claims she was lured on to the 384ft yacht Turama after her drink was spiked in a nightclub on the island. She said she woke up during the assault by a man she claims was Prince Alwaleed. This week the prince issued a statement via his investment firm Kingdom Holding Company denying the accusations, branding them 'completely and utterly false.' He said he was not in Ibiza in August 2008 and has not visited the island for more than 10 years. Prince Alwaleed is a leading investor in both Citigroup and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. media empire and bought the Savoy Hotel in 2005 for £250million . The statement also said the prince was unaware of the allegations until earlier this week and said he could have been mistakenly identified as the attacker after someone impersonated him. The statement said: 'The alleged encounter simply never . happened. Indeed, the events could not have happened. 'Neither His Royal Highness nor . his lawyers were informed or aware of any complaint filed in Ibiza in . 2008 or that the same complaint was dismissed in 2010.' The alleged victim's lawyer Javier .

"By . Jade Watkins . Last updated at 5:42 PM on 15th September 2011 . Reality TV star and accused White House gatecrasher Michaele Salahi has run off with Journey's lead guitarist. Salahi's husband, Tareq, had claimed his wife had been kidnapped and criticised authorities for not looking for her. Now it has been revealed Michaele, who starred in Real Housewives of DC is actually living with Journey rocker Neal Schon, the New York Post reports. Found: Michaele Salahi surfaced in Nashville after her husband Tareq reported her missing after she failed to return to their Virginia home on Tuesday . 'Mrs. Salahi said she did not want Mr. Salahi to know where she was,' said police in Warren County, Virginia, in a statement. New love interest: Michaele turned up in Memphis with Journey guitarist Neal Schon . 'She seemed calm, was engaged in . conversation and assured the deputy that she had left the residence with . a good friend and was where she wanted to be. 'She advised she did not want to be home right now.' There were some initial suspicions . that the 'disappearance' was simply a publicity stunt by the Salahis, . who made a splash in November . 2009 when they managed to get into President Obama's first official . state dinner at the White House. But it seems she has simply found love elsewhere. According to website TMZ, Michaele has . previously enjoyed a 'intimate and passionate relationship' with Schon . in the past and went to his show in Nashville on Tuesday. The reality star is now said to be in Memphis with Schon as he continues his U.S tour. Tareq, who is 'devastated' that his wife has left him, raised the alarm after Michaele failed to return to their home in Virginia on Tuesday. 'It is our belief as of last night, . Michaele Salahi may have been kidnapped or abducted and is being held . under duress and forced to tell persons, including authorities, she is . OK,' a representative for Tareq told CCN. She told him that she was heading out to the hairdresser's followed by . a dance class, but reportedly never turned up for her 11am hair . appointment. Infamous: The Salahis rose to notoriety after it . was revealed they had gatecrashed a White House party attended by . President Barack Obama . Later she made a phone call from a peculiar cell number to Tareq, informing him that she was going to visit her mother. But Michaele's mother told Tareq that they never made arrangement to meet up. Tareq reported his wife missing both to the Warren County Sheriff's Department and the FBI. But deputies at the local authorities told Tareq that his wife had previously contacted them to inform them that she was OK. She had told them she was 'dealing with family issues and was safe.' Close friend and fellow Housewives star Jenna Keough also expressed her concern for Michaele today, according to Radaronline. Reality fame: Michaele is seen here, second from left, with her Real Housewives Of D.C co-stars, last year . The . Real Housewives Of Orange County star, who has been trying to get in . touch with her friend, publicly pleaded with Michaele to head straight . to a police station or to call her immediately. 'Check . in with a police department in person to verify that you are safe. There are simply too many crazy people in the world. I know you have . been plagued with stalkers, and I'm extremely concerned for your . safety,' she said in a message via Radaronline. The strange incident comes after . Michaele and Tareq were reportedly set to make a move from the East to . the West Coast in the coming weeks. The couple were said to be in final negotiations last month, to lease a house in Beverly Hills for a cool $20,000 a month. On the move: The reality TV star was last seen in Virginia on Tuesday, but has since emerged in Nashville at a Journey concert with rocker Schon . A . source told entertainment news website TMZ the former Real Housewives . of D.C couple wanted to move closer to Hollywood to further their . 'entertainment careers.' It was also recently revealed that the couple were allegedly planning to have a baby through a surrogate mother. The . pair had reportedly met with professionals at the Northern Virginia . Center for Surrogate Parenting, also last month, in the hopes of getting . the process underway. Michaele . told TMZ she wanted to go with a surrogate because she suffers from . multiple sclerosis ... and was worried that her condition combined with . her age would prove difficult for her to carry a baby. She said: 'I'm overjoyed with the hope of starting a family and the blessing of love and peace a child will bring to our lives.' The couple are set to sell their Oasis Vineyards winery a bankruptcy auction next week. The Salahis rose to notoriety after it was revealed they had gatecrashed a White House party attended by President Barack Obama. The couple mingled with VIPs as Mr . Obama and his wife, Michelle, welcomed guests to the dinner honouring . Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh. Their . antics were only discovered when they posted photographs of themselves . hobnobbing with Washington's elite on their Facebook page causing major . embarrassment to the President's security team.","Tareq Salahi reported his wife missing after she failed to return home on Tuesday .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 3:20 PM on 29th August 2011 . Rare: The talking Gypsy fortune teller in Virginia City is believed to be the last of its kind . Magician David Copperfield reportedly made a $2million (£1.2million) bid for a 100-year-old 'talking Gypsy fortune teller' that he believes is the only one of its kind in the world - but she could fetch even more than that. Collectors are battling for ownership over the machine, which sat for decades amid Old West kitsch at a restaurant called Bob’s Place in Virginia City, Montana, and now resides in a museum there. Word got out about the Gypsy when the Montana Heritage Commission began restoring her five years ago. Some mistook her for Zoltar, the . fortune-telling machine featured in the Tom Hanks movie Big. But instead . of dispensing a card like Zoltar, the Gypsy actually speaks your . fortune from a hidden record player. When . you drop a nickel in the slot, her eyes flash, her teeth chatter and . her voice comes floating from a tube extending out of the . eight-foot-tall box. David Copperfield told The Associated Press that he thinks she is ‘only one of one’. Copperfield . wanted the Gypsy to be the crown jewel in his collection of turn-of the . century penny arcade games. It would occupy a place of pride among the . magician's mechanised Yacht Race, Temple of Mystery and various machines . that tested a person's strength. Copperfield acknowledged approaching the curators about buying the Gypsy a few years ago but declined to say what he offered. Janna . Norby, the Montana Heritage Commission curator who received the call . from Copperfield's assistant, said it was in the ballpark of $2million . (£1.2million), along with a proposal to replace it with another . fortune-telling machine. On top of that, he pledged to promote Virginia . City in advertisements. The eyes have it: Janna Norby, curator of collections for the Montana Heritage Commission, stands near the antique machine . Bid: Many visitors find the machine creepy, left, but David Copperfield, right, made a $2million bid for it . But Heritage commission curators, representing the Gypsy's owner - the state of Montana - rejected the idea, saying cashing in on this piece of history would be akin to selling their soul. ‘If we start selling our collection for money, what do we have?’ said Norby, the commission's former curator of collections. The commission's acting director, Marilyn Ross echoed Norby's sentiments: ‘That is not something we would ever consider, selling off these antiques.’ That dismissal has set collectors grumbling. Theo Holstein, a California collector and renovator of such machines, said he thinks the Gypsy is wasted in Virginia City and should be placed in a private collection for proper care. He said he is trying to gather investors to make a $3million bid that would top Copperfield's offer. ‘They don't have any idea what they have. It's like they have the world's best diamond and they just pulled it out of their mineshaft,’ Holstein said. ‘It's good that it's there and it survived, but now it really needs to be part of the world.’ Holstein said he wouldn't be surprised if the machine ultimately sold for $10million (£6.1million) or more. Copperfield also said he is still interested in purchasing it. That could put pressure on the state, which, like the rest of the nation, is facing hard fiscal times. Montana's budget is in the black, but keeping the effects of the recession at arm's length has meant deep budget cuts. Snap happy: Young visitors try an antique picture machine at the Gypsy Museum in Virginia City . Those cuts have hit the Montana Heritage Commission particularly hard. Just weeks after Norby spoke to the AP, her position and three others were eliminated as part of a larger reorganisation to cut $400,000 from the commission's budget, Ross said. The state agency that oversees the commission, meanwhile, is not so quick to reject the idea of selling the Gypsy. Department of Commerce deputy director Andrew Poole said he has not seen any offers in writing, and if one were made, it would go through a bid process that includes the scrutiny of the commission and input from the public. The state inherited the Gypsy in 1998 when it paid $6.5million to buy nearly 250 buildings and their contents in Virginia City and nearby Nevada City from the son of Charles Bovey. Benchmark: A visitor rests his legs outside the Gypsy Museum . The Montana collector spent years buying up the buildings to preserve the two crumbling ghost towns and he stocked them with his ever-growing collection of antique games, music machines and oddities. Bill Peterson, the heritage commission's former curator of interpretation, said the collection includes hundreds of thousands of items, so many that curators are still discovering them. The Gypsy was made sometime around 1906 by the Mills Novelty Co. In restoring her, the curators either replaced or repaired frayed, worn or broken parts with exact replicas. When they couldn't find replicas or period materials, they didn't replace the parts. ‘We don't want to make her anything that she wasn't,’ Norby said. In 2008, they installed the Gypsy as the centrepiece of the Gypsy Arcade amid the ancient wooden buildings of Virginia City's main street. Calliope music spills out into the street, beckoning the tens of thousands of visitors to enter and view the stereoscopes, shock tests, tests of strength, fortune telling machines and love letter machines. The Gypsy presides over the menagerie in the rear, ropes keeping visitors at a distance. All of that care in restoring, preserving and displaying the Gypsy causes state curators to reject Holstein's argument that the machine should be removed from Virginia City and placed in a private collection. ‘A lot of these collectors, they come and say the same thing: “Why is this out in the public? Why don't you just take the money and have a collector restore it the way it should be restored and have it in his private collection?” Well, nobody would ever see it,’ said Peterson, whose position was also eliminated in the cutbacks.","David Copperfield bids $2million for 100-year-old machine in Montana .

"Swiss bank had previously estimated loss at £1.3bn . By . Anna Edwards . Last updated at 4:59 PM on 19th September 2011 . Swiss banking giant UBS has revealed that the scale of the losses allegedly racked up by 'rogue trader' Kweku Adoboli has risen from £1.3billion to £1.5billion. The Swiss bank said the loss was caused by unauthorised trades on stock . index futures made over the past three months. It said the transactions were within normal limits and slipped through . risk controls due to ‘fictitious trades’ in complex financial . instruments called exchange traded funds (ETFs), which were used to . cover up losses. Suspected rogue trader Kweku Adoboli, 31, leaves City of London magistrates court where he was charged with fraud at banking giant UBS . The bank said that 'the true magnitude . of the risk exposure was distorted' because the hedges that traders are . required to put in place had been fabricated. Switzerland’s biggest lender also . suggested that the trades in question involved 'unauthorised . speculative' bets on various S&P 500, Dax and Eurostoxx index . futures, rather than on the Swiss franc, as some had thought. UBS claims that the non-existent . hedges entered into its records were 'fictitious, forward-settling, cash . ETF [exchange-traded fund] positions', trades that had never actually . been executed. UBS also countered suggestions that it . did not notice the trades until Adoboli came forward. They said the . 31-year-old trader – charged on Friday with fraud and false accounting – . had been responding to the bank’s inquiries. It claims that the irregularities came to light last Wednesday during a review of Kweku Adoboli’s trading book, which it has now unwound. Adoboli is then alleged to have 'revealed' the extent of his trading activity. Defiant: UBS boss Oswald Gruebel said he would not be resigning . The bank has now launched an internal investigation into the catastrophic failure of its risk systems. UBS said its board of directors had set up a committee chaired by independent director David Sidwell, former chief financial officer at Morgan Stanley, to conduct an independent investigation into the trades and the bank's control systems. The Swiss bank stunned markets on Thursday when it announced unauthorised trades had lost it about £1.25billion. The bank raised the figure by a further £1.9million on Sunday, and chief executive Oswald Gruebel said the alleged fraud would have consequences for strategy and possibly also for himself. The loss is a heavy blow to the reputation of Switzerland's biggest bank, which had just started to recover after its near collapse during the financial crisis and a damaging U.S. investigation into its aiding wealthy Americans to dodge taxes. By 7.45am today UBS shares were down 1.6 per cent at 10.10 francs, outperforming a 2.6 per cent slide on the European banking stocks index. UBS boss Oswald Gruebel said he would not be resigning, and said calls for his . resignation were ‘purely political’ and that he was ‘not thinking about . stepping down’. He added that while he bore ultimate responsibility, he did not feel . ‘guilty’ for failing to prevent the costly and embarrassing incident. His defiant stance comes amid . suggestions that Swiss regulators could tell the bank to hive off or . close down its investment banking division, which houses the ‘Delta One’ desk where Adoboli worked. Such a drastic response would deal a huge . blow to the City, where UBS employs some 6000 workers. The Financial Services Authority and . Swiss regulators have drafted in accountancy firm Deloitte to . investigate the affair. Meanwhile, UBS senior independent director David Sidwell – a former . finance chief at JP Morgan Chase – is leading the bank’s own probe into . the matter.",Swiss bank had previously estimated loss at £1.3bn .

Yet according to the 37-year-old, she was able to charge an astonishing £20,000 a week for her sexual services. She made the claim to a judge . yesterday as she tried desperately to hang on to hundreds of thousands . of pounds given to her by a client who had stolen the money. Confiscation order: Self-confessed prostitute Dawn Dunbar at her Oxfordshire home yesterday . However, after looking at her in . court, Judge Stephen John took a different view on her worth – and ruled . that while £2,000 might be a fair price for seven days of sex, £20,000 . was completely over the top. The figure is important because it . has been argued that if the cash she was given was for payment for . services, she could not be compelled to give it back. If, however, it . was a gift, she could. Self-confessed prostitute Miss Dunbar . received £1.75million from Paul Hopes, an accounts manager for the Toys . R Us shop chain. In just 18 months he stole £3.7million from the toy . firm, and was only caught when neighbours of Miss Dunbar alerted police . to her lavish lifestyle, fearing she was a drug dealer. Judge John said: ‘The amount is not . £500 a week. It is not £1,000, or even £2,000 a week. It is £20,000 a . week. How do you manage to evaluate your services – sex – at £20,000 a . week? How do you justify that?’ Miss Dunbar, who also received a . £132,000 Bentley from Hopes, said: ‘It wasn’t me that was putting the . worth on that. It was Mr Hopes paying what he thought it was worth.’ Married father-of-two Hopes, 60, was . on a salary of £56,000 a year when he suddenly developed an unquenchable . thirst for vice and began his massive fraud. Paul Hopes, left, admitted 14 counts of theft and four of money laundering - but spent none of his ill-gotten gains on wife Gillian, right . He spent little on his oblivious wife . Gillian, or their home in Woodley, Berkshire, but used the cash to pay . for sex and gifts for Miss Dunbar and four other prostitutes. On . occasions he enjoyed £800-a-time cocaine binges while visiting luxury . hotels and restaurants with them. Hopes was duly divorced by his wife, . who retained the £400,000 family home. He was jailed for seven years in . 2009, and warned he could stay in prison for an extra decade if he . failed to repay the stolen money. At Reading Crown Court, Judge John . ruled that the sums given to Dunbar were gifts rather than payment for . services and she would have to hand the loot back. That is, the money . she has left after  spending £750,000 of it on a £300,000 house and . cars. Miss Dunbar, a married mother of two, . of Didcot, Oxfordshire, was earning barely £10,000 a year at a . bookmakers when she turned to earning extra money by working at the . Gemini massage parlour in Reading in 2005. On her very first day she met Hopes. He swiftly arranged to pay her a weekly fee of £500 for her services, . before persuading her to leave the business and see him exclusively, for . a weekly fee of £1,000. That continued with him also giving her . additional payments and making extravagant gestures. Double life: Hopes' former home in Woodley, Berkshire, which has now been given to his wife in a divorce settlement . And when she told him ‘Every girl wants a Bentley’, he promptly bought her one – a Continental Flying Spur. Miss Dunbar told the court: ‘Everything I received was a payment for my escort services and for him to see me exclusively.’  She was not his lover, she went on, and was simply providing sexual services in return for payment. Miss Dunbar said: ‘He said I was his mistress, which I was, but in a specific meaning – he would call me his mistress if he wanted me to whip him and treat him quite badly.’ Judge John ruled the receivers appointed to chase the missing cash could seize a £25,000 Lexus GS300 Miss Dunbar bought for her father, a £30,000 Toyota Landcruiser she bought for her husband Martin Iheanacho, and her own runabout, a £42,000 Lexus RS400h 4x4 car. The enforcement team will also go after properties she bought, both in the UK and a £60,000 plot of land in her husband’s native Nigeria.Approached at her house, Miss Dunbar said: ‘I’m in shock,’ before slamming the door.

More fatalities are feared after two more deaths were linked to the batch of infected fruits. So far there are confirmed deaths in Colorado, one in Oklahoma and two in New Mexico. Deadly: While millions enjoy the melons, a batch from Jensen Farms in Holly, Colorado is suspected to be infected with listeria which has killed four people . The illnesses have been traced to fruit from Jensen Farms in Holly, Colorado, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had found listeria in samples of Jensen Farms' cantaloupe taken from a Denver store. Samples taken from equipment and cantaloupe at the farm's packing facility also confirmed a match to the strain of the disease. Listeria is often found in soil, plants, and food and it is fairly rare for people to die from infections. Pasteurisation and cooking is normally enough to kill Listeria and it’s often the elderly who die because they are not strong enough to fight infection. It is also dangerous to pregnant women because it easily passes through to the foetus. Symptoms of listeria include fever and muscle aches, often with other gastrointestinal symptoms. Officials say 35 people in 10 states have been suffered in the outbreak so far in California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia. Bacteria: Listeria can spread from soil and rivers and generally kills elderly people who don't have strong immune systems . Colorado has been the most affected with 12 cases, followed by Oklahoma with six and New Mexico with five. Anyone who has bought one of the suspected contaminated cantaloupes is being advised to throw it out immediately. About 800 cases of listeria are found in the United States each year, according to CDC, and there usually are three or four outbreaks. Most of these are traced to deli meat and soft cheeses, where listeria is most common. Produce has rarely been the culprit, but federal investigators say they have seen more produce-related listeria illnesses in the last two years. It was found in sprouts in 2009 and celery in 2010.","Infection linked to batch of fruit from farm in Holly, Colorado ."

After two years behind bars, two U.S. hikers jailed as spies in Iran were reunited with family members after securing their freedom today after a court approved a $1million bail deal. Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal were released from Tehran's notorious Evin prison and flew out of the Tehran International airport on a private jet after posting $500,000 bail each. Their Iranian lawyer, Masoud Shafiei, revealed the $1million sum was paid by Oman, an ally of the U.S. that also has diplomatic ties with Iran. Scroll down for video . Emotional reunion: Shane Bauer hugs fiance Sarah Shourd, right, after arriving in Muscat, Iran, following his release from Tehran's notorious Evin prison . Brotherly love: Freed Josh Fattal embraces his brother shortly after his arrival in Muscat, Oman . A short time later, they emerged from the plane in Oman, where they were reunited with loved ones, some they had not seen for two years. 'We're so happy we are free,' Mr Fattal said at a press conference in Oman. Mr Bauer added: 'Two years in prison is too long' In a statement released later Wednesday, the families of Mr Bauer and Mr Fattal said: 'Today can only be described as the best day of our lives. We have waited for nearly 26 months for this moment and the joy and relief we feel at Shane and Josh’s long-awaited freedom knows no bounds. Celebration: Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer embrace hug their loved ones in Muscat, Oman, hours after their release from Tehran's Evin prison . 'We now all want nothing more than to wrap Shane and Josh in our arms, catch up on two lost years and make a new beginning, for them and for all of us.' President Obama told ABC News that he was 'thrilled' to hear the news. 'And I could not feel better for the families and those moms we’ve been in close contact with. A wonderful day for them and for us.' Reporters gathered outside of Iran's infamous Evin prison said they saw the men being escorted from the facility with Swiss and Omani officials on their way to the airport, where a private jet is reportedly waiting to take them out of the country.

Free men: American hikers Shane Bauer, right, and Josh Fattal, center, sit with Swiss Ambassador Livia Leu Agosti in Tehran's Mehrabad airport today before leaving Iran for Oman . They were arrested along the Iran-Iraq border in July 2009 and sentenced last month to eight years each in prison. Freed: Sarah Shourd, who had been walking with the two men, has already been released on bail . A third American in the group, Sarah Shourd, was freed last year on bail. The men's Iranian attorney Masoud Shafiei said: 'Now we can say they are finally free. They can go to the U.S. the way Sarah did.' Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International's deputy director for Middle East and North Africa, said: 'Iranian authorities have finally seen sense' and have agreed to release Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal. They must now be allowed to leave Iran promptly to be reunited with their families.' Although the hikers' fate has gripped America, it rattled already strained ties with the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program and its ambitions to widen military and political influence in the Middle East and beyond. But — for a moment at least — U.S. officials may be adding words of thanks in addition to their calls for alarm over Iran. News of their release comes as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is slated to speak at the U.N. General Assembly and meet with several world leaders this week. President Obama will speak at the General Assembly today. The case of Mr Bauer and Mr Fattal, both 29, who were convicted of spying for the U.S., has deepened the mistrust between Washington, D.C., and Tehran. Mr Shafiei told the AFP that the $1million bail was paid by Oman, an ally of the U.S. that also has diplomatic ties with Iran. Mr Shafiei said the bail of $500,000 for each of the men was posted after last-minute problems in the bank were resolved. Oman is also believed to have been involved in paying Miss Shourd's bail last year. Last week, Oman dispatched a plane - belonging to the Gulf country's ruler to fetch the two Americans if the freedom-for-bail was reached - that was waiting at the Tehran airport. Omani officials declined to comment on the ongoing proceedings for the Americans' release. The three Americans - friends from . their days at the University of California at Berkeley - have maintained . their innocence and denied the espionage charges against them. Their . families say they were just hiking in northern Iraq's scenic and . relatively peaceful Kurdish region when they may have accidentally . strayed over the unmarked border with Iran. Since her release last year, Shourd has lived in Oakland, California. Mr . Bauer, a freelance journalist, grew up in Onamia, Minnesota, and . Fattal, an environmental activist, is from suburban Philadelphia. Mr Bauer proposed to Miss Shourd while the trio was detained, promising that they would be married when they were released.

"By . Martin Robinson . Last updated at 2:39 PM on 9th September 2011 . A British pensioner who became friends with some of the world's most dangerous death row rapists and murderers has decided to display a collection of their artwork in the UK. Winchester resident Maggie Allder, 60, has spent nine years exchanging letters and visiting the convicts in Texas and Arizona during summer holidays, even attending one of their executions. The retired school teacher says she counts the murderers, rapists and robbers amongst her friends and has built up a collection of their artwork created behind bars. She is so proud of their art that she will exhibit them near her home this weekend. Death row: Maggie Allder pictured with Karl Chamberlain, who was convicted of rape and murder and she was there to see him executed in 2008 . Going on display is paintings and sketches by four murderers, as well as pictures of her and her friends including Karl Chamberlain, who was killed by lethal injection in 2008 for murdering and raping a woman. Mrs Allder attended his execution and had visited him several times in the United States. 'I began writing to prisoners on death row nine years ago after spotting an advert in a Quaker magazine asking for pen pals for inmates,' she said. Death row art: Frank McCray (top left) raped and killed a woman in 1987 but in jail has created art of American Indians by melting down crayons (right and below) 'I struck up a friendship with Karl Chamberlain, who had been convicted of the rape and murder of a young woman and had been on death row in Texas since 1997. 'Karl turned out to be a self-educated but intelligent man. He used his time to read and had many pen friends and was a very interesting man.' After exchanging several letters, Maggie began visiting Karl during the summer holidays from her teaching job. She said: 'My first visit was the most frightening thing I have ever done. Scott Nordstrom (left) was put on death row for his involvement in the killing of six people and his art will be displayed in the UK this weekend . 'Now I do it every year and it is fine but at the time I didn't sleep because I was so nervous.' Maggie continued to visit Karl up until his execution, aged 37, in 2008, which she attended. 'It was very traumatic. I was OK for a couple of weeks afterwards and then I had a bit of post-traumatic stress and I couldn't sleep,' she said. 'But everyone at home was very supportive. 'I am not in favour of the death penalty as you cannot always be certain you have the right man or woman.' Murray Hooper (left) was part of a gang that robbed and killed two people and has since developed a talent for sketching . The paintings and sketches are all the more remarkable as they must . be made using crudely fashioned objects as prisoners are not allowed . certain materials in case they use them as weapons. The killers and sex offenders are only allowed to use the ink taken from . the plastic casing of biros and paint is made by melting coloured . pencils. Frank McCray who paints American Indians, murdered Chestene Cummins in 1987 after breaking into her home as she was packing for a holiday to California. When the victim's boyfriend arrived home from work he found lying in the bedroom raped, beaten and strangled to death. He evaded capture for 13 years until he was caught using DNA evidence. John Sansing, who sketched an angel looking to the heavens, rang a church and requested a charitable food delivery, intending to rob the delivery person so he could purchase cocaine for himself and his wife. Trudy Calabrese delivered the food and Sansing, while his wife and four children were in the home, bound her arms and legs before raping and killing her by beating her over the head and stabbing her. John Sansing (left) killed a woman with his wife and four children in the house, and is one of the people befriended by Maggie Allder since being put on death row . In 1980 Murray Hooper, whose art shows a woman with her two children, went into a Phoenix home of Patrick Redmond to rob him, his wife, and his mother-in-law, Helen Phelps, at gunpoint. After taking jewellery and money, the intruders bound and gagged the victims they shot each victim in the head and also slashed Mr Redmond's throat, but he survived and later identified all three killers. Scott Nordstrom, who drew a railway track, was convicted in 1996 for killing 6 people in two separate armed robberies, which included executing one man who refused to open a safe. Ms Allder  is responsible for correspondence for humanitarian group Human Writes. 'Every human being deserves friendship, concern and care, whether they are prisoners or victims,' she said. 'I discovered that quite a lot of the Arizona prisoners were talented at art. They are locked up all day and don't have much to do. 'They are not allowed things like biros, in case they use them as knives, so they are just given the ink and have to improvise. 'One prisoner, Frank McCray, gets round the fact he doesn't have paint by melting coloured pencils. 'Their work often has themes of freedom or religion. It shows that even people who may have committed acts can achieve extraordinary things if given the chance.' The exhibition is being held at the Quaker Meeting House in Colebrook Street, Winchester, from 1pm to 5pm on Saturday and Sunday.","Maggie Allder visits the prisoners during her holidays and counts them as her friends .

California's cities are so polluted they pose a serious health risk to their millions of residents for 135 'smog days' a year, experts have revealed. America's worst, the Riverside-San Bernadino area and Los Angeles, also had 27 'red alert' days in 2010 where air quality was so bad healthy people could . develop breathing difficulties or even have a heart attack. A new environmental study has ranked every American metropolitan area by smog and Baltimore, Washington DC and Philadelphia make up the rest of the top five, followed by Houston, Atlanta, Sacramento, St Louis, and Louisville. Toxic: The skylines of Los Angeles, pictured above, and Houston, pictured below, both shrouded in a thick cloud of smog. The millions of residents in both cities had dozens of days where they were breathing dangerous levels of ozone last year . In total the five worst cities, with more than 25 million residents . between them, had 274 smog days combined last year. As set out in the Clean Air Act, a smog day is when ozone was within the range of 60 to 70 parts per billion of air for more than eight hours. It becomes a red alert day when it exceeds that range. Controversially the Obama administration was going to consider lowering these levels this month to improve standards, but has now shelved it for two years. Environment America , who have published the data, also say 48 per cent of all Americans live in areas with unhealthy levels of smog pollution. Table1 . 'Americans deserve clean air. But on far too many days, people all across the country are exposed to dangerous smog pollution,' a spokesman said. 'Pollution from power plants and vehicles puts the health of our nation’s children and families at risk. 'Studies show that on days with high concentrations of smog pollution in the air, children and adults suffer more asthma attacks, increased respiratory difficulty, and reduced lung function. Exposure to smog pollution can exacerbate respiratory illness and even cause premature death.' Childhood asthma: More than 165,000 children in Los Angeles alone have the condition . The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set the national standard for smog based on the latest science on air quality and public health. But the EPA's own independent scientists say the current standard, set in 2008, does not adequately protect public health. As a result, Environment America's report says people nationwide have been 'exposed to days of poor air quality each summer without even knowing it.' A state by state comparison has also been carried out with California dominating with 135 days smog days in 2010, more than a . third of the year. Californian Republican Lucille Roybal-Allard said the report 'confirms what we already know,' but that this was unacceptable. 'In Los Angeles, we know that smog is a major threat to the health of our families. Over 700,000 people in our city suffer from asthma, including 165,000 children,' she said. Texas, Utah, Maryland, Pennsylvania, . New Jersey, Ohio and New York each had at least 30 of these days in 2010. Seventeen states experienced at least one “red alert” day for unhealthy air, . indicating pollution levels high enough in a particular area so that anyone . could start experiencing adverse health effects. And only nine states did not record any . days in 2010 on which levels of smog pollution exceeded the standard, which were Alaska, . Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and . Wyoming.",The Riverside-San Bernadino area and Los Angeles have the worst air quality in the country .
"By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 4:13 PM on 21st September 2011 . It weighs six tons, it’s spinning out of control and it’s going to plunge back to Earth some time this month. Nasa estimates that there’s a 1 in 3,200 chance that pieces of the defunct satellite could hit someone when it plunges from orbit. It would be the first time in history someone was injured by space debris. The Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, or UARS, ran out of fuel in 2005 and could land on any of six continents. NASA says it could land at any point between 57 degrees north and 57 degrees south - which includes almost all the populated areas of our planet (see map below). Most of the satellite will burn up . during re-entry, but a hefty half-tonne of metal will still plummet to . the Earth’s surface. Danger: The six-ton Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite will crash to Earth and could land in Britain . The satellite could fall anywhere between the two latitudes, where billions of people live . It’s being tracked by the Joint Space Operations Center of U.S. Strategic Command at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, but Nasa admits it has no idea where it will come down, or when. It predicts that it will enter the atmosphere in late September, but it could be October. The space agency said that the crash site will be anywhere between 57 degrees north latitude and 57 degrees south latitude and the remains could scatter over a 500mile area. That means pieces of it could land in Scotland – or somewhere in Chile. Astronomer Dr Ian Griffin, from the UK Association of Science and Discovery Centres, says the Earth's atmosphere slows down falling satellites a great deal. He explained that what remains of UARS will hit the ground relatively slowly and 'certainly not at orbital velocity of 17,500mph'. Much of any satellite crashing to Earth will be disintegrated by heat, caused by friction with the atmosphere. It's the reason we get shooting stars - created by meteors burning up in the upper atmosphere. UARS is large enough, though, that up to half a ton will strike the ground. It will probably not be in one piece, however:  space vehicles experience incredible stress on re-entry. The load can be as much as 10Gs. An F1 car experiences around 5Gs with maximum braking from high speed. The reason why the location of the crash site is so hard to predict is because the density of the atmosphere varies so greatly higher up, producing different amounts of drag. A prediction that was wrong by even a few minutes would mean the satellite landing a huge distance away, owing to its speed. However, a Nasa spokesman pointed out that there has yet to be any reported injury from falling space debris. He said: ‘The risk to public safety or property is extremely small, and safety is NASA's top priority. Since the beginning of the Space Age in the late-1950s, there have been no confirmed reports of an injury resulting from re-entering space objects. ‘Nor is there a record of significant property damage resulting from a satellite re-entry.’ This satellite is far smaller than . the 135-ton Russian space station Mir, which fell to Earth in 2001 or . the 100-ton Skylab that fell in 1979. Mir . fell into the South Pacific, while Skylab hit the Indian Ocean and . parts of sparsely populated western Australia. Because two-thirds of the . Earth is ocean, space debris usually hits water. Nasa is urging anyone who finds a piece of the UARS satellite not to touch it. The . spokesman added: ‘If you find something you think may be a piece of . UARS, do not touch it. Contact a local law enforcement official for . assistance.’ It was launched . back in 1991 by the Space Shuttle Discovery to measure ozone levels, . wind speeds and temperatures in the stratosphere. Junk yard in space: UARS is one of the thousands of objects in Earth orbit being tracked by Nasa, as shown by this computer graphic . But now it’s one of 370,000 pieces of junk floating in space at speeds of up to 22,000mph. The volume of debris was greatly increased by a 2007 Chinese anti-satellite weapon test and a 2009 crash-in-orbit of two satellites. The widely criticised Chinese test used a missile to smash an aging weather satellite into 150,000 pieces of 1cm debris and 3,118 pieces can be tracked by radar on the ground.",It ran out of fuel in 2005 and Nasa has no idea where it will crash land .
"WikiLeaks founder says he has been 'screwed over' to make a buck . Australian who tried to block ghost-written autobiography says he was warned there would be a plot to 'set him up' Publisher accuses Assange of 'distorting events' By . Anna Edwards . Last updated at 5:06 PM on 22nd September 2011 . WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange tried to block the memoir . Despite his attempts to block an explosive autobiography, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's story has been published. The accused rapist was warned that the US government wanted to set him up, according to an unofficial autobiography published today despite his attempts to block its release. In the book, titled Julian Assange: The Unauthorised Autobiography, the controversial whistle-blowing website's creator also admits sleeping with the two women who have made sexual assault claims against him. But he says the rape allegations are either part of the US conspiracy against him or motivated by his failure to return their calls. Publishers Canongate Books decided to put the memoir on sale after Assange, who is on bail in Britain facing extradition to Sweden, attempted to cancel his contract after reading a first draft. Assange, 40, said he wanted to cancel his . contract in June, but by this time he had already signed his advance . over to his lawyers to settle his legal bills for fighting extradition. The website founder has complained he will have to buy a copy of his own newly-published autobiography to find out its contents after he failed to block its release. The WikiLeaks founder tried to cancel his contract for the memoir after reading a first draft, but publishers Canongate Books went ahead with its publication today against his wishes. Assange condemned Edinburgh-based Canongate's publication of the book, billed on the cover as an 'unauthorised autobiography', describing it as a case of 'screwing people over to make a buck'. He said the published memoir was a . 'work in progress' written by his Scottish ghost-writer Andrew O'Hagan, . based on interviews and stressed it was 'entirely uncorrected or . fact-checked by me'. Battle: Assange wanted the book to be scrapped, but publishers printed it . In a strongly-worded statement, he . added: 'I will have to buy 'my autobiography' in order to learn the . extent of the errors and inaccuracies of the content of the book, but . the damage is done.' In one excerpt, published today by . The Independent, the hacker gives his version of the background to the . sexual assault allegations, claiming he met both women - named only as A . and W - in Sweden during the furore that surrounded his website's . leaking of sensitive US documents, before having consensual sex with . them. The book includes insights into Assange's chaotic life as his group became famous around the world for its leaks of highly sensitive records. The Australian - who admits he is 'some kind of weirdo' with a reputation for 'workaholism and infrequent bathing' - travelled the world carrying only 'a bag of socks and underwear, and a bigger bag of laptops and cables', and once had his hair cut as he worked at his computer. His passionate belief in his cause shines through in the book, in which he describes WikiLeaks as the 'first intelligence agency of the people'. Assange accused Canongate of acting 'in breach of contract, in breach of confidence, in breach of my creative rights and in breach of personal assurances' by publishing the memoir. 'This book was meant to be about my life's struggle for justice through access to knowledge. It has turned into something else,' he said. 'The events surrounding its unauthorised publication by Canongate are not about freedom of information, they are about old-fashioned opportunism and duplicity - screwing people over to make a buck.' He claimed he sought to draw up a fresh contract with a new deadline so the book could be revised extensively. Canongate issued a statement in which it accused Assange of offering a 'distorted version of events', adding: 'We believe in the book and maintain we were right to publish it.' Bookshops only learned about the memoir's publication yesterday, and copies were delivered under strict instructions that the boxes could not be opened until this morning. 'I did not rape those women and can not imagine anything that happened between us that would make them think so, except malice after the fact, a joint plan to entrap me, or a terrible misunderstanding that was stoked up between them,' he says. 'I may be a chauvinist pig or some sort but I am no rapist, and only a distorted version of sexual politics could attempt to turn me into one. They both had sex with me willingly and were happy to hang out with me afterwards.' He claims in the book that a contact in a Western intelligence agency told him just before the rape allegations emerged that the US government was considering dealing with him 'illegally'. The source allegedly said Washington officials were discussing everything from planting drugs or child pornography to embroiling him in 'allegations of immoral conduct'. He said he knew he was not safe after the arrest in May last year of US Army intelligence analyst Bradley Manning, 23, who lived in Wales as a teenager, on suspicion of leaking classified information to WikiLeaks. 'I recognised, even then, that forces would always be after me, and they would trap me in some way or another before long,' he writes. Assange does not confirm that Manning provided his organisation's biggest revelations, saying WikiLeaks's 'deniability structures' made it impossible for him to know whether he was the source. But he says the young American soldier would be 'a hero of democracy and justice who had taken a role in saving lives' if he had supplied such information. Assange, 40, who made headlines around the world with revelations from leaked US military files and diplomatic cable, also reveals how a contact in a Western intelligence agency told him that the American government was considering dealing with him 'illegally'. He said the source said means such as planting drugs and child pornography or embroiling him 'in allegations of immoral conduct', were being discussed. Warnings about the potential use of a 'honeytrap' were also made by people close to him, the book says. In another passage, Assange talks about the 'addictive' thrill of hacking into the networks of high profile organisations, including the Pentagon and Nasa, as a young adult. He reportedly gave 50 hours of interviews about his life and the work of WikiLeaks to his Scottish ghost-writer Andrew O'Hagan. But he became 'increasingly troubled' about the thought of publishing an autobiography and after seeing the first draft in March declared: 'All memoir is prostitution', according to the publishers. Edinburgh-based Canongate said it would pay Assange, who is currently living at his bail address of Ellingham Hall in Norfolk, royalties. The book will go on sale priced £20 for the hardback and £14.99 for the ebook.","WikiLeaks founder says he has been 'screwed over' to make a buck .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 7:37 PM on 21st September 2011 . The software testers at Aspiritech are a collection of characters. Katie Levin talks nonstop. Brian Tozzo hates driving. Jamie Specht is bothered by bright lights, vacuum cleaners and the feel of carpeting against her skin. Rider Hallenstein draws cartoons of himself as a DeLorean sports car. Rick Alexander finds it unnerving to sit near other people. This is the unusual workforce of a U.S. startup that specializes in finding software bugs by harnessing the talents of young adults with autism. Oran Weitzberg, left, and Rick Alexander work at Aspiritech, a nonprofit enterprise that specializes in finding software bugs . Traits that make great software testers - intense focus, comfort with repetition, memory for detail - also happen to be characteristics of autism. People with Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, have normal to high intelligence and often are highly skilled with computers. Aspiritech, a nonprofit in Highland Park, Ill., nurtures these skills while forgiving the quirks that can make adults with autism unemployable: social awkwardness, poor eye contact, being easily overwhelmed. The company's name plays on the words 'Asperger's,' 'spirit' and 'technology.' Clients, nine companies in Aspiritech's first two years, have been pleased. 'They exceeded my expectations,' said Dan Tedesco of Shelton, Conn.-based HandHold Adaptive, which took a chance on Aspiritech to test an iPhone application. 'There is a pride in their product you don't usually see in this type of work.' Aspiritech co-founder Moshe Weitzberg works with employees, all of whom have autism disorders . Aspiritech was founded by Moshe and Brenda Weitzberg after their son, Oran, now 32, was fired from a job bagging groceries. Oran was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome when he was 14. He now works at Aspiritech. 'He went from failing at bagging groceries to being one of the best software testers on our team,' said Brenda Weitzberg. The Weitzbergs modeled Aspiritech on a successful Danish company called Specialisterne, or 'the Specialists.' Specialisterne also employs software testers with autism. Its satisfied clients include Oracle and Microsoft. Traits that make great software testers - intense focus, comfort with repetition, memory for detail - also happen to be characteristics of autism Here employees Rick Alexander, Katie Levin, and Jamie Specht work together . Other companies in Belgium, Japan and Israel are either hiring or training adults with autism as software testers. This year, Aspiritech projects $120,000 in revenue, with 60 percent coming from donations and 40 percent from clients. The Weitzbergs hope to raise the client revenue to 50 percent next year. 'There have been a couple of attempts in the U.S. and Aspiritech is the one that's making it,' said Scott Standifer of the University of Missouri's Disability Policy and Studies office and the organizer of a national conference on adults with autism and employment. The exact unemployment rate for adults with autism is unknown, but it's thought to be high, Standifer said. Aspiritech was founded by Moshe and Brenda Weitzberg after their son, Oran, who has Asperger's, was fired from a job bagging groceries . 'We don't know how many adults have autism and, because of that, we don't know their rate of unemployment,' he said. 'We do know from tracking adults just emerging from high school that they are having great difficulty finding jobs.' A 2009 U.S. Department of Education survey found the employment rate for young adults with autism was on par with that for deaf-and-blind young adults, and well below the rate of those with blindness alone or learning disabilities or traumatic brain injuries, Standifer said. Since Asperger's syndrome didn't become a standard diagnosis until the early 1990s, many of Aspiritech's software testers were adults when they first learned they were on the autism spectrum. They are pioneers, the first generation of adults with Asperger's. Katie Levin, 35, was diagnosed in her late 20s with Asperger's. As a child, she'd been labeled as mentally ill. 'Asperger's is not a mental illness,' she said. 'I definitely feel like I identify with the Asperger's community more than I did with the mental illness community.' She tests software and runs Aspiritech's Facebook page and Twitter feed. Employee Katie Levin is reflected in a computer screen. Aspiritech also has organized outings for its employees: miniature golf, bowling, eating at restaurants . Rick Alexander, 24, another tester, has a degree in computer science from the Illinois Institute of Technology and completed an internship developing software for the city of Chicago. 'I have a lot of social anxiety. I don't like meeting new people,' said Alexander, who was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome as a teenager. Like many of the other testers, he lives with his parents. He'd rather be a software developer than a tester, he said. But selling himself in a job interview is 'very difficult for me.' 'When you're a child, the school is very concerned with you, the state is very concerned with you,' Alexander said. Organizations help adults with autism, he said, but 'you need to approach them and for somebody with Asperger's syndrome, it's very difficult to do the approaching.' Most research dollars have gone toward studying children with autism while adults have been neglected, said Molly Losh, an autism researcher at Northwestern University. 'Our vocational structure really isn't suited to funnel people with autism into the workforce,' Losh said. Aspiritech 'is a magnificent and innovative venture,' she said. Aspiritech pays $12 to $15 an hour and bosses never yell if you're late and nobody minds if you need to be alone for a while . Many businesses hire offshore companies to test software. Mike Mestemaker, director of engineering for Schaumburg, Ill.-based ISI Telemanagement Solutions, chose Aspiritech because it offered competitive rates but was based in the United States. 'They dove right in and worked very quickly,' Mestemaker said. 'They were very detail-oriented people. They really got the job done.' ISI was happy with the work and has hired Aspiritech for a second project, he said. Aspiritech provides meaningful work (pay is $12 to $15 an hour) in a relaxed environment where bosses never yell if you're late and nobody minds if you need to be alone for a while. What's more, the company is building social skills. The software testers, who are in their 20s and 30s, are trained to work together and they take part in organized outings: miniature golf, bowling, eating at a restaurant. 'We want to improve social skills among people who tend to be socially isolated,' said Marc Lazar, Aspiritech's autism specialist. For many of them, software testing is not going to be their lifelong career, Lazar said, 'but while they're here they're going to improve their job skills and they're going to learn what kind of behavior is expected on the job and they're going to have more to put on their resumes.'","Aspiritech's name plays on the words 'Asperger's,' 'spirit' and 'technology'"
"Execution would be Alabama's fifth this year . Thirty-five inmates put to death in the U.S. in 2011 . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:25 PM on 23rd September 2011 . A man convicted of the 1994 execution-style shooting death of a store clerk in Alabama is scheduled to be put to death on Thursday by lethal injection in what would be the third U.S. execution this week. The execution of Derrick O'Neal Mason, 37, is set for 6 pm local time at Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore. Mason has been on death row for 16 years. His execution, if carried out, would be the third this week in the U.S., following two high-profile cases in Georgia and Texas. Executed: Derrick Mason was put to death in Alabama last night . In a case that drew international attention, Troy Davis was put to death in Georgia late Wednesday for the murder of a police officer, despite claims by his advocates that he may have been innocent. Texas on Wednesday executed a white supremacist convicted of helping to kill a black man by dragging him behind a truck, in a case that sparked a wave of hate crime laws. Mason's execution would be Alabama's fifth this year. Thirty-five inmates have been put to death in the U.S. in 2011. He was convicted of killing 25-year-old Angela Cagle during the attempted robbery of a convenience store in Huntsville, Alabama. Authorities said he forced Cagle to strip naked and shot her twice in the face at close range. Alabama Governor Robert Bentley on Wednesday said he would not intervene to halt the execution. Earlier this month, the judge who sentenced Mason to death asked Bentley to spare the inmate's life. In a September 8 letter, Judge Loyd Little Jr. did not dispute that Mason 'terrorized the victim.' But he wrote that if he had tried the case as a more experienced jurist, he would have sentenced Mason to life without the possibility of parole. Neither Little nor the defense team had any experience in capital murder cases before the Mason trial, the judge said. Little said that compared to other cases he presided over later, this one was not as 'heinous, atrocious, or cruel.' The judge wrote that without that aggravating factor to consider, the jury 'would have recommended life without parole and I would have followed that recommendation.' In court filings, appellate attorneys for Mason argued that his defense team omitted key mitigating factors during the sentencing phase, including his claim that he smoked a marijuana cigarette the night of the crime that, unknown to him, was laced with psychoactive substances. In a court filing to the state Supreme Court on Wednesday, Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange quoted the judge's sentencing remarks about the heinous nature of the crime. Strange concluded that the judge's 'change of heart is not a basis for this court to grant Mason's petition for a stay of execution.'","Execution would be Alabama's fifth this year .

Tragic: Shaun Van Straaten lost his fight for life today, police confirmed, while his relatives remain in a critical condition in hospital. A schoolboy has died after a fire at his family home, which is believed to have been started by his mother's ex-boyfriend, David Potts. Shaun Van Straaten, 15, was critically injured in the blaze and was taken to hospital for treatment to burns and smoke inhalation, along with other family members, named locally as his mother, Tracy Jones, 40, sister, Cailin, 18, and four-year-old brother, Zach. Shaun lost his fight for life today, police confirmed, while his relatives remain in a critical condition in hospital. Potts, 39, was taken to hospital suffering from severe burns but died a short time after the blaze started, at around 4.50am on Monday. Potts had reportedly gone to the house in Barlow Road in Broadheath, Altrincham, Greater Manchester, and set himself alight. Police have said this is a ‘line of inquiry’ but confirmed the fire is being treated as suspicious and they are not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident. Local reports suggested that Potts had split up with Ms Jones and had attempted to get back with her but was rebuffed. The 39-year-old apparently left a Facebook message for Miss Jones at 1am on Monday, saying: ‘I used to be happy but now I am sad. I used to laugh, now I cry. ‘I used to be someone, now I am no one’, he added just four hours before going to her home, where they allegedly had an argument, the Daily Mirror reported. After the row, he is said to have poured petrol over his body and screamed: ‘If I can’t have you, no one will’, and lit a match. The former couple are said to have had a one-year on-off relationship, which began when his teenage son Nathan started dating Cailin. Potts and Jones’s relationship was apparently ‘stormy’ and police had reportedly been called to the house on several occasions. Potts is also said to have fallen out with Shaun last October and wrote him a message saying: 'Please read this before telling me to f*** off… I am sorry for what happened.’ He then wrote on Facebook afterwards: ‘Why is life so hard – you can’t live with them but you can’t live without them.’ After getting back together briefly, Potts and Jones split again in August and he posted on Facebook one month ago: ‘My life is s***. Lost my girlfriend and her kids.’ He added the following day: ‘Anyone with me to get my life back. Had it taken away, going to fight for it.’ Fireball: Pictured is Dave Potts who died after allegedly dousing himself in petrol and setting his ex-girlfriend's house on fire in Altrincham, Greater Manchester . Police have confirmed there had been . contact with Ms Jones, believed to be over unwanted attention from . Potts, within the last month. The matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Neighbours said they heard shouting and a disturbance at the address before it went up in flames. Tracy and Cailin tried to put out the . fire but the blaze ripped through the ground floor of the family’s . £120,000 semi-detached house. Firefighters stormed inside the property and carried out Shaun and Zach, who had been asleep in bed.

The British couple who managed to jump out of their motorhome before it plunged into a ravine in the Amazon jungle, said they were 'amazed' to have escaped unharmed. Intrepid explorers Bruce Scott, 62, and . Lesley Norris, 64, were left stranded hundreds of miles from civilisation when their Mercedes Unimog proved too heavy for a bridge they were driving over. 'Unfortunately the weight of the vehicle . was excessive and the bridge couldn't handle it,' Mr Scott told reporters in Manaus, Brazil, where the couple are recovering today. 'The vehicle simple . plunged into the river below.' But the couple, from London who have been touring Latin America for the past five-and-a-half years, have vowed to continue their adventures, with Mrs Norris saying: 'It has not put us off at all, we love travelling.' Cuts and bruises: Bruce Scott, left, and Lesley Norris, right, had a lucky escape after their motorhome plunged 30ft into a ravine before spending the night in the rainforest amid vampire bats and poison dart frogs . Instead, they instigated an . extraordinary trans-Atlantic rescue mission by ringing Miss Norris’s . brother-in-law 5,125 miles away in Eastbourne, East Sussex, on their . satellite phone. He took . down their GPS co-ordinates so they could be traced, then alerted Dover . Coastguard who in turn contacted their colleagues in Falmouth, the . co-ordinating station for international alerts, who duly raised the . alarm with rescue services in Brazil. A . helicopter was then scrambled to pick up the pair, but not before they had to spend a night under the stars in the sweltering rainforest, which is home to . vampire bats, poison dart frogs and black caiman crocodiles. Today, after being . flown to safety and checked out by Navy medics, Mr Scott explained how . their Unimog had collapsed a bridge on the remote . BR-319 road as they headed from Porto Velho to the jungle city of . Manaus. Epic rescue: Miss Norris stands by the doomed Mercedes Unimog. The couple instigated an extraordinary trans-Atlantic rescue mission by ringing Miss Norris's brother-in-law in East Sussex, on their satellite phone . The intrepid adventurers: Mr Scott and Miss Norris have been travelling around Latin America for five-and-a-half years . 'Luckily we were able to leap out before it fell,' he said before thanking the Brazilian rescue team and UK coastguard for 'doing such an amazing job'. Miss Norris added: 'I thought it was all over when the bridge started to collapse. It's amazing we escaped unharmed.' British Consul Vincent Brown said he would have advised the couple against making the trip if they had consulted him. He said: 'If they had told me about their trip I would have convinced . them not to take it, because of the risk and the road conditions.' Mr Scott and Miss Norris gave up their jobs . for a life on the open road in 2006. Miss Norris, used to live in the . suburb of Teddington and was a British Airways stewardess for 20 years. Mr Scott, who sold his studio flat in West Kensington to invest in . the Unimog - an off-road adventure vehicle adapted to include a double bed . and porcelain flushing loo -  was a professional photographer who has also trained as a . bus driver. On a website about their trip, on . which Mr Scott is pictured looking debonair in a pith helmet and white . tuxedo with his arm around a uniformed Miss Norris, they described how . they have visited Mexico and were attempting to drive the length of . South America. On her last blog entry before the . accident, Miss Norris said life was getting tough in Brazil, with . ‘unseasonably hot’ temperatures of up to 40c making it unpleasant to . sleep in the truck.

Jenny, 62, whose husband Ken answered their call, said the couple . managed to haul themselves out of the vehicle and ‘feel lucky to be . alive’. ‘Bruce helped Lesley to climb out and . then went back down and got a couple of chairs for them both so they . could sit on the roadside,’ she said. ‘He went back down and got some tarpaulin and they slept on the road, hoping to be rescued.’ She added: ‘When Ken got the call he just rang the Coastguard straight away. ‘The first thing I heard about it was . when I got home two hours later as he did not want to worry me. I am so . glad he picked up the phone because I would not have known what to do.’ Miss Norris and Mr Scott were picked . up by a Brazilian army helicopter yesterday and flown to Manaus, a . popular tourist destination because of its proximity to the jungle.

UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman Fred Caygill said: ‘It’s not the first time we’ve assisted people across the world. ‘This is a bit unusual for us as it’s . not of a maritime nature, but there are no boundaries in search and . rescue.’ The Foreign Office was informed of the couple’s plight and . offered consular assistance, while the Brazilian army last night said it . will recover the couple’s vehicle.

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 12:16 PM on 23rd September 2011 . No one could understand how Willow the cat managed to get from her home in Colorado to the streets of New York - even though she had five years to make the almost 2,000-mile journey. But now the mystery has been solved: Willow was flown on an airplane. A man came forward today to claim he knows the person responsible for the calico cat's magical mystery tour after a number of media outlets printed Willow's story, trying to offer an explanation as to how she could have travelled so far. Eyes have it: How Willow got to New York, which is more than 1,600 miles away, and the kind of life she lived in the city are both mysteries . The unidentified man - who said she was renamed Molly, told Gothamist.com: 'I had Willow (aka Molly) for three months, . while her New York owner was away for work. 'He fell in love with her on a ski . trip when she was a stray in Colorado, and flew her back to Brooklyn, . thinking she was too amazing to leave behind. 'She was vetted prior to flying, and none of her history came up. While . in Brooklyn she was loved and very spoiled ... she's had quite an . adventure, but there's no great mystery behind her travels. 'Willow is a . lovable cat who happens to fly well. She was brought to the shelter by . someone who loved her very much, but was unable to give her all the time . and attention she deserves. 'I'm sure her Colorado family knows how extraordinary she is, and I am so thrilled she's able to go home.' Journey: How Willow made the distance of more than 1,600 miles from Broomfield, Colorado, to Manhattan, New York, is still a mystery . Long trip: Willow disappeared from a home in Colorado, but was found on Wednesday in New York City and will soon be reunited with her owners . A photo was posted on the website of the cat in her Brooklyn home. Willow was found in Gramercy park . last week and her owners were located by a microchip which was implanted . when she was a kitten. Jamie and Chris Squires, of Boulder, Colorado, said they were 'shocked' to hear of her whereabouts. The family, who live near the Rocky Mountains, have two of three kids and one of two dogs who may still remember Willow. 'To be honest, there are tons of . coyotes around here, and owls,' Mrs Squires said. 'She was just a little . thing, five and a half pounds. 'We put out the ""Lost Cat"" posters and the Craigslist thing, but we actually thought she'd been eaten by coyotes.' The couple were ‘astounded’ when they . got a call from Animal Care & Control in New York City, saying she . had been found on East 20th Street. 'We put out the “Lost Cat” posters and the Craigslist thing, but we actually thought she'd been eaten by coyotes' Jamie Squires, Willow's owner . Mrs . Squires added that her husband told her not to tell their children . until they were sure it was indeed Willow that had been found. ‘Then we saw the picture, and it was Willow,’ she said. ‘It's been so long.’ Animal Care & Control Executive Director Julie Bank said a scanner found the microchip that led to the Squires family. Found: Jamie Squires said Willow escaped in late 2006 or early 2007 when contractors left a door open during a home renovation . ‘All our pets are microchipped,’ Mrs Squires said. ‘If I could microchip my kids, I would.’ 'All our pets are microchipped. If I could microchip my kids, I would' Mrs Squires . The . children are aged 17, 10 and 3 - so the older two remember Willow. Mrs . Squires said her 3-year-old saw a photo and remarked: 'She's a pretty cat.’ The Squires family also have a yellow labrador named Roscoe, who knew Willow, and an English mastiff named Zoe. ‘We . had another dog back then too, and I remember Willow would lie with . them as they all waited to be fed,’ she said. 'She thought she was a . dog.' Found: Jamie Squires, right, and Chris Squires, left, were 'shocked' to hear the whereabouts of . Willow, who had a microchip implanted when she was a kitten . Mrs Squires said Willow escaped in late 2006 or early 2007 when contractors left a door open during a home renovation. Jamie Squires was worried about a possible New York state of mind. 'I . don't know what kind of life she's had, so I don't know what her . personality will be like,’ she said. She described Willow when she . disappeared as ‘a really cool cat, really sweet’. Since then the family had moved about . 10 miles from Broomfield to Boulder, but kept its address current with . the microchip company. Ms Bank recommended that all pet owners use microchips. The ACC and the Squires family were trying to arrange for transportation back to Colorado and health certificates. They said it might be two weeks before the reunion. Willow may spend some time with a foster family in New York. ‘The kids can't wait to see her,’ Mrs Squires said. ‘And we still have her little Christmas stocking.’ Looking: Willow stares out from a cage at her temporary home on Wednesday in New York's Animal Care & Control facility, after her very long journey .","Cat went missing from Broomfield, Colorado, in 2006/7 .

Fogle and his wife Theresa Brown Fogle, 56, married in 2002 . and once attended Greater Faith Christian Center Church as members. But they had not been for several years and had started . their own ministry out of their house, regularly hosting their own Sunday . services. Today it has been revealed he pleaded guilty to manslaughter . in the death of his wife, Diane, but was only sentenced to 10 years’ probation . in 1987. He allegedly answered the door with a rifle and showed a . police officer her body in 1986. Prosecutors reduced the charge from first-degree . murder. He handled the rifle in a ‘negligent, . careless and reckless manner,' authorities said at the time. It's not known why the charge was lessened. Spree: Fogle allegedly stormed into Greater Faith Christian Church in Florida on Sunday morning, shooting pastors William Boss and Carl Stewart . On Sunday, Mrs Fogle's husband had allegedly walked to . the church from their home nearby. She was later found dead in the living room by officials. 'Of all the places you should be . safe, you should be safe in a house of worship. Especially on a Sunday morning' Sheriff Grady Judd . He entered through the front door of . Greater Faith Christian Center Church, walked down the centre aisle and . shot the men, police said. Fogle was then allegedly restrained by other parishioners until authorities arrived.

Derrick Foster was kneeling in prayer when the gunman burst through the front door of Greater Faith Christian Center Church and he heard shooting then screams. Mr Foster and another man tackled Fogle and one of the parishioners struck him in the head with a microphone stand, authorities said. ‘He had a great grip on the gun,’ Mr Foster said. ‘My plan was, as soon as he hit the floor, it would cause him to drop it. But he didn't drop it.’ He said it took up to four minutes of struggling with the gunman before he finally wrested the weapon away. ‘He was focused on killing his wife and . certainly meant to kill the pastor and assistant pastor,’ he . told the Orlando Sentinel. The pastor and associate pastor were . in a critical but stable condition and were being treated for their . injuries at a local hospital. Authorities took Fogle into custody on . charges of first-degree murder and attempted murder. They were . investigating to determine his motive. During a hearing on Monday, Fogle  was charged with murder and attempted murder after the shootings. He was ordered to be held without bond. The couple ran a transportation firm . and his wife had nursed him back to health after he had back surgery, . Mrs Fogle’s sister Maria Beauford said. ‘We have no idea what his motive was,’ Ms Beauford said. ‘We just have no idea.’ Fogle was known as a community man and could often be seen in his home's front garden with his wife.

"Mastermind of Grand National triple by Britain's favourite horse . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:29 PM on 19th September 2011 . Legendary trainer Ginger McCain has died at the age of 80. McCain is best known for training Red Rum - winner of the Grand National in 1973, 1974 and 1977. Real name Donald, McCain also won the National with Amberleigh House in 2004 and retired two years later. McCain's son Donald took over the stable from his father in 2006 and followed in his footsteps by training the 2011 Aintree winner Ballabriggs. Late greats: Donald McCain, who has died at the age of 80, pictured with Red Rum on Southport beach in 1990 . Red Rum, left, ridden by Brian Fletcher beats Crisp, ridden by Richard Pitman, for his first National victory, in 1973 . Red Rum, again ridden by Brian Fletcher, takes the last fence for his second Grand National win, in 1974 . Crowd pleaser: Red Rum, ridden by Tommy Stack, races into history with a third Grand National win in 1977 . McCain's wife Beryl said: 'Donald, Ginger as we all knew him, passed away peacefully in his sleep after a short illness this morning - he would have been 81 on Wednesday. 'There will be a private family funeral followed by a later memorial service, for which there will be more information in the coming weeks. 'Joanne, Donald Jnr and I appreciate all the kindness we are being shown and, at this difficult time, would appreciate it if we were afforded some privacy.' McCain began his training career as a permit holder in 1953 and took out a full licence in 1969 when his stables were behind his car showroom in Southport. He worked as a taxi driver to supplement his income as a trainer prior to finding Grand National success. It was as a taxi driver that he became acquainted with Noel le Mare for whom he bought Red Rum. Former . leading National Hunt jockey Mick Fitzgerald, who won the Grand . National on Rough Quest in 1996, has paid tribute to McCain. 'I'm very saddened. He leaves a legacy . and every time you think of the Grand National, you think of Ginger. He . was the National, to be honest,' Fitzgerald told Sky Sports News. 'If you ever wanted a controversial . quote, you always spoke to Ginger. He was never afraid to speak his . mind, he believed in what he was doing and he believed foremost in the . Grand National as a race. 'He was a great ambassador for our sport and racing needs characters like him. It's a very sad day for everybody and especially anybody involved with the Grand National. Not forgotten: Ginger McCain leaves flowers at Red Rum's grave in 2006. The legendary horse died in 1995 . 'He trained the legendary Red Rum to . win three Grand Nationals and he also won a Scottish National with the . horse. He wasn't just a one-trick pony. 'He was a real character who always had something good to say. He was a very interesting man. 'His son, Donald, has taken over the reins quite magnificently and won the National with Ballabriggs. 'The first thing Ginger said after the race was, ""I trained him well,"" and I think that just about sums him up. 'He leaves a great family behind him and I'm sure they'll be very sad. My best wishes are with them. 'Every time I think of him I smile. The Grand National will forever be remembered as his race.' Reigning champion trainer Paul . Nicholls added: 'Ginger will be sorely missed. He knew his horses very . well, he had an affinity with Aintree and he knew what it took to win . the big race. 'He was a top man with horses from the Grand National. Legend is the right name for him.' Family affair: Ginger McCain and son Donald with this year's Grand National winner Ballabriggs . He's done it again: Ginger with Amberleigh House after winning the 2004 Grand National . The 'voice of racing' Sir Peter . O'Sullevan commentated on all of Red Rum's Nationals for the BBC and . believes McCain played a big part in helping to save the race. 'It was a career of remarkable achievement and he has bred a good trainer himself,' he said. 'He will always be remembered for Red Rum and rightly so because he and the horse appeared absolutely at the right time and were very much instrumental in saving the National at a period when it was very much in peril. 'Red Rum had a remarkable record. Five runs in the National, three victories and two seconds - unbelievable. And then he won it again years later with Amberleigh House. 'It was nice for Ginger to have the opportunity to show he wasn't just a one-horse trainer. 'He was a professional curmudgeon and he goes behind leaving very good memories.' Former Aintree managing director Charles Barnett said: 'He was instrumental in helping to save the Grand National. 'At that time in the early 1970s . when Red Rum was winning his three races, Ginger was very supportive to . it (Grand National) and he got the public very much behind the appeal to . purchase the track. 'It was an extraordinary training . feat and an extraordinary horse he trained. But not just the horse: . Ginger himself was very important to the race and to the venue. What a performance: As late as 2004 McCain was training National winners, in this instance Amberleigh House, ridden by Graham Lee . 'He was a marvellous man who always spoke his own mind and he was always very supportive of us at Aintree. We loved him very much and the people of Liverpool did too. '(Amberleigh House winning) was another extraordinary event. It was in the last years of his training career and Donald was very instrumental in helping him in the training process. 'It was an extraordinary feat - not many people have trained four Grand National winners. 'He was very closely connected with Aintree and the Grand National and that is what he will most be remembered for. 'It's a very sad day and he'll be sadly missed.'",Mastermind of Grand National triple by Britain's favourite horse .

Chris Huhne has launched a scathing attack on the Tory hard right, bracketing them with the 'madcap' American Tea Party movement and warning they will 'wreck the nation's economy'. The Energy Secretary used his speech to round on Conservatives who 'slaver over tax cuts for the rich' and claimed if they failed to compromise Britain's economic recovery would be 'put in peril'. Mr Huhne's criticism is the most explicit verbal assault made from the conference platform by a senior Liberal Democrat on their coalition partners this week. Verbal attack: Chris Huhne has bracketed the Tory hard right with the 'madcap' American Tea Party movement warning they will 'wreck the nation's economy' He said: 'This coalition government saved Britain's credit standing by compromise. 'The danger if you don't compromise is now clear from America. 'There the markets looked over the brink when the mad-cap Republican right in Congress would not compromise with the President. 'Let that be a warning to the Conservative right here - we need no Tea Party Tendency in Britain. 'If you fail to compromise, if you fail to seek the common ground that unites us, if you insist that only you have the answers, if you keep beating the anti-European drum, if you slaver over tax cuts for the rich, then you will put in peril the most crucial achievement of this Government. Vince Cable, left, and Nick Clegg, both made explosive comments at the party conference, where both made swipes about the Coalition partners . 'You will wreck the nation's economy and common purpose. 'We are all in this together and we can't get out of it alone.' He added: 'Whatever we think of the . Conservative campaign in the alternative vote referendum, and I for one . thought that the vilification of Nick was appalling, for Liberal . Democrats compromise is not and cannot be a dirty word.' In a direct challenge to eurosceptic . Tories, Mr Huhne also vowed that the Lib Dems would not allow the . Government to weaken links to Europe. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, middle, gets to his feet with other party members to applaud Chris Huhne following his speech . The Tea Party movement in the U.S exploded in reaction to Barack Obama's economic policies. The anti-establishment grass-roots network is motivated by anger over the growth of government and budget-busting spending. Although the organisation calls itself the Tea Party there is some dispute over the name's origin. Some . insist it was drawn from the 1773 tax revolt known as the Boston Tea . Party, others say it's an acronym for 'taxed enough . already'. In 1773, around . 200 colonists, furious that the English crown was demanding payment of . duties on cargoes of tea in three British ships, stormed the vessels in . Boston Harbour and threw the boxes of tea overboard. The event protested what the colonists considered taxation without representation. Earlier this month new intake . Conservatives formed a group to press the case for repatriating some . powers from Brussels and Foreign Secretary William Hague admitted looser . ties could benefit the UK. Mr Huhne said: 'Being part of Europe is not a political choice. It is a geographical reality. 'It always was and until the tectonic plates break up, it always will be. 'We will not, as Liberal Democrats in government, weaken the ties that deliver our national interest through Europe.' The Energy Secretary's criticism . comes after a series of bruising comments made about their Coalition . colleagues at the Liberal Democrat conference, . Vince . Cable and Nick Clegg made a series of vicious attacks on ‘childish’ senior Conservatives yesterday as they sought to distance the Liberal . Democrats from their Coalition partners. Business Secretary Mr Cable's provocative speech blasted the . Tories on tax, banking and their close relations with Rupert Murdoch. Nick Clegg and Chief secretary to the treasury Danny Alexander applaud Mr Huhne's speech in which he rounded on Conservatives .

Dems to be ‘rude’ about them. And party president Tim Farron has described Margaret Thatcher's years in office as 'brutal and appalling', according to the Huffington Post. The strong words at the Birmingham conference signal that the Lib Dems are distancing themselves from their coalition partners. Some fear that senior party figures . are using the stage as a platform to present themselves as candidates in . a possible future leadership contest. Mr Clegg has dismissed speculation . that he might stand down in 2014 to become Britain's European . Commissioner, the Independent reported, but some of his party believe . that the option could remain open if the party's and his personal . ratings are still poor. Vince . Cable, Chris Huhne and Lib Dem President Tim Farron, have all been . identified as potential successors to the Lib Dem part leader throne . after their passionate speeches. Mr . Farron's rabble-rousing speech, where he suggested that a 'divorce' from the Conservatives may happen before 2015, has led to some Lib Dem .

It’s one of the biggest court cases the U.S. has seen in recent decades, so there were plenty of pictures taken of Casey Anthony as she sat in court and got led out of jail two months ago. But it turns out the 25-year-old is doing some snapping of herself while in hiding in northern Florida, taking pictures of landscapes and wildlife - as far away from other people as possible in the state. She is an avid photographer and is taking online courses, while also learning a foreign language because she may leave the U.S. once her probation is up next year, sources told People magazine. After court: Casey Anthony, 25, is reportedly an avid photographer and is taking online courses, while also learning a foreign language because she may leave the U.S. once her probation finishes next year . She was described by a Department of Corrections spokesman as ‘one of the most hated women in America’ following her acquittal on charges of murdering her two-year-old daughter Caylee. Anthony told an Orange County jail guard she had considered dentistry, fashion and law as career options - but did not like enjoy media outlets choosing the ‘ugliest pictures of her’, reported People. Last month on August 9, she received a batch of birthday cards on the day when Caylee would have turned six. They looked quite normal on the outside but were filled inside with hateful messages. ‘Caylee will never be six because of you, you horrible bitch,’ one hand-scratched message said. She is currently in hiding while on probation for cheque fraud. ‘She would love to go out to meet friends and do public things but she knows she can’t,’ one source in contact with her told People. Another source told People: ‘There are people out there who would like nothing more than to beat her up - or worse’. She has also been seeing a psychiatrist and grief counsellor. Mum and dad: The much-anticipated Dr Phil national television interview her parents, George and Cindy, did earlier this month has reportedly destroyed Casey Anthony's relationship with her father . The much-anticipated Dr Phil national television interview her parents, George and Cindy, had earlier this month has reportedly destroyed her relationship with her father. 'She would love to go out to meet friends and do public things but she knows she can’t' Mr Anthony said he is unlikely to ever speak to his daughter again after being so hurt by allegations put to him during the trial that he sexually abused her as a child. He denied the claims. But Mrs Anthony has always held the belief that Caylee drowned and her daughter knew where the toddler was buried and may have had help placing her body there. Caylee was the focus of a wide-ranging search after her disappearance in June 2008. Casey Anthony told police that a fictitious babysitter had kidnapped the child. The 25-year-old maintained the same story to her family until the child's skeletal remains were found in a wooded area in December 2008 not far from the home of George and Cindy Anthony. Dead child: Caylee Anthony was the focus of a wide-ranging search after her disappearance in June 2008. Casey Anthony told police that a fictitious babysitter had kidnapped the child . During her trial prosecutors argued that Casey Anthony killed the girl by smothering her with duct tape and later buried her to hide the body. 'There are people out there who would like nothing more than to beat her up - or worse' But defence lawyers suggested Caylee died from an accidental drowning in a backyard swimming pool. She was acquitted in July, but convicted of four charges of lying to police. She is currently somewhere in northern Florida serving a year of probation on a separate check fraud conviction. Authorities are keeping her whereabouts confidential for her safety. Despite her acquittal, Casey Anthony has been scorned by the public, and her parents - who at times have defended her - have not fared much better in popular opinion. Cindy Anthony said that while she believes her granddaughter drowned, she didn't believe defence attorney Jose Baez's assertion that George Anthony was there or helped cover up the death.","Casey Anthony, 25, acquitted in July of murdering little daughter Caylee .

Colonel Gaddafi in the months before the release of the Lockerbie . bomber,  letters and emails uncovered in war-torn Tripoli reveal. After he stepped down as Prime Minister, Mr Blair was twice flown to Libya on a Gaddafi private jet. He visited the dictator in June 2008 . and April 2009, when Libya was threatening to cut all business ties with . Britain if Abdelbaset al-Megrahi stayed in a Scottish jail. At one of . his encounters, Mr Blair took a billionaire U.S. businessman with him. The Libyans wanted to discuss a beach resort deal. More deals in the desert? This 2007 photo shows then Prime Minister Tony Blair meeting Colonel Muammar Gaddafi at his desert base outside Sirte south of Tripoli. It has emerged that Mr Blair met with the ousted Libyan dictator several more times after he left office . The revelation of the meetings will . provoke further claims that Mr Blair worked behind the scenes on behalf . of the tyrannical regime to get the bomber released. But despite admitting that Gaddafi . brought up the issue of Megrahi, Mr Blair strenuously denied having . anything to do with his release, saying it had always been solely a . matter for the Scottish Executive. Pam Dix, whose brother died in the . 1988 Lockerbie bombing, said: ‘The idea of Gaddafi paying for Mr Blair’s . visits is deeply offensive. ‘These new meetings are disturbing, . and details of what was discussed should be made public. I am astonished . Tony Blair continued to have meetings like this out of office.’ All smiles: Questions have been asked over Mr Blair's role in securing the release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the Lockerbie bomber . The emails and letters, in which . Gaddafi is referred to as ‘The Leader’, show that in 2008 and 2009, Mr . Blair negotiated to fly to the Libyan capital from Sierra Leone, where . he was promoting tourism, in a jet provided by Gaddafi. One letter was written on June 2, 2008, by Gavin Mackay, from Mr Blair’s office, to Libya’s ambassador to the UK. It said: ‘Let me begin my [sic] . saying that Mr Blair is delighted that The Leader is likely to be able . to see him during the afternoon of June 10, and he is most grateful that . the Libyan authorities have kindly offered an aircraft to take him from . Freetown to Tripoli and back to London.’ Terror: Police and investigators look at what remains of the flight deck of Pan Am 103 on a field in Lockerbie, Scotland, in this Dec. 22, 1988 file photo . Libyan rebels have been forced into a chaotic retreat after failing in yet another attempt to storm the Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid. Since taking the capital Tripoli last month, motley forces of the ruling National Transitional Council have met stiff resistance in Bani Walid and Gaddafi’s birthplace Sirte, which they must capture before they can declare Libya ‘liberated’. Anti-Gaddafi fighters have tried several times to storm Bani Walid, 95 miles from Tripoli. Yesterday’s failed attempt appeared to be among the worst yet, setting off recriminations among the attackers. NTC fighters said they planned for tanks and trucks with anti-aircraft guns and rocket launchers to lead the assault, but foot soldiers piled in first. ‘There is a lack of organisation so far,’ said a senior fighter. Meanwhile rebels and Nato warplanes attacked Sirte, Gaddafi’s birthplace. Civilian cars and pickup trucks poured out of the city, with residents describing water and electricity shortages amid street fighting. Another letter shows that Mr Blair took billionaire Tim Collins to the April 2009 meeting. Mr Blair’s events organiser Victoria Gould wrote to the British . ambassador in Tripoli, Sir Vincent Fean, to ask whether the former PM . could stay at his residence. She wrote: ‘If we were able to stay at the Residence, I know TB [Mr Blair] would be really grateful (as would we all).’ Sir Vincent wrote back: ‘Just to confirm that the residence is at your disposal.’ A week later, Miss Gould wrote in an email: ‘We have asked the Libyans . to collect us from Sierra Leone and bring us to Libya. In terms of . calls, if you could note that TB would like to do the following: a . meeting with The Leader (partly 1:1 and partly with Tim Collins).’ The meeting came a day after Britain . signed an agreement with Libya which paved the way for Megrahi’s . release. This happened in August 2009 after doctors gave him three . months to live because of cancer. He is still alive. A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘The . subjects of the conversations during Mr Blair’s occasional visits was . primarily Africa, as Libya was for a time head of the African Union; but . also the Middle East and how Libya should reform and open up. ‘Of course the Libyans, as they . always did, raised Megrahi. Mr Blair explained, as he always did, that . it was not a decision for the UK Government but for the Scottish . Executive.

A mother stole more than £14,000 from a junior football team after volunteering as the club's treasurer. Paula Smith, 46, admitted taking the money from Walton-le-Dale Junior Football Club, near Preston, Lancashire - a crime which almost bankrupted the club. She has been told that she does not have to pay back a penny - a move that has angered the club's authorities. The club was left with just £13.66 in the bank when the theft was discovered. Walton-le-Dale Junior Football Club representatives today claimed that Smith treated herself to holidays in the Caribbean, two new cars and designer clothes throughout her four-year deception. Smith, who coached the under-10s and acted as the club treasurer, was handed a nine-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to carry out 180 hours community service.

"By . Anna Edwards . Last updated at 12:21 PM on 19th September 2011 . Furious: Michelle Richards' right leg was needlessly amputate, but the surgeon has still not apologised . A surgeon who needlessly amputated a woman's leg in a shocking hospital blunder has escaped punishment from the General Medical Council. Amit Sinha, an orthopaedic consultant at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Bodelwyddan, carried out an above knee amputation on Michelle Richards' right leg in 2006 after diagnosing osteomyeltitis, a serious and potentially life-threatening bone infection. Mrs Richards, from Towyn, Conwy, already had a below-the-knee amputation on the same leg in 1995, partially as a result of her spina bifida. But, after the operation, subsequent tests - carried out at the insistence of the mother-of-three - found no evidence of the disease and Mrs Richards was told: 'Sorry there's been a mistake.' She then sued the surgeon's employer, the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, for medical negligence. At the turn of this year the health board paid out an undisclosed sum to Mrs Richards in an out-of-court settlement and she received a formal apology from chief executive Mary Burrows for the error. However she failed to receive a personal apology from the consultant. In January, after the case was settled, she reported him to the GMC. But last month, in a letter from its investigation officer, Tariq Massod, the GMC said it would be taking 'no further action' against Mr Sinha, the Daily Post reported. The GMC case examiners accepted that there was 'no evidence of infection' in the stump and that Mr Sinha had failed 'good medical practice' in not referring for a second opinion. They also said the amputation was not 'justified' and that his error could 'obviously be considered serious'. 'Having said that, this appears to be a single, isolated event and . there is a possibility that the claimant may have undergone conversion . to an above knee amputation due to subsequent neuropathic ulceration,' they added. The case examiners went on to note that Mr Sinha had shown 'insight and remorse'. Health chiefs at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd hospital in North Wales (pictured) apologised for a breach of their duty of care . They considered issuing a 'warning' but felt this would be a 'disproportionate response'. The finding has angered Mrs Richards. She told The Daily Post: 'The letter says Mr Sinha has 'shown remorse' but not to me. He has never apologised to me personally and as far as I can gather he still stands by his diagnosis. This is not even a rap around the knuckles.' She was also furious at the 'insensitive assumption' that she may well have lost her leg anyway, as she says she cared for partially-amputated leg. Before she lost the whole of her right leg she was mobile, could walk without the aid of a stick and push her grandchildren around in a pram. It was in 2005 that she began to experience pain and a rash in her 'stump' and was told amputation was the solution to stop the infection spreading. 'After the amputation I lost a lot of mobility and now need a stick to get around. I am now finding it difficult to play with my younger grandchildren the way I used to.' A spokesman for the GMC told the MailOnline that it did not comment on individual cases. Mr Sinha provided a written statement to the GMC through his representatives. It said: 'We would submit that this error of judgement is a single isolated incident and an unusual departure from Mr Sinha's practice. We note that the GMC's expert, Mr Macdonald, acknowledges that there is a possibility that 'patient A (Mrs Richards)' would have had to have undergone an above knee amputation at some stage in the future.' A health board spokeswoman added: 'The GMC have, at the request of Mrs Richards, investigated her complaint against Mr Sinha and found that there is no case to answer therefore the matter is closed. 'A full investigation was carried out during the litigation process and an apology has been issued to Mrs Richards by the chief executive of the health board.'","After op, tests found no evidence of disease and Michelle Richards told: 'Sorry there's been a mistake'

"By . Damien Gayle . Last updated at 8:15 AM on 14th September 2011 . A former scientist with Nasa has narrowly escaped the death sentence after he admitted trying to sell U.S. secrets to Israeli spies. Stewart Nozette was snared by an undercover sting operation launched after a tax investigation uncovered classified documents at his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland. In a conversation recorded in downtown Washington, the 54-year-old told an undercover agent posing as an Israeli spy: 'I've crossed the Rubicon ... I've made a career choice. 'I'm prepared to give them the whole thing ... all the technical specifications.' Sting: This frame from an October 19, 2009, . surveillance video  just released shows Stewart . Nozette as he attempted to sell secrets to an undercover agent . In court Nozette pleaded guilty to one count of attempted espionage, admitting he tried to provide Israel with information about satellites, early warning systems, retaliation strategies, communications intelligence information and major elements of defence strategy. Prosecutors said Nozette agreed to divulge secrets to what he thought was Israeli spy agency Mossad through a post office box in exchange for money and an Israeli passport. He took two payments - one for $2,000, the other for $9,000 - from the post office box in September 2009 in exchange for answers to questions about U.S. satellites. Nozette had earned high-level security clearances during decades of government work on science and space projects at Nasa, the Energy Department and the National Space Council in President George H.W. Bush's White House. After gaining a doctorate in planetary sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he made his reputation as a defence technologist working on the abortive Strategic Defence Initiative missile defence shield during the Reagan-era. He also helped develop a radar experiment that discovered evidence of water on the moon - a version of the satellite involved in the project is on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. Jailed: Nozette narrowly escaped the death penalty after admitting trying to sell U.S. secrets to Israeli spies. Prosecutors found no evidence any were sold . Nozette was recorded telling the FBI's undercover agent that the secrets he was revealing had cost the U.S. government anywhere from $200million to almost $1billion. He said he thought he should be paid one per cent of that cost - $2 million. Investigators learned that Nozette could be a potential spy after a search of his home in February 2007 in connection with a tax and fraud investigation. Nozette ran a nonprofit corporation called the Alliance for Competitive Technology that had several agreements to develop advanced technology for the U.S. government. But he was overstating his costs for reimbursement and failing to report the income on his tax returns. The search turned up classified documents, which he was not allowed to have unsecured in his home. Agents also discovered had Nozette sent an email in 2002 threatening to sell information about a classified programme he was working on to Israel or another foreign country. Investigators would not disclose to whom he sent the email, but said the FBI decided to conduct an undercover operation to see how serious his claims were. The agents said they found a willing participant, motivated by a desire for money and to flee the country and his pending sentence in the tax case. At one point in the recording of his meeting with the undercover agent, Nozette said he wanted to set up somewhere like Singapore because 'it's clean, it's nondescript, they speak English there' and doesn't extradite to the United States. He said he would leave his wife behind. 'She would ask too many questions,' he said in the recording. Respected: Nozette, centre right, at a press briefing at the Pentagon about the discovery of water on the moon in 1996 . Nozette was sentenced to 13 years in prison on Wednesday, after U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman said he was prepared to accept a plea-deal. Appearing in court in a prison jumpsuit, Nozette said he understood the charge to which he was pleading. He could have been sentenced to death had he been convicted of all four counts of attempted espionage that he faced. Prosecutors said Nozette told the undercover agent that he already had passed classified information to Israel through his consulting work for state-run Israel Aerospace Industries. But prosecutors could not prove Nozette gave the agency any secrets and he was not charged with doing so. 'We do not have any information he passed on classified information,' said Ronald C. Machen Jr., U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. 'We believe we thwarted that before it occurred.'","FBI believe they thwarted plan before any secrets were revealed .

Visitors to Vegas are hit with the constant noise of coins cascading out of slot machines and everywhere they look are opulent hotels and their rich residents, but the desert town that is guaranteed to shock has a very dirty secret. According to a new economic study of the 100 largest U.S. cities, since the recession 'Sin City' has become the single most dreadful place to live in America. Academics say although Vegas is undoubtedly the entertainment and gambling capital of the world nowhere has employment, business growth and house prices plunged further. Las Vegas has been voted the worst city to live in in the United States following an economic study of the 100 biggest cities in the country . This map shows the cities ratings from the survey, with 20 worst being coloured red and the 20 best being coloured navy blue . Many homeowners in the city have been ruined by a crash in house prices, which were an astonishing 64.5 per cent lower in June 2011 compared to the market peak of late 2007. And in the same period unemployment is up 7.5 per cent, employment down 13.4 per cent, and gross metropolitan product down 12.8 per cent. Economists from MetroMoniter used these four criteria to rank the worst performing, and therefore the most miserable U.S. cities. Riverside in California was rated the second worst city to live in by the survey, with house prices down more than 50 per cent . Sacramento came in third place in the survey, one of a number of California cities in the top 20 worst places to live . Aside from Las Vegas, every place in the top ten of the misery list is in California or Florida, proving that sunshine is not everything for its residents. Riverside, Sacramento, and Stockton, all in California, follow Las Vegas as the most depressing places with Cape Coral in Florida in fifth place. The rest of the top ten is made up of Sarasota, Palm Bay, and Miami, all in Florida, followed by Fresno, California in ninth and Tampa, Florida, in tenth. 'Our economy is stuck running in place and running out of breath,' said . Howard Wial a Brookings fellow and co-author of the report. 'There has been very slow growth in jobs and economic output, and house prices and wages are at dramatic lows.' The report, released today, shows that while there has been economic improvement in America, many cities are nowhere near recovery. Overall, employment rates rebounded from their low point two years ago in almost all of the largest cities, but only 16 have got back more than half the jobs they have lost since 2007. Stockton, California ranked fourth in the survey, one of four cities from the State in the top ten . Cape Coral was the only city from Florida in the top five. The city has seen employment drop 16.9 per cent, while the price of a home has dropped by nearly 60 per cent . House prices across America have hit new lows as in all the 100 metropolitan areas studied, house prices are still lower than at any time since the recession. Meanwhile the unemployment rate in June 2011 remained above six per cent in almost all of the large metropolitan areas and although they are lower than a year ago, all of the cities had higher unemployment rates in June 2011 than in June 2008. And since the beginning of the recession, wages fell in 51 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas and rose in 49, while more than half of the 100 cities had made a complete output recovery by the second quarter of 2011.","Apart from 'Sin City' every place in the top ten is either in California or Florida .

Mother-of-two Stefanie Dickinson allegedly sent sexually explicit messages to the 14-year-old boy after he  joined her family on a weekend camping trip. The 37-year-old is alleged to have offered to have sex with the teen telling him in one text 'Baby, I will rock your f****** world!' Her arrest has stunned education . chiefs and other parents at the school district where Dickenson serves . as treasurer on the Board of Education in the Ellicott District in . Colorado Spring, Colorado. Police . said Dickinson asked for the teen's cell number so she could send him . photographs from their weekend trip to Lake Meredith. The boy had joined her two teenage sons for the trip. The teen said a week later at the end of August  he started receiving text messages of a sexual nature. An arrest warrant revealed that the mum of two sent the boy a message saying she wanted to sneak out of the house to meet him. A deputy later found a text message on the boy’s phone from Dickinson that read 'I just want u,' the warrant said. Another text message sent from Dickinson talked about having sex, followed by 'Baby I will rock ur effing world!! Haha.' The sexting supposedly began after the boy joined Dickinson's family, including her two sons, on a camping trip to Lake Meredith, in Colorado . The text messages were discovered by the boy’s sister, who became suspicious about the relationship after she saw Dickinson talking to her brother and repeatedly hugging him . The arrest report said Dickinson would hug the boy after football practice and was heard telling him:'I'll text you later.' Another text revealed that Dickinson was concerned about the consequences of getting caught when she said to the teen 'You can't tell anyone about this at all because I could lose my family.' The victim also told deputies that Dickinson 'would always tell me I have a sexy smile.' School chiefs issued a statement to parents after Dickinson's arrest. The statement said:'The District is aware of the allegation against Mrs. Dickinson and we have no direct information at this time and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment upon it.

'Preparation is a snap, pour and drink, as long as I remember to take what I need from the freezer the night before.' The blog features photographs of a fridge stacked with bottles of breast milk. Curtis writes: 'The first day started at noon and I only drank 44 ounces, just over half of the 66 I need to drink to reach the target 2000 calories. 'I didn't feel hungry or overly full, just satisfied, and the next morning I didn't have the ""give me food!"" feeling I usually get in the morning. Preparation is a snap, pour and drink, as long as I remember to take what I need from the freezer the night before.' The blog was started by Curtis's wife Katie who said she stored up dozens of bottles of breast milk after the birth of her first two children who were premature. Katie, who works as a childbirth coach, said she had looked into donating the breast milk, but they were unable to give it away. She said: 'My husband offered to just drink only the milk in an effort to finish it up before we have to move. I liked the idea because then the milk wouldn't go to waste. 'We had no intentions of doing it for attention. A co-worker told us to blog about it and we thought it might be fun to share what my husband is doing.'",Man identified only as 'Curtis' is blogging about his diet .
"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 11:15 PM on 21st September 2011 . She fell apart on the witness stand - weeping, clutching her chest, gagging and gasping for air – when asked to pick up a gun she allegedly used to shoot her husband in their home. Barbara Sheehan, 50, of Queens, New York, is charged with murdering former NYPD sergeant Raymond Sheehan, 49, in 2008. However she claims he was an abusive, reckless and terrifying man. She shot her husband 11 times using two handguns that he kept loaded, prosecutors say. But she has pleaded not guilty, claimed self-defence and drawn the attention of domestic violence activists. Tears: Barbara Sheehan, 50, of Queens, New York, is charged with murdering former NYPD sergeant Raymond Sheehan, 49, and she fell apart on the witness stand during the trial on Wednesday (file picture) ‘I'm afraid I'm going to get sick,’ Sheehan said in court on Wednesday, barely able to glance at the .38-calibre revolver that lay on the witness stand next to her. ‘I don't want to do it.’ Sheehan was hammered with questions on her husband's life insurance policies and the moments leading to the shooting by Debra Pomodore, prosecuting, during the third day of cross-examination. Sheehan was often contradictory and claimed to not remember signing cheques her two children had written to her - proceeds from their father's life insurance policies. She said that they helped her pay the bills, but that she did not specifically benefit from the money. Her two children, Jennifer, 25, and Raymond, 21, have both said that their father abused them and their mother, and that they lived in fear of him. Together: Sheehan, right, claimed her husband Raymond, left, was an abusive, reckless and terrifying man . They are expected to testify at the . trial, and both wept with their mother as she composed herself in a . courtroom pew after she was asked to hold the revolver. Law in New York does allow people to defend themselves - but only to a certain extent. It is legal under state self-defence laws to kill a person if that is required to remove yourself or someone else from danger to your life or lives. However the law is only to provide protection - so New Yorkers are not allowed to assault beyond removing the threat someone poses. It could therefore be argued that you are only allowed to shoot someone to the extent where a dangerous situation is diffused. Jennifer Sheehan and her mother both wore purple to show support for victims of domestic violence. Many other women in the courtroom were also seen wearing the colour. Prosecutors tried to show on the shooting day in February 2008 Sheehan was not fearful for her life. She proofed her son's school paper, drank coffee and made travel arrangements for a trip to Florida. Sheehan claimed she didn't want to go with her husband on vacation but was pretending to out of fear because he had said he would kill her if she didn't come. The fight prompted the fatal argument. He dragged her out of bed the morning of the shooting and threw her out of the house in her pyjamas, saying she couldn't come back until she agreed to go with him, she told the court. Allegations: Sheehan shot her husband 11 times using two handguns that he kept loaded, prosecutors say . But she stood outside nearly an hour in the winter cold before agreeing to come. The . retired officer kept loaded his loaded service weapon, a Glock handgun, . and an off-duty gun, the revolver. Often he kept one holstered to his . side - and the other on his ankle. 'Living with the man I lived with, I tried to survive the best I could' Barbara Sheehan . ‘Living with the man I lived with, I tried to survive the best I could,’ she testified. Assistant District Attorney Ms Pomodore asked repeatedly whether Sheehan ever called 911 or a domestic violence hotline in the hours leading to the shooting. The answer was always no. After her husband got into the shower, she left to go to a friend's house, where she was frantic. ‘I didn't know what to do,’ she said. She went back home to get the $1,700 . in cash she had stashed in her drawer and said she planned to tell her . husband she was going to get dog food but never come back. Evidence: Sheehan is pictured in a grey jacket and white blouse at the Queens Supreme Court on Tuesday . She . saw the revolver in the bedroom, took it and walked to the hall. Her . husband was in the bathroom, recently showered, the Glock by his side on . the vanity table. That's when it happened. 'I don't know what I was thinking then - I was so scared. I thought he'd come after me and kill me. I could see his face, and his eyes, and . his hand and the gun. I . knew he was going to kill me' Barbara Sheehan . During . testimony, Sheehan was barely understandable through tears - her head . down, face in her hands, shielding her eyes from Ms Pomodore, as she . said he pointed the gun at her and she fired. ‘I don't know what I was thinking then - I was so scared,’ she said. ‘I thought he'd come after me and kill me.’ But prosecutors sought to suggest he did not point the gun at her, and noted he never fired. ‘I could see his face, and his eyes, and his hand and the gun,’ she said, her voice rising with every word. ‘I knew he was going to kill me.’ But Sheehan would not answer specific questions, such as where she was standing when the shooting happened and how she ended up with both guns. Team: Sheehan, centre, is pictured with her daughter Jennifer, and her defence lawyer Michael Dowd . She also refused to answer whether she later told her mother that her husband had been laughing at her with the gun, and that was why she shot him. ‘Was he naked?’ Ms Pomodore asked. ‘I don't know,’ Sheehan wept. ‘Was he shaving?’ she asked. ‘I don't know,’ Sheehan replied, later adding that she didn’t know what he was wearing either. On several occasions, Ms Pomodore asked Sheehan to show the jury how she held the gun at her husband, and each time she said she was physically unable to do it. The revolver sat on the witness stand, and Sheehan cowered from it. ‘Does this have to be there?’ she asked. ‘It's part of evidence,’ answered acting Queens State Supreme Court Justice Barry Kron. The trial continues.","Barbara Sheehan charged with murdering husband Raymond in New York .

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 4:40 PM on 23rd September 2011 . Killer: Robin Ligus has been detained indefinitely at a mental hospital . A convicted murderer who killed a pensioner in 1994 will be detained indefinitely in a secure mental hospital after a cold case probe found him responsible for killing two others in the same year. Robin Ligus, who was jailed for life for killing Robert Young in 1994, was told he will only return to prison to resume his original sentence if he is ever deemed 'fit and safe' to be freed from the specialist unit. The 59-year-old former painter and decorator, from Shrewsbury, was found responsible for the unlawful killings of both Trevor Bradley and Brian Coles by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court in July. The month-long trial heard that Ligus, who was desperate for money to buy drugs, killed Mr Bradley near Melverley in April 1994 by knocking him out and setting his car alight. Jurors also ruled Ligus committed the unlawful killing of Mr Coles, who was bludgeoned to death with an iron bar at his home near Whitchurch, Shropshire, in October 1994. But he was acquitted of involvement in the death of Bernard Czyzewska, whose body was found in the River Severn in Shrewsbury a month after Mr Coles’ murder. The serial killer, who watched today's proceedings via a videolink to HMP Woodhill in Buckinghamshire, was originally jailed for life in 1996 after admitting the November 1994 murder of Shrewsbury pensioner Robert Young. Victims: Robert Ligus was found not to have been responsible for the death of Bernard Czyzewska, left, but responsible for the death of Trevor Bradley, right . Victim: Brian Coles was one of three men found dead in 1994 . Ordering Ligus to be detained under the . Criminal Procedure Insanity Act for the unlawful killing of Mr Coles and . Mr Bradley, Mr Justice Treacy noted that both offences took place many . years ago. The judge told the court: 'They took . place in circumstances of considerable violence in the context of crimes . committed for gain... in the same timeframe as the brutal murder of . Robert Young. 'That sequence of events reveals a highly dangerous individual.' Ligus will be moved to a secure psychiatric hospital in Northampton within the next 28 days. West Mercia Police charged the father-of-three with the murders of Mr Bradley, Mr Coles and Mr Czyzewska in September last year after a cold case review into their deaths. Unusually, the defendant, who uses a wheelchair, was present in the dock for only one day of his trial, having been judged mentally unfit to take part in the proceedings. Because of Ligus's mental state, jurors were instructed to rule on whether he did the acts alleged against him, rather than being required to return verdicts of guilty or not guilty.","Court rules Robin Ligus to be held in a secure mental hospital indefinitely .

"By . Emily Allen . Created 11:28 AM on 20th September 2011 . In court: Noel Edmonds and his wife Liz Davies arrive at Bristol County Court . Television presenter Noel Edmonds is suing his former friend and business associate over a failed property deal which left him £500,000 out of pocket. The Deal Or No Deal star, 62, claims house builder and designer Ulrik Lawson, 50, owes him more than £370,000 over the bungled venture on a £2.1million country estate. The pair had bought Wood House in South Tawton, Devon together in 2006 and planned to build 26 homes on the site. They both put in £300,000 to buy the property with the rest supplied by bank loans. In total Mr Edmonds spent £572,000 buying and renovating the property. However, planning permission was never granted and when the mansion was sold two years later, Mr Edmonds says he got back just £52,000 after costs on the bank loans had been paid, while Mr Lawson received the full £300,000 he had invested. Mr Edmonds is now seeking to recoup £370,000 of losses incurred on the project. The quiz show host told Bristol County Court he had been 'betrayed' by his friend and said he had been promised his original £300,000 lump sum back. But lawyers for Mr Lawson argued that Mr Edmonds had knowingly signed legal documents to the contrary and had 'made up' his version of events. They claim he used the deal as a vanity project to revive his struggling television career. Mr Lawson has launched a £260,000 counter-claim against Mr Edmonds for unpaid building work on another home - St Surf house, in Exeter. The former Telly Addicts star angrily told the court he had been 'betrayed' by his friend. He said: 'I believed in my friend. It never occurred to me for a minute that I could be the subject of a betrayal. 'Ulrik and I were incredibly close . friends and the trust between us was tangible. He said I will give you . your money back first and I will take the hit. 'It was nothing but a financial disaster for me.' Mr Edmonds is seeking a six-figure sum from Mr Lawson over dealings on Wood House in South Tawton, Devon - pictured . The friends met in 2002 and Noel went to stay with the property tycoon after divorcing his second wife Helen Soby in 2004. Bristol . County Court heard that they both put £300,000 towards the purchase of . £2.1million Wood House with bank loans providing the rest. Planning permission was to be sought by Mr Lawson to turn the site into houses. Mr . Edmonds said they had a verbal agreement he would get his £300,00 back . from the project first but claims there was no legal document setting . out the arrangement. Taking the stand, Mr Edmonds wearing a dark blue suit, white shirt and purple tie, said: 'Mr Lawson put the project forward and suggested we put in £300,000. 'As the weeks went by I realised the vulnerability of my position, although I had total faith in my close friend. Ulrick Lawson, 50, outside Bristol County Court where he is being sued by Noel Edmonds over a property deal that went wrong . 'If he did not get planning consent within two years, I was powerless to recoup my money. 'But Ulrik said he was in control of the project and promised me I could have my £300,000 back first. 'The divorce settlement with my ex-wife had gone through and I had significant capital available. I had just signed a contract with Endemol for two years for Deal Or No Deal. 'But knowing the vagaries of executives I certainly did not want £300,000 taken up when I might need it in 2008.' The court heard that planning permission was not gained within two years and Mr Edmonds - whose name the house was registered in - sold the property. But after the bank loans were repaid, the presenter got back just £52,000, while Mr Lawson recouped £300,000 he had contributed. Mr Edmonds is now seeking to recoup £370,000 of losses incurred on the project. But Patrick Lawrence, representing Mr Lawson, claimed the whole deal had been a facade to help launch Mr Edmonds back into the public eye. He cited financial blows the host had received during his six-year TV exodus following the axing of Noel's House party in 1999, before the start of Deal Or No Deal in 2005. This included the calling-in of liquidators to company Unique Group - of which he was an 80 per cent shareholder - which left him facing a £1.5million debt to a bank. The court heard he had embarked on a number of ventures, including a video-conferencing business and even promotion of a Dutch fire extinguishing company. Mr Edmonds also confirmed he had sold his former 40-bedroom family home in Broomford, Devon, for £8.6million following his 2004 divorce. Mr Lawrence said the housing project was an opportunity to gain favourable media attention. He said: 'You were back in the public eye and it simply suited you to present to the public your position that you were 'bouncing back'.' Mr Edmonds responded: 'No. This suggests this was a vanity project on my behalf and I totally refute that.' But Mr Lawrence told the star: 'Mr Edmonds, you are not naive. You are an experienced man and a distinguished broadcaster - and have been for some time. 'You must know that if someone makes an original agreement that says 'x' and is invited to sign a legal document that says 'y', it is dangerous to sign that legal documentation. 'I say you are regrettably making up your statement about Mr Lawson promising you £300,000. 'You appreciated that because of the way the deal had been structured, that Mr Lawson was going to say 'I get my £300,000 first'. 'You did not like that and you decided to create a negotiating position by turning it upside down and simply making up this statement about you getting your £300,000 first.' David Holland, representing Mr Edmonds, likened the feud to a 'divorce'. He said: 'Both parties accept they were very good friends. It has gone very sour and is almost like a divorce. 'It is Mr Edmonds' case that he was wisely reluctant to join the venture agreement, but he was persuaded by the enthusiasm of Mr Lawson. 'Mr Lawson's case was that Mr Edmonds was extremely keen to join the venture after bad publicity - to re-establish his career.' It is not the first time Noel Edmonds has had made headlines as a result of a dispute. He was caught in a dispute with Lancaster City Council in 1994 when his Mr Blobby theme park in Morecambe - named after the cuddly pink character in BBC show Noel's House Party - shut down. The incident - branded 'Blobby gate' - cost the council around £2million. In 2008 father-of-four Edmonds also caused controversy after he claimed he would stop paying his television licence. The twice divorced presenter married third wife, Deal Or No Deal make-up artist Liz Davies, in Lower Slaughter, Gloucestershire, in 2009. She sat by him during the court hearing, which started on Monday. The civil case, heard in front of His Honour Judge David Wilcox, is expected to last for eight days.","Edmonds is suing Ulrik Lawson for £370,000 claiming he was 'betrayed'"
"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 4:58 PM on 15th September 2011 . Making driving tests tougher could help ease traffic jams clogging up roads across Britain, MPs claim. Members of the Commons Transport Committee say warning road users about impending congestion through real-time information systems could also be a cost-effective way to cut congestion. They are trying to get a grip on the nation's traffic woes without building expensive new roads or introducing a 'pay as you drive' road pricing policy - which was scrapped by the Coalition government. Tough: MPs think driving tests should be tougher to prevent road rage and ease congestion . The government estimates that the rising cost of congestion will cost the UK economy an extra £22billion by 2025. Launching the report called Out of the Jam committee chairman Louise Ellman told the Daily Telegraph the committee thinks young drivers must have more experience of all types of road conditions before they sit their test. She said: 'It's about having more responsible driving and not getting involved in bad behaviour and road rage. 'When the road narrows and two lanes converge into one people can start undertaking.' She said bad driving can lead to road rage and to drivers not focusing on where they are going. Jam: MPs think traffic congestion will cost the economy an extra £22bn by 2025 if the problem is not tackled . Ms Ellman said: 'Improving the way we manage road space so that the network runs more smoothly is vital to the prosperity of the nation. 'More must be done to improve driver behaviour and road safety through better understanding of and adherence to the Highway Code.' The driving test was introduced on March 13, 1935 . When the test was brought there were only 1.5million registered vehicles . The year before the compulsory test was brought in, there were 7,000 people were killed as a result of road accidents. Introduced as a safety measure, it saw fatal and serious injuries fall by 17 per cent within three years. Since its inception, the test has been adapted to reflect advances in car design and changing road layout. Hand signals were removed in 1975 and a video hazard perception test introduced in 2002. Since 1996, drivers have to pass the written Theory Test before they are able to take the practical driving test. In October last year independent driving became part of the test. She added: 'Much more can also be done to improve co-ordination between highway authorities and organisations undertaking street works to ensure local authorities use the best available technology to co-ordinate their road or traffic management activities with other highways authorities.' Other ideas to cut down congestion included giving drivers access to a free Highway Code app for their phones and sending leaflets to drivers when they renew their licences. The report also suggested drivers utilise the Traffic Programme button in their cars to get the latest congestion information. The AA'S Edmund King told the newspaper junction improvements and traffic light phasing should have been considered by the committee. He said a tougher driving test would do little to cut congestion. Last year learner drivers were asked to drive 'independently' without getting instructions from the examiner. The Driving Standards Agency said this allows the tester to look at whether the drivers can drive unsupervised.",Congestion will cost the UK £22bn by 2025 .
"By . Ian Drury . Last updated at 1:55 AM on 24th September 2011 . It was one of the most audacious plans of the Second World War. A crack SAS team was ordered on a death-or-glory mission to kill or capture one of the Nazis’ finest commanders at a French chateau in 1944. Snatching Field Marshal Erwin Rommel would be an ‘immense’ propaganda coup, the elite British soldiers preparing for the operation were told. However, the raid was abandoned hours before the four-man unit parachuted in. Rommel was forced to return to Germany after being badly injured when his car was hit by the RAF. The SAS War Diary 1941-45 includes first-hand reports from the special forces unit's disastrous first operation in November 1941, from which only 22 of the 65 soldiers who took part returned. Pictured, SAS founder Sir David Stirling poses with some of his soldiers in their desert jeeps . Details of the daring plot have been . disclosed for the first time in an extraordinary diary recording the . remarkable early exploits of the Special Air Service. The secret tome, . kept under lock and key since being compiled in 1946, has been published . in an effort to raise tens of thousands of pounds for UK special forces . troops – including dozens maimed in Afghanistan – bereaved families and . veterans. The 600-page limited edition volume, . weighing 25lb and bound in leather ‘liberated’ from the Nazis, has been . authorised to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the regiment. Only . 1,000 copies have been printed, with prices starting at £975. ‘The SAS War Diary 1941-45’ collects . rare and previously undisclosed photographs, top secret orders, . first-hand accounts and reports – many written by SAS founder David . Stirling – documenting the ‘Who Dares Wins’ regiment’s missions during . the Second World War. Newly released secret SAS records feature the succinct orders for an ambitious but unsuccessful mission to 'kill, or kidnap and remove to England' German commander Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (seen here in the African desert) in France in 1944 . Among the officers mentioned in the . journal is Paddy Mayne who led a number of audacious night raids and . became one of Britain’s most decorated soldiers. One of the most daring plots was the . strike against Rommel shortly after D-Day. A July 1944 order marked . ‘Secret’ states: ‘The following points should be borne in mind: If it . should prove possible to kidnap Rommel and bring him to this country the . propaganda value would be immense and the inevitable retaliation . against the local inhabitants might be mitigated or avoided. Such a plan . could involve finding and being prepared to hold for a short time if . necessary a suitable landing ground. ‘To kill Rommel would obviously be . easier than to kidnap him and it is preferable to ensure the former . rather than to attempt and fail in the latter.’ The order added: . ‘Kidnapping would require successful two-way W/T [walkie-talkie] . communication and therefore a larger party, while killing could be . reported by pigeon.’ Rommel may have escaped the SAS’s . clutches but he committed suicide three months later after being . implicated in a failed attempt to assassinate Hitler. Document: The original order for Operation Squatter, the regiment's first major mission . Sir David Stirling was captured by the Germans but escaped only to be re-captured by the Italians before being sent to Colditz Castle . The SAS was conceived as a commando . force to operate in secrecy behind enemy lines. Stirling, a brave young . officer, dreamed up the revolutionary tactic of using small, elite, . highly-skilled units to tip the balance of the war in North Africa in . Britain’s favour. The first mission – known as . ‘Operation Number One’ – took place on 16 November 1941. The aim was to . destroy squadrons of German and Italian aircraft based at two airstrips . in Libya. The operational order noted: ‘It is most important that the . enemy should be unaware of your having landed or of your presence.’ One SAS soldier, Parachutist Bennett, . wrote that before setting off the commandos were given a meal ‘fit for a . king... just like having whatever you wished before going to the . gallows’. But horrendous weather conditions meant the operation ended in . disaster. One plane was shot down, killing all . aboard, and those who landed uninjured couldn’t locate drops of vital . weapons and explosives. Only 22 of the 65 soldiers who took part . returned alive. Subsequent successes – including . forays into the desert to disable Luftwaffe planes – meant the SAS was . expanded. Commandos played a leading role ahead of the invasion of Italy . and the Normandy landings in June 1944, which led the way to the . liberation of Western Europe. Operating behind Nazi lines, the . troops helped the French Resistance disrupt German forces and provided . vital intelligence for D-Day. Despite its expertise, the SAS was . disbanded in 1945. But one unnamed soldier was determined the regiment’s . history would not be lost over time. He compiled an extensive scrapbook . of every document and photograph he could lay his hands on. He placed the diary under lock and key . and it was only discovered when he handed it to the SAS Regimental . Association shortly before his death in the late 1990s. Placed in the . regiment’s highly-confidential archives, only a few were aware of its . existence until it was discovered by a documentary maker.

Instructors look on as young recruits struggle with their parachutes . Dogs of war: An SAS soldier and his pet in action during the North Africa campaign . Colonel John Crosland, executive . vice-president of the SAS Regimental Association, said: ‘The diary is a . unique document and going through it is a very humbling experience. It . shows how extraordinary these men were. Their deeds were astonishing but . they are so matter of fact in their reports.’ The SAS was reprieved in 1947 as . military chiefs sought its expertise. Since then, the commandos have . fought all over the world, including the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan . and Libya. More than 20 SAS soldiers have been killed or suffered . life-changing injuries, including amputations, on sensitive missions to . disrupt the Taliban alone.

"By . David Derbyshire . Last updated at 12:19 AM on 23rd September 2011 . Even the most ardent fan of Blackpool will concede the seaside town has little in common with Dallas. Any tans you might spot on England’s North-West coast tend to come from bottles rather than hours spent in the golden Texan sunshine. And the only cowboys you’ll find on the golden mile are builders. But soon that could all change. In an extraordinary announcement, gas prospectors have revealed that the Fylde Coast of Lancashire is poised to become the centre of one of the biggest gas drilling operations in Europe. Towering prospect: Blackpool could turn into Texas-by-the-sea . Rich: Dallas grew into a hugely prosperous city thanks to the nearby oil reserves . UK energy consortium Cuadrilla Resources has discovered that Lancashire is sitting on one of largest reserve of ‘shale gas’ in Europe. According to results from its test wells, there are 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas under the ground, trapped in a layer of compacted mud. If the gas can be recovered, it could provide Britain with enough fuel to last 50 years, plug the looming energy shortfall caused by reduced North Sea gas supplies and create 5,600 jobs. And it could turn Blackpool from the leisure capital of the North, to the centre of England’s oil and gas industry — a Texas-by-the-sea. Two hundred trillion cubic feet is an unimaginably vast amount of gas. It is ten times more than all the gas known to be left under the North Sea. It’s one-fifth the size of the biggest gas field in the world, and the volume of 66,666 Royal Albert Halls. The prospect of 400 gas wells across Lancashire and thousands of new jobs — not to mention all those tax revenues — couldn’t have come at a better time for the Chancellor. But there is one problem: in gas and oil exploration, if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Protesters who gathered in Blackpool yesterday say shale gas extraction in Britain is untested, expensive and dangerous. The gas has to be exploded out of the shale rocks using a technique called ‘fracking’, which can trigger earthquakes and contaminate water supplies with toxic chemicals. In America, opponents have even claimed that methane escapes into nearby water sources and can emerge from bathroom taps. Commercial fracking is new to Britain, but the shale gas it releases has been known about for more than a century. In 1875, geologists sank a borehole in the Weald of West Sussex to investigate shale — a fine-grained rock made of compacted mud. During the experiment, a naked light was lowered into the hole which exploded dramatically. Serious research into exploiting shale gas got under way in the U.S. after World War II. By the 1990s, drilling technology had evolved to tap into the vast amounts of fuel locked away deep in the ground. Although shale reserves beneath the land are much easier to access than North Sea fields far offshore, the gas is harder to extract. North Sea gas forms mostly within sandstone. Once a drill has reached the sandstone, the gas flows up and out into the world. Shale gas is more obstinate, and stays locked away in the dense rock. Engineers must first drill straight down through thousands of feet of earth to reach the relatively shallow layer of shale, and then turn their drills sideways to bore horizontally. Vast amounts of water, sand and chemicals are then pumped into the hole under pressure — a technique called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Under this huge strain, fissures appear in the rock, allowing the gas locked up in the shale to escape along the bore and up the well to the surface. Until this week, the British Geological Survey had estimated that the shale under the North-West of England stored five trilllion cubic feet of gas. But the figure announced is beyond their wildest predictions. If Cuadrilla is right, it marks the start of a new age of gas production for Britain — and a lifeline for the economy. Within five years, some of the UK’s biggest coal-fired power stations will have been shut down under European pollution regulations, while by 2023 all our nuclear plants — apart from Sizewell B in Suffolk — will have been mothballed. Some of the resulting energy deficit will be met by the thousands of new wind turbines going up in the next eight years. But on a still, cold January day when the turbines are still, new supplies of gas could be invaluable. A new move towards for gas will be good news for energy security, too. With the North Sea gs fields running dry, the UK will become increasingly reliant on imports from Russia, Algeria and Qatar. But for all that enthusiasm, many geologists are already questioning Cuadrilla’s figures. Professor Al Fraser, an expert in gas and oil at Imperial College, London, said: ‘I’m sceptical about these numbers and I think they could be out by a factor of 10. There’s a lot of variability in these wells. It’s a classic case of the money going in before the science. We don’t know what makes a good or bad deposit, and we don’t understand the impact of fracking on the environment.’ Certainly, the prospect of exploding areas of rock underneath Lancashire has alarmed critics. On April 1, a magnitude 2.3 earthquake shook the North-West. It originated less than two miles from an experimental shale gas well near Blackpool run by Cuadrilla. A second tremor occurred on May 27 with a magnitude of 1.5. The epicentre was within 500 yards of the well. Professor Mike Stephenson, head of energy at British Geological Survey, said: ‘Our work seems to show that there is probably a link between the fracking that went on and  the earthquake. ‘But the quakes were minute in scale — on the edge of human sensitivity. If you pump high-pressure water into rocks that are already naturally stressed by pressure, it will tend to make them move. But it doesn’t mean catastrophic movement.’ The earthquakes may be alarming, but they are unlikely to be dangerous. However, growing concerns over pollution are more real. During fracking, chemicals such as benzene are added to the water to kill off bacteria that could clog the fissure in the rocks, and to improve the efficiency of the process. In America, chemicals have already escaped from badly-sealed shale gas wells. In 2008, researchers found benzene in a water well in Wyoming, close to a large gas field. Sceptics also point to the fact that fracking has already been banned in France, New York and New Jersey, as well as in Quebec and parts of Switzerland. Tony Bosworth, energy campaigner at Friends Of The Earth, says: ‘There are serious environmental and public health concerns over this. Britain has abundant renewable energy resources — the place we need to be putting our focus is wind, wave, solar and tidal.’ A predictable enough response, you may say. But there is no doubt a major shale gas development in England will meet with considerable opposition. That said, if in  the coming months geologists  confirm the claims made for the  size of this reserve, it could indeed prove to be a seismic development  for Britain.","The gas field in Lancashire could fill 66,000 Albert Halls .

"Execution is Alabama's fifth this year . Thirty-five inmates executed in the U.S. in 2011 . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:10 PM on 23rd September 2011 . A man convicted of the 1994 . execution-style shooting of a store clerk in Alabama was put to death last night - the . third U.S. execution this week. Derrick Mason, 37, was given a lethal injection and pronounced dead minutes later at 6:49pm at Alabama's Holman Prison. Strapped to the gurney, Mason gave a brief statement, apologising to the victim's family 'for the hurt and pain I caused' them. Executed: Derrick Mason was put to death in Alabama last night . He thanked the victim's father for getting in touch years ago and granting him his forgiveness. Just before the chemicals began coursing through the veins in Mason's arm, a prison chaplain held his hand and knelt and said a prayer before stepping back. Mason's breathing slowed, his head tilted backward and his lips pursed several times before he became very still. Minutes later, authorities closed the curtain on the death chamber. During the execution, the condemned man's mother, Maggie Mason, sat in the front row with her head bowed down. 'He's resting for the first time,' she said repeatedly. Later she held the hands of some other family members present and said: 'He's gone.' Jail: The execution at Holman Correctional Facility was the fifth in Alabama this year . The family of victim Angela Cagle issued a statement afterwards saying it hopes the execution stands as a deterrent for those who consider committing heinous crimes. 'We sincerely wish he had made a different decision ... then neither of our families would have been here tonight,' her family said. Mason was convicted of killing 25-year-old Miss Cagle in Huntsville on March 27, 1994, shooting her twice in the face at close range after ordering her to take her clothes off during an early morning robbery. Miss Cagle was found dead in the back room of the convenience store where she worked. An unidentified man later told police that Mason had committed the crime. The informant described the gun used, told police that Mason was 'out of control' and 'trying to make a name for himself', and then led authorities to Mason's car. Inside, police found a gun later determined to be the murder weapon. After he was arrested, Mason confessed, court records show. Mason's execution capped a busy week in U.S. death chambers. On Wednesday Georgia put to death Troy Davis for the 1989 murder of a policeman, despite an international outcry and claims he was innocent. In Texas, officials executed a white supremacist who dragged to death James Byrd Jr, a black man from East Texas. Mason was also the fifth person executed in Alabama this year and the third to die since the state changed the first drug used in its execution cocktail from sodium thiopental to pentobarbital. The change follows a nationwide shortage of sodium thiopental. Over the years, Mason argued that his constitutional rights were violated because he was initially arrested on an unrelated misdemeanour assault warrant and therefore the gun found in his car should not have been admitted into evidence in the murder case. He also argued that his confession was involuntary because he was subjected to improper questioning, intoxicated and hungry during the interrogation, psychologically coerced, and misled by law enforcement officers. Mason alleged that police interrogators grabbed him, pinned him down to his chair, and forced him to look at photographs, court records show. Mason had exhausted appeals by Thursday, including an 11th-hour bid before the U.S. Supreme Court.","Execution is Alabama's fifth this year .

"By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 4:34 PM on 26th August 2011 . The father-in-law of a missing Utah mother has today said that she would order him to smell her hair and pushed her breasts into his hands as he revealed more details of the sexual relationship he claims they had. Steve Powell alleges that he enjoyed a 'very sexual' relationship with daughter-in-law Susan Powell who disappeared in December 2009. Mr Powell said his missing daughter-in-law would frequently make passes at him and that they enjoyed 'sexual touching'. Scroll down for video . Mother: Susan Powell went missing from her hom in December 2009 and is now being described as a 'very sexual' person . Explosive claims: Steve Powell said he and his daughter-in-law enjoyed a very sexual relationship and that they were falling in love . 'I had a relationship with her that was probably beyond the pale, he told ABC News. 'When she was living at my house she would regularly come into my office after taking a shower.' He said that she would say to him, 'Smell my hair, I just shampooed it, it smells nice'. 'She would bend over my lap to let me smell her hair or come in and say I ""I just waxed my legs, feel my thighs, how smooth they are"",' he added. 'One day we were at an animal park with the boys. I was holding Brayden [her son] in my arms, she came over to take him from me and instead of just reaching out and grabbing him, she pushed her breasts against my hand, tightly.' Mr Powell called his daughter-in-law 'unstable', echoing by claims by his son Josh, who is the only person of interest named in the case. Family: Susan Powell shown with her two young children and her husband, Josh Powell . He told ABC News: 'Susan was very very sexual with me, . very flirtatious. She would do a lot of things to me, we interacted in a . lot of sexual ways. 'I think it is pretty likely I was falling love with her, and there is no . doubt in my mind that the feeling was mutual.' 'There was really a disconnect . between the Susan who was a faithful, loving wife, and the Susan who was . a very flirtatious, sexual being. 'Father-in-law, daughter-in-law . flirting with each other, maybe some sexual touching or whatever. And I . enjoyed it, frankly. Susan was a joy to be around in so many ways, not . just those ways,' he told Good Morning America. Josh Powell, 34, spoke yesterday as police investigating the disappearance searched the home of he shares with his father-in-law. He said: 'Everyone who knows me knows that I . would never hurt her and I would never hurt my boys. I would never hurt anyone. Emotional: Josh Powell fought back tears as he spoke about his missing wife, saying he was a good husband . 'I am a good dad and I was a good . husband. Though Susan was never unfaithful before that I know of, she . was a very sexual person.' He maintains that he left his . 28-year-old wife on her own when he took his two sons Charlie, then . four, and Braden, then two, camping in the middle of a blizzard in the . middle of the night, claiming that he simply tends to be 'spontaneous' and that the day was a blur to him. Mr Powell also described his wife as . an erratic and depressive person who contemplated suicide and would leave . the house in her underwear and walk down the street, a situation he . calls 'mortifying'. Steve Powell said his son was unaware of the relationship between he and Susan, saying: 'Josh wasn't aware of a lot of these . things at first because the first two or three years of his marriage - . it was really pretty much not something that really came to light. 'We interacted in a lot of sexual ways . because Susan enjoys doing that.' After the interview with GMA, Susan's . father Chuck Cox told the network that their claims are 'completely . false' and 'ridiculous'. Ridiculous: Chuck Cox said that Steve Powell's claims are completely false and it was him who made passes at his daughter . Speaking about Steve Powell, he said: . 'She told us a long time before they moved to Utah that he had made . advances towards her which she said made her very uncomfortable and that . her husband did not seem to care. 'She moved to Utah to get away from Steve.' Both Steven and Josh Powell are . trying to get her journals made public as they believe it illustrates . that she grew up around emotionally abusive parents and accused her . father of being a manipulator. They also said the teenage journals prove that his daughter-in-law is capable of walking out on her husband and their two sons. Steve Powell has said that the . journals, which stretch back to when Susan was a teenager, show that . she attempted to commit suicide and was 'lustful', and therefore could . have run off with another man. The allegation brought a furious . response from Susan’s father, Chuck Cox, who said he would fight the release of the pages. Mr Powell (left) is the only person of interest in the two-year investigation. Susan Powell (right) was last seen in December 2009 . He told ABC News : 'We . deny all allegations, they are just totally ridiculous and we’re very . disappointed and believe it’s unconscionable that he would first read . those journals and then think he had the right to publish them.' He said: 'They don't have authority to do it. If she is alive, . which they claim, she then still maintains control over her writings, copyright-wise. 'If they publish it, I'm prepared to take action. I have an attorney and we're waiting.' The . diary extracts show seven handwritten pages on what appears to be . school notebook paper, detailing events from Susan's life in 1996 . and 1998. Steve Powell . said that the documents prove that 'Susan is a lot more vulnerable . emotionally than Chuck and Judy Cox (her mother) would like people to . believe'. Further, the diary extracts show 'that Susan led a double-life from the time she was 13, 14, or possibly even 12,' Mr Powell claimed. Police widened their search to a network of abandoned mines in Ely, Nevada, but have not revealed any new evidence . The debate comes days after authorities searched a sprawling network of abandoned mines outside Ely, Nevada, but did not reveal any new evidence. The renewed interest into Susan Powell's disappearance comes after a remembrance rally for her descended into chaos on Friday as family members traded allegations in public. Chuck Cox has said that he will fight the release of his daughter's diaries . Tensions reached a boiling point between the feuding families as . loved ones gathered in Puyallup, Washington to pass out flyers and comb . for leads. Steve Powell confronted Mr Cox, calling him a 'liar' and a 'cyberbully'. The families are scheduled to meet in court today when Josh Powell will request a restraining order against Mr Cox. Mrs Powell was last seen at her home on December 6, 2009. She was reported missing the next day when she failed to show up for her job in West Valley City, Utah. Her husband recently told the Salt Lake Tribune that he is willing to talk with federal authorities, but not West Valley City police. He told the newspaper that he considered the search in Ely an opportunity for authorities to set him up. 'It occurred to me,' he said, according to the paper, 'they were planting something in Ely so they could magically show it to the media.' The FBI Utah office's spokeswoman, Debbie Dujanovic Bertram, declined to comment yesterday. Watch the video .","Susan Powell has not been seen since 2009 .

Three gap year students have been killed in a road crash in Thailand just days after beginning their ‘trip of a lifetime’. School friends Conrad Quashie, 19, Max Boomgaarden-Cook, 20, and Bruno Melling-Firth, 19, had saved for months before setting off from Heathrow on Thursday last week for a tour of South-East Asia. Their parents had warned them to stay away from drugs and motorbikes – but they died instantly early on Tuesday when the coach in which they were travelling from Bangkok to the northern town of Chiang Mai was hit from behind by a bus. Killed: (left to right) Bruno Melling-Firth, Max Boomgaarden-Cook and Conrad Quashie died after their bus was hit by another vehicle in Thailand . Rescue efforts: Rescuers tried desperately to rescue the trapped holidaymakers . Wreckage: The three men are said to have died instantly . Conrad, who had been due to start . university in Manchester with Max in September, had celebrated his 19th . birthday in the Thai capital on Saturday with his two friends and . girlfriend Elisa Smith, who then flew back to London. The trio set off on Monday by overnight bus for the north, planning to go trekking in the hills to visit tribal villages. Tragedy struck shortly after . midnight. Some 40 passengers from all over the world were injured, . including another Briton who is still in hospital. Last night distraught relatives paid . tribute to the adventurous boys who all had promising futures when they . left Charter School in Dulwich, South London, last year after finishing . their A-levels. Conrad’s mother Amanda Bean, 48, an . English teacher, said at her home in nearby Denmark Hill: ‘Conrad was . due to go to Manchester Metropolitan University in September with his . friend Max who also died in this tragic accident. Chiang Mai: The boys had been heading to the northern Thai city, 422 miles north of Bangkok . The Charter School is Dulwich was founded in 2000 after a campaign by parents in the area that there was no state secondary school to cater for their children. It is a mixed, non selective comprehensive with around 1,000 pupils, located on the borders of Dulwich and Camerberwell. It was built on the site of two former schools encompassing the old buildings, with new additions, including a sports hall. The school now has two specialisms - science and business - and is classified as a High Performing Specialist school. Ofsted has also described the school as 'outstanding' on two occasions following inspections. The school was given national exposure in 2004 when Tony Blair made a visit to publicise the then government's five-year plan for education. ‘They were inseparable friends and . they had even applied to live in the same hall of residence.’ Conrad was . due to study history. Miss Bean, who is separated from . Conrad’s father Paul Quashie, 47, a computer financial analyst, said the . families had met   before the trip to talk about the possible dangers . on holiday. ‘We drummed into them not to hire . motorbikes, to stay away from drugs, and not do anything silly,’ she . said. ‘But than they have had this terrible accident. It was not their . fault and there was nothing they could do about it.’ She added that a friend of the boys . who had survived the crash, a 19-year-old called Jack, had returned to . London and told the parents the accident was over very quickly and . ‘there was nothing the boys would have known about it’. Max’s father Gerhard Boomgaarden, 48, . who works in publishing, said at his home in Herne Hill, South London: . ‘I am absolutely devastated. I did not know human bodies could produce . so many tears. It is such an intense pain that will never go away. ‘He was such an incredibly bright boy with a big future ahead of him.’ Max was due to study history and politics and was a regular volunteer for a leukaemia charity. His father said he had been planning . the nine-week tour of Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia for years. Mr . Boomgaarden said: ‘A few years ago he said to me, “Dad, before I am . twenty I will have travelled around South-East Asia”. ‘It was a dream of his. I never . dreamt he would be coming back in a metal container. The one consolation . is I understand their deaths were instantaneous. ‘Just the day before the accident I . received an email from Max and he said they were all having a wonderful . time. The thing is, he said how much he loved me, and he signed it with . ten kisses.’ School friends: All three of the gap year students were pupils at The Charter School in Dulwich, South London . Mr Boomgaarden said Max’s stepmother . Madeleine was also distraught, as well as his brothers Leo, 16, and . Ivan, six, and stepbrother Leon, 13. Max’s mother Polly Cook, who lives . nearby, was so upset she could ‘barely talk’. Bruno’s mother Gillian Melling, who lives in Central London, was too upset to speak. David Sheppard, head teacher at The . Charter School, said the teenagers were ‘delightful young people’ who . had joined in the sixth form. ‘They settled in very quickly and . they were really well liked amongst the community,’ he said. ‘They were . credits to their families and they were really looking forward to making . a contribution to society.’","Victims named as Conrad Jame Quashie, Maximilian Hugo Ulrich Boomgaarden-Cook and Bruno Albert Melling-Firth .

Rescue workers dug through mudslides as they struggled today to reach thousands of villagers cut off by a powerful earthquake that killed at least 53 people and damaged more than 100,000 homes in mountainous north-eastern India, Nepal and Tibet. Heavy rains slowed the relief effort and made conditions miserable for many homeless villagers as they prepared to spend the night outside. Three emergency workers were killed in the frantic rescue effort, Indian Home Secretary RK Singh said. Hole in the wall: huvadra Pathi looks out from her apartment after a section of it collapsed in an earthquake in Kathmandu . Search for survivors: Nepalese police search for casualties in the ruins of a quake-damaged house at Lokanthali in Bhaktapur . More than 6,000 army and paramilitary troops were working to clear concrete slabs, bricks and mud to rescue scores of people trapped under houses that collapsed when the 6.9-magnitude quake struck the Himalayan region yesterday evening. Nine helicopters dropped food to villages, airlifted a medical team, evacuated the injured and conducted damage assessments, Singh said. Heavy construction equipment was used to clear some of the blocked roads, he said. 'The rescue and relief operations are in full swing though they were hampered ... by poor weather,' Mr Singh said. Collapse: Locals congregate by a house after a wall came down in the quake . Structural damage: Two women look from a window in Bhaktapur which was badly cracked in the quake . By midday today, workers had managed to clear mudslides from one lane of the main highway leading to the Indian state of Sikkim, where the quake was centred near the Nepal border, Singh said. An initial convoy of 75 paramilitary soldiers started moving toward Mangan, the village closest to the epicentre, but still had not arrived by evening. At least 32 people died and 100 others were injured in Sikkim, Singh said. At least 10 of them worked for the same hydroelectric project, but it was not immediately clear how they died. Seven other people were killed in the neighbouring Indian states of Bihar and West Bengal, Mr Singh said. Victims: Two adults and a child died in Kathmandu when the British Embassy wall fell during the quake . Crushed: Members of the Nepalese army gather around a damaged car after the wall surrounding the British Embassy in Kathmandu collapsed . China's official Xinhua News Agency reported seven deaths and 24 injuries in Tibet. It said the quake triggered hundreds of landslides that disrupted power and water supplies. Nepal's government said seven people died there, including two men and a child who were killed when a brick wall toppled outside the British Embassy in the capital, Kathmandu. Nearly 70 people were injured, some of them seriously, and were in hospitals across Nepal. Most of the deaths in India occurred when houses, already weakened from recent monsoon rains, collapsed due to the force of the quake. More than 100,000 homes were damaged in Sikkim state alone, state officials said. Rescue mission: Nepalese troops on the streets of Kathmandu after the quake hit last night with a magnitude of 6.9 . Mr Singh said it was still unclear what the final toll might be. 'There may still be villages where people are trapped under collapsed houses that we have not been able to reach,' he said. TV broadcasters showed footage of buildings buckled, pavements cracked and two major roads collapsed in Gangtok, Sikkim's capital, 40 miles south-east of the quake's epicentre. Police cordoned off the office of the state's top elected official after the building was severely damaged, police Chief Jasbir Singh said. In West Bengal state, utility workers toiled to restore power to a large . swathe of the state which plunged into darkness after power lines were . snapped by the quake.

There will be no mail delivery on Saturdays and the U.S Postal Service could sell non-postal products if President Obama's newly unveiled plan to save the agency more than $20 billion goes ahead. The plan would also involve refunding $6.9 billion the mail carrier says it overpaid into a federal retirement fund and restructuring a massive annual payment to prefund health benefits for retirees. While Congressional lawmakers are in favour of a five-day mail delivery service, the proposals still could face opposition. Reduced service: There will be no mail delivery on Saturdays if Obama's controversial plan to save the struggling postal service $20 billion goes ahead . Republican Darrell Issa has refused to consider revamping the prepayment or returning retirement fund money. Issa, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee, has offered an amendment that he says brings the savings in his USPS bill to more than $10 billion per year through cuts and restructuring. Lawmakers in Congress have already agreed on the need to overhaul the agency, but several bills take different approaches. Issa's plan, which allows USPS to override contracts and cut the workforce, could spark arguments in Congress when a subcommittee takes up the bill on Wednesday. Big changes: The plan would refund $6.9 billion the mail carrier says it overpaid into a federal retirement fund . The Postal Service has watched its core business of delivering mail plummet as consumers send email and pay bills online. The agency has said it will be unable to deliver mail by the end of next summer if it does not downsize drastically. ""The administration recognizes the enormous value of the U.S. Postal Service to the nation's commerce and communications, as well as the urgent need for reform to ensure its future viability,"" a White House document states. Controversial: Many lawmakers in Congress back five-day mail delivery, but the plan's proposals still could face opposition in Washington . The Postal Service relies on revenue from stamps, packages and other services, not tax dollars, to fund its operations. The agency lost more than $3 billion last quarter. The agency expects to default on the $5.5 billion retiree health payment due at the end of September unless Congress provides relief. Lawmakers have indicated they want to extend the due date for the payment. Issa's bill would end Saturday mail and set up groups to close facilities and cut costs if the agency misses payments. The amendment doubles the amount the agency would have to save by closing processing facilities and phases out delivery to front-door mail slots. The plan to rescue the ailing service, introduced alongside a deficit-reduction package, would refund the $6.9 million it claims it overpaid into a federal retirement fund.","Saturday mail delivery could be scrapped .

Thousands of female workers could now win payouts after Sheffield city council agreed on an undisclosed out-of-court settlement with 900 women. The individual payments are thought to range from around ‘a couple of hundred pounds to tens of thousands’, a union source has said. Payout on the menu: 900 dinner ladies and woman carers and cleaners have won an epic battle for equal pay (library image) If the council had gone to court and lost, they would have had to pay £20million in compensation. The settlement came after unions claimed that woman workers had been discriminated against by the council for years. Female workers had also been excluded from a bonus scheme which employees in predominately male roles such as street cleaners and gardeners had received. They also argued that their pay packet was far less than their male counterparts, in some cases by up to £10,000 per year. Alan Hughes, from the union Unison, told the BBC: ‘They could have settled for probably half what it is going to cost them now.’ He added that he was ‘disappointed’ that is had taken three years for the council to finally settle. One council care worker of 24 years, Diane Wragg, said: ‘This is great news. A lot of people will be really happy. Compensation: Sheffield city council (pictured) agreed on an undisclosed out-of-court settlement with 900 women . ‘It was one of the first test cases to go to tribunal in 2005 and it is something that has been a very long time coming. ‘We stuck with this case because there were a lot of inequalities. Men were being paid more and getting bonuses.’ Sheffield Council’s director of human resources, Julie Toner, would not reveal the amount of compensation, but did confirm that a settlement had been agreed on. ‘The terms of the settlement are confidential so we will not be making further comment suffice to say we are content this has now been settled’, she said. General secretary of Unison, Dave Prentis, told the Daily Mirror last night that 40,000 similar cases around the country had been awaiting the court hearing. He said: ‘It makes sense the council has seen fit to pay women fairly.’ The council, which needs to save £220million in the next four years, says there will be no impact on finances due to the settlement and council taxpayers will not be affected.",School staff among 900 carers and cleaners to benefit after deal with Sheffield city council .
"By . Paul Bentley . Last updated at 10:08 PM on 19th September 2011 . John F. Kennedy feared his son's obsession with flying would end in tragedy and warned the Secret Service to ease his security because 'nobody is going to shoot me,' newly released tapes have revealed. In a startling premonition of his son's death, the President told an aide that he was worried about the time 'when he's old enough and wants to learn to fly'. Tragically, he was far less accurate when predicting his own end, giving the Secret Service orders to 'relax' the levels of protection he was receiving after election in 1960 because 'nobody is going to shoot me'. Moments before: This picture shows JFK and Jackie in the car just before the fatal shooting . Terrifying: Jackie scrambles away atop the moving car as JFK slumps inside after being shot . John F. Kennedy was infamously murdered while driving through Dallas in November 1963, collapsing in the back of his car, into his wife’s blood-splattered arms. His son was killed when a plane he was piloting crashed into the Atlantic off Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, in 1999. Killed: John F. Kennedy Jr. was piloting a plane which went down over the Atlantic . JFK's opinions about his and his son's safety have emerged from a series of lost ’60s audio tapes unveiled by Helen O’Donnell, the daughter of the former president's aide Kenneth O'Donnell. In . an article released this week, Miss O'Donnell quotes her father saying . JFK was worried about his son's fascination with flying. 'John [Jr.] loved helicopters,' he said. 'He would race over and get on a helicopter, and when it was . time for us to leave, he refused to get out of it ... The poor Secret . Service would take John kicking and squabbling off the helicopter or the . plane. 'The president said to me: ""The real question I’m going to have . to face is when he’s old enough and wants to learn to fly"".' Kennedy was just 38 when a plane he was piloting went into the Atlantic off Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. The 1999 crash killed him, his wife Carolyn, 33, and her sister Lauren. Investigators said the probable cause was his ‘failure to maintain . control of the aeroplane’. In the article written by Miss . O'Donnell, published in Town and Country magazine, she also discusses . her father's account of how JFK viewed his own safety as president. Predicted: John F. Kennedy, Jr. looks over his new aeroplane at the Hyannis Airport September 7, 1998 in Massachusetts . When the Secret Service boosted his . protection after he won the election in 1960, the president is said to . have told Mr O'Donnell: 'They’re making me uncomfortable.

The article has been published just . days after fresh light was shed on the Kennedys, with the release of . audio tapes of Jackie being interviewed in the months after her . husband's death. The tapes have been deemed surprisingly forthright for a woman who was never previously known for her opinions. 'Did she really think that?': Jackie O's grandchildren 'absolutely horrified' by her antiquated views on women . Even her own family have been shocked - . with her granddaughters said to have been 'absolutely horrified' by the . former First Lady's old fashioned views of the role of women. In the 1964 interviews with Arthur . Schlesinger Jr., the young widow described her marriage as 'a rather . terribly Victorian or Asiatic relationship' and said she borrowed all . her opinions from her husband. She also said she didn't believe women should be politicians and described being subordinate to her husband on principle. Doting: Jackie Kennedy looks after her husband, President John F. Kennedy . American royalty: Jackie portrays her marriage as blissfully happy, but admits that her husband did have a 'crude' side . If the couple argued, 'I'd rush and say I'm so sorry. He loved that, because it's hard for men to make up first,' she said. Rose and Tatiana Schlossberg, 23 and 21, who attended Harvard and Yale, were so shocked they asked their mother: 'Did she really think that?' Liberal America has been shocked by the book of transcripts published . today, which offer unique insight into Jackie Kennedy's views while and just after she was the First Lady. In the tapes, she offers catty opinions . on a host of the era's major personalities, including fellow political . wives and Martin Luther King.

The RAF pilot was taking part in a meet-and-greet with fans of the display team and is seen smiling as he is joined by enthusiast Samantha Barnes at a static display at the Bournemouth Air Festival. The photograph emerged after it was claimed Flight Lieutenant Egging may have crashed when a bird hit his jet after Saturday's display over Bournemouth, Dorset. The famous squadron has now been grounded 'for weeks' according to an RAF source as the investigation into the crash continues. Meet and greet: Red Arrows pilot Jon Egging pictured with fan Samantha Barnes on the day before he died . Under investigation: The plane was left as a twisted heap of metal. Remains at the crash site suggest a 'catastrophic bird strike', said a senior RAF source . Jon and Emma Egging, 32, on their wedding day last June in their local village church in Morcott, Rutland. Hours after the crash she paid tribute to the 'exemplary pilot' The body of the pilot was found in the River Stour, close to the seaside town's airport . Investigators have discovered remains . at the crash site which suggest a ‘catastrophic bird strike’, a senior . RAF source said yesterday. This could have extinguished the flame in the Hawk T1 jet’s engine – known as a flame out – resulting in a total loss of power. The possible theory behind the tragic crash emerged as Flight Lieutenant Egging’s family suggested he crashed after being knocked unconscious during the jet’s final seconds. A post-mortem examination of his body today revealed he died of multiple injuries. The 33-year-old is said to have steered the Hawk away from houses before it crashed into the bank of a river as his wife watched on in horror. The Red Arrows had just completed a display at the Bournemouth Air Festival when the single-engine jet went out of control as they returned to the seaside town’s airport on Saturday afternoon. Witnesses yesterday told how they found the body of the pilot, known as ‘Eggman’, face down in the River Stour. His ejector seat and helmet were nearby, while his parachute was also in the water. Flight Lieutenant Egging’s grandmother said relatives have been told . the pilot may have been unable to eject from the stricken jet because of . the huge G-forces  encountered when he banked at too sharp an angle. The pilot managed to set the Hawk on a . path away from homes in the nearby village of Throop, and issued a . Mayday call and is thought to have been thrown from the wreckage on . impact. Doris Egging, 88, . from Southam, Warwickshire, said: ‘Jon was a hero but he probably didn’t . eject because he was unable to after being knocked out. Wreckage: Part of the Red Arrow that plunged to the ground . ‘I spoke to my son, Jon’s father Philip, and he sounded ill. He couldn’t take it in. ‘I’m . told they were coming back at quite a height and this may have sent . Jon’s plane out of control. Philip was told Jon was higher than he . should have been when he banked. ‘I would very much believe he would sacrifice his own life to save others, that’s the way he was.’ Flight . Lieutenant Egging, who grew up in the nearby village of Ufton, joined . Southam’s Air Training Corps at 13. He was awarded a Royal Air Force . bursary while at Southampton University, and joined in 2000. In . 2009 he completed a tour of duty in Afghanistan, flying a Harrier GR9 . in support of ground forces. All Red Arrows pilots must complete at . least one tour in order to join the elite display team. Mrs Egging added: ‘He survived some . hairy moments out there, by all accounts. It’s a terrible irony that he . survived that, only to lose his life now. ‘But flying with the Red Arrows was his dream. He was so proud, as we all were of him.’ The . pilot and his wife, Dr Emma Egging, 32, an academic at the British . Museum, married last June in their local village church in Morcott, . Rutland. Hours after Saturday’s crash, the widow issued a moving tribute to the ‘exemplary pilot’, and said: ‘Watching him today, I was the proudest I’ve ever been. I loved everything about him’. He was inspired to fly by his father, Philip, 59, a retired BA pilot. Both his father, who lives with second wife Linda, 53, in Alcester, Warwickshire, and mother, Dawn, a university administrator, 59 today, who still lives in Ufton, have travelled to Bournemouth.

There was nothing I could do.’ Elite: The Red Arrows on Saturday before the devastating crash . Mr Woods described hearing a spluttering noise from the plane seconds before it hit the ground. Yesterday, a senior RAF source said that investigators revealed they had found bird remains at the crash site.

"By . Rebecca Camber . Last updated at 1:16 PM on 20th June 2011 . Brian Haw has died during treatment for lung cancer . An anti-war campaigner who spent ten years camped outside the Houses of Parliament has died of lung cancer. Brian Haw, 62, set up his ramshackle site in June 2001 as a one-man protest against British military action in Iraq and, later, Afghanistan. He became a familiar face to MPs and a hero to civil rights campaigners, but his tent and collection of horrific pictures of war victims, accompanied by slogans such as ‘baby killers’, offended many. But Mr Haw and his followers fought off all legal attempts to remove the camp from Parliament Square, although he was limited in the hours he could use a megaphone to attack government policies. It began as a response to economic sanctions and British and American bombing raids on Iraq, but his angry messages daubed on hand-written posters grew after the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. This month he marked ten years living on the square. The protester died in Germany on Saturday where he had been receiving treatment. Yesterday . his devastated family paid tribute to the father of seven, releasing . this statement: ‘It is with deepest regret that I inform you that our . father, Brian, passed away this morning. Persistent protest: Mr Haw kept up his campaign for more than a decade, marking the tenth anniversary of his camp just three weeks ago . Sucessive attempts to move Brian Haw frim his makeshift camp failed afterthe High court said it would be a breach of his human rights. In 2002, Westminster City Council tried to prosecute Mr Haw for causing an obstruction, but the case was thrown out after it was ruled that camp banners did not impede the public. And even when politicians amended the law to outlaw unlicensed protests, Mr Haw was able to keep up his campaign thanks to a legal loophole. In the 2005 general election Mr Haw stood as a candidate in the Cities of London and Westminster in order to further his campaign. He won 298 votes, making a speech against the ongoing presence of UK troops in Iraq at the declaration of the result. Last year, bailiffs moved on a number of other protest groups from Parliament Square Gardens, but again Mr Haw escaped eviction because he was camped on the pavement, not the lawn. He was also arrested last year when police carried out security sweeps in the area ahead of the Queen's Speech. And in April Mr Haw faced another battle when officials tried to evict the huddle of tents, tarpaulin and placards - described by some as 'an eyesore' - ahead of the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton at nearby Westminster Abbey. ‘As you know he was battling lung cancer, and was having treatment in Germany. ‘He left us in his sleep and in no pain, after a long, hard fight.’ Supporters and MPs flocked to Twitter to pay tribute. The Speaker’s wife, Sally Bercow posted a number of Tweets, saying: ‘Sad to hear Brian Haw has died. ‘His peace camp in Parly Sq was a good thing (in my humble opinion-- many here would beg to differ).’ She added: ‘Hoping Westminster Council might put up a blue plaque: Brian Haw, peace campaigner, lived here 2001 - 2011.’ Haw was the son of a soldier who was one of the first to enter the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp after it was liberated from the Nazis. Haw spent time in the merchant navy and worked as a carpenter, but his evangelical Christian faith drove him to seek out suffering. He visited Northern Ireland during the Troubles and travelled to the killing fields of Cambodia. Haw also worked with troubled youngsters in Redditch, Worcestershire where he lived with his wife Kay and their seven children. Haw told journalists that he had left his family to campaign for other families suffering in war zones. ‘I want to go back to my own kids and look them in the face again, knowing that I’ve done all I can to try and save the children of Iraq and other countries who are dying because of my Government’s unjust, amoral, fear- and money-driven policies,’ he said. Anti-establishment: Mr Haw's political position often led to run-ins with the law . ‘These children and people of other countries are every bit as valuable and worthy of love as my precious wife and children.’ In his long fight against the Government, Haw became a beacon for civil rights campaigners. In April 2002 Westminster City Council began legal action to remove him under the Highways Act, but the case never came to court. The council later limited the hours he could use a megaphone to attack Government policies. In 2005 the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act restricted the right to protest in designated areas within 1km of the Houses of Parliament . But the High Court ruled that Haw could apply to the police for permission to continue his demonstration. High-profile support: Although many politicians condemned Mr Haw's tactics, he did win the backing of veteran Labour MP Tony Benn (left) This was granted - but only with a series of conditions limiting the size of his protest site. In 2006 police seized 90 per cent of Haw’s placards overnight on the grounds that he had breached these restrictions. However, a judge later found that there was no case to answer. This year the Greater London Authority successfully got permission to evict Haw from the grass area at the centre of Parliament Square. Westminster Council is due later this year to go to court to try to get the demonstrators moved off the pavement too. His protest was immortalised in January 2007 when former Turner Prize nominee Mark Wallinger recreated his camp at the Tate Britain gallery. Haw also won a Channel 4 News award for Most Inspiring Political Figure in 2007. Determined: Mr Haw pictured in the early days of his one-man campaign . Yesterday his collection of bleak war photos remained untouched. Fellow members of the Parliament Square Peace Campaign said his legal battles had taken a toll on his health. They released this statement: ‘Brian showed great determination and courage during the many long hard years he led his Peace Campaign in Parliament Square, during which it is well documented that he was relentlessly persecuted by the authorities which eventually took its toll on his health. ‘Parliament, the police, and courts etc, should forever be ashamed of their disgraceful behaviour towards Brian.’","Campaigner loses fight against lung cancer .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 10:41 AM on 19th September 2011 . An increase in child abuse, mostly in infants, is linked with the recent recession in new research that raises fresh concerns about the impact of the nation's economic woes. The results are in a study of 422 abused children from mostly lower-income families, known to face greater risks for being abused, and the research involved just 74 counties in four states. But lead author Dr Rachel Berger of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh said the results confirm anecdotal reports from many paediatricians who've seen increasing numbers of shaken baby cases and other forms of brain-injuring abuse. Study: An increase in child abuse is linked with the recession in new research that raises fresh concerns about the impact of the nation's economic woes . Dr Berger decided to study this type of injury, known as abusive head trauma, after noticing an increase at her own hospital from late 2007 through June 2009. Her hospital averaged 30 cases per year during those recession years versus 17 yearly before 2007. Author: Dr Rachel Berger of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh . Though this abuse is still uncommon, the number of cases in the counties studied increased sharply, rising from about 9 cases per 100,000 children in pre-recession years, to almost 15 per 100,000 kids during the recession — a 65 per cent increase. By contrast, juvenile diabetes — a better-known condition — affects about 19 per 100,000 children younger than age 10. Children studied were younger than five, and most were infants. Most suffered brain damage and 69 died, though the death rate didn't rise during the recession. Unemployment rates in the 74 counties rose during the five-year study. The proportion of children on Medicaid in those counties also increased, from 77 per cent before the recession to 83 per cent. However, insurance and family employment information were not reported for the abused children in the study. Combine the stress of raising a young child with wage cuts or lost jobs and you get 'a sort of toxic brew in terms of thinking about possible physical violence', said Mark Rank, a social welfare professor at Washington University in St Louis. He said the study echoes sociological research linking violence with declines in economic well-being. Along with U.S. Census data released last week indicating that a record 46 million Americans are poor, the study shows that 'as poverty goes up and economic stagnation continues...there are really human costs involved', Rank said. The study was released online Monday in Paediatrics. Results: Children studied were younger than five, and most were infants. Most suffered brain damage and 69 died . The counties studied included Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania, central and southern Ohio and a handful of counties in northern Kentucky and in the Seattle area. The researchers examined medical records and national labour statistics for 2004 through November 2007 and compared them with data from the recession. Of the 422 children diagnosed with abusive head trauma during the study, roughly 65 cases occurred each year before the recession, versus about 108 yearly during the recession. Blame: The country's economic woes are thought to be the reason for the rise in child abuse . Federal government data suggest that the recession did not affect child abuse rates. But the study authors said those numbers are based on reports from child protective services, not medical diagnoses, and did not address brain injuries specifically. The research doesn't prove that the recession caused the abuse. Studying different regions and children from more middle-class families would help clarify if the recession really played a role, said Dr Peter Sherman, director of the residency program in social paediatrics at Montefiore Medical Centre in New York. Dr Sherman noted that most children studied were publicly insured even before the recession, suggesting that their families were already struggling financially. Still, the recession affected many lower-income families, and Dr Sherman said the study highlights 'a very important issue'. Many of his patients are from poor families and abuse is not uncommon, he said, but believes paediatricians could help with prevention by asking families about difficulties paying for food or shelter and referring those in need to social service agencies. Sometimes just asking parents about stresses in their lives and acknowledging their struggles can help, he said. Most parents who abuse young children aren't 'ill-intentioned', he said. 'Most of it is kind of just snapping...maybe being sleep-deprived and just losing it. It's something that can happen to anyone. Economics is just another stress' that can increase the risks, Dr Sherman said.","Head injuries almost double in US after credit crunch .

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 4:27 PM on 21st September 2011 . Former ambassador: Chelsea Ives will also stand trial accused of attacking a rickshaw driver . A shamed former Olympic youth ambassador today admitted going looting two nights running during the London riots. Chelsea Ives, 18, pleaded guilty to a string of offences over two separate nights in Enfield and Hackney when she appeared at Wood Green Crown Court. The talented athlete and singer admitted criminal damage after she was caught on CCTV on August 7th damaging a BMW police car in Enfield. She also admitted burglary with intent to steal, after she broke into a looted T-Mobile phone store, and violent disorder while in Enfield. Her appalled mother Adrienne, who was in court, handed her in to police after she saw footage of her daughter damaging the police car on television. Ives - a former Waltham Forest Council youth Olympic ambassador - was initially remanded in custody after being charged in connection with the rioting in Enfield. But when police reviewed CCTV footage of the next night's disorder they spotted her joining in with a gang attacking a supermarket in Hackney, the court heard. She pleaded guilty to violent disorder on Lower Clapton Road, Hackney, where she and a gang of 10 others were spotted trying to force entry into a Somerfields supermarket. This CCTV image shows a pink-topped suspect identified as Ives swinging a roadworks post at a police car . At an earlier hearing the prosecution told the court how Ives had picked up a rock and thrown it in the direction of police cars travelling on Lower Clapton Road. She denied a charge of burglary with intent to steal from HMV on Church Street, Enfield, and a similar charge relating to a break-in at the Somerfield supermarket in Hackney the next night. Ives, who was wearing a short green top with her hair tied back, spoke only to confirm her name and indicate her plea to each of six charges during today's hearing. Ives' mother, Adrienne Ives, leaves Highbury Magistrates' Court last month after turning in her daughter to face riot charges . Howard Tobias, prosecuting, said the Crown would consider dropping the burglary with intent to steal charges. He said: 'It is something the Crown must consider before sentencing.' Elroy Claxton, representing Ives, asked the Probation Service to prepare a pre-sentence report. Mr Claxton told the court his client also faces a trial in relation to an unrelated incident during which a rickshaw driver was assaulted in central London. Ives, who denies the charge, is accused of assaulting rickshaw rider Uzeyir Guler in Leicester Square after she allegedly refused to pay a £20 fare. Harris, and Chantelle Ives, also 18 and from Leytonstone, East . London, are both charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and making . off without payment. They deny the assault and are due to stand . trial in the week beginning November 28. The court heard today that Ives has three previous convictions all related to an incident when she was 'riding on the railway without payment that led to an altercation.' The details of the convictions were not revealed in court. Judge Shaun Lyons said: 'She was riding on the railways and there was an incident. She was given a suspended sentence so it must have been quite serious.' Mr Claxton agreed and said it was quite a serious offence. At the time of handing her in, her mother Adrienne, 43, said: 'I have no regrets. I love my daughter, but she was brought up to know right from wrong.' Judge Shaun Lyons adjourned sentencing to a date to be set. He said the rioting matter would be dealt with at Wood Green Crown Court while the court must consider a date for sentencing in light of the trial.",Chelsea Ives also faces trial for unrelated assault of rickshaw driver .
"By . Martin Delgado . Last updated at 1:10 AM on 26th June 2011 . Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones is facing more questions over his use of taxpayers’ money at a charity he set up for young entrepreneurs. Vince Cable’s Department for Business has launched a new inquiry into claims of financial mismanagement at the National Enterprise Academy, revealed in The Mail on Sunday last week. But it can now be disclosed that four of Mr Jones’s companies have been paid more than £900,000 over the past three years to provide services to the charity, set up to teach business skills to teenagers. Family ties: Peter Jones with his long-term partner Tara Capp whose father has taken over the running of the academy . They include his telecoms giant Phones International, which made a profit of nearly £11 million in the year to April 2010, and his television production company PJ TV. These firms, along with his web media agency PJ Media and phone handset distributor Data Select, supplied the NEA with hardware, marketing services and IT support. In another development, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the academy is now being run by the father of Mr Jones’s girlfriend Tara Capp. Clive Capp, 61, has taken over as acting chief executive, although he appears to have little experience of managing a large educational institution. Companies House records show that his only current directorship is human resources director at a swimming school run by his wife Pat from their home in Maidenhead, Berkshire. The school teaches at a leisure centre in the town. Chief executive: Miss Capp's father Clive on a walking holiday . Mr Capp, whose daughter Tara has three children with Mr Jones, is also registered as a former consultant to a company called the One Stop Film Shop, which was dissolved in 2009. Mr Jones’s spokesman said Mr Capp was well qualified for the NEA post and that his family link to the tycoon enhanced his ability to do the job. The allegations of financial mismanagement were made by former civil servant Tom Bewick, who was brought in by Mr Jones to run the academy last year. Mr Bewick quit after only a week in the £138,000-a-year job because he was concerned about the way up to £9 million of public money was being spent. The NEA’s finance director says this figure is incorrect and that the actual amount of money involved is £6.5 million for a project to cover a seven-year business plan. In a letter to Mr Jones – the  contents of which were revealed by The Mail on Sunday last week – Mr Bewick claimed the NEA was failing to attract the expected number of students and was in danger of running out of money. The MoS has now learned that the NEA could lose an expected £500,000 after senior industrialists failed to reach an agreement with the Peter Jones Foundation, the tycoon’s personal charity through which funding for the NEA is channelled. The money was to have come from a body called Enterprise UK, which was set up in 2004 by business organisations, including the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors, to encourage entrepreneurship. Scandal: How the Mail On Sunday revealed the story last week . The Labour Government pumped up to £10 million into it, but the funding was switched off by the Coalition and groups were invited to bid for the remaining assets. Mr Jones claimed in March that his foundation had been selected to receive the money after he made a successful pitch, but trustees of Enterprise UK now say no final decision has been reached and that other charities could be invited to apply for the cash as early as next month. In a statement after a trustees’ meeting on Friday, British Chambers of Commerce director general David Frost said: ‘It was agreed that unless the terms and conditions of the due diligence process were agreed by the Peter Jones Foundation by the end of the month, and the exercise successfully concluded . . . by mid-July, Enterprise UK will seek expressions of interest from other charitable organisations engaged in enterprise promotion.’ An NEA source, however, gave a different . explanation for the delay. He said it had been caused by the trustees’ insistence that the Peter Jones Foundation should take over full legal . liability for Enterprise UK and all its remaining assets, while Mr Jones . wanted liability to be capped at £500,000. Mr Jones said last night: . ‘We hope all outstanding issues will be resolved next week.’ Whistle blower: Mr Jones with former civil servant Tom Bewick, whose claims of financial mismanagement were revealed last week . Meanwhile, the Department for Business has launched a new inquiry into Mr Bewick’s allegations, after initially insisting that an investigation by the Skills Funding Agency had found no evidence to substantiate his claims. It is understood that Mr Bewick, who was not asked to give evidence to the initial inquiry, will now be contacted by Mr Cable’s officials. A spokesman for Mr Jones said PJ Media, PJ TV, Phones International and Data Select had provided services to the NEA on favourable terms during its start-up period. He added: ‘The remaining companies . [in his portfolio] have donated their time free of charge and without . charging for supplies and/or overheads in support of the NEA. ‘Clive . Capp has more than 40 years’ experience in business, specifically in . the areas of technology, human resources and recruitment. His . contribution to the NEA has been extremely valuable. Business: Mr Jones, back right, on the hit show Dragons Den with the other judges on the panel . ‘Clive’s connection to Peter [through his daughter] adds an extra level of attention when it comes to supporting Peter Jones’s mission to greatly improve access to vital business skills for young people.’ Mr Bewick claims the Peter Jones Foundation has only £270,000 left in the bank and is spending at an average rate of £230,000 a month. But finance director Julian Cabrera said: ‘The bank balance changes monthly. It is correct that the Skills Funding Agency contract and funding has now [been] completed but the Peter Jones Foundation does not have cashflow issues. ‘It is well run and the audit of this year’s accounts will shortly confirm that the foundation is a going concern for a minimum of 12 months.’",Peter Jones faces fresh probe into academy now run by girlfriend’s father .
"By . Laurie Whitwell . Last updated at 6:42 PM on 7th September 2011 . Dangerous jump: Anna Beninati, 17, a freshman at Colorado State University, severed her legs while trying to hop a train back to Fort Collins . The tape of the 911 call which captures the chaotic moments after a 17-year-old college student severed her legs at the knees while attempting to jump aboard a moving train was released today. In the recording a female paramedic, who had been driving past the scene before stopping and calling for help, can be heard screaming repeatedly: 'Do not move her!' Anna Beninati, a Colorado State University freshman majoring in music, was 'train hopping' with three males between the ages of 17 and 21 when she slipped and fell beneath the steel wheels of a freight train in Longmont, just north of Denver. The northbound Burlington Northern Santa Fe train severed one of Miss Beninati's legs mid-thigh and the other just below the knee, at around 1:35pm on Monday. The train, which was hauling 118 empty coal cars, was travelling about 10mph, police said. In the 911 tape, the emergency caller, who identified herself as an EMT, can be heard saying: 'Oh my God.' She tells the dispatcher: 'I am on Third . Avenue at the railroad tracks. Somebody just tried to jump on the train . and severed her legs.' 'Do not move her! Don't move her!' she shouts at five people trying to help. 'There were four individuals trying to jump onto the train,' she says. 'One succeeded, the other fell and she severed her legs. Holy s***.' Scroll down for video . Horrific: Two men embrace each other after a woman they were travelling with was struck by the moving train in Longmont, Colorado today - one, appearing to have blood on his pants . Tragic: The 17-year-old girl slipped on the northbound Burlington Northern Santa Fe train around 1:35pm . The dispatcher tells the caller not to tourniquet the girl's wounds and that an ambulance is on its way. 'Don't sit her up, you guys!' the EMT tells others. 'They are trying to sit her up.' 'Lay your head back, honey,' she tells the Miss Beninati. A second paramedic, who works with . the first paramedic at Longmont United Hospital, arrives to help, . putting on surgical gloves and applying femoral pressure with a t-shirt to stem the bleeding. 'She is very, very, very pale,' the first EMT says. 'She is alert. She is talking. Now she is crying.' The dispatcher asks: 'What part of her leg was amputated? At the ankle? At the knee?' She replies: 'Left side is amputated right below the hip.' Miss Beninati hears this and begins to sob uncontrollably. 'Oh, I am sorry, I am sorry,' the EMT tells her. 'I shouldn't have said that right in her ear. Dammit.' On the tracks: Police investigate after the incident, in which one other person sustained minor injuries . Moving: Authorities said the 100-car train was travelling at 18mph when the incident occurred near the intersection of 3rd Avenue and Atwood Street . 'The other one, right leg, it looks like (it's severed) right below the knee,' she tells the dispatcher. The dispatcher then tries to get the . EMT to collect the severed legs but as they are under the train and it . is still moving they decide it is too dangerous. Instead the EMTs are instructed to continue to add pressure to wound to stop the bleeding. The nurse who made the 911 call was too traumatised about what happened to talk publicly, 7NEWS reported. However, the other EMT, Kathy Poiry, . told the station that she was just focused on keeping pressure on the . girl's legs. She said she knew that if more blood was lost, the girl . would die. Miss Beninati was . transported to Longmont United Hospital and then airlifted to Denver . Health Medical Center, where her legs where amputated. Her parents yesterday released a statement which thanked bystanders who went to aid their daughter at the scene. Longmont police say Miss Beninati was . trying to hop the train to get back to Fort Collins after she and three . male friends had travelled to Denver, 30miles south. A 21-year-old Broomfield man and a . 17-year-old Fort Collins boy successfully got on the train before the . girl tried and fell beneath the wheels, police said yesterday. The 17-year-old boy jumped from the train, scraping his arm. Another friend, Charlie Hamilton, 25, of Gillette, Wyoming, helped pull Miss Beninati out from under train, police said. Mr Hamilton and the Fort Collins boy . were cited for trespassing, police say. The Broomfield man left the . scene and police have not been able to locate him. Police say they do not suspect alcohol or drug use in the accident. Miss Beninati had recently graduated from Alta High School in Sandy, Utah. 'She was really involved in art and music,' former Alta classmate Mitch Dom told ABC4. Mr . Dom told the station that Miss Beninati was very artistic and went by . the nickname 'Rush' because she said she always finished projects in a . hurry. Online commentators were unsurprised by the attempt to hop on board a moving train. 'Allen E' said on the Denver Post forum: 'When I was an undergraduate @ CSU we would hitch hike between Fort Collins and Boulder on Friday to spend the weekend at Tulagi's. 'Cheap pitchers, good music. Free ride down, and free ride back. 'I have to think the kids were returning to Fort Collins the undergraduate way - free. 'To the young woman who suffered the loss, our prayers and thoughts are with you. 'No condemnation from me. 'I might have done the same thing if I knew the trains were headed for Boulder in those days.' Longmont police commander Jeff Satur said the incident was a 'terrible' example of the danger of trying to hop a train. He said: 'It's terrible. 'It really highlights the dangers of trying to hop a train. It is not safe by any means.' A police investigation is ongoing.

"By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 12:07 PM on 20th September 2011 . Martin Thompson, 29, had been the Haskins' gardener for about five years, and had earned their trust . A conman has been jailed for fleecing an elderly couple out of their £50,000 life savings - by posing as their grandson. Gardener Martin Thompson, 29, left Bertie and Marion Haskins penniless after plundering cash from three of their bank accounts, Bristol Crown Court heard. After befriending the pair he persuaded them to let him sign their cheques - telling the banks he was their grandson - and spent their life savings on a string of holidays. Devastated Marion was admitted to hospital with stress over the scam and contracted a superbug which killed her on May 7 this year. The court heard that her blind husband, who suffers from severe arthritis, now finds it hard to trust anyone. Jailing Thompson for three and a half years, Judge Michael Longman condemned his 'greed and wicked behaviour'. He said: 'Over a period of time, you unscrupulously fleeced them of their savings for your own personal enrichment.' Thompson, from Longwell Green, near Bristol, admitted three counts of theft between May 23, 2009, and January 31 this year. The court heard he had taken £23,400 from the couple's Britannia account, £18,851.40 from their Post Office account and £6,250 from their Santander account. John Penny, prosecuting, said Thompson had been a gardener for the couple at their maisonette in Cadbury Heath, Bristol, for about five years. He built up so much trust that he persuaded Mrs Haskins to make him a signatory on the couple's Post Office bank account. This gave him access to their pensions and the account from which bills and rent came out by direct debit. He regularly withdrew money for them from that account and, unbeknown to the couple, he become a joint account holder for other accounts with Santander and Britannia. By posing as their grandson, he began making withdrawals for himself - gradually depleting their life savings. The 29-year-old was sentenced to three and a half years in jail at Bristol Crown Court . Eventually their direct debits, which for years had been paid on time and without a hitch, started being rejected by the banks. Suspicions were raised by a neighbour of the couple, who noticed an overdue utility bill. She spoke to their niece Bridget Lyons, who contacted Thompson and later called the police. When he was arrested in February this year, Thompson maintained he had been given permission to withdraw money for Mr and Mrs Haskins. But when police interviewed the couple it emerged they had no idea he had been taking so much money from the account and had become a joint account holder. Speaking after Thompson was sentenced, Detective Constable Pete Walker, of Avon and Somerset Police, said that the Haskins had lived in the same home for 50 years and were considered 'perfect tenants' before the fraud. He said: 'This is a despicable crime in which Martin Thompson took advantage of a vulnerable couple - and their age - having gained their trust over a number of years.' As the money stolen was as a result of 'legitimate' withdrawals, the banks have not paid the Haskins back any of the money. A Proceeds of Crime Act application has been lodged in a bid to recoup some of the money from Thompson.","Marion Haskins admitted to hospital due to stress over the scam - and she died of a superbug this year .

But these famous faces have something in common beyond their star quality. They . are all professional lookalikes – and caused a few raised eyebrows when . they gathered in the unlikely setting of an Indian restaurant in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire. Diners . at the Apne restaurant were stunned to see BRITNEY SPEARS (7) feeding . SIMON COWELL (10) onion bhajis - before whacking him when he pinched one . too many. Cowell’s double Andrew Monk, 52, was once chosen by the music . mogul as his favourite lookalike, while Spears impersonator Michaela . Weeks, 27, has received recognition on the singer’s website. I'm a lookalike, get me out of here: Fourteen doppelgangers at a get-together in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire for those who impersonate celebrities . FROM LEFT: ROY ‘CHUBBY’ BROWN (1), ELTON JOHN (2), PAT BUTCHER (3), MR BEAN (4), MACKENZIE CROOK (5), RICKY GERVAIS (6), BRITNEY SPEARS (7), JIM ROYLE (8), MICHELLE OBAMA (9), SIMON COWELL (10), JENSON BUTTON (11), LUCIANO PAVAROTTI (12), DAVID BECKHAM (13), SIR CLIFF RICHARD (14) The pair were joined by LUCIANO PAVAROTTI (12), or 60-year-old Colin Miller, who earns up to £1,000 a week as the late Italian opera singer, and Paul Williams, 38, who performs as comedian ROY ‘CHUBBY’ BROWN (1). ELTON JOHN (2) is better known as Nigel Merritt, 44, but has become so popular as a lookalike that he is even releasing an album of his own. Rita Davis, 62, is the spitting image of former EastEnders character PAT BUTCHER (3), while Steve Keefe, 47, has appeared in anything from health and safety videos to charity events as MR BEAN (4). Taking a break from The Office are Brett Sirrell, 40, who impersonates actor MACKENZIE CROOK (5), and Tim Oliver, 47, as RICKY GERVAIS (6). There’s also SIR CLIFF RICHARD (14) in the form of Will Chandler, 49, who says he has been complimented on his act by the singer himself, and DAVID BECKHAM (13) played by Andy Harmer, 32, who has made a full-time career out of his similarity to the footballer and stood in for him in adverts. MICHELLE OBAMA (9) is better known as Dionne Rose, 46, and Formula 1 driver JENSON BUTTON (11) goes by the name of Nick Lancaster, 29. Don Leith, 74, is regularly approached for autographs by fans who think he plays JIM ROYLE (8) in the Royle Family. Don't hit me, baby: The Britney Spears lookalike swings at 'Simon Cowell' at a dinner for the best celebrity doppelgangers in Britain . Customers at the restaurant became even more confused when a spat broke out between pop princess Spears and music mogul Cowell. One said: 'I . couldn't believe what I was seeing when I saw Britney and Simon Cowell . having dinner together.' 'It looked friendly at first and even . quite intimate with them feeding each other onion bhajis but suddenly . he said something and she stood up and slapped him one. 'It was astonishing and everyone in the restaurant gasped until they both started laughing and explained they were lookalikes. 'It . was hilarious but they really did have everyone fooled.

David Beckham is joined at dinner by David Brent and Gareth from hit comedy The Office - or so it would appear . The group, led by the Pavarotti doppleganger Colin Miller, 60, will compete in the global lookalike contest 'Reel Awards' in Las Vegas on February 21 next year. Colin, who earns up to £1,000 a week for appearing as the late opera singer, said: 'We are all looking to fly out to Las Vegas to take part in an annual convention for look-a-likes.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:57 AM on 13th August 2011 . New details have emerged in the trial of Rutgers student Dharun Ravi, who is accused of bullying and intimidating his gay roommate to a point that he committed suicide. Among the new evidence are details of the 25-year-old man what Tyler Clementi was videoed kissing bare chested in his dorm room. Tyler is said to have mulled over bringing him to a hotel but did not want to spend $35 so brought him back to his dorm instead, despite fears Ravi might walk in on them. Charged: Dharun Ravi, right, didn't bully his room mate Tyler Clementi before his suicide, according to defence lawyers . It was also revealed that Tyler's . mother 'all but disowned him' when he came out to his parents a short . time before he left for Rutgers University. The court was also told that Ravi . tried to apologise to his roommate after the alleged incident, texting . him saying: 'I’ve known you were gay and I have no . problem with it. 'I don’t want your freshman year to be . ruined because of a petty misunderstanding, it’s adding to my guilt.' But the shy violinist from Ridgewood had likely already killed himself by the time they were sent. The text messages, instant messages and other documents emerged during the trial this week. Regarding being caught by Ravi in his . dorm with the man, Tyler said in an instant message with a friend: . 'That would be so awk tho lol ... him walking in.' Although Ravi, from Plainsboro, New . Jersey, didn't walk in, he was allegedly using a webcam to watch the . encounter from a different room and Tweeting about it. Suicide: Tyler Clementi leaped off a bridge after discovering he had been filmed in a tryst with another man . A few days later, on September 22, . Tyler, then 18, jumped off the George Washington Bridge in a suicide . that made national headlines. Talking about coming out to his . parents, in another instant message with a friend, he said: 'It’s a good . thing dad is ok w/it or I would be in serious trouble/ mom has . basically completely rejected me.' According to the Star Ledger, details . of the growing tension between the roomates over his sexuality were . revealed today in hundreds of pages of documents released in a court . filing by Ravi’s attorney. Ravi is charged with 15 counts . including invasion of privacy and bias intimidation for targeting Tyler . because of his sexual orientation. His attorney has asked Superior Court Judge Glenn Berman to dismiss all charges against him. If convicted on the most serious charges, Ravi - who is now 19 - could face up to ten years in prison. According to the Star Ledger, the . court also heard that the 19-year-old used his computer skills to deduce . his new roommate was gay as soon as Rutgers sent him his name. He used Tyler’s e-mail address to learn he had frequented web pages for gay men. Grieving: Tyler told his friend about coming out to his parents, Joe and Molly Clementi, saying his mum had rejected him . On an August 22 computer chat with a friend, he wrote: 'Most gay person I’ve ever seen.' After they moved in together, the . pair spent time in their room chatting on their computers with friends . about their tense living arrangements. Cooperating: Molly Wei, who was also implicated in bullying Clementi, has agreed to testify against Dharun Ravi . Tyler claimed Ravi would not change . his clothes in front of him, writing in an instant message: 'He knows . I’m gay and wow he changes his pants inside of his closet ... it’s the . most awk thing you’ve ever seen.' He also told a friend two days before . he committed suicide that he was not too bothered when he first learned . that Ravi had watched him on the webcam with the 25-year-old man. He wrote: 'When I first read the tweet I defs felt . violated/ But then/ When I remembered what actually happened ... / Idk . (I don’t know) ... /Doesn’t seem soooo bad lol.' But he later reported the incident to . Rutgers officials and requested a new room after learning that Ravi . tried to turn on the webcam a second time and sent a Twitter message out . telling people to watch. Ravi also allegedly used other . students' computers to check the angle of the webcam, according to . investigators' testimony to the grand jury. One student living in the dorm said Ravi wanted the webcam pointed at Tyler's bed. Another female student said Ravi used her computer to check the camera was operational.","Text messages, instant messages and other documents emerge in court .

"By . Rose Parker . Last updated at 6:10 PM on 20th September 2011 . Assassinated: Burhanuddin Rabbani was killed by a suicide bomber . A former Afghan president was today assassinated by a suicide bomber who had concealed explosives in his turban. Burhanuddin Rabbani had been heading a government peace council set up to build contacts with the Taliban. Four of his bodyguards also died and a key presidential adviser was wounded. President Hamid Karzai cut short a visit to the U.S. over the attack, which dealt a harsh blow to peace efforts after a decade of war. The turban bomber entered Rabbani's . house in the capital Kabul on Tuesday evening and blew himself up . inside, Mohammad Zahir, the chief of criminal investigation for the . Kabul police. Rabbani . headed the country's High Peace Council, which was set up by the Afghan . government to work toward a political solution to the decade-long war. However, it had made little headway since it was formed a year ago. Rabbani . was president of the Afghan government that preceded the Taliban rule. After he was driven from Kabul in 1996, he became the nominal head of . the Northern Alliance, mostly minority Tajiks and Uzbeks, who swept to . power in Kabul after the Taliban's fall. Rabbani is an ethnic Tajik. His . killing dampens hopes of starting peace negotiations with Taliban . insurgents and also will hamper efforts to keep regional and ethnic . rivalries, which feed the insurgency, in check. As . one of the wise old man of Afghan politics and the leader of the . anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, Rabanni's role in the attempts to reach . out to the Taliban and seeking a political deal with them - with the . U.S. blessing - will be hard to replicate in the near future. His . death could unleash a well of resentment building up among some senior . Northern Alliance members, who accuse President Hamid Karzai of . colluding with the Taliban. Guard: Afghan policemen secure the alley leading to Mr Rabbani's house after the former president was killed earlier today . Already . Afghanistan's ethnic minorities have begun to re-arm in the face of . negotiations with the Taliban. Rabbani's death is likely to accelerate . the re-arming and lay the foundation for a bitter civil war once U.S. troops leave the country in 2014. Karzai's adviser Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai was wounded in the attack. A relative who answered Stanekzai's phone said that the wounds did not appear to be life-threatening, but Stanekzai was in the hospital. The relative declined to give his name because of the sensitivity of the situation . Stanekzai is chief executive of the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Program, a highly touted program funded by the U.S. and its coalition allies to bring mid- and lower-level Taliban back into Afghan society. The programme has so far only managed to reintegrated about 2,000 of the estimated 25,000-40,000 insurgents in Afghanistan. Reintegration was the other half of reconciliation, which is aims to try and broker a peace deal with the senior Taliban leadership.

"By . Fiona Roberts . Last updated at 2:06 PM on 28th July 2011 . Inexplicable: Friends and family say Celina Cass is the last person they would expect to run away . Police are desperately searching for an 11-year-old girl who disappeared from her bedroom three days ago. Celina Cass was last seen playing on her computer at about 9pm on Monday. When her parents went to wake her up the next morning, she had vanished. Her disappearance has shaken the small town of Stewartstown, New Hampshire, just a mile from the Canadian border, as police crews search the Connecticut River for any sign of the little girl. There was no indication Celina had run away or was kidnapped, and there were no signs of a struggle. Her . stepfather, Wendell Noyers, described the fifth-grader as a quiet girl . who would never have left home by herself. He declined to comment . further, saying 'I'm not really at liberty to say anything.' The FBI have now sent a specialist abduction team to join the search, but officials say they are still not treating her disappearance as suspicious and have not issued an Amber Alert. There was a flurry of activity yesterday at the house she shares with her mother, stepfather and sister. Her father is said to be seriously ill in hospital. Agents are believed to be trawling through Celina's phone and computer records. But officials remain tight-lipped about their investigation. Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said it is still being treated as a missing persons case, and added: 'We are still desperately looking for her.' Yesterday an extensive land search was scaled back, and police trawled the Connecticut River using two boats. Devastated: New Hampshire State Police officers watch as a woman identified as Celina Cass's mother, under a blanket, is escorted from the family home in Stewartstown, New Hampshire . They lowered the waterway . so helicopters could scour it from the air, while officers desperately . searching an area within a half-mile radius of her home. Frantic search: Celina Cass vanished from her home in the small town of Stewartstown, New Hampshire . Around 80 friends and neighbours held a second vigil for Celina last night as they desperately prayed for her safe return. They gathered around a framed photograph of the schoolgirl on a picnic table, surrounded by candles. They said Celina was the last person they'd expect to run away. Fighting back tears and holding a lit . candle at the gathering last night, family friend Rebecca Goodrum said: . 'She never went anywhere without her mom or sister.' She said: 'She was beautiful. She was the light of everything.' Another, Kayla Baglio, said: 'She is . very shy. If she doesn't know you, she'd look at her sister to see if it . was OK to talk to you. One of Celina's schoolfriends, . 11-year-old Makayla Riendeau, said she was very athletic and a stickler . about getting her school work done on time. She said: 'She's a very good friend, and she never lets anybody down. Shannon Towles, who owns a mini-mart on Route 3, said her disappearance had shaken the town, which has just 800 residents. She said: 'It's creepy. Things like this don't happen here. I know that's kind of a tired phrase. I'm an overprotective mom as it is. Now it's going to be way worse.' Call for help: Family friends hold up missing posters for Celina for passing cars to view outside the family home . Hunt: A New Hampshire Fish and Game officer uses as GPS device as he searches for Celina along a road near her home in Stewartstown. An FBI abduction team has now joined the investigation . Mrs Towles said Celina wasn't the type . of girl to hitchhike or run away. She said: 'She's just a little girl . and she's a nice little girl.' Celina attends Stewartstown Community School, where she is one of just 85 pupils. The . district superintendent described her as popular and well-liked, and . said six counsellors were on hand to help students cope with her . disappearance. Comforting: Family and friends of Celina wait on the porch of the family home . Mrs Towles said her daughter, Echo, . had asked her whether she thought Celina was still alive. She said: 'How . do I answer that question? And do I want to? I don't want to think . about it, but I pray every second that she is.' Friends . and neighbours have spent the last two days posting flyers showing her . smiling face on every available lamppost and tree trunk. Popular: Celia Cass pictured left in her basketball uniform and right, with friends in a photo she posted on Facebook. Her friends have described her as athletic and hardworking, and say she would never run away . Hunt: Residents post flyers on trees in Stewartstown to help find Celina Cass, who disappeared from her home on Monday evening . Yesterday police searched the woods . behind an apartment building about a mile north of the town. They . carried bags and boxes, but it was unclear if they collected anything. Later . officers went into Celina's home, then stretched yellow crime scene . tape around it before posting a uniformed officer outside. Then . plain clothes police officers wearing purple rubber gloves surrounded a . red pick-up truck parked across the street from the house, taking . photographs and looking inside. Shaken: Celina is one of just 85 pupils at the town's school. Counsellors are on hand to help students cope with her disappearance . Lieutenant Douglas Gralenski, a state . Fish and Game Department official helping to search the river, said: . 'Honestly, we don't know where else we can look. There's so much that's . unknown.' He said: 'It's not a deep river. You'd be hard-pressed to find six to eight feet in . most of it in that area. When we had it drawn down, it was . exceptionally low.'

"By . Jacqui Goddard . Last updated at 10:37 PM on 14th July 2011 . A mother, whose two-year-old daughter died after her pet Burmese python strangled and tried to eat her, was found guilty of third-degree murder on Thursday. Jaren Hare, 21, now faces up to 35 . years in prison after a jury in Florida took two hours to also find her . and boyfriend Charles Darnell, 34, guilty of manslaughter and child . neglect charges. Defence . lawyer Rhiannon Arnold told the court in Bushnell that she has had to . live with the horror 'like a dagger across her soul' for two years. Convicted: Jaren Hare and Charles Darnell also faced child neglect charges . Hare, she said, never believed that her . 'gentle' 8ft 6in pet, named Gypsy, could be capable of killing a child . and was distraught when her daughter Shaianna was found dead in her cot . in July 2009 with the snake coiled tightly around her neck. The starving . snake had been trying to eat her, according to a deputy chief medical examiner, Wendy Lavezzi. 'There were also several clusters of . puncture wounds that represent bites from the snake as the snake was . trying to ingest her, basically,' Lavezzi told the jury while they . viewed the grim post-mortem photos of the child. Prosecutor Pete Magrino said in closing arguments that Hare and her boyfriend were completely at fault. The tragedy was, he said: 'Needless, senseless, careless and reckless and the responsibility for Shaianna Hare’s death lies with those two defendants.' He showed the jury two pictures of the girl, one of her smiling happily and another of her after the post-mortem, which found she had been bitten by the albino snake and died of asphyxiation. Gypsy, he said, escaped from a tank over which the defendants had placed only a quilt as a makeshift lid. Hare burst into tears as the verdicts were read, while Darnell showed no emotion other than to place his arm around her. Both had rejected a pre-trial deal that could have seen them jailed for up to 10 years. Huge beast: Investigators take the 8ft 6in python from the property where it killed two-year-old Shaianna Hare . In her own closing arguments, Miss Arnold told the six-member jury that Hare was never anything but a 'loving mother' to the toddler and insisted the girl’s death was just an accident. Ismail Solis, another lawyer on the defence team, added: 'That event will shadow her for the rest of her life. 'But there’s not a scintilla of evidence that Jaren Ashley Hare was ever a bad mother. 'We’re talking about Gypsy, a pet that turned killer. Did she look at this and say ""Gee, is this potentially a killer animal that’s going to kill us all?"" No, that was not her mindset.' But assistant state attorney Magrino said that the couple should have known that keeping a deadly snake in a tank at their home in Oxford, Florida, starving hungry and without a secure lid to keep it inside, posed a danger. The python had escaped several times before and had not been fed for a month. He also showed the court a photograph from 2005 when rangers in Florida’s Everglades National Park found a 13ft Burmese python dead after swallowing a six-foot alligator. He said: 'It doesn’t take a rocket scientist. If that kind of snake will take down an alligator, it will eat something else – even a small two-year-old girl.' He added: 'The death of Shaianna Hare was totally preventable. 'The snake’s not at fault in this case, folks, it’s a wild animal.' But the defendants’ lawyers said that Shaianna’s death was just an awful accident, that had left them devastated. Miss Arnold said: 'Charles Darnell and Jaren Hare never in their wildest dreams ever thought this would happen. 'They had no idea that their tame pet would suddenly go wild.' Darnell, she said, was 'guilty of making a stupid decision and having a stupid pet. He’s guilty of not being a dog lover, and liking snakes.' A sentencing hearing will be held at a later date.","Jaren Hare could face 35 years in prison .

"Marriage was torn apart by bitter rows and 'physical fights' Taylor in dispute with Russell's parents over his final resting place . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:57 PM on 18th August 2011 . Taylor Armstrong had to undergo re-constructive surgery on her face after being beaten up by her estranged husband Russell just two months before he committed suicide, it has been claimed. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star is pictured here, apparently four days before the 47-year-old businessman was found dead, sporting a cut above her left eye. Friends close to the star claim she sustained this injury 'playing football' - and that Russell, who hanged himself, was not behind it. Injured: Taylor Armstrong pictured four days before estranged husband Russell committed suicide with a cut above her left eye . However RadarOnline reports the . 40-year-old housewive was rushed to hospital in June following a violent . fight with Russell, who she filed for divorce from last month. A source told the website: 'The damage to her face was so extensive that she spent days in the . hospital and had to have a plastic surgeon give her re-constructive . surgery to repair what Russell did to her.' Taylor, who does charity work on behalf of domestic violence, has spoken out before about growing up in a violent family. Troubled: Friends claim this wound was inflicted during a football game, but new reports claim she was hospitalised in June after Russell assaulted her . According to the insider, she wore . heavy make-up to cover the extent of her injury and ensured their . five-year-old daughter didn't find out Russell had allegedly hit her. But her fellow housewives were said to . be aware of the incident and producers of the Bravo show had to 'film . around her' for a while. In an interview last month, Taylor . claimed she had been verbally and physically abused by her estranged . husband Russell during their six year marriage. Taylor . filed for divorce, alleging in an interview with People . magazine that she and Russell, often had 'explosive arguments' in which . he would 'curse and call her names.' The magazine reported that there were . times the 'arguments escalated into physical violence, which included . grabbing her, throwing objects, shoving her and pulling her hair.' Going . ahead? Bravo executives are deciding whether season two of The Real . Housewives of Beverly Hills will air next month, pictured here earlier . this month . Determined: Taylor has taken charge of planning Russell's memorial service, but is in dispute with his parents over his final resting place, it is claimed . Russell also acknowledged problems when questioned by the magazine. 'Did I push her? Yes, maybe things . happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our . lives that was not characteristic of who we were,' he said. 'This show . has literally pushed us to the limit.' The news comes amid reports that Russell's parents are said to be locked in a bitter dispute with Taylor about where he will be laid to rest. The reality star, . who is understood to be making the arrangements for next week's . funeral, wants him to be buried in a cemetery in the Los Angles area. Estranged: Despite being embroiled in a bitter divorce before Russell's suicide, the reality star is making preparations for the service . However . the businessman's lawyer, Ron Richards, says the parents want their . son's body to be returned to their homeland of Texas for a cremation. Taylor had been back in touch with 47-year-old Russell shortly before his death, despite having filed for divorce. But Mr Richards says he believes it was his former client's final wish was to be cremated. U.S. TV . network Bravo, which makes the Real Housewives reality show, reportedly held crisis talks yesterday. According to RadarOnline, executives spoke to Taylor's castmates at fellow star Adrienne Maloof's Beverly Hills mansion. The show has been thrown into . disarray, with a question mark over what footage to show of Taylor . working through their marriage troubles - which was all captured on . camera. Fatherless: Russell is survived by his daughter Kennedy, who is sure to be devastated at the news . A source revealed: 'The people at . Bravo just want to do the appropriate thing. Their first priority is . being respectful to Russell, Taylor . and their families.' The website reports that producers asked the housewives not to talk to the Press about Russell, who was found dead on Monday. The network is even considering . pulling the plug on the second series, which is due to on September 5, . according to The New York Daily News. A promo was released last month for the upcoming season, featuring Taylor, . Camille Grammer, Kyle and Kim Richards, Lisa Vanderpump and Adrienne . Maloof. In the preview, Taylor was shown crying over the demise of her marriage to . Russell, with whom she has a five-year-old daughter, Kennedy. It has now been confirmed by the LA County Coroner that the cause of death was suicide by hanging. His body was found on Monday at a house in Mulholland Drive. A friend of the couple, Russ . McCullough, told TMZ yesterday about Russell's desperate last days and . how he had 'begged' him for a bottle of Xanax very shortly before he . took his own life. McCullough, . who appeared in episodes of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, . alleges that he gave one pill to his friend after a particularly . downcast dinner in which Russell could not afford to pay his bill. Plush: The house on Mulholland Drive, Los Angeles where Russell Armstrong was found hanged . According to McCullough, Russell was . 'distraught' over his portrayal on the reality series and said 'this is . as bad as it gets,' he told TMZ. McCullough refused to provide the bottle of Xanax as he feared his friends may abuse the drug, the website claims. Russell, who was aged 47 at the time of his death, has a record of domestic trouble. Back in 1998, he received a conviction for battery in a domestic abuse case involving his then wife, Barbara Armstrong, according to Entertainment Tonight. Barbara was granted a protective order . against Russell and he was required to attend a one-year anger . management program, as well as weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings as . part of his sentence. Meanwhile, it has been alleged today that secrets about Russell's sexuality were about to be revealed, Radar reports. According to sources close to the businessman he was bisexual and worried that a tell-all book was going to out him. An . insider alleges to Radar: 'About six months ago Taylor confided in a . close friend that she'd found history for a gay website called . Adam4Adam.com on Russell's laptop. Action: Russell's family are said to be considering suing Bravo, who air the Real Housewives franchise . He was also spending a lot of time at . the gym, but his body wasn't changing, which she claims led her to . believe he was meeting with men he'd met off the website and not . spending time working out as he claimed,' the source added. The insider said the book went into 'great detail' about Russell's bedroom preferences. 'Not only was it going to come out . that Russell was bisexual, but there were people on the record that were . going to talk about the kind of sex he liked,' the source alleged to . Radar. 'He was into S&M type stuff; choking, and slapping.' Ed Winter of the L.A Coroner’s Office said: 'He hung himself with no suicide note found.' No drugs or alcohol were found in the bedroom where Russell died and he was fully clothed when his body was discovered. Russell is survived by five-year-old .

"By . Jaya Narain . Created 3:44 PM on 22nd September 2011 . Christian GP Dr Richard Scott outside the General Medical Council (GMC) hearing in Manchester . A doctor accused of ‘inappropriately’ discussing his devout Christian faith during a consultation with a patient yesterday launched a legal battle to avoid being sanctioned.Dr Richard Scott, 51, appeared before a disciplinary hearing after allegedly talking to the patient about Jesus in a way the General Medical Council described as ‘insensitive, exploitative and inappropriate’.The GMC heard Dr Scott had ‘crossed the line’ by allegedly suggesting the  ‘suicidal and vulnerable’ patient could  be helped by Christianity rather than  his own faith. The married GP is one of six Christian partners at a medical centre which states on its website that spiritual matters are likely to be discussed with patients during consultations. But yesterday Dr Scott, who was educated at Cambridge, began a fight to clear his name after the mother of one of his patients complained he had tried to foist his faith on her son. Dr Scott refused to accept a formal warning, instead choosing to go to a full hearing. He claims he acted professionally and within the GMC guidelines. The incident allegedly happened in August 2010, when the 24-year-old patient visited him at the Bethesda Medical Centre in Margate, Kent. Dr Scott, who used to be a medical missionary in Tanzania and India, says he gave the patient a full medical consultation, but felt he needed help to get out of a rut. So at the end of the appointment, he began talking about his own Christian belief, saying it could give him ‘comfort and strength’. But afterwards, the 24-year-old told his mother ‘he just said I need Jesus’, prompting her to file a complaint. Paul Ozin, counsel for the GMC, said: ‘A line was crossed because Dr Scott expressed his personal religious belief to a person who he knew was a vulnerable patient in a way that was plainly liable to cause the patient distress. The patient, who was seen by the GP at the Bethesda Medical Centre in Margate, Kent, pictured, felt Dr Scott had 'belittled' his own faith, the GMC heard . ‘He suggested Jesus or Christianity – his own religion – offered something exclusive and superior to that offered by the patient’s own religion.’ The professional body placed an official warning on Dr Scott’s file as a ‘compromise’. But the GP, a doctor for 28 years, is calling on the GMC to strike out the complaint  because it was made by the patient’s mother. Dr Scott claims she is not qualified to comment on what treatment a medical practitioner should prescribe her son. Yesterday the hearing was told that the unnamed patient had been asked to attend the medical tribunal to testify against the GP, but he had not turned up because he was suffering from anxiety. Lawyers are now arguing whether the panel can accept his written statement. Mr Ozin says it would be ‘unfair’ to call the witness when he is ‘ill’, but Dr Scott’s lawyer said he cannot defend himself properly if the man does not attend. In an interview last May Dr Scott, a lay preacher, said: ‘I only discussed mutual faith after obtaining the patient’s permission. ‘In our conversation, I said that personally, I had found having faith in Jesus helped me and could help the patient. At no time did the patient indicate that they were offended, or that they wanted to stop the discussion. If that had been the case, I would have immediately ended the conversation.’ Dr Scott, whose wife Heather, 50, is also a doctor, said: ‘By appealing against the decision, it will go to a public hearing. But it is worth the risk as I wanted to do this because there is a bigger picture. ‘I wanted to give confidence and inspiration to other Christians who work in the medical profession.’ The case continues.",GP is alleged to have told him faith in Christianity may help him overcome personal problems .

It is understood a small amount of the tainted milk was consumed by a patient after a member of staff gave them it, although they were unharmed by it. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said officers were alerted by staff on Saturday to new allegations of tampering at the hospital. Stepping Hill NHS Hospital in Stockport, Greater Manchester. Officers were alerted by staff on Saturday to new allegations of tampering at the hospital . Their investigation comes as officers seek to find out who is behind the tampering of saline drips, which resulted in three patients dying and affecting up to 40 others. Victims  Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Alfred Derek Weaver, 83, had unlawfully been given insulin. But the hospital tried to reassure . patients and their families that there was nothing to suggest the two . alarming incidents are related. A spokesman for Stepping Hill Hospital . said: 'We can confirm that an incident relating to the possible . contamination of a small quantity of milk took place. 'The police have been informed and the hospital is helping them with their inquiries. 'There was no lasting effect for the one patient who tasted a very small amount.' A GMP spokesman said: 'GMP are now investigating this incident but there is nothing at this stage to suggest this is in any way linked to the wider police inquiry currently ongoing at the hospital. The deaths of (from left) Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Alfred Derek Weaver, 83, at Stepping Hill Hospital are still under investigation . 'Stepping Hill is made up of a large community of people and it is unlikely that every incident reported is connected to the concerted and deliberate criminality already being investigated.' Detectives investigating the tampering of saline solution at the hospital said today that four additional deaths referred to them have been ruled out of their inquiries. They revealed that the cases were passed on to them by the coroner when it was announced that all charges in connection with the inquiry had been dropped against nurse Rebecca Leighton. However, police - who have described the investigation as something out of Murder On The Orient Express - said they are continuing to look at the suspicious deaths of the trio. Nurse Rebecca Leighton was initially arrested as part of the investigation but has since been cleared of all charges . A spokesman for GMP said: 'We can confirm that the deaths of Arnold Lancaster, Tracey Arden and Alfred Derek Weaver have undergone this same process of review and we can confirm these people have been unlawfully administered insulin. 'However, we have yet to establish if this has been a significant contributing factor to each of their deaths. A number of toxicology and other tests to try and establish causes of death are continuing and may take some weeks to complete.' Two other patients at the hospital - George Keep and Vera Pearson, both aged 84 - were also linked to the inquiry but their deaths were earlier ruled out as not suspicious. Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney said: 'The decision to rule out the deaths of these six people (including George Keep and Vera Pearson) will provide their families with some level of reassurance. 'They will now be able to continue grieving for their loved ones in the knowledge that they have not been taken from them in suspicious circumstances. 'I know relatives of the confirmed victims affected and the public in general will be anxious and want answers and we are working as quickly as we can without jeopardising the quality or integrity of the investigation. 'This is an exceptionally complex and difficult process and one that cannot be rushed or completed quickly. 'Should we identify any further deaths that will be investigated by us as part of this investigation, we will, of course, make the relevant announcement once we have spoken to family members.' He added that his detectives were presently looking at 30 potential victims of the saline contamination, including Ms Arden, Mr Lancaster and Mr Weaver. More than 300 people have now been interviewed out of a pool of around 700 - consisting of staff, patients and visitors - who could could have had access to the area during the time the tampering may have taken place.","Milk given to patient by staff but unharmed .

They’ve been buried for more than 200 years around 5,000 miles away from home - but it could finally be time for 13 U.S. sailors to come back. A veterans' group wants Congress to return the remains of the Americans buried in Libya after they died  in 1804 during the First Barbary War. The American Legion has been lobbying since the Libya uprising began six months ago for the crew, who died when their explosives ship blew up. Coming home? The crew who died in 1804 when their explosives-packed ship blew up was led by Master Commandant Richard Somers . Different location: Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia could be a more fitting final resting place than Tripoli, if the American Legion gets its way . The crew was led by Master Commandant Richard Somers and Lieutenant Henry Wadsworth, whose nephew was poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. ‘It's the best chance we've had in a long time,’ Tim Tetz, of the American Legion, told the Huffington Post. ‘We've got a change of politics in Libya. ‘We've got family members who have stood up and said: “We want to have our family members brought home.” ‘We've got the will and might of America to say: “Let's respect those who fought our wars for us, and that includes all wars”.’ The phrase 'to the shores of Tripoli' in the official U.S. Marine Corps song has its origins in the First Barbary War, which ran from 1801 to 1805. Battle: This oil panting, Decatur Boarding the Tripolitan Gunboat, by Dennis Malone Carter, shows the bombardment of Tripoli in August 1804 . Ship shape: This oil painting, the Bombardment of Tripoli by Commodore Preble's squadron, was by Michael Felice Corne and is also set in August 1804 . The American Legion secured the backing of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, reported the Huffington Post. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson ordered American Navy vessels to the Mediterranean Sea in 1801. It followed regular raids against American ships by pirates from the Barbary states of Morocco, Algeria, Tunis, and Tripolitania. American sailors were abducted and ransomed back before sustained action begun in 1803. A U.S. victory came in 1805 and a peace treaty was drawn up. It got an amendment to a House bill telling the Defense Secretary to ‘exhume and transfer the remains’ of some servicemen buried in Tripoli. But the Senate has not followed suit - and the group is concerned that ex-serviceman Senator John McCain could get in the way. ‘He has expressed some concern that he doesn't want to see it pass, which is disconcerting to us, and we've tried to influence him,’ Mr Tetz said. The U.S. Navy is also known to be opposed to the American Legion's desire for the bodies to be returned. Film: To The Shores Of Tripoli was a 1942 war movie which took its name from the Marines song lyric that was inspired by the First Barbary War . Uprising: Libyan rebels raced into Tripoli in a lightning advance on Sunday that met little resistance as Colonel Gaddafi's defenders melted away . However an American Legion spokesman told the Huffington Post that it is unacceptable for the sailors to be buried in a ‘hostile land’. ‘It's the best chance we've had in a . long time. We've got a change of politics in Libya' Tim Tetz, the American Legion . He said some are buried under Green Square, where Colonel Gaddafi’s government has held protest rallies. The resting place of others is a Protestant cemetery that he described as a 'shambles'. ‘So this is not the way to treat those who serve America,’ he said, adding that there is space for the bodies in Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia.","13 sailors died in 1804 after explosives ship blew up .

More than 70,000 people enthusiastically cheered for Pope Benedict XVI last night, as he drove through Berlin’s Olympic Stadium in his popemobile, greeting the faithful and kissing several babies. 'Looking into the wide expanse of the Olympic Stadium, which you are crowding in such a great number, fills me with great joy and confidence,' he told the crowd in Germany. Built by the Nazis for the 1936 games, the Pope held an open-air service at the stadium, on his first state visit to his homeland, which saw him being greeted by dozens of Roman Catholics earlier in the day.

The faithful appeared moved as they left after the service held in German and Latin. 'It was beautiful. The service surpassed all my expectations,' said Heidi Frank, 49, who had travelled 310 miles from the southern German city of Regensburg to see the pope. 'The atmosphere was impressive - the entire community praying, you don’t get that every day,' said Jaqueline Hoehns, 21, from Berlin. After the Bavarian-born pontiff, 83, was met at at Berlin’s Tegel airport by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Christian Wulff earlier in the day, the pope also addressed Germany’s parliament in the historic Reichstag building.

Amid scattered protests outside and a boycott by some lawmakers, Benedict began his first state visit to Germany on Thursday in a bid to stem the tide of Catholics leaving the church while acknowledging the damage caused by the clerical sex abuse scandal. The Pope spoke for 20 minutes in the Reichstag, which was torched in 1933 in an incident used by Hitler to strengthen his grip on power. 'We Germans know from our own experience' what happens when power is corrupted, Benedict said, describing Nazis as a 'highly organised band of robbers, capable of threatening the whole world and driving it to the edge of the abyss'. But he said even under the Nazi dictatorship resistance movements stuck to their beliefs at a great risk, 'thereby doing a great service to justice and to humanity as a whole'. He also urged all Germans not to ignore religion. Benedict gives communion during the Eucharist at the Olympic stadium... The pope said the service filled him with great joy and confidence .

'Even today, there is ultimately nothing else we could wish for but a listening heart - the capacity to discern between good and evil, and thus to establish true law, to serve justice and peace,' he said. Benedict also voiced strong support for Germany’s ecological movement, calling it 'a cry for fresh air which must not be ignored or pushed aside'. After the speech, he met with a 15-member Jewish delegation, noting that it was in Berlin that the annihilation of European Jews was organised. 'The supposedly ""almighty"" Adolf Hitler was a pagan idol, who wanted to take the place of the biblical God,' Benedict said. according to a prepared text.

'Germany is a country that over centuries was strongly marked by religion and religious wars,' Lammert said. 'A country whose Christian traditions of belief also influence the constitution we have today.' But flagging Christian influence in Europe was one of Benedict’s key themes. 'We are witnessing a growing indifference to religion in society,' he said at a formal welcoming ceremony at the German president’s Bellevue palace.

He called religion a foundation for a successful society and said its values were essential for freedom. Benedict said the presidential palace, which was destroyed in World War II, was a reminder of German history. 'A clear look at the past, even at its dark pages, enables us to learn from it and to receive an impetus for the present,' the Pope said.

The pope expressed his 'hope of an ever-more intense ethical renewal for the good of beloved Italy'. The pontiff made no direct reference to the sex scandal which has engulfed the 74 year-old premier in recent days just as financial troubles have raised fears of a Greek-style debt crisis, but his comments carried a clear resonance amid a barrage of newspaper coverage of the goings-on.

A nine-year-old cagefighter has appealed for the chance to carry on taking part in the contests claiming he enjoys the cheering crowds and insists 'it's good fun.' Kian Makinson was filmed taking part in a fight with an eight-year-old boy whose father has requested he remain anonymous, kicking, shoving and grappling in front of baying adults at a social club in Preston. His opponent, who has not been named, was left in tears, and the video footage has sparked outrage among child and medical experts, who called for a police and social services investigation. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Kian MacKinson with his instructors Marcus Holt and Steven Nightingale. Kian likes cage fighting because he loves the 'crowd cheering really loud' However, Kian hit back last night, telling the Daily Star: 'I like the atmosphere when fighting. It's exciting. The crowd cheering is really loud. 'It is good fun. I enjoy it and I am quite good at it. I am more confident when I'm wrestling.' Meanwhile, his father Nick Hartley, 33, a breakdown recovery driver, claimed the discipline of the sport helped his son, who used to be naughty, learn respect. He said there was no . harm in the sport adding: 'If he wasn't cage fighting he would probably . be chucking stones at buses and giving people grief.' Last night, legal experts warned parents who encourage their young children to take part in cage fighting contests could be jailed for child cruelty. They face sentences of up to six months . for allowing a boy or girl of primary school age to take part in the . sport – described as  ‘barbaric’ by the Culture Secretary. Officials also said the Greenlands New Labour Club in . Preston, Lancashire, is to be investigated over whether it broke its . licence conditions. Brutal: The boys are not wearing padding or head gear as they grapple and slam each other into the canvas . Upsetting: The young boy seen here is crying in the middle of a fight, and is then attended by medical experts who check if he can carry on with the bout in a Preston working club . Battle: Kian MacKinson, nine, with an eight-year-old whose father has asked for his face to be obscured . A source at the Crown Prosecution . Service said: ‘A young child being forced to take part in any violent . sport could constitute child cruelty. As such, a failure to protect that child from harm could lead to a minimum 12-week sentence or a maximum 26-week sentence.’ Social . services bosses in Lancashire confirmed they had launched an inquiry . into the cage fighting, which is also known as mixed martial arts, to . ‘consider any child safety concerns’. Parental support: Kian with his father Nick Hartley, the youngster features in the shocking video which shows hundreds of baying adults goading the primary-age boys to fight each other . Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday condemned the fighting among children as young as eight as ‘barbaric’. ‘Getting more young people doing sport is great but I do ask myself whether it really does have to be in a cage,’ he said. ‘It feels very barbaric and I know there are concerns about children that young doing a sport like that.’ He added he was ‘shocked and surprised’ by claims there were no restrictions on children appearing in such adult environments. His comments came after the British Medical Association, the NSPCC and . Safechild branded child cage fighting ‘disturbing and sick’. A British . Association of Martial Arts spokesman insisted: ‘Children this young . shouldn’t be involved in cage fighting.’ Lancashire Police officers have decided to take no further action either on a child safety level or licensing of the premises. Professional appearance: Just like in an adult event, the tiny fighters have an entourage. Seconds out: The boys are brought together in the middle of the cage fighting ring, prepared to do battle . Grappling: The pair begin their fight slowly, testing out the space between them as they start their bout . It emerged last night, however, that council chiefs have ordered a . licence review for the Greenlands Labour Club and will ask the venue not . to put on any similar events involving juveniles. JAMES SLACK: 'This was about giving grown-ups, swigging lager, an evening of blood-thirsty excitement, to match that of adult cage fighting. In Britain, we have long had laws which ban dog fighting. Rightly, it is believed that inciting animals to hurt each other for the entertainment of their human masters is barbaric. Which rather begs the question: in what sort of country do the police pursue with the full force of the law those who encourage dogs to fight one another, but turn a blind eye when adults do the same with children?' Read more here . The deputy leader of Preston City Council, John Swindells, said: ‘I am . appalled by the incident of cage fighting involving children taking . place in Preston. ‘Having checked the club’s licence there is a condition that children . should not be on the premises at public events after 6pm and I think it . needs to be looked into whether this condition has been breached. ‘As such, I have now made a request for the licence at Greenlands Labour Club to be reviewed. A formal licensing review process will now follow.’ That could take up to three months as the club is allowed 28 days to make representations on the matter. A similar period is then opened up for members of the public to have their say. The shocking video that emerged on Wednesday shows Kian and the unnamed boy fighting without protective padding or head gear. One of them is shown apparently receiving medical attention for a leg injury and bursting into tears. The event was held almost a fortnight . ago with about 250 adults paying £25 a ticket to watch 14 fights. The . other clashes involved semi-professional adults. Sources said the night was a boisterous alcohol-fuelled affair. Sharefight, the company commissioned to . film the event, said the video had been removed from the internet ‘out . of respect’ for parents and others who had shown concern.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:17 PM on 24th September 2011 . On trial: Conrad Murray, pictured here in February, was in court today . A 12-member jury has been chosen for the trial of Michael Jackson's . personal physician Dr Conrad Murray. Seven men and five women were selected after a process that involved completing a 30-page questionnaire about Jackson and the media coverage of his death in June 2009 in Los Angeles. A pool of 84 potential jurors began yesterday although 10 were soon dismissed for hardship reasons and 16 others who were taken off the panel through attorneys' challenges. With 27 prospective panellists in or near the jury box at a time, defense attorney Edward Chernoff asked them if they could honestly say they had never read, heard or seen anything about Jackson's lifestyle, family or personality, or about his own client, Dr. Conrad Murray. None raised their hands. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren asked one of the potential jurors why she had put an exclamation mark on her jury questionnaire. She had responded: 'No!' to a question about whether she had seen This Is It, the documentary made from rehearsal footage of the singer in the days before his death from propofol intoxication on June 25, 2009, at the age of 50.'That was an emphatic no,' she responded. 'I wasn't interested.' Sixteen of the first batch of potential jurors were dismissed in rapid fashion after attorneys from both sides used eight peremptory challenges each to excuse those they did not want on the trial. Attorneys on each side had 10 peremptory challenges, meaning each side had two left heading into the afternoon court session. Dr Conrad Murray has pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter. The trial is due to start on Tuesday. Prosecutors say Dr Murray caused the pop star's death by giving him a powerful anaesthetic, propofol, to help him sleep. He faces up to four years in prison if convicted. He has been free on $75,000 bail since being charged in February 2010. Pop idol: The singer died in June 2009 . The jurors were selected yesterday after less than six hours of questioning by Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor and lawyers for the defence and prosecution. Half of the chosen panelists are Caucasian, five are Hispanic and one is African-American. The jurors have a wide range of professions, including a bus driver, paralegal and a bookseller.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:48 AM on 18th August 2011 . A new species of eel has been discovered which is so old that it retains its dinosaur-era characteristics and has been branded a 'living fossil'. The eel was found in a cave beneath the Pacific Ocean in the Republic of Palau, which is around 500 miles east of the Philippines. The reddish brown eel is just 1.7 inches long and has many of the hallmarks of the primitive eels of the Mezozoic era - some 200million years ago. First eel: The new species discovered in an undersea cave is a 'living fossil', astonishingly similar to the first eels that swam some 200 million years ago . Such is its anatomical age, the species has required an entirely new breed of classification from scientists, because none of the other 819 species, which are grouped into 19 families, would suffice. It has been called Protoanguilla Palau, which is a mix of Greek and Latin meaning 'first eel', and is the only example of the newly-created taxonomic family, Protoanguillidae. The discovery was made by a team from the Natural History Museum and Institute in Chiba, Japan, led by Masaki Miya, which reported it s findings in the British journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Among the ages-old features of the eel are a disproportionately large head compared to its short body, distinctive gills and iridescent fins with white piping. 'The eel looks so bizarre - large head with relatively short body and various unique, internal characters - that no ichthyologist, including us, correctly identified it as a member of true eel at first sight,' Miya told Discovery News. Eight specimens of the P. Palau were collected by hand using nets and lamps, varying between 3-4 inches long, and were DNA tested to ensure they were part of the eels genetic family. Its cave home is at the western end of a fringing reef - one of three types of reef, alongside barrier reefs and atolls - of Ngemelis Island, Palau. The cave in an undersea ridge is estimated to be between 60 and 70 million years old, and while it may have once been more widely populous - and could still be - it is currently only known to exist in this one location. That has led to discussions about making it an endangered species to protect it from curious divers and avaricious aquariums looking for unique exhibits. It has also raised as many questions as it has answered for evolutionary biologists, with 'living fossils' being rare discoveries. The term was first used by Charles Darwin in his book On The Origin of Species to describe species that have survived for millions of years with barely any evolution due to 'having inhabited a confined area, and from having thus been exposed to less severe competition.'","Protoanguilla Palau is more than 200million years old .

The crew of the International Space Station was forced to evacuate today after a fast-approaching piece of space junk was detected. The six astronauts sought refuge in two Russian Soyuz spacecraft until the debris had passed at 12.08pm GMT. Radar-tracking had identified the space junk as it hurtled towards the ISS - it ended up passing within around 820ft. Safety measure: The six astronauts aboard the ISS were forced to evacuate today after a fast-approaching piece of space junk was detected . Once the all-clear was given, the crew returned to their duties. Safety procedures are initiated should an unidentified object be heading in the direction of the ISS. Astronauts are instructed to head to the docked spacecraft in case a quick getaway is needed. Station . commander Andrey Borisenko, Alexander Samokutyaev and Ronald Garan took . shelter aboard the Soyuz TMA-21 spacecraft docked to the Poisk module. Since the first object, Sputnik One, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris. The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel. It is estimated that there are 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit. Sergei Volkov, Michael Fossum and Furukawa sheltered aboard the Soyuz TMA-02M spacecraft docked to the Rassvet module. A Pentagon report warned last year that there is so much junk whizzing around Earth that any collision in space could cause a knock-on effect that would destroy vital communications satellites. Earlier this year the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and Nitto Seimo Co announced a plan to solve the problem by sweeping up damaged satellites and space shuttles. They will attach the thin metal net, which is several miles wide, to a satellite and then launch the pair into space. Once in orbit, the net will be released at which point it will start picking up space junk in its path during a journey that is expected to last several weeks. High-tech litter: An artist's impression of space junk in low-Earth orbit . The net will become charged with electricity causing magnetic fields to pulled to Earth. Both the net and its contents will burn up as they enter Earth's atmosphere. The possibility of a satellite crashing into a hunk of space debris has worried scientists for years. One collision could send thousands of pieces of debris spinning out, potentially destroying other satellites. Television signals, weather forecasts, global-positioning navigation and international phone connections are just some of the services at risk. The uncontrolled chain reaction could make some orbits unusable for both commercial or military satellites, according to the U.S Space Posture Review sent to Congress in March 2010.","The crew of six sought refuge in two Russian Soyuz spacecraft .

"John Kalymon insists all he did was guard streets and police station . By . Anna Edwards . Last updated at 1:53 PM on 21st September 2011 . Ordered out: John Kalymon, once known as Iwan Kalymon, will be forced to go to 'whichever country will take him' A former Nazi living in America is facing deportation because of his role in World War II. The immigration appeals panel dismissed the appeal of  John Kalymon of Troy, Michigan, who was ordered to be removed from the U.S. because of his involvement in the brutal persecution. The Board of Immigration Appeals upheld an immigration judge's decision that John Kalymon of Troy, Michigan, served voluntarily as an armed member of the Nazi-sponsored Ukrainian Auxiliary Police and shot Jews. Kalymon's lawyer, Elias Xenos, said he would next appeal to a federal court in Cincinnati. Kalymon has said he did little more than guard streets and rooms in police stations in Lviv, which was part of Poland until 1939. He's now in poor health. In January, U.S. Immigration Judge Elizabeth Hacker ordered Kalymon, now 90, to be deported to Germany, Ukraine, Poland or any other country that will take him. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said Kalymon and accomplices in the Ukrainian Police were indispensable participants in Nazi Germany's campaign to exterminate the Jews. Mr Breuer said thousands of Jewish men, women and children were murdered in Lviv or rounded up and shipped to the Nazi death camp in Belzec or to Nazi forced labor camps, CNN news website reported. In a news release last month, the Justice Department said Kalymon 'personally shot Jews while serving, killing at least one' and 'participated in violent anti-Jewish operations in which Jews were forcibly deported to be murdered in gas chambers and to serve as slave labourers.'

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 8:24 AM on 21st September 2011 . Colonel Gaddafi has insisted his regime is still alive in Libya and labelled the rebel takeover of all but a few pockets of the country a 'charade'. The Libyan leader got his defiant message out on a Syrian-based satellite station, Al-Rai TV, that has become his main mouthpiece since Tripoli fell last month. There was no audio in the message, but he urged supporters to continue fighting and said NATO airstrikes in the country would not last forever. He spoke ahead of U.S. President Barack Obama's speech at the United Nations, at which he pledged to support Libya's fledgling government. He met the National Transitional Council's chairman, Mustafa Abdel Jalil in a one on one before praising the international community - who he said should take pride in liberating the country. Defiance: Former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has claimed rebel gains in the country are a 'charade' in a message broadcast on Syrian Arraj TV . Gaddafi issued his defiant message just as rebel forces seized the airport and fort in Sabha, one of the last strongholds of forces loyal to Gaddafi which also controls the main route south out of Libya. Ahmed Bani, a military spokesman for the National Transitional Council (NTC, said: 'Our forces are there in the airport and in the castle... our flags are flying there.' Sabha, 480 miles south of Tripoli and overlooked by an old fort built by Libya's former Italian colonial rulers, controls the main road into neighbouring Niger, an escape route used by members of Gaddafi's entourage. Any advance on the town would be an important boost for government forces who have struggled to contain disunity in their ranks and faced stark reversals on the battlefield. Setbacks: Libyan rebels take a break on top of a vehicle outside Bani Walid. Forces loyal to Gaddafi have beaten back repeated assaults in the town . In hiding: Gaddafi has disappeared since Tripoli fell last month, but has sent repeated messages to Syrian TV stations . Nearly a month after Gaddafi was driven from power, his loyalist holdouts have beaten back repeated assaults by NTC forces at Bani Walid and Sirte. NTC forces with rocket launchers and artillery gathered outside Sirte yesterday, preparing for a fresh assault as hundreds of families fled the town. Humanitarian groups have voiced concerns over reported conditions in the town. Electricity and phone lines have been cut off and residents said homes and cars had been destroyed. Abubakr, a resident fleeing Sirte, said: 'People are fed up. There are explosions going off everywhere and you don't know where the bullets will come from next. 'Bullets are coming down from above. People are just firing randomly.' Stockpile: A vast store of ammunition was discovered in a government store in central Tripoli by rebel fighters . The NTC had denied claims by Gaddafi's spokesman that 17 mercenaries - some of them British and French - were captured in the fight for Bani Walid. Moussa Ibrahim did not offer any proof of his claim, but said the men were technical experts and included consultative officers. He said: 'Most of them are French, one of them is from an Asian country that has not been identified, two English people and one Qatari.' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said there were 'no French mercenaries in Libya', while the British Foreign Office said it had no information on the report. Western nations have sent special forces in the past, and media reports have revealed private security firms aided the rebels in training, targeting and leadership. Infighting: A rebel fires an RPG outside Bani Walid. There have been reports of tensions amongst rebel forces trying to take the town . NTC forces yesterday arrested pro-Gaddafi mercenary leader Belqasem Al-Abaaj, who had been operating in the south of the country. However, the NTC, still based in the eastern city of Benghazi, has faced questions about whether it can unify a country divided on tribal and local lines. A long-promised attempt to set up a more inclusive interim government fell apart on Sunday night when interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril . failed to receive backing for his new cabinet. U.S. President Barack Obama speaks at the United Nations General Assembly in New York today . The support shown by President Obama and other world leaders in New York is therefore particularly timely. Mr Obama promised the Libyan people that the world will stand with them as they reshape their country following the fall of Moammar Gadhafi's regime. He warned that there would still be difficult days ahead as Gadhafi loyalists make a final stand and the country's provisional leadership grapples with the complex task of setting up a new government. But Obama said it was clear that Libya was now in the hands of the people. 'After decades of iron rule by one man, it will take time to build the institutions needed for a democratic Libya. I'm sure there will be days of frustration,' Obama said. 'But if we have learned anything these many months, it is this - do not underestimate the aspirations and will of the Libyan people.' 'Just as the world stood by you in your struggle to be free, we will now stand with you in your struggle to realise the peace and prosperity that freedom can bring,' he said. President Obama meets with the Transitional National Council (TNC) Chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil in New York before praising the efforts of the international community . Obama praised the international community for having 'the courage and the collective will to act' in Libya. He said that while global powers cannot and should not intervene every time there is an injustice in the world, there are occasions when nations must join forces to prevent the killing of innocent civilians. 'Our international coalition stopped the regime in its tracks and saved countless lives, and gave the Libyan people the time and space to prevail,' Obama said. The U.S. now recognszes the NTC as Libya's legitimate government. Obama announced Tuesday that the U.S. ambassador was heading back to Tripoli to lead a newly reopened American embassy there. Obama called on Jalil and other NTC leaders to ensure a timely democratic transition in Libya, including free and fair elections. Obama said the NATO-led bombing campaign in Libya will continue as long as civilians are threatened. And he urged Gaddafi loyalists to lay down their arms and join the new Libya, declaring, 'the old regime is over.' 'Today, the Libyan people are writing a new chapter in the life of their nation,' Obama said. 'We will stand with you in your struggle to realise the peace and prosperity that freedom can bring.' He said the U.S. ambassador was now on his way back to Tripoli and 'this week, the American flag that was lowered before our embassy was attacked will be raised again.'","Former dictator still in hiding four weeks after fall of Tripoli .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 10:53 PM on 23rd September 2011 . It’s been a crucial topic hanging over the Republican presidential debate so far - and there’s already a twist. Texas Governor Rick Perry, 61, claimed last night he was ‘lobbied’ by a cervical cancer sufferer to require young girls to receive the HPV vaccine. But it turns out according to ABC News he only met Heather Burcham after launching an executive order in February 2007 - which ultimately failed. Texas Governor: Rick Perry, pictured at last night's debate, said he was 'lobbied' by a cervical cancer sufferer to require young girls to receive the HPV vaccine . Mr Perry and Houston schoolteacher Ms Burcham, 31, became unlikely friends over his support of the human papillomavirus vaccine. A spokesman for Governor Perry defended his comments on Friday as '100 per cent accurate'. 'The anti-cancer HPV vaccine requirement was never implemented in Texas,' the spokesman told MailOnline. 'The issue was hotly debated in 2007. 'Governor Perry met Heather during . HPV legislative debates after the executive order was issued. She . lobbied the legislature and Governor in favour of the anti-cancer . vaccine. 'Ultimately, lawmakers overturned the executive order and Governor Perry allowed (a bill that overturned the order) to become law. 'Governor Perry and Heather established a friendship and stayed in contact until her death from cervical cancer.' He said at Thursday night’s GOP . debate that he spent lots of time with Ms Burcham, who had stage four . cervical cancer and died in July 2007. ‘I got lobbied on this issue. I got lobbied by a 31-year-old young lady who had stage four cervical cancer,’ Mr Perry said, reported ABC News. But since she died he changed his mind on the HPV vaccine and sided against it with GOP presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann. ‘I readily admitted we should have had . an opt-in but I don’t know what part of opt out most parents don’t . get,’ he said at the Florida debate. ‘The fact is I erred on the side of . life and I will always err on the side of life as a Governor (and) as a . President of the United States.’ Ms Burcham was reportedly actually lobbying the . Texas legislature to uphold Governor Perry’s order after he had issued . it - rather than before. He wanted sixth-grade girls to receive . the HPV vaccine, but he was ruled against by the legislature and gave up on the mandate, reported ABC. Sufferer: Heather Burcham, who died from cervical cancer in 2007, bonded with Mr Perry over a campaign to make the HPV vaccine mandatory . Emotional plea: In an interview with ABC News before she died, Ms Burcham begged parents to do their own research into cervical cancer . Governor Perry often refers to Ms Burcham in public speeches and spoke at her memorial service in July 2007, reported ABC. 'I got lobbied on this issue. I got lobbied by a 31-year-old young lady who had stage four cervical cancer' Texas Governor Rick Perry . ‘Though some could not see the . benefits of the HPV vaccine through the prism of politics, some day they . will,’ he said in July 2007. Minnesota Representative Mrs Bachmann believes giving the vaccine will encourage promiscuity and even 'mental retardation'. Cervical cancer kills around 3,700 . women in the U.S. each year, but Mr Perry now calls his support of the . HPV vaccine 'a mistake'.","Texas Governor met Heather Burcham who died in 2007 .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Last updated at 10:23 AM on 21st September 2011 . Targeted: Detectives wanted to obtain information on who told Guardian reporters murdered Milly Dowler's phone was hacked . Scotland Yard made a humiliating climbdown last night over its controversial bid to force the Guardian newspaper to disclose confidential sources. A potentially explosive hearing at the Old Bailey was abandoned after senior officers spent a day locked in meetings with legal advisers. Anti-corruption detectives wanted to make the newspaper reveal how it obtained sensitive information behind its reports on the News of the World phone hacking scandal. But after obtaining advice from prosecutors, police dropped their bid and a question mark remains over whether a fresh challenge will be made. The abrupt U-turn came four days after the Met’s actions sparked widespread outrage and as chiefs endured a torrent of criticism. Detectives wanted to obtain a court order demanding reporters hand over documents revealing who told them that murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s phone had been hacked. They claimed the Official Secrets Act, . which has special powers usually aimed at espionage, may have been . breached in July when the story was published. But . politicians said the move was an ‘outrageous abuse’ while Guardian . editor Alan Rusbridger labelled the bid ‘vindictive and . disproportionate’. Payout: The Dowler family (from left, Bob, Gemma and Sally) have been offered £3m in compensation after murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler's phone was hacked by the News of the World following her disappearance . Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme this morning, he said: 'I just hope that in our effort to clean up some of the worst practices we don't completely overreact and try and clamp down on perfectly normal and applaudable reporting. 'This was a regrettable incident, but let's hope it's over.' The attempt to obtain a court production order later this week was abandoned after police consulted experts at the Crown Prosecution Service. They asked for more information about the investigation and extra time to consider material already gathered. The development is particularly embarrassing for police as it appears to indicate they failed to consult prosecutors properly in the first place. The revelations that Milly had been targeted by phone hackers provoked widespread anger and rekindled the scandal. In . the aftermath, Met chief Sir Paul Stephenson and Assistant Commissioner . John Yates quit, the News of the World closed and a judicial inquiry . into the scandal was opened. A detective on the phone hacking . investigation, codenamed Operation Weeting, is being investigated for . breaching the Official Secrets Act and misconduct in public office. Aftermath: In the wake of the scandal Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson (left) and Assistant Commissioner John Yates quit . Alan Rusbridger, editor of The Guardian, pictured, had branded the Met's  demands as 'vindictive and disproportionate' He remains on bail and has been suspended from duty. Guardian . reporter Amelia Hill, who wrote several articles on the scandal, has . been interviewed under caution as part of the leak inquiry. A Met spokesman said the force has decided not to pursue ‘at this time’ the application for a production order. He said: ‘There was no intention to target journalists or disregard journalists’ obligations to protect their sources. ‘It is not acceptable for police officers to leak information about any investigation, let alone one as sensitive and high profile as Operation Weeting.’ The spokesman added that the inquiry into whether a police officer leaked information from the phone hacking investigation will continue. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: ‘The CPS has asked that more information be provided to its lawyers and has said that more time will be needed fully to consider the matter. ‘As a result the scheduled court hearing will not go ahead on Friday. ‘The Met will consider what application, if any, it will make in due course, once it has received advice from the CPS.’",Guardian editor: This was a regrettable incident.

"Ministry of Defence said members of the armed forces 'acted wrongly' One family has already rejected the offer and is determined to take the soldiers to court . By . Steve Doughty . Last updated at 11:15 PM on 22nd September 2011 . Families of demonstrators killed or wounded on Bloody Sunday are to be paid compensation, it was disclosed yesterday. Ministry of Defence officials have written to lawyers for victims’ families promising payments and the ministry said it intended to deal with claims as quickly as possible. The payments – which are likely to total about £10million – may at last bring to an end the expensive legal wrangling over the killing of 14 people in Londonderry by soldiers of the Parachute Regiment in January 1972. Carnage: Soldiers face the crowd in the Bloody Sunday riot in Londonderry, Northern Ireland . Bloody Sunday became a spur to IRA recruiting over the 25 years of violence that followed. David Cameron apologised for the shootings last year after the publication of the Saville inquiry report into Bloody Sunday. The report, which took 12 years and £200m to produce, found that ‘out-of-control’ paratroopers had engaged in an indefensible shooting spree. Lord Saville chaired the Bloody Sunday Inquiry . In the 15 months since the Prime Minister’s apology, prosecutors in Northern Ireland appear to have made no progress towards any prosecution of the soldiers involved, and a criminal trial is widely regarded as an impossibility 40 years after the event. The MoD indicated its intention to pay compensation in a reply to law firm Madden and Finucane, which represents many of the families. The firm asked what the Government was doing to compensate victims’ families ‘for the loss of their loved ones, the wounding of others, and the shameful allegations which besmirched their good name for many years’. There was no indication of the likely scale of the payments yesterday. One pointer may be the amount of compensation paid to the family of solicitor Pat Finucane, founder of Madden and Finucane, following his murder by loyalist gunmen in front of his wife and three children at their Belfast home in 1989. According to documents later published by the European Court of Human Rights, Mr Finucane’s widow Geraldine was paid £500,000 under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. Celebration: John Kelly, whose brother Michael . was shot on Bloody Sunday, holds his arms aloft after the Saville Report . concluded British soldiers had acted unlawfully . Occasion: Thousands packed the square outside Londonderry's Guildhall to await the verdict of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry . 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre where civilians were killed by soldiers of the 1st Parachute Regiment during a civil rights march in Londonderry1972 Lord Widgery's inquiry heard testimonies from the soldiers, who claimed they had been shot at, while the marchers insisted that no one from the march was armed. Lord Widgery produced a report that took the army's side. 1998 Tony Blair said a new inquiry would be held2000 The Bloody Sunday Inquiry opened properly in 2000 when formal public hearings began at the Guildhall in Derry. The Inquiry held public hearings on 116 days over the year, clocking up more than 600 hours of evidence. 2004 Judges retired on 23 November 2004. They reconvened once again on 16 December to listen to testimony from another key witness.2010 The Saville Report was handed to government lawyers on 24 March 2010, twelve years after the inquiry was established.2009 The chairman of the inquiry, Lord Saville, revealed that the inquiry would be handed to the government in March 2010, some 9 years after the first evidence was heard; a delay which Lord Saville admitted was 'extremely disappointing'. 2010 The report of the inquiry was published on 15 June 2010 and thousands of people walked the path that the civil rights marchers had taken on Bloody Sunday before they were shot at. Payments at a similar level would suggest a compensation bill to taxpayers totalling around £10m – a small sum compared with the cost of the Saville inquiry. Swift compensation payments could also avoid political rows which might threaten to upset Northern Ireland’s fragile peace. But yesterday, sisters Linda and Kate Nash, whose teenage brother William was among those who died, said they found the idea of compensation ‘repulsive’ and would refuse any payment. Linda Nash added: ‘Not under any circumstances will I ever accept money for the loss of my brother. ‘I find it repulsive taking anything from the MoD. 'I've already told . my legal team I want to go forward with prosecutions.' Miss Nash noted that Britain in the early . 1970s had offered her mother a cursory compensation payment of £250. 'She didn't take it then and I will be . doing the same,' she said. Bloody . Sunday changed the course of the violence that erupted in Northern . Ireland in the late 1960s and helped to make 1972 the deadliest year of . the 'Troubles'. Troops . opened fire after a march descended into rioting in the Bogside, a . nationalist area of Londonderry. They killed 13 people and wounded 14 . others, one of whom died later. Unionists . warned last month against 'rewriting the history of the Troubles' by . portraying British forces as the only guilty party during the . conflict. The . Bloody Sunday Inquiry, authorised by former Prime Minister Tony Blair in . the immediate build-up to the Good Friday peace accord of 1998, was . empowered to find the truth behind the British Army's worst act of . violence in Northern Ireland. Families of the dead had demanded such a . probe for decades. The investigation produced a 5,000-page report based on evidence from 921 witnesses, 2,500 written statements and 60 volumes of written evidence. Lord Saville gave the ex-paratroopers, now in their 60s and 70s, broad protections from criminal charges as well as anonymity in the witness box, citing the risk that IRA dissidents might target them in retaliation. But legal experts say wiggle room remains for prosecutions and, more likely, civil lawsuits against the retired soldiers, particularly those who were found to have lied during their testimony.","Ministry of Defence said members of the armed forces 'acted wrongly'

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 1:08 PM on 23rd September 2011 . Defiant: Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh at his residence in Saudi Arabia last month . President Ali Abdullah Saleh returned today to the violence-torn Yemeni capital after more than three months of medical treatment in Saudi Arabia in a surprise move certain to further enflame battles between forces loyal to him and his opponents. Saleh left Yemen for Saudi Arabia in early June after he was seriously injured in a rocket attack on his presidential compound in the capital Sanaa. His departure fueled hopes that he would be forced to step down, but instead he staunchly refused to resign, frustrating protesters who have been taking to the streets nearly daily since February demanding an end to his 33-year old rule. Yemen slipped deeper into chaos during his absence, even as the United States and Saudi Arabia pushed him to hand over power. The worst violence yet erupted this week with battles between Saleh loyalists and his armed opponents that have so far killed around 100 people, mostly protesters in Sanaa. The elite Republican Guards, led by Saleh's son Ahmed, have been engaged in street battles and exchanges of shelling over the city with army units that defected to the opposition and tribal fighters who support the protesters. The fighting continued even after Saleh returned at dawn on Friday. Heavy clashes and thuds of mortars were heard throughout the night in Sanaa and into morning hours. One person was killed overnight after mortars hit the square in central Sanaa where protesters demanding Sale's ouster have been camped out for months, a medical official said on condition of anonymity. For the protest leaders, Saleh's return bodes ill for the already explosive situation. 'His return means more divisions, more escalation and confrontations,'said Abdel-Hadi al-Azizi, a protest leader. 'We are on a very critical escalation.' The anti-Saleh protesters have called for more rallies after Friday prayers, and a massive turnout is expected despite the latest bout of fighting. The United States and Saudi Arabia have been trying to dissuade Saleh from returning home in hopes of working out a peaceful handover of power in the impoverished, deeply divided country where both have strong strategic interests. Demanding change: Yemeni protesters flash the victory sign during a rally yesterday calling for the removal of President Saleh . Washington in particular wants a stable regime in Yemen to fight al-Qaida's branch in the country, seen as the most active offshoot of the terror network after it plotted several attacks on American soil in recent years. Al-Qaida-linked Islamic militants have already taken advantage of Yemen's turmoil, seizing control of several towns in the near-lawless south. Saleh was severely burned and suffered other injuries when an explosion went off in a mosque where he was praying in his Sanaa presidential compound on June 3. From the moment he was rushed to Saudi Arabia for treatment, he and his allies insisted his absence was temporary and that he would return to continue his rule. But even some Yemeni officials had recently predicted he would stay in Saudi Arabia - and the timing of his return Friday was a surprise. Yemeni TV announced his return Friday . morning, but did not show any footage of him. It aired old footage of . Saleh at public events along with images of fireworks and patriotic . songs, accompanied by a scroll from the Interior Ministry, urging . citizens not to fire celebratory gunfire in the air in their joy over . Saleh's return because the shooting was dangerous. 'So long as you are well, we are all well. Yemen is well,' one song ran. Pain: A woman breaks down in tears as she waits outside a makeshift clinic for news about her son, who was injured during clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces . Unrest: A man looks at pictures of protesters who have been killed over the last five days in assaults by army troops loyal President Saleh, in Sana'a, Yemen . The TV report said Saleh was in good health. Officials in his office confirmed that he had returned on a private plane. The TV also said there would be a gathering of his Saleh's supporters later in the day in Sanaa. It was unclear if Saleh would address that rally. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia have been trying to persuade Saleh to sign onto a deal proposed by Gulf Arab states, under which he would resign and hand power to his vice president to form a national unity government in return for immunity from any prosecution. The mercurial Saleh has repeated promised to sign the agreement, then refused at the last minute. The violence erupted after he recently delegated his vice president to restart negotiations with opponents on the deal. It was considered another stalling tactic by Saleh, and it was followed by a violent crackdown on protesters in Sanaa and other cities. The fighting this week has been centered between the forces of Saleh's son Ahmed and the military units of Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, a longtime ally of the president who defected early on in the uprising and sided with the opposition. Many believe al-Ahmar is himself seeking power and he is distrusted by many in the protest movement who believe he would continue an authoritarian regime similar to Saleh's.","President Ali Abdullah Saleh was injured in rocket attack in June .

Chuck Cox, the father of missing Utah mother Susan Powell, said today that the child pornography charges filed against her father-in-law make it clear he is a liar. Steven Powell, 61, was arrested yesterday after police discovered thousands of images of women and young girls videotaped without their knowledge, including some of his daughter-in-law. Mr Cox said the discovery categorically shows that Powell's claims the 28-year-old mother of two was 'very sexual' with him were lies.

A boy of 11 given a ‘rehabilitation order’ after joining in the riots was caught shoplifting just six days later. The boy, who is thought to be the country’s youngest rioter, stole from a department store in his home town of Romford, Essex, after the windows were smashed. Appearing in court on August 31, the judge told him: ‘You can’t get away with committing offences of this nature.’ The youngster, whose name cannot be made public, was told he would have been jailed if he was ‘a little older’. But six days later, on September 6, he was arrested again in the town’s Asda supermarket accused of theft and assault. Astonishingly, the boy had joined the rioting just five days after yet another court appearance, for arson and criminal damage. When he was placed on the youth rehabilitation order at the end of August, charities criticised the courts for punishing children of his age for ‘minor offences’. But yesterday Tory MP for Romford Andrew Rosindell said the youngster needed a ‘short sharp shock’. ‘We need harsher penalties. You’ve got to make people fear the punishment so they don’t commit the crime,’ he added. ‘What are his parents doing to allow their child to behave in such a way? He needs to be taken away from his parents for six months.’ According to Scotland Yard, the boy is the youngest rioter in London to face prosecution. The original Mail story on Sept 1 . He admitted burglary after he was . caught stealing a £50 waste bin from a Debenhams store on August 8, when . a gang smashed the store windows. Appearing before Havering .

But he was back in the same court on . September 7, where he admitted theft but denied assault. He has been . released on bail until November 22.

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 2:22 AM on 24th September 2011 . The date for the eviction at Europe’s largest illegal traveller camp was becoming increasingly uncertain yesterday as legal challenges began to pile up. Around 400 people on 51 plots at Dale Farm in Crays Hill, Essex, were due to be moved by bailiffs on Monday. But a last-minute injunction was granted by the High Court in London after supporters of the travellers exploited a loophole involving the removal of structures not mentioned in an earlier court order. 'Brightening up the court': The Battle of Basildon continues at the High Court today, where five sisters wore matching floral tops in a 'show of solidarity' Day out: Dale Farm residents pictured leaving their site and making their way to the High Court . Hopeful: Dale Farm travellers Serena (left) and Shannon McCarthy await a court ruling on their eviction . Five sisters who live at Dale Farm . wore identical patterned blouses to show 'solidarity' at yesterday's . hearing and Mr Justice Edwards-Stuart congratulated them for their . 'lovely turnout'. The . Travellers launched a series of extra legal challenges which will . postpone a decision over an eviction to at least next week. The travellers won a last-gasp . injunction on Monday which prevented Basildon Council from clearing the . UK's largest illegal site. The authority was told by Mr Justice . Edwards-Stuart that it had to specify what it wanted to do on each of . the 51 unauthorised plots - which it has now done. Travellers had also launched two . legal actions - relating to questions about whether the council was . acting in accordance with the terms of enforcement notices issued - and, . secondly, calling for a review of the validity of the notices. If the council was successful at today's hearing, clearing of the site could have started as early as tomorrow. But reports from the court at lunch-time suggested a decision would not be made until next week 'at the earliest'. This is because a judge was told more legal challenges were being launched as he considered whether to extend an injunction preventing the council from clearing the site. In addition to today's legal action, it emerged that at least two applications for judicial review were planned as part of the campaign to stop the evictions of travellers. If they go ahead, the applications could add thousands of pounds more to the already huge legal bill generated by the Dale Farm saga. Five sisters who live at Dale Farm donned identical short-sleeved blouses to show 'solidarity' at today's hearing. The McCarthy sisters - Joanna, 38, Tina, 40, Margaret, 46, Kathleen, 50, and Marie, 55 - wore blue and pink floral-patterned tops as they sat in the front row of Court 4. Mr Justice Edwards-Stuart congratulated the 'ladies for their lovely turnout' and added: 'It is very nice to see somebody brightening up the court.' Day out: Residents, including Kathleen McCarthy (centre), pose for the cameras before setting off to hear their fate at the High Court . Nora Sheridan, who lives on Dale Farm, said before the start of today's hearing: 'We're just keeping our fingers crossed - praying for a good result. We don't know what's going to happen.' Bailiffs working for Basildon Council had planned to start the clearance of the six-acre site on Monday, but the operation - which is estimated to be costing more than £1 million per day - was postponed while the legal wrangling was resolved. Council leader Tony Ball said he was frustrated by the delay but added he was convinced the injunction would be overturned once the authority presented the full facts. The clearance of Dale Farm follows a decade-long row over unauthorised pitches. There are 34 legal pitches on the neighbouring Oak Lane site. Taking a stand: Travellers' children pose with their message 'We Love School, We Hate Eviction' after writing it on a blackboard at the entrance to Dale Farm settlemen . Plain talking: The children showed what the move will do to them and show banners protesting at the eviction . Travelling: Wearing more sombre attire, these Dale Farm residents were also pictured leaving their site this morning . Confident: Dale Farm residents flash the 'Victory' sign as they prepare to leave for the High Court . Members of the International Expert Group Meeting on Forced Evictions, meeting at the UN Human Settlements Programme in headquarters in Nairobi, has written to the traveller community of Dale Farm expressing sympathy, it emerged last night. The letter was signed by more than 30 representatives from different countries. It said: 'Repressive policies targeting Gypsies and Travellers disguised as planning regulations are discriminatory, whilst inclusive national strategies that are in line with human rights standards generate real progress in addressing issues of exclusion and marginalisation.' Back at Dale Farm a resident waiting for the court ruling adjusts the aerial on a television . Anxious: Others sit, awaiting any news from London, pouring cups of tea . Lock down: Activists were this morning shutting the barricade of the main gate to Dale Farm . Some travellers had left the site last week in . anticipation of the clearance but have returned this week in the hope . they will be allowed to remain. They upped sticks and set an illegal camp 55 miles away, leading residents to fear that many more were on their way. Around 20 families moved from Essex to Stockwood Park, close to Luton in Bedfordshire, after gaining access to a 100-hectare piece of land. Unlikely friendship: The former bare-knuckle boxer Paddy Doherty, who has struck up a bond with Sally Bercow, wife of the Speaker of the House of Commons, is backing the travellers of Dale Farm . Basildon Council has suggested a variety of temporary flats and houses . over the past six months in an effort to resolve the decade-long . stand-off. But they were turned down for reasons . including because they smelled of smoke or were made of bricks and . mortar, 'contravening' the travellers' desire to spend their life on the . road. Fifty-one plots containing homes . built without planning permission are set to be cleared from the . six-acre site, along with their remaining residents, in an operation . which could cost £18million .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:04 PM on 24th September 2011 . The star of the Yorkie bar TV adverts was yesterday spared jail for killing his wife after a judge noted his ‘praiseworthy’ life. Retired actor Stuart Mungall, 71, smothered 69-year-old Joan Mungall with a pillow in what he said was a mercy killing. He was a devoted carer for his wife of 43 years who was left bedbound and in pain by Pick’s disease, which is like Alzheimer’s. Relief: Stuart Mungall, with an unidentified female, leaves the Old Bailey after being given a 12-month sentence suspended for two years after he pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his ill wife Joan . 'Needed to be put down': Joan Mungall, 69, was suffering from Pick's disease, a rare form of dementia . In July, the prosecution accepted his plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He said the strain of caring for his wife for two years had made him clinically depressed. Mungall, who starred as a trucker in . the chocolate bar commercials during the Seventies, killed his wife on . December 3 last year at their home in Tooting, South London. When police were called, he said: ‘Doctors say do this and that but they cannot make it better, so I made it better.’ Yesterday at the Old Bailey, he . received a 12-month sentence suspended for two years. Judge Peter . Beaumont, the Recorder of London, told him: . ‘You were caring for her most basic . needs with unstinting devotion. You come before the court as a man who . has had a praiseworthy life. ‘You have earned the plaudits of all who have known you.’ He said Mungall’s plea to manslaughter ‘reduces your responsibility but does not extinguish it’. Fame: Mr Mungall played a lorry driver in adverts for Yorkie during the 1970s . Clemency: Mungall, who stared as the original Yorkie chocolate bar adverts, walked free from court today after a judge showed mercy on him . The actor was also placed under . supervision for two years and the judge ordered regular reports so that . any recurrence of his illness could be 'nipped in the bud'. Asked if he understood the sentence, Mungall replied: 'Yes, I do.' His wife, who was also an actress and . had worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company, was left unable to move. Doctors believed she had only months to live and Mungall 'snapped'. The Old Bailey had heard Mungall describe Mrs Mungall as looking into his eyes 'like an animal who needs to be put . down and cannot say it'. Miranda Moore, QC, defending, said Mungall had served the equivalent of six months in custody before being granted bail. She said: 'They were totally devoted to each other. They were each other's lives. 'At the time of her death, she had weeks to live. She was keen to stay in her own home with her husband.' But . in an earlier court appearance the prosecution said the actor should be . jailed, insisting the ill actress had given no indication she wanted to . die and only the day . before her killing had been 'typically upbeat and in a positive mood'. After . police were called to the couple's home on December 3 last year, . Mungall told officers: 'She's not in pain any more. She was in such . pain last night . Outside . court, Mungall's solicitor, Laurence Imrie, said: 'Mr Mungall would like . this opportunity to thank all of those who have provided overwhelming . support during this particularly difficult time. 'He is relieved that this matter has finally been concluded and he respects the court's findings. Pick’s disease is a rare form of dementia that is similar to Alzheimer’s, but which tends to affect only specific areas of the brain. Named after Arnold Pick – a professor from the University of Prague who first described it in 1892 – it causes a slow shrinking of brain cells due to excess protein build-up. Patients initially show marked personality and behavioural changes, and then memory loss and a decline in speech. The disease accounts for just 5 per cent of all progressive dementias. But it is frequently misdiagnosed in the early stages as depression, mental illness, or Alzheimer’s. There is no cure, although antidepressants help manage mood swings, and patients often die within ten years. 'Joan is at peace now and without pain. The family now request that their privacy be respected whilst they continue to grieve.' The Recorder of London, Judge Peter . Beaumont, was told there had been fears that Mungall would take his own . life after being arrested for killing his partner of 40 years. When a doctor was called to their home after he had smothered his wife, the actor was wearing pyjamas and was drunk, saying he had taken pills. He was taken to hospital, where his stomach was pumped, later telling medics: 'I couldn't cope any more. I killed her. The court had earlier heard that Mungall, who . shared a flat with Sean Connery in the 1960s when they were both unknown . actors, met his wife while working for the RSC. They married in 1967. The couple gave up acting to run a . garden centre, but were forced to sell their business in Tooting and a . holiday home in France after Mrs Mungall developed epilepsy in 2008. The following year doctors discovered . she was suffering from a degenerative brain condition, although she was . not diagnosed with Pick's until after her death. The day before she died nurses had found her 'typically upbeat and in a positive mood' during a home visit. Many of the couple's friends – including actress Jane Asher who spoke at Mrs Mungall's funeral – wrote to the judge to ask for clemency.","Strain of caring for sick spouse made Stuart Mungall clinically depressed .

The film star, who played Nelson Mandela in 2009 film Invictus, told CNN the President has become a target for the Tea Party's ‘racist’ aggression. Scroll down for video . Film star: Actor Morgan Freeman claims racism in the U.S. has actually got worse since President Barack Obama took office in January 2009 . Not happy: Mr Freeman, who played Nelson Mandela in Invictus, told Piers Morgan the President has become a target for the Tea Party's 'racist' aggression . He backed President Obama during his election campaign and said the Tea Party’s anti-Obama stance is racist, reported the Huffinton Post. ‘Their stated policy, publicly stated, is to do whatever it takes to see to it that Obama only serves one term,’ he told Piers Morgan on CNN. Is America more racist under Obama? ‘What underlines that? “Screw the country. We're going to do whatever we can to get this black man out of here”.’ Mr Morgan is concerned by the rise of the Tea Party, a right-wing Republican arm that supports presidential candidate Michele Bachmann. ‘It just shows the weak, dark, underside of America,’ he told CNN. ‘We're supposed to be better than that. We really are. Famous appearance: Mr Freeman starred as anti-apartheid South African President Nelson Mandela alongside Matt Damon in 2009 film Invictus .

David Cameron clashed with Radio 4's Today show after his membership of Oxford University's hell-raising Bullington Club was likened to last month's riots . The Prime Minister was asked if there were similarities between being a member of a 'youthful gang that engages in violent behaviour' and looters. He said: 'I think we all do stupid things when we are young and we should learn the lessons.' Mr Cameron attacked  the . BBC for 'making excuses' for rioters as presenter Evan Davis repeatedly questioned him about the drunken antics of the Bullington Club. He asked Mr Cameron: 'Did you witness stuff as a member of that club...people throwing things through windows, smashing up restaurants'? An increasingly irritated PM said: 'No I didn't. But what we saw during the riots was very well organised in many cases looting, stealing and thieving. 'There is a danger that when you listen to the BBC that all these things turn into a great mush and make an excuse for not acting. 'Some people almost say that . until we deal with the problem of inequality in our society, there is . nothing you can do to deal with rioting. ‘That’s what it can slip into, Evan, if you are not careful.’ Mr Cameron believes the riots have underlined the need for tough measures to end the culture of welfare dependency, shake up schools and ensure people understand that they have responsibilities as well as rights. In yesterday’s interview, as Mr Davis suggested the riots might be linked to bank bonuses and the MPs’ expenses scandal, the Prime Minister insisted people had not raided shops because of anger over such issues.

As a fourth night of violence is feared across London tonight, several governments have begun dispensing advice to those thinking about travelling the UK . The United States, Germany, Latvia, Sweden, Denmark and Finland have all urged tourists to be vigilant, keep checking the media for updates and ensure they are insured. On the U.S. Embassy website, travellers are warned to avoid any civil unrest they may see on the streets, and not to engage anyone seen causing a disturbance. Burning down: Several foreign governments have started issuing advice to their citizens thinking about visiting the UK . •    Follow local media reports and be aware of what is going on around you; . •    If you find yourself near any civil unrest, leave; . •    If you see trouble move away from the scene; . •    Don’t engage with those causing disturbance; . •    Do not challenge debate or make unwise comments.  This will only increase your chance of becoming a victim of violence; . •    If you find yourself in trouble and it is an emergency call the police first, only then, if necessary, reach out to the Embassy . Latvia became the first country earlier today to advise its citizens to avoid visiting parts of Britain hit by riots. Its Foreign Ministry in Riga also urged all travellers to Britain to ensure they have health and life insurance policies. Sweden, . Denmark and Finland quickly followed its lead by issuing safety advice . to stay vigilant and keep an eye on local media and British websites for . safety updates. Embassy's alert: The website of the U.S. embassy is London now includes tips on how to stay safe . Embarrassing: The Portuguese Jornal de Noticias . (left) and the Belgian De Standaard (right) both put photographs of the . London riots on their front pages . Headline news: Dutch newspaper Het Parool (left) and the Argentinian paper Clarín (right) both led on the London riots . The Finnish Embassy warned that moving from one place to another in problem areas can be 'extremely difficult'. The German foreign ministry also issued travel advice by warning its citizens to exercise 'special caution' in the wake of the troubles. It told travellers to immediately 'pull back' if confronted with any signs of disturbance, and to especially follow advice given by security forces. Its travel advisory stated: 'Travellers should also look to the media to keep themselves informed about the latest developments and act in an appropriate fashion locally.' Foreign news: Spanish newspaper El País (left) and Austrian newspaper Voralberger Nachrichten (right) have both published in-depth coverage of the riots . In India, the editor of the country's Lonely Planet magazine told his Twitter followers to avoid coming to the UK at all. Vardhan Kondvikar said: 'Violence has now spread to Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester and Liverpool. 'Try not to travel to the UK this week if possible.' Foreign newspapers have splashed images of burnt out cars, looters and embattled police on their front pages. Journalists from near and far have been following the riots, in particular the German media which has highlighted the fact that London is just one year away from hosting the Olympics. 'London burns - but the fears are concentrated on the Olympics instead of de-escalation,' said Sueedeutsche Zeitung. 'Chaos reigns in London!' added de Bild, while a commentator on Bavaria Radio said: 'It will be hard to sell London as a civilised upholder of Olympic values and spirit while the buildings burn brighter than the Olympic torch and the stone-throwers beat out the discus and javelin competitors with ease.' The TZ newspaper in Munich added: 'What has gone wrong with Britain? Like the Sex Pistols said, it truly is anarchy in the UK. Now the fight is on to find the solution - and fast.' The reaction from the U.S. has been mixed, but broadly in favour of a tougher response. On arts and culture website The Atlantic, David Blum wrote: 'They enacted a slash spending program nine months ago, it destroyed growth, and people are rioting. There's no surprise here. You destroy the economy and bad things happens.' Warning: The editor of India's Lonely Planet magazine Vardhan Kondvikar told his Twitter followers to avoid coming to the UK at all . But elsewhere, commenting on the Wall Street Journal website, Steven Hoskins was not so sympathetic and wrote: 'They riot because they are criminals. No excuses accepted. 'These people are welcome to march and protest, but when they start robbing and destroying other's property, then I'm all for declaring them targets for target practice.' Another poster on the Washington Post website added: 'Send in the military with orders to shoot all looters.

Riot police fired tear gas at thousands of Greek protesters today as they took to the streets to protests against the Government's austerity measures. Ahead of a keynote speech by the Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, more than 17,000 angry citizens were dispersed by officers in the city of Thessaloniki. Police said that they came under attack from protesters using flare guns, stones, sticks and even a petrol bomb, and they arrested two people while detaining another 100. Two people were injured. Riots: Protests by anti-austerity protesters on the streets of Greece's second city lasted long into the night as thousands took to the streets to protest against the Government . Taking cover: A pair of riot police use their shields to protect themselves from rocks being thrown by this masked man in central Thessaloniki . Burning: A group of riot police stand guard after the protesters set fire to objects in the streets . In Athens, police fired stun grenades to . disperse around 400 protesters who tried to block a main road outside . Parliament. The protesters retaliated with firebombs that they lobbed at . officers over passing traffic. They were protesting against Mr Papandreou's Socialist government's austerity measures which include cutting pensions and salaries while raising . taxes and retirement ages. Speaking this evening, Mr Papandreou promised to meet ambitious fiscal targets for 2011 and save the debt-crippled country from bankruptcy. He also pledged to press on with vital reforms to improve fiscal discipline and secure continued payment of international rescue loans. Weapons: Police said that the groups used flare guns, stones, sticks and even a petrol bomb to attack them . Kicking off: A man lashes out with his feet at a group of riot officers . In a nationally televised address he said: 'We will push through all the major changes our country has needed for years. 'And we will take whatever other decisions are needed, we will do whatever is necessary to keep the country on its feet.' Papandreou added that his main concern was to keep the country solvent. 'We don't have the right to abandon this effort halfway through,' he said. 'Because if it remains half-done, (our) sacrifices will have been in vain.' Manhandled: This female protester is led away by a riot officer, while another uses her hands to slap this officer who is guarding the front of a shop . Arrested: A man is dragged away by five riot officers, one of 94 people reportedly detained by officers .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:39 PM on 23rd September 2011 . Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas says he has asked the United Nations to admit the state of Palestine as a full member. The move defies U.S.-led international pressure on Mr Abbas to abandon such a bid. In response, Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu said: 'I extend my hand to the Palestinian people,' adding that he wanted a 'just and lasting peace' with Palestine . However, Mr Netanyahu has opposed the bid for statehood at the UN general assembly in New York. Determined: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, left, and Israel's Binyamin Netanyahu both addressed the UN General Assembly in New York today . Mr Abbas is sidestepping nearly two decades of troubled negotiations in the hope this dramatic move on the world stage will re-energise Palestine's quest for an independent homeland. He was greeted by sustained applause and appreciative whistles as he started to deliver a speech outlining his country's aspiration of becoming a full member of the United Nations. However, some members of the Israeli delegation, including Foreign Minister Avigdor Liebermann, left the hall as Abbas approached the podium. Negotiations with Israel 'will be meaningless' as long as it continues building on lands the Palestinians claim for their state, Mr Abbas declared, warning that his government could collapse if the construction persists. 'This policy is responsible for the continued failure of the successive international attempts to salvage the peace process,' said the president, who has refused to negotiate until the construction stops. 'This settlement policy threatens to also undermine the structure of the Palestinian National Authority and even end its existence.' To another round of applause, he held up a copy of the formal membership application and said he had asked UN chief Ban Ki-moon to speed up consideration of his request to have the United Nations recognise a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. He concluded his speech by saying, 'We have one goal: to be. And we shall be.' President Barack Obama and Mr Abbas are seen during a meeting in New York on Wednesday . Mr Abbas' jubilant mood was matched by the exuberant celebration of thousands of Palestinians who thronged around outdoor screens in town squares across the West Bank on Friday to see their president submit his historic request for recognition of a state of Palestine. 'I am with the president,' said Muayad Taha, a 36-year-old physician, who brought his two children, ages 7 and 10, to witness the moment. 'After the failure of all other methods we reached a stage of desperation. 'This is a good attempt to put the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian people on the map. Everyone is here to stand behind the leadership.' Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, addressing the General Assembly shortly after Abbas, said his country was 'willing to make painful compromises.' 'I extend my hand to the Palestinian people, with whom we seek a just and lasting peace,' he said, to extended applause. Palestinians, he added, 'should live in a free state of their own, but they should be ready for compromise' and 'start taking Israel's security concerns seriously.' Mr Netanyahu offered to meet Mr Abbas in the Palestinian city of Ramallah, but added that he would be willing to meet for talks in New York tonight. He said: 'Who's there to stop us? What is there to stop us? I'll tell you my needs and concerns, you'll tell me yours. And with God's help we'll find the common ground of peace.' Even if the UN recognises Palestine, . there will be few immediate changes on the ground: Israel will continue . to occupy the West Bank and east Jerusalem and to restrict access to . Gaza, ruled by Hamas militants. Security Council action on the membership request could take weeks or months. The strategy has put the . Palestinians in direct confrontation with the U.S., which has threatened . to veto their membership bid in the Council, saying that statehood can . only be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties to end . the long and bloody conflict. 'Deeply confrontational': Tony Blair has today cautioned against Palestinian statehood . By seeking approval at a world forum . overwhelmingly sympathetic to their quest, Palestinians hope to make it . harder for Israel to resist global pressure to negotiate the borders of a . future Palestine based on lines Israel held before capturing the West . Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza in 1967. The U.S. and Israel have been . pressuring Council members to either vote against the plan or abstain . when it comes up for a vote. The vote would require the support of nine . of the Council's 15 members to pass, but even if the Palestinians could secure that backing, the U.S. says it will veto the move. The resumption of talks seems an . elusive goal, with both sides digging in to positions that have tripped . up negotiations for years. Israel has warned that the Palestinian appeal to the UN will have a disastrous effect on negotiations. Talks broke down nearly three years ago after Israel went to war in the . Gaza Strip. A last round was launched a year ago, but broke down just . three weeks later. The UN recognition bid has won Mr . Abbas broad popular support at home, but it is opposed by his main . political rival, the Islamic militant Hamas movement that wrested . control of Gaza in 2007. Gaza's Hamas prime minister, Ismail . Haniyeh, said: 'The Palestinian people do not beg the world for a state, . and the state can't be created through decisions and initiatives. 'States liberate their land first and then the political body can be established.' The . plea came as former Prime Minister Tony Blair warned that the move will . be 'deeply confrontational' without a return to peace talks with the . Israelis. The former . prime minister, now Middle East representative for the international . community, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that UN recognition would not . change conditions on the ground in the Occupied Territories. He . stressed that he was not trying to block the application for Palestine . to be recognised as a state and said its leaders were 'entirely entitled . to do so'. But he went on: . 'You can pass whatever resolution you like at the United Nations or the . Security Council, it doesn't actually deliver you a state on the ground . in the West Bank and Gaza, and if you don't have a negotiation, . whatever you do at the UN is going to be deeply confrontational.' Violence: A Palestinian holds a slingshot as others roll tires to burn during clashes with Israeli soldiers, at the Qalandia checkpoint between the West Bank city of Ramallah and Jerusalem . Religious unrest: Palestinian demonstrators carry a slingshot and rocks past a burning rubbish bin during clashes with Israeli soldiers today . The . issue has divided the international community, with Israel and the U.S. strongly opposed and France trying to seek a compromise. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has admitted to 'debates' at the top of government about how Britain should respond. Mr Blair, special envoy for the U.S., . UN, EU and Russia Quartet, said he was working day and night to find a . way of relaunching negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. He suggested Mr Abbas . did not need the statehood recognition to hold talks with Israel. 'When you actually get down to the . detail of territory, security, Jerusalem, refugees, water, all the . issues, to be absolutely frank about it, it doesn't make a great deal of . difference whether you are designating someone as a state or not a . state,' he said. 'The Palestinian Authority and President Abbas are perfectly able to negotiate with the Israelis.' He added: 'With the changes going on . in the region at the moment, there is a huge strategic interest on both . sides to get a credible negotiation going again.' U.S. President Barack Obama has also . pleaded with Mr Abbas to drop the application in case it causes further . violence in the region.","Israeli leader offers to meet Palestine's president for talks in New York tonight .

"By . Rick Dewsbury . Last updated at 12:43 AM on 15th September 2011 . Relaxed: Lord Hanningfield outside his home earlier this week before being rearrested . Expenses cheat Lord Hanningfield was arrested yesterday – just days after being released from jail. The former Tory peer, who was imprisoned for falsely claiming more than £13,000, was questioned over allegations that he had also put in fraudulent claims while leader of Essex County Council. The politician, who was born  Paul White, has been released on bail until January 18 ‘pending further inquiries’. A spokesman for Essex police said: ‘A 70-year-old man from the Chelmsford area has been arrested... for fraud as part of an investigation into expenses claims.’ Lord Hanningfield, a former pig farmer, was freed from prison last week after serving just a quarter of his nine-month sentence. He was a former frontbench opposition spokesperson and leader of Essex County Council and was jailed in July this year after a jury at Chelmsford crown court found him guilty of £13,379-worth of expenses fraud. He claimed parliamentary travel expenses to London when Essex county council was already paying for him to be chaffeur-driven to the capital. He was found guilty of six counts of false accounting which included falsely claiming for overnight hotel accommodation when he was actually sleeping at his home 50 miles away. Justice Saunders branded the lord a 'benefits cheat' when he sentenced him. Hanningfield then lost an appeal against his conviction in July when judges said his case was 'unarguable'. But he was freed earlier this week after serving only nine weeks of a nine month sentence. The former peer was pictured earlier this week walking his dog in his home village of . West Hanningfield, Essex. He looked relaxed and refused to admit any wrongdoing. ‘I have been out of prison for a few days and I was treated very well,’ he said. Claims: Lord .

Lord Taylor of Warwick, who was jailed in May for 12 months after fiddling £11,000 of taxpayers' money, is also out on early release. Taylor celebrated his freedom by visiting his local beauty salon for an hour in Ealing, west London. It is not known what treatment the peer enjoyed, but massage and holistic therapies are its specialty. Both men were expelled from the Conservative party but they remain members of the House of Lords – enabling them to start claiming more expenses. It is understood they were released separately last week on a home detention curfew which deems them low risk and forces them to wear an electronic tag.","Lord Hanningfield served only a quarter of nine-month sentence for fiddling parliamentary expenses .

Next time you cook some bacon in your kitchen, just think about the journey it might have been on before ending up on the frying pan. A ‘well-organised’ pig theft operation may be why more than 1,000 hogs have been stolen from Midwest farms in the past few weeks, officials say. Many thefts are happening at large animal confinement operations in Iowa and Minnesota, with pigs hauled off by the hundreds in trucks. Missing: A 'well-organised' pig theft operation may be why more than 1,000 hogs have been stolen from Midwest farms in the past few weeks (file picture) Such thefts in huge numbers are fairly rare - but the pigs are probably being sold to slaughterhouses as prices have increased in the last year. At least 700 hogs have been stolen recently from facilities in Nicollet and Kandiyohi County in Minnesota, officials said. In Mitchell County, Iowa, around 200 hogs have been stolen from farms. But no arrests have yet been made and no stolen pigs have been found. Officials say they believe thefts in their own states are linked, but have not determined if the thefts in Minnesota and Iowa are connected. The buildings where the hogs are kept at large animal confinement operations generally have side curtains raised and lowered for ventilation. The thieves can gain entry by cutting through those and through netting that keeps birds out, investigators say. Stolen: Many thefts are happening at large animal confinement operations in Iowa and Minnesota, with pigs hauled off by the hundreds in trucks (file picture) The facilities involved also are in isolated locations. ‘Not many people drive by and this time . of year they're surrounded by corn,’ said Nicollet County sheriff's . investigator Marc Chadderdon. Nicollet County, Minnesota: 150 hogs worth $30,000 . Kandiyohi County, Minnesota: 560 hogs worth $100,000 . Mitchell County, Iowa: 200 hogs worth $10,000 . TOTAL: 910 hogs worth $140,000 . He said it's not unusual for trucks to pull up to the facilities at all hours of the day and night to deliver feed or collect hogs ready for slaughter. The thieves in Minnesota seem to be targeting specific facilities based on their location and the type of hogs they have, he added. Mr Chadderdon said the thieves appear to be conducting surveillance first. The hogs stolen in Minnesota were all market ready at around 250lbs. ‘They wanted ones ready to be sold,’ Mr Chadderdon said. ‘There is a higher profit margin if you don't have to feed them.’ About 150 hogs, valued at about $30,000, were taken from Nicollet County - and 560 hogs were taken from Kandiyohi County, valued at $100,000. Expensive: Such thefts in huge numbers are fairly rare - but the pigs are probably being sold to slaughterhouses as hog prices have increased (file picture) This time last year their hogs were selling for around $125 - but their market price has gone up to around $200, reported CNN. 'If you're taking 500 of them, it's quite an operation - you're not going to do that by yourself. I've . been here 17 years and we've had a couple or a half dozen stolen but . nothing of this volume and not of this sophistication' Marc Chadderdon, Nicollet County sheriff's investigator . ‘If you're taking 500 of them, it's quite an operation - you're not going to do that by yourself,’ Mr Chadderdon said. ‘I've been here 17 years and we've had a couple or a half dozen stolen but nothing of this volume and not of this sophistication.’ Mitchell County Sheriff Curt Younker said three farms operated by Iowa Select Farms were broken into in recent weeks. None of the buildings were locked, he said. In addition, one or two individual farmers also reported hogs stolen, the sheriff said. He said most stolen hogs go directly to a processor who deals with the same people most of the time. The animals taken from Mitchell were younger hogs that weigh around 50lbs, valued at about $50 per head - with an estimated loss of $10,000.","Pigs stolen from U.S. animal confinement operations .

A combative Barack Obama last night stepped up his fight for presidential re-election, claiming the U.S. would be ‘fundamentally crippled’ if the Republicans got into power. The President, speaking at an $18,000-per-person fundraiser in Medina, Washington, is desperate to renew the enthusiasm of Democratic loyalists who are growing more disenchanted with him daily. He told around 65 guests at an intimate brunch that he is tired of a ‘constant ideological pushback’ from the GOP ‘against any kind of sensible reforms’ to help improve the economy and job market. All smiles: A combative President Barack Obama, pictured on Sunday, stepped up his fight for presidential re-election, claiming the U.S. would be 'fundamentally crippled' if the Republicans got into power . President Obama, 50, was speaking on Sunday at the home of former Microsoft executive Jon Shirley on the liberal West Coast, for the first of seven fundraisers he is holding over a three-day period. He was also due to take in Hollywood and San Diego in California, as well as Denver, Colorado, in a series of events to help him re-engage with some of his most liberal and deep-pocketed supporters. The trip comes as an under-fire President Obama has shifted from concentrating on compromise with Republicans on Capitol Hill to calling out GOP House Speaker John Boehner and others by name. He has criticised them as obstructionists while demanding their help in passing his $447billion jobs bill. His revamped approach is a relief to Democratic activists who want to see a stronger President. They are fed up by what they view as the President's conceding of ground to the GOP on tax cuts and other issues while the economy has stalled and unemployment is stuck above nine per cent. President Obama said 2012 would be an especially tough election because people are discouraged and disillusioned with government, but he also said he was determined because so much is at stake. Say cheese: President Barack Obama greets supporters at a Democratic party fundraiser in Seattle, Washington, while he is in the West Coast for Democratic party fundraisers . ‘(The GOP alternative is) an approach to government that will fundamentally cripple America in meeting the challenges of the 21st century,’ President Obama said. '(The GOP alternative is) an approach . to government that will fundamentally cripple America in meeting the . challenges of the 21st century. And that's not the kind of society that I want to leave to Malia and Sasha' President Barack Obama . ‘And that's not the kind of society that I want to leave to (my daughters) Malia and Sasha.' President Obama got a friendly welcome from invited guests at his first stop. But liberal activists later greeted the president with a demonstration. ‘We want to see Obama stand up as strongly as he can to fight for the people of this country who are working out there to make ends meet,’ said Kathy Cummings, of the Washington State Labor Council. The group helped organise a demonstration outside Seattle's Paramount Theater, the site of a fundraiser with about 1,800 guests. Activists held signs and urged President Obama to: ‘Tax the rich.’ President Obama and the GOP presidential candidates are working to raise campaign cash ahead of an important end-of-month reporting deadline that will give a snapshot of their financial strength. Big job: Democratic activists are fed up by what they view as the President's ceding of ground to the GOP on tax cuts and other issues while the economy has stalled and unemployment is stuck high . President Obama's West Coast visit was heavy on fundraisers - two each in Seattle and the San Francisco area Sunday, followed by one in San Diego on Monday and two in Los Angeles. 'We want to see Obama stand up as . strongly as he can to fight for the people of this country who are . working out there to make ends meet' Kathy CummingsWashington State Labor Council . He is meeting with the Silicon Valley and Hollywood elite, including an event on Sunday night in Atherton, California, at the home of Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg. The expected haul from all seven events is $4 million or more. In addition to the fundraising, President Obama scheduled a town hall-style event Monday in Silicon Valley, hosted by social networking company LinkedIn. The trip ends on Tuesday with a speech to supporters in Denver, where he accepted the Democratic nomination three years ago. President Obama was pushing throughout for his job proposal, which combines tax cuts, unemployment benefits and public works spending. Running: President Obama jogs over to greets well-wishers upon arrival by plane in Seattle on Sunday . The bill faces a hostile reception on Capitol Hill, particularly because President Obama wants to pay for it with tax increases opposed by Republicans. A top aide said the White House expects a vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate next month. 'We wish that his fighting spirit had been there a few months ago, but it's here now' Rick Jacobs, Courage Campaign . Despite deep reservations even from some in the President's own party, ‘I think it's got a very good chance’ of passing, David Plouffe told ABC. If he can't persuade Congress to pass the bill, President Obama has said he wants to make sure the public knows who's standing in the way. Jobs are a major concern in California, where unemployment stands at 12.1 per cent - the highest of any state except Nevada. Mark DiCamillo, director of California's Field Poll, said that has contributed to a softening of support for President Obama among Democratic and independent voters. Hello there: President Obama greets young well-wishers upon arrival at King County International Airport . President Obama's job approval rating dropped to 46 per cent among Californians in a Field Poll this month. Among Democrats it was 69 per cent, but that was down 10 percentage points from June. ‘Californians voted for him by 24 points . in 2008 and the Democrats and non-partisans were the backbone of his . support and he's losing some of that now,’ Mr DiCamillo said. 'Californians voted for him by 24 points in 2008 and the Democrats and non-partisans were the backbone of his support and he's losing some of that now. They're looking for Obama to do something' Mark DiCamillo, California's Field Poll . ‘They're looking for Obama to do something.’ Unfortunately for the President, the summer's nasty debate over raising the government's borrowing limit turned off voters. Many liberals bemoaned the deal that cleared the way for a higher debt ceiling, with President Obama agreeing to Republican demands for steep budget cuts without new taxes. But Democratic supporters are heartened by the jobs plan and President Obama's insistence that Congress must raise taxes to pay for it. Now they are hoping that the confrontational Obama they are seeing now is the same one they will see through the 2012 campaign. Rick Jacobs, head of the Courage Campaign, a progressive online organizing network in California, said: ‘We wish that his fighting spirit had been there a few months ago, but it's here now.’","Barack Obama speaks at $35,800-per-couple fundraiser in Washington state .

President Bush was joined by former president Bill Clinton as the pair paid silent tribute to the victims of September 11  at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania the day before the official anniversary of the terror attacks. Mr Bush said the defiance of passengers aboard the doomed plane were a shining example of democracy in action.

Current vice president Joe Biden joined the former presidents, families of the victims and several hundred others -- many in patriotic T-shirts or holding US flags -- under a slate grey sky. During the ceremony, the names of the 40 victims were read out, one by one, accompanied by chimes. On Sunday, President Barack Obama is to join a two-hour commemorative service at the spot where Flight 93 went down -- lifting the profile of a sometimes overlooked episode of the catastrophic 9/11 attacks.

Award-winning bagpiper Bruce Liberati performed, as did Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan. In the aftermath of 9/11, local volunteers took on the task of greeting visitors and maintaining a makeshift memorial along the chain-link fence that overlooks what some call 'America's first battlefield against terrorism'.

Relatives shed some tears, but they also celebrated the spirit of the guestbook - a rare feeling that people from vastly different walks of life had come together. 'I don't focus on what happened. You can't change that,' said Lorne Lyles, whose wife, CeeCee Ross Lyles, had been working as a United Airlines flight attendant for only nine months on that September morning in 2001.

You really do have some caring people in the world.' Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar spoke at the site on Friday. He noted that for all the progress on the memorial, there's still work to be done. When it is finished, it will include a Tower of Voices with 40 wind chimes. Public and private donors have contributed $52 million, but $10 million more is needed to build a true visitors centre and to finish landscaping, Mr Salazar said. 'We will not be able to complete the site' without additional funding', he said.","George Bush laid a wreath at a special ceremony at the Pentagon this morning .

Whilst the ongoing conflict in Libyan continues in a bid to reclaim the entire North African country from ousted Moammar Gaddafi, new evidence has been uncovered detailing the special 'privileges' Britain bestowed on the former leader's deceased son Captain Khamis al Qadhafi. In documents uncovered by the Sunday Telegraph, the clear courting of Khamis includes SAS training for his regiment, courses at Sandhurst and taxpayer-funded invitations to British events including accommodation in five-star London hotels. Khamis was Gaddafi's fifth son, who having graduated from the Libyan Military Academy in 2002, then spent an additional year in Russia at the Frunze Military Academy. Having returned to his homeland, he established the 32nd Brigade, that were given an insight into British operations when 50 Libyans including members of Khamis' squad were given SAS training in counter-terrorism, weapons and field craft. This knowledge was later used by the Brigade to a devastating effect during their retaliation for the uprising against his father. When the conflict reached Tripoli in August, Khamis' Brigade clashed with rebel forces and carried out a brutal execution of a reported 45 prisioners at a warehouse. Escapee, Abdulrahim Ibrahim Bashir told of the horror. He said: 'Four soldiers climbed on the top of the warehouse, and another soldier opened the door. They started shooting at us . 'The guy at the door was throwing in grenades. After I escaped, I saw one of the soldiers finish off anyone who was wounded.' It was widely accepted that Gaddafi's . 10,000 unit was better equipped than the country's army but their . overriding responsibility was for the safety and welfare of the entire . family. A Libyan man covers his face with the charred skeletons of some 50 people found in a makeshift prison following an execution carried out by Khamis' troops . Following the completion of the deal in principle to release the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, Khamis' unit signed a £85 million agreement with General Dynamics UK in 2007. This provided the Libyans with a similar command and control system to that used by the British Army. And with the relationship blossoming, clearance in 2009 allowed for 50 Libyan troops from the Brigade to undergo SAS training. A fighter from Libya's ruling National Transitional Council fires an RPG rocket at pro-Gaddafi forces . Anti-Gaddafi fighters fire a heavy artillery piece near Sirte . Documents dating back to 2008, . addressed, 'Restricted - UK/Libya Eyes only,' reveal that whilst the SAS . course was 'regrettably' inaccessible for foreign parties, just months . later, the permission to educate Khamis' men was given. Former commanding officer to Tony . Blair, Robin Searby, defended the education received by the Brigade . insisting: 'There was no need for the British Government not to be . involved with Libya at the time, as it was felt that it was better to . have them inside the tent rather than outside.' In letters from Khamis' elder brother . Saif, enquiring into the training, it reveals the difficult 'selection' course endured by the Libyans during their stay at the training base. Searby reinforced this belief by adding that the soliders 'were no up to it' following their special programme. However relations between both British . and Libyan parties began to deteriorate following a request from the . Campaign Against Arms Trade to name all the overseas delegates, which . was rejected by Libyan officials. Libyan rebel fighters celebrate as they drive through Tripoli near to where Khamis was later reportedly killed . A letter sent by Defence and Security . representative, Graham Innett pleaded with the Libyans for reasons . behind their denial of the names. He . wrote: 'If you are not content, I would ask that you provide me with a . formal statement with the reasons, as this will help strengthen the case . against release.' Khamis and his aides believed the release would severely threaten his ability to conduct future deals as the conflict in the Arab country spiralled. Having fled Tripoli, he is alleged to have been killed during a rebel ambush south of the capital. However, the same British troops that once assisted him and his fellow compatriots were now fighting against him in a bid to end his father's last remaining foothold on the Arab nation.","Loyal Gaddafi gunmen attack rebel forces in Tripoli .

The 'fantasy' portrayal of Edwardian country house life in Dowton Abbey is 'b*******, basically,' said the historian and broadcaster A.N. Wilson yesterday. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the outspoken historian took aim at the smash hit period drama, dubbing it a 'sanitised version of the past'. 'I don't want to be too serious about it, but the idea that Downton Abbey represents this country's finest hour is b*******, basically,' Mr Wilson said. 'B*******, basically': The verdict passed by historian A.N Wilson, left, on Downton Abbey, written by Julian Fellowes, right . He apologised for his colourful use of language immediately, but added that the Downton Abbey world, created by Julian Fellowes, though 'harmless fun' was far removed from reality. 'Julian Fellowes has claimed that Downton Abbey - which is sheer fantasy and a sanitised version of the past - is realistic and that we ought to go back to the old days,' he said. 'I'm not being po-faced about it, but a programme that depicted the real lives of servants would have been an interesting one. 'It's worth emphasising how dirty and how smelly life was for almost everybody before about 1950.' Downton Abbey is a period drama set in the early 20th century in an English country house. A new series of the programme is set to begin tomorrow. Huge success: Most of the nation will be gripped by the impending new series of Downton Abbey . It was the second time this week Mr Wilson has turned his guns on Mr Fellowes, after he accused the Dowton creator of having a 'childish, snobbish mindset' in an article for the Daily Mail. In the article, published on Wednesday, he accused Fellowes's Downton Abbey of glorifying 'an ordering of society that was hateful in real life.' 'Fellowes would like to promote the idea that ill-considered costume dramas such as Downton Abbey are only a bit of fun,' wrote Mr Wilson. 'But I find the widespread taste for it dismaying because it gives me the impression that the great British public have learned no lessons about the iniquity of class prejudice in the past 100 years.'","A.N.

A spokesman for the community confirmed that they would 'resist the bailiffs and build barricades' in a bid to remain on the six acre plot.

Resident Kathleen MCarthy said today: 'We will resist but none of us have weapons or anything like that. 'We have gas canisters but they are for fuel and will absolutely not be used as weapons.'

Swedish Marxists and German campaigners, as well as British university students, are among those who have drifted in to the six-acre site, where about 400 of the 1,000 residents have been ordered to leave.

One supporter, who gave her name as Marina, revealed that specialists in peaceful resistance had already joined the group and were holding training sessions to show the travellers how to combat the eviction using peaceful methods. To do list: The travellers make a final note of what's to be done around the site . About 80 newcomers are understood to have presented themselves at a makeshift headquarters and scores more are expected to join them over the weekend. Tents providing temporary shelter and large gazebos for communal meals have sprung up. Police fear up to 2,000 people from 30 groups are planning to try to block the eviction, despite having no direct link to the site. Officers believe they could use the confrontation as an excuse for politically motivated violence. Aerial photos taken yesterday showed the occupants are turning the camp into a fortress, with watchtowers, barbed wire and hay bales and tyres that can be set alight. High-pressure canisters that can be detonated have also been stockpiled. One activist, who declined to be named, said: ‘We will take whatever action is necessary to stop innocent people being left homeless. ‘They’re not hurting anyone. We have chains and padlocks to lock ourselves to the concrete blocks. Children will form part of the human barricade.’ Another, who covered his face with a hood and jumper, added: ‘There is no way we are leaving them (the travellers) here to be attacked by the thugs who pass themselves off as bailiffs. Yes, we are preparing for battle and want here to be our fortress. ‘What other option have these people been left with? A life in supermarket car parks is no future for these good people.’ In a sign that the operation is being . taken over by outside elements, one traveller described a meeting . yesterday between the two groups, saying: ‘They (the anarchists) were . telling us what to do. They seem to know exactly how to handle the . situation. ‘They were saying there was still plenty of time to prepare and reinforcements are on their way.’ Another . said: ‘A lot of us accept we will have to move on and won’t put up much . resistance, although there’s plenty who want to fight to the end.

'It’s . the people who’ve been turning up over the past few days who really want . to square up to the authorities.’ The evictions of 80 families living on . 52 plots are set to begin within a fortnight, ending a ten-year legal . battle. The travellers’ application for a High Court injunction to delay . the evictions failed on Wednesday. A . local homeowner, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ‘There is genuine . terror about what is to come. The misery and fear we have had for years . could be nothing by comparison. 'The . fact that children could be used to make the police operation more . difficult shows the depths that these people are prepared to stoop to. It’s the sort of thing a demented despot would do.’ The . travellers were moving valuables including TVs from the area in transit . vans yesterday to minimise the damage to their property when the . confrontation begins. An Essex Police spokesman said that if any children took part in the protests, ‘social services would be involved’. John Baron, the MP for Basildon and Billericay, appealed for the travellers to leave peacefully. He said: ‘The law must be enforced . equally and fairly, otherwise we discriminate against the law-abiding . majority. No one group or individual can be above the law.’ Flying the flag: MPs and the local council have pleaded with those on the camp to leave without causing trouble .

"Last updated at 11:55 AM on 29th September 2011 . Stark warning: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Barnanke speaking at the Ideas For Tomorrow session in Ohio . Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said long-term unemployment was an American 'national crisis' and urged the U.S. government to take further action to combat it. Mr Bernanke, who also said the government should provide more help to the battered housing industry, noted that about 45 per cent of the unemployed had been out of work for at least six months. In a question-and-answer session after a speech in Cleveland, Ohio, he said: 'This is unheard of. This has never happened in the post-war period in the United States. They are losing the skills they had, they are losing their connections, their attachment to the labour force. 'The unemployment situation we have, the job situation, is really a national crisis.' Mr Bernanke said the government needed to provide support to help the long-term unemployed retrain for jobs and find work, and he suggested that Congress should take more responsibility. He said long-term unemployment, budgetary discipline and housing policy were the three most important areas where Congress could contribute to an economic recovery. He added: 'There are certainly some areas where other policymakers could contribute.' His comments were his latest in a public effort to make Congress act further to rejuvenate the economy. Unemployment line: Crowds of people waiting to enter a job fair at Crenshaw Christian Center in South Los Angeles . Nationwide concern: Similar crowds turn out for a job fair in Oregon. Mr Bernanke says that the government and Congress have a larger role to play . He suggested that the Federal Reserve could achieve only so much through policies that seek to lower long-term interest rates. He said: 'The Federal Reserve has made enormous efforts to try to help this economy recover and stabilise.' This was done through its control of interest rates, or monetary policy. He said: 'Monetary policy can do a lot, but monetary policy is not a panacea.' On the housing crisis, Mr Bernanke said strong government programmes to help the industry recover would help the Federal Reserve's own efforts to boost housing by driving mortgage rates to their lowest levels in decades. Unemployment: A July-to-July graph shows America's shaky recovery . In his speech, Mr Bernanke said the U.S. and other rich nations could relearn a few lessons from fast-growing developing nations. He said the successful emerging economies such as China had adopted disciplined budget policies, embraced freed trade, made public investments and supported education. But in the Q&A period, Mr Bernanke warned U.S. politicians against cutting deficits too quickly to reduce budget debt. He has said that could put the fragile economy at risk. He noted in his speech that emerging markets such as China accounted for a large and growing share of the global economy, so they needed to act accordingly. He said: 'With increasing size and influence comes greater responsibility.' Mr Bernanke added that emerging nations would be challenged in the future by their reliance on exports to drive growth. The Obama administration has been pushing the Group of 20 major economies to boost domestic demand rather than relying so heavily on exports to rich nations.","45% of unemployed out of work for at least six months .

Police led to a shallow grave by cadaver dogs in the hunt for missing Utah mother Susan Powell called off the search after they found charred wood that may have been used to burn human remains. At the spot just 30 miles from where Susan's husband Josh said he took their children on the night she disappeared that police had been digging through, they found about 100 pieces of wood which had traces of human decomposition on them. Police said they believe it may have been the site of a crime scene once and were unable to say if the remains belonged to the missing mother-of-two. Disappearance: Susan Cox Powell, a mother of two young children, was reported missing on December 7, 2009, when she was aged 28 . West Valley City Lt Bill Merritt said: 'There’s a very good possibility that this at one point . or another was a crime scene. Whether it’s linked to ours, we . don’t know.' The dogs picked up a scent in the desert . two days ago and they have been digging at the spot since. They then . found the shallow grave. A state anthropologist - an expert on . digging up human remains - was brought in to help serach the spot but . police are confident that they won't find any more and have stopped . excavation. A forensic specialist will now examine the wood. 'We are very disappointed, we are frustrated,' Lt . Merritt told The Salt Lake Tribune of Saturday’s outcome after days of effort at the dig site. 'We were . hoping that this would be the answer everyone was looking for.' Susan Powell disappeared from her . West Valley City home on 7 December, 2009. Her husband is the only named . person of interest in the case but has never been charged or arrested. He said he took his young sons, then . four and two, camping on the freezing winter night around 12.30am. He . believes his wife ran off with another man. Cadaver dogs led police to the . grave site on Wednesday just off a dirt road near the base of Topaz . Mountain, a popular rock-hounding spot in remote central Utah. They claimed to have found human remains but later said it was a false alarm. Family: Susan Powell is pictured with her two young sons and husband Josh, who went camping in freezing temperatures with the boys in December 2009 . Susan Powell's father, Chuck Cox, said he had long-believed the search for his daughter would be a lengthy process. 'There's no real false hope, it's . just another step in the investigation,' he told Fox. 'Every day is hard . for the family. Life goes on, and so you go on the best you can. It's . something you have to live with.' ‘It's a game of patience at this . point,’ a local police spokesman said. ‘We need to slow down a little . bit and identify what it is we found.’ Mrs Powell, then 28, went missing after failing . to show up for her stockbroker job. She was seen by friends at church . and dinner the day before. Concerns: Josh Powell, husband of Mrs Powell, is under a cloud of suspicion in her disappearance as he is the only person of interest in the case . Last month investigators searched mine shaft-dotted mountains near Ely, Nevada. 'I'm sure there are people who have died in the desert that nobody knows about'Chuck Cox, father of Susan Powell . In addition, West Valley City police served a search warrant on the Puyallup, Washington, home Mr Powell shares with his father. They seized computers and journals thought to have belonged to her. Mr Powell said he will not be commenting on the body’s discovery. This latest search is in an area popular for gem and rock hunters. Police have said Mrs Powell's husband liked to rock hunt in the area. Mrs Powell's father, Chuck Cox, said he is not sure the remains are his daughter’s - as the search area is a very deserted place. Looking: Officials search in the area of Topaz Mountain in Juab County, Utah, for signs of mother Mrs Powell, who has been missing since 2009 . ‘I'm sure there are people who have died in the desert that nobody knows about,’ he told NBC. 'It's gone from just bizarre to just unbearable for the family' Anne Bremner, lawyer for Mrs Powell's family and Chuck Cox . The case has caused a major feud . between the Cox and Powell families - with the latter claiming Mrs . Powell ran off with another man, reported MSNBC. Steve . Powell, Mr Powell’s father, sensationally claimed last month he had a . flirtatious relationship with his daughter-in-law and they were in love. But . this was denied by her parents and Cox family lawyer Anne Bremner, who . claimed the Powells had gone from ‘bizarre to just unbearable’. Mrs .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 8:02 AM on 26th September 2011 . 'Poor reception': Andrew Partridge felled 11 of his neighbour's trees and damaged another 21 . A fuming neighbour was so annoyed about the poor signal his television was receiving that he cut down the trees he thought were responsible for it. Andrew Partridge felled 11 of his neighbour's trees and damaged another 21 near his house because he thought they were interfering with his channel reception. The 30-foot high Scots pine trees he cut down were growing on agricultural land backing on to his home and he has now been ordered by a court to pay the landowner £2,500 in compensation. However this figure could rise again if civil action is taken against 55-year-old Partridge to recoup more of the £17,000 of damage he caused to the trees. Partridge was also given 80 hours community service at Norwich Crown Court. The court heard that Partridge had been warned several times in the past to stop cutting back the trees - which he ignored - and was even personally asked by the landowner Julian Taylor, whose farm backs on to Partridge's house. Mr Taylor, a seventh-generation arable farmer in Starston, Norfolk, said after the hearing that it will take between 15 and 20 years to repair the damage caused to the belt of mature trees. He also suggested he might pursue a civil claim against Partridge. He said: 'The compensation covers some of the damage but not the loss of amenity. We will have to go back to our lawyers and see if it is worth chasing. 'We would like to get on and replant this autumn so the screen has a chance of growing back as quickly as possible.' Destroyed: The 30-foot high Scots pine trees were growing on agricultural land backing on to Partridge's home. It could take between 15 and 20 years to repair the damage, which has cost more than £17,000 . Partridge, of Harleston, Norfolk, told the court - via his solicitors - that he felled the trees to help his neighbours. Despite the court hearing how the total damage was more than £17,500, Partridge, who used to be a HGV driver, was only ordered to pay £2,500 and given the community sentence, as he is out-of-work and has no assets. Judge Alasdair Darroch said: 'That may still happen to you. You had no right to do what you did.' The judge also told him he should not have denied the criminal damage charge, adding: 'It was a great pity you . chose to defend this action. You had absolutely no defence and no . business to cut down the trees.' Partridge made no comment after the case. Mr Taylor said he had noticed branches on his belt of mature trees were gradually being cut down, but he had no idea who it was until he spotted Partridge in 2009. He also said he believed Partridge's motives were to create a view from his property. He told the BBC: 'He made some lame excuse that he needed to improve his television reception. 'The fact was he was clearing the branches from the ground up to about 25ft, which was really, I think, so that he could get a view out to the west.' Mr Taylor, who is also vice-chairman of the Royal Norfolk Agricultural Association, said he hoped the case would serve as a warning to . He added: 'If he had stopped the first time or even the second time I asked, we wouldn't have asked for a prosecution to take place.' Mr Taylor, a farmer and vice-chairman of the Royal Norfolk Agricultural Association, said he hoped the sentence would send out a warning to others in the same situation.","Andrew Partridge caused more than £17,000 of damage .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:50 PM on 14th September 2011 . Police officers involved in the stand-off with Raoul Moat revealed today that Taser rounds fired at the cornered killer had 'no effect whatsoever'. Gunman Moat was shot at twice with experimental Tasers by officers after he prepared to kill himself - with one round missing and the other striking him but having 'no effect'. The wanted murderer had held a shotgun to his head and told police negotiators 'this is all going to end in this field tonight' shortly before he was fired at by officers using experimental X-12 shotgun Tasers. Armed police, including one with a controversial Taser, are seen attempting to negotiate with Raoul Moat who shot himself in the head after a six-hour stand off . A jury at Moat's inquest heard the two West Yorkshire firearms officers - identified in court as Zulu 24 and Victor 24 - had received no formal training to use the weapons and had never fired an X-Rep projectile before. Moat had shot and injured his ex-girlfriend Sam Stobbart, killed her new boyfriend Chris Brown and the next day blinded PC David Rathband last July. He evaded a huge police manhunt for days until he was cornered in on a grassy area by the River Coquet in Rothbury, Northumberland. The inquest is now trying to determine the sequence of events that led to Moat's death, and the revelation that the killer was Tasered just before his gun went off may establish a link between the two events. During the stand-off, negotiators developed a good rapport with Moat, Zulu 24 told the jury at Newcastle Crown Court. The man who declared war on police even told them where he had hidden a gun in woods as he did not want a child to find it, the officer said. But the tone of negotiations became 'sinister' and the officer said: 'Moat went on to say he didn't want to be a drain on society, that he didn't want to go to jail, and one particular thing he did say was it was all going to end in this field tonight.' Moat shuffled his feet, and in a swift movement brought the gun from under his chin and pointed it at his temple, the officer said. Deadly weapon: This is the shotgun Moat used to take his own life, pictured for the first time today . Arsenal: Police issue weapons shown as part of the Raoul Moat inquest . 'I thought he was going to shoot himself.' Zulu 24, who was aiming an X12 shotgun at Moat's chest, fired. He said: 'Moat let out a noise as if he had been struck by something. He has then rocked back slowly and then discharged the shotgun. 'I was aware my round had struck him. I don't think it had any effect.' He said when he fired an X26 handgun-style Taser previously, it had made a loud, crackling noise, but that did not happen with the X12. Coroner David Mitford asked: 'Was there any effect on Mr Moat?'

Police officers photographed negotiating with fugitive Raoul Moat, circled, shortly before his death in Rothbury, Northumberland . The witness replied: 'None whatsoever, sir.' A sergeant identified only as Tango 21 told the court he heard the 'pop' of a Taser from the police line to his left hand side, then 'a second or two' later saw the X12 armed officer beside him fire his Taser. Moat's body was pulled clear of the grass by police officers and paramedics. The officer said: 'He had blood splattered across his face. His eyes were open but his eyeballs had rolled back. 'My overriding feeling was one of sadness that because of Moat's actions we had not been able to bring him to justice and bring him to court for what he was suspected of.' He said each of the two firearms officers had fired their X12 Taser once. He was asked whether being hit by a Taser round could have caused Moat to shoot himself by accident as a result of his muscles contracting on the shotgun trigger. He said there was 'a clear pause' between the sound of the Taser shots and Moat flinching and the gunman shooting himself. Moat, left, killed his love rival Chris . Brown, 29, in Birtley, Gateshead, in July last year, then blasted his . ex-lover Samantha Stobbart, 22, right, leaving her in a critical condition . The second officer to fire an X12 at Moat missed, the inquest heard. The officer, identified as Victor 24, discharged his Taser shotgun with no effect on his target. He said Moat's conversation had become more 'sinister', then he became silent as if gathering his thoughts. 'My honest belief is that he was about to commit suicide,' the firearms officer said. Victor 24 aimed his X12 at Moat and heard a nearby colleague fire a cartridge at the ex-doorman. The officer said Moat, who was sitting down with his sawn-off shotgun at his temple, shrieked, rocked back then righted himself. Victor 24 realised his colleague's Taser had not incapacitated Moat so he fired. The officer did not see where his projectile went and accepted the cartridge was later recovered from the river. Almost immediately after he fired, there was then a 'muffled bang' from Moat's direction, he said. The killer went limp and fell backwards.

Moat, left, killed his love rival Chris Brown, 29, in Birtley, Gateshead, in July last year, then blasted his ex-lover Samantha Stobbart, 22, leaving her in a critical condition. The officer in charge of the police operation has previously defended the use of the experimental Tasers, claiming it gave them the 'one chance' to bring him in alive. Police feared the gunman intended to end his rampage of violence by attacking marksmen and committing 'suicide by cop' so breached the police's code of practice, the inquest was told last week. Northumbria Police Assistant Chief Constable Steve Ashman was offered the use of the non-lethal X-Rep Taser shotguns on the day detectives discovered Moat intended to kill innocent members of the public. The weapons were used during the stand-off on the riverbank, when Moat shot himself using a sawn off shotgun as officers pointed guns and Tasers at him.

X-Rep Tasers fire a cartridge for 30 metres, whereas standard police Tasers have a range of just seven metres. Mr Ashman said he had to balance breaking the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) code of conduct, which forbade the use of non-approved weapons, with Moat's right to life under Article 2 of the Human Rights Act. He said the decision to use the guns meant 'the buck stopped with him'. Mr Ashman, who led Operation Bulwark, the mission to find and capture the fugitive, said he wanted to bring in Moat alive to face justice. He said: 'We had reached the stage where there did not appear to be many alternatives. 'I was constantly having to reassess and re-evaluate my position; to stop us from sliding into a plan which had only one outcome. 'Moat had to face justice for what he had done but I also had a duty to protect his life. 'An opportunity had been presented to me, one I had not thought of but one which I was duty bound to examine because it gave us possibly the only chance, possibly one chance and one chance only, a single chance to apprehend him without using lethal force, without shooting and killing him.' Mr Ashman said anyone going within seven metres of a killer armed with a loaded shotgun would be 'foolish'. But he said that as well as being a breach of the Acpo code, he knew the use of the X-rep carried a risk, one of which was that he had 'no idea' of what the physiological impact would be. He said: 'This was a situation that was in extremis, at the far end of the scale in terms of the threat that he presented and with that I was duty bound to consider all the options available to me to achieve the objective. There was nothing else.' The inquest continues.","One Taser shot fired at Moat missed, one 'failed to incapacitate' killer .

"By . Tim Shipman . Last updated at 10:28 AM on 27th September 2011 . Ed Balls insisted Labour was not ‘profligate’ with taxpayers’ money yesterday – while demanding £44billion of extra government spending. The Shadow Chancellor suggested Britain should immediately pump nearly £23billion of public cash into the economy to kickstart the recovery. And he said Labour opposes a further £21billion of cuts the Government is already making. Mr Balls sought to win back authority for Labour on the economy by saying he would submit to ‘iron discipline’ on spending if the party gained  power again. Speech: Ed Balls, pictured addressing the Labour conference in Liverpool, has set out a five-point plan for economic growth . But he was accused of having ‘zero credibility’ because he flatly refused to apologise for Labour’s wasteful use of public cash, which left Britain vulnerable before the financial crash. Opponents also pointed out that he could make all the extravagant claims he wants because, with an election up to four years away, they will never be tested. ‘Don’t let anyone tell you that Labour in government was profligate with public money,’ he told the party conference in Liverpool. And later at a fringe meeting, he said he has no intention of apologising for Labour’s public spending record. ‘I don’t believe in a mea culpa strategy,’ he said. ‘The Tories would like nothing better . than for me to say that public spending caused the crisis but it’s just . not true. I think politically it would be very foolish.’ In his first speech to conference as Shadow Chancellor, he set out a five-point plan to kick-start the flagging economy. He called for an immediate one-year cut in VAT to 5 per cent on home improvements, repairs and maintenance. The Treasury said that would cost £2.2billion – four times Mr Balls’s estimate of £500million. He also demanded a one-year National . Insurance tax break for every small firm which takes on extra workers – a . fresh cost of £900million. Ovation: Mr Balls is congratulated by Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman after his speech . Leadership: Ms Harman, Mr Balls and Mr Miliband at the side of the stage . Eastern European workers should face restrictions on their movement to prevent big business benefiting from ‘cheap labour’ at the expense of British workers, one of Ed Miliband’s closest advisers said yesterday. Lord Glasman, a personal friend of the Labour leader, also said Spanish trawlers should be restricted from fishing in British waters. In a Eurosceptic-tinged intervention at the party conference, the peer launched a stinging attack on New Labour, saying it had built a strong economy before the recession on the back of cheap labour from abroad. Lord Glasman called on Mr Miliband to challenge the EU on its doctrine of free movement of labour. ‘The idea that workers in Poland are working in an equivalent economic space to workers here is just not true,’ he said. ‘Wages are far, far lower there so the incentives to move and come where wages are higher – that disrupts family life, that disrupts economic growth in Poland and creates a dependent culture. I think we should have a treaty change to stop it. The idea that treaties cannot be negotiated is anti-political.’ At another fringe meeting, former Communities Secretary Hazel Blears admitted that under Labour, ‘immigration was too high, too fast; communities changed before people’s eyes and put strain on public services’. She added: ‘This is how people feel. It’s almost like we’re frightened to say it. I think we got this sense that we have got this great melting pot which is London and some of our big cities. But that’s not necessarily reflected in other communities. ‘We can’t have a party that’s simply London-centric that looks through the prism of a very multi-cultural community but also a very middle-class community. That isn’t the reality for very many people out there.’ MP Margaret Hodge said mass immigration was here to stay and politicians are ‘lying’ if they claim they will slash it. She said all parties should stop ‘competing on numbers’ and instead focus on tackling feelings that the system is unfair. She insisted the Government’s vow to cut net immigration to the tens of thousands ‘will fail’. Mr Balls said Labour would reverse January’s rise in VAT – costing £12.1billion – and bring forward capital investment projects at a likely cost of £8billion. ‘Call it Plan A-plus. Call it Plan B. Call it Plan C. I don’t care want they call it – Britain just needs a plan that works,’ he said. His aides claimed the proposals would be financed by slowing the speed of deficit reduction – condemning Britain to years more with the national credit card in arrears. Mr Balls admitted that if Labour won power in 2015 he would not be able to reverse all the Coalition’s austerity measures. But he condemned cuts to the police, child benefit, tax credits, pensions, the axing of the Future Jobs Fund and regional development agencies. Without those savings, government borrowing would be £21billion higher than now – bringing the black hole in Labour’s plans to a staggering £44billion. Mr Balls acknowledged that there was no area in which it was more important for Labour to win the public’s trust than on the economy. With the world facing ‘the darkest, most dangerous times for the global economy in my lifetime’, Britain is threatened with ‘a lost decade of economic stagnation’ if growth is not revived, he warned. The Conservative programme of deep and swift cuts is ‘not working’ and risks plunging the world into a 1930s-style depression, he added. Mr Balls claimed Labour bequeathed the Coalition a golden economic inheritance. In fact total debt rose between 1997 and 2010 from a little under £350billion to more than £550billion. The highly respected Institute of Fiscal Studies has concluded: ‘On the eve of the financial crisis, the UK had one of the largest structural budget deficits among either the G7 or the OECD countries.’ And both Tony Blair and former Chancellor Alistair Darling have  admitted that Labour was spending too much. Mr Balls sought to curry favour with voters by admitting Labour made mistakes on bank regulation, the 10p tax rate, Gordon Brown’s paltry 75p pension rise and on immigration from Eastern Europe. But he also resorted to a crude class-war attack on David Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson, saying those with ‘independent means’ did not care about those suffering in the downturn. Justine Greening, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘This speech failed the credibility test. Everyone can see that Ed Balls is dangerously addicted to debt. A teenage schoolboy became the star of the Labour Party Conference and was hailed as ‘brilliant’ after a rousing speech in which he ripped into the 'vicious' Coalition. In echoes of a teenage William Hague addressing the Tory conference in 1977, Rory Weal received a standing ovation from thousands of delegates and had Ed Miliband rushing to shake his hand. Rory, 16, who lives with his mother Elaine and eight-year-old sister Emma in Maidstone, Kent, had the week off school to attend the conference.He became involved with politics after his family home was repossessed as his mother struggled to find work. Red Rory: 16-year-old Rory Weal from Maidstone addresses the Labour Party conference . He told thousands of activists: ‘Two-and-a-half years ago, the home I had lived in since birth was repossessed. ‘I owe my entire well-being and that of my family to the welfare state. That is why I joined the Labour Party. ‘That very same welfare state is being ruthlessly ripped apart by a vicious, Right-wing, Tory-led Government. ‘I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for that system, that safety net. So I take this opportunity to plead with the Government to reconsider their measures. ‘Their measures for young people, which will divide a generation and seriously threaten the British promise that Ed Miliband has spoken about, where one generation does better than the last. 'Their measures on welfare, such as the housing benefit cap, which will potentially make 40,000 people homeless and hammer the most vulnerable people in society.’ His impassioned plea was hailed as 'brilliant' by Ed Balls.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:55 PM on 25th July 2011 . Alive: Arthur Gerald Jones, 72, disappeared more than three decades ago . A former Chicago commodities broker . who disappeared in 1979 and was declared legally dead has been found . living under a false name and working at a casino in Las Vegas. Arthur Gerald Jones, a husband and father of three, was reported missing May 11, 1979, and declared dead by an Illinois court in 1986. FBI agents had investigated his disappearance as suspicious and focused on possible mob connections, but they never solved the missing persons case, according to an affidavit filed earlier this week. Jones, 72, was arrested Tuesday . on four felony counts related to identity theft and fraud after . officials say he renewed his Nevada driver's license in 2008 under his . assumed name, Joseph Richard Sandelli. Authorities say before Jones . disappeared, he paid a friend in Chicago $800 for fake documents and a . Social Security number belonging to another man. Jones' lawyer, Stephen Stein, . said the Nevada attorney general's office is offering his client a plea . deal that would allow him to plead guilty on one of the charges and face . probation. Jones posted bail on Thursday and has not yet discussed the . plea deal with Stein. He is set for an August 23 court hearing. Hideout: Jones settled in Las Vegas in 1988, where he worked for the Rampart Casino's Sports Book . A criminal complaint filed Monday . in Las Vegas Justice Court paints the picture of a powerful Chicago . financier tormented by snowballing gambling debts. Jones told investigators he held a . seat with the Chicago Board of Trade and lived with his wife, Joanne . Esplin, and three young children in Highland Park, Illinois. But Jones said he was forced to sell his board seat to pay debts, according to the affidavit. Esplin said her husband forged . her name to get a second mortgage on the couple's home and pay personal . gambling debts, the document alleged. She said she suspected he was . delivering money or running errands for the Chicago mob. His marriage troubled and . finances in shambles, Jones told investigators he decided to leave to . get a 'fresh start,' the affidavit said. Esplin and Jones had been married . 17 years when he disappeared. According to the affidavit, Esplin told . investigators the last time she saw her husband - whose gambling once . led him to bet $30,000 on a basketball game - was May 11, 1979, when he . left to run an errand. She said he looked very nervous at the time. Jones never spoke to his family . or friends again. Presuming he had died, Social Security paid his family . $47,000 in survivor benefits, the document said. Attempts to contact Esplin were unsuccessful on Friday. Earlier this month, investigators . from the Social Security Administration contacted Nevada DMV officials. They were investigating Jones for using the Social Security number of a . man named Clifton Goodenough, according to the affidavit. Investigators say Jones used his . Joseph Sandelli alias to get a Nevada driver's license when he moved to . Nevada in 1988, and renewed it in 2008. Authorities say he also lived in . Florida and California after leaving Chicago. According to investigators, he moved he settled in Las Vegas in 1988, where he worked for the Rampart Casino's Sports Book. Stein said his client has friends in Las Vegas who 'consider him family' and who sprang to his defence after the arrest. DMV spokesman Kevin Malone said . cases like Jones' are turning up more frequently as computer databases . improve and law enforcement agencies are better able to communicate . among themselves. 'Technology is catching up,' he said. The Social Security Administration is continuing its investigation.","Arthur Gerald Jones 'tormented by gambling debts'

"After speculation all weekend workers find out in ten minute meeting this morning . David Davis: 'They are an outstanding workforce and worth fighting for' Alan Johnson: 'It is terrible news delivered in a terrible way' Majority of jobs belonged to highly-skilled workers . By . Simon Duke . Last updated at 4:49 PM on 27th September 2011 . Politicians and union bosses united today to condemn the treatment of the 3,000 BAE staff who lost their jobs as 'a disgrace'. After days of speculation in the media, staff were finally informed of the job losses this morning in a ten-minute meeting with senior management. The biggest job cuts will be at sites in Warton and Samlesbury in Lancashire and at Brough in East Yorkshire. Losses: Tory MP David Davis speaks outside BAE in Brough, East Yorkshire as two workers leave the plant after being told by management 3,000 jobs are to go . Speaking outside the BAE plant in . Brough where 900 people lost their jobs, former home secretary Alan . Johnson, who is Labour MP for West Hull and Hessle, said: 'They have had . terrible news, delivered in the most terrible way.' Standing . beside him, Tory MP David Davis added: 'They are an outstanding . workforce - low cost, efficient and worth fighting for.' Both politicians expressed their dismay that the majority of jobs that were lost belonged to highly-skilled engineers. Speaking outside the BAE plant in . Brough where 900 people lost their jobs, former home secretary Alan . Johnson, who is Labour MP for West Hull and Hessle, said: 'They have had . terrible news, delivered in the most terrible way.' Standing . beside him, Tory MP David Davis added: 'They are an outstanding . workforce - low cost, efficient and worth fighting for.' United we stand: Former home secretary Alan Johnson (left) and Tory MP David Davis condemn BAE's decision to axe 3,000 jobs across the UK . Both politicians expressed their dismay that the majority of jobs that were lost belonged to highly-skilled engineers. Explaining the firm's decision Ian King, chief executive of BAE . Systems, said the company needed to maintain its 'competitiveness'. Mr King said: 'Our customers are facing huge pressures on their defence . budgets and affordability has become an increasing priority. 'Our . business needs to rise to this challenge to maintain its competitiveness . and ensure its long-term future.' But union chief Brendan Barber branded the decision 'yet another devastating body blow to our manufacturing base'. Phil McCarthy of the GMB union added that it . was a ‘disgrace’ that staff had found out about the cuts through media . leaks over the weekend rather than from the company. BAE was known to be planning to axe . jobs in the UK as cuts to defence budgets hit sales of the Eurofighter . Typhoon combat jet, which is currently in action over Libya with the . Royal Air Force. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told BBC Breakfast that the job losses were 'devastating'. She said: 'This is high-skilled jobs in Yorkshire and Lancashire. I think people will be very worried about this news. 'I . think what this really shows is the irresponsibility of having the . scale of public sector cuts that we have been seeing at a time when the . private sector is just not growing. BAE has cut jobs across the UK but the greatest losses have been felt at three plants: . Brough plant (899 jobs lost) - Home of the Hawk Jet Trainer (pictured). There are 900 of these low-cost combat aircraft in use. It is the most sucessful training aircraft in the world and is used by the RAF and airforces in India, South Africa, Canada, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. - 'And so you haven't got a whole series of private sector jobs, high-skilled jobs across the North for people to go into if they lose their jobs at BAE. 'So I think the Government does really need to respond to this and say what they are going to do about it.' Ian Waddell of the Unite union said: . ‘These job losses will be a hammer blow to the UK defence industry, . which is already reeling with the consequences  of the Government’s 'buy . off the shelf' policy.’ He called on the Government to offer . immediate support to BAE Systems to keep its order book strong and avert . heavy job losses. Labour defence spokesman Jim Murphy said the news was . ‘a real knock for UK manufacturing’. He added: ‘At a time when it is so hard to find a new job, this is a dreadful moment to lose the one you have. ‘The defence industry is vital to the UK, supporting both our forces on the front line and the wider UK economy.’ BAE has a 33 per cent stake in the . Eurofighter joint venture company – alongside EADS and Finmeccanica – and has received orders for 550 planes from Britain, Germany, Italy . and Spain, the four partner countries involved in the project. The company announced a round of job cuts in January after issuing a £410million profits warning. Despite efforts to maintain staff, BAE has not been able to make up for all the sharp defence budget cuts. Last year it announced 1,400 job . losses as a result of the cancellation of the Nimrod search and rescue . aircraft contract and the scrapping of Harrier jump jets. In July, BAE reported a 12 per cent . drop in pre-tax profits to £691 million for the six months to the end of . June and it predicted that sales would fall again in the second half of . the year. Grounded: BAE was known to be planning to axe jobs in the UK as cuts to defence budgets hit sales of the Eurofighter Typhoon combat jet . The savage cuts have not just affected . BAE’s British business. About half the company’s sales are in America, . which has also been hit by defence spending cuts. BAE executives fear there is no end in sight to the squeeze on Government defence spending. And there is always a chance that some . huge orders such as the £6billion contract for two aircraft carriers, . which are not due to be completed until the end of the decade, could . still be cancelled.","After speculation all weekend workers find out in ten minute meeting this morning .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:57 PM on 25th September 2011 . A British schoolgirl has become one of the youngest drag racers in the world - just a day after turning eight. Petite Belle Wheeler, whose favourite colours are pink and purple, qualified for today's UK National Finals less than 24 hours after taking her drag racing driving test. She will be competing against youngsters more than twice her age. Need for speed: Belle Wheeler, pictured with her 15ft dragster, cruised through her driving test a day after turning eight . She is still nine years away from the UK's road-driving age limit, but in the meantime the tiny blonde can speed down tracks as the minimum legal age to get behind the wheel is eight. Her 15-foot dragster, which was made in America, has been specially adapted for her small 4ft 4in frame and can accelerate to 50mph in just 12 seconds. Until she turned eight, she had never driven a dragster, but after just an hour's tuition she sped through her test. 'It was amazing to get in the car and drive it all on my own,' said Belle, who has to wear specially made fireproof overalls when she races. 'I was really scared because at the end of the track you have to turn a corner and if you go too fast the car can tip over. 'It was quite hard to steer at first and keep the dragster going straight, but I soon got used to it. 'I love going really fast and all my friends are very jealous. They can't believe I get to go racing.' Belle is following in the footsteps of older sister Paige, who began racing 18 months ago when she was 11. 'I love going really fast': Belle's car, which can accelerate to 50mph in 12 seconds, has been adapted so her tiny legs can reach the pedals . The girls, who also enjoy cheerleading, became interested in the high-speed motor sport three years ago when the family moved to Wellingborough in Northamptonshire - just 10 minutes drive from the famous Santa Pod track. The family went to a fireworks display at the track, but it was the racing the girls enjoyed and soon they were dragging their dad Andy there every weekend to watch. Andy and his wife Dionne, 32, bought Paige a second-hand car on her 11th birthday and months later she won the FIA European Finals Event.  Now Belle hopes she will be equally successful. Pint-sized racer: Belle brings her dragster back to the pits at the Santa Pod track in Northamptonshire . 'I don't know where the girls get it from as no one else in the family races and until now I haven't been into it,' said Andy, 38, a senior manager. 'I never dreamed that with two young girls I would be spending my weekends at the race track. 'It is not what I expected them to be interested in, but they are obsessed by the sport so I want to support them. 'Belle has been looking forward to this moment for the last 18 months and recently she's been sitting in her car and we've been pushing her around. 'I am worried about them racing such fast cars, but we reluctantly agreed for Paige to do it so we've got to give Belle a chance too. 'It is nerve-racking to watch them and doesn't get any easier.' Belle is using Paige's old car, which has been specially adapted so her legs can reach the pedals. Rising star: Belle was due to compete in the UK National Finals today at the Santa Pod raceway against competitors twice her age . She had to do three observed runs in front of race directors at Santa Pod in order to pass her driving test and get her licence. 'Belle has been helping to clean Paige's car and checking the tyre-pressure, so she couldn't wait to actually get in and drive it,' added Andy. 'I took her go-karting last week to get used to the steering, but she had never actually driven a dragster before. 'Her reaction time was 0.02 seconds which would put her in the top five in a competition.' Amazingly Belle succeeded in qualifying for the UK National Finals, which are being held today at Santa Pod. Race officials said she was the youngest ever junior dragster to compete in a UK national event. After the race the girls will put away their cars until the season begins again next March. Next year they plan to compete in the UK, Sweden, Germany and the USA, which will cost around £25,000, including travel. The family hopes sponsorship deals will cover around £15,000 of this. 'They are very lucky girls. My first car cost £250 and I had to save for three years to buy it,' said Andy.","Belle Wheeler cruised through drag racing driving test after just an hour's tuition .

"Syringe and blood-smeared latex glove found near 31-year-old's corpse . Family tried to prevent autopsy as 'dissection' would violate religious beliefs . By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 1:11 PM on 26th September 2011 . The discovery of a doctor's body in a locked bathroom at the hospital where he worked has turned into a possible murder inquiry. The body of anaesthetist Dr Karim Aly, 31, was found at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales, on August 23 along with a syringe and a blood-smeared latex glove. Police who investigated at the time did not believe it to be foul play as there was no signs of a struggle. The body of anaesthetist Dr Karim Aly, 31, was found at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales, on August 23 along with a syringe and a blood-smeared latex glove. However in his native Egypt there have been claims in the media, as well as on a government website, that he was murdered. Local coroner Peter Maddox subsequently ordered an autopsy but it has been condemned by Dr Aly's family who said 'dissecting' his body would violate his and their beliefs and 'strike at the heart of their religious identity'. The controversy came to light during a legal challenge to prevent the autopsy at the High Court in London last week. The judge Mr Justice Silber ruled that an invasive autopsy was the only way of finding out if there was 'third party involvement' in the Egyptian's death. His sister Dr Sarah Aly initially supported the claim he has been murdered but later withdrew the accusation saying she was grief-stricken when she made it 'in the heat of the moment'. She argued that 'cutting' the body would cause the family enormous distress and less intrusive toxicology tests, along with MRI scanning of his corpse, would be enough to dispel any suspicion that the doctor had been strangled. Dr Sarah Aly said her family now believed there was nothing suspicious about the death and they should be allowed to have the body repatriated intact to Egypt. Her barrister, Chris Williams, said an autopsy would breach the 'fundamental tenets' of the family's faith and amount to a violation of human rights to respect for family life and freedom of religion. Can Yeginsu, for the coroner, said suspicions raised by the Egyptian media, and initially by Dr Sarah Aly herself, meant a thorough investigation had to be carried out. Neither toxicology testing nor MRI scanning would rule out foul play, Mr Yeginsu told the judge. He said other patients at the Welsh hospital might object to being scanned by a machine that had been used on a dead body. Mr Yeginsu added that if the equipment were used on Dr Aly 'it would be very much a first, not only in Wales but probably in the United Kingdom'. The coroner had also received firm . advice that MRI scanning could not detect 'subtle pathology, such as . pressure to the neck' and 'wouldn't be sufficient to rule out third . party involvement'. Local . experience of using MRI equipment to scan dead bodies was 'non-existent' and such techniques would not uncover 'subtle injuries that are found . in some kinds of homicide'. Mr Justice Silber said the police investigation was prompted by Dr Sarah Aly's initial 'very serious allegations to the effect that the deceased had been murdered' and the stories circulating in the Egyptian press. Mr Justice Silber also said that although toxicology tests on Dr Aly's blood and urine might be effective in detecting the presence of any drugs, they would not reveal whether they were 'administered by a third party' or whether force was used. With Dr Aly's body deteriorating, it was concluded that an invasive autopsy was the only viable means of investigation. The coroner told the High Court that he had 'real regret' that an autopsy would entail 'further upset' to Dr Aly's family. Mr Justice Silber also expressed his 'great sympathy' for the loss of a young man at the start of his medical career.","Syringe and blood-smeared latex glove found near 31-year-old's corpse .

"By . Martin Robinson and Jessica Satherley . Last updated at 4:11 PM on 27th September 2011 . The eight children kidnapped from foster care by their biological parents have been found by NYPD’s regional fugitive task force. Shanel Nadal, 28, and Nephra Payne, 34, have been taken into custody by police, while their children have been placed with the Harrisburg Administration for Children’s Services in Pennsylvania. The children, who were taken during a supervised visit last week, were found safe and ‘in good condition’ in Harrisburg, police said in a statement. Found safe: The seven sons, all named Nephra, and 11-month-old daughter Neferiti (pictured) have been found by NYPD's regional fugitive task force in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania . The seven sons aged between four and 11, all called Nephra, and the 11-month-old daughter, Neferiti, were originally placed in a foster care facility in Queens, New York, following allegations of abuse. The New York mother is believed to have revealed her plan in a text message the day before the abduction. Lower Manhattan resident Shanel was on an supervised visit with her children last Monday when she snatched her seven boys and daughter Nefertiti. Amieka Smith, who cares for two of Nadal's kids, told the New York Daily News that she received a disturbing text from her before they vanished. Hunt: Parents Nephra Payne, left, and Shanel Nadal, right, were on the run after snatching their eight children from foster care . 'I cannot live without my children. I cannot breathe without my children,' Nadal wrote. The children had been taken away from Nadal and their father Nephra Payne, 34, after a domestic abuse incident, and were placed in three separate foster homes. Police said last week that Mr Payne may have had a hand in the abduction. Ms Smith said Nadal was desperate to be with her children, and felt her 'back was against the wall.' She told the News: 'She isn't a monster. She just loves her kids. I cannot say I'm surprised she tried.' The snatch happened at the Forestdale Child Agency in Forest Hills, Queens, where the children, were sneaked out into a black vehicle and driven away at high speed. 'Everybody is shocked, nobody expected this,' one of the children’s foster parents said today. Police were not sure of the vehicle's model but think it could have been a 1996 Chevrolet Suburban, a 2003 Ford Sedan or a 1993 Infiniti. Found: The eight children, seven called Nephra and the other called Nefertiti, had been fostered to three different familes . People involved with the children since they were taken into care expressed their concern at the abduction. Corey King, 31, whose sister Linda Mitchell has fostered five of the boys, told the News that he and his sister were devastated. 'These kids were taken away from their parents for domestic abuse,' he said. 'We are worried for their safety. We are afraid they might get hurt.' The children have lived with him and his sister in their Queens home for three years. 'They came to us with emotional scars, but they are good kids,' he said. 'They just need a good home. They are used to us now.'","The siblings were snatched from a foster care facility in Queens, New York, and found in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:10 AM on 27th September 2011 . Confusion: Harriet Harman, pictured during her speech at the Labour conference, made an embarrassing radio gaffe today . Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman appeared to back defeated Miliband brother David for prime minister today in an embarrassing slip during a radio interview. She immediately corrected herself and said she hoped that Ed Miliband, who beat elder brother David to the leadership, would spend 10 years at Number 10. The mistake comes as the two brothers are still under intense scrutiny for any signs of rivalry or ill-feeling after last year's bruising leadership contest. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour whether she thought Labour would have a female leader within the next decade, Ms Harman said: 'Well I hope we can get David...' Cutting herself off as she began to say 'elected', she paused briefly before going on: 'I hope we will get Ed Miliband elected as prime minister for the next election and then he will be 10 years as Prime Minister, so not in the next 10 years, no.' Despite having the most support among MPs, MEPs and rank-and-file party members, David lost the election to succeed Gordon Brown after his younger brother swept up votes among the unions. Until then, Ed had always been junior to his elder brother in the Labour hierarchy. At this year's party conference David has attended only one event, and he will be in the U.S. while Ed makes his leadership speech tomorrow. Spot the difference: Ms Harman confused Labour leader Ed, right, with his elder brother David . While setting out the case for the Labour leader and deputy leader duo always to include a woman, Ms Harman said she wanted the top role to be occupied by the present leader for the next decade. 'I want our current leader to succeed and he's a man,' she said. Asked who she thought might be Labour's first woman leader, she refused to say. 'It's like asking a woman, ""Who is going to be your second husband?"" If you are still on your first you don't want to discuss the second one,' Ms Harman said. 'It's just not a conversation you can have.'","'I hope we will get David - er, Ed Miliband elected as Prime Minister', she tells Woman's Hour ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:26 AM on 29th June 2011 . The High Street took a battering yesterday as a host of retailers announced they will be closing stores and with 10,000 jobs facing the axe. Chocolate chain Thorntons said 120 poorly performing shops face the closure while Britain’s biggest floor coverings firm, Carpetright, announced plans to shut 75 outlets, placing up to 200 jobs at risk. The clothing chain TJ Hughes – a Liverpool institution – said it is looking to appoint an administrator, placing 4,000 full and part time jobs in jeopardy at its 57 stores nationwide. Chocolate chain Thornton's said 120 poorly performing shops face the axe . Jane Norman, the women’s fashion chain which called in the administrators at the start of the week, announced 33 stores will shut as it made 400 staff redundant. The gloomy news will transform the fabric of the High Street, as well-known names pull down the shutters on their stores. Retailers are falling victim to plunging consumer confidence across the country. At the tills this translates into hard-up shoppers preserving their cash for all but the most essential of items. It comes as new figures released . yesterday showed a big slump in household savings in the first three . months of the year as families struggle to keep up with rising prices. Jane Norman closed it's doors on Saturday before it was put into administration today . The Office of National Statistics yesterday said stagnant wages meant the savings ratio - . the money they have left to tuck away after paying bills - fell from . 5.1 per cent to 4.6 per cent over the three months to March. At the same time, households - while paying more - are actually buying fewer goods and services. The amount bought . in those months fell by 0.6 per cent - the largest decline since the . depths of the recession in the spring of 2009, according to the Office . of National Statistics. The . ONS revealed the volume of products and services bought has taken its . biggest fall since the depths of the Great Recession but the amount . spent has risen. Homeform, the owner of Moben kitchens, bathroom chain Dolphin and Sharps bedrooms, said last week it intended to appoint administrators, putting 1,300 jobs at risk, while Comet owner Kesa said it was considering selling the electricals retailer after it posted losses of £8.9million. At Thorntons more than 700 jobs are at risk following months of falling sales for the Derbyshire-based confectioner. The company has issued several profit warnings, blaming everything from hot weather to arctic conditions for shoppers avoiding its 599 stores. But the firm has also suffered from a strategy focused on just two key periods during the year – Christmas and Easter. Chief executive Jonathan Hart said: ‘Our objective is to encourage existing customers to visit and purchase more frequently. ‘While Thorntons will always be strongly associated with key selling seasons, we will grow the relevance of other all year round gifting occasions.’ The problems are likely to fan flames on the debate over the coalition government's spending cuts. Labour is lobbying for a cut in VAT payments to help shops battling spiralling rent bills and bring relief to consumers. Habitat:Thirty . stores outside London put into administration. Around 900 jobs . threatened. Homebase and Argos owner, Home Retail Group, bought the . rights to the Habitat brand in the UK, the website and three stores in . central London for £24.5million. HomeForm: . About . 3,000 jobs at risk across 160 showrooms, including 1,500 fitters and . designers. The private equity owned business is behind Moben kitchens, . bathroom chain Dolphin and Sharps bedrooms. Administrators were called . in last week.

Badly affected by Icelandic banking crisis as Glitnir and Kaupthing held . significant stakes. Focus DIY:Ernst . & Young launched a closing down sale in May as it moved to shut 123 . stores out of the company's 178-strong store estate. The administrator . earlier managed to find buyers for 55 stores, including to Wickes owner . Travis Perkins, but the collapse of the chain left more than 3,000 . workers facing redundancy. Oddbins:The . wine merchant was the latest victim of a declining independent wine . trade in the UK, which also saw Threshers' owner, First Quench . Retailing, collapse in 2009. Oddbins had hoped to push through a rescue . deal but HM Revenues & Customs, which was owed £8 million by the . chain, refused to vote for the scheme. Whittals Wine Merchants bought 37 . Oddbins stores, securing more than 200 store jobs, but this left a . further 52 stores in the hands of administrators Deloitte. JJB Sports:The . sportswear chain was saved from administration after landlords and . creditors backed its second rescue deal in as many years. JJB's latest . company voluntary arrangement involved closing 43 unprofitable stores, . placing a further 46 under review and a move to monthly rental payments. The deal enabled it to raise £65 million from investors and secure a . new banking facility. HMV:The . sale of its Waterstone's book chain for £53 million has been key to . HMV's survival as the deal with Russian investor Alexander Mamut enabled . the high street retailer to negotiate a two-year extension to lending . facilities with its banks. HMV, which has around 260 stores in the UK . and Ireland, is now working on a plan to reduce its estate and focus . more on gadgets such as iPads. Mothercare:Mothercare . unveiled plans in May to close 110 outlets and focus on out-of-town . superstores. Rents will be cut on a further 40 stores, squeezing incomes . for high street landlords even further. The new focus will be on . out-of-town Parenting Centres, which contain its Early Learning Centre . brand. Maureen Hinton, senior retail analyst . at Verdict Research, told the Guardian: 'It feels every bit as bad as . at the height of the credit crunch when Woolworths collapsed. We are . going through a retrenchment that is probably as severe as we have seen . since the war.' She said . supply was outstripping demand and weak operators were at risk of . collapsing.

"By . Leon Watson . Last updated at 2:55 PM on 27th September 2011 . A televised bust-up with President Dmitry Medvedev has led to Russia's influential finance minister being forced from office. Mr Medvedev had angrily demanded that Alexei Kudrin immediately explain his criticism of his policies or resign. The open conflict within Russia's leadership follows the announcement over the weekend that prime minister Vladimir Putin plans to return to the presidency next year. Conflict: Russia's finance minister Alexei Kudrin speaks during a meeting chaired by President Dmitry Medvedev in the city of Dimitrovgrad . Mr Medvedev would then take his old job as prime minister. Russia will have a presidential vote in March, but Mr Putin is sure to win. The departure of Mr Kudrin is likely to unsettle investors and further shake Russia's markets. A close Putin ally, he has been finance minister since 2000 and his tight hold over the budget has been seen as key to Russia's economic stability. 'It is difficult to see how Mr Kudrin's resignation can be anything but market-negative,' said Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics Ltd in London. 'With oil prices starting to slide and financial markets still jittery, now is not a good time for the government to lose its arch fiscal hawk.' United: Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, right, and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin wave after announcing Putin will stand for president again . On Saturday, Mr Kudrin said he would refuse to serve in the government if Mr Medvedev was made prime minister because of policy disagreements he had with him, including plans to substantially boost military spending. Addressing Mr Kudrin yesterday, Mr Medvedev called the minister's remarks 'irresponsible chatter' and 'improper,' especially since they were made while the minister was in Washington for meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 'If you disagree with the course set by the president and being implemented by the government, you have only one choice: resign,' Mr Medvedev said. Mr Kudrin said he would decide only after talking to Mr Putin. 'You can seek the advice of whomever you want, but as long as I'm president, such decisions are made by me,' Mr Medvedev retorted. The Kremlin said Mr Medvedev signed a decree on Mr Kudrin's resignation. State news agencies reported that Mr Kudrin confirmed that he had quit. Mr Kudrin has been widely credited with helping Russia weather the 2008 to 2009 global financial crisis. During Mr Putin's presidency from 2000 to 2008, Mr Kudrin stashed some of the revenue from Russia's soaring oil exports into a stabilisation fund despite strong opposition from other ministers who wanted to spend the money. But when the financial crisis hit and oil prices sank sharply, those savings proved crucial in reducing the blow to Russia's economy.","Kudrin said he wouldn't work with him if he became PM .

Nasa is monitoring a piece of 'Russian' space junk that looks likely to come dangerously close to the International Space Station during a planned space walk tomorrow. The debris is heading towards the station, where Atlantis yesterday docked on its final mission. Scientists are still trying to work out how big the object is and how close it will come to Atlantis. Some believe it originated from a defunct Russian satellite that is orbiting Earth. LeRoy Cain, mission management team leader, said he hopes the space junk will keep a safe distance and as they observe its trajectory throughout today, they will be able to work out how close it will come. In danger? Atlantis docked at the International Space Station yesterday, just hours before Nasa scientists warned a piece of space junk is heading its way . A space walk is scheduled to take place on Tuesday afternoon, but this could now be threatened by the debris . Window on the world: Atlantis crew member Rex Walheim looks up at Earth . Atlantis seen here during a 'back flip' will engage its thrusters if the space junk gets too close . If it appears that the space junk is . getting too close for comfort, the astronauts will be able to use . thrusters to move Atlantis out of its way. Two . weeks ago, the crew of the ISS had to shelter in the lifeboats after a . piece of debris missed them by just over 1,000ft - the closest call to . date. Since the first object, Sputnik One, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris. The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel. It is estimated that there are 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit. Yesterday Atlantis landed at the International Space Station for the last time, two days after it became the final Nasa shuttle to blast into space. Writing the final chapter in a 30-year story of triumphs and tragedy, the last shuttle docked successfully after the astronauts on board spent most of their first full day in orbit checking the space shuttle for any damage from Friday's launch. Atlantis will now proceed with its mission to deliver more than four tons of supplies - enough for a year - and spare parts to the ISS as well as clearing rubbish and picking up a broken pump to transport back to Earth for inspection. As the shuttle made its final docking on the space station astronaut Ronald Garan Jr said: 'Atlantis arriving. Welcome to the International Space Station for the last time.'

The mission will also fly the Robotic Refuelling Mission (RRM), an experiment designed to demonstrate and test the tools, technologies and techniques needed to robotically refuel satellites in space - even satellites not designed to be serviced. To check the shield yesterday, they used the shuttle's robot arm and an extension to slowly examine the most vulnerable parts of the shuttle's outer edges, a safety check that has become the norm since 2003, when the space shuttle Columbia was destroyed when it returned to Earth because of damage during lift off. On Saturday, the astronauts were woken up at 3.59am by Coldplay's Viva la Vida - dedicated to pilot Doug Hurley - as well as a mass greeting from the many employees of Nasa's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville. 'Good morning, Atlantis,' the workers said in a message recorded before launch. 'The Marshall Space Flight Center hopes you enjoyed your ride to orbit.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:27 PM on 27th September 2011 . It is a small town where people haven't locked their doors in years. But the deaths of five people have shaken the rural community of Laurel, in rural Indiana, to its core. Police say they have no suspects in the case after the shocking deaths, which were discovered on Sunday. Bodies: Teresa Richardson leaves after talking with a state trooper at the entrance to the home of her former brother-in-law, Roy Napier . Officers were first called at around . 1:30pm on Sunday when a four-year-old child was seen wandering alone in the . road. After speaking to the child, police were led to a house where the body of one man was found inside. They then discovered the bodies of four other people, two men and two women, inside another home across the street. Indiana State Police said in a statement: 'At this time there is no person or persons of interest or suspect/suspects.' 'We are continuing to follow numerous tips and leads and we are encouraging the public to continue contacting us with those tips and leads.' The dead have been named locally as Angie Napier, Roy Napier, their two adult children Melissa Napier and Jacob Napier, and their friend Henry Smith, whose body was found at a separate property nearby. Autopsies of four of the victims were conducted Monday in Indianapolis and the fifth will take place today. Investigators hope the autopsies will offer clues to the crime. Discovery: Trees and brush surround the mobile home of Roy Napier where four people were found dead in rural Franklin County near Laurel . Neighbour Ryan Renfro told Fox News: 'People who haven't locked their doors in years, they're definitely locking up tight now. 'I actually took off work today because I'm here with my elderly grandparents and I didn't want to leave them here alone until they caught who they are looking for.' Officers have also interviewed a witness who reported seeing someone drag a body in or out of one of the properties, according to the station. Family and neighbours speculated that drug activity, which they said had been prevalent in the area, may have been to blame. Teresa Richardson, who is Angie . Napier's sister, called the deaths a 'senseless massacre'. But she . admitted the family had been involved with drugs. Franklin County Sheriff Ken Murphy said his deputies had been to the address, where four of the bodies were found, previously. Resident Debra Richardson told Fox . News said she has complained frequently to police about what she . believed to be drug dealers at the mobile home. Discovery: Three men and two women were found dead in two homes in rural Indiana . 'I have a greenhouse business, and . they had more traffic than I do,' she said. 'I'm in here working in the . greenhouse and I see people pulling in all the time. You don't have that . many people visit you.' Kerry Wren, a neighbour of the Napiers, said drug use has been a problem in the area for years. She said the most popular drug was now painkillers, more than meth. Neighbours said that they had heard gunshots, but had not raised the alarm because hunting season had recently started. Neighbour Josh Murray said that the small community has been shaken by the shooting. 'I'm still trying to process everything. I'm trying to take in everything that is going on,' he told local station 6 News. 'It seems crazy that something like that would happen in a small town like that,' fellow resident Nikki Switzer told the station.","Police have no suspects in mysterious murder .

"By . Sophie Borland . Last updated at 12:19 PM on 26th September 2011 . Dr Peter Carter, head of the Royal College of Nursing, was forced to defend his remarks . Relatives should go into hospitals to help staff care for the elderly, according to a nursing leader. Dr Peter Carter, head of the Royal . College of Nursing, said families should be encouraged to assist . patients during mealtimes and take them to the toilet. He also wants hospitals to end restricted visiting times so relatives can stay as long as they want. Dr Carter warned that on some wards there were too few nurses to help all frail patients eat their meals or go to the toilet. He said: ‘If you have a 24-bed ward . and have got five nurses and everybody is having lunch at the same time . and half the patients need feeding, it becomes difficult to get it all . done. ‘If someone is coming in and sitting . with their loved one, they are going to have the focused dedicated time. You get this business of wards, very, very busy people, patients dying . to go to the loo, elderly patients wetting themselves, then they lie . there feeling embarrassed – and it is about helping gran get out and go . to the loo.’ Figures show the average ‘care of the . elderly’ ward has just one nurse for 11 patients – substantially fewer . than in other parts of many hospitals. A report by the RCN last year found . nurses on these wards were looking after an average of three more . patients compared with children’s wards, for example. Only last week Dr Carter warned that . nurses were beginning their career unable to care for patients as they . spend too much time in lecture halls. He also said untrained healthcare . assistants with no medical qualifications now carry out many tasks once . reserved for nurses, such as helping patients to eat and drink, cleaning . bedsores and taking blood samples. Pitching in: Dr Carter warned that on some wards there were too few nurses to help all frail patients eat their meals or go to the toilet . Dr Carter has asked the Royal College of Nursing to consider ways to encourage more families to help out on wards. ‘If patients are in hospital then it is hospital staff who surely have a duty of care to look after patients’ needs such as feeding them and ensuring they are clean, washed and dry’ Director general of SAGA . ‘The NHS is just not going to deal . with it. Neither are social services,’ he said. ‘You have got to get . maximum family involvement. ‘The services need to gear themselves . up to make people aware: You are very welcome to come in and look after . mum, dad, husband and wife.’ Many hospitals will allow relatives to visit only during the afternoon, for example from 2pm to 8pm. And many have ‘protective mealtimes’ which ban visitors coming to the ward whilst food is being served in . case it distracts patients from eating. But Dr Carter wants visiting times to be more flexible, particularly during mealtimes so families can help patients eat. His views are backed up by Dr Clare . Gerada, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, who said the NHS could not . afford to employ staff to sit with the elderly for hours on end. ‘Families . should be more involved,’ she said. ‘Can we afford to have someone . sitting by an elderly person in hospital and feeding them, which might . take two or three hours.’ But Dr Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, the over-50s group, said the suggestion was ‘astonishing’. ‘If patients are in hospital then it . is hospital staff who surely have a duty of care to look after patients’ needs such as feeding them and ensuring they are clean, washed and . dry,’ she said. Official NHS figures show that last year 214,888 patients were discharged from hospital with some form of malnutrition. The Care Quality Commission watchdog this year found that in some hospitals the elderly were going without food for several days. This means their immune systems will be far weaker and they are less able to cope with potentially fatal illnesses such as flu and pneumonia. Lacking calcium and vitamin D, they will be prone to osteoporosis and  associated hip fractures and other broken bones. Some hospitals now employ volunteer feeders – members of the public who come in during meal times to help patients too frail to eat.","Dr Peter Carter says families should help patients at mealtimes and take them to the toilet .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:26 PM on 10th September 2011 . A major power outage, which left more than six million people in California and Arizona in darkness, was caused by a single maintenance worker, it has been revealed. The power cut took two nuclear reactors offline, grounded flights, caused major traffic jams and trapped people in elevators and on fairground rides in both states. San Diego bore the brunt of the blackout and most of the nation's eighth-largest city was darkened. The city trolley system that shuttles thousands of commuters every day was shut down and rush hour traffic hit gridlock. Scroll down for video . Darker than usual: Despite lights showing in San Diego buildings, the city was without power after a blackout on caused havoc on Thursday . Going nowhere: Passenger Michael Moretti waits at the baggage pick-up at San Diego International Airport after a massive blackout hit Southern California . By candlelight: The power outage didn't end the night for visitors to Voyeur in San Diego's Gaslamp District . The San Diego County Sheriff's Department and other police departments told 10News.com that they have received reports of break-ins and vandalism at homes and businesses. The Sheriff's department received reports of a glass door broken at a taco store in Lemon Grove and a report of a home break-in in Vista during the outage. A suspect in San Diego was arrested after he was found to have items from a Kensington area home where neighbours had reported a possible robbery. APS, Arizona's largest electricity provider, said a utility worker doing maintenance near Yuma triggered the blackout. The error, on a high-voltage power line linking Arizona and San Diego, causing a cascading series of electrical grid failures stretching into Southern California. Authorities say the outage was accidentally triggered sometime Thursday afternoon when the APS electrical worker removed a piece of monitoring equipment at a power substation in southwest Arizona. An APS statement said: 'The outage appears to be related to a procedure an APS employee was carrying out in the North Gila substation. Lights out: Buildings in downtown San Diego look eerily abandoned as the blackout drags on. A single worker was responsible for the power cut . Inconvenience store: A shopper is forced to make her grocery choices in the dark at her local store. More than six million people and businesses were affected . 'Operating and protection protocols . typically would have isolated the resulting outage to the Yuma area. The . reason that did not occur in this case will be the focal point of the . investigation into the event, which already is underway.' Daniel Froetscher, an APS vice president, said authorities . quickly ruled out any sabotage or, in the anxious days leading up to . the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11 attacks, any suggestion of terrorism. Power tripped: Map shows the affected areas of the power outage . 'This was not a deliberate act. The employee was just switching out a piece of equipment that was problematic.' For obvious reasons, APS did not name the employee. It's possible that extreme heat in the region also may have caused some problems with the transmission lines, one expert said. Many minor traffic accidents occurred as the outage caused mayhem on streets without stoplights during rush hour. Leah Walden, 59, of California, said she saw about five fender-bender crashes on one trip out. Ms Walden said: 'People are irritated. They don't want to wait.' In the beach town of Encinitas north of San Diego, Tim Grenda, 41, put a positive spin on the situation, pointing out that his hot yoga class was cooler as a result of the outage. Rosa Maria Gonzales, a spokeswoman with the Imperial Irrigation District in California's sizzling eastern desert, was less enthusiastic - temperatures were well into triple-digit territory when the power went out. Ms Gonzales said: 'It feels like you're in an oven and you can't escape.' Many offices closed during the outage but workers were caught in gridlock conditions because traffic lights were out. Early Friday morning, power was on the way to being restored for some six million people affected by the outage. Nearly . 700,000 of the 1.4million customers who lost power Southern California . saw their lights come on at about 2:45am local time, the Los Angeles . Times reported. Hospital . emergency rooms switched to backup generators, while police stations . also had to rely on generators to accept emergency calls across the area . and officers struggled to direct traffic at intersections where signals . were out. The blackout extended from southern . Orange County to San Diego to Yuma, Arizona. It is also affecting cities . south of the border, with much of the state of northern Baja in . darkness. Stock up: People line up outside an Encitas, California, 7-Eleven store to pick up supplies . Over the border: Even the city of Tijuana, in the Mexican state of Baja California, was affected - with only the lights of cars visible throughout the city .

'It . feels like you're in an oven and you can't escape,' said Rosa Maria . Gonzales, a spokeswoman with the Imperial Irrigation District in . California's sizzling eastern desert. It was about 115 degrees when the power went out for about 150,000 of its customers, she said. FBI officials ruled out terrorism . while power plant authorities struggled to find the cause of the outage . that started shortly before 4pm local time. A . transmitter line between Arizona and California was severed, said Mike . Niggli, chief operating officer of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., . causing the outage. The extreme heat in some areas also may have caused . some problems with the lines. People were trapped in elevators and on rides at Sea World in San Diego and Legoland in Carlsbad. The San Onofre nuclear power plant . went offline at 3.30pm as they are programmed to do when there is a . disturbance in the power grid, said Charles Coleman, a spokesman from Southern California Edison. He said there was no danger to the public or to workers there. The . outage came more than eight years after a more severe black out in 2003 . darkened a large swath of the Northeast and Midwest. More than 50 million people were affected in that outage. Five . hundred to 2,000 SoCal Edison customers in southern Orange County and . Riverside County are currently without power and there is no estimate . for when power will be restored, Coleman said. A pain at the pump: People park their cars at an Encinitas, California, gas station, waiting for the power to come back on last night .

Slow progress in all directions: Freeway traffic was gridlocked in both directions as traffic signals went down and police struggled to keep vehicles moving . Capt. Mike Stone of the Orange County Fire Authority said several people were trapped and rescued at the tony Ritz Carlton hotel in south Orange County, Stone said. In southern Orange County, the sheriff's department dispatched deputies to busy intersections because traffic lights were out, said John McDonald, a sheriff's spokesman. Outages were confirmed in San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano and Laguna Hills, he said.","Authorities say a worker triggered the blackout when he removed a piece of monitoring equipment at a power substation .

Jade Goody's mother has said her daughter feared her phone was being hacked. Jackiey Budden also believes she was targeted weeks before Jade died. Publicist Max Clifford told the Guardian: 'She will be going to the police. She believes her phone was hacked by the News of the World, and Jade’s. 'Jade told me, ‘I’m convinced my phone is being hacked’.” Scotland Yard and News International declined to comment on the allegations. Mr Clifford told Sky News: 'According to Jackiey, there were several stories which . could only have been obtained through hacking.' 'If your daughter is dying, to know that confidential messages are being . listened to - you can imagine how any mother would feel,' he added. The reality TV star died aged 27 on Mother's Day 2009 after a very . public battle with cervical cancer. Jade . was diagnosed in August 2008 and was told the news while . she was on Big Boss, India's version of Big Brother. In February 2009, she was told the cancer had spread to her liver, bowel and . groin and was now terminal. In further revelations, it appears a former News of the World executive received thousands of pounds of secret payments from News International while working at Scotland Yard. Neil Wallis picked up £25,000 during late 2009 and in 2010 for providing ‘crime exclusives’, detailing Metropolitan Police investigations. Secret payments: Neil Wallis received money from News International while working for the Metropolitan Police . He was working as a consultant for Sir Paul Stephenson, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, and being paid £24,000 a year by the taxpayer. The details of the payments from . Rupert Murdoch’s media company have been found by detectives probing . phone hacking at the News of the World. The Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Wallis may have been selling stories to other newspapers while working at Scotland Yard. He was deputy to News of the World editor Andy Coulson at the time phone hacking was taking place. Known as the ‘Wolfman’, he was made executive editor after Mr Coulson resigned as editor. He then left News International in August 2009. A month later he joined the Met on a two-day-a-month contract advising top officers. Mr Wallis resigned from Scotland Yard last September following allegations of phone hacking at his former paper, and this July he was arrested on suspicion of intercepting phone messages. Details of his employment led to the resignation from the Met of Sir Paul and another senior officer, John Yates. Andy Coulson is suing News Group Newspapers, his former employer . It was reported last night that during his employment at Scotland Yard, he received payments totalling £25,000 from News International. This included a payment of £10,000 for a single crime story. Police believe one of the stories he fed to the media company included details of a suspected assassination attempt on the Pope during last year’s visit. It also emerged last night that Mr Coulson may have started the process of suing his bosses at the defunct newspaper. Legal documents lodged in London yesterday show that News Group Ltd, which owned the News of the World, is being sued by a Mr A Coulson. Mr Coulson became David Cameron’s director of communications after his stint as editor of the disgraced paper. He resigned from Downing Street in January and was arrested by detectives and questioned over phone hacking in July. Rupert Murdoch has apologised for the 'serious wrongdoing' of the News of the World phone hacking scandal which brought down the Sunday tabloid . Neither News International nor Mr Coulson would comment over whether the ‘Mr A Coulson’ is indeed the former editor. If it is, it is likely the lawsuit is linked to News International’s decision to stop paying his legal bills. Glenn . Mulcaire, the private investigator jailed in 2007 over phone hacking, . sued the company last month after the company stopped paying his legal . fees. The case, A Coulson v News Group Newspapers Ltd, will be heard at the High Court of Justice, Queen’s Bench Division. Last . month, it emerged that Mr Coulson continued to receive payments agreed . as part of a severance package even after he was taken on by the .

"By . Stephanie Darrall . Last updated at 4:38 PM on 27th September 2011 . Legal history was made today when a Broadmoor Hospital patient had his appeal against being locked up heard in public. The mental health tribunal for Albert Haines, 52, who has been diagnosed with a personality disorder, offered a rare glimpse into the usually hidden world of the famous high-security psychiatric institution. Members of the press were given full access to the proceedings, which despite the sensitive mental health issues being discussed, were reportable for the first time. Secure: A patient at Broadmoor (pictured) has made legal history by publicly appealing against detention . Mr Haines also attended the . landmark hearing in a basement room of Field House in Chancery Lane, . central London, becoming the first psychiatric patient to seek his . freedom under the gaze of the public eye. After being held in secure hospitals . for 25 years following a conviction for two counts of attempted wounding . in September 1986, he successfully argued that his case should be . considered at an open hearing after saying he wanted to expose alleged . failings in the system. The tribunal panel was told he did not . think there was anything wrong with him and believed his discharge was . 'in the moral public interest'. Aswini Weereratne, representing Mr Haines, pointed out that he had not killed anybody and argued that 'to spend 25 years as a result of these incidents seems disproportionate'. She also suggested her client had not been properly treated for the post-traumatic stress disorder he was said to have suffered in the wake of his difficult childhood. The three-man panel heard he had a 'sense he is a victim of the system' and that he 'desperately doesn't want to be (in custody) and is angry at being there'. This anger could account for some of his behaviour within the hospital, his lawyer told the hearing. But Dr Jose Romero-Urcelay, Mr . Haines's responsible clinician, argued that the patient remained a risk . to the public and to himself. He said: 'Mr Haines would struggle to live independently' adding 'I think it would be inevitable there would be an incident of violence.' And he told Ms Weereratne there were . other patients who had been detained at Broadmoor for similar or even . lesser offences than Mr Haines's. He told the panel Mr Haines had . suffered deprivation and neglect during childhood and had later reported . being abused and using cannabis, cocaine and amphetamines. The patient now believed he was being . persecuted and had sought the public hearing in part because he feared . mental health hearings were not impartial, the doctor said. 'I believe he suffers from paranoid . psychosis,' he said, adding that Mr Haines had a 'constant preoccupation . with a conspiracy he feels he is the victim of'. Broadmoor psychiatric hospital is home to some of Britain's most dangerous criminals, including Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe (left) and Robert Napper . Outlining the patient's behaviour, he . described him as abusive and threatening towards staff at Broadmoor and . argued that 'the evidence is that Mr Haines would not be able to cope . with a normal environment'. Mr Haines, however, could be released in about two years' time if he complied with his treatment, the doctor estimated. Not all the doctors who have seen Mr . Haines share that opinion about his condition however, with another . medic reporting that he showed no current psychotic symptoms, the . tribunal heard. Vikram Sachdeva, counsel for . Broadmoor, asked: 'Why would Mr Haines have confidence if the doctors . are all thinking different things?' But Dr Romero-Urcelay said: 'We are . not a precise science. We don't have a blood test or an X-ray that would . give you a diagnosis.' He added: 'I would never be in a position to make any Machiavellian decisions. It would have to be done with a second opinion.' An estimated 100,000 mental health . tribunals have been held in the past seven years, but of these there . were only 10 applications for the hearing to be held in public. Only one previous application for an open session was granted, and this was later withdrawn. Broadmoor, in Crowthorne, Berkshire, . is home to some of Britain's most dangerous criminals, including . Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe and serial killer Robert Napper.","Albert Haines, 52, has been in secure hospitals .

The £479 Sony Tablet P has two 5.5in touchscreens and can be folded in half, making it more portable than the iPad and other similar devices. Sony says it will easily fit inside a handbag or jacket pocket. It is £20 cheaper than an iPad 2 with the same wi-fi and 3G internet access. Looking to steal some of the iPad's thunder: Sony Tablet P was one of two new products unveiled by the global tech giant in Berlin today ahead of a Christmas sales war . Sleek: Sony also unveiled a more conventional tablet, the Tablet S . The two sides of the tablet can be . combined and used as one large screen – albeit with a potentially . irritating hinge running through the middle. They can also operate independently, with one running a game and one running emails, for example. Like other tablet computers it can download music and videos and has cameras on the front and back, allowing for video calls.

"By . Paul Thompson . Last updated at 6:30 PM on 28th September 2011 . A 15-year-old boy is facing a double murder charge after he shot dead his 'controlling' parents. Matt Liewald is alleged to have snapped after being pulled out of school and rarely allowed out of his home by his strict father. A neighbour heard his step-mother begging 'please don't do this' before several gunshots were heard. Matt Liewald, 15, has been charged with two counts of murder for allegedly killing his father, 43-year-old Christian Hans Liewald, and stepmom, 24-year-old Cassie Meghan Liewald, in their North Carolina bedroom . Christian Liewald, 43, and his wife Cassie Buckaloo, 24, were found dead in bed at their home in Pineville, North Carolina. His teenage son called police to give himself up after allegedly shooting his parents as they lay in bed. He has been charged with murder and is being held in a juvenile facility. Family members have claimed Liewald was controlling and was too strict on his teenage son. One theory being investigated by police is that Matt rebelled against his father's control. Liewald, who ran an alternative school, dangled a pair of handcuffs from his car's rear view mirror and walked around the neighbourhood with a gun. CCTV cameras were trained on the property and a 'No Trespassing' sign was tacked to the house. Police found the couple dead in their home in early Monday morning. Liewald was reportedly a controlling father who had pulled his son from school and kept 'No Trespassing' signs and CCTV on his property . Neighbors said the family kept to themselves and Matt, who rarely came out of the house, was being home schooled after being removed from public school for fighting. 'I always hear the young guy was confined to the house. He didn't have no friends. He never smiled. I think it was soon coming,' said neighbor Alfred De'nise. Several neighbors said Christian Liewald had clashed with them. 'He carried a gun, and it frightened some of us,' said one woman. Another neighbor, Amy Taylor, said, 'We backed away from Christian. He is weird. A lot of us had concerns about it.' Neighbors say the late Liewald was intimidating and carried a gun and handcuffs around the neighborhood. He reportedly rarely let his son leave the home, causing the teen to snap . Neighbor Greg Hicks said he was shot and wounded by Liewald several years ago during a dispute.  Court records show Liewald was charged in June 2007 with assault with a deadly weapon, but the charges were later dropped. The shootings took place shortly after 2am. Neighbour Jesse Loosemore said he and his wife heard Buckaloo's screams. 'I think we may have heard that poor lady's last words: ""Oh, please don't do this"".' Police said Matt made two telephone calls to police, firstly asking police to come to his home but not giving a reason. In a second call he admitted to shooting his parents and told them he would be waiting on a street corner near their home.","Matt Liewald, 15, charged with two murders for deaths of Christian Liewald, 43, and Cassie Buckaloo, 24 .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 10:19 PM on 27th July 2011 . Alive: Arthur Gerald Jones, 72, disappeared more than 30 years ago . The man who forced a probe that found a former commodities broker alive after he disappeared in 1979 and was declared legally dead has been revealed as a Phoenix nurse. Clifton Goodenough, 50, a nurse in a veterans’ hospital in Arizona, fought with the Internal Revenue Service as they kept taking funds from his bank account and cutting his wages. But after 16 years of grief, the mystery was solved when father-of-three Arthur Gerald Jones, 72, of Chicago, Illinois, was found living under a false name and working at a casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Jones was reported missing in 1979 and declared dead by an Illinois court in 1986. FBI agents had investigated his disappearance as suspicious and focused on possible mob connections. Jones was arrested last Tuesday on four counts related to identity theft and fraud after officials say he renewed his Nevada driver's licence in 2008 under his assumed name, Joseph Richard Sandelli. Jones allegedly paid a friend in Chicago $800 for fake documents and a Social Security number belonging to Mr Goodenough before he disappeared, authorities say, which caused the Arizona man untold grief. Mr Goodenough was involved in a . long-term battle with the IRS over ‘extra income’ he had supposedly . earned in Las Vegas every year since 1995 and had annual financial . issues to resolve. He told MailOnline that he even went as far as to employ a certified public accountant because he was having so many financial issues to sort out. The IRS were querying him 'every year or sometimes more,' he said. Hideout: Jones settled in Las Vegas in 1988, where he worked for the Rampart Casino's Sports Book, authorities said . But eventually the IRS provided . documents naming a person he could link to his troubles in ‘Sandelli’, . who was using his Social Security number, reported the Las Vegas . Review-Journal. Mr Goodenough actually called . ‘Sandelli’ last year to chat about their shared problem on the phone, but he . claims to have known something was up when they started discussing their . personal details. ‘The more I thought about it . afterward, I realised he was just agreeing with whatever real . information I'd say, to lead me to believe this was just a colossal . government mix-up' Clifton Goodenough . ‘I told him I was born in a Lake . Forest Hospital in Illinois, and he'd say: “So was I”,’ Mr Goodenough . told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ‘The more I thought about it . afterward, I realised he was just agreeing with whatever real . information I'd say, to lead me to believe this was just a colossal . government mix-up.’ Mr Goodenough also thought it was odd . that ‘Sandelli’ allegedly offered to get a new number from the Social . Security Administration even though he was around a retirement age. But Mr Goodenough continued to get . questions from the IRS about his earnings and eventually decided to . write to Arizona Republican and U.S. Senator John McCain's office for . help. Four months later a huge . investigation resulted in Jones allegedly admitting his story to investigators and . being charged. Mr Goodenough has praised Senator McCain's office ‘for . getting me a resolution’. ‘I'm just still kind of shocked and . amazed,’ he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ‘My family in Chicago . keeps seeing my name in the news.’ Jones' lawyer, Stephen Stein, said . last week the Nevada attorney general's office is offering his client a . plea deal that would allow him to plead guilty on one of the charges and . face probation. Jones was released on a $20,000 bond last week and is next set for an August 23 court hearing. ‘I'm just still kind of shocked and . amazed. My family in Chicago . keeps seeing my name in the news' Clifton Goodenough . A criminal complaint filed last week . in Las Vegas Justice Court painted the picture of a powerful Chicago . financier tormented by snowballing gambling debts. Jones told investigators he held a . seat with the Chicago Board of Trade and lived with his wife, Joanne . Esplin, and three young children in Highland Park, Illinois. But Jones said he was forced to sell his board seat to pay debts, according to the affidavit. Esplin said her husband forged her . name to get a second mortgage on the couple's home and pay personal . gambling debts, the document alleged. She said she suspected he was . delivering money or running errands for the Chicago mob. Assistance: Mr Goodenough was getting questions from the IRS about his earnings and eventually decided to write to Senator John McCain's office for help . His marriage troubled and finances in . shambles, Jones told investigators he decided to leave to get a 'fresh . start', the affidavit said. Esplin and Jones had been married 17 years . when he disappeared. According to the affidavit, Esplin . told investigators the last time she saw her husband - whose gambling . once led him to bet $30,000 on a basketball game - was May 11, 1979, . when he left to run an errand. She said he looked very nervous at the . time. Jones never spoke to his family or . friends again. Presuming he had died, Social Security paid his family . $47,000 in survivor benefits, the document said. Earlier this month, investigators . from the Social Security Administration contacted Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles officials. They were investigating Jones for using the Social Security number of . Mr Goodenough. Investigators say Jones used his . ‘Sandelli’ alias to get a Nevada driver's license when he moved to . Nevada in 1988, and renewed it in 2008. Authorities say he also lived in . Florida and California after leaving Chicago. According to investigators, he moved he settled in Las Vegas in 1988, where he worked for the Rampart Casino's Sports Book. Mr Stein said his client has friends in Las Vegas who 'consider him family' and who sprang to his defence after the arrest. A DMV spokesman said cases like this . are turning up more frequently as computer databases improve and law . enforcement agencies are better able to communicate among themselves.","Arthur Jones faked death 'because of gambling debts'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:10 AM on 29th September 2011 . The Briton accused of murdering his wife on honeymoon can face trial in South Africa. Home Secretary Theresa May has rubber-stamped an order that Shrien Dewani be extradited to answer claims he masterminded the killing of 28-year-old Anni. But the 31-year-old care home owner has signalled he will continue his legal fight and has 14 days to lodge an appeal. Decision: Shrien Dewani is a step closer to being extradited to South Africa . Dewani, from Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, denies claims he offered to pay two hitmen £1,400 to carry out the killing. Taxi driver Zola Tongo has already . been jailed for 18 years after admitting his part in the crime. Two . other men, one seriously ill with a brain tumour, face trial next year. Police insist that Dewani is central . to  the plot and plan to charge him with  conspiracy, murder, kidnap, . robbery  and obstructing justice. A Home Office spokesman said: 'On Monday September 26 the Home Secretary, having carefully considered all relevant matters, signed an order for Shrien Prakash Dewani's extradition to South Africa. Happy couple: But Anni Dewani was killed on their honeymoon . 'Mr Dewani now has the opportunity, . within 14 days, to appeal to the High Court against the decision of the . District Judge and/or the Home Secretary.' Mrs May's decision came after District Judge Howard Riddle ruled at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court last month that Dewani, 31, should be sent back to South Africa to stand trial. Suspicion fell on him after Mrs Dewani, . 28, was shot dead when the couple's cab was hijacked in the dangerous . Gugulethu township. Victim: Mrs Dewani was just 28 years old when she died . Taxi driver Zola Tongo, who has admitted his part in the crime, claimed in a plea agreement with prosecutors that Dewani ordered the carjacking and paid for a hit on his wife. Dewani, who is said to be suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder, denies any wrongdoing. It was reported earlier this month that he had hired a team of private investigators to hunt for fresh evidence on his wife's death. He is believed to have spent £40,000 on top lawyers to help fight his defence if he is extradited. The company boss has argued that he would be denied a fair trial in South Africa, and said he could be abused in prison. The Home Secretary's ruling was welcomed by Mrs Dewani's family today. Ashok Hindocha, her uncle, said: 'We are very happy about this decision. We were expecting this but we weren't expecting the decision to come this early. 'It shows that finally the system is working and we're happy that this can come to a closure.' The Hindocha family handed in a petition to the Home Office last week, imploring Mrs May to ensure Dewani was extradited. Dewani standing trial is the only way they can get the answers they need, they say.",Dewani has 14 days to appeal decision which would make him stand trial for his wife Anni's murder .
"By . Paul Sims . Last updated at 9:19 AM on 28th September 2011 . Raoul Moat died on 10 July 2010, aged 37, after a six-hour stand-off with police . Firearms officers who shot crazed gunman Raoul Moat with an untried, untested and unapproved Taser were yesterday cleared of any wrong-doing. Moat, 37, deliberately pulled the trigger of his sawn-off shotgun at the end of a tense six-hour stand-off with police last July after one of the Taser rounds struck his arm, an inquest jury found. The gunman, who had been on the run for seven days, had been cornered by firearms officers on the banks of the River Coquet in Rothbury, Northumberland. But the jury returned a suicide verdict yesterday, concluding there was no evidence to suggest the 500-volt Taser round which hit his arm caused him to inadvertently pull the trigger. Although Moat momentarily rocked backwards after being hit with the Taser – prompting him to cry out in pain – he instantly resumed his position, pressed the gun back to his temple and defiantly pulled the trigger. John Beggs QC, representing Northumbria Police during the £1million, three-week inquest, said he hoped the jury’s findings would finally ‘lay to rest’ the ‘ill-informed’ criticism that had previously emerged over the use of the Taser. Meanwhile an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission cleared the officers of misconduct. But the watchdog noted that they had not received any proper training before being handed the weapon. Cleared of wrongdoing: Police during their confrontation with fugitive Raoul Moat . Bystanders and children take photographs at West Cemetery and Crematorium in Newcastle, after the funeral of Raoul Moat . And questions will remain over the deployment of a weapon which has now been withdrawn from use by the Home Office. It was the first, and last, time the Extended Range Electronic Projectile Taser has ever been used in the UK, the inquest heard. Dubbed the ‘super Taser’, the XREP has a range five times longer than the conventional version and delivers a shock lasting 20 seconds, four times longer than the those currently in use. 1 Moat warned his girlfriend, Samantha . Stobbart, he would 'go crazy' after she split up with him . 2 Police found a noose . and six suicide notes in his Fenham home in Newcastle, when it was raided . 3 He told police negotiators he got so hungry he ate dead mice while living rough around Rothbury, Northumberland . 4 At the climax of the stand-off with police, Moat moved his sawn-off . shotgun from under his chin to his right temple, causing police to . believe he was about to kill himself . 5 The XRep Taser round . which hit him on the arm probably only caused a small electrical . discharge, if it did at all, and it did not penetrate his skin . 6 Being shot by a Taser did not cause him to accidentally pull the . trigger of his sawn-off shotgun, according to an expert on the effects . of electrical pulses on the nervous system . 7 Witnesses said there was a gap of up to two seconds between Moat being hit by the Taser and him pulling the trigger8 The XRep Taser shotgun cartridges fired from X12 shotguns are . 'conceptually' sound but in tests failed to work 'more often than not', . according to the Home Office . 9 Moat's heart was still beating when he arrived at Newcastle General Hospital, despite a brain injury that was non-survivable . 10 A 1cm ball bearing, believed to be the bullet which killed Moat, fell . on to the hospital floor after medics stopped operating - it had probably lodged in the hood of his top . Last night Moat’s half-brother Angus, 41, said he still believed using it was a ‘mistake’. He also criticised the way the inquest was set up. ‘A coroner’s inquest is intended to be non-adversarial, however at times it has felt like this inquest has been a three against one contest,’ he said. ‘Barristers representing Northumbria Police, ProTec [which supplied the Taser] and individual West Yorkshire officers were all pushing in one direction to justify police tactics and strategy. ‘The only opposition was legal representation for my family.’ Moat, who had been released from prison just 48 hours before his shooting rampage in July last year, critically wounded his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart, 23, and killed her new lover, 29-year-old Christopher Brown. He also blinded PC David Rathband, 43, who was blasted twice as he sat defenceless in his traffic car at a roundabout. After Moat was cornered on July 9, negotiators attempted to persuade him to give himself up, but in the early hours of the following day he made a ‘deliberate’ movement with the gun, the inquest was told. It was then that two firearms officers from West Yorkshire Police – working as part of an operation led by Northumbria Police – fired a round from the controversial XREP Taser, which had not been approved by the Home Office. The inquest jury of five women and five men concluded the use of the XREP was ‘appropriate’. The jury said that after Moat was struck: ‘The gun momentarily moved away from his head. ‘Mr Moat corrected himself to his original position and repositioned the gun to his temple. Mr Moat then discharged the gun and shot himself.’ Meanwhile the IPCC report concluded that there was no evidence officers were guilty of misconduct. Last night Northumbria Police Chief Constable Sue Sim said: ‘Our use of the XREP shot gun Taser was carefully considered. The evidence was clear. There were simply no other options available to us to stop Moat from taking his own life.’",Despite the fast-moving events IPCC ruled that the force displayed a 'clear rationale'
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:46 PM on 30th September 2011 . A document obtained by the ACLU shows for the first time how the four largest cellphone companies in the U.S. treat data about their subscribers' calls, text messages, Web surfing and approximate locations. The one-page document from the Justice Department's cybercrime division shows, for instance, that Verizon Wireless keeps for one year information about which cell towers subscriber phones connect to. That data that can be used to figure out where the phone has been, down to the level of a neighborhood. AT&T has kept the same data since July 2008. A new document obtained by ACLU revealed the varying degrees to which cell phone companies keep users information. T-Mobile USA doesn't keep any information on Web browsing activity . The sheet is a guide for law enforcement, which can request the information from the carriers through legal channels. Where's Kim? Data stored by the phone companies can track movement down to a specific neighborhood . The North Carolina section of the American Civil Liberties Union obtained it through a Freedom of Information Act request, the ACLU said. Wired.com reported earlier about the document, which is dated Aug. 2010. The document was released by the ACLU Wednesday, but has been hiding in plain sight on the website of the Vermont public defender's office. It can be found there through a Google search, but only if the searcher knows the exact title of the document. A few data points from the sheet were known outside law enforcement circles, but wireless carriers have not been open about their policies. They aren't required to keep the data, and they keep the same information for varying lengths of time. Some don't keep data at all that other companies store. For instance, it says T-Mobile USA doesn't keep any information on Web browsing activity. Verizon, on the other hand, keeps some information for up to a year that can be used to ascertain if a particular phone visited a particular Web site. According to the sheet, Sprint Nextel Corp.'s Virgin Mobile brand keeps the text content of text messages for three months. Verizon keeps it for three to five days. None of the other carriers keep texts at all, but they keep records of who texted who for more than a year. The document says AT&T keeps for five to seven years a record of who text messages who -and when, but not the content of the messages. Virgin Mobile only keeps that data for two to three months. The carriers don't have recordings of calls, but keep information about calls that are made and received for at least a year. The ACLU said it believes people have a right to know how long phone companies keep records of their activities. Although the sheet is dated August . 2010, Tom Slovenski, a private investigator specializing in cellphone . data, said it is still accurate. Sprint . spokesman Jason Gertzen said he couldn't comment on the specific . figures in the sheet. Normally, he said, a subpoena, court order, or . customer consent form from a recognized law enforcement agency is . necessary for the carrier to hand out data. People who have AT&T should be aware, the ACLU believes, that data on who and when they text is kept by the company for 5-7 years . However, Sprint also responds to emergency requests, as in missing persons cases, if the police can document their need, he said. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A bill in Congress would force wired Internet service providers to keep records of the network addresses assigned to each subscriber for 18 months. That would help investigators link online activity to specific homes. But the bill doesn't apply to wireless links. A series of such bills have been proposed over the years, but haven't passed.","Document obtained by ACLU reveals each phone company's habits on saving information .

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 1:05 PM on 28th September 2011 . Stock markets have soared around the world over hopes that Europe has finally found a way out of its debt crisis. Greece passed an unpopular property tax and German Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged to offer the struggling country 'all necessary assistance' last night. But it is unclear whether that will be enough to satisfy investors for long. Pledge of support: German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou met in Berlin last night to talk about resolving Greece's debt problems . Private dinner: The two leaders, pictured on a balcony at the Chancellery, did not announce any new measures but stock markets soared after Ms Merkel's promise of support . Financial ties: Ms Merkel shakes hands with Mr Papandreou at the Federation of German Industry last night, where the Greek PM called for more investment in his country . Stocks improved following last week's turmoil as speculation grew that Greece's bailout creditors would look to impose bigger losses on the country's private bondholders, as well as recapitalise Europe's banks and expand the eurozone's rescue fund. Japan's Nikkei index rose 0.2 per cent to 8,625.40, while the Dow Jones rose 1.3 per cent to close at 11,190.69. Britain's FTSE initially fell this morning, but had climbed another 1.3% by lunchtime after a 4 per cent rise last night. So far, there has been no confirmation from Europe's capitals that such a comprehensive solution is being planned. Financial markets closely watched the meeting between Ms Merkel and Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, but neither announced any new measures ahead of their private dinner at Berlin's chancellery. 'Through the euro, we are closely bound together, and the weakness of one affects us all,' Ms Merkel said at a news conference. Germany, Europe's biggest economy, is seen as a key player in resolving the 17-nation eurozone's debt crisis, but Ms Merkel's government has repeatedly been accused over the past 18 months of being a reluctant leader of the rescue efforts. Public anger: Protesters in Athens put up a set of gallows in Syntagma Square after a deeply unpopular property tax was passed yesterday . Backlash: A protester confronts riot police in front of the Greek Parliament in Athens. The riot dog - which has appeared in many austerity protests in the capital - stands in front of them . Speaking yesterday alongside economy minister Philip Roesler, Ms Merkel reiterated her conviction that there was no quick solution and the crisis must be dealt with 'step by step'. Greece must receive a £7billion rescue loan before mid-October to stave off bankruptcy, a collapse that would send shock waves through markets around the world. But creditors have demanded more efforts to raise revenue. In response, Greek MPs approved a controversial new property tax last night, passing it 154-143 in the 300-member parliament. The levy, in addition to public-sector reforms announced earlier, is expected to make up for lagging revenues this year by providing more than €billion, or about 1 per cent of Greece's gross domestic product. Greek finance minister Evangelos Venizelos said his country would get the money. 'The disbursement will be decided in time, in line with the course of our funding needs,' he said. Violence: An injured protester is given first aid in Athens after clashes with riot police last night . Picking up: A trader works on the floor of New York Stock Exchange last night. Stocks around the world rose after the Greek parliament passed the property tax . German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told members of her own party that Greece might go bust before Christmas. Ahead of today's crucial vote in the German parliament seeking to boost the bailout fund for Athens the country's biggest newspaper claims Ms Merkel told MPs of her conservative party:  'We are trying to avoid an insolvency of Greece. I cannot, however, exclude it.' The paper questioned whether the kiss she gave to Greek premier Giorgos Papandreou when he arrived in Berlin yesterday begging for help was in fact a farewell smacker 'for Greece in the eurozone'. No fresh details emerged after the pair dined together late last night, no silver bullet solution was offered to world markets, financiers, taxpayers and economists who have all been begging for leadership to end the crisis which has been dragging on now for 18 months. Bild says it has information that numerous members of Ms Merkel's coalition government believe Greece will be bankrupt before Christmas. But a multi-billion euro top-up to the bailout fund to stave off disaster will likely be approved by lawmakers in Berlin tomorrow. The vote, however, could prove to be the death knell for the German government. At least 11 members of Ms Merkel CDU and CSU conservative parties are threatening to revolt along with MPs in the Liberal FDP party which is the junior coalition party. It means she relies on the support of the opposition to pass the measure and leaves her weakened, exposed and vulnerable to a leadership challenge. If Bild is correct in reporting her comments, the electorate will not take kindly to throwing more money at Greece when there is no guarantee it will have any effect at all. Der Spiegel magazine says the size of her own parties' revolt against her tomorrow will determine her future. It said: 'It would trigger opposition calls for her to step down or seek an early election. 'She would likely resist both options, but her scope to take bold new steps to contain the crisis with fresh German guarantees would be seriously curtailed.' Tomorrow the Bundestag will vote on whether to increase the powers of the EFSF – the forerunner of the permanent rescue facility, the European Stability Mechanism, due to come into force in 2013. Greeks have been outraged by tax and . other austerity measures, and unions have responded with strikes and . protests. Even as Mr Venizelos spoke, protesting ministry employees and . tax office workers chanted outside his department in Athens. Mr . Venizelos said Greece had made great efforts to achieve its fiscal . targets, but that a 'hyper-effort' was necessary to fully meet its . commitments. He said . representatives from the International Monetary Fund, the European . Commission and the European Central Bank would return to Athens this . week. The so-called troika suspended its review in early September amid talk of missed targets and budget shortfalls. The current plan is to have Greece implement painful debt-reduction measures in exchange for rescue loans. Greece relies on funds from last year's €110billion (£95.5 billion) package, and European leaders also have agreed on a second €109billion bailout, although some details of that remain to be worked out. 'We want a strong Greece within the eurozone, and Germany is prepared to offer all necessary assistance,' Ms Merkel said in Berlin. Mr Papandreou, in return, pledged to implement the reforms demanded by Greece's international creditors. He said this was a time 'of great sacrifices for the Greek people. Therefore it is of great importance to receive signals of support from our European partners'. Before the meeting between the two leaders, Ms Merkel's government downplayed speculation of bold new moves to tackle Europe's sprawling sovereign debt crisis. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble ruled out increasing the eurozone's new €440billion (£382bn) rescue fund, calling it 'a silly idea' that could ultimately endanger the AAA ratings of the main creditor countries such as Germany and the Netherlands. Greece's new property tax will range from four to 20 euro for every square metre in residential properties. It will be charged through electricity bills to make it easier for the state to collect, instead of going through Greece's unwieldy and inefficient tax system. Those who refuse to pay will risk having their power cut off. The extra charge has deeply angered Greeks, who have already been through more than a year of sharp austerity measures, including salary and pension cuts and higher taxes. State electricity company unionists have threatened not to collect the tax. Public transport workers walked off the job for two days yesterday, and were to be joined by taxi drivers today. Tax office and customs workers were also on strike. Police briefly scuffled with protesters outside parliament shortly after yesterday's vote and used pepper spray to disperse one group of youths.","Japan's Nikkei index up 0.2% and Dow Jones closes up 1.3% .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:34 AM on 28th September 2011 . A former forklift truck driver is set to retire two years early after undergoing a sex-change operation. Lizi Ninnim, who was born Roger, qualifies for early retirement since she became a woman 12 months ago. But she says: 'I wouldn't recommend it as an easy route to an early pension - it would make your eyes water.' I'm off: Lizi Ninnim, left, at her retirement party - which has come two years early after she underwent a sex change . Six-foot Lizi, of Clacton, Essex, had counselling and lived as a woman for four years before the sex-change op. Now her birth certificate has been legally changed to say she was born female. The ruling means Lizi, 63, can retire two years earlier than if she were still a man. Lizi consulted her workmates at the Range furniture store before the sex change, and every member of staff backed the move. She said: 'I went to work one day as a male, had the weekend off, and on Monday I went in as a woman. The old Roger even had a leaving bash. 'They bought me a present saying goodbye to Roger and had a leaving do for him. Then on the Monday they had a welcome party for Lizi.' Forklift: Lizi has left her old life as Roger behind (file photo) Although she describes Clacton as 'not the most understanding town', she says customers at the shop where she is now a manager have accepted her. 'It doesn't bother me if people make comments,' she added. 'I've never regretted what I've done.

Parents of children taught by the teacher forced to move away from his family over unfounded sex allegations have branded his treatment ‘disgusting’. They insisted yesterday that Peter Wilson, who was acquitted of touching girls in his primary school class, and his wife Clare were excellent teachers. The 35-year-old remains suspended from the classroom – as does Mrs Wilson, 29, simply for being married to him. One father said: ‘Mr Wilson is a great teacher. ‘He’s taught two of my kids and they thought he was great. He’s very friendly – but that’s his style of teaching. It’s all been blown out of proportion. ‘You don’t get many young male teachers in primary schools and I hope we see him back here soon.’ An unnamed mother said: ‘It’s shocking that they wouldn’t let him live with Clare and their son. I think what social services did is disgusting, he’ll never get those first few months back. ‘I just hope they can put it all behind them now and start to rebuild their lives.’ Another woman with children at the school added: ‘It’s fantastic that Mr Wilson has been cleared. ‘We never thought he was guilty of anything, but we don’t understand why he’s still suspended. Anguish: Mr Wilson, pictured with a woman believed to be his wife Clare, leave court after an earlier hearing . ‘Also, it’s really unfair that Clare was suspended too. It didn’t have anything to do with her. ‘She’s a lovely, lovely woman and she’s really missed in reception where she teaches.’ Mr Wilson was suspended from the . school in Blackpool – which cannot be named for legal reasons – last . year after young girls accused him of kissing them and patting them on . the bottom. He insisted he had simply been trying . to encourage pupils with a clasp of the shoulder, a hug or a pat on the . back, and said the  allegations that his actions were sexually motivated . were ‘probably malicious’. Cleared: It took a jury just 20 minutes to acquit Mr Wilson at Preston Crown Court (pictured) While Mr Wilson was awaiting trial . earlier this year, his wife gave birth to their first child and social . services made him agree not to live with them for eight months. After he was acquitted on Monday of indecently assaulting five girls, the teacher spoke emotionally about his ‘horrible ordeal’. However, neither Mr Wilson nor his . wife is likely to return to the classroom for many months. Blackpool . council has only now launched an investigation and both teachers remain . suspended while it is carried out. It has refused to rule out referring . Mr Wilson to the General Teaching Council, which could launch . disciplinary action against him.

A KBR contract worker who claims she was drugged and brutally raped while working in Iraq has been ordered to pay $145,000 of the company's court costs after she lost her lawsuit. A federal jury in Houston ruled against Jamie Leigh Jones after her civil trial in July. KBR had asked U.S. District Judge Keith Ellison to award $2million in legal fees and court costs against Miss Jones, but Ellison approved only the court costs on Monday. Ordeal: Jamie Leigh Jones answers a question as her husband, Kallan Daigle, (R) and attorney, Todd Kelly, stand with her outside the courthouse on June 14 . The Houston Chronicle reports Ellison ruled that while Miss Jones' lawsuit was flawed, it was not frivolous as KBR alleged. Miss Jones' attorney, Todd Jones of Houston, had not returned requests for comment at press time. He had previously called KBR's request 'shameful'. It was almost six years after the . event that Miss Jones told jurors she was 'scared to death' and held . against her will by her employer after being sexually assaulted in Iraq . at the hands of co-workers. The 26-year-old, from Texas, is . one of several female contract workers for KBR and its former parent . Halliburton Co who claim they were sexually assaulted or harassed while . working for the companies in Iraq. Miss Jones said that while she was . a clerical worker at Camp Hope in Baghdad in 2005, she was raped so . violently her breast implants were ruptured, her pectoral muscles were . torn and she was severely bruised. Brutal: Jamie Leigh Jones, who claimed she was drugged and raped by her co-workers in Iraq outside the federal courthouse on June 14 . When she reported the rape to KBR . officials, she said they placed her under armed guard, held her in a . shipping container for hours and wouldn't allow her to make a phone . call. She claims she eventually managed . to escape the ordeal by convincing one of the guards to let her use his . phone, which she used to call her father in the United States. After the ordeal she had to have two breast operations and hundreds of sessions with a psychiatrist, according to her testimony. Accused: Charles Bortz was accused of carrying out the sex attack on Jamie Leigh Jones in Iraq in 2005 . In court, Miss Jones said her . chest was so disfigured after the incident she needed two reconstructive . breast operations - with the first unsuccessful. She became depressed after the attack and developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, she said. 'I was excited to get the memory . of Baghdad off of me,' Jones said of the plastic surgery. 'Yes, I could . cover it up (with clothing)… but why do I have to be constantly reminded . of it?' Miss Jones sued KBR, Halliburton and a former KBR firefighter she says was one of her rapists, all of whom deny her allegations. During her often tearful . testimony, Miss Jones said she had been drinking with a group of KBR . firefighters outside her barracks before she was raped. 'One of the firefighters, he . handed me the drink. He said: ""Don't worry I saved all the ruffies for . Dubai,""' Miss Jones testified. She said she was drugged with what . she believes was the sedative Rohypnol, widely known as a date-rape . drug and also known by the nickname 'ruffies'. On duty: Jamie Leigh Jones was a clerical worker in Camp Hope, Baghdad, when she was allegedly raped during U.S. military operations . Miss Jones said she woke up the . next morning in her room and discovered she was naked, sore and had . bruises and scratches on her thighs and wrists. She said he had no memory of what . happened to her. She said she found Charles Bortz in the room with her . and he told her that they had had sex the night before. 'I was putting the pieces together. I was figuring it out. I knew I had been raped,' Miss Jones said. According to the lawsuit: 'When . she awoke the next morning still affected by the drug, she found her . body naked and severely bruised, with lacerations, blood running down . her leg, her breast implants ruptured, and her pectoral muscles torn – . which would later require reconstructive surgery.' Miss Jones told jurors that after . getting dressed and reporting for work, she realised what had happened . to her and had a friend take her to get medical treatment. After being examined by a military . doctor, several KBR officials were crass towards her and tried to bully . her into giving a statement about what happened, she claimed. Her account was confirmed by U.S. Army physician Jodi Schultz, who gave the rape kit she used to gather . evidence from Miss Jones to KBR security forces. The rape kit later disappeared and . was recovered two years later, but missing crucial photographs and . notes, according to the Guardian. Jones said she eventually . contacted her father, who called U.S. Representative Ted Poe, R-Texas, . who helped to secure her release. KBR and Halliburton had contended . Miss Jones' case should be settled through arbitration as stipulated in . her contract. But an appeals court let her lawsuit go to trial. Due in part to Miss Jones' case, . federal lawmakers in 2009 approved a measure prohibiting contractors and . subcontractors that receive $1million in funds from the Department of . Defense from requiring employees to resolve sexual assault allegations . and other claims through arbitration.","KBR asked judge for $2million in legal fees and court costs .

Snow and gale force winds have brought the country to a standstill during what forecasters are describing as a once-in-a-lifetime event.

Heavy snowfalls blanketed large parts of the city of Christchurch, New Zealand, this morning after the country was hit by a rare weather front from the Antarctic .

Residents in the hillside suburbs of the capital city of Wellington were told they faced being snowed in after they were hit with the heaviest blanketing in at least 30 years. Civil defence chief Rian Van Schalkwyk warned: 'People should prepare for the worst, which means making sure they're reading in the event that they cannot leave home and may be without electricity and other amenities.' A blanket of snow covers the city of Christchurch (left), while a teenager skids through the ice in the Wellington suburb of Johnsonville (right) Mail delivery in many towns was disrupted, and many schools, libraries and swimming pools were closed.

Four-wheel drive emergency vehicles and a snow plough were scrambled after more than 100 people were trapped in their cars on a road over the Rimutaka Hills, north of Wellington. In Auckland, four people were taken to hospital after heavy winds caused a tree to crash into their home. WeatherWatch service forecaster Philip Duncan told the New Zealand Herald: 'I've been watching the weather closely for about 15 years and I've never seen a prediction like this.' He said the freezing conditions were due to a large high-pressure system reaching from Antarctica to the sub-tropics, which had merged with three neighbouring low-pressure systems. Although Auckland had its heaviest snowfall since the 1970s, much of it was washed away by heavy rain. Mr Duncan added: 'Aucklanders won't have white-out conditions like Wellington, Christchurch or Dunedin but certainly a few isolated pockets of snow are likely mixed with the rain. MetService forecaster Peter Kreft told NZPA the freezing conditions were 'a once in many decades event' and suggested the country had not experienced anything like it for half a century. He said: 'We are probably looking at something like - in terms of extent and severity - maybe 50 years.' Meanwhile, Stephen Fry, who is in Wellington filming The Hobbit, described the atmosphere on Twitter. He Tweeted: 'It's been an exciting day here in Wellington. Snow. That's unusual.

He said: 'I can't personally recall seeing snow in downtown Wellington.

A newsreader was sacked today after he repeatedly swore during an astonishing on-air rant. South African radio presenter Mark Esterhuysen, 23, was dismissed after using the F-word 13 times during an angry and incoherent outburst which was broadcast live. The news presenter started his hourly bulletin at 1am this morning in Johannesburg by introducing himself as normal before beginning his furious tirade. During the 40-second rant he repeatedly swore as he directed his ire at various targets including a group of police officers accused of murdering a member of the public, firebrand politician Julius Malema and the country's right-wing Afrikaner AWB party. Esterhuysen then expressed anger about being stuck on his network's overnight 'graveyard shift' before inviting listeners to follow his blog and then storming out of the studio. During the incredible rant he said: 'Good morning, I'm Mark Esterhuysen.F*** racism. F*** the pigs who killed Andries Tatane. F*** the AWB. F*** racism. We are all wild animals meant to live free. 'F*** capitalism. F*** fascism. F*** this f***ing wage slavery graveyard shit. 'F*** domestication. F*** Malema. F*** the state. F*** the petrol economic growth on a finite planet. 'This is the only f***ing planet we have.' As producers switched on some background music in the hope of drowning out the outburst, he added: ""If you don't agree with me please see my blog. 'Peace, love, respect, anarchy. 'Follow me on Twitter. You can see me on Facebook as well.' Esterhuysen's employers at the Johannesburg-based 702 Talk Radio station today confirmed he had been fired following the outburst. The presenter had worked for the nationally-broadcast Eyewitness News network for around four months after starting his career in student radio. In a statement the channel apologised to listeners for the foul-mouthed rant. The statement said: ""Eyewitness News and Talk Radio 702 apologise to our listeners for the comments made during what was supposed to be the news bulletin at 1am this morning. ""EWN does not condone what the news anchor Mark Esterhuysen said at this time instead of reading the news. ""Mark's contract with EWN has been terminated with immediate effect and once again, we apologise to our listeners."" Esterhuysen was today unavailable for comment about the incident. On his profile on Twitter the broadcaster describes himself as an 'enemy of the state' and a 'defender of anarchy'. His reference during his rant to the death of Andries Tatane followed the black teacher's death during a protest in April. The incident sparked a public outcry in South Africa after footage was broadcast on national television which showed Tatane being savagely beaten by police.

Trying desperately to salvage . anything that remains of his personal belongings, a man hangs from the . shattered remnants of his waterfront home in the coastal village of Navotas, north of Manila in the Philippines. And, while it might not be immediately obvious, he is one of the lucky ones. Typhoon Nesat totally wiped away most . of his neighbours' homes as it ravaged the northern Philippines . yesterday, with sustained wind speeds reaching more than 120mph, and . rain producing the worst flooding in decades. Blown away: A Filipino man hangs from the floor of his waterfront home in Navotas, north of Manila. Typhoon Nesat destroyed homes in the coastal village, and left 35 dead and a further 45 missing across the country . Nesat left death and destruction in its wake, with 41 dead and scores more injured. A further 45 people remain missing. Now residents of southern China are . bracing for impact as Nesat bears down upon them and promises a rough . ride today and tonight. Floodwaters were receding in most . places, and emergency services had restored electricity in many places . that experienced power cuts. But low-lying communities . in the north remained in crisis. Rescue: A Filipino emergency services member carries a baby to safety as a family is evacuated from their flooded home in Isabela province. Many other victims remain stranded on the roofs of their homes as rescuers struggle to reach them . Chest deep: The worst flooding in decades has brought havoc to the Philippines. The death toll has risen today from 35 to 41, and many more remain missing . Mayor Santiago Austria, of the rice-farming town of Jaen in Nueva Ecija . province, said: 'Many people here are still on top of their houses. We don't have enough . boats to reach them and hand them food.' In all, nearly 500,000 people were affected by the typhoon in the Philippines, of which about 170,000 were forced to flee their . homes and were in various evacuation centres. Meanwhile, a new tropical storm was brewing in the Pacific, Philippine . government forecaster Bobby Javier said. Bearing down: Palm trees show the severity of sustained winds in Sanya, in south China's Hainan province. Despite bypassing Hong Kong, the typhoon caused flight diversions, a suspension of the stock exchange and closures of schools and businesses . Storm damage: No fatalities have yet been reported in China, but high . winds have brought down trees and power lines, causing damage . and widespread power cuts . He added that Tropical Storm Nalgae already had . sustained winds of 52mph and gusts up to 62mph, and . was expected to strengthen significantly before hitting major parts of . the country in the next few days. The typhoon made landfall on the eastern tip of China's Hainan island, closing schools, suspending ferry services and forcing fishing boats into safe shelter. In Hong Kong, the stock market suspended trading, and shops and businesses closed fearful that it would strike land there. The Asian financial centre's normally bustling streets were eerily quiet, with few people venturing outside to brave the rain and fierce winds. Double trouble: A satellite image shows Typhoon Nesat to the west in the South China Sea, and Tropical Storm Nalgae strengthening to the east. Nalgae is expected to hit Philippines in the next few days . At Hong Kong's airport, 245 flights were delayed, 20 were cancelled and 22 diverted to other airports. Yet the typhoon did not hit Hong Kong directly, coming within 220 miles before moving away, the Hong Kong Observatory said. Nevertheless two people were injured when bamboo . scaffolding was blown over and collapsed onto a taxi, while another man was . injured by a falling tree.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:53 PM on 28th September 2011 . Experts speculate that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie could still launch a presidential run - despite a series of apparent denials. Vaguely answering a supporter who pleaded with him to enter the race at an event in Simi Valley, California, last night he said, 'I thank you for what you're saying, and I take it in and I'm listening . to every word of it and feeling it too.' Critics say that is not a direct no and he could still launch a dramatic last minute bid for the White House. Impassioned: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie speaks during the Perspectives on Leadership Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California on Tuesday . Speaking before a crowd of 1,000, . including former First Lady Nancy Reagan, at the Ronald Reagan . Presidential Library, a supporter pleaded with the impassioned governor . to battle for the Republican nomination. 'Don't even say anything tonight, go . home and think about it. Do it for my daughter, do it for our . grandchildren, do it for our sons, please sir: we need you. Your country . needs you as president,' the supporter cried out from the crowd. Should Chris Christie run for President? Christie didn't say no, but pointed . listeners to a video clip on Politico.com which had pieced together a . long string of video clips of him saying he's not a candidate for the . White House. 'Those are the answers,' he told the crowd. Nonetheless, the speech - delivered at . a shrine to America's 40th president - was likely to stoke fresh . speculation about his presidential ambitions. 'I hear exactly what you are saying and I feel the passion with which you say it,' Christie added. 'And so my answer to you is just this: . I thank you for what you're saying, and I take it in and I'm listening . to every word of it and feeling it too,' he said. The Republican governor warned that . the nation's credibility abroad was being damaged by troubles at home. He charged that an indecisive White House has deepened the nation's . economic pain, and he accused President Obama of preparing to divide the . country to win re-election next year. Candid: Former first lady Nancy Reagan (L) and Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (R) sit together before Christie's speech . Helping hand: Former first lady Nancy Reagan (2nd R) is escorted by Christie (R) as former California Governor Pete Wilson (L) and wife Gayle Wilson (2nd L) look on . Christie didn't spare Congress: In a . scathing indictment of Beltway politics, he said the failure to . compromise, along with Obama's lack of leadership, had set the country . dangerously off course. In Washington 'we drift from conflict . to conflict, with little or no resolution. We watch a president who once . talked about the courage of his convictions, but still has yet found . the courage to lead,' Christie said. 'We watch a Congress at war with . itself because they are unwilling to leave campaign-style politics at . the Capitol's door. The result is a debt-ceiling limitation debate that . made our democracy appear as if we could no longer effectively govern . ourselves,' he said. Christie's appearance came during a . three-day national trip in which the governor is raising money for . Republicans and networking with party rainmakers. With a reputation as a blunt-talking . budget-cutter, the Reagan stage gave Christie the opportunity to extend . his influence in a party that views him as a rising star. His remarks . could stoke a fresh round of speculation about his White House . ambitions, but his brother was the latest confidante to tamp down talk . of a presidential bid. Family: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is pictured with his wife Mary, fifth from left, and children at a 9/11 memorial dedication in Jersey City, New Jersey . Second in command: New Jersey Lt Governor Kim Guadagno, left, who's serving as acting governor in Chris Christie's absence, says she's not looking to take 'acting' off her title anytime soon . 'I'm sure that he's not going to run,' Todd Christie told The Star-Ledger of Newark, New Jersey. The newspaper . also reported that the governor told wealthy donors earlier on Tuesday . in Santa Ana that he was not entering the race, echoing his previous . statements. Christie, the first Republican elected . New Jersey governor since 1997, repeatedly contrasted Reagan's . leadership skills with the dysfunction in Washington. Obama has . positioned himself as a compromiser and deal-maker, but Christie cited . his work in Trenton as the successful model, saying 'leadership and . compromise is the only way you reform New Jersey's pension and health . benefits system.' He mocked Obama as 'a bystander in the . Oval Office' who was preparing to divide the nation along economic . lines to win another four years in Washington, apparently alluding to . the president's jobs bill, which proposes that wealthy Americans and big . corporations pay more in taxes. Obama is 'telling those who are scared . and struggling that the only way their lives can get better is to . diminish the success of others,' Christie said. He's 'insisting that we . must tax and take and demonize those who have already achieved the . American Dream.' Not interested: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie toured the devastation of Hurricane Irene with President Obama last month . After the speech, Christie was asked . repeatedly during a question-and-answer session if he would reconsider a . presidential run. He declined, as he has many times before.

"By . Sean Poulter . Last updated at 2:02 AM on 28th September 2011 . Families are typically £728 a year worse off than 12 months ago, a study showed yesterday. The decline – more severe than during the 2008 recession – comes amid warnings that the cost of living squeeze is about to get worse. The monthly Asda Income Tracker claims ‘families have never had it so tough’ with a 7.9 per cent fall in average household discretionary spending. This means that after covering must-pay bills for food, heat, light, and the mortgage or rent, the average family is left with just £162 a week for everything else. The figures are a further blow to claims that the economy is in recovery and come at the same time as British supermarkets launch a vicious price war to capture customers' diminishing spending . Asda's Income Tracker found that the average family now has £162 disposable income per week, a 7.9 per cent fall since last year . For someone on average earnings, the £14 a week fall equates to a pay cut of around £1,000 a year. The figures are the worst in the . four-year history of the study, while the current cost of living squeeze . is said to be the longest and deepest for at least 60 years. Two other studies confirm the . situation has profound consequences for families and the wider economy. The Prudential found one third of those with a company pension scheme . have stopped making contributions because they cannot afford them, so . threatening poverty in old age. Price cuts: Tesco has slashed 3,000 prices to appeal to cash-strapped consumers . And the CBI said high street sales are down on this time last year, which could push some retailers over the edge. The Asda study found nine in ten of . us say things are tougher now than they were this time last year. Customers say utilities and fuel costs are the biggest pressure on . income. The official CPI measure of inflation . rose from 4.4 per cent in July to 4.5 per cent in August. These . increases are way ahead of an average 2 per cent rise in incomes and . pensions in the past year, which means Britons are getting poorer by the . week. Asda offered some relief to consumers . by announcing a 2p a litre cut in the price of petrol and diesel. It . was immediately followed by Tesco and Morrisons. Sainsbury’s said it was cutting fuel prices at many stores by ‘up to’ 2p per litre. Asda’s fuel price cut means there . will be a national price cap across all its 188 petrol stations of . 130.7p a litre for unleaded and 135.7 for diesel. The income tracker is compiled in . partnership with the Centre for Economics and Business Research, whose . managing economist, Charles Davis, warned there may be worse to come. ‘Rising unemployment has added further pressure to household finances in . recent months, compounding the squeeze on spending power caused by high . inflation and weak earnings growth,’ he said. ‘Family spending power has fallen . sharply compared with a year ago. With the UK economy in a particularly . precarious state at the moment, things could get worse before they get . better.’ Asda asked customers what the . Government should do to help people. Four in five said action to put . money into people’s pockets should be top of the agenda. Two in five . wanted a freeze on energy bills and a quarter wanted a cut in fuel duty.",'It's clear from this record drop in disposable income that British families have never had it so tough'
"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 7:59 AM on 30th September 2011 . A rare white humpback whale calf has been spotted near Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Believed to be just a few weeks old, the 12ft calf was seen at Cid Harbour in the famous reef's Whitsunday Islands area by a family out in the bay in their boat. White whales are highly unusual, with only 10 to 15 believed to exist among up to 15,000 living along Australia's east coast. A white spectacle: A rare pure white humpback whale has been spotted off the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. There are only 10 to 15 in the 15,000-strong humpback population along the east coast of Australia . Wayne Fewings was diving in the harbour when he spotted the animal surfacing and described the sighting as a 'once in a lifetime experience'. He said: 'We were just drifting when I noticed the smaller whale in the pod was white. I couldn't believe my eyes. 'Then the white calf approached my boat, seeming to want to check us out. I was just so amazed at seeing this animal, it made me think how truly astounding the Great Barrier Reef is.' The calf's parents may both have been dark humpbacks carrying a recessive white whale gene, but Great Barrier Reef official Mark Read said one may also have been white themselves. That raises speculation that the calf could be the offspring of famous white humpback Migaloo. Migaloo - the name is an Aboriginal word meaning 'whitefella' - is the world's best-known all-white humpback and has built up a loyal following in Australia since first being sighted in 1991. Has he got a famous dad? This picture shows Migaloo - Aboriginal for 'whitefella' - another pure white whale that been spotted off Australia since 1991. The calf may be related . Mr Read said it was impossible to speculate on the baby humpback's parentage without genetic tests to compare with samples taken from Migaloo. 'There is another couple of purely white whales and then there's a very, very low number of animals that are a sort of blotchy colour,' he said. 'It is pretty unusual, but we'd be purely speculating in terms of relationships to Migaloo.' Humpback whales are currently on their southern migration, and the baby will be feeding heavily from its mother as it lays down fat stores for the 'cold Antarctic waters'. Its sex was unknown and Mr Read said there were no plans to give the young mammal a name of its own. Australia's east coast humpback population has been brought back from the brink of extinction following the halting of whaling in the early 1960s. Migaloo was last officially sighted by a cargo ship crew on August 10 around 6 miles north of Pipon Island, in far north Queensland, according to the White Whale Research Centre.","Only 10 to 15 believed to exist among 15,000 humpback whales living along Australia's east coast .

"By . Nick Pisa . Last updated at 2:50 PM on 30th September 2011 . A prosecutor in the Amanda Knox appeal who has been convicted of abuse of office today asked the court not to be 'believe in fairy tales' as he rebutted defence arguments in the case which is nearing its tense climax. Giuliano Mignini, who bizarrely has been allowed to continue as a prosecutor despite his 16 month suspended sentence, added it was time the 'tragic case was dealt with serenity and rationality' - comments that had Knox's family and supporters raising their eyebrows. They have questioned how he can be involved in the case after he was found guilty in early 2010 of exceeding his powers by tapping the phones of police officers and journalists investigating the still unsolved 'Monster of Florence' serial killings between 1968 and 1985. A prosecutor in the Amanda Knox (pictured) appeal has been convicted of abuse of office today. He rebutted defence arguments in the case which is nearing a tension filled climax . Knox, 24, was convicted in 2009 of the brutal sex murder of student Meredith Kercher, 21, who was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house they shared. Initially Mr Mignini had insisted the murder was a Satantic ritual, then it was a botched burglary after a sex game had gone tragically wrong before finally deciding it was simply a 'motiveless killing and as such both accused deserve life'. Giuliano Mignini has been allowed to continue as a prosecutor despite his 16 month suspended sentence for tapping phones in a previous case . In the first trial Knox and her co accused, her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 27, were sentenced to 26 years and 25 years respectively but both have insisted they had nothing to do with the murder and are appealing their convictions. Mr Mignini hit back at defence claims that Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede, who has already been found guilty of murder, was the sole culprit insisting that evidence showed all three knew each other well. Mr Mignini told the court: 'Rudy . Guede is the only person responsible for this murder they say - well we . don't believe in fairy tales and you should not believe in fairy tales . either.'These two little . love birds have built up a pact of steel to defend themselves,' before . adding that Sollecito at the beginning had told prosecutors he could not . remember if Knox had spent the night with him before changing his story . again and insisting they had been together. Mr Mignini also highlighted how earlier in the week when graphic photographs of Meredith's lifeless body were shown in court Knox and Sollecito had looked away while the public gallery gasped in shock. Mr Mignini told the court that the idea that Rudy . Guede (left) is the only person responsible for Meredith Kercher's murder (right) is a fairy tale . He said: 'Never, ever have the accused looked at the photographs of poor Meredith's body - I saw that poor girl with my own eyes.'But Amanda never looked at them once not now or even during the first trial, she kept her head down while Raffaele looked away to the other side of the room.'Mr Mignini also hit back at the defence claims that Knox had been 'crucified by the media' saying: 'I have never heard of an accused hiring a potent PR machine, offers of a million dollars and private jets at the ready to whisk her away overseas if she is cleared.'He was referring to suggestions in the Italian media that the three main American TV networks have put in astronomical bids to secure the first interview with Knox and are willing to fly her and her family back to the United States in a private jet. Key to their original conviction was a . 30cm kitchen knife found in Sollecito's apartment and on which DNA from . Meredith was said to be on the blade and that of Knox on the handle.However . a court ordered independent report has said that the DNA from Meredith . was so low it should be deemed unsafe and could not even be retested - . although they confirmed it was Knox's on the handle but her lawyers . pointed out she had used it for cooking. Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann is conducting the Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito appeal hearing. It is expected to end on Monday when the judge and his jury of five women and one man will retire to consider their verdict . The report also dismissed a clasp from Meredith's bloody bra and on which DNA from Sollecito was found - 46 days after it had been found and then lost by the forensic team with the report saying there was a high risk of contamination because it had been left so long.Meredith, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was in Perugia as part of her Leeds University and had only been in Italy for two months before she was brutally murdered and Knox and Sollecito were jailed in December 2009.Guede was handed a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual violence following a fast-track trial in October 2008 which was later cut to 16 years. The trial is expected to end on Monday when judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman and his jury of five women and one man will retire to consider their verdict.",Giuliano Mignini added it was time the 'tragic case was dealt with serenity and rationality'
"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 6:32 PM on 30th September 2011 . A couple who prayed and rubbed olive oil on their sick infant rather than calling 911 for the dying boy have been found guilty of manslaughter. Dale and Shannon Hickman, both 26, are the latest members of a controversial Oregon faith-healing church to be blamed in a child's death. Their baby David was born two months early at his grandmother's home and died nine hours later when he had trouble breathing and turned blue. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Dale and Shannon Hickman react after receiving guilty verdicts at their manslaughter trial at Clackamas County Circuit Court in Oregon City, Oregon . They cried and hugged tightly after being found guilty following jury deliberations of less than four hours, reported The Oregonian. David was born with a bacterial infection and underdeveloped lungs and had a 99 per cent chance of survival with medical care, prosecutors said. Mr Hickman said he didn't call 911 because he was praying. The couple never considered taking the baby to the hospital, prosecutors said. Shannon Hickman said that she must defer to her husband because of church rules. ‘I think it's God's will whatever happens,’ she testified. Dead: Their baby David was born two months early at his grandmother's home and died nine hours later when he had trouble breathing and turned blue . But the couple are only expected to . be jailed for up to 18 months and their defence lawyer said they were . victims of religious persecution. The Followers of Christ church was founded in the 1890s in Kansas but moved to Oregon City in the 1940s. The . devout followers firmly believe that the power of prayer and the laying . of hands - where ministers lay their hands on believers while . praying - can cure illnesses. It’s . thought that some followers secretly visit traditional doctors - but if . found out, they are likely to find themselves ostracised. The . baby boy died quickly and there was no evidence that medical care would . have saved him, Mark Cogan, defending, told the court. The Followers of Christ Church has a history of rejecting medical care for children and relying on as prayer and anointing the sick with oils. Five other church members have been . convicted in Clackamas County for crimes related to the rejection of . medical care for their children. The Hickmans' conviction on . second-degree manslaughter charges typically requires a mandatory . minimum sentence of six years in prison. Under-fire: The Followers of Christ Church has a history of rejecting medical care for children and relying on as prayer and anointing the sick with oils . But because of a religious exemption in . state law at time of the crime, they will probably get up to 18 months . in prison and a $250,000 fine. 'I think it's God's will whatever happens' Shannon Hickman . Clackamas County Circuit Court Judge Robert Herndon allowed the couple to remain free until they are sentenced at the end of October. In response to deaths among Followers of Christ members, state lawmakers removed the religious defences from criminal laws this year. Those exemptions had made it tougher to . convict parents shunning a child's medical care for religious reasons . instead of neglect. Hickmans: Five other church members have been convicted in Clackamas County for crimes related to the rejection of medical care for their children . Mugshots: Shannon and Dale Hickman . were convicted in court of manslaughter . The change will allow prosecutors to seek stiffer manslaughter or murder charges in faith-healing cases. Two other parents from the church were convicted earlier this year for failing to seek medical care for their infant daughter. She had a growth that could have left her blind in one eye - and they were sentenced to three months in jail. See video here .","Dale and Shannon Hickman found guilty on Thursday .

"By . Francesca Polini . Last updated at 7:57 AM on 30th September 2011 . Twice, my husband and I have tried to adopt children through our local authority. Twice, the over-bureaucratic, ideologically-twisted local authority has stood in our way. Eventually, we had to travel halfway around the world, to Mexico, where  thanks to a far more efficient, orderly, sane system we now have a beautiful three-year-old daughter, Gaia, and one-year-old son, Luca. The adoption system in Britain is a mess. The average child will wait two years and seven months to be adopted and during that time they will be bounced around the system while their birth mother – often addicted to drugs or alcohol – continues to neglect them. Against the odds: Francesca Polini with three-year-old Gaia, left, and Luca, six months . At the same time, the desperate adoptive parents are forced to jump through every hoop the local authority asks them to. One of the most pernicious ideas in current thinking is that children should be placed with parents who exactly match their racial make-up. I am white and Italian – although I have lived in Britain for 16 years – and my husband is white and British. Our local authority, Ealing in West London, rejected our application immediately without even seeing us in the flesh. Apparently they deemed we were too white and middle class. Although we are medically able to have children, we chose to adopt. I have an adopted younger brother and I have seen at first hand the wonderful benefits of adoption. We were a perfectly ordinary, decent, suburban couple hoping to provide a child with a loving home. Farcical: The Government tried to lay down new guidelines covering 'transracial' adoptions . We were both in full-time employment: my husband Rick is an ex-banker who works for an energy company and I used to be global communications director for Greenpeace. We didn’t even smoke – often a problem for prospective adoptive parents. But we were treated like criminals. We were presumed guilty until proven innocent. The local authorities will talk to your parents and your relatives, get bank references and work references. It’s extraordinary – why would we be prepared to go through all this if we didn’t want to be good parents? It was extremely frustrating and invasive. We already owned our own home but we had to renovate it in order to satisfy the local council even before the process of being approved for adoption had begun. After they had rejected us, Ealing even admitted they had a cap on the number of white parents who could adopt black children and in a farcical twist, after denying us the chance to adopt a non-white child from the same postcode, they suggested we adopt abroad. Mexico was a bit of a roll of the dice, chosen partly because I could speak Spanish. The Mexican end of the process was wonderfully efficient. Our caseworker met us within a week, and talked us through the process. 'We were accused of being child traffickers' The authorities were a  hundred times more caring  than in Britain. Here, . we never once met our caseworker at the Department for Education. Whenever we sent them an email, we got an automated email response, . saying we couldn’t contact them; they’d have to contact us. The only problem in adopting Gaia came from the British end. It was a shambles every step of the way. We were approved by our local authority and the Department for Education before going to Mexico. But once we got to Mexico, the British Department for Education lost our papers, and we had to wait three and a half months for them to post the documents to us. Finally, when we came back through Heathrow, our two-and-a-half-month-old daughter was detained for six hours by immigration authorities, and we were accused of being child traffickers. Invasive: Local authorities will talk to your parents and your relatives, get bank and work references while they look into whether you can adopt . But Gaia settled in happily and we began to think about adopting again. When we returned to Ealing to tell them that we wanted to adopt another child, we thought our chances were better as a mixed-race family. No chance. The local authority told us we could only adopt another Mexican baby, from Ealing. What were the chances of finding a baby with that exact background in that exact postcode! So we returned to Mexico and adopted Luca. This time, the process took only three months (it took six months for Gaia, because of British inefficiency). To adopt a baby in Britain takes nearly three years. In February, the Government tried to reverse this farcical state of affairs, laying down new guidelines covering ‘transracial’ adoptions, saying that race should not be an issue . But inter-racial adoptions haven’t increased as a result, because local councils and social workers blithely ignore the guidelines and refuse to make the interests of vulnerable little children a priority.

Boris Johnson said he is 'appalled' and is 'on the case' after American singer Kelis said she was subject to alleged racial abuse at a London airport. The London Mayor tweeted the 32-year-old after she launched into an angry Twitter tirade against Britain following the alleged incident at passport control at one . of the capital's airports. He wrote: 'Heard about the treatment you received at a UK airport. Want . you to know this is not typical. I’m appalled & I’m on the case.' On the case: London Mayor Boris Johnson said he is 'appalled' at the treatment American singer Kelis, right, allegedly received at a London airport this week . The Mayor has now written to Rob Whiteman, . chief executive of the UK Border Agency, urging him to remind staff they . are 'the face and voice of modern Britain.' Kelis took to Twitter claiming she was labelled a 'slave' by a . middle-aged white man as she was travelling home to America . with her two-year-old son Knight after performing at Bestival on the . Isle Of Wight over the weekend. Dear Rob . I was alarmed to read press reports about the singer Kelis’s bad . experience at passport control at a London airport. Her main claim was . about a member of the public but she also alleges that uniformed staff . laughed and left her feeling humiliated. Can I take this opportunity to encourage you to remind all UKBA staff . that they are the face and voice of modern Britain - the first people we . encounter when we come home, the first people visitors encounter when . they come to our shores. It is critical for the success of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games . next summer that visitors from all over the globe have a great . experience from beginning to end of their stay and that we showcase the . UK at its best. The Olympics is a one-off opportunity to reinforce . London’s reputation for another generation as the best big city in the . world. It would be wonderful if the people who man our borders are tuned . into this opportunity. Yours ever, . Boris Johnson . The incident took place when Kelis was accused of queue-jumping by a 'red-faced sweaty man (I use the word man loosely here)'. She went on to say he then called her 'slave' and declared she was 'probably a disgusting Nigerian'. The R&B singer explained: 'He called me kunta kinte and ranted and raved some more. 'The man behind the passport desk laughed, shook his head in agreement I guess, and said ""kunta kinte"".

He said: 'Can I take this opportunity to encourage you to remind all UKBA staff . that they are the face and voice of modern Britain - the first people we . encounter when we come home, the first people visitors encounter when . they come to our shores. 'It is critical for the success of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games . next summer that visitors from all over the globe have a great . experience from beginning to end of their stay and that we showcase the .

It would be wonderful if the people who man our borders are tuned . into this opportunity.' Kelis tweeted she was furious about the incident and said dozens of bystanders said nothing. Tricky issue: Kelis took to her Twitter page on Monday after she was allegedly subjected to racist abuse at a London airport . She wrote: 'All the while the entire line full . of people I just sat on a plane with for almost 3hours, over 50 people . said nothing. I mean literally nothing. Didn't flinch.

She continued: 'I didn't say anything . at the time of the riots in London for a lot of reasons. But I am in .

Rude awakening: Kelis was queuing at passport control when the alleged incident took place . After . many fans pointed out America's on-going racial tensions - which were . most recently highlighted during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, . Kelis acknowledged her home country also had issues. She . added: 'I bring it up now because as an American it is abundantly clear . that my country has a Smorgasbord of disgusting racial problems.

"By . Hugo Gye . Last updated at 1:06 PM on 30th September 2011 . A council is spending more than £100,000 of public money on texting congratulations to people who recycle properly. The money will be spent on sending 'positive messages' and 'interesting recycling facts' to Bolton residents who manage to put out their bins on the correct day. But the scheme has been branded as 'patronising' amid suggestions that targeting those who already do the right thing is a waste of money. Rubbish collection: Bolton Council will reward those who put their bins out on time with a congratulatory text or email . Elaine Sherrington, Bolton Council's environment boss, said: 'This has the potential to make a real difference' The news comes the day after the Government announced that it would set aside £250million to fund weekly bin collections. Bolton Council won a pay-out of £110,000 from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to pay for the scheme. Those who sign up to it and . regularly put out their recycling on the right day will receive . congratulatory texts or emails from the council to reward their behaviour. The council insists that making local people 'more involved in the recycling process' will boost recycling levels and make refuse collection work more efficiently. Money from the scheme comes from a special Defra fund of £500,000. More than 70 local authorities applied for funding, but Bolton Council was awarded more than a fifth of the money available. The council says its texts and emails to recyclers will contain 'a positive message related to their participation; a positive message related to levels of participation within their area; a reminder sent the day before recycling collection due; information regarding what can and can’t be recycled; or interesting recycling facts.' But Robert Oxley, campaign manager of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'It's great to see councils working to make recycling simpler, but it needn't cost a small fortune. 'Ensuring information about collection dates is easily available is a positive way to encourage recycling, but it's a little patronising to send congratulatory messages.' However, Bolton Council insists that the scheme will be effective. Councillor Elaine Sherrington, its environment boss, said: 'This has the potential to make a real difference to the borough's recycling rates, and will encourage a lot of people who aren't currently recycling to do so. Rewarding: The council will contact people by phone or email to say well done . The evidence from previous studies shows that this sort of scheme can go a long way to changing behaviour both individually and in a community. 'Also, because the texts will make people who receive them more involved in the recycling process, I hope it will encourage them to act as champions in their area.' A spokesman claimed that this method of encouraging recycling was 'at least as effective as door-stepping' and 'much more cost-effective'. Without a concerted effort to reduce residual waste and drive up recycling rates, disposal costs could increase by £7million to £23million in four years, the council said. A Defra spokesman said: 'Rewarding and recognising people for doing the right thing can encourage a range of positive behaviours, including recycling. 'More than half of us would recycle more if we were given a reward, or were recognised and thanked by the council for our effort.'","Messages will include 'interesting recycling facts'

On the run: Steven Dunne was allowed out for the day, despite a judge ruling he should be detained indefinitely for killing his neighbour . A killer who stabbed his neighbour to death because he thought he was a witch has gone on the run. Paranoid schizophrenic Steven Dunne failed to return to a low secure unit in Hellingly, East Sussex, on Wednesday evening. The 42-year-old stabbed Gordon Stalker, 51, seven times in a frenzied attack on the doorstep of their shared house in Brighton in February last year, believing he was trying to steal his soul. Although a judge ordered him to be locked up indefinitely under Mental Health Act last November, doctors said he posed a low risk to the public and allowed him to take unescorted leave from Southview Low Secure Unit. But police did not warn the public Dunne had failed to return from leave at 5pm on Wednesday until almost 24 hours had passed. In the days leading up to his death Mr Stalker repeatedly told family and friends he was terrified of his neighbour, who had threatened to 'burn him' because he thought he was stealing his soul by taking photos of him on trips out together. The electrician reported Dunne to police twice in June 2009, but he was not thought to be dangerous enough to be locked away. Eight months later he knocked on Mr Stalker's door and stabbed him seven times with a 20cm kitchen knife when he answered. Last year, his victim's father Ian . Stalker, 75, from Carlisle, Cumbria, criticised police and social . services for failing to take the threat Dunne posed seriously. Victim: In the days before his death Gordon Stalker told his family and friends he was 'terrified' of his neighbour Steven Dunne . After Dunne was sentenced, Mr Stalker said: 'It was clear to anyone with eyes to see that this man was a real danger. 'He was seriously disturbed, and needed treatment. My son did everything he could to alert the authorities, but they didn't protect him. 'They were negligent.  As a result I have lost my flesh and blood.' However, police and doctors insist Dunne is no longer a threat to the public. A spokeswoman from the Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said: 'Mr Dunne has been assessed by his clinical team and poses a low risk to himself and to the public, however, it is important he takes regular medication and will need to return to hospital as soon as possible.' Sussex Police said officers have contacted Mr Stalker's family about the incident. Detective Inspector Rob Morland said: 'We are concerned for Steven's welfare and would urge him to get in touch. 'We believe Steven to be in the Brighton area and neighbourhood officers are working with partnership agencies to locate Steven. 'If you see Steven, please contact police immediately.' Dunne is described as white northern European, 5'4, short brown hair, blue eyes, stocky, wearing a red t-shirt, black trousers and blue trainers.",Paranoid schizophrenic Steven Dunne killed neighbour Gordon Stalker last February .
"By . Emma Reynolds . Last updated at 8:16 AM on 30th September 2011 . Ed Miliband has admitted he turned to his spurned brother David for advice on his keynote speech at the Labour conference in Liverpool. The revelation came as a party member blasted the brothers' feud as a 'cloud hanging over Labour.' Mr Miliband said his brother had advised him to 'be his own person' in the speech, and the Labour leader followed it up with an attack last night on the Government's cuts to public sector pensions. Mr Miliband has faced criticism for a lack of strong policies since he beat his brother in last year's leadership contest. Brotherly advice: Ed Miliband (right) denied talk of a feud and said absent brother David advised him on his keynote speech to the conference on Tuesday . He has now criticised David Cameron for wrongly 'slapping a three per cent per cent tax rise on . public sector workers without properly negotiating'. His insistence that the Prime Minister needed to talk to the unions will be well received after Unison's Dave Prentis said this week that millions of workers expected support from Labour. But Mr Miliband was challenged over his troubled relationship with his brother during a question and answer session at the conference and urged to bring David back from 'political Siberia'. Minal Supri, a special constable from Leeds, asked: 'Don't you think it's time to bring David out of political Siberia and for once end all the rumours and innuendo about backbiting? 'Because this party is not going to win if people focus on that and that is what the media is focusing on. Attack: David Cameron came in for criticism from Ed Miliband, who said the Prime Minister had failed to negotiate before cutting public sector pensions . 'We need to unite and we need to move forward otherwise we are not going to win in 2015.' Mr Miliband acknowledged that his defeat of his brother, who is missing the party conference and instead giving a speech in the U.S., had been 'difficult for us'. He said: 'David is a massive asset to our politics and our party... I have always said I would be happy to have him back, I want to have him back, but in the end he has got to decide what is the right thing for him to do. 'He has been incredibly supportive to me in relation to the speech I gave on Tuesday and throughout the last year.' But Ms Supri said later: 'I wanted a straight answer and I didn't get one. We want the party to unite and Ed to put an end to this once and for all. This is a cloud hanging over Labour.' The Labour leader tried to emphasise his closeness to his brother by detailing how David had helped him him develop his vision. He said: 'I talked to him before the speech, he's currently abroad, and he gave me good advice. The advice was ""be your own person, say what you think"" and that's what I did and that's what I'm going to keep doing. 'What I've set out is a vision for how we can change this country and where I stand - against the closed circles of Britain that hold people back. We've seen that today, the top universities not doing enough to open up to state school pupils, that's wrong, I think it's got to change. 'How are we going to take on the vested interests at the top of our society, whether it's the energy companies or the banks, real changes that can help the people of Britain?' In his latest stand against Mr Cameron's pensions changes, Mr Miliband said: 'The most important thing is that we have proper negotiations and the Government engages seriously in the negotiations. Family ties: Ed (left) awkwardly embraces brother David after winning the Laboru leadership contest . 'At the moment what the Government has done is slapped a three per cent tax rise on public sector workers without properly negotiating, without it being recommended by an independent report. 'I say the Government should not be doing that, it should be engaging in proper, serious negotiations with the trade unions. 'It's their responsibility to stop the strike, which is after all scheduled for two months' time if a ballot goes through, it's their responsibility to stop it happening.' Mr Miliband now has the freedom to choose his own frontbench team instead of seeing them elected, after the conference changed the party's rules. But he refused to comment on the possibility of an imminent reshuffle, saying: 'I've got an excellent team. I think it's right to change the rules though, because I don't think the public want us looking inwards having shadow cabinet elections - the old system - but looking outwards to them.' Jasmin Beckett, from Liverpool, was the real star of the show as she told Mr Miliband about cuts at her school, Holly Lodge Girls' College. The 15-year-old won warm applause after describing how her school was being 'attacked by the coalition Government' . The Labour leader was also given a rough ride by disability rights campaigner Kaliya Franklin, 35, from Wirral, who claimed he was 'reinforcing the destructive rhetoric' on welfare by talking about someone he met who was on sickness benefits and could have worked. Mr Miliband replied: 'I'm not questioning the fact that he genuinely had an ailment... but I just say to you the system didn't demand that he go back to work, the system wrote him off.' He added: 'I genuinely don't think that saying you are tough on abuse of the benefit system is a non-Labour thing to do. I think it is fundamentally a Labour thing to do.' He went on to reject calls for a referendum on EU membership, said strikes should only ever be a 'last resort' and said he would like to see more working class MPs. He said that the Arab Spring had taught him that it was 'wrong' to support dictators in the Middle East and North Africa on the grounds that they were a bulwark against terrorism. Mr Miliband later told BBC2's Newsnight he was 'in favour of capitalism, just for the record, but it is what kind of capitalism you have.' He said the New Labour model of using the proceeds of growth to invest in public services and tackle poverty had advantages and disadvantages. 'The disadvantages were that it didn't change the way the economy worked enough, it did not lower inequality, and, also, for the next 10 years, there isn't going to be that money around,' he said. On the final day of the conference, deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman will accuse the Conservatives of plotting to wipe out millions of Labour's core votes by pushing people off the electoral register. The conference will also hear today from some of the 3,000 workers who are set to lose their jobs at BAE Systems.","Party member slams siblings' war as distracting from politics .

"By . Sarah Harris . Last updated at 1:56 AM on 1st October 2011 . Dilemma: Sir Chris Woodhead has got motor neurone disease . Sir Chris Woodhead, the former head of Ofsted, says he would now consider going to the Dignitas clinic to kill himself after watching a controversial BBC documentary. He was diagnosed with motor neurone disease five years ago and now, at 64, he can no longer walk or move his arms. Sir Chris, who took on the Left-wing establishment during his six years in charge of the education watchdog, had previously ruled out travelling to an assisted suicide clinic. Two years ago he said: ‘I would be more likely to drive myself off a cliff in Cornwall than go to Dignitas and speak to a bearded social worker.’ But he admitted in a new interview that the BBC2 programme, Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die, had changed his mind. The documentary, broadcast in June, showed the death of millionaire Peter Smedley at the Swiss clinic. Mr Smedley, 71, also a motor neurone disease (MND) sufferer, gave writer Sir Terry and the TV crew permission to film him drinking poison at Dignitas with his wife Christine, 60, at his side. He was seen choking and gasping for water after he swallowed the barbiturate-based drink. Sir Chris said: ‘It was very dignified. His wife was there and they sat on the sofa together. It was 30 seconds or so, and he was coughing a bit and he looked in some discomfort, but I thought it wasn’t a bad way to go.’ Sir Chris indicated that his views have been shaped by his parents’ deaths. He suspects his father may have had undiagnosed MND, which destroys brain cells and leads to paralysis and possible suffocation. From the BBC film: Peter Smedley shakes hands with Sir Terry Pratchett . Moving: A scene from the BBC2 documentary Choosing To Die. Peter Smedley is comforted by a woman Dignitas as his wife (in navy blue) looks on . Referring to his parents, Sir Chris said: ‘The last five years of their lives, increasingly they felt, “Why can’t we be allowed to die? Why can’t we just hold hands together and go?” They became increasingly irascible as they became increasingly desperate about their plight. ‘Their experience, and my experience watching them, and my  experience now, makes me feel  that there are no persuasive arguments against.’ Sir Chris said his dilemma is that if he waits too long, he may no longer be capable of swallowing the liquid drugs used by the clinic. He said: ‘It’s an issue for me, an incredibly difficult issue, as to what point you decide you’ve had enough and you kill yourself. '[The Government] decided their could be a badger cull... maybe they could agree on a cull of the terminally ill' ‘The decision cannot be entirely your own: Christine, my wife, Tamsin, my daughter, maybe even my granddaughter, the oldest one – they’ve all got views. ‘If it weren’t for them I might already have said I’d had enough.’ Sir Chris, who once claimed there were 15,000 incompetent teachers in the education system, believes it is an outrage that terminally ill patients have to travel abroad to end their lives in a way of their choosing. He added: ‘The thing that worries me about assisted dying is I don’t think our politicians are ever going to have the b***s. ‘Maybe I’m wrong. They’ve decided that there could be a badger cull; maybe they could agree, too, that there should be a cull of the terminally ill!’ Almost 900 viewers made formal complaints to the BBC about the programme by Sir Terry, who has Alzheimer’s, while others took to internet sites to accuse the corporation of ‘romanticising’ and ‘normalising’ assisted death. Controversial: More than 150 Britons have ended their lives at the Dignitas clinic in Zurich (pictured) over the past eight years . The charity, Care Not Killing, warned that the documentary  posed a ‘significant risk’ to vulnerable people and said copycat suicides were ‘highly likely’. More than 150 Britons have ended their lives at the Dignitas clinic in Zurich over the past eight years, taking advantage of Swiss laws that allow assisted suicide. This has opened up cracks in British law, under which helping someone to commit suicide is a crime carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years in jail. It is usually impossible for someone who is seriously ill to travel to die without help from family or friends. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, drew up guidelines suggesting that those who help a death will not be prosecuted it they act out of compassion and do not stand to gain from it. No one has been prosecuted over a Dignitas death, even though Mr Starmer has been given nearly 40 cases to consider since his guidelines were published.","Former head of Ofsted has motor neurone disease .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 2:11 PM on 1st October 2011 . With 50,000 fans on their feet and many with tears in their eyes, six-year-old Cooper Stone stood and tossed a ceremonial first pitch of the baseball playoffs to his favourite player, Josh Hamilton. Cooper is the boy who saw his fireman father Shannon  fall to his death while trying to catch a ball thrown to him by Hamilton during a Texas Rangers game in Arlington in early July. This was his first trip back to Rangers Ballpark - and it came at the centre of a huge stage, with his widowed mother, Jenny Stone, and Rangers president Nolan Ryan by his side. Emotional: Jenny Stone, centre, gets a hug from Texas Rangers left fielder Josh Hamilton, next to Rangers owner and president Nolan Ryan, left, as Mrs Stone's son, Cooper stands at right before the start of their game . Wearing a Rangers jersey featuring Hamilton's No. 32 and ‘Cooper’ between the shoulders, the boy threw the ball on a line to Hamilton - crouched like a catcher about halfway to the home plate. Tragedy: Veteran fireman Shannon Stone died after he fell from the stand in front of his young son . The outfielder - who has been through his share of personal struggles - stood to catch it, then pumped his fist, smiling wide the whole time. Then he went to the front of the pitcher’s mound to meet Cooper and Mrs Stone for the first time. Hamilton embraced the boy, then his mother. He held her for a while, speaking words that made it tough for her to control her emotions. ‘I just asked her if they were believers in Christ and she said they were,’ Hamilton said. ‘I said: “Well, we know where your husband is right now. Make sure that the little one knows who his daddy was and what he stood for”.’ Mrs Stone appeared to thank Hamilton. They hugged again, then Hamilton - whose wife gave birth to their third daughter only a few weeks ago - gave Cooper another hug too. The reigning American League Most Valuable Player (AL MVP) started heading to the dugout, only to realize he still had the ball. So he reached back and gave it to Cooper. A security guard met Cooper as he reached the dirt in front of the Texas dugout and gave him a fist bump. Nelson Cruz was the first of many Rangers waiting at the steps of the dugout to slap hands with the boy. His mother wiped tears as she walked away with Mr Ryan. ‘They have turned a difficult return to The Ballpark into a once-in-a-lifetime experience for Cooper,’ Mrs Stone said in a statement issued by the team. Big moment: Jenny Stone, left, walks on the field with Texas Rangers owner and president, baseball legend Nolan Ryan, before the start of Game 1 of their MLB American League Division Series baseball playoffs . ‘Nothing could be more exciting for a boy than throwing out the first pitch to his favourite player. We are glad and grateful to be here to see the Rangers start their march to the World Series.’ Cooper, his mum and six more in their group sat in front-row seats one section closer to home plate than Mr Ryan. When Hamilton singled in his first at-bat, Cooper jumped up and down, twirling a red towel. ‘We're just honoured that they were willing to come out and do that and share the day with us,’ Mr Ryan said. Shannon Stone was reaching for the ball thrown by Hamilton when he fell headfirst about 20ft, landing on concrete behind the outfield wall. Cooper was his only child, and the two . were extremely close, with the nearly three-hour drive from their home . in Brownwood to Rangers games among their favourite activities together. The . Rangers recently announced plans to build a statue of Shannon and . Cooper Stone outside the home-plate entrance as a tribute to them, and . to all fans. Memorial walk: Family members follow the procession with the fire truck carrying the coffin of Stone after his funeral in Brownwood, Texas . Remembered: Brownwood Fire Department Lt. G. Nesom carries the helmet of Mr Stone as he leads pallbearers out of First United Methodist Church following a service for him in Texas . The team hopes to unveil it by the opening day next season. The club also is planning to raise the railing throughout the stadium. 'They have turned a difficult return to The Ballpark into a once-in-a-lifetime experience for Cooper. Nothing could be more exciting for a boy than throwing out the first pitch to his favourite player. We are glad and grateful to be here to see the Rangers start their march to the World Series' Jenny Stone . A memorial fund started by the team on the family's behalf recently received more than $150,000 from an auction sponsored by Fox Sports Southwest, the team's main broadcaster. ‘I call (Jenny) periodically just to . see how she's doing and see if they have any needs that we might be able . to assist with,’ Mr Ryan said. ‘It's been on-going since the accident.’ Mr Ryan also discussed with Mrs Stone the best time for Cooper to return to the stadium. The boy wanted to come sooner, but Mrs Stone ‘wasn't ready to deal with it,’ Mr Ryan said. However, she realised that coming back ‘was in (Cooper's) best interests, because this is what he was wanting to do.’ Floral tribute: Wreaths and flowers were placed outside the Central Fire Station in Brownwood in memory of Shannon Stone of the Brownwood Fire Department . Help: Fellow fan Ronnie Hargis, who had been chatting to the victim moments before the tragedy, leans out to try and grab him but it is too late . A few weeks ago, Mr Ryan called to invite them for the final home-stand. Knowing the play-offs were likely, he also invited them to not only come to the game, but to throw out the first pitch. The Rangers played the Tampa Bay Rays in . Game 1 of their American League division series, which also happened to . be the first game of the entire postseason. 'We're just honoured that they were willing to come out and do that and share the day with us' Texas Rangers president Nolan Ryan . ‘He represents what we believe we're about and he is a very dyed-in-the-wool Ranger fan,’ Mr Ryan said. Mr . Ryan also made sure Hamilton felt comfortable being part of this. Hamilton is a recovering substance abuser whose career nearly was . derailed by his personal demons. ‘I . went to Josh before we decided anything and asked Josh how he felt . about it, because I didn't want to put Josh in any awkward position,’ Mr . Ryan said. Hamilton said he prayed to help steel himself for the moment, and to know what to say. Convoy: A funeral processional for Stone makes its way along FM 45 on the way to the cemetery .

It worked out good. ... You could tell she was really emotional about coming back to the park. ‘The little one, he's young enough where he understands but at the same time it's not as emotional for him as it is mom.’ Cooper and his family sat near the Rangers' on-deck circle, and Hamilton gladly caught the boy's eye several times. It was a nice counter to the scoreboard in a game the Rangers lost 9-0 to the Rays. ‘Just to see the smile on his face and him enjoying himself,’ Hamilton said, ‘it was pretty special to see.'","Cooper Stone throws first pitch before Texas Rangers v Tampa Bay Rays .

"By . Stephen Wright . Last updated at 10:11 AM on 1st October 2011 . Allegations: Ali Dizaei, pictured today, was reinstated to his job at the Met Police but was then immediately suspended . A controversial police chief awaiting trial for alleged corruption could receive up to £180,000 in back pay after being dramatically reinstated at Scotland Yard. Ali Dizaei, 49, was sacked from his £110,000 a year commander’s job in the Metropolitan Police after he was jailed last year for misconduct and perverting the course of justice. But his convictions were overturned  in May and on the orders of three Appeal Court judges, he will now face a re-trial  in January. Since winning the new trial, Mr Dizaei has insisted he should be treated as an innocent person and given his job back at the Met. The Police Appeals Tribunal ruled on Wednesday that he should be reinstated. But last night the Iranian-born policeman was suspended on full pay by the Metropolitan Police Authority. According to insiders, Mr Dizaei is likely to be entitled to back pay for his 18 months off the Scotland Yard payroll. This could be worth up to £180,000 with allowances. Mr Dizaei said today he would appeal against his suspension. 'Yes I am, I think out of principle,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'I think your ordinary citizen will say a person is being paid a pay package he should earn and work for that money. 'There are plenty of jobs I could be doing to earn the money I am being paid without interfering with frontline policing.' He accused long-standing members of the MPA of being suspicious of non-white officers in senior positions at the Met. 'I think you need to distinguish the difference between the Met and the police authority,' he said. 'I think there is an attitude within the police authority and particularly among some of the individuals who have been there for a very long time, the last 10 years, who simply say we do have a suspicion around senior ethnic minority officers.' Dizaei is due to stand trial again early next year accused of misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of justice. He launched a bid to get his job back after he was let out of Leyhill open prison when Lord Justice Hughes and two other judges said the Court of Appeal had been 'driven to the conclusion' that his conviction 'cannot be regarded as safe'. Under the terms of his suspension, he is entitled to draw a full salary while he awaits the re-trial. In addition, the former president of the National Black Police Association is expected to receive substantial damages from the owners of the now-defunct News of the World, which allegedly hacked his mobile phone voicemails. Ali Dizaei walks hand-in-hand with his wife Shy in Bristol during day release from an open prison in April . His case is a major test of the . leadership of new Met chief Bernard Hogan-Howe, who has preached the . importance of integrity, honesty and fairness during his first full week . in charge of Britain’s biggest force. News . of Mr Dizaei’s reinstatement was first revealed yesterday by BBC Radio . 4’s Today programme, which has a long history of running positive . stories about him. It was . the same programme which disclosed before Christmas that Mr Dizaei’s . lawyers had uncovered grounds for his original convictions to be . quashed. Yesterday Mr . Dizaei said: ‘I am delighted to be reinstated. I have always wanted to . be a Met Police officer and now vow to clear my name.’ Later, . announcing his suspension, the police authority said: ‘Suspension is . not a disciplinary sanction and it is emphasised that suspension should . not be taken as a presumption of guilt.’ Mr . Dizaei is due to stand trial at Southwark Crown Court in South London . accused of misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of . justice. He was at court for a pre-trial hearing yesterday. The . charges are linked to an incident outside the Persian Yas restaurant in . Kensington, West London, on July 18, 2008. Mr Dizaei is accused of . arresting a man after a row despite knowing he did not have reasonable . grounds to do so. He is also . alleged to have perverted the course of justice by falsely claiming in . written statements that he was a victim of an unprovoked assault by the . man. Mr Dizaei, who denies the charges, was released from prison in May after 15 months behind bars. He has retained the services of PSB Law, a Central London firm which specialises in ‘reputation and brand protection’. Yesterday the firm issued a statement which hinted that race issues could feature in future proceedings. It said: ‘Commander Dizaei has always maintained that his previous dismissal from the Metropolitan Police Force [in March 2010] pending his criminal appeal was in haste and unfair. That appeal was heard in May of this year and resulted in the quashing of Commander Dizaei’s convictions. ‘Commander Dizaei has on-going proceedings in the employment tribunal against the Metropolitan Police Authority and a number of senior individuals in that organisation relating to the way in which Commander Dizaei has been treated over a substantial period.’ According to the BBC, his lawyers have also said he will consider challenging his suspension in the courts, claiming many senior white police staff have been allowed to stay in their posts while criminal investigations take place. The allegations against Dizaei stem from an incident that took place at the Yas restaurant, pictured, in Kensington, London . Former commander Ali Dizaei claims a police appeal tribunal has 'unanimously' dismissed his sacking . A thorn in the side of at least three commissioners, he has been outspoken critic of senior ranks. Last year the 49-year-old became the most senior policeman to be jailed for corruption in 33 years after he was convicted of misconduct. Mr Dizaei, whose father was deputy commissioner of Tehran’s police force, came to Britain in 1973 and was privately educated before training as a barrister and joining Thames Valley police in 1986. He rose swiftly through the ranks and was poached by the Met in 1999, the year in which the Macpherson report accused the force of being 'institutionally racist'. Senior officers were keen to promote talented young ethnic minority officers. As such, he quickly became outspoken on race issues as well as gaining quick promotion and being elected as president of the Black Police Association. He was also the most senior Muslim officer in the UK. In 2009 he was charged with misconduct after an inquiry by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and then convicted at Southwark crown court in February last year. Supporters claimed that he had again been victimised because of his race. Mr Dizaei, who has three sons, is married to third wife Shy.","Dizaei, 49, due to stand trial accused of misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of justice ."
"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 1:00 PM on 30th September 2011 . Ridiculous: Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been told to stop his conspiracy theories about 9/11 . Outspoken controversial Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been told by Al-Qaeda to stop his conspiracy theories claiming that the U.S. was to blame for the 9/11 attacks. The terrorist organisation has reportedly sent a message to the Iranian president asking him to stop spreading his 'ridiculous belief' about the 2001 attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people. According to the Guardian, Iranian media reported on Wednesday quotes from Al-Qaeda's English language magazine, criticising Ahmadinejad's latest comments. The Iranian leader caused a U.S. delegation to walk out of his UN general assembly speech last week when . he cast doubt over the official version of the 2001 attacks by referring . to 9/11 as a 'mystery'. Delegates . from several other countries, including Israel, Ireland and Fiji, also . walked out while Ahmadinejad was still talking. According . to Iranian media, the article in Inspire said: 'The Iranian government . has professed on the tongue of its president Ahmadinejad that it does . not believe that Al-Qaeda was behind 9/11 but rather, the US government. 'So . we may ask the question: why would Iran ascribe to such a ridiculous . belief that stands in the face of all logic and evidence?' The Guardian reported that the Al-Qaeda article insisted it was behind the terror attacks, before criticising Ahmadinejad for discrediting the terrorist group. The Iranian president's controversial speech prompted a walkout by many in the UN last week . The Inspire article continued: 'For them, Al-Qaeda was a competitor for the hearts and minds of the disenfranchised Muslims around the world. Al-Qaeda... succeeded in what Iran couldn't. 'Therefore it was necessary for the Iranians to discredit 9/11 and what better way to do so? Conspiracy theories.' Publication: Inspire, the Al-Qaeda English language magazine, said the Iranian president's comments were 'ridiculous' Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had outraged the UN last week by calling the 9/11 attack on the U.S. 'a mystery' shortly after the 10th anniversary of the atrocity. In a speech full of questions which were no more than thinly veiled attacks on the U.S. he asked the UN who had used the 'mysterious September 11 incident' as a precursor to war and to dominate the Middle East? He added: 'By using their imperialistic media network which is under the influence of colonialism they threaten anyone who questions the Holocaust and the September 11 event with sanctions and military actions,' he said. When the idea of an independent fact-finding investigation of 'the hidden elements' involved in the attacks was raised last year, he said, 'my country and myself came under pressure and threat by the government of the United States.' 'Instead of assigning a fact-finding team, they killed the main perpetrator and threw his body into the sea,' Ahmadinejad said, referring to the U.S. military's killing of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in early May. Terror attack: The World Trade Centre towers shortly after they were hit . 'Would it not have been reasonable to bring to justice and openly to trial the main perpetrator of the incident in order to identify the elements behind the safe space provided for the invading aircraft to attack the twin world trade towers?,' he asked. No stranger to outrageous comments, Ahmadinejad began his speech by highlighting the plight of the world's poorest nations, but included the U.S. in that by saying the country suffered from 'inequality'. Ahmadinejad then cryptically said this year he planned 'to analyse the current [global] situation from a different angle'. He then went on to single out a regular target of his, blaming Zionism for the wars in the Korean peninsula and Vietnam.","Iranian president called it 'the September 11 mystery'

"By . Tamara Cohen . Last updated at 2:44 PM on 28th September 2011 . A painkiller taken by millions can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke by 40 per cent, a study has found. Researchers say that while there is no need for patients to panic, diclofenac should be restricted to prescription only. In completely healthy patients, a 40 per cent raised chance of heart problems is not at all significant. But for those who already have a high risk of a heart attack or stroke, taking the painkiller could present serious problems. Researchers say that while there is no need for patients to panic, diclofenac should be restricted to prescription only. The drug is given to 6million patients . Last night the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said that patients should not stop taking the drug, but should consult their doctor if they have fears over its safety. Last year almost 17million prescriptions were written by GPs in England for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, for conditions such as arthritis, back pain, gout, headaches and fever. Of these, diclofenac was the most commonly prescribed and given to 6million patients. It can also be bought over-the-counter under the brand name Voltarol Pain-Eze for around £6. It is at lower strength but still carries a 22 per cent higher risk. Dr Patricia McGettigan of Hull York Medical School, who led the landmark review of studies looking at nearly 3million people, said: ‘Diclofenac on prescription was associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk of 40 per cent. ‘People take it because it’s . effective, but it’s very important for patients and doctors to know the . risks associated with these drugs for high-risk patients. The painkiller can also be bought over the counter under the brand name Voltarol Pain-Eze for around £6. It is at lower strength but still carries a 22 per cent higher risk . ‘It is now available over the counter, and our study suggests there is a case for looking at that again and making it prescription-only as well as strengthening advice to doctors and patients about how it should be used. ‘There is a very clear increase in risk as the dose goes up, which says to people who perhaps can’t get out of bed due to arthritis and take diclofenac, take a different drug instead and you might be at a lower risk of heart attack and stroke. ‘We have reviewed all the previous studies and are confident that the results are robust enough to inform clinical and regulatory decisions.’ This is the first study to measure the relative risks of different drugs, and it found that ibuprofen and naproxen had the lowest risk of cardiovascular problems. Many patients were transferred to . diclofenac from Vioxx, the painkiller which was withdrawn by . manufacturer Merck in 2004 after it was linked to heart attacks and . strokes. Many patients were transferred to diclofenac from Vioxx, the painkiller which was withdrawn by manufacturer Merck in 2004 after it was linked to heart attacks and strokes . Patients will . often be at minimal risk. For a young woman, the risk of having a heart . attack will be around 0.1 per cent and a 40 per cent rise is still just . 0.14 per cent. However for a pensioner who has already had one heart attack, a 40 per cent increase could be significant. Doreen Maddock of the British Heart . Foundation said: ‘The potential risks for heart patients taking certain . painkillers have been known for some time and these findings shouldn’t . be ignored. But scientists and drug regulators will need to delve deeper . before we draw any firm conclusions. ‘As with any medicine there are benefits . and potential risks to taking painkillers. If you’re already taking . these types of drugs and are worried, don’t simply give up on your . medication. You should always speak to your doctor first because the . benefits may well outweigh the risks for you.’ A spokesman for the MHRA said: ‘Our . priority is to ensure that the benefits of medication outweigh the . risks. NSAID treatment is associated with a small increased risk of . heart attacks and stroke. The risk is higher with long-term treatment. ‘Clear warnings about the risk of gastro-intestinal and heart problems, along with information about those patient groups in which NSAIDs either should not be used, such as those with severe heart failure, or only used with caution, are contained in the product information including the patient information leaflet that accompanies the medicine. ‘To minimise the risk of side effects, all NSAIDs should be used at the lowest possible dose for the shortest period necessary to control symptoms. ‘People should not stop taking their NSAID medicine, but if they have any questions or concerns about their treatment they should speak to their doctor. ‘The MHRA keeps the safety of NSAIDs under close review and any new data will be carefully evaluated.’ A spokesman for Novartis, which makes Voltarol, said: ‘In our view, this analysis, in the context of the vast clinical experience worldwide, does not change the favourable benefit-to-risk assessment for diclofenac when used as directed. ‘Novartis is confident about the safety profile of diclofenac products.’","Diclofenac can raise risk by 40 per cent .

But Michelle Obama's casual slip-out trip to Target is being met with scepticism, as media personalities deride the ‘incognito’ visit as a well-timed PR stunt. Only last month the First Lady was accused of indulging in luxury holidays worth $10million dollars on the tax payers’ dime. First lady Michelle Obama, wearing a hat and sunglasses, center, stands in line at a Target Department store . And barely a week ago, the 47-year-old mother-of-two was criticised for wearing $40,000 diamonds to a fund-raising event. But with Obama’s domestic popularity at one . of its lowest ebbs, she seems determined to her fight her husband's . re-election battle by her self-proclaimed campaign wife motto of ‘Do no . harm'. Showing the world that she really can do recession chic, Mrs Obama headed to a Target store in Alexandria, Virginia, on Thursday afternoon. Secret Service officers reportedly swept the store on Highway 1, 30 minutes before Mrs Obama popped in for her housewives' essentials- dog food and cleaning products. Wearing a Nike baseball cap, sunglasses and a floral-print button-down shirt, the glamorous mother walked in . through the main entrance with just one assistant, an unknown female aide. The fashionable lawyer spent about 30 minutes . minutes shopping, pushing her own trolley. She was recognised only by the . cashier who rang up her purchases, Today reported. Maria Panagopulos, a store manager at . the Target in Alexandria, told NBC News claimed the store was given no . advance notice about the first lady’s visit. Mrs Obama checked . out at around 3.30 pm she said, and daughters, Sasha and Malia, were . not with her.

The cashier recognised . her, but she was very unassuming.' 'We did not have advance notice; it was as big a . surprise to us as it was to everyone else.' The White House confirmed that it was indeed the First Lady. 'It is not uncommon for the First Lady to slip out to run an errand, eat . at a local restaurant or otherwise enjoy the city outside the White . House gates,' a spokesman told CBS News. One of the mother-of-two's more memorable 'slip outs' was to DC's BLT Steak . restaurant in April, when hockey superstar Alex Ovechkin tweeted a photo . of himself with his arm around the First Lady. Target also tweeted Mrs. Obama's visit to their store. 'First Lady Michelle Obama may be incognito but there is no denying . those signature @Target red carts!' was tweeted from the @Bullseyeview . account. @Target retweeted it.

Mrs Obama seemed at pains to appear . extra down to earth by pushing her own cart and carrying her own . shopping bags, examiner.com reported. Associated Press photographer Charles Dharapak caught a few images of Mrs Obama reaching the check out. But conservative blogger Michelle Malkin mocked the idea that it was a chance meeting as, 'snortalicious'. Malkin blogged: 'She left the bling at home. But her shirt and sunglasses are . about as ""incognito” as Lady Gaga’s outfit at her younger sister’s . graduation.' Radio host Rush Limbaugh also denounced the visit on his show as a 'photo-op'.He said: 'It has gotten so bad they had to send Moochelle out there in a Lady Gaga-type getup,' 'What a phony baloney plastic banana good time rock-and-roller optic photo op this was!' 'You think the AP has photographers waiting outside stores for Moochelle to show up?"" Limbaugh asked. ""Who do they think we are?' On his Twitter profile photographer Dharapak names the White House as one of his beats. And only on Monday the photographer had taken pictures of Mrs Obama inside the . White House as she made an announcement about womens' STEM career . issues. Certainly the White House have not so far denied that Dharapak was tipped off. After shopping for around 40 minutes she reportedly left the store with towels and cleaning supplies, according to Today. Alongside the humble groceries were dog food and treats for First Dog Bo, People magazine reported. Of course, the possibility that Mrs . Obama was in fact trying the get the last of the Missoni . Target collaboration cannot be ruled out. But she reportedly left without a bargain from the Italian designer, Business Insider reported. Michelle has a long standing relationship with Target, declaring in 2008 that she as more target than Walmart. A year later she was spotted wearing a Target dress, as she left Air Force Once with daughter Sasha. And only in May she told Oprah Winfrey that she missed casual shopping trips from her life before the White House. 'I can't go to Target and walk around. I guess I could but it would mess up everyone else's shopping experience.' Canine cuddles: While at the shops Mrs Obama picked out some treats and food for Bo the much-loved White House dog .

As part of her campaign to beat childhood obesity the First Lady has formed . a partnership for the Let's Move! campaign with Walmart, who, unlike Target, have promised to cut down on salt, sugar and fat in their food, the Foodorama blog . reported . Mrs Obama is currently involved in a major fund-raising effort in the run-up to her husband's re-election campaign. But she will have to work hard to counter her spendthrift reputation. In August White House sources claimed that the First Lady has spent $10million of U.S. taxpayers' money on vacations in the past year. Calling the 47-year-old mother-of-two a ’vacation junkie’ they described her  penchant for five-star hotels, where she splashes out expensive treats such as  massages. The 'top source' told the National Enquirer: 'It's disgusting. Michelle is taking advantage of her privileged position while the most hard-working Americans can barely afford a week or two off work. 'When it's all added up, she's spent more than $10million in taxpayers' money on her vacations.' The source continued: 'The vacations are totally Michelle's idea. She's like a junkie.

In a victory for householders and the Daily Mail, ministers unveiled a £250million fund to restore them. Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said councils will now have ‘no excuse’ to maintain hugely unpopular fortnightly schemes. ‘My view has always been that people expect a weekly collection,’ he said. Town halls are to be shamed into bringing back weekly bin collections following uproar over fortnightly collections . STEVE DOUGHTY: Don't you wish you had a truth drug you could introduce into the water coolers at your nearest palace of local government? If . you could, these are the 10 straight answers you might get if you put . questions to the council on the subject of the day, the bins.

It’s time to understand there’s a limit to what Middle England will take.’ He cannot force town halls to go back to weekly collections, but made it clear that voters should throw out councils which do not – a provocative suggestion, given that many of those that have gone fortnightly are Conservative controlled. Mr Pickles told the Daily Mail: ‘I’ve had council leaders sitting at this very table who claim their public like a fortnightly collection and are very supportive. Well, good luck to them. Come the elections, there can be no excuses.’ The announcement is a major victory for the Mail's 'great bin revolt campaign', which has highlighted the problems associated with fortnightly collections . The announcement is a major victory for . the Mail’s ‘great bin revolt campaign’, which has highlighted the . problems associated with the shift to fortnightly collections. Local authorities will have to guarantee weekly bin rounds for the next five years to qualify for the funding. Once-a-week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 and were maintained until after Labour’s 1997 election victory, when local authorities were encouraged to collect household waste and recyclable rubbish on alternate weeks. Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said councils will now have 'no excuse' to maintain hugely unpopular fortnightly schemes . Householders quickly began to complain about increases in rats and other pests, unpleasant smells from food waste left uncollected for up to a fortnight, and a plethora of bin fines and taxes imposed on those who broke the rules. Now at least half the homes in Britain have lost their weekly collections of general rubbish. Mr Pickles said it was quite possible to increase recycling rates while also offering weekly collections of all rubbish. He hailed the example of Windsor and Maidenhead, which has increased recycling by 35 per cent by offering households incentives such as shopping vouchers or loyalty card points. Mr Pickles said councils could use . the new cash to introduce innovative technology such as facilities which . sort rubbish into recyclable items and those that need to go to . landfill. ‘My aim has always been to pass the chicken tikka masala test, . so the nation’s favourite meal can be consumed on Friday night safe . from the worry that two weeks later its remains will still be rotting in . the bottom of the bin,’ he said. ‘I also want an end to bin blight, where rows of bins run the risk of obscuring a small bungalow. ‘Labour’s solution was to bully councils into fortnightly collections. My view is this goes beyond bins – it’s about a question of trust between politicians and the public. ‘The truth is that it’s possible to protect and enhance the environment and encourage people to do the right thing, while also adopting a sensible approach to dealing with waste.’ Daily Mail, June 2009 . Daily Mail, September 2009 . Daily Mail, April 2011 . The Local Government  Secretary’s announcement follows a battle between him and Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman, who tried to ditch a Tory election pledge to restore traditional weekly collections. Mr Pickles insisted that Mrs Spelman – with whom he is said to have fallen out so badly that they stopped speaking for a period – was fully on side. ‘Defra should be very pleased. Both Caroline and I campaigned for this in opposition and we are now delivering that in government,’ he said. Mr Pickles said the cash for the scheme was coming from within his department, even after spending cuts have been made. Doretta Cocks, founder of the Campaign for Weekly Waste, said: ‘I am extremely pleased that this funding has been made available and our members will be absolutely delighted.’ Matthew Elliott of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘Rubbish collection may not be seen as a sexy issue to the chattering classes in London, but it is of great concern to ordinary hardworking taxpayers. ‘Woe betide the councils who do not reinstate weekly bin collections or who persist with plans to scrap this basic service, causing misery to residents.’","Local authorities will have to guarantee weekly bin rounds for five years to qualify for funding .

Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson and James May have driven into trouble yet again - this time for parking in disabled bays during filming of the hit show. In a feature on Sunday night's episode, the pair tried out electric cars by driving them to Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, where they pulled into a car park to discuss the merits of the motors. But rather than parking in normal parking bays, they parked in spaces reserved for disabled people - causing a storm of protest from disabled motoring groups who said it was 'typical' of Clarkson. Scandal: Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson and James May have driven into trouble yet again for parking in disabled bays during filming of the hit show . To add fuel to the fire, just after the slot about electric cars, Richard Hammond met a team of disabled soldiers who had been severely injured in Afghanistan. The soldiers - some who had lost three limbs - were shown laughing and joking with Hammond as they took part in a cross-country racing in 4x4 cars as they prepare for the grueling Dakar Rally. During the slot about electric cars, Jeremy Clarkson - driving a £31,000 Nissan Leaf - and James May - driving a £33,000 Peugeot iOn - discussed the merits of non-petrol cars, asking 'should you buy an electric car?' After parking up in the disabled bays the pair laughed and joked about the costs of the cars and the electric motors - which are capable of a top speed of up to 90mph. Typical: Rather than parking in normal parking bays, Jeremy Clarkson and James May parked in spaces reserved for disabled people, sparking outrage among disability groups . They also joked about the luggage space and how electric cars had to be fitted with special windscreen wipers which make barely any noise. But it was as they stepped out of their cars - with Clarkson and May even standing on top of a disabled road marking - that shocked viewers realised they had parked in disabled bays. Is it ok for Top Gear stars to park in a disabled bay 'for a laugh'? Jim Rawlings, of Disabled Motoring UK, said he was sure that Clarkson 'wouldn't have cared' about parking up in a disabled bay. He said: 'I'm sure the last thing on Jeremy Clarkson's mind was that he was parked in a disabled bay. 'The abuse of non-disabled people . parking in disabled bays is rife, and with people like Jeremy Clarkson . and James May doing this other motorists will just think they can just . park wherever they like.

Naughty: Top Gear's Jeremy Clarkson (left) and James May (right) are in trouble for parking in a disabled parking bay for a segment of the show . 'I'm sure Jeremy Clarkson especially would not feel contrite about parking in a disabled bay - it shows a lack of feeling and care and a total lack of compassion.' Peter Lyne, of the Disabled Motorists Foundation, said it was 'extremely frustrating' watching non-disabled people park in disabled parking bays. He said: 'It's an immense problem and . is an extremely frustrating issue which is not helped by the likes of . Jeremy Clarkson and James May.' And . viewer Adam Sullivan, 32, added: 'I was disgusted to see them parking . up in a disabled bays. The pair of them were even standing about on the . disability road markings and they didn't even notice it. 'For . them to be so casual about it is disgusting and they should be hauled . over the coals - along with the entire production team - for doing . something which in the end, will encourage viewers to think there is . nothing wrong with parking in disabled bays.' The BBC has leapt to the defence of its popular presenters. Controversial: It is just eight months since the team sparked a diplomatic incident by poking fun at Mexicans . A spokesman said the show's team did not 'condone parking in disabled bays' and admitted it had cordoned off spaces reserved for disabled motorists, after striking an agreement with the owner of the land, for the segment. Andy Wilman is the Executive Producer of Top Gear said: 'Firstly, we did have permission from the owner of the premises to park in the disabled bays, which gave us a quiet spot to film in, and there were three other disabled bays available which remained empty throughout. Secondly, for those who are cross with us, please direct your anger towards myself and the production team, rather than at Jeremy and James. Jeremy Clarkson hit out at electric cars during the programme saying they ""are not the future."" His comments have riled electric car . maker Nissan which has invested heavily in the electric motors and plans . to create 800 jobs by building its Leaf car in Sunderland. Clarkson made the comments on . Sunday's episode of Top Gear where he road tested the £31,000 Leaf - and . was filmed being pushed around in the car that had a flat battery. Push! James May pushes Jeremy Clarkson in the Nissan Leaf after it runs out of power . Producers then showed him stranded in . Lincoln where he spent the next few hours brass-rubbing whilst he . waited for the battery to re-charge. However, Nissan claims that viewers . were not told that the battery had been more than half empty at the . start of the trip - and only had enough power to go 35 miles. Information from a Nissan monitoring device which was in the Leaf showed that when Clarkson set off on his 60 mile trip to Cleethorpes in Lincolnshire the battery was only 40 per cent charged. The firm says the car was delivered to Top Gear with a full battery and enough power to drive 100 miles. It said the device also showed that . Clarkson did not switch on the 'eco-mode' in the car which would have . makes the car go further by slowing acceleration. Nissan's executive vice president Andy Palmer told The Times the programme was ""misleading."" The BBC said it ""absolutely refuted"" it had misled viewers over the charge and range. Top Gear says electric cars, like the Nissan Leaf Clarkson drove, are still too expensive and the charging infrastructure is still poor . Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman said: 'We never at any point in the film said that were testing the range . claims of the vehicles, nor did we say that the vehicles wouldn't . achieve their claimed range. 'We also never said at any time that we were . hoping to get to our destination on one charge. 'We never said what the length of the journey was, where we had started . from, or how long we had been driving for at the start of the film, so . again, no inference about the range can be gleaned from our film.' Mr Wilman said the consumer points from the programme were clear, that electric cars are still very expensive, re-charging infrastructure is patchy, the range varies enormously. He said the Leaf was ""a very good car per se"" but said the battery, in Top Gear's view ""remains the Achilles heel of the whole package."" A Nissan spokesman said: 'The Nissan LEAF battery pack is designed to last the lifetime of the car. If used in normal conditions, it is not expected that owners will ever have to replace the battery pack. 'Some degradation of the battery over time and use is normal, but the battery pack has been designed so that it offers a respectable range even after this degradation has taken place.' Both presenters expressed deep . concern to the film crew and I about using the disabled bays prior to . filming, because of the disrespectful impression it would convey. They only capitulated when we assured . them the parking had been approved by the owner, and that the disabled . bay markings would not appear on television. This was our fault, not theirs, and we unreservedly apologise to all the viewers we have upset as a consequence.' The furore comes eight months after the pair, alongside Richard Hammond, were slammed for poking fun at Mexicans. Hammond said Mexican cars reflected national characteristics, saying they were ‘just going to be lazy, feckless, flatulent’. James described Mexican food as ‘like . sick with cheese on it’, while Jeremy predicted they would not get any . complaints about the show because ‘at the Mexican embassy, the . ambassador is going to be sitting there with a remote control like this . (snores)’.","They have also upset Nissan saying electric cars like theirs ""are not the future"""

The woman, from the south of the country, had a huge proportion of her face bitten off in the mauling by her own dog, spanning from her upper lip all the way to her eye . Swedish surgeons have used hundreds of leeches to help reconstruct a woman’s face that was bitten off during a horrific dog attack. The woman, from the south of the country, had a huge proportion of her face bitten off in the mauling by her own dog, spanning from her upper lip all the way to her eye. As she was rushed to hospital last month, her relatives who were with her at the time, managed to recover the loose skin and keep it chilled. They quickly arrived at Skane University Hospital in Malmo with the flesh, which was able to be re-attached with the help of 358 leeches. Specialist surgeon Jens Larsson told Sweden’s English newspaper The Local: ‘She arrived to the emergency room in Malmo in the middle of the night from another Skane hospital.’ Larsson then called another specialist, Stina Klasson, to come in and help her with the operation. ‘The most important thing was to get blood into the torn-off body part, which we managed to do within an hour of the start of the operation’, Klasson said. The complicated surgery lasted for 15 hours, during which Klasson and Larsson had to repair the unnamed woman’s upper lip, nose and parts of her cheek. During the procedure, the specialists used the leeches to force blood to flow into the damaged skin. The leeches helped re-start circulation through their sucking and blood-thinning fluids. Klasson said: ‘The grower who supplies the hospital with leeches ran out, so more had to be flown in from the UK.’ The doctors said the operation was successful, but the woman will continue to need re-constructive surgery in the future. Larsson said: ‘The results appear to be good. Her whole nose has survived. The patient can breathe, eat and talk.’ Although similar procedures using leeches have been performed around the world, this operation is thought to be the first of its kind in the Nordic region. The patient’s dog was put down after the attack.","The worms forced blood to flow into the damaged skin .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:25 PM on 29th September 2011 . A 24-year-old woman can never take a nap on a whim, because a rare disease means falling asleep unexpectedly would kill her. Emma Chell is the second oldest woman in the UK living with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. Sufferers of the condition simply forget to breathe whenever they fall asleep due to a fault in the neurological reflex that controls breathing and there is nothing they can do about it. Sleeping soundly: Emma Chell, pictured with boyfriend Chris, must spend each night on a ventilator . Living with the condition means that Emma has never fallen asleep at her desk, had a childhood sleepover or nodded off on a train. The only way she can sleep at all is by using a special mask ventilator which breathes for her while she sleeps. She said: 'It's become a subconscious thing now because I have had the condition my whole life. 'I know I can never just nod off somewhere because I will die. If I get sleepy during the day, I just walk around and try to shake it off. 'Making sure I get a good night's sleep is really important and I don't drink apart from the odd glass as long as my mum and dad are with me because I'm scared of getting drunk and maybe passing out.' Emma spent the first two years of her life in hospital while doctors attempted to work out why she would suddenly stop breathing. Only 1 in 200,000 children are born with the condition but only around 200 people in the world currently live with it as the mortality rate is so high. Emma is one of just 30 CCHS sufferers in the UK. Also known as Ondine's curse, the condition is named after the myth of a water nymph who had an unfaithful mortal lover who swore to her that his 'every waking breath would be a testimony of his love'. Upon witnessing his adultery, she cursed that if he should fall asleep, he would forget to breathe. Speaking from the family home in Cheadle, Staffordshire, Emma's mother and full-time carer Carole, 51, said: 'My pregnancy with Emma had been completely normal right up until the moment she was born. 'She immediately turned blue and was whisked away to the neo-natal unit. At first, the doctors just wanted to monitor her but they found that every time she went to sleep she would stop breathing, her oxygen levels would drop and they would have to wake her up again. 'But they could only do that for so long as she was getting so tired and eventually they put her on a ventilator. 'None of the doctors or nurses had ever seen anything like it before. The consultant ended up ringing every children's unit in the country in search of answers.' Determined: Emma says she wants to live as normal a life as possible . Eventually, Prof Peter Fleming, professor of paediatrics at Bristol Children's Hospital diagnosed Emma with one of the UK's first cases of CCHS. She had a tracheostomy operation to insert a breathing tube into her neck, but doctors were still too afraid to allow her to go home with her parents. It wasn't until she was two years old that she was allowed home for a few hours a day. Eventually, Carole and her husband David, 56, a welder, were trained to use the ventilation machine and oxygen monitors which allowed Emma to sleep. Carole said: 'With the condition being so rare, the doctors didn't know what to expect or what her life expectancy might be. She was being ventilated nearly 24 hours a day so there was no way she could come home. 'The first night she came home was Christmas Eve and we just sat with her all night long. Both of us were too terrified to go to sleep in case something happened. 'After that, I would go to bed for half the night and David would watch her, then I would get up and let him get a few hours sleep. 'We were always tired but we had to do it for our peace of mind. Nowadays, people with CCHS have nurses seven nights a week, but for ten years we were completely on our own. 'There were a lot of scares. One time she caught the measles and clinically died in hospital. Measles is dangerous for anyone but with CCHS children it severely affects their breathing and they had to bring in a crash team to revive her.' Emma's parents were woken between 50-60 times a night by the various alarms rigged to her bedtime breathing equipment. And when Emma started school, she had to have an adult accompany her at all times, making it difficult for her to fit in and make friends. Then, last year, Emma was struck down with Meningitis C which almost proved fatal. She spent ten days in hospital recovering, during four of which she was in a coma. Once again she had amazed doctors with her incredible survival, even after her heart stopped and they were once again forced to revive her. Now, after completing a course in computing at her local college, Emma is eager to get on with her life. She spends most nights with her van-driver boyfriend Chris Mason, 29, who has had to adapt to spending his nights with a masked bedfellow. Emma said: 'Growing up was very isolating. I'd spent the first two years of my life in hospital and I wasn't able to make any sounds at all until I was 18 months old because of the traceostomy. 'Then, having an adult around all the time at school made it difficult to fit in. They even used to follow me to the toilet because the school insisted I needed supervision ""just in case"" ""It was only when I started college at 18 that things started to improve. 'All my life I had been told I couldn't do things in case something happened, but now I want to get out there and get a job and start living my life like everyone else. 'I do feel a certain duty as one of the oldest sufferers of CCHS to show that it is possible to live a normal life and that they shouldn't be afraid of the future.'","Emma is one of only 200 in the world to suffer from the condition .

"By . Nick Pisa . Last updated at 11:40 AM on 8th September 2011 . Amanda Knox is likely to be freed, according to one of the lawyers opposing her murder appeal. A prosecutor in the Amanda Knox appeal case has said 'an ill wind is blowing' as she predicted the American would be acquitted of the murder of Meredith Kercher. Manuela Comodi, who is one of two prosecutors involved in the appeal of Knox against her conviction for the murder of student Meredith, 21, said she was convinced the American would be freed. Comodi made her comments just hours before the appeal hearing resumed today, with prosecutors and defence lawyers again contesting crucial DNA evidence. Hopeful: Amanda Knox, seen here at her appeal hearing in Perugia, is another step closer to freedom after a judge's ruling today . Knox, 24, is serving 26 years for the murder of Meredith, 21, who was found with her throat slashed and semi naked in the bedroom of the house she shared with her and two other women in November 2007. Her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 27, was also convicted of murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith and he is serving 25 years with both claiming they had nothing to do with the killing. Miss Comodi said: 'There is an ill wind blowing in this case. 'The judge and his assistant are clearly against us. I can see both Knox and Sollecito being freed which will be a shame as they are both involved.' Knox is led into court in Perugia by a police officer as her appeal hearing comes towards its conclusion . The prosecutor spoke as the judge in the case denied her a further re-examination of forensic evidence. An earlier review had cast doubt on DNA findings used by the prosecution. Key to the case is a 30cm kitchen knife found at Sollecito's apartment, on which DNA from Knox was on the handle and that of Meredith was discovered on the blade. However the independent report by Carla Vecchiotti and Stefano Conte of Rome's La Sapeinza University has questioned the reliability of the findings by forensic scientists. Although they do not doubt Knox's DNA is on the handle they have questioned the findings related to Meredith, insisting that the level is so low it should not have been admitted as evidence in the first trial. The experts have also questioned the . reliability of DNA evidence found on Meredith's bloodied bra clasp which . was found at the scene and then 'missed' for six weeks. The . original trial heard there were traces of Sollecito on the clasp after . it was examined by forensic scientists but the experts say the fact it . was left for six weeks at the scene leaves it open to contamination. Police . forensic scientist Patrizia Stefanoni, who led the original . investigation, has dismissed any suggestion of contamination and . insisted she and her team followed strict guidelines. However, . earlier in the appeal the court was shown a video which showed the . forensic team collecting evidence with dirty gloves and using their . hands instead of tweezers to collect items. Raffaele Sollecito, seen left arriving at the appeal hearing in Perugia yesterday, is disputing his part in the death of student Meredith Kercher, right . Comodi added: 'We are going to ask for a second review of the evidence. There are to many aspects that are incomplete and we believe the experts are wrong so we want another review. 'This could take another sixty days but I'm not confident that the judge will grant the prosecution request - it's very obvious this time that they are against us.' Comodi said that the tests, if granted, would be carried out using new techniques which had not previously been available when the first tests were carried out almost four years ago. She also said she would request that Mafia mobster Luciano Avielli who had earlier testified that Knox and Sollecito were innocent of the murder be called back. Denial: Knox has appealed her murder conviction at the court in Perugia after always denying she played a part in Meredith Kercher's killing . Investigation: Forensic teams search the Perugian flat in November 2007 where Meredith Kercher's body was found . Aviello has told the hearing that it was his on-the-run brother and fellow mobster Antonio who had carried out the killing after he was disturbed by Meredith during a botched break in. Comodi said: 'Aviello was a key witness for the defence in this appeal but he has now contacted me to retract everything he said so it is only right that we ask for him to be called back so he can testify again.' The findings of the review had given hope to Knox and Sollecito that they would be acquitted at the end of September when the court is expected to give its verdict. However a request to have a second review plus Aviello heard again could delay a verdict by as much as two months, meaning no decision before November at the earliest - four years after Meredith was murdered. After the hearing Knox's father Curt, said: 'I'm very happy with the decision to stick with the original independent review - it's a tell tale of how the court feels the report was effective. Bereaved: Stephanie Kercher, with her mother Arline Kercher and father John Kercher in Perugia in 2007, have pleaded for their daughter to 'not be forgotten' 'The court truly believes in what the experts have told them. We are still hopeful and this tells me that the court believes what these experts are saying. 'Amanda is happy and hopeful that she won't be spending too much more time in prison but it's still up to the judges in the court and we will start those arguments later this month. 'These were court appointed experts and if you ask me it looks like an act of desperation from the prosecution. I personally didn't believe that another review was necessary. 'It seems as if they are unwilling to listen to common sense - there was no trace of Amanda or Raffaele in the room where Meredith was murdered. 'The prosecution should be seeking the truth and I'm sure that is something the Kerchers would want.' Meredith, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was in Perugia as part of her Leeds University and had only been in Italy for two months before she was brutally murdered. A third defendant, small-time drug dealer Rudy Guede, an immigrant from the Ivory Coast, was also jailed in connection with the brutal killing. He was handed a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual violence following a fast-track trial in October 2008 which was later cut to 16 years.","American closer to freedom as judge rejects calls to re-examine evidence .

New York’s fire service is not doing enough to cut down on discrimination against black people and other minorities in its recruiting, a judge claimed. The Fire Department of New York (FDNY) has not committed enough time or resources to reverse a long history of discrimination, he said. Judge Nicholas Garaufis made the damning comments about the FDNY in a memorandum after a civil trial in Brooklyn, New York. Improvements needed: The FDNY has not committed enough time or resources to reverse a long history of discrimination, a federal judge said (file picture) The U.S. Justice Department had sued the city on behalf of a fraternal organisation for black firemen called the Vulcan Society. Opinions: Judge Nicholas Garaufis made the comments about the FDNY after a civil trial in Brooklyn, New York . Judge Garaufis praised the city’s efforts to sign up record numbers for an exam but pushed for a lasting solution, reported the New York Daily News. The fire department had announced this summer that nearly half of the people who had signed up for its next exam were minorities. But only around three per cent of New York City firemen are black. Judge Garaufis is expected to spell out a remedy in a separate ruling. His ruling that the Vulcan Society of black firemen had proven its claims means a court-ordered monitor is now likely to oversee any changes, reported the New York Daily News. Judge Garaufis wrote that ‘the underrepresentation of black firefighters in the FDNY’ is ‘a direct result and vestige’ of the city’s discrimination. He added that this is ‘responsible for making blacks significantly less likely to’ work in the FDNY, without a formal recruitment programme. Angry: The Justice Department had sued the city on behalf of a black firemen organisation called the Vulcan Society, whose president is John Coombs . A city spokesman told NY1: ‘We respectfully disagree with some of the court's findings and are continuing to study this lengthy 81-page decision. 'The next steps the city will take depend on what the judge's subsequent rulings are regarding remedial steps.’ 'Whether it's systemic, whether it's intentional, whether someone didn't know they were doing it - they still broke the law,' Vulcan Society president John Coombs told NY1. Former human resources official Sherry Kavaler testified in court that white candidates with difficult pasts can often get in thanks to family links.","Fire service criticised for not reducing discrimination .

A pretty, long-haired, semi-naked young woman stands amid her friends, playing air guitar, lost in the music at an open-air festival. But now more than three decades on the woman in the shot has revealed she wasn't a drug-taking hippie chick of easy virtue, but a straight-laced married woman looking for something to do. The picture was taken at a music festival in 1978 shortly after Jennifer Wilson, now 67, moved away from her home city of Exeter in Devon to London. Rocking spirit: Jennifer Wilson, originally from Exeter, was the subject of an iconic image thanks to this old rock festival photograph that epitomised the free spirited summer of love . 'I seemed to be photographed at pop concerts every time I went,' she said. 'I used to wear unusual clothing with lots of colours - I still do but I'm trying to tone it down now I'm older. 'I didn't take drugs... I was very straight. I went to pop concerts for something to do' 'The photo could have been taken anywhere between 1975 and 1982. 'I think it was at Reading Festival while dancing to a band like Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, Genesis - it could have been any band like that. 'I used to love music when I was at school. 'The teacher used to tell us to close our eyes when listening to a piece of music so you can hear it properly and not get distracted by what's going on around you. 'I still close my eyes now when listening to a new record. 'Sometimes the photo is used with the wrong story, like drugs or promiscuity, that insinuates all sorts of things I don't like. 'I didn't take drugs, I was too naive. And I wasn't even promiscuous. 2011: Jennifer Wilson more than three decades on aged 67 was a long haired, scantily clad woman in her youth . 'I had been married for a few years at that time. I was very straight. I went to pop concerts for something to do.' Ms Wilson was the eldest of eight children, five girls and three boys, and grew up in Alphington, Exeter. She got married to an Exeter man and moved to London after her divorce aged 25, where she made a living as a dress maker. Jennifer Wilson enjoyed watching bands such as Led Zeppelin . Today she lives in East Acton with her partner of 12 years and has raised three daughters. She regularly visits Exeter, where her mother and two sisters still live, and can recall the times her dad used to take her and her brothers and sisters to watch Exeter City. 'When I divorced I started going to rock concerts as a way of trying to pick myself up off the floor,' she said. 'It was a kind of freedom after being brought up strictly and convent educated. 'I used to go to Reading and Knebworth a lot to listen to various bands. 'I can't remember them all. I remember it was a really hot day and people started to sunbathe topless. 'I looked like the odd ball with my clothes on. All the girls were going round with their tops off so I did the same. 'I couldn't believe I was the one who was photographed. It was the happiest time of a my life. I met lovely people. It was all love and peace. 'There was no violence like there is now.' Ms Wilson said she worked for a time as a Go Go dancer in London. She also spent a year living in a bus in Morocco sitting on the side of the road selling beaded headbands. 'I used to get recognised in and around Earls Court near where I lived,' she said. 'Even the bread delivery man noticed me. 'I seemed to get photographed all the time. Every time anyone sees a photo of me I try to get a copy. And a friend's son found quite a few pictures of me on a hippie website.'
