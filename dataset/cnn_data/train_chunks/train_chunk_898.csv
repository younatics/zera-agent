"By . Phil Vinter . Jailed: Tyrone Powell was sentenced to two years in prison after his friend Carlo Renzi fell from the roof of his car . A drunk driver who 'accidentally killed' his best friend who he 'loved like a brother' when a prank went wrong has been jailed for two years. Father-of-four Carlo Renzi, 31, from Swansea died when he fell from the roof of his friend's car after the pair had spent the afternoon drinking. Swansea Crown Court heard Tyrone Powell, 27, was driving near a pub in Port Tennant when Mr Renzi jumped onto the roof of his Ford Fiesta, a practise known as 'car surfing'. Mr Renzi was unable to hold on and he fell off, later dying of his injuries. His wife, Claire, who was in the car when the accident happened on November 12, said the pair were 'clowning around'. She . said: 'It was silly and foolish. It was a stupid prank that went wrong. Carlo was a clown. He loved clowning around, that's how he was.' The court was told that Mr Renzi and . Powell had consumed around six pints that afternoon during a drinking . session in Port Tennant. Mrs Renzi said her husband did not seem drunk but said he was 'full of life'. The two friends began play fighting through the window of Powell's car before he began to slowly drive away. Father-of-four Carlo Renzi, 31, from Swansea died when he fell from the . roof of his friend's Ford Fiesta after the pair had spent the afternoon drinking (file pic) Mrs Renzi said she did not know her husband had jumped onto the roof and Powell later told police he 'panicked' after seeing Mr Renzi, a former Welsh Guard, clinging onto the roof. After hearing a 'thud' he stopped the car and ran to his friend. He held him as Mrs Renzi ran to the pub to get help. Mr Renzi was pronounced dead at 8.28pm. Powell pleaded guilty to careless driving while under the influence of alcohol. His . barrister John Hipkin said: 'The defendant and Carlo were the best of . friends. He wouldn't have set out to hurt Carlo deliberately because he . loved him like a brother. 'They were always joking together. This was a joke, which as Claire Renzi said, went tragically wrong. 'This is a defendant who acknowledges the pain that he has caused to the family in question. Swansea Crown Court heard Tyrone Powell, 27, was driving near a pub in Port Tennant when Mr Renzi jumped onto the roof of his Ford Fiesta . 'There's nothing he can do to turn the clock back and bring his best friend back to those who loved him.' Judge Huw Davies QC said the case was one of the most 'unusual' he had come across. He banned Powell from driving for two years and jailing him for two years. He said: 'No sentence of imprisonment, whatever its length, could possibly reflect the tragedy of loss and hurt which the family of the deceased have experienced. 'They (the sentences) do not in any way reflect the tragedy of loss or the significance of the loss of Carlo Renzi to those who are his nearest and dearest.'","Driver had consumed six pints of alcohol earlier that day, court heard .

"By . Paul Thompson  In Pleasant Grove, Utah . The boyfriend of the Utah mom accused of killing her six newborn babies has spoken for first time of his devastation at the allegations against her. Shocked Jimmy Brady told MailOnline he had no idea about Megan Huntsman's past and has been left reeling that the woman he loved may have killed so many babies. 'I swear I had no idea, no idea what she had done in her past,' he said. 'If I had known anything about her dark past I would never have started dating her. It just does not add up. I know what has been said, but I still can't believe what they are saying about her.' Shock: Jimmy Brady, pictured left and right Tuesday, said he was shocked by the allegations against his girlfriend Megan Huntsman . This The West Valley City home was the last known residence of megan Huntsman . Brady, who lived with the 39-year-old at a trailer home in the West Valley City area of Salt Lake City, said he has not been able to sleep since Huntsman was arrested on suspicion of murder. Looking tired and drawn, he trembled as he spoke nervously drawing on a cigarette. Work colleagues said he has been left a shattered as the realization that he was living with a woman who has allegedly killed six of her newborn babies sunk in. 'Jimmy is an innocent in this.He just can't believe that the woman he loved has been accused of doing this. It is just horrendous,' said a colleague at the supermarket where he works. Brady, 37, has lived with Huntsman for over 18 months. They met at Smith's Grocery store in Pleasant Grove, the town where Huntsman lived with her three daughters. Her relationship with Brady, a father of one, resulted in her being thrown out of her marital home by her in laws. Stephen and Diane West had said she could continue to live in the three bedroom home after their son Darren was jailed on drugs charges provided she remained faithful. Lovers: Brady, who lived with the 39-year-old Huntsman, pictured, at a trailer home in the West Valley City area of Salt Lake City, said he has not been able to sleep since Huntsman was arrested on suspicion of murder . In 2011 after they learned of her affair with Brady she was told to leave - moving out and leaving behind her three daughters. Brady said his partner fell pregnant last year, but suffered a miscarriage. He said the child was not planned and Huntsman had told him she was too old to have another child. 'It wasn't planned. It just happened,' he said. Brady, who shook with emotion as he spoke with MailOnline, insisted Huntsman had never talked about her past. 'It was never spoken about. We did not talk about her past life and I had no reason to really ask,' he said. Horror find: Darren West, pictured, Megan Huntsman's estranged husband found the body of a dead baby while cleaning out his parents' house . 'I'm just a bystander in all of this. It has really shaken me up. What they are saying is not the Megan I knew.' Brady said he would look after his four-year-old son from a previous relationship on a regular basis. Neighbors said Megan and Jimmy would go out as a family. 'They looked like any other family,' said neighbor Josh Flower. 'Jimmy loved to have his kid over and they would go out to the park. Just like any other family.' Meanwhile police have confirmed that at least one of the seven corpses found at the house in Pleasant Grove was a female. The husband of the alleged baby killer has undergone a DNA test to see if he is the father of the victims. Darren West voluntarily gave police a sample of his DNA to allow a forensic scientist to confirm  if he is the father. His . wife, who is being held on $6million bond, is said to have told police all seven . babies were conceived while she was still married to the 41-year-old . construction worker. MailOnline . has revealed that she was thrown out of her home by in-laws after she . began an affair with a co-worker when Darren was jailed for nine years . on drugs offenses. Darren has denied any knowledge of his wife's claim that she strangled or suffocated six of the babies soon after birth. Huntsman, who has three daughters aged from 13 to 21, said the seventh was stillborn. Pleasant Grove Police chief Michael Smith told MailOnline West had voluntarily submitted to a DNA test. Together: The body of a stillborn baby was . discovered by Megan's estranged husband Darren West (center) this . weekend. He then called police who found six other bodies. Pictured . above with their three living daughters . Pleasant Grove Police investigate the scene at Megan Huntsman home in Pleasant Grove where seven infant bodies were discovered - packaged in separate containers - on Sunday . Josh Flowers a current neighbor of Megan Huntsman, who was arrested on Sunday of suspicion of killing six of her newborn babies over the past ten years, recalls his interactions with her outside his home on Tuesday, April 15, 2014 . He refused to speculate on the sex of the seven victims and said test results should be back in the next couple of days. He . said: 'Mr West has been fully cooperative. He has had a DNA test which . will help in determining the paternity of the seven babies. We are just . waiting on the results from the medical examiner.' Huntsman, who is on suicide watch at the Utah State jail, has claimed she gave birth to seven children between 1996 and 2006. Police . chief Smith said they had all but ruled out that the babies, who found . wrapped in blankets and in boxes in Hunstsman's home were anyone's but . hers. 'The DNA test will tell us everything,' he said. Smith said detectives had interviewed Huntsman's three daughters who have said they had no knowledge of the pregnancies. 'There is nothing to suggest they were involved,' said Smith. Huntsman was arrested on Saturday at the home she shared with her boyfriend Jimmy Brady. Neighbors at the mobile home where they had lived for the past 18 months said Huntsman had a miscarriage last year. Darren West - seen here in an earlier picture -  voluntarily gave police a sample of his DNA to allow forensic scientist to confirm if he is the father . Josh Flower, who lives next door to Huntsman, said she always seemed to adore children. 'She . would always offer her services to babysit. She really did like being . around children and had such a good way with them,' said Flowers. 'That . is what makes this so hard to understand. How can someone who says she . loves looking after children be the same person who then apparently . suffocates seven of her own babies. It just does not make any sense.' Flowers, 34, said more than 20 police officers and forensic teams had descended on Huntsman's home at the weekend. He . said Brady was attending his mother's funeral and returned home to find . their home in the West Valley City area of Salt Lake City surrounded by . police. 'It was just . unreal. They said they were here to look for more evidence, I guess to . see if any babies were buried here,' said Flowers. 'They were here a few hours and then left without finding anything.'","Shocked Jimmy Brady, of Salt Lake City, told MailOnline he had no idea about Megan Huntsman's past .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Ashley Collman . and Paul  Thompson . A third student has come forward to accuse a 29-year-old Florida teacher already facing nearly two dozen charges for sex with teens in her school. Jennifer Fichter now faces 34 separate criminal charges for having sexual relationships with at least three students in separate schools where she taught English. The third student was between the ages of 16 and 17-years-old when his relationship with Fichter turned physical, sources told WKMG. More charges: English teacher Jennifer Fichter is facing more than 30 counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor after a third student came forward alleging he had a relationship with her. Pictured above in court last month . Fichter and the student are believed by authorities to have had sexual contact from August 2012 to December 2012, the station reported. Detectives had been interviewing the Polk County teen at the time the disgraced teacher was arrested for the previous cases. The second student, now 20, was also 17 in September 2011 when Fichter started inviting him over to her apartment where they would cuddle on the couch and watch TV. He says the relationship turned sexual the next month and they went on to have intercourse about 20 times for seven months - sometimes in the boy's bedroom while his mother was away, according to the arrest report. Allegations: The third student says he had a relationship with Fichter in 2012, when he was just 16 years old . Fichter was initially arrested in April . after the mother of one of Central Florida Aerospace Academy's juniors . found intimate text messages from the teacher on her son's phone. Fichter was charged then with six counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor, and was charged with 20 more counts on Wednesday after the second student's revelations. Neither teen has been identified. The new charges come just one day after the Polk County School Board voted unanimously to fire Fichter after an investigation into the affair she had with the current student. According to The Tampa Tribune, police said the abuse with the current student began in November 2011 when the pair had sex in the early morning hours in Fichter's Toyota pickup truck. The teen told detectives he and Fichter met for sex three times in the parking lot of a Lakeland apartment complex and three times near New Tampa Highway. He also said they had sex four times outside the city in Polk and Hillsborough. Lakeland police said those counties are investigating those incidents. The illegal meetings were discovered by the teen's suspicious mother on January 27. When she noticed her son was not home at 5am and lied about his whereabouts, she looked through his cell phone and found texts from two names. One discussed an 'age difference'. Police said the mom confronted her son, who admitted both names were used by Fichter. Scene: The first two students to come forward with accusations attended Central Florida Aerospace Academy, where Fichter taught English. The school fired her last month . The mother reported Fichter to police, however it is not clear why she waited so long. The mother also agreed to speak to the teacher and record the conversation for investigators. During . the call, Fichter allegedly admitted she became pregnant with the . teen's child and had an abortion. The woman also said she was in love with . the student and wanted to continue seeing him. 'The victim's mother discovered this relationship after reviewing text messages from her son and she asked that Fichter respond to her residence to talk,' a Lakeland police statement said, according to Orlando Sentinel. 'According to the victim's mother, Fichter admitted to the sexual encounters and professed her love for him,' authorities said. Fichter was arrested at her Davenport home soon after the conversation, and booked at the Polk County Jail. And the two students at the space academy aren't the only boys Fichter is accused of abusing. Fichter resigned from her job at Robinswood Middle School in Orange County in 2008 after it was reported she had feelings for an eighth-grade student. Fichter is now in jail after being accused of having sex with at least one minor as many as 30 times in the backseat of her truck . A 40-page report on the English teacher revealed that she told another teacher she had feelings for the boy, and hinted to another student that she wanted to have sex with him. She reportedly said ‘he makes me melt into a puddle with those eyes.’ Her co-worker told investigators that she told her she even dreamed about the boy one night. When asked what it was about, she said, ‘Oh my goodness, it was a goooood dream!’ The report said Fichter and her colleague joked that the remark could get her jailed if ever revealed. An investigation was launched into her feelings for the 14 year old boy. No charges were ever filed in relation to that incident.

"By . Martha De Lacey . Online matchmaking, singles' nights, speed dating, dating apps, blind dates... when did finding love become such an almighty palaver? Wouldn't it be easier if you could just spot the nearest singleton a mile off? Or, at least, some 10 metres off? Perhaps if they were wearing, say, a recognisable 'I'm free!' wristband? It may sound preposterous, but that's precisely the thinking behind a new loved-up start-up powered by Danish-British couple Rina Mardahl and Rob Young, whose whirlwind romance and continued relationship inspired the MY Single Band - named MY after the partners' surnames - a coloured rubber bracelet with which they hope to unite singles all over the world. The new MY Single Band bracelet aims to take some of the complication out of looking for love, enabling singletons to easily spot each other . The British-Danish collaboration behind MY Single Band recognised the difficulty in meeting other singles and set about creating a single identifier that would appeal to the mass market . Launching now in the UK and in America in a few weeks, Rina and Rob say the band should help 'increase new encounters, lower the fear of first introductions, and suit busy modern lifestyles'. Claiming the bands could 'change the face of dating forever', they continue: 'The launch of MY Single Band is a revolutionary concept. When worn, the band visibly identifies that the wearer is single, just like a wedding ring shows you are married. 'MY Single Band not only impresses upon others that there is so much choice out there, but also where that choice lies.' The couple say they recognised the difficulty in meeting other singles and set about 'creating a single identifier that would appeal to the mass market'. The silicone wristbands, priced £6 for one or £10 for two, are designed in seven different colours and embossed with the words fate, destiny and future. Speaking to MailOnline, Rob said: 'We . recognised that as the population of single adults continues to rise across . every age group, they need new and innovative ways to connect. 'Online dating . provides one method but cannot measure chemistry and it doesn’t help when you . are out and about, which is of course most of the day. 'Whilst working at my previous office of 3,500 people, I realised that I saw hundreds of . people each day that could potentially be a suitable partner, yet there was no . way of knowing their relationship status.' The new colourful wristbands enable you to identify a potential date's availability without having to ask . Rob and Rina met on holiday in Lanzarote, and their relationship is now both personal and professional . The couple talked about how lucky they had been to bump into each other on holiday in Lanzarote, but and 'how so many people must miss out on . meeting their soul mate by not saying the first hi'. Rob continued: 'We began to question the . laid back approach to meeting other singes that most of us take and decided . that a single identifier would be of huge benefit to singles.' The couple built the website mysingleworld.com to promote MY Single Band but . also to provide a central resource for single people. 'There's a tendency to . think of the notion ""single and alone"", yet we want to promote ""single and . together"". 'There are literally hundreds of millions of singles, yet finding one . for you has always been comparable to a needle in a haystack. 'Yet it was always . going to be hard when single, as a relationship status, is visually completely . invisible. 'With MY Single Band you don’t have to go looking for single . hot-spots, just wear the attractive band and your perfect partner could be just . around the next corner.' Would you wear one? The bands come in a range of colours, are embossed with the words fate, future or destiny, and cost £6 for one or £10 for two .","MY Single Band aims to help singletons around the world spot one another .

"By . Paul Thompson  In Pleasant Grove, Utah . The 39-year-old Utah mother who has admitted killing six of her newborn babies was thrown out of her home by her in-laws after she began an affair while her husband was prison, MailOnline can reveal. Megan Huntsman was told to leave the home she shared with her three daughters when she cheated on her husband Darren. Her in-laws Stephen and Diane West, who owned the home where she lived, told her to leave in 2011 after finding out about the affair. Huntsman, who is being held on $6million bail, is alleged to have told detectives the babies found dead in her home, were conceived with her now-estranged husband. Gruesome: Utah mom Megan Huntsman (left) has been arrested after admitting to killing six of her newborn babies but her estranged husband Darren West (right), who was just recently released from a drug-related sentence, is not considered a suspect and police believe he had no idea . Together: The body of a stillborn baby was discovered by Megan's estranged husband Darren West (center) this weekend. He then called police who found six other bodies. Pictured above with their three living daughters . But news of the affair raises the . question that some of the babies who were strangled or smothered at . birth might have been born as a result of an extra-marital cheating. Darren West has also told police he had no knowledge of the babies. Aaron Hawker, who lives next door, said he had spoken with West since he made the shocking discovery of the skeletal remains. 'He has told me he has no idea where the babies come from, ' said Mr Hawker. 'He has insisted that they were not his.' Huntsman admitted to killing the children in a period between 1996 and 2006, and police believe she was still with her husband at the time. They have ordered DNA tests to determine the paternity of the murdered children. Former home: Meghan lived at her in-law's home (pictured above) after her husband was incarcerated in 2006. After allegedly having an affair, the Wests kicked her out of the house. The bodies were found as her estranged husband was cleaning out the garage . Mr Hawker, 73, said he was told by West that Huntsman was told to leave the marital home after she began an affair. Her in-laws had agreed to let her to live in the three bedroom home after their son was jailed in 2006 on drugs charges. According to Mr Hawker, one condition was that she must stay faithful to her husband while he was inside and not see any other men. 'What I was told by Darren was that she began an affair and when her in-laws found out they told her to leave. I do not know how long the affair went on for, but was told that it was with a co-worker. Broken promise? Neighbor Aaron Hawker (pictured) says one of the conditions of Meghan staying with her in-laws during her husband's incarceration was that she stay faithful to him . 'Megan left in 2011 and since then we have hardly ever seen her at the house. She would not come back very often and was told she was not welcome in the house.' Time spent behind bars: In 2006, Darren West (pictured) was sentenced to nine years in prison on drug charges. He was just recently released . When Huntsman left, her eldest daughter Darien had just turned 18 with the next youngest Jaycee, aged 17 and the youngest Sawyer aged 11. An aunt Mary West moved into the home to help look after the girls. The two eldest daughters are now adults and the youngest is a teenager. 'We used to see the girls from time to time and they were just your average girls,' said Mr Hawker. 'I think the older ones were looking forward to dating. I have not see them since the bodies were found.' Mr Hawker admitted that he never saw Megan pregnant or even put on any weight. 'It is a complete mystery to me and my wife Kathie. Megan was always very shy, but she was very nice.' Mr Hawker said he wrote to her husband West after he was given a nine-year jail sentence on drugs charges. He said he considered the sentence harsh as West claimed he had only agreed to take in a package for a friend after being offered $200. 'I thought the sentence was unjust and liked Darren. He was a lovely man and I had a lot of time for him. 'I would write to him in prison and when he got out he came to see us. We were glad he was moving back into the house.' West was released earlier this year and was at his home in the town of Pleasant Grove, abut 35 miles from Salt Lake City when he made the horrifying discovery of the bodies. He called his wife after opening one of the boxes to find a corpse of what is believed to be the seventh still born baby. She is alleged to have told him it was her baby. Connections: Megan Huntsman is in jail but she and her estranged husband have three teenage and adult daughters, though the young woman seen leaving the home has not been identified . Questions: Huntsman's youngest daughter, who is in junior high, was born during the same time period when she murdered her other babies and it is not clear why she was spared (an unidentified person pictured above at the family home on Monday) Getting out of the house: A friend was seen helping the person in sweats get bags out of the home on Monday . Horrible job: An unidentified man was seen going in and out of the Pleasant Grove house on Monday . When police carried out a search of the garage they found six other babies. Each had been wrapped in a towel and placed in a box. Police have said Megan has admitted to strangling or smothering six of the babies  after carrying them full term. She said the seventh was still born. Growing belly: Neighbor SanDee Wall often noticed Meghan sporting a baby bump, but never commented on it . While Mr Hawker did not ever suspect Megan was pregnant another next door neighbor suspected on several occasions that she was carrying a child. 'I would see her walk up the driveway and she would have the smallest of bumps on her stomach,' said 70-year-old SanDee Wall. 'I thought to myself of several occasions she must be pregnant, but I did not like to say anything to her. 'Megan was so shy and not the sort of person who would engage in conversation.' Ms Wall said after Huntsman's husband was jailed she would often see her the worse for wear for drink. 'I . would also smell pot quite a lot and on many occasions I would see her . drunk.That could have been one of the reasons she was asked to leave the . house.' Neighbors in the quiet, tree lined street are puzzled as to how Hunstman was able to conceal so many pregnancies from her husband. Although he worked in the construction industry he was home most nights and rarely away from his family. 'I had two of my last children at home then and as any mother who has given birth knows it can be very messy,"" said Mrs Wall. 'I just don't understand how she could have concealed so many babies from her husband.' West has refused to comment since making the shocking discovery in his garage. His parents have also declined to comment after earlier issuing a statement expressing their shock at the death of the babies.","Megan Huntsman, 33, was arrested Sunday for allegedly killing six of her newborn babies and hiding them, along with a stillborn seventh child .

"By . Associated Press . Iekhan Safar moved from Iraq to Lincoln for the same reason that hundreds of Yazidis, a Kurdish religious minority, came to Nebraska's capital city: to live near family, far from the dangers they've long faced as a persecuted group. Lincoln has the largest concentration of Yazidis (yah-ZEE-dees) in the United States, and many of them brought their families to the U.S. after receiving visas for serving as translators during the first Gulf War. Now, the city is at the center of a frantic effort to draw attention to the group's plight in northern Iraq, where Yazidis are fleeing from Islamic State militants to escape violence and attempts to convert them to Islam. Scroll down for video . Members of the Yazidi community in LIncoln, Neb., Iekham Safar, left, her husband Ismaeil Khalaf, right, and Ismaeil's sister Gulie Khalaf, discuss the plight of the Yazidis in Iraq . Half a world away from the turmoil in Iraq, the largest concentration of Yazidis in United States is trying desperately to save their persecuted relatives in northern Iraq by pressing Nebraska's congressional delegation for help . Thousands of homeless Yazidi families are . packed into a refugee camp on a remote desert Sinjar mountain range . near the country's northern border, where there is little access to . food, water or shelter. Safar, a 26-year-old mother of three, . says her sisters and their children face an uncertain future there. One . sister called this week in tears: Her 3-year-old daughter fell off a . cliff and died in the rush to escape the extremists. 'I just hope they bring them here. At least they'd be safe,' Safar said through tears in her Lincoln apartment. 'They don't want (government) help — no Medicaid, food stamps, nothing like that. They'll work hard. They just want their kids to be safe.' Yazidis in Lincoln say they're grateful for the humanitarian airdrops and airstrikes against militants that President Barack Obama ordered last week, but fearful that their loved ones can no longer live peacefully in Iraq. Ghazalah Mourad holds a photograph that she said shows refugees fleeing into the mountains from Sinjar, Iraz . Ismaeil Khalaf watches television reports on the condition of the Yazidis in Iraq from his LIncoln, Neb., home . Uncertain of what to do, Yazidis staged a hastily organized rally at the Nebraska Capitol and the governor's residence this month and reached out to U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, who along with four other congressmen sent a letter to Obama calling for immediate humanitarian assistance. They also sent five vans of people to Washington to appeal to the State Department, asking for food, water and protection for their relatives. Yazidis — also spelled 'Yezidis' — have suffered religious persecution for generations because of their beliefs, which include some elements similar to Christianity, Judaism and other ancient religions. Many Muslims consider them devil worshippers, an accusation that Yazidis strongly dispute. Those who didn't flee into the mountains are still in their homes in the town of Sinjar, making whispered phone calls to relatives in Lincoln as extremists roam the streets outside. Relatives have received reports of women in northern Iraq being raped or having body parts cut off, and Yazidis being threatened with death if they don't convert to Islam, said Laila Khoudeida, a spokeswoman for the Lincoln community. Iekhan Safar holds her sons Lazgin Khalaf, 2 and Ghamgin Khalaf, 4, in LIncoln, Neb. Demonstrators march from the Nebraska Capitol to the Cornhusker Hotel in Lincoln, Neb., as they try to raise awareness about ethnic minorities who are under attack in Iraq . Khoudeida said Yazidis in the U.S. are asking for continued military protection and possible asylum for those left homeless. If granted, many would likely join relatives in Lincoln, where roughly half the nation's Yazidi population — about 200 families — lives. The first families came over to the United States in two waves — after the first Gulf War and then the U.S. invasion in 2003 — under a special visa for military translators and congregated in Buffalo, New York, and Atlanta. Church groups in Lincoln and volunteer families heard about the Yazidis' situation and offered to help, said Gulie Khalaf, Safar's sister-in-law and a sixth-grade teacher in Lincoln. The population slowly grew in the city about 40 miles southwest of Omaha, which was quieter and offered less poverty and crime than the bigger cities. 'Once a small group of relatives establishes a home base somewhere, it serves as a magnet for other families,' said Sebastian Maisel, a professor of Middle East Studies at Grand Valley State University in Michigan who has extensively researched Yazidis. 'It's the way that many communities from the Middle East like to live. They rely on a support network in the larger community.' The first members of the religious minority group came the Lincoln, Nebraska, in the 1990s, and more than 200 families have now made it their home . Safar's husband came to the U.S. with his family in the 1990s after spending seven years with his siblings and parents in a refugee camp in Syria. He eventually made it to Lincoln. Safar joined him and some of his family in 2006, but her sisters remain overseas and under attack. 'For Yazidis, it's no longer safe to be in the Middle East,' Khalaf said. 'The Middle Eastern countries' rules and laws do not protect religious minorities.'","Lincoln, Neb., has the highest concentration of Yazidis, a Kurdish religious minority, in the U.S.

"By . Katy Winter . Brazil's loftiest teen is set to become the world's tallest bride after her compact fiancee popped the big question. Aspiring model Elisany da Cruz Silva - who is a staggering 6ft 8ins tall - has been dating 5ft 4ins Francinaldo da Silva Carvalho for more than three years. Despite a massive 1ft 4ins between them, Francinaldo had no problem increasing the distance by dropping to one knee after a romantic stroll along the beach. Scroll down for video . With well over a foot difference between their heights, Elisany and Francinaldo have more difficulty than most couples kissing after becoming engaged . Brazil's tallest teen Elisany Da Silva accepts her new fiancee Francinaldo Carvalho's proposal on March 29, 2014 in Salinopolis, Brazil . The lovestruck pair have shared a small home in the Brazilian town of Salinopolis for one year and are hoping to soon hear the pitter patter of tiny feet. Elisany is so stuck on having a child that she is willing to adopt if she does not fall pregnant soon - despite being only 18. The youngster is worried that she may not conceive because of a form of gigantism that was caused when a tumour grew on her pituitary gland. Despite this the couple are still looking forward to a long and happy life together. Remembering the romantic proposal, Elisany said: 'I told him many times, 'do not ask me to marry you because my answer will be no' - I think that's what he was thinking. 'I was so nervous when I saw him there. I don't even know how I coped.' Construction worker Francinaldo added: 'I have always wanted to go out with a tall girl and she came and fitted into that perfectly.' Despite planning a long engagement, Elisany has already picked out her wedding dress . Elisany's height still draws stares, even in her hometown, but Francinaldo says the attention doesn't bother him and he is proud to show her off . The couple are planning on a long engagement despite Elisany already having a dress for the big day. 'We think how will the preparations for the wedding be, the church, the best men and bridesmaids,' added Francinaldo. 'We have taken just one step towards the wedding - which was me asking her to marry me. 'We are giving it some time to get it all in order.' The newly engaged couple have not always seen eye to eye and Francinaldo had to work hard to get the ring on Elisany's finger. 'When we met I had already turned 16,' she said. 'I was still a bit childish and so I was just playing around with him for a while and I got so annoyed with him - as if he was a rival that I hated. 'I just didn't like him and wanted to hit him every time we met.' But little Francinaldo has a big heart and remembers their meeting a little differently. He said: 'The first time I saw her I went to get some bread and I noticed her from a distance. 'I checked her out and she also checked me out straight away. 'Then I just thought, ""I need to be with that girl"". I always found her beautiful.' The newly engaged couple have not always seen eye to eye and Francinaldo had to work hard to get the ring on Elisany's finger, but the couple now can not wait to wed . And the hate eventually turned to love for Elisany when she became jealous of Francinaldo's prowess with the ladies. 'He was talking to another girl and I was jealous,' she said. 'He intrigued me - I wanted to know more about him.' Despite the pair being completely in love, not everyone is as happy about the new engagement. Elisany's mother, Ana Maria Ramos, said: 'I don't know how this could happen - this proposal. 'It was a surprise - no-one was expecting it. Elisany seen here as a young, aspiring model,  is so stuck on having a child that she is willing to adopt if she does not fall pregnant soon - despite being only 18 . 'In spite of everything she is still a very young girl with a lot ahead of her. 'She is sometimes a bit difficult to him but I've never seen him treating her badly. 'He has been an excellent person.' Elisany still draws stares while walking down the street where she has lived her entire life and is often referred to as the giant girl. Francinaldo said: 'I keep telling her to get out more so that people don't feel so curious about her.'When we go for a walk people keep staring saying 'look at that giant girl'. 'It really bothers me because people don't have the consciousness of thinking that she's also a human being.' But despite drawing stares Francinaldo cannot wait to show off his new fiancie. He added: ' am always boasting about being with her. 'Everyone thinks she is beautiful - my friends think she is beautiful. 'They always ask me to take her to meet them but she won't go because she's embarrassed. 'She is a person that is very different and I know I can make her happy. 'Our relationship is special because she understands me and I understand her.'","Elisany suffers from gigantism from a tumour on her pituitary gland .

"By . Alex Finnis For Mail Online . We don't know of they were hidden by the Wicked Witch or just lost somewhere over the rainbow, but a pair of incredibly rare paintings used to plan the filming of timeless movie The Wizard of Oz have emerged for sale - 75 years after its release. The watercolours came from the brush of famed art director Jack Martin Smith and showed how the sets might look once filming of the Hollywood classic began. One of the paintings features Dorothy - who was  played by child star Judy Garland - and two Munchkins walking down the Yellow Brick Road to Oz while the other shows Dorothy with the Scarecrow. One of the  incredibly rare paintings, done by art director Jack Martin Smith, shows Dorothy and the Scarecrow. They were used to help plan out the Hollywood classic so crews could see how the costumes and sets look . The second shows Dorothy on the Yellow Brick Road. Both are expected to sell for more than $6,500 . Smith produced the 25ins by 18ins artworks so the film's crew could see how characters, costumes and sets would look during the revered 1939 musical. It is thought that after filming was over, the studio - Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer - sold off the paintings. Little is known about where they were until they surfaced at an estate sale in the late 1980s. The current owner instantly recognised the two paintings as scenes from The Wizard of Oz and snapped them up for a small sum of money. She has kept them preserved for the past 25 years but has now decided the time is right to sell them. The current owner has had the paintings for 25 years after finding them at an estate sale in the late 1980s . Jack Martin Smith was the lead artist and at the time would have just created these artworks very quickly, but he was exceptionally skilled and they are now viewed as art in their own right . Each painting is tipped to fetch around $6,700 when they go under the hammer at Heritage Auctions in Beverly Hills, California. Margaret Barrett, head of entertainment, said: 'Before filming started, the production crew's art team painted quick, off-the-cuff paintings of scenes which were then shown to the art director. 'He would then be able to plan how scenes were going to look before filming began.

In a similar scene to one of those painted, a frightened looking Scarecrow cowers behind Dorothy in the film . 'He went on to become one of the most famous art directors in Hollywood. 'When filming ended they were sold by the film studio. A woman then bought them at an estate sale 25 years ago, not as an investment but because she liked them. 'The Wizard of Oz is a beloved all-time classic and there is very high demand for memorabilia from the film. 'These two paintings are very special and are attracting interest from all over the world.' The Wizard of Oz was based on L. Frank Baum's 1900 book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. It is one of the best-loved films of all time, but on its release it was a commercial failure, making only $200,000  profit. It was nominated for six Oscars but lost out to Gone with the Wind. It was only when it started being shown on television in the mid 50s that people fell in love with it. The auction will take place on August 23.","Two paintings shows Dorothy with the scarecrow and on Yellow Brick Road .

"By . Steve Hopkins . Three England fans deported from Portugal during the Euro 2004 football championships have been told to return to face charges of rioting. Portuguese authorities have named them as arguidos - or suspects - and ordered them to stand trial, with possible jail sentences of five years if convicted. The charges are said to date back to June that year when hundreds of England fans clashed with police in Albufeira on the Algarve. The charges the men face date back to June 2004 when hundreds of England fans, like the one seen above, clashed with police in Albufeira, on the Algarve, during Euro 2004 . Several dozen England supporters were arrested and deported after summary court hearings, but after arriving back in the UK they were told by British police that no further action would be taken . Several dozen England supporters were arrested and deported after summary court hearings. After arriving back in the UK they were told by British police that no further action would be taken. Some 21 other England fans were considered for belated prosecution, but because of the time delay they are unlikely to be returned. Meanwhile officials say they have until December to prosecute these three, the report said. Builder Richard Freeman, from Berkshire, denies being involved in the disturbances and said: 'It’s the first I’ve heard of it. After all this time, it’s a farce. I’ve no idea what to do. If I go back what chance have I got of a fair trial? If I don’t go, they might extradite me,' he told Sky News. Newly-wed Lewis Andrews, from Oxfordshire, said: 'I’m not going to court because they might arrest me again. A bloodied England fan injured during clashes with police in Albuferia during Euro 2004 . 'I was just walking back to my hotel doing nothing when police attacked me with batons. Why are they bringing this up now, after 10 years?' The third suspect named by the court is Wayne Finney, from Nottinghamshire, Sky said. His girlfriend said he knew nothing about the new court hearing. Kent fireman Garry Mann, who is not facing further action, was arrested during the clashes and convicted after a brief trial. Six years after he was deported he was extradited to Portugal and imprisoned. Kent fireman Garry Mann, seen being led to a courthouse in Albufeira, was sentenced to two years jail . He returned to Britain in May 2011, having served half his two-year prison sentence in Portugal, and was released in August 2011 from Wandsworth Prison in south-west London. The father-of-six, who always claimed he was not given a fair trial, said when freed: 'I am glad to be back home with my family. 'It was a tough experience to be so far away from home but I’m hoping to finally get on with my life now.' A Birmingham City supporter, he was drinking with friends in a bar in Albufeira when a riot involving football fans began in a nearby street. He was arrested, tried and convicted within 48 hours in a case that was described by his supporters as a 'travesty of justice'. His legal team said he was only granted five minutes with a lawyer before trial, could not understand the proceedings and did not know what charge he faced until after he was convicted.","The men face possible jail sentences of five years if convicted .

"By . Sophie Borland . GP surgeries will be given Ofsted style ratings and the worst will be shut down. The care watchdog will start inspecting all 8,000 practices this October and grading them 'outstanding', 'good', 'requires improvement' or 'inadequate.' Those rated inadequate will be placed in special measures if they fail to improve within six months – or in the worst cases, immediately. This will mean they will be put under close supervision by the Care Quality Commission watchdog and NHS officials and given a series of targets. GP surgeries will be graded 'outstanding', 'good', 'requires improvement' or 'inadequate' from October (file picture) If they fail to meet these targets and are deemed to be providing unsafe care, they will be closed down. This is the first national inspection of GP surgeries and the CQC says it cannot say how many could be put in special measures. But pilot checks on 900 practices last year by the watchdog found that 1 in 3 were failing to meet basic standards in one area of care. It included two which were infected with maggots and nine where standards were so poor they could affect thousands of patients. If the CQC's inspectors uncover concerns about a particular GP they will be referred to the General Medical Council who could decide to strike them off or suspend them. Professor Steve Field, a senior GP and Chief Inspector of General Practice at the CQC said; 'Most GP practices provide good care. 'We have confirmed this in our pilot inspections so far. But we can't allow those that provide poor care to continue to let their patients have an inadequate service. Pilot checks on 900 practices last year by the watchdog found that 1 in 3 were failing to meet basic standards in one area of care (file picture) 'I want to do all I can to drive up standards in those that are not providing the services people deserve. 'We need to have a clear framework and a process to respond to those GP practices that are providing inadequate care to ensure that they can't continue to provide inadequate care indefinitely. 'Special measures will firstly promote improvement, but where practices do not improve, working with NHS England we will call time on poor care. 'Special measures will be viewed as the final chance for a practice to improve.' In December the CQC published findings of its pilot inspections of 900 practices which showed 300 were failing in at least one standard. They included patients being given out-of-date medicines or injections, and nurses not trained in basic first aid. In ten cases the failings were so severe they could potentially affect thousands of patients, the CQC warned at the time. But the GP's union the British Medical Association warned that the tough new inspections could create a blame culture. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, Chair of the BMA's GP committee, said: 'GPs care passionately about their patients, and it is only right that they should receive the best standards of care regardless of the GP practice they are registered with. 'However, it is important not to create a counterproductive blame culture based on isolated examples that would wrongly damage patient trust in wider GP services.' Niall Dickson, chief executive of the General Medical Council, said: 'Whenever CQC's new inspection system raises concerns about the competency of individual GPs, the matter will be referred to the GP's local Responsible Officer and if necessary to the GMC. 'Family doctors are now subject to regular checks, but the inspections in England are bound to expose areas of weakness as well as good practice. 'We will work closely with CQC and local Responsible Officers to help drive up standards.' Mike Bewick, Deputy Medical Director for NHS England, the body overseeing the running of the NHS said: 'Our vision is to see general practice play an even stronger role in the heart of local communities, offering more joined up, high quality services. As part of this, we want to help GPs to provide ever higher standards of care to patients.'","Care watchdog will start inspecting all 8,000 practices this October .

"By . Martha Kelner . Follow @@marthakelner . To her family, doubtless she is just mum. But to the wider world Jo Pavey is the supermum of British sport. Just 11 months after having her second child, she won gold in the 10,000m at the European athletic championships on Tuesday night. Yesterday she was reflecting on her victory, made all the more astonishing as it came just a month before her 41st birthday. Hands on mum: Jo Pavey is pictured hugging her daughter Emily in the wake of her victory on Tuesday night . Warm embrace: Mrs Pavey's 40-year-old husband Gavin then lifts up their son Jacob so that she can kiss him . Record breaker: Mrs Pavey celebrates winning gold in the 10,000m at the European athletic championships . It makes her the oldest woman European champion in history. Mrs Pavey, who was still breastfeeding baby Emily until four months ago, is also mother to four-year-old Jacob. Immediately after her victory in Zurich – the biggest achievement of her lengthy career – the Devon-born athlete pushed her way through the crowds to embrace her two children and husband Gavin, 40, who is also her coach. This personal moment in the packed Letzigrund Stadium was an acknowledgement, she later said, of the ‘little family’ who have made her a more ‘more balanced’ athlete. Dubbed ‘supermum’ by the Swiss media, the four-time Olympian ran 20 miles a week while pregnant and her husband has been seen conducting training sessions with Emily strapped to his chest in a baby carrier. She said . that having her children there for her win, which comes just 10 days . after she took a bronze medal in the 5,000m at the Commonwealth Games, . made it that much more special. Starting early: Mrs Pavey and her husband run with their son James, who likes to join in on training sessions. Her win at the European Championships came just 10 days after she took bronze in the Commonwealth Games . New mother: Jo Pavey, pictured with husband Gavin and their son James in 2009, won gold in the 10,000m race just 11 months after giving birth to second child, a daughter named Emily . She said: ‘We decided to bring them both along (to . Zurich). ‘It made me really emotional to have her watch it, . its the first time she’s seen me run in a major championships. My . little boy, too, of course. I can’t believe it, I really enjoyed it but . I’m really surprised. ‘I’ve had so many kind messages. I’ve been told I’ve inspired busy mums to get out there and get fit but also people of an older age who thought maybe they were past their best in sporting terms.’ Demonstrating remarkable powers of . recovery, Mrs Pavey took the lead with one lap to go and accelerated down the . home straight, resisting the challenge of silver medallist Clemence . Calvin of France, who is 16 years her junior. Coach: Pavey described her family's unconventional training sessions, where her husband and coach Gavin, pictured with Jo in 1998, instructs drills with baby Emily strapped to his chest . It . is a first major title for Mrs Pavey, who replaces Russia’s Irina Khabarova . as the oldest gold medallist in the 80-year history of these . championships after winning just one month before her 41st birthday. Khabarova won the 4x100m relay title in 2006 aged 40 years and 27 days. Mrs Pavey said of her new record: ‘That’s a really nice statistic to have. It is quite an honour.’ A model of consistency, the Exeter Harrier has never . finished lower than fifth in her three previous European Championships. She won silver in Helsinki two years ago behind Portugal’s Ana Dulce . Felix and on paper was the fifth fastest athlete this year on the start . line. She . made things difficult for herself, running wide in lane two for much of . the race. After hovering in eighth place in the middle of the leading . pack, she moved into third with two laps to go before taking the lead on . the 25th and final lap. Family time: Jo and Gavin Pavey with their son James in 2011. The couple took both their children to the Zurich competition and Jo said that it made her feel emotional knowing that her daughter had seen her win . Family affair: Jo and Gavin Pavey include their children in training sessions, with four-year-old son James copying his mother as she sprints down the track . Victory . looked assured 80 metres from the line. She appeared overwhelmed, . looking at the clock before raising her tired arms in a deliriously . happy daze. ‘I . bet people are criticising me for running wide so much,’ she said. ‘But . every time I tried to tuck in I got spiked. I got a bit worried about . it, thinking, “this feels a really long way, maybe I should have just . done the 5k” but then I thought maybe everyone else was thinking it’s a . long way too! ‘I . tried to do a controlled last lap because I didn’t want to blow up on . the home straight, then I didn’t know how close the other girls were, so . I thought, “just give it all you’ve got and you can’t regret . anything”.’ It . was a poignant moment for Pavey, a prodigious junior athlete who set a . British Under 15 record for the 1500m in 1988 but spent most of the . following decade blighted by injury. Early career: Jo Pavey (right) running in the Southern Road Relays in 1990. She became the oldest woman ever to claim gold at a European Championships when she won gold on Tuesday . She added: ‘It’s quite funny really, to try for so many years and now do it when I’m 40.’ Mrs Pavey now wants to compete in the Rio Olympics in Brazil in 2016 when she will be 42. However, she said her most important role in life is not that of a record breaking athlete, but being a good mother. So strong was her desire to have children, she decided not to wait until her running career was over. She . said: ‘I got to a certain age and thought “what am I doing?”. The fact I . hadn’t got any children made me start to not enjoy the sport, because . ultimately becoming a mum is more important than anything to me. Celebration: The athlete celebrates her second medal at a major championship in just 10 days . Champion: Pavey crosses the line to win her first career title at the age of 40 . ‘Running . has given us more time together as a family, not less…we’re just based . at home because of running which is a lovely side of it. I’m a total . hands-on mum at all times. I wouldn’t have it any other way.’ Mrs Pavey will now attempt to do a distance double by winning the 5,000m on Saturday. Meanwhile, the . Great Britain team will expect to add more medals on Wednesday when Mo . Farah is favourite to emulate Pavey’s success in the men’s 10,000m. The . 100m trio of Dwain Chambers, James Dasaolu and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey . thrived on the speedy Mondo track. All . won their heats with Dasaolu, the second fastest European in history . behind Linford Christie, the slowest of the three but the most . comfortable. Making it hard: Pavey ran most of the race on the outside of lane two before taking a final-lap lead . The . 26-year-old has struggled with a hamstring injury since running 9.91sec . last year but he claims to be in better shape than ever. ‘I wasn’t . really pushing myself,’ said Dasaolu. ‘I’m expecting a medal, . hopefully.’ Dwain . Chambers, competing in his sixth European Championships at 36, also . eased up in 10.18sec and admitted he was in a race against time to win . another medal. ‘The door is closing on me,’ he said. ‘I want to hear the . national anthem again.’ Christine . Ohuruogu, who originally planned 2014 as a year off from athletics, set . a season’s best of 51.42sec to win her heat and qualify second fastest . for this evening’s 400m semi-final. The . reigning world champion was contesting only her third race of the year . and eased up with 70m to run.

"By . Lucy Crossley For Mailonline . Jealous: Geoffrey Pearson, 45, has been jailed after he attacked his ex-partner with a claw hammer after she told him she was seeing someone else . A jealous father who attacked his ex-partner with a hammer because she had started a relationship with another man has been jailed. Geoffrey Pearson attacked Helen Crozier on the doorstep of her home in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, after she told him she was seeing someone else. Newcastle Crown Court heard the 45-year-old had aimed the clawed weapon at the mother's head, but she was able to put up her hand to fend off the blows. The 46-year-old victim suffered a puncture wound to the hand as well as a bruised and swollen legs. Pearson, of Hartlepool, who has a conviction for violence on a previous partner, pleaded guilty to assault and was jailed for eight months, as Judge Sean Morris told him that it was 'pure luck' the victim did not suffer more serious injury. Neil Pallister, prosecuting, told the court Pearson had turned up at Miss Crozier’s door on May 23 after the pair had rowed over the phone. 'He appeared to be in a rage,' said Mr Pallister. 'She was grabbed by the throat by the defendant. He pulled her with a lot of force, making it hard for her to breathe. 'He then let go of her and she saw he was holding a hammer. 'He said ""I’m going to put this in your head"" and he began swinging the hammer towards her head. 'She managed to put her arm up to try and protect her face. 'She tried to close the door. 'He hit her leg with the hammer a number of times and she managed to slam the door.' The court heard Pearson banged at the door with the weapon demanding to be let in while Miss Crozier contacted the police. Mr . Pallister added: 'He said he had thought there was a chance they may . get back together but two weeks ago she told him she had met someone . else and that made him angry. Attack: Newcastle Crown Court heard the 45-year-old had aimed the clawed weapon at the mother's head, but she was able to put up her hand to fend off the blows . 'He wanted to know who the male was.' The court heard Pearson is 'regretful and repentant' and had 'lost all rational thought' when he carried out the attack. Sentencing, Judge Morris told Pearson: 'You could have killed her.' He was also ordered to stay away from Miss Crozier for the next five years under the terms of a restraining order. 'You are clearly someone who thinks they are entitled to control women,' said Judge Morris. 'What you did on this day was wholly unforgivable. 'Your former partner is entitled to see whoever she likes, whenever she likes. It is not up to you to decide what she does with her life.'","Geoffrey Pearson attacked Helen Crozier on the doorstep of her home .

"By . Lucy Thackray For Daily Mail Australia . Last week, a snappy Facebook post from a narky bride-to-be went viral, in which the woman writes a list telling her Facebook friends, in no uncertain terms, exactly 'why you're not invited to our wedding.' The list of reasons in the rude rant include 'if your (sic) only going to show up for food and alcohol and really have no reason other than that' and 'If at any point you have ever talked s**t about me... your (sic) definitely not invited.' But according to a Sydney-based wedding planner, bridezillas are not a rare breed - they are everywhere and they can be terrifying. ‘There are a lot of crying women in the wedding-planning process. It’s all just part of the job,’ said Fiona Deans-Dundas of Couture Wedding Planning. 'It can be a stressful time, sometimes they need to have a couple of tanties or a good cry to get all the anger out.' A Facebook post from a narky bride-to-be went viral last week, when the bride wrote a status explaining in very blunt terms to reasons why her friends might not have made the cut to attend her wedding . According to Sydney-based wedding planner Fiona Deans-Dundas, bridezillas are not a rare breed... They are everywhere and even the loveliest of woman can lose their minds during the wedding planning process . ‘Lots of brides do get quite frustrated and aggravated and can take it out on people quite badly, but I don’t think they even realise that they are doing it at the time.' This is where the wedding planner comes in, keeping the worst of the bridezilla behaviour at bay. ‘The smaller things can really get to the girls. You have those times when you feel like you’re looking at three almost-identical shades of pink for a little bit too long, or worrying because the chair sash doesn’t match the flower colour or something a little bit mad like that. 'You have requests and think to yourself, ‘flowers are natural things, you can’t order flowers in a specific colour shade!’ But, it’s our job to find solutions,’ explains the ever-patient Mrs Deans-Dundas. ‘You often hear horror stories from people that work in the wedding industry and it’s really scary. During the process, brides can lose it. I’m always careful when I choose clients or that could be my reality!' laughs Mrs Dundas-Deans. Mrs Deans-Dundas says that she is very wary of bridezillas and has learnt how to pick them out when she first meets with the future brides. ‘I try to weed out the bridezillas in the preliminary interviews. There are a lot of warning signs in that first meeting - if they’re already hard work at that stage, it’s going to be a long 18 months.’ Wedding planner Fiona Deans-Dundas, of Couture Weddings, on her own wedding day . But even the most down-to-earth, amiable women can crack under the pressure. ‘Each girl can get quite stressed before their wedding and can have their own bridezilla moments. When that happens you realise that the pressure is getting to them. ‘I choose to work with clients that I click with in the first meeting. I know that way we’ll have a great relationship. But everyone can get very stressed and stop thinking rationally,' said Mrs Dundas-Deans. The strain of the organising the nuptials means the wedding planner often bears the brunt of the client's stress. Mrs Dundas-Deans isn't surprised that the bride lost her cool over invitations, because she's seen it happen many a time. 'One of the most stressful parts of planning a wedding are the invitations. There’s so much information to need to get right, lots of details to have to get right and the couple have to rely on people to give them addresses in time. I find it’s at that point that cracks begin to show sometimes. 'If a bride is potentially going to get stressed, it’s also probably going to happen about two weeks before the wedding. Girls get very emotional and that’s when it’s the wedding planner’s job to be their best friend, to come up with solutions and let them know everything’s going to be okay! Wedding planner Fiona Deans-Dundas says that sometimes the pressure becomes too much for brides and that 'sometimes a few tanties or a good little cry is a good way to get the anger out' The seasoned wedding planner admits she had a bridezilla moment in the lead up to her big day. 'Even I remember crying on the week of my wedding! I cried over an issue with the ceremony booklets… But once the tantrum was done realised that no one cared about it except for me!’ Mrs Deans-Dundas says a wedding planner's job is to help the event run smoothly and juggle the expectations of the many people involved. ‘For the wedding planner, I think it’s just a matter of making everyone happy. The trickiest part of the job isn’t just the brides, there are a lot of expectations to manage. Parents and people close to them have a lot of opinions too and can become quite precious. It’s important to become the negotiator and friend to make everyone happy at the end of the day.' Despite the challenges, Mrs Deans-Dundas says 'it's a really fantastic job and I love my brides.' 'Being patient is a super important trait for a wedding planner. You have to be organised and a great listener, to listen to what people want. 'No matter what happens, you just have to always be upbeat and friendly and build great relationships with the brides.' 'The bride has a lot of expectations. How they'll feel on the day, how they'll feel in their dress, what their wedding's going to be like. We need to help them make it happen.'","Facebook status from snappy bride-to-be went viral worldwide last week .

"By . Emma Glanfield For Mailonline . Emma Kirsopp, 38, (pictured concealing her face outside South Tyneside Magistrates' Court) pleaded guilty to being drunk while in charge of her child . A drunken mother who was spotted swigging from a bottle of vodka while pushing a pram with her two-year-old son in has been spared jail. Emma Kirsopp, 38, was pushing the youngster in his buggy along a road in South Shields when a concerned member of the public contacted police to say the woman could barely walk. When officers arrived at the scene the mother - who could hardly talk or stand - was arrested and the toddler was placed under police protection. Kirsopp pleaded guilty to being drunk in a public place while in charge of a child - for the second time in a year – when she appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court yesterday. Handing her a 12-month community order, Yvonne Cracknell, chair of the court, told the mother: 'This is your final chance. Take it with both hands.' The court heard how Kirsopp needed to pay her bills but had no money because her partner had taken away her bank cards to prevent her from drinking on July 9. She walked into town to get some money from the bank but met a friend who gave her some cash, which she spent on a large bottle of vodka and proceeded to drink the street. Lee Poppett, prosecuting, said: 'At shortly before noon, police received reports of concern for a baby being pushed in a pushchair by a lady struggling to walk, who appeared intoxicated. 'When police arrived, they found Kirsopp in the street with her two-year-old son in a buggy. 'She was barely able to stand. She could hardly talk or walk. She was crying and said to police she was alcoholic. 'The child was taken into police protection and she was arrested.' He added: 'It's fair to say she gave a full account in interview. She was emotional in interview and was full of remorse.' David Forrester, defending, said Kirsopp - who is tackling her alcohol problems with the help of the probation service - had a 'difficult and traumatic history'. He said: 'She had been alcohol free for a number of months and lapsed on this occasion. 'She had no money and felt helpless.' South Tyneside Magistrates' Court (pictured) heard how alcoholic Kirsopp 'could barely stand or talk' as she drank from a large bottle of vodka while pushing her two-year-son along a road in South Shields on July 9 . The court heard that Kirsopp, of South Shields, had been given a four month jail term suspended for 18 months last August for driving with excess alcohol and being drunk in charge of a child. Magistrates agreed not to activate the suspended sentence - instead extending it for a further six months. The court was told that the youngster is still under Kirsopp's care at her home address.","Emma Kirsopp could 'barely stand' as she drank vodka while pushing pram .

"By . Stephanie Linning For Mailonline . Repeat offender: Paul Francis' previous convictions included a nine-year jail term for indecent assault and intercourse with a girl under 16 . A paedophile with a 30-year criminal record abused a ten-year-old girl he lured into his home after a housing association allowed him to live near a playground. Paul Francis, 62, was given a home next to a local park, nursery and youth group by a . housing association that failed to spot his background of child sex . crimes. He watched the young girl from his bedroom window in Yeovil, Somerset, as she played in the playground below. Francis used his window as a vantage point to take photos of the 10-year-old on the swings, before later inviting her back to his home. Posing as a singing teacher, Francis . approached the girl outside her school gates and handed her a . colourful invitation to join a singing group at his home. She . arrived accompanied by her best friend and Francis made them look at . adult porn before photographing them and asking them to take their . clothes off. On another occasion he grabbed the best friend’s hand before moving it . to his penis and telling her he would 'show her how to make a man . excited'. Francis also left notes for the 10-year-old on his front door, telling her she was beautiful and he wanted to kiss her. The abuse only stopped when the schoolgirl told a Police Community Support Officer visiting her school what had happened. Francis was today jailed for four years at Taunton Crown Court, Somerset, after he admitted two counts . of sexual assault on a child under 13 and one of attempting to cause a . child under 13 to engage in sexual behaviour. He also pleaded guilty . to causing a child to watch a sexual act, of causing or inciting child . prostitution and of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in . sexual activity. The court was read a list of . his previous convictions which included a nine-year jail term for . indecent assault and intercourse with a girl under 16. Francis’ most recent conviction was for indecent exposure in 2005. Mr Recorder Philip Mott, QC, said: 'This is a case where the activity . taken in isolation without the background of your history and the . documents found in your possession might have seen comparitively minor. 'But . they are more serious. They together describe what is not disputed, . that you are clearly dangerous and there is significant risk of serious . harm of future offences carried out by you.' The court heard Francis’ abuse began in March 2014 after Yarlington Housing Group, who manage 9,000 properties around Somerset region, moved him into supported housing. No background checks were run and he was placed just yards away from a local park, nursery and youth group. Sentenced: Francis was jailed at Taunton Crown Court, pictured, after he admitted two counts of sexual assault on a child under 13 and one of attempting to cause a child under 13 to engage in sexual behaviour . His bedroom window overlooked the child’s play area and he used the view to pick out the ten-year-old as a target. When schoolgirl arrived at his house on March 23, the meeting quickly turned sinister when he started to show them pornographic pictures. Malcolm Galloway, prosecuting, said: 'It is not disputed that this defendant has a serious and entrenched attraction to children. This was a clear attempt to attract, then groom, children. 'She visited his home the following day, where he showed the girls rude pictures and photo albums of them fully clothed. 'Francis took hold of the other girl’s hand and told her he would show her how to make a man excited before placing her hand on his willy. 'I have begun to love you in an ungrown-up like way which other grown-ups don’t like to know about' - Paul Francis . 'He tried to take the other girl’s hand but she refused, the girls left some time later.' The court heard Francis showed the girls photographs he had taken of them on the swings before making the girl pose for more pictures, telling her it would be okay if she took her clothes off. Although the girls refused the court was told evidence from his flat showed the pictures would have later been sold on the internet. On one occasion he told the ten year-old he had 'begun to love you in an ungrown-up like way which other grown-ups don’t like to know about'. When arrested, police discovered a disgusting diary documenting the day’s events and his vile plans for the future. Rebecca Bradbury, defending, said: 'He has always expressed he found relief at being arrested. 'At the time of the offences he was no longer under the Thames Valley Sex Offenders Programme which he describes as being ""marvellous"". 'He wants help. He has frightened himself by view of these offences and he knows he cannot drop his guard and has to keep himself in check.' Francis will serve up to four years in prison and be subject to an extended six years on licence. He was ordered to sign the sex offenders register and made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order for life. Detective Constable Andrew Tearle said he fears 'predatory' Paul Francis has committed more disgusting offences. After the case he said: 'Paul Francis acted in a predatory manner to target young girls with promises of music lessons and being in a band. 'In reality, he exploited their innocent dreams to build relationships with them and abuse them. 'I hope that in receiving a lengthy custodial sentence he recognises the seriousness of his actions. 'Francis targeted his victims with hand-drawn posters advertising singing lessons in Yeovil and when we searched his house we found posters dating back to time spent living in west Somerset. 'My fear is that he may have committed offences in that area and I would encourage anyone who has concerns about the individual to get in touch and discuss them with us.' A spokeswoman for Yarlington Housing Group today said: 'We can confirm that Mr Paul Francis was a tenant of Yarlington Housing Group, but as a result of action taken by Yarlington, he ended his tenancy in March 2014 following his arrest for a serious criminal offence. 'Where a housing applicant is a registered sex offender, we liaise closely with the Police and the Probation Services to ensure any potential risk to the community is adequately managed. 'At the time of his application, Mr Francis was not on the sex offenders register. 'We are aware that he has now been convicted of charges brought against him and our thoughts go out to the families who have been affected by his offences at this difficult time. 'Yarlington takes a robust approach to dealing with criminal offences and anti-social behaviour that occur within its properties, and aims to take swift action to protect our communities. 'In this respect, we work in close partnership with statutory and voluntary agencies, and when necessary the Police.'","Paul Francis, 62, spotted girl, 10, in the playground and took photos of her .

"By . Ollie Gillman For Mailonline . Tigers jumping through flames, horses rearing elegantly and elephants standing on their hind legs - animals have played a large role in Mexican circuses for generations. But not for much longer, with Mexico's government banning the use of animals in performances last month. Lawmakers in the Latin American country have given acts a year to adapt to the law, so the animal shows will go on for the time being - as these incredible pictures show. Flames: Circus animals have been banned in Mexico, but acts have a year to make the changes . These performers protested against the law, saying the animals, including elephants, are well looked after . The performers say they care for the animals, and that they were born and raised on the circus . A tiger dances as a matador waves a whip in the air. Animal rights activists say the animals are mistreated . Audience members are mesmerised by the different animals on show, but they will be banned next year . Armando Cedeno, president of the Mexican circus association, said animals would die if set free in the wild . These images, taken at a circus in Mexico City, show just how large a part animals play in Mexican performances. Tigers are seen jumping through fiery rings and dancing with matadors, all to the applause of the audience. Meanwhile elephants and horses are both seen rearing on their hind legs, as animals perform alongside Mexicans in a tradition that dates back more than 200 years. But animal rights activists say the creatures are mistreated, leading them to celebrate the incoming change in the law. However, performers dispute this, saying the creatures are born and raised in the circuses they perform in and do not know another way of life. Armando Cedeno, president of the Mexican circus association, said 50,000 circus employees could lose their jobs, and as many as 3,500 would be affected by the changes. He said: 'It is impossible to take these animals back to their natural habitat, because they would die.' The darker side of the circus: A young girl poses with an elephant backstage . Caged: A horse stands in a small cage in a darkened room. Activists have celebrated a change in Mexican law that will see animals banned from circuses from July 15, 2015 . Circus performers say the ban will leave up to 50,000 people in danger of losing their jobs . Circus performers took to the streets of Mexico City to protest against the law, holding public shows without animals to highlight what performances will look like this time next year. The animals are well fed, cleaned and cared for, the performers claim. Any circuses found to be flouting the ban could be fined up to $70,000 and animals will be seized. The ban is the latest in a wave of animal rights legislation passed in Latin American countries. Six Mexican states have already banned the use of animals in the circus, as do South American countries, Bolivia, Peru, Paraguay and Colombia. Bullfighting is still legal in most countries, but some campaigners have called for it to end in Mexico. Parts of Ecuador do not allow the final killing of the bull to take place in front of an audience.","Performers take to streets in protest as Mexico bans animals from circuses .

Fish's best friend: The dog dashes to a second fish in an attempt to bring it back to life . As the dog becomes more desperate in his attempts to revive one fish, it scrapes its nose along the ground, missing the shallow puddle of water entirely. The mobile phone video, shot in Thailand, then shows fish's best friend frantically dashing on to another of the large catches. The dog carries on splashing as its owner laughs more, but the fish still do not move. However, just as the dog starts to lose hope, one of the fish shows a flicker of life as it opens its mouth and flails slightly. By this time the golden retriever has already moved onto another fish and does not notice. A gentle nudge with its nose does not rouse the stranded fish, as a person watching starts laughing . Just after the dog gives up and moves on to the next fish, the second one wriggles slightly and opens its mouth but the caring hound does not notice . One user, Jack Fermon, said: 'That's why I hate people and love dogs...' Another, under the name Red Magnet, added: 'Dog tries to save fish while humans only take a video and post it on youtube. Sounds about right.' Cody Graham said: 'Dogs are so much kinder then people are.' It's not just in Thailand where dog and fish come face-to-face. This was the scene near Manchester yesterday when a dog surprised fishermen by emerging from a lake with a carp between its teeth. The labrador proudly emerged from the lake with the large fish folded between its chops, entertaining a gaggle of fishermen.","Golden retriever battles to bring fish to life by splashing them with water .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Astronomers have found a bizarre rapidly spinning star that appears to ‘vanish’ and transform every so often. Known as a pulsar, it is part of a binary system with another star one fifth the mass of the sun, and occasionally its radio beacon vanishes while the system brightens considerably. Scientists had been baffled by the odd behaviour, but now they think it might be caused by the pulsar sucking in material from its companion star and spitting it out again. Scroll down for video explanation . Astronomers have found a pulsar that seems to change its behaviour. In this artist's concept one model of pulsar J1023 is shown before (top) and after (bottom) its radio beacon (green) vanished. When the stream surges from its partner, an accretion disk forms and gamma-ray particle jets (magenta) obscure the beam . When a massive star collapses and explodes as a supernova, its crushed core may survive as a compact remnant called a neutron star or pulsar. This is an object squeezing more mass than the sun's into a sphere no larger than Washington, D.C. Young isolated neutron stars rotate tens of times each second and generate beams of radio, visible light, X-rays and gamma rays that astronomers observe as pulses whenever the beams sweep past Earth. Pulsars also generate powerful outflows, or 'winds,' of high-energy particles moving near the speed of light. The power for all this comes from the pulsar's rapidly spinning magnetic field and over time, as the pulsars wind down, these emissions fade. More than 30 years ago, astronomers discovered another type of pulsar revolving in 10 milliseconds or less, reaching incredible rotational speeds up to 43,000 revolutions per minute, which became known as millisecond pulsars. While young pulsars usually appear in isolation, more than half of millisecond pulsars occur in binary systems, which suggests an explanation for their rapid spin. The two-star system, known as AY Sextantis, is located about 4,400 light-years away in the constellation Sextans. Measurements were made by Nasa’s Earth-orbiting Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, which is used to observe emissions of gamma rays, the most powerful form of light. This particular observation was made more than a year ago in June 2013, but only now do astronomers think they have an explanation for what’s going on. Known as . PSR J1023+0038, the rapidly spinning neutron star is referred to as a . 1.7-millisecond pulsar, denoting the time it takes to rotate at an . incredible 43,000 revolutions per minute. The . other star - which is a more regular sun-like star by comparison - . completes an orbit of the pulsar in just 4.8 hours, which places them so . close together that the pulsar will gradually evaporate its companion. What is happening is that the pulsar is changing from a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) to a radio pulsar periodically as it does so. An LMXB is a binary star that is luminious in X-rays, while a radio pulsar is one that emits a radio beam. For some reason the pulsar seems to be switching between the two states. Astronomers now think that it is because the pulsar is sucking material from its companion star. As the companion star orbits it is continuously losing gas to the pulsar. However it seems to occasionally undergo surges, for reasons unknown, when it loses more material than normal to the pulsar. This forms a disk of material around the pulsar, which slowly falls closer to the pulsar up to an altitude of just 50 miles (80 kilometres) above it, where it becomes superheated. When this happens it obscures the emission of radio waves from the pulsar's poles. But the disk itself emits X-rays, so the pulsar switches from emitting beams of gamma and radio waves to beams of X-rays. The pulsar can be obscured for years while the transformation takes place, until it becomes an LMXB-like object and begins emitting X-rays. Eventually the disk dissipates and the pulsar goes back to just emitting noticeable radio waves. When a massive star collapses and explodes as a supernova, its crushed core may survive as a compact remnant called a neutron star or pulsar. This is an object squeezing more mass than the sun's into a sphere no larger than Washington, D.C. Pulsars rotate tens of times each second and generate beams . Dr Benjamin Stappers, an astrophysicist at the University of Manchester, who led the international effort to understand this striking transformation, explains to MailOnline that the pulsar changed from being like an LMXB just over a decade ago. It then became a radio pulsar for about six to seven years before last year, when it changed back into an LMXB-like object. ‘What we don't know is how long it will be in this phase for because we haven't seen a complete cycle,’ he explains. ‘We don't know when it will happen again nor whether it is periodic or even episodic. ‘So we are continuing to monitor the source at radio, optical, X-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths to try and catch the exact moment it changes again.’ In a press release Dr Stappers added: ‘It's almost as if someone flipped a switch, morphing the system from a lower-energy state to a higher-energy one. ‘The change appears to reflect an erratic interaction between the pulsar and its companion, one that allows us an opportunity to explore a rare transitional phase in the life of this binary.’ Anne Archibald, a postdoctoral . researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (Astron) in . Dwingeloo who discovered J1023 in 2007, added: 'Astronomers have long suspected . millisecond pulsars were spun up through the transfer and accumulation . of matter from their companion stars, so we often refer to them as . recycled pulsars.' The findings were published in the The Astrophysical Journal. The team reports that J1023 is the first example of a transient, compact, low-mass gamma-ray binary ever seen. The researchers anticipate that the system will serve as a unique laboratory for understanding how millisecond pulsars form and for studying the details of how accretion takes place on neutron stars. Nasa's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope was launched on 11 June 2008. It is situated in low Earth orbit and is used to perform gamma-ray astronomy observations with its main instrument, the Large Area Telescope, which can perform an all-sky surveys and is used to study pulsars like J1023 .","Astronomers led from University of Manchester studied a distant pulsar .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Archaeologists often put faces to names, but now a team has put a face to an ancient lion figurine that was carved 40,000 years ago. An ivory fragment discovered in a German cave has been revealed as the missing piece of the lion’s head and has been reunited with the intricately carved animal figure, just over 80 years since the Ice Age sculpture was found. The tiny fragment shows the lion was a three dimensional figure and not a relief, as experts had long thought. A rip roaring discovery: An ivory fragment discovered in a German cave (pictured left) has been revealed as the missing piece of an Ice Age lion figurine's head and has been reunited with the intricately carved animal figure (pictured right), just over 80 years after the 40,000-year-old sculpture was found . The Vogelherd Cave in Germany is considered to be one the world's most important archaeological sites of the Stone Age. It was located on a hill to offer a 180 degree view of the Lone valley below. From the vantage point our ancestors could watch for danger, spot prey and go hunting. With its three exits, it offered early humans shelter and refuge for 100,000 years. Residents of the cave left layers of treasures behind, including the carved ivory figurines. The woolly mammoth figure from the cave is said to be the oldest completely preserved figurative art in human history, at 35,000 to 40,000 years of age. It is thought it took around 300 hours to make. Archaeologists from the University of Tübingen, Germany, found the ancient fragment of mammoth ivory belonging to the Ice Age animal figurine, which is now on show at the university’s museum. It was discovered in the Vogelherd cave in south west Germany, where other works of art created 40,000 years ago were uncovered in 1931, including an ivory figuring of a woolly mammoth. ‘The figure depicts a lion,’ said Professor Nicholas Conard of Tübingen University’s Institute of Prehistory and Medieval Archaeology. ‘It is one of the most famous Ice Age works of art and until now, we thought it was a relief, unique among these finds dating to the dawn of figurative art.

Several dozen figurines and fragments of figurines have been found in the Vogelherd alone and researchers are piecing together thousands of mammoth ivory fragments.

"By . Charlie Eccleshare . Aaron Ramsey believes that Arsenal have their most settled side in years, and by doing their transfer business early are in a strong position to mount a serious title challenge this season. The Gunners finally ended their nine-year long trophy drought by winning the FA Cup in May, and Ramsey insists that will be the start of a new era for the North London club. The Welshman told the Evening Standard: 'This season the team are more settled going into the new campaign. We have had a few weeks together to get to know each other better and maybe that will help us when the season starts. On fire: Aaron Ramsey scores for Arsenal in Sunday's Community Shield clash against Manchester City . Pick that one out! Ramsey celebrates his goal and is hoping for another  prolific season for Arsenal . VIDEO Wenger hails 'complete' Arsenal performance . 'Alexis Sanchez had a great World Cup with Chile and they are all fantastic signings. The new boys bring some more quality to the team and they have settled in really well. 'Every season prior to last season, the talk was about how Arsenal had not won anything. We have finally put an end to that and we really want to kick on and be successful for many years to come. We want to keep this momentum going.' Ramsey, who scored in Sunday's 3-0 Community Shield win against Manchester City, was clear about Arsenal's aims for the forthcoming campaign: 'This season we want to challenge for the Premier League and the Champions League,' he said. New kid in town: Alexis Sanchez has  put in some exciting pre-season performances and impressed Ramsey . Mature beyond his years: Calum Chambers is another new arrival  and shone against City on Sunday . No more panic buys: In previous years Arsene Wenger has bought flops like Park Chu-young at the last minute . For Arsene Wenger's team to be able to compete at that level, Ramsey will need to recapture the scintillating form that saw him score 16 times for the Gunners last season. The 23-year-old had a summer off during the World Cup and is in confident mood. Reborn: Ramsey was abused by some Arsenal fans until a stellar season in 2013-14 where he scored 16 goals . 'Sometimes players are slow to get going after a World Cup but I have had a rest and am feeling good,' he said. 'Scoring the winner in the FA Cup final was a great way to end last season and watching the World Cup made me want to get back out there. 'There are still things for me to improve on and I am looking forward to doing that. Hopefully, I can hit the ground running, and so can the whole team.' Arsenal begin their Premier League campaign against Crystal Palace at Emirates Stadium on Saturday.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A souped-up version of the Curiosity rover has been unveiled with seven powerful instruments that could help unravel the mysteries of the red planet. Among the most exciting is Moxie - a machine that sucks in carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere and pumps out pure oxygen for rocket fuel, or for humans to someday breathe. The 2020 Mars rover will also have the capability to capture images of the red planet that Nasa scientists claim will ‘knock your socks off’, using an instrument known as MastCam. Scroll down for video . Nasa has announced a slew of new instruments on its planned 2020 Mars Rover, including 2 on its mast that provide better imaging capabilities . ‘It will be closer to having an experience of a human looking at Mars,’ said John Grunsfeld, an astronaut and associate administrator for the Nasa. ‘You’re going to feel like you’re on Mars and that’s going to be fantastic.’ MastCam will have an augmented 3.6:1 zoom feature capable of resolving images about one millimetre in size, in the near field and between three and four centimetres at 328ft (100 metre) distance. As well as MastCam, SuperCam will be able to provide imaging, chemical composition analysis and mineralogy. The 2020 Mars rover will also have the capability to capture images of the red planet that Nasa scientists claim will 'knock your socks off', using an instrument known as MastCam . Sherloc, a spectrometer, will provide fine-scale imaging and uses an ultraviolet (UV) laser to determine fine-scale mineralogy and detect organic compounds . Mastcam-Z: An advanced camera system with panoramic and stereoscopic imaging capability with the ability to zoom. The instrument will also establish the minerals found in Mars’ surface, and help with rover operations. SuperCam: An instrument that provides imaging, chemical composition analysis, and mineralogy. It will also be able to locate organic compounds in rocks, from a distance. Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL): An X-ray fluorescence spectrometer with a built-in high resolution imager than can determine the fine scale elemental composition of Martian surface materials. PIXL will make it possible to make detailed detection and analysis of chemical elements than ever before. Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC): A spectrometer that offers fine-scale imaging and uses an ultraviolet (UV) laser to determine detect minerals and compounds. The Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE): An exploration technology that will produce oxygen from carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere. Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyser (MEDA): A set of sensors that provide measurements of temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, relative humidity and dust size and shape. The Radar Imager for Mars' Subsurface Exploration (RIMFAX): A ground-penetrating radar that provides centimetre-scale resolution of the geologic structure of the subsurface. The instrument will also be able to detect the presence of organic compounds in rocks from a distance. Meanwhile, Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (Sherloc) will provide fine-scale imaging and uses an ultraviolet (UV) laser to determine fine-scale mineralogy and detect organic compounds. ‘The rocks on Mars tell a story,’ said Mr Grunsfeld. ‘They tell a story about the history of Mars, and the words of the story are written in minerals. And that’s what this rover is going to read.’ One of the key features is the fact that the rover’s 99lb (45kg) payload will be able to bring intact samples back to Earth, without it being crushed. Meda, a set of sensors, will provide measurements of temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, relative humidity and dust size and shape. ‘We are excited that Nasa’s Space Technology Program is partnered with Human Exploration and the Mars 2020 Rover Team to demonstrate our abilities to harvest the Mars atmosphere and convert its abundant carbon dioxide to pure oxygen,’ said James Reuther, deputy associate administrator for programs for the Space Technology Mission Directorate. ‘This technology demonstration will pave the way for more affordable human missions to Mars where oxygen is needed for life support and rocket propulsion.’ These instruments will be carried onboard the agency’s Mars 2020 mission, a roving laboratory based on the Curiosity rover. The ‘roving laboratory’ will be powered by a radioisotrope generator that gives the rover an operating life-span of at least a full Martian year. This equals 687 days on Earth. The space agency said it received 58 proposals in January for science and exploration technology instruments to fly on board the Mars 2020 mission. RIMFAX is a ground-penetrating radar that provides centimetre-scale resolution of the geologic structure of the subsurface . An X-ray fluorescence spectrometer with a built-in high resolution imager than can determine the fine scale elemental composition of Martian surface materials. PIXL will make it possible to make detailed detection and analysis of chemical elements than ever before . This was twice the average number of proposals submitted for instrument competitions in the recent past and an indicator of the extraordinary interest in exploration of the red planet. Nasa hopes the 2020 Mars rover will demonstrate technology for a human exploration of the planet and look for signs of life. For instance, the rover could make measurements and technology demonstrations to help designers of a human expedition understand any hazards posed by Martian dust. It could also demonstrate how to collect carbon dioxide, which could be a resource for making oxygen and rocket fuel. Nasa's next Mars rover (plans pictured) has been given a mission to find signs of past life and to collect and store rock from the the red planet that will one day be sent back to Earth. Mars 2020 will also demonstrate technology for a human exploration of the planet . SuperCam is an instrument that provides imaging, chemical composition analysis, and mineralogy. It will also be able to locate organic compounds in rocks, from a distance . It will use the same body of Nasa's Curiosity Rover, which is currently searching for life on Mars, and beginning the journey to its final destination. The new rover will also use the same landing system as Curiosity, which was a ground-breaking chassis and 'sky crane' to arrive on Mars in one piece. As a result, Mars 2020 is estimated to cost $1.5 billion - one billion less than its predecessor Curiosity. The new design, which will collect rock samples, marks the next major step in fulfilling President Obama's challenge of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s. John Grunsfeld, Nasa's associate administrator for science in Washington, said: 'Crafting the science and exploration goals is a crucial milestone in preparing for our next major Mars mission.' In April, head of the U.S. space programme Charles Bolden, said: 'If this species is to survive indefinitely we need to become a multi-planet species, we need to go to Mars, and Mars is a stepping stone to other solar systems.' Mr Bolden revealed plans for the series of 'stepping stones' to the red planet, which included 'lassoing' an asteroid. It also included growing plants in space, and using 3D printers for onboard repairs. The next generation rover (illustrated) will carry on exploring the Red Planet, with upgraded hardware and instruments to examine Mars' rocks. The mission marks the next major step in fulfilling President Obama's challenge of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s . The next generation rover will carry on exploring the Red Planet, with upgraded hardware and instruments to examine Mars' rocks. The rover will assess the potential of the environment for humans to live in one day and search for signs of Martian life. It will identify and collect a collection of rock and soil samples, which it will be able to send back to Earth intact, unlike the powdered samples collected by the current rover. Charles Elachi, director of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has previously said that collecting a rock sample and bringing it back to Earth is Nasa's top priority. Scientists are particularly interested in the samples so they can understand the hazards posed by Martian dust and demonstrate how oxygen can be created - details important to consider for human missions to Mars and the future colonisation of the planet. The rover marks the next major step in fulfilling President Obama's challenge of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s. The 2020 mission aims to build on the accomplishments of Curiosity and other Mars missions. The Spirit and Opportunity rovers, along with several orbiters, found evidence Mars has a watery history. Curiosity has also confirmed that past environmental conditions on Mars could have supported living microbes. According to the Science Definition Team, looking for signs of past life is the next logical step. The rover will use its instruments for visual, mineralogical and chemical analysis down to microscopic scale to understand the environment around its landing site. It will also identify biosignatures or features in the rocks and soil that could have been formed biologically. Jack Mustard, chairman of the Science . Definition Team and a professor of geological sciences at Brown . University in Providence, said: 'The Mars 2020 mission concept does not presume that life ever existed on Mars.' 'However, given the recent Curiosity findings, past Martian life seems possible and we should begin the difficult endeavor of seeking the signs of life. 'No matter what we learn, we would make significant progress in understanding the circumstances of early life existing on Earth and the possibilities of extraterrestrial life.' There are plans for the next rover to collect and package as many as 31 samples of rock cores and soil with the intention of a later mission picking them up bringing them back to Earth for more definitive analysis in laboratories. In a bid to save time and money, the Mars 2020 rover will share the body of Nasa's Curiosity Rover (model pictured) which is currently searching for life on Mars. The new rover will use the same landing system as Curiosity, which used a ground-breaking chassis and 'sky crane' to arrive on Mars in one piece .","New Curiosity rover set will feature seven powerful instruments .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Craig Gardner laughs off the suggestion he signed for West Bromwich Albion this summer simply to score a hat-trick of West Midlands clubs, having started at Aston Villa before switching to Birmingham City. But he admits his enthusiasm had waned during a three-year spell at Sunderland and believes returning to the hotbed of tribalism he used to call home will trigger a purple period in his career. ‘It’s not a puzzle that I’m trying to complete, it’s a career I want to fulfil,’ explains Gardner, born in Solihull. ‘People say Sunderland is only three hours away but it’s that you’re not seeing your friends every day, you’re not seeing your family every day. If you’re happy at home you’re happy at your job. Keeping up appearances: Craig Gardner signed for West Bromwich Albion at the beginning of the summer . Having a laugh! The midfielder refuted suggestions he wanted to complete a Midlands hat-trick . ‘I’m a Brummie through and through as it’s where I feel I’ve played my best football. I had a good career at Villa, a really good career at Birmingham, and I want to better that now at West Brom.’ Gardner, a Birmingham fan as a boy, is well versed in the tangled rivalries having been brought up in a house of six brothers whose allegiances are split. ‘There’s always fights going on,’ he says. His brother Gary, 22, plays for and supports Villa, penning a new contract at the club this summer despite suffering lengthy injuries the past couple of seasons. Last week he played a prank on his older sibling by buying Craig’s two daughters claret-and-blue kits with ‘Niece’ on the backs and posting a photograph on Twitter. ‘He got me,’ says Gardner, 27, with a smile. ‘But as I told him, what goes around comes around. There’s a bit more toilet roll in the house now!’ The episode gives an illustration of what Gardner had missed during his time at Sunderland; regular interaction with his large family and snappy mickey-taking. ‘Banter,’ he says. Gardner left Villa in January 2010 when opportunities became limited, with manager Martin O’Neill able to pick from a number of expensive signings. Now it is West Brom paying eight-figure fees, as they did for Nigerian centre forward Brown Ideye, and capturing the likes of Joleon Lescott, who Villa had wanted. ‘We’re going out spending £10million on a striker and bringing in Joleon and other players who Premier League teams are after,’ says Gardner. ‘They’re choosing us. I think West Brom are on the up. ‘When I was there Villa had Gareth Barry, Ashley Young, John Carew, Stiliyan Petrov, James Milner, Stewart Downing. We had some top-class players and were fighting for the top six.’ The purse strings have tightened since then and brother Gary, an academy graduate with England Under 21 caps, may have a leading role to perform this season. ‘I ask him after all the training sessions how he’s fitting in, how he’s done, how’s Roy Keane,’ says Gardner. ‘I’m his biggest fan. It shows how good he is when he’s been injured for two years and they give him another contract. This season is a big one for him.’ It is a campaign that Gardner wants to seize too. He was limited to substitute appearances as Sunderland pulled off a ‘miracle’ survival under Gus Poyet. He did not start a league game after December 4. A move to the Hawthorns ‘really nearly happened in January’. Looking ahead: Gardner, formerly of Aston Villa and Birmingham, wants to seize this season at West Brom . His first game in a West Brom shirt will be the visit of Sunderland on Saturday. ‘Even though I wasn’t getting the game time it was hard to dislike Gus because he’s a good manager,’ Gardner says. His boss now is Alan Irvine, a head coach whose appointment initially shocked fans. But his credibility is increasing as a growing contingent of players enthuse over his methods. ‘Before you judge him you need to watch his training sessions, you need to be in the dressing room, you need to really know him,’ says Gardner. ‘On the training pitch we get well-set drills that relate to proper games. He doesn’t just talk for the sake of it. I’ve worked under a lot of people but coach-wise Alan is probably the best. He’s very, very good.’ Gardner thinks striker Ideye, who scored 33 goals in 74 games at Dynamo Kiev, can cause a surprise too. ‘He runs the channels, gets hold of the ball, can turn and he knows where the net is. Not many people know what he’s like and they might give him that extra yard. That’s all it needs nowadays.’ Happy days! Gardner moved back to the Midlands on a free after a spell up in Sunderland . On a personal level Gardner, a sweet striker of the ball from distance, has set himself a target of 10 goals from midfield to ensure last season’s 17th-place finish was truly a ‘blip’ for the Baggies. ‘I can sit here and say we want to finish in the top eight. But is it realistic, is it unrealistic? We want to finish as high up the table as we can. I think we’re going to have a really good season.’ The best moment in his career was winning the League Cup with Birmingham in 2011, only for the worst moment to follow three months later with relegation to the Championship. He scored 10 goals that campaign. ‘Looking back now you’d rather have stayed up than won the cup,’ he admits, adding that wherever he went in the second city during that time supporters would encourage and cajole. ‘Even close friends and family said, “Come on, any chance of winning today?” I’m back in that environment. It’s where I want to be. You’re getting judged by the people who love you. It’s a good buzz.’","Ex-Aston Villa and Birmingham man will be in midfield at the Hawthorns .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Time and again ancient ‘bog bodies’, and their remarkably well-preserved features dating back thousands of years, have left scientists speechless. These eerie cadavers are naturally mummified within a peat bog that preserves intricate details, such forehead creases and even laughter lines. Now, the incredible properties of peat are being used by the beauty industry to create skincare products that claim to promote youth and cure skin damage. Scroll down for video . Bill Kenny from Croghan Hill was inspired to launch the the peat-based Ógra skincare range after seeing the well-preserved Iron Age body of 'Old Croghan Man' (pictured) found in a bog in 2003 . One such company is Tullamore-based Ógra who is using peat to create a range of luxury skincare products, according to a report by Audrey McGlinchy in Narratively. The Irish group has made use of local peat, which is the material formed when plant remains partially decompose. This particular peat in County Offaly has one of the highest concentration of antioxidants in the world. Bogs, which are particularly common in Ireland, contain this peat which as the bog grows, gets pushed deeper beneath the surface. Bogs, which are particularly common in Ireland, contain peat which as the bog grows, gets pushed deeper beneath the surface . Inspired by peat's protective powers, Mr Kenny started Ógra - the Irish word for ‘youth’. The company now sells peat-based skincare products such as the Peat Face and Body Mask for £40 ($66) Away from oxygen, the bacteria that break down matter can’t survive, which means the deeper you dig in a bog, the greater peat’s youthful power. Bill Kenny, founder of Ógra, lives just few miles away from a 14-acre bog near Croghan Hill in which the Iron Age ‘Old Croghan Man’ was discovered in 2003. Promotes youthfulness – According to Ogra, the skincare company, peat contains strong antioxidants that can combat free radical damage. This free radical damage is generally recognised as the main cause of premature ageing. Peat contains trace elements including zinc, copper, iron, selenium as well as partially rotted plants such as bog whortleberry. It is also alleged to promote an increase in collagen production which helps to increase cell regeneration and slow down the ageing process. Astringency – It claims to tighten the pores which gives the skin a smoother look. Detoxifier – The company claim that peat stimulates the lymphatic system and is therefore a very effective detoxifier. Peat removes dead skin cells, toxins and other impurities from your skin. PH balance - The natural abundance of essential oils and fatty acids penetrate into the skin and are thought to to re-establish the skin’s natural PH balance . Source: Ogra Skincare . ‘I remember the police superintendent phoning me up to tell me they’d found a body in the peat,’ the former construction worker told MailOnline. ‘I thought maybe it was a murder victim, but when I spoke to the superintendent that evening he told me the man was there for thousands of years. ‘He was so well-preserved, they could tell you what he ate the day he died, and by the pollen in his nostrils, what time of year he died.’ Inspired by these protective powers, Mr Kenny started Ógra - the Irish word for ‘youth’. The company now sells peat-based skincare products such as the Peat Face and Body Mask for £40 ($66). Last year, Ógra Skincare sent a batch of peat to Glasgow University to be dated and they found that Mr Kenny’s bog is more than 9,000 years old. The peat, they discovered, contained 98 to 99 per cent organic materials, including high levels of antioxidants and antiseptics. The main antioxidant is trolox, the water-soluble equivalent of vitamin E. The product also contains magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, copper, iron and zinc. Recalling his earliest memory of peat, Mr Kenny is still amazed by it ‘magical properties’. ‘When I was seven, my hand was badly burnt by a pot of water,’ he told MailOnline. ‘I got up and all the skin on my hand fell, it was red raw, just like a piece of liver. ‘My mother put me on a bicycle and took me to a peat bog that we own just a mile away. She mixed up the peat and she put my hand straight down into it. ‘The only thing I can remember about that, is that once I entered my hand into the peat there was no more pain… I thought, there must be something fabulous in peat.’ Bill Kenny, founder of Ógra, lives just few miles away from a fourteen-acre bog near Croghan Hill in which the Iron Age ‘Old Croghan Man’ was discovered .","Bill Kenny from Croghan Hill launched the peat Ógra skincare range .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Archbishop Desmond Tuttu: He claims Blair and Bush lied about weapons of mass destruction . Archbishop Desmond Tutu has demanded that Tony Blair be tried in The Hague over the invasion of Iraq. The Nobel Peace Prize winner accused the former Prime Minister of lying about Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction and said that the 2003 war had left the world  more destabilised and divided than ‘any other conflict in history’. He said Mr Blair should be subjected to a trial at the International Criminal Court, along with former US president George W. Bush. The archbishop claimed that the US and UK-led military operation to oust Saddam  created the backdrop for the civil war in Syria and a possible wider Middle East conflict involving Iran. He said: ‘The then leaders of the United States and Great Britain fabricated the grounds to behave like playground bullies and drive us further apart. ‘They have driven us to the edge of a precipice where we now stand – with the spectre  of Syria and Iran before us. 'The question is not whether Saddam Hussein was good or bad or how many people he massacred, the point is that Mr Bush and Mr Blair should not have allowed themselves to stoop to his immoral level.’ Calling for the pair to face justice in The Hague, he said different standards appeared to be set for prosecuting African leaders, and that the death toll during and after the Iraq conflict was sufficient evidence for them to face action. Accused: George Bush and Tony Blair who said today that Archbishop Tutu was wrong about the Iraq war . ‘On these grounds alone, in  a . consistent world, those responsible should be treading the same path as . some of their African and Asian peers who have been made to answer for . their actions in The Hague,’  he said. Archbishop Tutu, a long-time critic . of the Iraq war, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for speaking out . against apartheid in his native South Africa. Last week he pulled out of a South African conference on leadership because Mr Blair was attending. In response to the archbishop’s . remarks, Mr Blair said that it was right to get rid of Saddam because of . the human rights abuses he perpetrated, and he argued that Iraq was now . a better place. He said: ‘I have a great respect for . Archbishop Tutu’s fight against apartheid – where we were on the same . side of the argument – but to repeat the old canard that we lied about . the intelligence is completely wrong, as every single independent . analysis of the evidence has shown. Image of despair: Iraqis outside a morgue mourn the family victims of a bomb attack in Baghdad which killed 47 people . ‘And to say the fact that Saddam . massacred hundreds of thousands of his citizens is irrelevant to the . morality of removing him is bizarre.’ He added: ‘I would also point out . that despite the problems, Iraq today has an economy three times or more . in size with child mortality rate cut by a third of what it was. And . with investment hugely increased in places such as Basra.’ Yesterday, former Lib Dem leader Menzies Campbell declined to back Archbishop Tutu’s call for a Hague trial. He said: ‘When any question of crime . is discussed in any jurisdiction, you have to ask yourself whether an . act was committed and whether that act was committed with criminal . intent. 'Although I believe that George W Bush and Tony Blair were wrong ...  I don’t believe they did so with any malign intention.’","Nobel Peace Prize winner accuses Tony Blair and George W.

"By . Brendan Carlin . Whitehall's top mandarin has been forced to step in to defuse an extraordinary Cabinet feud over wind farms, it was claimed last night. Liberal Democrat sources say that Sir Jeremy Heywood was called in after a series of  blazing rows between Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey and Tory Environment Secretary Owen Paterson over Mr Davey’s controversial ‘green’ technology. Sources close to the Lib Dem Minister accused Mr Paterson of ‘lying’ over claims that Mr Davey had blocked publication of a report showing that on-shore wind farms can harm rural areas. It is claimed Whitehall's top mandarin Jeremy Heywood had to step in to defuse a cabinet row over wind farms. Last night, Mr Paterson’s office angrily denied that allegation and insisted that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy had never been called in to keep the peace between the pair. But Lib Dem sources accuse Mr Paterson of repeatedly ‘parking his tanks on our lawn’ by interfering in Mr Davey’s ‘green energy’ agenda. They say Mr Paterson and other Tory ‘climate-change deniers’ are jeopardising billions of pounds’ worth of private investment for renewable energy by casting doubt on the need for on-shore turbines. Mr Davey was apparently so outraged that he took the  unusual step of calling on Sir Jeremy to resolve the turf war and to remind Mr Paterson that climate policy was his remit. A source said: ‘Ed called in the Cabinet Office to get Paterson off his back and sort who was in charge of what. ‘Paterson was told that despite his environmental brief, tackling global warming was specifically our bag and not his.’ Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey, left, and Tory Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, right, are said to have had a series of 'blazing rows' over the controversial 'green' technology . However, the conflict escalated last month over claims that Mr Davey was suppressing an official report on the potential damage to the countryside from huge wind farms. Mr Paterson, who has previously said turbines are often regarded as a ‘complete scam’, was believed to be livid at the move and ‘determined’ to publish the report regardless. Sources in the Environment Secretary’s department also accused their Liberal Democrat colleague of being more concerned about ideology than hard scientific evidence. Last night, Mr Davey’s department rejected that claim, and insisted he had not even seen the wind farm report, which has still not been finished. Lib Dems blamed Mr Paterson for the ‘completely wrong’ allegations over the energy dossier. One said: ‘It’s pretty clear they were Owen’s views, whether they came directly or indirectly from him. It’s all part of an anti-wind farm crusade.’ In a speech to his party’s conference last week, Mr Davey ridiculed Mr Paterson – who is overseeing the controversial badger-culling programme – as he boasted that Lib Dems had seen off Tory plans to row back on environmental measures. He said: ‘Owen Paterson would cull wind turbines faster than he can cull badgers. But we have prevented the Stone Age wing of the Conservative Party from destroying our leading renewables industry.’ However, David Cameron  also cast doubt on the need  for more on-shore turbines  last month. Aides to Mr Paterson last night dismissed Lib Dem claims  that Sir Jeremy was called  in to settle the dispute as  ‘completely untrue’.","Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey and Tory Environment Secretary Owen Paterson locked in a turf war say sources .

"By . Rob Cooper . Russell Brand has claimed that Philip Seymour Hoffman is a 'victim' and his death is a consequence of 'extremely stupid drug laws'. The controversial star, who is a recovering heroin and alcohol addict, argued that the law turns addicts into criminals. Oscar-winner Mr Seymour Hoffman, 46, was found dead in his rented apartment in Greenwich Village, New York, last Sunday. Death: Russell Brand (left) said Philip Seymour Hoffman's death was a result of 'extremely stupid drug laws' He died from an overdose and police found 70 bags of heroin in the property surrounding his body. In an 800-word essay published in The Guardian, Mr Brand said that most addicts end up dying alone - and he added that the circumstances of the actor's death were 'inescapably bleak'. In the piece headlined 'Philip Seymour Hoffman is another victim of extremely stupid drug laws', he said that anti-drug laws add to the stigma surrounding addiction. The 38-year-old has repeatedly called for anti-drug laws to be relaxed - and his reaction to the tragedy in New York does not come as a surprise. Oscar winner: Philip Seymour Hoffman (left), who appeared in more than 50 movies, is seen here on the opening night of the Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman in March 2012 . Award winner: Philip Seymour Hoffman in a scene from the film Capote. He won an Oscar for his performance in 2005 . He has previously said he has been sober and not taken drugs for ten years - but thinks about heroin every day. In the article, he wrote: 'Addiction is a mental illness around which there is a great deal of confusion, which is hugely exacerbated by the laws that criminalise drug addicts. 'If drugs are illegal people who use drugs are criminals. We have set our moral compass on this erroneous premise, and we have strayed so far off course that the landscape we now inhabit provides us with no solutions and greatly increases the problem.' He added that it was unavoidable that people would use drugs - and banning them makes no difference. He argued that prohibition creates an unregulated system that leaves people exposed to a drugs empire controlled by criminals. Mr Brand questioned whether Philip Seymour Hoffman would have died if it were not for the stigma attached to taking illegal substances. He wrote: 'Would Hoffman have died if this disease were not so enmeshed in stigma? If we weren't invited to believe that people who suffer from addiction deserve to suffer?' When Mr Seymour Hoffman was found dead he was living in a rented apartment after becoming estranged from Mimi O'Donnell, his partner of 14 years. Last night Miss O'Donnell was visibly distraught as she attended a wake for the star on the Upper East Side of Manhattan accompanied by the couple's three children and their A-list friends. Miss O'Donnell arrived holding her sleeping daughter, Willa, 5, just before 5pm. The actor's mother, Marilyn O'Connor, entered the funeral home soon after and Hoffman's former co-stars Amy Adams, Cate Blanchett, Michelle Williams and Joaquin Phoenix were also in attendance. Mr Seymour Hoffman, who starred in more than 50 movies, is best known for his roles in Boogie Nights and the Big Lebowski. He won an Oscar in 2005 for his performance playing Truman Capote in the film Capote. It was revealed last year that the actor had sought treatment for drug addiction.","Mr Brand said the actor's death was a result of 'extremely stupid drug laws'

The cameras will capture every facial twitch between Jimmy Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja, but the Indian cannot afford to lose focus. He has fallen three times to Anderson in his 11 Tests. Anderson trapped him lbw on his debut at Nagpur in 2012 and has taken his wicket twice in this series. Ready to go: Jimmy Anderson is all smiles as he prepares for the fourth Test at Old Trafford . VIDEO Dhoni backs Jadeja ahead of fourth Test . Bowlers’ Manchester misery . Anderson will be looking to put a mediocre record on his home ground behind him. His 12 wickets in four Tests at Old Trafford have cost a middling 35 apiece. Last year against Australia he returned first-innings figures of none for 116 — the worst of his 97-Test career. Stuart Broad has taken two wickets at 108 each in his two Manchester Tests. Grounds to improve: Stuart Broad does not have a great record at Old Trafford . This will be only the third Test staged at Old Trafford since 2008, but England have a proud record here. Since losing to Australia in 1997, they have lost only one of 12 Tests in Manchester — against Pakistan in 2001, a Test famous for umpire David Shepherd missing a string of wicket-taking no-balls from Saqlain Mushtaq. Forget Anderson... watch out for Root . Aside from Anderson and Jadeja, the two players most likely to exchange a few unpleasantries are probably Joe Root and Virat Kohli. It went scarcely remarked upon on the last afternoon at Lord’s that Kohli celebrated in Root’s face after Matt Prior was caught at deep midwicket. And when Root himself hooked to deep backward square, Kohli made a point of posturing provocatively in his direction while the rest of the Indian team celebrated in a huddle. In the firing line: Joe Root and Virat Kohli could renew hostilities at Old Trafford . India have played eight Tests at Old Trafford and are yet to register a victory — losing three and drawing five. Their most recent game here was as far back as 1990, when the 17-year-old Sachin Tendulkar made an unbeaten century on the final day to salvage a draw. Little master: Sachin Tendulkar scored a century for India at Old Trafford in 1990 . Does Cook need a fielder down at Third Man? Is it about time England plugged third man from the start of India’s innings? Statistics show that Anderson in particular has suffered for Alastair Cook’s reluctance to post a fielder for the steer through the slip cordon. Of the 384 runs he conceded in the first three Tests, 126 came through third man. By contrast, Indian opening bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar has leaked only 67 runs to the same region, having given up 341 in total.","Jimmy Anderson has a mediocre record at his home ground .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Master plan: Ed Miliband said his party would tackle unequal pay in Britain as people on the minimum wage are worse off . Ed Miliband today declared he was bringing socialism back to Britain as he unveiled a raft of left-wing policies. The Labour leader promised to increase wages for the lowest paid, force schools to stay open for longer and monitor how many women appear on TV. Taking part in an open-air Q&A session in Brighton,Mr Miliband was asked when he would 'bring back socialism'. The son of Marxist think Ralph Miliband replied: 'That's what we are doing, sir. 'It is about fighting the battle for economic equality, for social equality and for gender equality too. 'That is a battle that is not yet won in our country.' He warned that people on the minimum wage are more than £860-a-year worse off because of the rising cost of living. The Labour leader unveiled plans to dramatically increase the guaranteed rate of pay to reverse the impact of inflation in the last three years. Mr Miliband hit out at global banks who make huge profits but claim they cannot afford to pay their cleaners 'a bit more'. The Labour party conference gets under way in Brighton this weekend, with a heavy emphasis on tackling the cost of living. But Mr Miliband faces tough questions about how the raft of policies would be paid for, with spending cuts to continue for several years after the 2015 election. He has pledged to reverse cuts to housing benefit, dubbed the bedroom tax, at a cost of £470milion, and claims it could be funded by closing loopholes used by hedge funds and the super-rich. Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman today unveiled plans for 'clear and consistent monitoring of older women in the broadcasting industry' But in a blow to Mr Miliband's claim to be helping people feeling the pinch, a new poll shows most people still blame Labour. The YouGov survey found 30 per cent . said Labour was to to blame for the fall in living standards over the . last few years, compared with 16 per cent who blame the Conservatives . alone and 9 per cent who blame the coalition. All parties together are blamed by 19 per cent while just one per cent said it was the fault of the Lib Dems. Family pose: Ed Miliband and his wife Justine take their children Daniel (right) and Sam (left) for a walk along Brighton beach on the eve of the Labour Party annual conference . Q&A: Ed Miliband's wife Justine (in red coat, below right) spoke in Brighton ahead of the Labour Party annual conference . The . Labour leader is also under pressure following revelations in the . memoir of former spin doctor Damian McBride suggesting Mr Miliband sent . potentially damaging emails to a party official plotting to smear . opponents. The memoir suggests Mr Miliband might ‘have problems’ if his exchanges with Labour insider Derek Draper are revealed. The tell-all autobiography, serialised in the Mail, has sent shockwaves through the party ahead of its conference in Brighton. Dressed . down in jeans and a grey jumper, Mr Miliband made no mention of the . claims as he appeared in Brighton with wife Justine to take questions . from the public and announce plans to increase the minimum wage. Alan . Buckle, deputy chairman of KPMG international, has been asked to . examine how to strengthen the minimum wage so it catches up with where . it was in 2010. Potentially damaging: Damian McBride, pictured right with Kate Garraway, says Miliband might have problems if his emails to Derek Draper (left) get out . Labour . claims the £6.19 rate for adults is now 45p lower than if it had kept . pace with the rate of inflation. If increased to restore its value, . someone working 37 hours-a-week would by £865 better off, before tax. This year the rate for adults is due to rise by two per cent, but the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) stands at 2.7 per cent. Mr Miliband told activists and members of the public during his Q&A session: ‘This next election is going to come down to the oldest questions in politics: Whose side are you on and who will you fight for? Confident: Miliband said he would 'make work pay' for British people . ‘The National Minimum Wage is now paying people £20 less per week after inflation than it did when David Cameron came to office. That’s just wrong. ‘When you see that happening and when you think about one of the big banks, do we really think they cannot afford to pay their cleaners a bit more? ‘I want to send a very clear signal . today. It’s wrong that millions of people in our country are going out . to work unable to afford to bring up their families. ‘We will strengthen the National Minimum Wage. We will make work pay for the workers of Britain.’ Under the Labour plan experts will examine whether there could be different levels of minimum wage in different sectors, to ensure that pay rises do not mean workers get their hours cut instead. With a run of strong economic indicators and Chancellor George Osborne boasting the economics has ’turned a corner’, all parties are under pressure to show ordinary people will start to see an improvement in their own incomes. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable has announced a similar review of the minimum wage. He has asked the Low Pay Commission to restore its value, which he calculates has fallen in real terms by 10-12 per cent since the crash of 2008. He said: ’We cannot go on for ever in a low pay and low productivity world in which all we can say to workers is “you have got to take a wage cut to keep your job”.’ The government’s measures to combat low pay will also involve steps to tackle theabuses of zero-hours contracts.","Labour leader appears with wife Justine for open-air Q&A session .

"By . Nasser Hussain . Sledging is not exactly new and it amazes me that some people have suddenly taken exception to Jimmy Anderson saying a few words. Where were they when Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer played? We don’t want our players to be robots. We expect a lot of them and we want to see that playing for England matters. International cricket is serious and I would rather see players displaying emotion than going into their shells. I want to see Anderson taking wickets and going past Sir Ian Botham’s record as England’s leading wicket-taker and it could well be that the way he acts and what he says on the field is what makes him the fantastic bowler he is. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Coral Daily cricket: James Anderson 2/1 to be top England bowler' Getting stuck in: James Anderson, right, and India's Ajinkya Rahane, center, exchange words . VIDEO England's Anderson cleared for fourth Test against India . Sometimes when a bowler starts chirping it can be a sign they are losing the battle but that is not the case with Jimmy. It is very much part of his game. What I would say is that there is a line that cannot be crossed and Anderson does come close to crossing it at times. So if I were England captain I would tell him today to be careful because he will now be a marked man. Be streetwise. Anderson must avoid incidents like exchanging words with Ajinkya Rahane as the players left the field on the fourth evening at the Ageas Bowl because he is on his last chance and England must ensure that he does not risk a ban again. The master: Shane Warne was well known for having a few words on the pitch . Respect: Steve Waugh and Nasser Hussain shake hands . The middle of a Test can be a hostile, lonely place and as a batsman it is you and your mate against 11 and if you could make an opposing batsman feel less comfortable out there with a word or two then that is legitimate to me. Believe me, there are some who would rather get back to the dressing room than fight it out and it is those a side will target, not someone like Brian Lara who would be woken up and motivated when anybody said something to him. Steve Waugh would call sledging ‘mental disintegration’ and if Warne would have a word with, say, the non-striker as he walked past him that was all part of the game as far as I was concerned. India have had some feisty characters over the years, certainly since Sourav Ganguly’s day, and it strikes me that MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja are two of their players who you would not target for sledging. They are street-fighters. Yet Anderson is a product of the last 20 years and he would have grown up watching the great Australian sides, and others, sledging and not being punished for it. Why should he be now? If the International Cricket Council want to change that and crack down on sledging then let them make it crystal clear and outline exactly what they do not approve of in their code of conduct. Otherwise, Anderson should carry on. I have said that if physical contact is involved, that is different and we will never know now what happened between Anderson and Jadeja in the Trent Bridge pavilion. But it was always going to be one man’s word against another, with both sides backing their man, so it should never have got to the stage where the referee was bypassed and lawyers and a judge were involved. The ICC were right to back up the verdict yesterday and now we should all move on.","Jimmy Anderson cleared by ICC for any wrong doing after incident with Ravindra Jadeja .

"By . John Preston . THE LONG RIDE HOME by Rupert Isaacson (Penguin £7.99) Horse sense: Autistic Rowan was stimulated in the saddle . Desperate people often do desperate things and in 2004 Rupert Isaacson did something very desperate indeed. In an attempt to ‘cure’ his six year-old son Rowan of autism, he took him to a shaman called Ghoste in Mongolia. As Isaacson described in his earlier book, The Horse Boy, the shaman spent three days drawing a strange mucus-like liquid out of Rowan’s head with his fingers — his parents also had to be whipped and to have their private parts anointed with ‘sacred vodka’. Afterwards, Ghoste promised that Rowan would gradually become less and less autistic until he reached the age of nine — when his autism would disappear completely. But there was one condition attached to all this. Over the next three years, Isaacson and his wife, Karin, had to take Rowan on other ‘healing journeys’ to shamen or faith healers. The healers could be anywhere in the world, Ghoste told them, but if they didn’t go to see them then his original magic wouldn’t work. The Long Ride Home is Isaacson’s account of what happened next. Ghoste’s ministrations — whatever they consisted of — seemed to have a dramatic effect on Rowan. He soon stopped having violent tantrums, he was no longer incontinent and he could even hold conversations — something he had never done before. Fearful that he might start backsliding unless they took him to another healer, they went to see the Bushmen of the Kalahari. Isaacson had previously helped the Bushmen in a land dispute with the Namibian government and one of their healers — a man with the seemingly unpronounceable name of Kunta — tells him that Rowan’s autism is the result of a curse laid on him by disgruntled government employees: ‘They threw a bone at you which missed and hit your son instead.’ Part of the Bushmen’s healing process consists of throwing the bone back from where it came. Over the next two years, Isaacson takes Rowan to Australia to see an Aborigine called Howard and to New Mexico to see a Native American healer called Blue Horse. Everyone they visit behaves as if curing autism is a complete doddle — ‘I’ve worked with some young men with autism before,’ Howard tells them. ‘Shouldn’t be too much trouble.’ Just like Ghoste in Mongolia, Howard starts drawing ‘slightly bloody mucus’ out of Rowan’s head with his fingers. ‘There,’ he says after a while. ‘That should do it.’ And all of them do seem to do a remarkable amount of good. Rowan starts to swim, to do maths and to play practical jokes. Yet it gradually become clear that there’s also a large element of self-deception here. Now aged 12, Rowan may be much improved, but he’s not cured, nothing like it. It’s also impossible to work out how much of this improvement is due to the various shamen and how much to the unstinting care and attention that Isaacson and his wife lavish on Rowan. Indeed, they devote their lives so wholeheartedly to him — teaching him on horseback and even bouncing on a trampoline because it makes him more responsive — that it finally drives them apart. You get the feeling too that Isaacson is such a sucker for New Age theories that it’s sent him a bit doolally. While he starts off the book by seeking a cure, he soon starts moving the goalposts and ends up by saying that ‘autism is not a problem to be fixed. Autism is a collection of gifts, a skill set, a wonderful way of being.’ Is it really? Or is this just another sign of desperation, of someone frantically searching for the good in any situation, however bleak? But Isaacson then goes several stages further by suggesting that autistic people might be the forerunners of new, more evolved, less egotistical human beings: ‘Do we as autistic parents have a front-row seat at the accelerated evolution of our species?’ he wonders. The answer to that, I would suggest, is a resounding no. Yet despite spiralling off into battiness, there is enough here to suggest that something — be it the power of mind, ritual or maybe magic itself — can help bring an autistic child from near total darkness out into the world.","Author Rupert Isaacson sent his autistic son to a shaman who had both parents whipped and their genitals anointed with 'sacred vodka'

"By . Peter Lewis . There is a plateau in central France where visitors are few and winters cold and long-lasting. South-west of Lyon, it rises steeply amid pine forests to a bleak and windswept plain, with only a few hamlets and widely scattered farm houses as habitation. In the midst of it is the village of Le Chambon. Until France fell in summer 1940, and Le Chambon became part of unoccupied Vichy France, you would hardly have known there was a war on. Then the refugees started to arrive. They were wanted by the Germans for various reasons as resisters, communists or Jews. Many were Jewish children who had escaped the round-ups that ended up in their arrested parents taking the fatal train journey to the death camps in the East. Secret lives: Jewish and Christian children of one of Le Chambon's children's homes during World War II . A network of relief organisations was formed whose priority was to save them. Increasingly they sent them to Le Chambon, where they would be billeted in houses or on isolated farms. The people of the plateau for the most part were staunchly Protestant. They had Huguenot traditions of defying persecution. They were also close-mouthed and averse to gossip. The effect of their austere silent lifestyle frustrated the Vichy authorities when they decided to raid the plateau looking for Jews. Some 50 police and gendarmes from the Departement Haute-Loire were sent up in trucks and ordered the mayor and the leading Pastor, Andre Trocme, to hand over the names of all Jews in the area. They refused. Good deeds never forgotten: The Memorial Museum in Le Chambon . Trocme, a charismatic preacher with a very large following, said he had no idea if any of his parishioners were Jewish and he would not tell them if they were. He was ordered to instruct the Jews to come forward. Instead he told them to disappear. Next morning in church  he told his flock they should ‘Obey God rather than man’.  The police had their own list of 72 Jews and proceeded to search the village, combing cellars and attics. They found nobody. So they set out to search the countryside. Again they found nothing but empty rooms. ‘Can’t think where they’ve gone,’ said one pastor in charge of a hostel. ‘They were here yesterday.’ ‘Yesterday’ he had taken them all to the forests. This game of hide and seek went on for  three weeks. At night the children were hidden in remote farmhouses in attics, behind wood piles or in cupboards whenever the gendarmes came. One farmer asked them: ‘What do Jews look like? I hear they have big noses.’ A list of addresses was mysteriously pinned up in Le Chambon. It was of places which the police planned to visit. They also helpfully spent their spare time in the cafes talking loudly about where they planned to go next. One Englishwoman in the village, Miss Gladys Maber, a Christian socialist from Portsmouth, ran a home for school children. Asked by a police lieutenant if she knew of any Jews in the area, she demanded why he wanted to know. He said if she signed a declaration that there were none, the police would probably be withdrawn. She signed. The lieutenant sat at her piano and played God Save The King, and told her he would be back ‘with champagne’ when the British won the war. Hunting refugees: Two Jewish resistance fighters are arrested by German troops in Poland, 1943 . After three weeks, only one Jew had been found, an Austrian who was carried off weeping, but he was soon returned as ‘insufficiently Jewish’. All other Jews on the list had vanished. The prefect of the Departement, Robert Bach, reported to Vichy that the police had failed to find any Jews on the plateau. They had probably fled because it was too cold to survive in the forests. It seems probable that Bach had allowed advance warning of the search to be given. Invasion: Nazi occupied France as portrayed during the filming of 'Charlotte Gray' Caroline Moorehead is not the first to have written of this remarkable safe enclave, but she has investigated the most thoroughly, tracking down survivors among the protectors and among the children. She tells their individual stories in copious detail and they are by no means all sweetness and light. Many survivors, especially orphaned children, were permanently scarred by their ordeal. The most remarkable thing about this rescue of perhaps 800 Jewish children — plus some 3,000 who passed through Le Chambon en route to safety across the Swiss border — was the scale of the cover-up. France has a notorious record for collaboration and denunciation during the German occupation. There was no shortage of informers in Paris or other cities. Yet on the plateau nobody peached. Even the local German army commander was said to have thrown anonymous letters of denunciation into the wastepaper basket. Imprisonment and torture: Adolf Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, tortured the villagers to tray and get information . Proportionate to population, more Jews were saved on the plateau centred on Le Chambon than anywhere else in France. But some rescuers paid a high price. Several women organisers who rescued Jewish children ended up in Ravensbruck concentration camp. The popular and reckless local GP, Dr Roger Le Forestier, was murdered by the Germans, while Marianne Cohn, who conducted parties of children to the Swiss border by night, was caught 200 yards short of it and handed over to the Germans. She was imprisoned and tortured by the Gestapo trying to get information on her colleagues. Then she was taken with other Resistance prisoners to an isolated spot where they were battered to death with spades. Marianne left behind the most haunting poem written about Vichy France. It read: . I shall betray tomorrow,  not today. Today, pull out  my fingernails, . I shall not betray. The file is under  the window. The file is not for  the window bars . It is for my wrists. I shall betray tomorrow. Today I have nothing to say. Full of unpleasant and gritty details of life in France under the Germans, this is an inspiring book.","During WW2 thousands of refugees hid in the village of Le Chambon .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . and Gerard Couzens . Michael Douglas’s former wife has criticised Catherine Zeta Jones after apparently accusing her of selling her private life. Diandra Douglas launched the thinly-veiled attack on the Welsh actress in an interview from the home in Majorca which she still shares with the Hollywood star. It seems to be related to Zeta Jones and her husband selling pictures of themselves and family – including their 2000 wedding – to glossy magazines. Scroll down for video . Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas have sold pictures of themselves and family – including their 2000 wedding – to glossy magazines . Asked about rumours that Zeta Jones, who is back with Douglas after a brief separation, had tried to buy her half share of the Spanish villa, she retorted: ‘It’s not true. Sometimes people say things without the slightest proof. ‘Why would someone who doesn’t speak Spanish or the local Majorcan language or knows nothing about this culture want a house here? She doesn’t even come here much.’ And responding to a question about why she was ‘less visible’ on the Spanish resort than the Hollywood actors now, Diandra, 56, added: ‘That’s because I don’ t believe in showing off. ‘I’ve never sold photos or kept money from anything and I’ve always given everything away to charity. ‘I’m proud to be able to say that I’ve never turned my private life into showbusiness. ‘Too much public exposure affects children.’ Diandra, Douglas’s wife of 18 years, also revealed she and her jailed son Cameron, 35, ‘meditated for his freedom’ every night for 15 minutes at the same time. The two Mrs Michael Douglases: Dianda (left) and the current wife Catherine Zeta Jones (right) Both the Wall Street star, and Diandra have spoken out in support of Cameron who was sentenced to nine-and-a-half-years in prison in 2010 for selling methamphetamine and heroin possession. A US judge nearly doubled his sentence after he was found guilty of repeatedly breaking prison rules by arranging to get drugs. He was placed in solitary confinement for several months after failing a prison drugs test - and is not scheduled for release until 2018. Diandra said she can now visit him every other weekend following his release from solitary but told respected Spanish newspaper El Mundo: ‘Putting a drug addict in a jail is like putting a diabetic in a cake shop without treatment. ‘It’s horrible that someone with money and famous parents should receive such tough punishment.’ She also insisted reports she had lost a recent court battle for half Michael Douglas’s salary and royalties from 2010 Wall Street sequel Wall Street 2, were wrong. Diandra was widely reported to have lost a fight to get her hands on the huge fee the actor earned for his role as Gordon Gekko. But she insisted she had instructed lawyers to halt her claim after learning he was ill with cancer. Douglas married Zeta Jones in 2000. Together they have two children Dylan, 12, and Carys, 10 . Douglas, 69, and Diandra divorced in 2000 after 23 years of marriage which she entered while just 19. But last year, he admitted that they should have split much sooner. ‘I know I’m going to get into trouble here,’ he said. ‘I have nothing against her and in fact I’m very fond of my first wife. But we should have ended that marriage eight or 10 years earlier. ‘It took me too long to realise that if you go to a marriage counsellor to resolve problems, it’s in his interest to keep the marriage going. ‘Because if I end the marriage he’s got no business. I think Diandra would probably say the same thing. That’s the only clear regret that I have.’ Douglas married Zeta Jones in 2000. Together they have two children Dylan, 12, and Carys, 10. He recently revealed he is relishing being a father a second time around. ‘I love kids and I love having had this second chance to have a family,’ he said. ‘There’s something about the innocence and unequivocal love that children have. You’re just their dad and there’s a complete love without them having any judgment, so I can enjoy that a lot.’ Douglas - who has recovered since he was diagnosed with stage-four throat cancer in 2010 - said he likes playing with his children.","Diandra Douglas unhappy ex-husband sells photos of his family to media .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The woman dubbed the 'poker princess' for her role playing hostess to the rich and famous at high stakes poker games has opened up about her illustrious clientele. A memoir of Molly Bloom's time running the most exclusive poker game in Hollywood entitled Molly's Game, set to be published next Tuesday, is sure to have her former clients - actors, athletes, politicians and financial titans - slightly nervous about her revelations. Last . month, Bloom, 36, pleaded guilty to illegal gambling and was . sentenced to 12 months probation and given a $1000 fine for her part in a high-profile gambling ring that attracted Hollywood heavyweights such as Ben . Affleck, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. Dishing the dirt: Molly Bloom, pictured in May, is opening up about her former life as the organizer of a high-stakes poker game . Valued for her discretion and paid generously for her confidentiality, Bloom was privy to some of the world's juiciest gossip. She told ABC's 20/20 that during her games, players had 'six-figure losses, six-figure wins,' and that she herself earned $4 million in one year alone. Tobey Maguire, she says, was a great player but a sore loser and worse tipper. 'I used to call Tobey ""Hannibal Lecter"" because he could just talk someone off of a good hand,' Bloom told 20/20. In an adaptation of her book published in Vanity Fair earlier this month, Bloom wrote that the Seabiscuit star once told her to 'bark like a seal who wants a fish' for a chip. Poker face: Tobey Maguire was allegedly a great player but a bad loser and worse tipper . Good will: 'Tall and handsome' Affleck was a regular player, said Bloom, while Matt Damon was polite and mild-mannered . 'I'm not kidding,' he allegedly said to her. 'What's wrong? You’re too rich now? You won’t bark for a thousand dollars?' The gambling goddess said that she refused to stoop to the level of barking, and that in return: 'He gave me an icy look, dropped the chip on the table and tried to laugh it off but he was visibly angry.' Maguire would use his close friend Leonardo DiCaprio to attract bigger players to the game, she said. Another way she placated demanding gamblers like Maguire, Bloom said, was to invite top sportsmen into the game. 'A-Rod was a novice player, but there’s something that happens to grown men, no matter how successful they are, when a professional athlete comes into the room,' Bloom said of baseballer Alex Rodriguez. Novice: Alex Rodriguez wasn't an experienced player, but his presence at the table thrilled the other gamblers . Poker princess: Bloom says that since 2011, she's returned to 'a life that has meaning and substance' and works for a friend's business earning $19 an hour . In her book, Bloom claims Pamela Anderson's husband Rick Salomon asked Ben Affleck: 'Did Jennifer’s ass have cellulite on it, or was it nice?' The Argo star is said to have held his silence for a moment before conceding, in front of a room full of celebrities, that 'it was nice.' Ex-girlfriends aside, Molly also writes that having Affleck involved in the games was 'monumental' and that 'he was tall and handsome with a relaxed charisma that not all icons have in person.' But Jennifer Garner's husband didn't go all-in too quickly, according to the Poker Princess. He was 'a smart player who liked to limit his downside,' with his buy-in being comparatively small at $50,000. His Good Will Hunting pal Matt Damon, she told 20/20, was nothing like his poker-addict Rounders character, and turned up only once. 'He was lovely, modest, down-to-earth, very gracious,' Bloom said. Titanic wins: Leonardo DiCaprio was a regular player in Bloom's circle, which had a buy-in of up to $100,000 . Molly also reveals that Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen were responsible for bringing in a billionaire to her table. 'When the Olsen twins showed up with a billionaire I was trying to land for a game, they were in, no questions asked,' she writes. Things fell apart for Bloom when she began demanding a cut of the pot, instead of just relying on tips, which turned her actions into organized crime. Bloom told 20/20 that when she declined the demands of two mobsters for a piece of her profits, she was beaten up in her own apartment by a hired goon. Soon after, one of her games was raided by the FBI and her bank accounts were frozen. Bloom told the court last month that since 2011, she had returned to 'a life that has meaning and substance.'","Molly Bloom, 36, pleaded guilty to illegal gambling last month .

But now the Stephen Perse Foundation – whose pupils’ delinquent antics were loosely depicted in the St Trinians cartoons and novels – is to break from tradition by opening its doors to boys for the first time in more than a century. The first seven and eight-year-old boys will begin at the Foundation, a group of five independent schools whose fees cost up to £15,000-a-year, next month. Unruly: Boys will join the Stephen Perse Foundation, Cambridge, in September. It is the school that sketch-artist Ronald Searle used as his inspiration for the anarchic girls' school St Trinians, starring Gemma Arterton . They will move up to the junior school from the Foundation’s pre-prep school, which already caters for male pupils. Although the sexes will still be kept apart for some lessons, new toilets and classrooms have been built, and new sports equipment purchased, to ensure the boys are properly catered for. By Year Five girls and boys will have separate classes for traditional subjects such as English, maths, science, personal, sexual and health education and some sports. The senior school, for children aged 11 to 16, will be open to boys from 2018. Sketch-artist Ronald Searle partly based his anarchic boarding school of unruly girls in gym slips, led by an eccentric headmistress, on the Perse School for Girls and the Cambridge High School for Girls, both based in the city. Named after Dr Stephen Perse, the English academic and philanthropist, the school, which opened in 1881, was originally known as the Perse School for Girls, before changing its name in 2007. The Foundation’s pre-prep school, for children aged three to seven, and its sixth form college have allowed boys to attend since 2008 and 2010, respectively. Although the junior school admitted boy pupils for a brief period in the late 19th century, it is more than 132 years since they were regulars. Economist John Maynard Keynes was one of the last males to be educated there. Hit: The fictional establishment became a hit in novels, cartoons and films starring Rupert Everett as matron . Searle, who died in 2011, attended Boys’ Central School in Cambridge and based St Trinians on encounters with the girls from both local schools on his way home. His spindly cartoons of naughty schoolgirls first appeared in 1941 and were later made into a series of books and films. The most recent adaptation in 2007 starred Gemma Arterton, Colin Firth And comedian Russell Brand. Twins Aaran and Kamran Bennett, seven, will be among the first boys admitted to the junior school in September. Their parents Sevarin and Ivan, from Whittlesford, Cambs, quickly signed them up in the hope they will benefit from teaching at the school which their daughter Maria, 10, ‘loved.’ Yesterday the boys said they were ‘really looking forward to playing in the junior school playground.’ Headteacher Tricia Kelleher said the school, which charges between £3,495 and £5,135 a term, would ‘remain true to its single sex roots.’ But she said it was ‘unfair’ that girls ‘should have all the fun.’ ‘Keeping a distinctive approach to teaching boys and girls is still important to us,’ she added. ‘That is why we will be opting for the ‘diamond’ approach where boys and girls are taught most of their lessons in different classes.’","Stephen Perse Foundation, Cambridge, inspired hit cartoons and novels .

The group of hens, including Abby Ashcroft pictured third from left, out together the night before she was left in tears after being denied entry to the club - despite having their names on the door for the night . She has now spoken of how she broke down in tears after they told her she couldn't go in with flat shoes on. Mrs Ashcroft, who is married and has a two-year-old daughter, has called the door worker ‘arrogant’ and said she felt discriminated against for being pregnant. She added: 'I’m annoyed to say I cried. This woman upset me, I couldn’t help it. I’m not an emotional person. I don’t really get upset but this shocked me. I felt victimised. We were all sober and dressed well. It didn’t make sense.' She added: 'Not to toot my own horn, but I did look very nice. Full make up, hair extensions, a lovely maternity dress, gorgeous jewelery, nails done. I really did feel a million dollars. 'When we arrived at the club there was no queue, however the clip board lady made us wait 10 minutes. 'Fair enough, I assumed it must be busy inside. During that time a few people joined the queue but were asked to leave because of trainers and jeans. Then after 10 minutes the clip board lady asked everyone in our party to put our hands up. I assumed this was so that she could let us all in together. 'No one else had left the club and I thought that was unusual as I'd assumed a one in, one out system, which would have explained our wait at the door. 'All the girls were dressed fabulously with designer dresses and accessories. The clipboard lady looked everyone in our group up and down and stopped at me: ""You can't get in here with flats on,"" she said. I honestly thought she was joking, ""I'm pregnant!"", I said, and all the other girls chimed in. 'She laughed again and then said in an extremely arrogant tone: ""Fortunately when I was pregnant, I was still able to wear heels. You can't come in"".' Mrs Ashcroft, who lives in Durham, said she had rarely gone on nights out during her pregnancy but decided to travel to Manchester for best pal Gemma Pedersen’s hen weekend. But she told how she was left feeling 'subdued’ after being turned away. She was wearing these shoes when she was told she couldn't enter the club while wearing flats . She was left in tears after a staff member at Club Liv, pictured, told her she could not enter wearing flats . Mrs Ashcroft, who is expecting a daughter in late September, added: 'It made me feel like I didn’t belong and should have confined myself to the nursery knitting cardigans for my new arrival rather than supporting my friend. I’ve never been made to feel like that before during either pregnancy. 'I was having such a nice time in Manchester. It’s such a big city so you expect people to just shove past you but everyone had been unbelievably friendly - holding doors open for me and offering to carry my bag. 'Saturday night soured that and put a dampener on it for the other girls as they were worried about me.' Abby intends to complain to bosses at Liv, which opened in April and is the brainchild of Mo Mohamud, former manager of celeb-haunt bar The Circle, which closed last year.

"By . Damien Gayle . Adopting a lifestyle of varied, regular exercise is generally understood as the only real route to an athletic physique. However there are those who cannot bear the thought of having to get all sweaty as they strive to carve their body into a facsimile of Greek statuary. If that sounds like you, then help is finally at hand. A Florida-based company is marketing a new contraption that will allow you ride an exercise bike while taking a bath at the same time. Biking in the bath: The FitWet incorporates an exercise with a jacuzzi-style tub for a novel new workout experience which, its makers claim, offers a range of unique benefits . The makers of the Fitwet claim it offers '12 times higher intensity' than regular, bog-standard standalone exercise bikes, while helping users avoid the fatigue associated with working out. Moreover, the company claims, their machine's 12 integral water jest 'exert a massaging action and especially a draining one which allows strong reduction of the cellulite'. Yes, it's an exercise bike - in a bathtub: But the FitWet's makers claim makers say it offers benefits that regular bike workouts cannot . Like any other exercise bike the FitWet targets the lower body, offering a workout to the quadriceps and buttocks, with general overall benefit to cardiovascular health. But its makers say it offers many benefits that regular bike workouts cannot. 'Sweating in the water enables to regulate the body temperature and to refresh it during the effort,' the company says. 'It also carries a part of its weight, and the ozone provides a sensation of relaxation and well being. 'On the other side, water resistance increases the intensity of the effort, and allows to improve the muscle balance and requests the participation of all the muscles of legs, torso, arms and back. 'While pedalling in the air burns a maximum of 400cal/hour for user in perfect physical condition, and generates sweating, pain, and articular issues, we observe that pedalling in water allows to avoid all those issues, and to bring a 800cal/hour result even for beginners.' 'Massaging and draining action': The FitWet's 12 integral water jets are purported to offer a novel, low-effort solution to the reduction of cellulite . Cellulite is a skin change that occurs in between 80-90 per cent of adult women. Visible as dimpling and nodularity of skin, it is caused by the herniation of subcutaneous fat within fibrous connective tissue. The term was first used in the Twenties, and began appearing in English language publications in the late Sixties, with the earliest reference in Vogue magazine. Its existence as a real disorder has been questioned, and the prevailing medical opinion is that it is merely the 'normal condition of many women', according to Wikipedia. Most enticingly for prospective . female customers, the FitWet claims to offer a solution to cellulite, a . skin change caused by the the herniation of subcutaneous fat which . occurs in 80-90 per cent of adult women. 'The jets exert a massaging action and especially a draining one: strong reduction of the cellulite, of the orange skin and of the retention of water,' the makers say. 'In the course of the Jet Bike sessions, the waist refines, the buttocks and legs are invigorated.' The U.S.-made FitWet has a range of features to entice potential customers. It has the obligatory high-tech LED touch screen, drinks holder, heart rate monitor and calorie counter, while the 'triple thick saddle' suggests a comfortable ride for flabby bums. According to the maker's website, it also inexplicably ships with a towel. Of course, you could always just go for a swim instead.","The FitWet offers '12 times higher intensity' than regular exercise bikes, its makers say .

"By . Alan Roden . Scottish soldiers will desert Alex Salmond’s independent army to fight alongside their British comrades if the SNP wins next year’s referendum. A devastating new study which quizzed servicemen has left the Nationalists’ defence blueprint in tatters, concluding that Mr Salmond’s proposals ‘do not withstand serious scrutiny’. For the first time, serving soldiers were asked for their views and ‘a majority – perhaps even a large majority’ would prefer to remain with the British Armed Forces’ because they will see action instead of spending their time in Scotland 'thumb twiddling’. Scroll down for video . Desertion: Troops in Scottish regiments will reject Alex Salmond's independent army, a new report reveals, raising doubts about the future of regiments like the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders pictured on a parade through Port Glasgow Town last month . In one platoon, 30 of the 32 men who returned from Afghanistan earlier this year said they would not join a Scottish defence force (SDF). One soldier was undecided and another admitted he would join the SDF for an easier life, adding: ‘All we’d be doing is checking passports on the M6.’ One officer questioned why a young Scottish man would sign up to ‘sit on the border in Cyprus or Lebanon with a blue beret and no rounds in his rifle’ when he could instead train at Sandhurst and join an elite fighting force. The findings have raised fears of a ‘two-tier’ military structure in Scotland, with the brightest and best youngsters choosing to defend Britain before transferring to the SDF once they are married, have children and want to ‘calm down a bit later in life’. Scotland would also need its own special forces to protect the North Sea oil rigs, but there would be a major recruitment crisis because the job would involve ‘thumb twiddling’. Other findings in the 128-page report from the highly respected Henry Jackson Society include: . The report, launched in Edinburgh today, has been written by defence expert and author George Grant. He has previously provided briefings to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. Latest figures show that Scotland’s notional share of the UK’s defence budget was nearly £3.3billion in 2011-12. The SNP has drawn up plans to spend £2.5billion on a 15,000-strong Scottish military if there is a ‘yes’ vote in next year’s referendum, although it claims this is around £500million more than is currently spent within Scotland’s borders. Check point: The report is a devastating blow to Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who yesterday launched the official 2014 Ryder Cup Tartan at Lochcarron of Scotland mill in Selkirk, Borders with tournament director Richard Hills . Mr Grant’s report concludes that ‘if one is being objective on this subject, it is almost impossible not to arrive at the conclusion that – as things currently stand – defence policy is one of the SNP’s weak points’. ‘This is not because they have attempted to put forward a fully thought-through defence strategy that nevertheless appears to have some deficiencies, but rather because their strategy appears to be predicated more on how not to alienate voters, than on how to actually defend Scotland.’ He adds: ‘It is the considered conclusion of this report that not only have the SNP failed to answer most questions adequately to date, but that any – if not the majority – of their proposals for defence do not withstand serious scrutiny.’ The SNP wants to keep all of Scotland’s historic Army regiments, but that would require around 14,000 personnel – leaving just 1,000 for an air force and a navy. And one of the major problems would be persuading Scots soldiers to desert the British Armed Forces. One officer told the report’s author: ‘What of the young officer born, raised, and educated in Scotland? He can either join the Paras [British Army Parachute Regiment] or the local Scots regiment. ‘If he chooses the latter, he cannot go to Sandhurst; so he would be going to a new training school in Scotland, with the best hope of going and sitting on the border in Cyprus or Lebanon with a blue beret and no rounds in his rifle. ‘Or he can join the Paras, one of the most recognisable regiments in the world. What’s he going to do? It’s a no brainer; the SDF would be too dead-end and too parochial.’ The officer said the SDF would be staffed by ‘second-class Scots soldiers’. Elite: Scottish troops would prefer to train at Sandhurst in Berkshire (pictured) before fighting on the frontline around the world, instead of joining peacekeeping operations with a Scottish force . Defence experts Professor Sir Hew Strachan told Mr Grant: ‘I can envisage a two-tier military service, where ambitious young Scots join the British Army, and then, once he’s married and got children and wants to calm down a bit later in life, he transfers to the Scottish Army.’ The report outlines potential massive job losses in the shipyards and at the Faslane naval base on the Clyde, where the UK’s Trident nuclear missile system is based. But it also warns of the impact on defence companies. ‘Privately, concerns have been raised about the potential loss of access to the world’s second-largest defence market, and there have been some discussions about the possibility of relocation south of the border in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote in 2014,’ it claims. Criticism: Labour's shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said the SNP's plans are NP defence plans are 'quarter-baked' ‘One well-placed source told this report . that, following discussions he had had with the board of one of the big . defence companies, ‘they said quite clearly that, if Scotland became . independent, they would move their operation out from near Edinburgh’. The company in question employs several thousand people in Scotland who, . the source said, would consequently lose their jobs.’ Addressing military infrastructure, the study found that the Eurofighter Typhoon would likely be too ‘expensive and complex’ for a separate Scotland, while the ageing Tornado GR4 ‘lacks an air-to-air capability’ and the Hawk trainer is ‘comparatively slow, with no radar and only limited offensive capability’. ‘Therefore, it would be unable to fulfil the air-defence function envisaged by the party,’ the report states. The study also suggests that purchasing four diesel-powered submarines would cost Scotland up to £2.6billion, which is described as ‘prohibitive’. Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said: ‘It’s official. The SNP defence plans are quarter-baked. ‘There’s a growing army of experts who have shown just how flawed their defence plans are. The defence and security of Scotland’s people and national interests must be the top priority, but all we get from the SNP is political posturing.’ But a spokesman for the Scottish Government said an independent Scotland would have ‘first-class conventional forces which will play a full role in defending the country and cooperating with international partners’. ‘Scotland stands to inherit a fair share of existing UK defence assets, and an annual defence and security budget of £2.5billion would represent an increase of more than £500million on recent UK levels of defence spending in Scotland,’ he said. ‘We have also been clear that we will retain all current defence bases, including Faslane - which will be Scotland’s main conventional naval facility – and our long-term commitment will ensure continued support for jobs and local economies in all the communities around Scotland that are home to military bases.’","Damning report reveals reluctance of soldiers to join Alex Salmond's army .

"By . Damian Mcbride . When Gordon told me he saw Ed Miliband as a potential Labour leader, I was incredulous. It was the party conference of 2007, and Gordon — now in No 10 — wanted something to distract the media from speculation about a possible snap election. ‘Build up the young guys,’ he said. ‘Turn it into a beauty contest about who’ll take over from me.’ I asked him who he wanted me to mention to the media as potential contenders. Game of thrones: Gordon Brown keeps Ed Balls close at the 2009 Labour Party Conference but secretly favoured Ed Miliband . He reeled off surnames like a football manager naming his line-up: ‘Purnell. Miliband. Kelly. Burnham. Cooper. Balls. Miliband.’ I replied: ‘You’ve already said Miliband.’ ‘Both of them,’ he said. ‘Really?’ I said, surprised. ‘You want me to say Ed Miliband?’ Gordon was adamant: ‘You need to watch Ed Miliband, he’s the one to watch.’ I could understand Ed Balls being on the list, because the only thing he lacked was confidence in public speaking which — while it was clearly a very big deal — was something he could improve. But for all his academic and emotional intelligence, his confidence and good humour, I’d never seen Ed Miliband as a potential leader until then. First, because I’d never seen the drive and ambition it’s now clear he possessed, and second because he’d have to get past his brother, the guy who used to send him curt emails from No 10 saying: ‘Get this sorted.’ But when I thought about it — more than once when deliberations were going on about a snap election in 2007, and what that would mean for the timing of the next one — I’d heard Ed Miliband say: ‘I’d fancy a post-Olympics election in 2012.’ Whether that was ‘I’ speaking for the Labour Party, or for himself, or indeed for both, was never quite clear. So it wasn’t too incongruous to hear Gordon talking up Ed Miliband’s chances. Then he added: ‘You know you’ll have to choose between them one day. Who will you back?’ ‘I’m closer to Ed Miliband,’ I said, which was undoubtedly true at the time — I didn’t send Ed Balls text messages about football or gossip to him about which Treasury civil servants might have the hots for each other. ‘Don’t base it on who you’re close to,’ Gordon said. ‘Base it on who you believe in.’ Looking back, I think it was a mistake for Gordon to say to people that we’d one day have to choose between the Eds. People like me who’d always seen them as indivisible began seeing them as separate entities, and — over time — camps grew up, with the inevitable rivalry, distrust and sniping that followed. The team around Gordon, which had always been remarkable for its unity, suddenly developed fissures. The . fact that Ed Miliband zealots later used my sacking as an opportunity . to give anonymous and aggressive briefings against Ed Balls — despite . the damage that would do to Gordon as well – was a sign of how bad . things got. It would not . have been unreasonable for Gordon to say — much as the Milibands’ mother . did during their contest — that he would never take sides between the . two Eds, or expect his advisers to do so. So why didn’t he? Because deep down, he knew one day he’d probably have to choose himself. If . David Miliband emerged as a leadership front-runner, determined, as . Gordon would see it, to take the party down routes he had resisted for . more than a decade — creeping privatisation of public services, closer . integration with Europe — he would have to try to stop him. That . would mean backing the candidate that he felt was best able to set out . an alternative, Brownite vision — and ultimately the candidate most . likely to win. When that contest materialised almost as exactly as feared in 2010, Gordon, however uncomfortable it felt, was forced to pick a favoured candidate between the Eds, and use whatever influence he had to try to secure them votes. By that stage, I was long gone from Downing Street, but people try everything and everyone when the leadership is on the line. That September, rumours began to circulate that Ed Balls might cut a late deal with David Miliband, where David would accept Ed’s position on the pace of deficit reduction and proclaim his attributes as a potential shadow Chancellor, in return for which Ed would withdraw from the race and urge his supporters to switch allegiance to David. My mobile, usually silent those days, started to ring again: Gordon and others close to him urged me that — if I had any influence over Ed Balls or his team — I should tell him he had to reject any deal offered by David, and instead pursue the same deal with Ed Miliband. It would be ‘madness’, they said, if he backed David to be leader, not Ed. I said I wasn’t in a position to help even if I wanted to. As it was, Balls made clear he wasn’t interested in any deals, and neither Miliband brother was inclined to offer one. So it came to nothing, but did very clearly expose where Gordon had his colours nailed. And just as Ed Miliband can very cogently justify why he felt compelled to challenge his brother, I’m sure Gordon could equally well explain why he felt obliged privately to back Ed Miliband over Ed Balls, while remaining publicly neutral. Both saw their decisions as means to the most important end — victory in the battle for the soul of the Labour Party. That was all that mattered, even if it meant Ed Balls limping away from the field feeling just as bruised as David Miliband. If Labour is in power after the 2015 election, either in its own right or in coalition, with Ed Miliband installed as Prime Minister and Ed Balls as Chancellor, I’m sure they’ll invite Gordon to the first Downing Street Christmas party, and get him to tell his ‘Japanese Admiral’ joke for old time’s sake. Perhaps the three will reflect on how far they’ve come since they first started working together in Gordon’s opposition office 21 years before. And perhaps they can all shake hands then, and let all the fissures of the past be healed, and every bygone be bygone. ■ Extracted from Power Trip by Damian McBride, to be published by Biteback on September 25 at £20. © 2013 Damian McBride.

Indeed, few fathers have influenced their politician sons as much as Ralph Miliband, a refugee from Nazi-occupied Belgium who rose to become one of the top academic analysts on modern socialism. The policies of New Labour would probably have appalled Ralph, who died in 1994, and his younger son would doubtless have sympathised — though he was in no position to change things. Now, of course, he is. It’s hard to listen to any of Ed Miliband’s occasionally tortured, over-academic speeches without hearing his father’s voice, especially when he talks about recasting the capitalist model and re-shaping society through the empowerment of ordinary people. And that’s not just about Ed’s politics; it’s also undoubtedly central to how he explains to himself and to the rest of his family why he challenged his older brother for the Labour leadership. Inspiration: Ed Miliband with his father Ralph in 1989 at home . What better reason than needing to achieve his father’s vision and ensure David Miliband did not traduce it? An act of supposed disloyalty to his brother becomes transformed in his mind into the ultimate act of tribute to his father. At the Treasury, the two Eds were a double act. The idea Miliband was ever made to feel subordinateto Balls is baloney, along with the myth of him bringing Balls his morning coffee. However, Ed Miliband often found himself acting as confidant for some of the more sensitive Treasury ministers and advisers who occasionally felt ignored or dismissed by Balls, and it was natural for Miliband to sympathise and say he knew what they were going through; it was the same for him. Whether that was just good management, or artful bolstering of his clique, it worked. When the two stood against each other for the Labour leadership, it was interesting to watch how many of those who had cried on Ed Miliband’s shoulder joined his camp, while the more robust types were firmly with Balls. But if Ed Miliband did snipe about Ed Balls behind closed doors, it was never reciprocated. The first time I ever heard Balls say anything remotely negative about Miliband was at the end of 2008, when the latter effectively threatened to resign from the Cabinet if a decision was made to build a third runway at Heathrow. Balls was genuinely outraged that Miliband could ignore the need to expand airport capacity just for the sake of his reputation with the green lobby and his own political positioning. He was also angry that Gordon had been made to look weak in front of his Cabinet at a time when he was already so vulnerable, by having to kowtow to a supposed ally. A clear subtext to Ed Balls’s irritation that day was seeing his former junior partner so brazenly betraying his political ambitions. Doubtless David Miliband felt the same way. You could see that same irritation again and again during the leadership hustings in 2010, Balls and David regularly exchanging looks of incredulity when they’d hear Ed Miliband distance himself from New Labour.","When Gordon Brown told Damian McBride he saw Ed Miliband as a intentional leader he didn't believe him .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Katy Winter . Heiress and society 'it' girl Tamara Ecclestone caused a stir last year when she revealed that she had spent an unbelievable £1m on a crystal bathtub. Miss Ecclestone ‘dispatched’ five minions on an . expedition up the Amazon to gather the crystal used to create the state-of- the-art bathtub for her £47m London home, but if you have been inspired by her blinging bathroom you only need to go as far as London department store Harrods. The Catchpole & Rye Crystal Bateau is a tad cheaper too, priced at £150,000. The Swarovski Crystal Petit Bateau bath from Catchpole & Rye takes over 200 man hours to create and will set you back £150,000 . The all white crystals appear to give a uniform glitter, but four different types of Swarovski crystals are used to obtain the effect . Forget paying off the mortgage or . putting your children through private school — for £150,000 (or . just £120,000 for a slightly smaller Baby Bateau) craftsmen will laboriously stick 22,000 white Swarovski crystals . to a hand-made cast-iron tub for a glittery Saturday Night Fever effect. Catchpole & Rye . is the only bathroom company who manufacture exclusively in England and . the bath is made in their Kent foundry using traditional methods and . employing artisan techniques in every part of the process. The claw footed bath is a surefire way to add some glamour to your bathroom, and can be covered in different colours of crystal such as pink, blue or green . Why not bling up your bathroom with a Swarovski encrusted tub from Catchpole & Rye? The bath is made from cast metal with an enamel interior, and thousands . of crystals have been painstakingly applied by hand taking over 200 . hundred hours to turn the Swarovski Element Saracen bath into a real . object d’art. The Swarovski . crystals are all white, of four different plates and applied in . meticulous fashion, each being individually stuck on by hand to . emphasise the light refracting properties of the glass and create a . truly sparkling effect. Tamara Ecclestone's extravagant tub is part of the growing trend of bling bathrooms . Tamara's bathtub was created from crystal specially sourced from the Amazon, and required her bathroom floor to be enhanced to take its weight . Catchpole & Rye use traditional methods and craftsmanship to create the baths- which are made-to-order . Catchpole & Rye have also created a bejewelled version of their beautiful ‘Baby Bateau’ bath, which  carries the slightly cheaper price tag of £120,000. Four different types of Swarovski crystal are used on the bath as a single size failed to create the right level of razzle-dazzle reflection. Sticking on thousands of tiny crystals is an unfeasibly intricate process and the craftsmen at Catchpole and Rye have come up with a rather ingenious solution. They apply the crystals using the end of a pencil covered in Bluetac! This allows them to individually pick up and place the crystals onto the bath where they are glued into position. The baby bath is finished with thousands of a single style of crystal creating a consistent glittering effect. And . if white isn't your thing, the made-to-order tub can be covered in . several shades of Swarovski crystal options, including gold, blue and green . crystals. Personal customisation is available, and Catchpole & Rye will painstakingly spell out names or even create crests and logos in different coloured crystals. Managing Director Tony O'Donnell says of creating the spectacular, and unusual bath: 'It was to do something exotic. We did a job for a princess in the middle east and she was very much into her bling, and that's where the idea stems from.' Defending the tubs undeniably hefty price tag Tony says: 'If you have the money, you want the bath, then the price isn't the issue . 'There is a huge amount of work that goes into it, hundreds of hours, it's all English craftsmanship . 'It's a one off; where are you going to see another one like it? The reflection off it is just amazing' The tub is being displayed at the Catchpole & Rye showroom in Kent, and is also available to buy from Harrods. And while you are thinking of upgrading your bath then how about the rest of the bathroom (chipped tiles or a bargain suite won’t cut it next to all those shimmering crystals). Why not set your glittering bathtub off with a golden plated sink with crystals on the taps, or, better yet, a Swarovski studded toilet. The 'Isis' collection by designer Jemal Wright of Hollywood . features blinged-out bathroom fixtures including a glittering loo which will set you back $75,000 (about £49,800). And for the discerning toddler, there is the My Carry Potty - . a £700 Swarovski crystal-studded toilet created by Amanda Jenner, which . allows little ones to 'go' in - or on - luxury wherever the need . strikes. Why not keep the glitter theme going with a bejeweled toilet for both you (left, by Jemal Wright) and your toddler (right, by Amanda Jenner), which together will set you back about £50,500 .","The Swarovski Element Saracen bath, by Catchpole & Rye costs £150,000 .

But while Beagles usually track rabbits and deer, in Australia a pack of the dogs are having more fun pursuing a remote control car.

Mr Ison posted the video, which has now been watched over 200,000 times, on YouTube and one commenter exclaimed: 'I could watch this all day.' Scroll down for video . Beagle derby! The hounds chased the blue and red remote control car in a Queensland park . The man, who goes by the name of RedKrawler online, has six Beagles - Sally, Leia, Abby, Keeper, Bolty and Flo - and keeps his online followers up to date with his pets' antics. The 'Beagle derby', as he called it, took place Alexander Clark Park in Loganholme, Queensland. The Beagles are heard barking frantically as they run and chase a blue and red remote control car around an obstacle course and through a tunnel in the video. A man in blue shorts and a cap stands in the middle of the track with the controls, as others watch the dogs from the sidelines of the pen. But the video ends before the dogs actually catch the car. Thrill of the chase! The pack were playing in Alexander Clark Park in Loganholme, Queensland . It's mine! The dogs almost caught the car before it entered a tunnel . 'We met up with some fellow Beagle owners and took some photos of our pack chasing a radio control car around. They enjoyed it - a lot,' Mr Ison wrote on Reddit. He also posted photos on image sharing website Imgur, explaining: 'I think the photos better highlight the majesty of the ears and jowls flying everywhere.' One YouTube user called Melinda Kirby commented on the video: 'I have 5 beagles and I found this hilarious! 'These beagles are having fun and doing what comes naturally: chasing something. Beagles were originally bred to hunt rabbits, and they are wonderful at it.' High and low: The pooches climbed over obstacles to get to the car . Rebecca Ritchie added: 'This is awesome... I need to get one for my Beagle to chase lol. Or find a doggy park full of beagles! ﻿' However, another YouTube user, Mr Johnson, said the video was cruel: 'Those dogs have no idea what that car is and you can tell by the noises they're making that they are really scared.' While Please Ban Me blasted the video as: 'Animal cruelty. This will severely psychologically damage a dog as they are chasing for an object they can never catch. This leads to depression and weight gain. Reported.﻿' A spokesperson for the RSPCA in Queensland told Daily Mail Australia: 'We Wouldn't be investigating something like this as animal cruelty.'","Brisbane man Andrew Ison filmed his Beagles chasing a remote control car .

"By . Emma Thomas . When it comes to creating stylish designs Chinese hairdresser Wang Weibu is quite literally hot stuff. The traditional barber is one of the last still practicing the ancient art of Dahuojia hairdressing, which involves using a pair of red hot metal clamps to burn hair off rather than cut it. If the hair is too long, the clamps are used like a pair of scissors to cut it to the desired length and then the expert slides the burning hot metal over the rest of the hair to create a perm which he claims lasts up to three months. Scroll down for video . Smoking! The red hot metal clamps are used to burn hair off rather than cut it . Traditional: Chinese hairdresser Wang Weibu (left) says business is god but it is mainly older people that come to get their hair cut this way . Hot: The metal clamp is left in a wooden fire until it is red hot, then cooled slightly with water before it is used on the hair for the first time . This traditional method of cutting hair was widespread in China until it went out of fashion in the 1980s. Now hardly anybody wants a haircut using the unusual method. Mr Weibu, 73, said: 'It's not just a shortage of hairdressers offering the method, there are also not very many customers that are interested in it any more. It is mainly older people that come to my shop nowadays. And like me one day they won't be here any more either.' For the moment, however, business is going well at his shop in Jinshi, Santai county in Sichuan province, southwest China. He said: 'My customers agree with me that hair done in this way can keep the same shape for 3 months. It works well.'

The superfan - who says he has watched the film 'thousands and thousands' of times - has spent £120,000 amassing a massive haul of around 10,000 pieces of memorabilia, including a replica of Dorothy's famous ruby slippers. Now the shop manager's collection has grown so big that he is planning to open a museum to share his passion with others. He said: 'My collection means the world to me and I’m determined to turn it into a museum. 'When I was younger I was bullied horribly at school for being gay and when I was 16 my mother passed away.

"By . Sam Webb . Injustice: A rape victim was told that her Spanx tummy control pants (file picture) were one of the reasons the case against her attacker was dropped. File picture . A victim of rape was told that her choice of underwear was one reason the case against her attacker was dropped, as figures show an alarming drop in the number of sex attackers prosecuted. Suzanne (not her real name) was raped by her partner in December 2012 but was told that her Spanx - a type of undergarment that shapes the body - were partly to blame for the case being dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Her story emerges as it is revealed that there were 129 fewer rape suspects convicted of any offence in 2013 than in the year before, while the numbers of rape cases referred to prosecutors for charging has fallen by more than a third since 2011 - despite a rise in offences recorded by police. Suzanne said she was in a sexual relationship with her partner and was planning for him to stay the night but he became aggressive as the evening wore on. They argued in his car outside her house and when she went inside he followed her into the house and raped her. He left immediately afterwards. Suzannah was shocked to receive a letter from a CPS lawyer in September 2013 which said: ‘I have taken into account all the surrounding circumstances, including the exchange of text messages between you before and after the incident. ‘I have also considered your account of the incident, particularly bearing in mind the type of underwear that you had on at the time,’ the letter added. ‘I was wearing Spanx control pants,’  Suzanne said. ‘They were about this big.’ She measures out a foot with her hands. ‘I don’t know what he was thinking.’ Horrific: Despite a rise in the number of rapes reported, the number of police referrals to prosecutors and convictions are dropping . She appealed the decision and a CPS prosecutions manager told her that the decision not to prosecute had been correct for a variety of reasons, but admitted that the previous lawyer ‘made an unnecessary reference' to the underwear, which had no relevance to the investigation. The recent figures, released to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism by the CPS, show that last year there were 1,747 fewer rape cases sent to the CPS by the police than in 2010, while the number of rape convictions fell from 2,433 to 2,300. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said there were worrying variations in the way rape cases are dealt with across the country. Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, says there are guidelines for police and prosecutors that are not being followed correctly . ‘We have certainly seen some indication that cases which we thought should have gone through (to charge) didn’t go through,’ she said. She added: ‘There is best practice out there. It’s just that not everyone is doing it.’ The fall in prosecutions took place despite a ‘Rape Scrutiny Panel’ that was set up last year by the CPS and police chiefs to advise police and prosecutors. Marianne Hester, professor of gender and violence at Bristol University, said there is an abiding impression that those reporting attacks ‘are just making it up’. She said: ‘Most cases do not end up in court, and this is not because the rape did not happen but because the police may not be vigorous enough in pursuing evidence, or because victims may be deemed too fragile to cope in the court setting or because they are seen as the 'wrong' kind of victim if they have been raped before.’ Mary Mason, director of Solace Woman’s Aid, added: ‘We will not see convictions improve significantly and consistently until there is a change to the institutional mindset which blames the victim for being raped.’ Academic research has shown that just 12 per cent of rapes recorded by police result in a conviction of any kind – and only around six per cent end in a conviction. It is believed that part of the problem is the guidelines produced by the Rape Scrutiny Panel have been interpreted differently by different police forces. Ms Saunders, who sits on the panel, said: ‘You have some places where within 24 hours of a rape being reported to the police there is a referral to the CPS. 'In others [the guidance] has been interpreted as “send the file through when we are ready for charging” – a much later stage.’ ‘The Rape Scrutiny Panel is now looking at how we get the numbers going through as well as the quality going up.' Rapist James Isted was sentenced to life imprisonment in February . The Metropolitan Police took no further action against a violent rapist despite having evidence connecting him to the crime. James Isted, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in February for two violent ‘stranger’ rapes, was arrested by police after his first attack in 2011, when a car spotted by the victim before the rape was linked to him. But he was released without charge due to a ‘lack of evidence’ after the victim, a teenage girl, was unable to identify him. He went on to rape a second woman in May 2013 in the same location as the first – a graveyard in Orpington, Kent. The Bureau can reveal that Isted stole the teenager’s phone after the first attack. Detectives seized several phones from Isted after his arrest failed to check whether the victim’s phone was amongst them. When officers eventually realised the victim’s phone had been in Isted’s possession they compounded their error by failing to re-arrest him, leaving him free to re-offend. A probation officer, who interviewed Isted after he was convicted, wrote: ‘Emboldened by the fact the police did not charge him for the first offence he carried out the second offence, believing he would not be detected’ The Met apologised to the second victim, admitting that mistakes were made. A spokeswoman for the force said: ‘We voluntarily referred the matter to the IPCC who took the decision to return it to the MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] to be looked at locally. That investigation, by officers from our Directorate of Professional Standards, is ongoing and it would therefore be inappropriate to discuss further at this time.’ Source: Bureau of Investigative Journalism .","Victim says she was told her underwear was a factor in case being dropped .

"By . Glen Owen . Nigel Farage yesterday effectively ruled out a pact with the Conservatives as he battled to stop the ‘sluts’ row from completely overshadowing his annual party conference. The UKIP leader tried to move on from the furore over MEP Godfrey Bloom’s ourburst by outlining his determination  to remain independent. But his efforts were undermined when The Mail on Sunday established that  Mr Farage shares a Brussels flat with Mr Bloom. UKIP leader Nigel Farage will continue to share a flat with Mr Bloom in Brussels - even though he has suspended him from the party . The two men have claimed more than £100,000 in expenses on the property since 2009. A spokesman for Mr Farage said he would continue to share the flat with Mr Bloom – in which Mr Farage ‘agreed to take the smaller room’ – even though he has suspended  Mr Bloom from the party. Asked whether Mr Farage would kick Mr Bloom out of the flat, a UKIP spokesman said: ‘No. Nigel and Godfrey go back a very long way.’ He did not say whether either man cleaned behind the fridge. Mr Farage said it was ‘extremely unlikely’ UKIP would form an electoral pact with the Tories. He said: ‘We’re our own party with our own agenda.’ UKIP found itself at the centre of a political storm after Mr Bloom called a group of women ‘sluts’ and hitting a journalist over the head. Mr Farage said his former flatmate had ‘destroyed’ Ukip’s annual conference – where he told activists they could hold the balance of power at Westminster after the next election. A media scrum formed around Mr Bloom as the row erupted over his comments about women at a UKIP event . The UKIP leadership are furious that Mr . Bloom's antics have distracted from the launch of its drive to win next . year's European elections . Mr Bloom, whose track record of outbursts includes comments about Britain giving  foreign aid to ‘Bongo Bongo land’, was hosting a conference fringe meeting to promote ‘Women in Politics’. The event was attended by a number of prominent activists, including Mr Farage’s wife Kirsten. When one female Ukip activist joked that she did not have time to ‘clean behind the fridge’ – a reference to Mr Bloom’s claim that women should spend more time cleaning – Mr Bloom turned to his wife and said: ‘Don’t listen to this, dear.’ After a second woman then made the same joke, Mr Bloom declared loudly: ‘The room is full of sluts!’ Minutes later he launched into a rant outside, which ended with him hitting Channel Four News reporter Michael Crick over the head with a copy of the Ukip conference programme. An unrepentant Mr Bloom, who later delivered his conference speech on defence policy, said he had made a ‘purposely outrageous joke among friends which was taken as joke by women present’. He said he had used the term in its old-fashioned sense of a slattern – a dirty or untidy woman – rather than its modern reference to promiscuity. It comes barely a month after Mr Bloom's complaint that UK aid money was being sent to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’. In the wake of the latest outburst, Mr Farage told Sky News: 'My opinion is Godfrey has gone beyond the pale. 'He's a friend of mine and I'm sorry to say it but he has gone beyond the pale and I think we have no option but to remove the whip from him. Personally I have had enough of it.' To add to the embarrassment an article emerged from 2006 in which Mr Bloom confessed to visiting brothels and said most prostitutes 'do it because they want to'. Challenged by reporters outside the event, Mr Bloom defended the extraordinary remark: ‘I made a joke and said “oh well you're all sluts” and everybody laughed and all the women laughed. ‘Was there a single women in there who didn't laugh at the joke?,' he told Sky News. He then called Sky News reporter Darren McCaffrey a ‘sad little man’. As he made his way down the street in Westminster, Mr Bloom was then accosted by Michael Crick from Channel 4 News about the fact that a party brochure featured only white faces. He replied: ‘What a racist comment. How dare you, that's an appalling thing to say, you're picking people out for the colour of their skin? You disgust me.’He then took the brochure and hit Mr Crick over the head with it. He later wrote on Twitter: 'It shd not b [sic] taken out of context & misrepresented by a hostile press. 'Made a purposely outrageous joke among friends which was taken as joke by women present.' The bizarre behaviour overshadowed the UKIP conference, where Mr Farage tried to play down the idea that the party was damaged by outbursts by senior figures. He accused Mr Bloom of 'destroying' the conference and that could not be tolerated.","Nigel Farage has tried to move on from the furore over Godfrey Bloom’s ourburst .

"By . Jason Groves, Chief Political Correspondent . Accusation: Former teachers said Mr Farage was 'a fascist' and 'a racist' when he attended Dulwich College . Nigel Farage was last night accused of having been a racist when he was a schoolboy. The claim came as he prepared to tell his party that leaving the European Union was the ‘only way’ to deal with the pressures of immigration. On the eve of the UK Independence Party’s conference today, Channel Four News broadcast comments from teachers at Dulwich College that the teenage Farage was a ‘fascist’ and a ‘racist’ when a pupil at the private London school in the late 1970s and early 1980s. A letter from 1981 claims Mr Farage, now 49, was even heard ‘shouting Hitler Youth songs’. The claims did not prevent him being appointed as a prefect at the school. The Ukip leader last night played down the significance of the claims, which he said were made by left-wing teachers who disliked his views. He denied singing Nazi songs. Mr Farage said: ‘Yes of course I said some ridiculous things, not necessarily racist things. It depends how you define it. ‘You’ve got to remember that ever since 1968 up until the last couple of years, we’ve not been able in this country, intelligently to discuss immigration, to discuss integration, it’s all been a buried subject.’ He added: ‘Was I a difficult, bolshie teenager who pushed the boundaries of debate further than I should? Yes. Have I ever been a member  of an extremist organisation? No, I have not.’ Mr Farage was backed last night by a former Dulwich College master Terry Walsh, who said the complaints  were ‘probably a reflection on the staff, not on him – there was quite a strong left-wing element’. Mr Farage will attempt to put the claims behind him when he addresses his party’s conference in London. He will tell activists Ukip is poised to cause a political ‘earthquake’ if it can top the poll in next year’s European Parliament elections. Education: Mr Farage attended Dulwich College, a private school in south-east London . And he will urge the party to put the issue of immigration from the EU at the heart of its campaign – and use it  to press the Government to block the free access of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria, due to start at the beginning of next year. ‘That is my challenge to them. If they ignore it we must turn the euro elections into the referendum that we have not been given,’ he will say. He will insist Ukip is not against all immigration, but that ‘sheer weight of numbers’ is putting too much strain on public services and driving down wages for the low-skilled. Immigration from Bulgaria and Romania will also see crime gangs flooding in to Britain, he will add.But he will say the main parties are powerless to deal with the issue as clamping down on EU immigration is against Brussels rules.","Teachers who knew Farage as a pupil said he was 'a facist' and 'a racist'

"By . Samantha Brick . The kicking usually starts before the plane has started taxi-ing for take-off. A continual jabbing in the small of one's back that jars and shakes your seat with increasing ferocity, all delivered by a pair of size 2, Velcro-strapped sandals on the end of some excited, feral child's legs. It's unbearably irritating and usually a sharp word to the children and a plaintive appeal to the parents yields a minute or two of peace before the whole ghastly business starts again. But turning around during a recent flight to the UK from my home in South-West France, to admonish the children showering me with sweet wrappers, I was shocked to find the parents nowhere to be seen. Scroll down for video . Terror in the air: Sitting near a naughty child can be a nightmare (posed by models) Two under-fives had been left to sit alone throughout the 90-minute flight, not because there were no seats available, but because their parents simply couldn't be bothered to look after them, and thought they deserved a bit of 'me' time. They'd deliberately positioned themselves several rows behind their fractious offspring. Occasionally, the mother lifted her head from her novel and plastic glass of Chardonnay to call to her children at the front to 'behave themselves' - which, believe me, they had no intention of doing - while their father slept soundly on. And I'm afraid to say this wasn't a one-off. As a frequent flyer (my freelance work brings me to the UK several times a month), and also a childless one, I've found parents are frequently abusing the online seat booking facilities on budget airlines to position themselves as far away from their appallingly behaved children as possible, using fellow passengers as free childcare. It's selfish, ill-mannered and confirms my belief that not only are British children the worst behaved in Europe, their parents are just as bad. You probably assume that because I don't have children I can't possibly understand the stress of travelling with them. To which I'd reply this: I'm an adult. If I had them, I'd take responsibility for them. I certainly wouldn't travel with more children than I have hands, either - how do you control them otherwise? Last week I paid £400 for my flight to the Midlands to attend the funeral of my grandmother, who died in July, two days before her 90th birthday. Naturally, at the height of the holiday season, the airport, close to my home in the heart of the Dordogne, was awash with middle-class parents returning to Britain after their holidays. They all looked tanned, relaxed and heartily sick to the back teeth of their spoilt, whiny offspring after a fortnight spent entertaining them. On reflection, the signs that the flight wasn't going to go to plan were all there. There were children left in control of luggage trolleys, crashing into anyone who wouldn't move out of their way quickly enough. Then school-aged children refusing to use the loos without their mother in the cubicle to wipe down the seat first (yes, really). Then there was the endless whinnying at the check-in desk because they couldn't take their bottle of Perrier water through to the departure lounge. Samantha thinks British mothers should discipline their children instead of overindulging them . That day, I deliberately hadn't flown with one of the bargain basement airlines that frequent this airport. Indeed I had hoped for a calm uneventful flight in order to compose myself and polish the eulogy I was due to present the following day. Sadly, it wasn't to be. 'Daddy's tired and Mummy wants to finish her book, so we're sitting over there,' a well-dressed, tanned woman hissed at her children after boarding the plane. Then, she thrust a packet of sweets into each of their sweaty little hands before taking her husband's arms and fleeing to their seats several rows behind. Had an emergency occurred on the plane, I would have been closer to this woman's children than she was. Had this prospect so much as even crossed their minds? I very much doubt it. Needless to say, high on sugar, and even before the flight took off, the little darlings started. They bickered and antagonised each other before exchanging a series of kicks and punches. For the next 90 minutes I had to listen to their mother use me as an excuse for them to behave themselves: 'The lady will shout at you if you keep chucking your sweet wrappers at her.' No, this 'lady' didn't. But given that the mother's admonishments were barked out from the middle of the plane where her children could barely hear her, they ignored her for most of the flight, while I endured an hour-and-a-half of hell. I used to despise middle-class mothers for hoiking passengers out of their seats if they couldn't sit next to their brood on crowded aircraft. But little could I have imagined that one day they would wise up to the fact that no one can actually stop them dumping their fractious ill-behaved children anywhere on a plane - and hang the fact that their fellow passengers might be desperate for a bit of peace and quiet. Granted, I'm not a parent, but I am a stepmother and my stepchildren, although now grown up, have always behaved impeccably whenever we have travelled. I wouldn't expect anything less and nor would their father, my husband Pascal. Children slot into the family here in France - they do not take on a role akin to that of a hallowed saint. The sense of entitlement evident in British children, bred into them by their mothers, is staggering and it's getting worse. Other friends who don't have children are gobsmacked by mothers who time and again allow their children to redefine the meaning of hooligan. Check in and chill out: Many parents are deliberately choosing to sit away from their children on flights for some 'me time' (posed by models) Fifty-three per cent of British adults say they would support child-free flights . One girlfriend's husband, a successful businessman who regularly travels the globe, had to hold onto one toddler's arm for the complete journey from London to Toulouse recently because he was running riot in the aisle while his mother, seemingly oblivious to the havoc he was causing, chattered non-stop to a fellow passenger. My friend's husband didn't need to speak to the child to know that the little monster was British. He knows, as well as I, and countless other passengers like us, that such behaviour simply wouldn't occur within families from elsewhere in the world. You might argue that this isn't anything new. Global stars and musicians have, for decades, flown first class, while their children fly in economy. But there is a difference: they are usually flying with a nanny or other responsible adult who supervises their behaviour and attends to their needs throughout the flight. Today, I'd happily pay an additional fee if I could guarantee a seat in a child-free zone of a plane. Meanwhile, I would urge airline bosses to make a rule that children are not allowed to travel without one or other of their parents at their side.","As a frequent flyer, I've seen many appalling behaved children on flights .

"By . Sophie Borland And James Chapman . Betrayal: Amie Miller died after basic checks were not made . Hospitals where hundreds of patients were dying needlessly received elite status under a flagship Labour policy, it emerged yesterday. Six failing NHS trusts were rewarded even though their death rates had been persistently high for years. The trusts, which include Basildon and Thurrock, Burton, Medway, Northern Lincolnshire and Goole, Sherwood Forest, and Tameside, were placed in special measures this summer after a major investigation exposed appalling levels of care. Yesterday the Health Secretary announced plans to effectively strip them of the coveted ‘foundation trust’ status, endowed by Labour, which enables bosses to set their own pay and build wards and departments without prior Whitehall approval. Jeremy Hunt also accused Labour of making ‘big mistakes’ over the policy and ‘waving through’ hospitals as elite even though patients were dying as a result of poor care. He promised to overhaul the scheme by ensuring only hospitals with care rated as good or outstanding would qualify. Foundation trusts were introduced by former Labour health secretary Alan  Milburn in 2002 to give the best-performing hospitals more independence. In all, 88 of the 147 hospital trusts in  England have gained the status after applying to the Care Quality Commission and the NHS Trust Development Authority watchdogs, which check their finances and standard of care. But yesterday Mr Hunt warned that the independence earned from being a foundation trust ‘had done more harm than good’ for some. He also said officials granting the status had been too focused on finances rather than care. This led to hospital managers cutting frontline staff and jeopardising patient safety just to ensure they balanced the books before applying. This is how the Mail highlighted the case of Amie Miller, a 15-year-old from Thurrock, who died after doctors failed to carry out basic checks . Figures analysed by Professor Sir Brian Jarman, an expert on hospital performance at Imperial College London, show that the death rates for five of the six trusts were higher than expected when they were granted foundation trust status. Only Medway NHS trust in Kent recorded rates that were lower than expected, but there are doubts over the accuracy of its figures. The worst was Basildon and Thurrock, in Essex, where death rates were 20 per cent higher than they should have been when the trust earned foundation status. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has accused Labour of 'waving through' hospitals as elite even though patients were dying as a result of poor care . Yesterday, the Mail highlighted the case of Amie Miller, a 15-year-old from Thurrock who died of a brain injury at Basildon Hospital. Doctors failed to carry out basic tests that could have saved her life when she was admitted with migraine symptoms in 2008. She was also given the wrong medication, which may have worsened her condition. Doctors did not give her an MRI scan, despite one being recommended, and the results of a CT scan were misinterpreted. In a damning verdict, an inquest jury this week said staff had missed a string of opportunities to save Miss Miller’s life. Hospital care came under scrutiny after a damning report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal, where hundreds died from neglect. Since then another 11 trusts – including the six foundation trusts – have been singled out for their high death rates and poor levels of care. And later this month another major inquiry will look into the needless deaths of mothers and babies at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Trust, in Cumbria. Mr Hunt said: ‘Through the horrors of Mid-Staffs and Morecambe Bay, it’s become clear that Labour made big mistakes in the way they implemented their flagship foundation trust initiative. We back foundation trusts and think they are key to raising NHS standards, but it’s unacceptable that hospitals with persistently high death rates were given this elite status.’ He said poor scrutiny by the Care Quality Commission watchdog was partly to blame, adding: ‘Management failed but still kept their independence because the quality watchdog was not fit for purpose.’ He announced plans for managers from top performing trusts to be sent in to those in special measures to help turn them around. But Labour health spokesman Andrew Gwynne said: ‘Reports revealed that these hospitals have deteriorated and lost staff under David Cameron. Ministers shouldn’t try to pass the buck.’","Foundation trusts were introduced by .

"By . James Chapman . Toxic: Damian McBride (right) confesses to helping Gordon Brown drive his leading rivals out of the Cabinet by using the dark arts of media manipulation . The toxic culture of spin, smears and feuding at the heart of New Labour is laid bare today in an explosive political memoir. Damian McBride confesses to helping Gordon Brown drive his leading rivals out of the Cabinet by using the dark arts of media manipulation. In the disturbingly candid book, serialised in the Daily Mail, the spin doctor says he routinely discredited opponents by tipping off newspapers about ‘drug use, spousal abuse, alcoholism and extra-marital affairs’. Coming from a figure so central to Mr Brown’s political operation, the book will hugely embarrass Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, the former prime minister’s two closest allies. The pair were in constant contact with Mr McBride, raising urgent questions over what they knew of his brutal tactics. The memoir will send shockwaves through the Labour party ahead of next week’s annual conference. The key revelations it contains include: . Mr McBride was forced to resign as Mr Brown’s special adviser in 2009 after he was linked to a plot to smear Tory MPs via an anti-Conservative gossip website. The emails included fabricated slurs about the politicians’ health and private lives. His book Power Trip, which will be published next week, tells the inside story of his own downfall, which plunged Mr Brown’s Downing Street into scandal and chaos from which it never recovered. It gives the inside track of the years of bitter infighting between Mr Brown and Tony Blair, the spinning and plotting that ended the careers of senior ministers and the banking collapse that came close to plunging Britain into anarchy. Many of the key figures in his story are still leading lights in Westminster, which he brands ‘the binge drinking capital of Britain’. Mr McBride confesses that he was ‘sucked in like a concubine at a Roman orgy’ to the ‘dark’ world of politics, which he says encourages ‘vanity, duplicity, greed, hypocrisy and cruelty’. Spin: Gordon Brown attending the Labour Party Conference in Manchester in 2009 with Damian McBride (left) ‘Some people will undoubtedly wonder why – if Gordon knew I was guilty of misbehaviour – he never either formally reined me in or had me moved on,’ he writes. ‘And my answer to that is simply that there was something unspoken between us ... the unspoken word was from me to him, and said: “Don’t question my methods”.’ He gives extraordinary accounts of his role in trashing both Mr Clarke and John, now Lord, Reid, as they emerged as rivals to Mr Brown in the bitter battle to succeed Mr Blair. McBride gives an extraordinary account of his role in trashing both Mr Clarke and Lord John Reid as they emerged as rivals to Mr Brown . In 2005, when Mr Clarke was Home Secretary and a threat to Mr Brown’s succession, Mr McBride manufactured what looked like a briefing war between him and Mr Blair’s anti-social behaviour ‘czar’ Louise Casey. Newspapers were duped into thinking the pair were bitter rivals over home affairs policy – and the apparent feud contributed to Mr Blair sacking Mr Clarke in 2006. Mr McBride later told journalists Mr Blair had been in tears as he dismissed him. He also confesses to helping to destroy Lord Reid, who was the one remaining ‘obstacle’ when Mr Brown finally had the chance to run for the leadership. Mr McBride says he started to leak from a ‘black book’ of stories he had gathered about Lord Reid’s alleged escapades in the 1980s and 1990s, when he and Mr Brown were both in the Commons. Mr McBride does not disclose details of the dangerous gossip he had assembled but one story published at the time included lurid allegations of ‘drink-fuelled indecent proposals’ he allegedly made to one of Mr Brown’s closest allies, Dawn Primarolo, now deputy Speaker of the Commons. Lord Reid was alleged to have asked Miss Primarolo to go to bed with him during a parliamentary trip to Berlin in the late 1980s and later told her at a bar in the Commons: ‘I want sex with you.’ Married Miss Primarolo was said to have been outraged and told him to stop pestering her. Circulation of the story was said to have been key to his decision to pull out of the Labour leadership contest and announce his resignation from the Cabinet. ‘No sooner had the first call been made following the first story I’d given out, than Reid announced he would be resigning,’ McBride says. A friend of Lord Reid later told Mr McBride he could ‘call off the dogs now’. The book will hugely embarrass Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, the former prime minister’s two closest allies . The book goes on to reveal that while he remained publicly neutral in the Labour leadership contest that followed his defeat in the 2010 election, Mr Brown privately backed Ed Miliband. He was determined to prevent David Miliband, an arch-Blairite, winning the race and taking the party down routes he had resisted for a decade. Despite his closeness to Mr Balls, another candidate, he decided to back Ed – and intervened late in the contest when he feared David might win. Mr McBride says Mr Brown marked out Ed Miliband as ‘the one to watch’ in 2007.","Damian McBride helped drive Gordon Brown's rivals out of Cabinet .

"By . Anna Edwards . Details of Syria's chemical weapons stash have finally been handed over to an international watchdog - but have not yet been shared with other countries. Syrian president Bashar Assad has agreed to surrender his arsenal under a deal brokered by Russia to stave off threatened US-led military strikes in retaliation for his use of the sarin nerve agent. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed it had received the 'expected disclosure' from the Syrians and was 'currently reviewing the information'. Free Syrian Army fighters run for cover from snipers on the front line in Aleppo's Sheikh Saeed neighbourhood today . Free Syrian Army fighters continue to fight government troops, as authorities hand over details of the country's chemical weapons stash . As the authorities hand over the information in a deal hammered out by Russia and America, Syrian government troops backed by allied militiamen have stormed a village in the centre of the country, killing at least 15 people, an activist group said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack on the predominantly-Sunni village of Sheik Hadid occurred late yesterday. The group said the dead included two women and a child. The rest were men but it is not known if they included rebel fighters. The assault came shortly after rebels captured Jalma, another village close to Sheik Hadid in Hama province, killing five soldiers. Syrian president Bashar Assad has agreed to surrender his arsenal after the US threatened military strikes following a chemical weapons attack on civilians . The Observatory said fighting was raging today in Sheik Hadid and nearby areas. The information will not yet be shared with OPCW member states, such as the UK, because a new process has to be agreed over the coming days as Syria is not signed up to the chemical weapons convention. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Syria is a unique case. It has made this disclosure as a non-state party. The coming OPCW executive council needs to endorse a new process to handle Syria's chemical weapons. 'Once this has been achieved, the OPCW will be in a position to make the Syrian disclosure available to states' parties.' Russia staved off the threat of a US-led military strike against Syria in retaliation for Assad's use of the sarin nerve agent . Once the information is released to the UK, the spokesman said: 'In consultation with partners we will reach a judgment on its credibility. This is only the start of a long and complex process.' The development came as David Cameron sought to build pressure on international leaders to do more to help alleviate the suffering of Syrians caught up in the bloody conflict ahead of the United Nations general assembly (UNGA) meeting. In a round of telephone diplomacy, Mr Cameron has spoken to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Khalifa Al Thani. Mr Cameron has also written personal letters to the leaders of France, Sweden, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia focused on the specific contributions they could make. In the letters, Mr Cameron said: 'The forthcoming meeting in New York of the UN general assembly offers a strong platform to step up international action to help the innocent victims of conflict and I hope we can work together to encourage others to contribute more to the UN consolidated appeal which is significantly underfunded. 'It is equally vital that this aid reaches those who need it most. This is proving extremely difficult in Syria, in part because of the security situation, but also because of various bureaucratic obstacles. 'We are calling on all actors, inside and outside Syria, to implement the practical actions set out by (UN emergency relief co-ordinator) Baroness Amos for improving humanitarian access. 'I hope you can use your influence with the parties and your national address at UNGA to underline the urgency of improved access, and to urge the parties to act immediately to ensure assistance can reach those in need.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will lead the UK delegation to UNGA and will attend a UN-led meeting on the humanitarian situation in Syria, accompanied by International Development Secretary Justine Greening.","Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has received details .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Graphic details: Briana Holland, 22, has admitted to giving birth at work then dumping the newborn boy gagged with a tampon applicator and bound with toilet paper in a garbage can, expecting him to die . An Indianapolis woman has admitted to giving birth in a restroom then dumping the newborn boy gagged and bound with toilet paper in a garbage can, expecting him to die. A judge entered a preliminary not guilty plea Wednesday for 22-year-old Briana Holland on charges including attempted murder and child neglect. Police arrested Holland after her co-workers at an Indianapolis warehouse found the newborn Friday night. Court documents say the baby's head was covered in a bag, part of a tampon applicator was shoved inside his mouth and toilet paper was wrapped 15 times around his neck. A police affidavit cited by Fox59 says Holland stated she was scared and could not afford to care for her son while attending college and holding down a job. The affidavit said when the detective asked Holland what she thought would happen to the baby she replied: ‘I know what the results would probably be. It would probably die.’ The baby, who is in the custody of child welfare officials, was purple, cold and gasping for air when the co-workers found in the trash can, court documents said. A maintenance worker at the industrial facility has been credited with saving the child's life. The station WANE reported that the . unnamed employee was alerted by a colleague to strange sounds coming . from a trash bin in a restroom. Heroic actions: The authorities were notified after staffer at United Technology Carrier Corporation raised the alarm; one of the workers used a shirt to keep the infant warm and stopped the bleeding from the umbilical cord with his hands . Upon discovering the source of the noise, the worker wrapped the baby's cold body in a shirt to keep him warm and stopped the bleeding from the umbilical cord with his bare hands. Doctors at Riley Hospital said the newborn could have bled to death or succumbed to hypothermia if it wasn't for the Good Samaritan’s efforts. Holland's boyfriend told police that she had kept her pregnancy secret from her family and hadn't received any prenatal care. He said he found out about her giving birth on Twitter and intends to seek custody of the child, the affidavit said. After being contacted by employees at . United Technology Carrier Corporation last Friday, police arrived to . find the newborn inside the company's bathroom trash can. Police recovered the baby at around 8pm that evening - thought to be only an hour after he was born. Holland . reportedly went right back to her work station after delivering her son . in the bathroom. She was arrested by detectives at 5am the following . morning and taken away for processing. The 22-year-old's twin sister and father also work at the warehouse, but she did not got to them for help when she went into labor. Holland also did not seek assistance from a medical station located at the site. Unexpected find: Police at the United Technology Carrier Corporation facility on Friday evening where the boy was found with toilet paper wrapped 15 times around his neck . Although the yet-to-be-named newborn weighing 7.9lbs and measuring 20.1 inches in length was taken to Riley Hospital for Children in a critical condition, his health has since improved and he is in the care of Department of Child Services staff. Indiana has . a safe haven law that allows people to give up custody of infants less . than 30 days old to a hospital emergency room, police or fire station.

Veena Iyer told Boca Raton officers she saw the boy, 1, and girl, 4, walking around Tuesday afternoon before she contacted authorities, according to an affidavit obtained by MailOnline. 'It should be noted this area is next to a public roadway,' the affidavit said. Arrested: Father Stanley Fitzpatrick, pictured, was arrested when his two children were found walking around near a dumpster without any supervision . Iyer told police the children took her to their family's home - but their parents were not there. 'They were in their pajamas, no shoes, nothing, seemed very tired and hungry,' Iyer told WPBF, who earlier reported on the case. 'I said, ""Who is watching you?"" and [the girl] said, ""Nobody."" I asked her, 'Where is your dad?' She said, ""I don’t know. He took my mom to work.""' Father Stanley Fitzpatrick, 41,  was eventually found by Boca Raton police officers and told them he took his wife to a bus stop before he stopped to talk with a friend, according to the affidavit. The children's mother told a WPBF crew of the situation 'It's not really that serious. 'The cameraman [is] supposed to come out if the child drowns, if the child was severe hurt. They were not hurt. They did not drown.' Scene: The children were found walking near the dumpster at Footprints Academy, pictured . The affidavit revealed the family's home was in 'substandard conditions.' '[Officers] observed moldy food in the refrigerator, the dishwasher left open with dishes and knives in it, and there were no locks on the cabinets,' it said. Officers also reportedly only found 4 diapers in the home and discovered the children slept on a mattress together on the floor. It also alleged that the 1-year-old boy 'had such bad diaper rash that he was flinching when officers changed his diaper.' Fitzpatrick was arrested on two counts of child neglect, police said. The Palm Beach Post reported he posted a $6,000 bond.","Veena Iyer discovered two children near a daycare center's dumpster on Tuesday .

"By . Ryan Lipman For Daily Mail Australia . Not many 42-year-old mothers can boast earning $390 for 15 minutes work while supporting a family. Former accountant Julie Fennell also known as Bella has been a professional fattogram stripper for four years. Currently weighing close to 140 kilograms, the resident of Swansea, south of Newcastle, has a 19-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son and said she absolutely loves her work. 'The best thing is when I do a live show and everyone is talking about me afterwards for weeks on end,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I love my job'. Scroll down for video . Julie Fennell was a former accountant but since becoming a fattogram stripper about four years ago, can now earn $390 for 15 minutes work . Julie is also known by her performance name Bella and her most popular fattogram stripper outfits include a policewoman and schoolgirl . Having completed more than 400 shows during her career regularly as a schoolgirl or policewoman, she often performs in the Newcastle area and travels to Sydney where she does up to four shows on a weekend in clubs, hotels penthouses and private residences. Bella said she took up fattogram stripping after a conversation with a friend. 'A friend of mine asked if I would be interested in doing it,' she said. 'I have small children so I thought I don't want to do anything that would jeopardise myself.' 'Taking the top part of my clothing off and getting paid $400 - I thought why not.' Shortly after the conversation she joined a stripping agency in the Newcastle area, which has since closed down but she now works for a few different agencies including Damien's Party Entertainment. Bella said she does not offer X-rated shows like traditional 'skinny' strippers, yet can still command $390 for a 15-minute show if she travels to Sydney. She is is also regularly part of radio promotions and competitions and photo shoots. During her career, the fattogram stripper has done more than 400 shows including bucks parties and 18th and 21st birthdays . The Swansea mother said her shows were not X-rated, although she foes take her top off . Bella does shows in the Newcastle area as well as travelling to Sydney for work, where she also does club performances . 'Skinny strippers have to do more than what I have to do for less money,' she said. 'I'm more of a novelty stripper and I can charge more because of it.' 'I come in, give them (clients) a bit of fun and I'm not so serious. Normal strippers won't let you take photos or take videos, but I let them take it all - I don't care. They say: ""Oh my God you're so cool"".' However Bella does perform topless and mixes her shows up by incorporating whips, chains and gag balls. 'I'm different to an everyday stripper,' she said and added her performances were in high demand. 'Most people forget a skinny stripper's name, but everyone remembers mine. People still talk about me for ages after they see me - and it's all good.' The mother-of-two said while performing she was focused on her work and making sure everyone has a good time. 'I go do my thing and then leave,' she said. 'Sometimes I'm asked to hang around and drink and party, but obviously I've got other shows to do... otherwise I'd love to party.' Earlier this year Bella was part of a KIIS FM radio promotion in Sydney with breakfast hosts Kyle and Jackie O, where callers had to correctly guess if the hosts were telling the truth about a fattogram . The mother-of-two performs at private houses parties, in hotel rooms and penthouses, cafes and clubs on weekends . Thanks to word of mouth, Bella said popularity for her shows was soaring and she has even had invites from cafes asking her to perform for an evening. 'I'm starting to get a good reputation of being a good performer,' she said. She regularly performs at buck nights, 18th and 21st birthday parties. 'Parents book me for birthday parties for something different,' Bella said. The most bizarre thing she has been asked to do was motorboat some women. 'They actually liked it, it was at their request,' she said. 'I've done a couple of lesbian parties - they loved me. I'm open to anything except bestiality,' she joked. While Bella said the feedback from her performances was overwhelming positive, there have been occasions when she has had to leave. Thanks to positive word of mouth, Bella said demand for her shows was booming . Bella said the feedback from customers was generally overwhelmingly positive. She is pictured left with Aaron Wheelz Fotheringham at a Nitro Circus show, and right she was taking part in a NXFM radio promotion dressed in costume as a policewoman . 'People have made me feel not the best and not showing them, I've walked out crying,' she said. 'Throwing full pizzas, lollies - it's degrading by throwing food at you.' Bella said out of 400 shows, only 10 have been a degrading experience, with the worst happening about three years ago. 'I quit (fattogram stripping) for a month... down at Terrigal I was trapped in a house,' she said. 'Food was thrown and a beer bottle at my head.' Bella said she eventually got out of the house after she broke down in tears and her clients let her go as a result. 'It (the bottle) cracked my head. They were jerks. I quit and then I thought down the track, if I quit and don't go back then they have won and I didn't think that was fair. I've been stronger then ever since.' The fattogram stripper said she has always been overweight and due to medication she takes for a bipolar disorder, this causes her to put on even more. 'I'm an emotional eater. If I'm happy or if I'm sad, I eat,' she said. The 42-year-old became a fattogram stripper after a friend suggested it and said it pays her bills and she loves it . Yet four years ago she had lap band surgery and lost about 130 kilograms - nearly half her body weight. 'I've still got a bit to go,' she said. 'I'm six foot two, so it hides quite well.' 'My health is not deteriorating and I'm pretty healthy so I'll keep going (stripping) until I can't anymore... the doctor is not worried about my heart so medically I'm fine to keep going.' 'Doing thee to four shows every weekend, you need to be a bit fit.' Two years ago she underwent another procedure to tighten the band and Bella said if she does this a second time, she could easily loose another 40 kilograms in a couple of months. While some my find her career choice unconventional, Bella said she had the support of her friends, family and even her children. 'My little boy is just finding out recently - I don't think he has a problem,' she said. 'My daughter comes with me to jobs and helps me carry my stuff.' 'My friends and family think I have guts to be doing what I do. My parents were a bit ""Oh my God"", at first. One of the agencies Bella works for also offers dwarf strippers and gorilla singing telegrams . 'It pays my bills, I get the children what they need and I'm not harming anyone.' Bella appears in Not Your Usual Strippers as part of Outsiders Week on The Feed, tonight 7.30pm on SBS 2. Presenter Jeanette Francis said her understanding of a fattogram before meeting Julie was similar to most people. 'The only thing I knew about fattograms was what the average person knows... they are a form of entertainment, hired for bucks and birthdays,' Ms Francis said. 'I think the most surprising part for me was just how much they enjoy their job most of the time,' she said and added that Julie was often 'pumped and psyched' before a show. She said she expected to the fattograms to have faced stronger criticism during their career, but learnt this was not the case. Bella pictured with her son Darien, 12 and her daughter 19-year-old Tahlia, who accompanies her to shows . 'I was pleasantry surprised at how well they (the shows) tend to go,' she said. Ms Francis said Julie also smashed all sterotypes associated with traditional strippers. 'She's not conventionally beautiful, she a much bigger woman, she couldn't be more different from a sexy stripper,' she said. The presenter added that Julie did have lots of energy and lots of sexual energy and said there could be a sexual and/or funny elements to her shows.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Police officers carrying out stop and search checks will be forced to wear body cameras, under radical plans set out by the Liberal Democrats today. Armed police and riot squads will also be forced to wear cameras to record their behaviour under the plan, Home Office minister Norman Baker announced. The proposal is designed to restore public confidence in the system amid concerns raised by the Home Secretary Theresa May that black and ethnic minorities are unfairly targeted by police officers. The Lib Dems also want to force police to get a judge’s permission before carrying out certain stop and searches. Black people in Britain are seven times more likely to be stopped and searched than white Britons . Under the current rules, a senior officer can authorise stop and searches in a certain area without any suspicion of wrongdoing – if they fear violence is about to erupt or that people are carrying weapons without good reason. But there has been widespread concern over the way these ‘Section 60’ powers are used. Black and Asian youths are significantly more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white Britons. Earlier this year, the Home Secretary Theresa May pledged to tighten rules on stop-and-search amid warnings that as many as 250,000 a year may have been illegal. Today, Mr Baker promised to go further. He said: ‘Far too many innocent people are subjected to stop-and-search, which is often based on crude stereotyping of minorities.’ He added: ‘Stop-and-search has led to tension, and it’s something that cannot be ignored.’ Lib Dem minister Norman Baker wants police making stop and searches to wear body cameras . The Lib Dems have pointed to figures showing black people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people. In some areas this rises to 29 times more likely, according to research released by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in November last year. Those from Asian or other ethnic minority groups were twice as likely to be stopped as white people; . In London, black people were nearly 7 times more likely to be stopped, mixed race people 2.6 times more likely and Asians and others twice as likely. The Lib Dems said body cameras would ‘help build confidence in the Police, and give the public the reassurance that both the Police and public’s actions will be recorded’. The Metropolitan Police is running a series of trials of body cameras. Senior officers believe footage of incidents of officers responding to life-threatening and other situations will show the force’s professionalism. They highlight the images caught by the public of armed officers overpowering the killers of drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich last year. The pilot scheme follows controversy over the death of Mark Duggan, 29, who was shot by Met marksmen in Tottenham in August 2011. Riots erupted in the area after the killing. Officers, including 999 response teams, in 10 London boroughs have been equipped with 500 small cameras as part of the trial. Firearms officers will also be testing the technology. Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe believes the use of cameras will help to fight crime, defuse violent situations, lead to speedier justice and make the force more accountable. A Met spokesman said: ‘Officers taking part have been given training and guidance about when cameras are to be used, which means they will routinely collect evidence in incidents such as domestic abuse and public order, but also for potentially contentious interactions such as the use of stop-and-search.’","Lib Dems unveil manifesto pledge to make police officers wear cameras .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A 15-year-old schoolgirl has been found safe and well by police after disappearing with a man twice her age. Rebecca McLean was last seen with Michael Britten in Ryde on the Isle of Wight on Saturday after travelling to the holiday island by ferry. The 33-year-old chef has been arrested on suspicion of child abduction. Scroll down for video . Missing: Rebecca McLean, 15, (left) has been found safe and well by police after disappearing to the Isle of Wight. Britten (right) has been arrested on suspicion of child abduction . A . spokesman for Hampshire Police said: 'We can confirm that missing . teenager Rebecca McLean, aged 15 years, from Southampton, has been found . safe and well. 'Rebecca was located on the Isle of Wight. A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of child abduction.' It is thought the pair, who are both from Southampton, met while Britten was lodging at the home of one of Rebecca’s family friends, Michele Allen. The teenager had been living at the flat for a few weeks when social services decided to move her to new accommodation several weeks ago. She was last seen by her family on Saturday morning before taking a ferry to the Isle of Wight with Britten, it is thought. Ms Allen said she knew the pair had run away when she went into Britten’s bedroom at the weekend and found all of his things were gone. ‘I first realised they had gone when I went into his room to ask for him to pay his rent for the month, which is £50 a week. ‘He would go to Tesco's to withdraw money to pay me but I need someone to live here because I cannot pay the bills on my own. 'I went in to get the money from him but all their stuff was gone from the room and I realised they had done a runner. Travel: Both Rebecca and Mr Britten are from Southampton, Hampshire, which has a direct ferry service to the Isle of Wight . ‘At first I phoned the police and then the social worker rang me up - she said “she's on the run with Michael”’ ‘I couldn't believe what they had done - it's so wrong and it's affected everyone close to them. ‘I told them it was wrong but they would deny anything was happening between them.’ Ms Allen, 51, added Britten had been quiet before Rebecca moved in but became more sociable. ‘She would spend her days living in the flat talking to Michael - they were always together. ‘He worked as a chef at Yates's bar in the town centre and moved in here about three months ago - he knew a friend of my son's. ‘There was nothing at all between them when Rebecca first moved in until about a week later. ‘I wasn't very happy about it and this is what I told the social worker - she had come up to our flat to try and take her back to her mum's for the time being. ‘I think when they realised Rebecca would have to move out they decided to run off together.’ ‘Before she moved in he never spoke to me and would just be in his room saying nothing. He liked his computer games and had a TV for it in his room. ‘We had an argument once and I told him “I took you in when you had nowhere to go” - and from then on he started being nice. Rebecca’s mother, Julie Middleditch, said she was relieved her daughter had been found safe after making an emotional plea for her to come home at the weekend. ‘I'm really happy she has been found - we were so worried because she was away from home. ‘We wanted her back as soon as possible and it is a big relief,’ she said.

"By . Martin Robinson . On trial: Andy Coulson faces court after being accused of perjury during the trial of former MSP . Andy Coulson is to go on trial after he was today accused of lying under oath during the court case of a Scottish socialist outed as a swinger. Coulson was editor of the News of the World in 2004 when the tabloid reported Tommy Sheridan had visited a sex club and cheated on his wife Gail. Sheridan - an MSP representing the Scottish Socialist Party at the time - was awarded £200,000 in defamation damages but ended up on trial for perjury and was found guilty in 2010. He was convicted and jailed for three years for lying under oath about visiting Cupid's swingers' club in Manchester and his sex life during his 2006 defamation case. Coulson gave evidence that led to Sheridan's conviction and told the court that he did not know about the hacking of phones by the News of the World. Coulson was formally charged with three counts of perjury at a hearing in Glasgow today. He did not appear in court. It is alleged that Coulson, 46, made false claims in December 2010 while under oath as a witness at the trial of Sheridan and his wife Gail. Mrs Sheridan was cleared. The indictment claims that he falsely said that he had not heard of convicted hacker Glenn Mulcaire and did not know that royal editor Clive Goodman made payments to him. It also alleged that Coulson said he was not aware of a culture of phone hacking at the News of the World, apart from a 'very unfortunate case' involving Goodman. According to the indictment, Coulson was in fact aware of a number of instances of phone hacking at the News of the World between April 1, 2002 and August 8, 2006 while he was editor and acting editor of the newspaper. Convicted: Tommy Sheridan was found guilty of perjury in 2010 in a case centred on a News of the World story that claimed he had visited a swingers club and cheated on his wife Gail, left . It also claims that between December 1, . 2002 and January 26, 2007, while editor and deputy editor of the . newspaper, Coulson understood that payments had been made to corrupt . police officers by Goodman. NOVEMBER 2004: Sheridan sues News of the World after it publishes series of stories alleging adultery and visits to a swingers' club. AUGUST 2006: Politician denies allegations in court and jury awards him £200,000 in damages against News Group Newspapers. OCTOBER 2006: His testimony seems to be blown apart after News of the World publishes secretly-recorded videotape in which Sheridan admits having visited sex club. DECEMBER 2007: Sheridan arrested as he leaves Edinburgh radio station and charged with perjury. FEBRUARY 2008: Gail Sheridan, who acted as supporting witness to her husband, also charged with perjury. OCTOBER 2010: Couple's perjury trial begins. DECEMBER 17: Gail Sheridan acquitted. DECEMBER 23: Tommy Sheridan convicted of perjury. JANUARY 26 2011: Sheridan jailed for three years. August 6 2014: Andy Coulson told he faces trial for perjury . The payments included £750 in or around December 2002, £1,000 in or around January 2003 and £1,000 in or around June 2005. These were made to procure a 'green book' or other similar directories containing information including telephone numbers relating to the Royal Family and their members of staff, the indictment states. During Sheridan's trial, where he defended himself, he had called Andy Coulson to give evidence. This is when he is alleged to have lied under oath about hacking. Sheridan - who previously served time as part of an anti-poll tax campaign and then over an anti-Trident protest at Faslane nuclear submarine base - maintained his innocence through the trial. He claimed he was the victim of a 'vendetta' by the police and a 'conspiracy' involving the News of the World and colleagues within the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP). The former SSP leader said 16 former allies were lying as part of a 'political civil war' when they told the High Court in Glasgow that he had admitted at a 2004 meeting having been to Cupid's swingers' club in Manchester. But the jury found him guilty of perjury during the 2006 civil defamation case and lying about having an affair with SSP member Katrine Trolle.

"By . Wills Robinson . A pensioner who was given an incorrect £80,000 energy bill from British Gas is celebrating victory after winning a 12-year legal battle against the energy giants. . Roger Patrick, 74, from Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire, was overcharged £35,000 for gas and electricity at a sports club he helped build and was taken to court five times over false readings. The grandfather-of-six claims he suffered a stroke as a result of stress brought on by the costly legal process, but says he is satisfied as the amount has now been written off. Victory: Roger Patrick, 74, from Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire, sought legal action  after he was taken to court five times over false readings . Mr Patrick helped build the Burton Park Country Club in Kettering, Northamptonshire, for local children and football clubs to enjoy in 1992. In 2000, British Gas changed the electric meter at the club and two years later he noticed his electricity charges seemed extortionately high. Between 1999 and 2014, he used £49,000 worth of electricity, but was charged £80,000. He was then hounded for payments, even though the amount was inaccurate. The company even went to court on five occasions seeking a warrant to have his supplies disconnected. After he refused to pay the entire fee, British Gas sent in debt recovery agents 2012. It prompted him to seek legal advice of his own, and after a lengthy dispute the difference was written off. False: The incorrect bills were based on electricity and gas used at the Burton Park Country Club, in Kettering, Northamptonshire, which Mr Patrick helped build for local children to use . Today Mr Patrick, said the court costs had exceeded the £80,000 bill he was contesting but declared: 'It was more a matter of principle.' He added: 'All I wanted to do was to say that I did not owe that sort of money. It has been very stressful but I am satisfied now in what I did. 'It is 12 years of hard work but it has all paid off and I just want other people to know they don’t have to roll over be bullied by these fat cats from huge companies. 'I have been to the magistrates about six times. I was determined not to pay the money. It is just wrong. That sort of money for a small club is ridiculous. 'I actually had to remortgage my house in order to keep in going for as long as I did. It was a matter of principle.' Victim: Mr Parker said he suffered a stroke due to the stress of the court proceedings . The father-of-three remained manager of Burton Park Country Club for nearly twenty years but said the court battle meant he had to close the club in 2010. It has now been taken on by new owners. Mr Patrick, who lives in Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire, with his wife of 49-years Catherine, 69, added: 'That club was my pride and joy, its costs me that as well. 'As well as the errors with the electricity they tried to charge me for units of gas that I had never used at the club. 'They went three years without visiting and just kept sending very high estimated bills. I was being charged for tens of thousands of units that I had never used.' Mr Patrick said he does not now intend to pursue British Gas in a civil case for damages due to the ill health he has suffered in the past two years. He had already made a partially successful complaint to the Ombudsman in 2011 but he said British Gas 'had not done everything he had asked.' He added: 'The Ombudsman never really understood. He made a partially helpful decision in November 2011, but even then British Gas did not do all that he had asked.' Kevin Rogers, from Wilson Browne Solicitors, who began representing Mr Patrick in 2012, said: 'Mr Patrick is a pillar of the local community. 'He has been a fantastic supporter of grass roots football and social activities for decades. We advised that on this occasion actual legal proceedings against British Gas should be seen as a costly last resort. 'That being said, it took a year of patient negotiation to finally get the case in to the right hands within British Gas.' Tim Cowen of British Gas Business said: 'We apologise for the prolonged difficulties that Mr Patrick has faced with his energy bills, as we make every effort to resolve complaints swiftly for our customers. Extortionate: He was overcharged by £35,000 at Burton Park Country Club, an amount that was written off during the dispute . 'In this case there were a number of issues on his account dating back to 1999, which resulted in estimated or incorrect bills. 'We worked to resolve this, but were unable for a number of years to access the property to read the gas and electricity meters. 'We take the outcome of any ombudsman complaint very seriously and implemented all remedies in 2011 to help reduce Mr Patrick’s bill. 'We have now put in place a suitable payment arrangement with the current account holder for Burton Park Wanderers F.C and agreed to write off the remaining balance left for Mr Patrick to pay as a gesture of goodwill in recognition of his circumstances.'","Roger Patrick, 74, took energy giants to court after five court appearances .

"By . Wills Robinson . David McCormack, 63, failed two breath tests within hours of each other after he was stopped by police in South Shields, Tyne and Wear . A man caught drink driving was arrested for the same offence just hours later after he returned to a police station to collect his belongings - still drunk from the night before. Daniel McCormack, 63, was stopped in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, after officers were alerted to his ‘erratic driving’ and pulled him over. He recorded a reading of 372 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 milliletres of blood - more than four times the legal limit. After being released from South Shields Police Station, he drove back the next morning to collect his possessions where suspicious officers performed another breath test. The reading revealed McCormack was more than two times over the limit, and he was arrested again. He was banned from the roads for three years after he admitted two counts of driving with excess alcohol at South Tyneside Magistrates Court. Sarah Guest, prosecuting, said: 'He was seen by police driving erratically. They see the vehicle and ask the driver to stop. 'Another vehicle stops behind, and says he has been driving like that for a while. 'The following day, a police officer on duty at South Shields Police Station saw the defendant in the station, and noted he smelt strongly of alcohol. 'He was seen getting into his Ford Focus car in the car and drove at a slow speed. He was stopped at that point and given a roadside breath test.

Carole Whittingham, Secretary of the Campaign Against Drinking And Driving, says she is unsure What it will take’ for magistrates to exercise their powers to jail drink drivers. She said: 'This is a very high reading. Anybody who is over the drink and drive limit is a danger. 'What do you have to do for magistrates to use their power to jail offenders for up to six months?' He was released from the cells at South Shields Police Station in Tyne and Wear - but drove back a short time later to pick up his belongings and was arrested again by a suspicious police officer .","Daniel McCormack, 63, was stopped in South Shields, Tyne and Wear .

"By . Amanda Williams . A sea of foam has covered a coastal town in a white blanket of bubbles whipped up by huge waves. As scattered wind, rain and floods hit the rest of the country, the seaside town of Cleveleys, in Lancashire, has been overtaken by the snow-like covering. It comes as Met Office forecasters predict an unsettled week of sunshine and showers as the remnants of Hurricane Bertha head north, for Scotland.

"By . Alex Finnis . An Italian judge will decide who are the legal parents of IVF twins whose embryo was implanted into the wrong mother, a Rome court heard today. In a case which has gripped the country, two couples are fighting for the custody of the babies born on Sunday, whose fertilised embryos were mixed up in a Rome hospital. The devastating error was only discovered when the woman, who has not been named, was three months pregnant, and she decided to keep the babies. Two couples are fighting over who are the parents of twins after a mix-up in a Rome hospital led to a woman being implanted with another couple's embryo via IVF . The genetic mother of the twins also became pregnant shortly after, but tragically miscarried early on, and the fate of her children is now out of her hands. Legally she and her partner have no claim to the unborn children, as Italian law specifies that the mother is the woman who gives birth to the baby, but it is possible the judge may make an exception in this case. Judge Silvia Albano told an hour-long hearing  that he needed more time to consider whether the biological parents had the right to demand custody of the children. Italian law states that the mother is the woman who gives birth to the child, but Judge Silvia Albano told a court that he may make an exception in this case . The two disputing families have very similar names, sharing five of seven letters, according to Italian newspaper La Repubblica, which could be the reason for the mix-up. Despite deciding to take the pregnancy to term, the couple still intend to sue and file charges against the hospital, their lawyer Michele Ambrosini said. When the babies were born, the biological parents said they were 'happy that everything went well' even though 'we did not have the pleasure of holding our newborns in our arms'. But the other couple told the daily La Stampa: 'We feel their pain and we are also suffering. We suggested that we all meet but they have never come back to us.' The woman who gave birth said in April on hearing that the babies were not hers: ‘I had a moment of human rejection when I knew that they were not mine, or rather ours, that the embryos that I was carrying were of another woman, but then we decided that the pregnancy had to continue, our values are these. ‘These children live inside me. I heard them beat on my heart. They grow and are healthy,’ she told her lawyer. ‘How can I decide the fate of two creatures so long-awaited?’ The couples were among four prospective parents receiving fertility treatment at the same specialist unit of a Rome hospital on the same day last December. At the time, the error led the hospital to halt all embryo implantations. IVF, or in vitro fertilisation, literally means fertilisation in glass, and is used when a woman is struggling to conceive naturally and when other methods of assisted reproductive technology have failed. A woman's eggs are taken from her ovaries, and sperm are taken from a man, and they are introduced to each other via fluid in a laboratory. The eggs are fertilised. Laboratories are able to examine embryos to decipher which are the strongest and most likely to bear a child. Once fertilised, the embryo is then reinserted back into the woman's uterus, as continues to grow as normal. The process does not always work, in fact, the chances are roughly 50/50, depending on the age of the woman. A woman under the age of 35 has around a 48 per cent chance of getting pregnant through IVF, while that falls to 20 per cent for a 42-year-old. The first successful birth of a 'test tube baby' occurred in 1978, and created a woman called Louise Brown.","Woman implanted with wrong embryo in Rome hospital mix-up .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A rising number of childless couples who are struggling to conceive naturally are launching crowdfunding campaigns in hopes of raising money for expensive fertility treatments; from family, friends, and strangers alike. Dierdre Alby, a 40-year-old marketing director, and her 34-year-old husband Harold, who live in New York, have been struggling with infertility for two years and are aiming to drum up $32,000 from their GoFundMe campaign, to pay for a 'last hope' IVF session in hopes of achieving their baby dream. 'Any donation level is welcome... even if you only have $5 to donate we will be thrilled!' the couple write on their page, which has so far raised $3,664. 'If you do have the financial freedom, please consider a donation of $100 - if we can get 300 people to give this amount we will be able to have our child!' Appeal: Dierdre Alby, a 40-year-old marketing director (right) and her 34-year-old husband Harold (left), have been struggling with infertility for two years and need donations for a 'last hope' IVF session . 'Harold took a lot of persuading, because he didn’t like the idea of airing our laundry in public,' Mrs Alby tells Jane Ridley at the New York Post of their decision to launch the campaign. 'But now he’s amazed at the kindness and generosity that people have shown.' Mrs Alby, who has already undergone several rounds of failed IVF and burned through their $42,000 savings, has found a Virginia clinic which promises that if after six attempts, they don't come home with a healthy baby, they will have their costs refunded. It is unclear exactly why IVF has been unsuccessful so far in this particular case, but Mrs Alby writes: 'What happens naturally for millions of couples every year was unlikely to happen naturally for us.' Hopeful: Scott and Jay Paranada Fried (pictured) are appealing for $5,000 to help with surrogacy costs, and hope to have twins. As an incentive, they are offering 'two free hours with the babies' for donations of $100 . Unusual as this last-ditch effort might sound, it's becoming an increasingly popular strategy for cash-strapped and desperate couples eager to start families. GoFundMe claims that over $1.1million in funding has been raised worldwide for its 'Babies, Kids and Family' category since its 2010 launch. And donations in the last six months alone were a third higher than those raised in the entirety of 2013. In Vitro Fertilization is the process of fertilization by manually combining an egg and sperm in a laboratory dish. When the IVF procedure is successful, the process is combined with a procedure known as embryo transfer, which involves physically placing the embryo in the uterus. IVF costs an average of $12,400 per session in the U.S., and its success rate varies significantly according to a range of factors, especially age. For women under 35, the success rate is 30 to 35per cent, and for women over 40, it's between six and 10per cent. According to Mr and Mrs Alby, responses to their campaign have been largely positive, but for a few suggestions that the couple should 'just adopt' instead, which Mrs Alby admits 'stung a little.' She points out that adoption isn't necessarily easier or even less costly than IVF. If they fail to raise the remaining $27,000 within a month, the couple have the opportunity to take out a loan with the clinic. Jessica Lahl, president of the Center for Bioethics and Culture, is an activist who stands against certain fertility interventions and recently produced Breeders; a documentary which questions the ethics of surrogacy. 'It’s pretty cynical and presumptuous to ask friends, family and strangers for money for crazy expensive IVF,' she tells the Post. 'It’s tacky and tasteless. What are they going to ask for next? The child’s private school or college fund? 'The whole thing operates at the Hallmark sentiment. It’s a case of, ""We want it, so give it to us now.""' Fingers crossed: Vanessa Richmond (pictured with her husband) has never ovulated, and needs $2,000 for 'tests, surgery, medication, and doctors' A quick search on GoFundMe, however, reveals plenty of other childless couples who are going the same route. Scott and Jay Paranada Fried, a newly married gay couple based in Manhattan, New York, are appealing for $5,000 to help with their surrogacy costs, and hope to have twins. As an incentive, they are offering 'a photo with the babies' to those who donate $50, and for $100, donors can have 'two free hours with the babies.' They have so far raised $145. 'It’s tacky and tasteless. What are they going to ask for next? The child’s private school or college fund?' Vanessa Richmond and her husband, from Racine, Wisconsin, have struggled both with their fertility issues, and with their efforts to raise much money on GoFundMe. 'I have several cysts on my ovaries and my LH levels were extremely high... Basically I have never ovulated,' she writes on her page, which has raised $135 in nine months. 'Tests, surgery, medication, and Doctors, we will see!' Needs must: Georgia (left) and Shawn Daniel (right) aren't covered by their insurance. 'We must pay for all medications, ultrasounds, procedures, and blood work out of pocket' they claim, and have so far raised $789 towards their $15,000 goal . Georgia and Shawn Daniel, from Missouri City, Texas, have been trying to conceive for almost nine years. 'I have PCOS and Hypothyroid,' writes Mrs Daniel. 'My insurance excludes all fertility treatment in any form of coverage. We must pay for all medications, ultrasounds, procedures, and blood work out of pocket.' They have so far raised $789 towards their $15,000 goal. According to the latest report from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, more women are turning to IVF than ever before, with over 165,172 procedures performed in the last recorded year, 2012, and 61,740 babies born as a result. The success rate for women under the age of 35 using their own eggs was about 40per cent. For women between ages 35 and 37, it dropped to 31per cent, and for 42-year-olds, the rate was only 3.9per cent. 'We must pay for all medications, ultrasounds, procedures, and blood work out of pocket' And contrary to the huge spike in women turning to IVF in hopes of conceiving - a process which costs an average of $12,400 for one round -  natural births have been declining dramatically in America since 2007, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It remains to be seen whether fertility-challenged couples will win success from the hearts of the public in the form of hefty donations, but regardless, the enterprising trend looks like it's here to stay.","GoFundMe claims that over $1.1million in .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It was one of the defining icons of the 1970s and every child wanted one. Now original designs for the Raleigh Chopper have come to light 45 years after bicycle was first made. The scribbled sketches were just basic outlines but clearly show the bike's most famous features - large U-shaped handlebars, chunky rear wheel and long leather seat. Icon of the 1970s: The original designs for the Raleigh Chopper have come to light 45 years after bicycle was first made. The scribbled sketches were just basic outlines but they clearly show its most famous features - large U-shaped handlebars and rear wheel and long leather seats . The chopper was based on dragster cars and bikes of the 1960s and was a signifier of a child's coolness in the 1970s. Ogle Design produced the concept art for Raleigh's design department headed by Alan Oakley including details such as the padded leather seat and distinctive wheels. The first Chopper went into production in 1969 and became a cultural icon of the 1970s. The first version of the bike featured a gear hub selected using a frame-mounted lever. It had an unusually-shaped frame, high back seat and ape hanger Handlebars as well as differently sized wheels which were 16inches (41cm) at the front and 20inches (51cm) at the back. The design cost £32 for the most basic version at the time. The Mk2 was produced from 1972 until the end of production and had a seat that was moved forward to prevent the bike tipping up as well as other tweaks. Around one and a half million bikes were sold before the BMX craze of the 1980s took over. This was despite the bicycle being unstable, slow, heavy and trickier to ride than conventional bikes. A lighter Mk3 Chopper was launched in 2004 made of aluminium with various safety features. They were drawn by inventor Tom Karen and evolved into formal designs for Raleigh, which produced the first Mark I Choppers in 1969. The bikes, which emulated dragsters, soon became the must-have toy for children across Britain and more than 1.5million of them were made until production ceased in 1979. Mr Karen, 87 has kept the two pages of original drawings, which he took with him when he retired from Ogle Design, the consultancy firm used by Raleigh, in 1999. Since then . his sketch books have been left gathering dust in the garage of his home . in Cambridge, but the grandfather recently rediscovered them . ‘The . sketch books were just for me to do some rough doodles for me to pass . on my ideas to the designers to work on and show to the client,’ he . said. ‘I . left Ogle in 1999 and took these books with me. I have had them in my . garage ever since. They were with a pile of things that I just saved.’ He . was managing director of the company between 1962 and 1999, and in 1968 . his company was approached by British firm Raleigh bicycles help them . come up with a design to rival one of the leading bikes on the market . made by Schwinn. The chopper bikes emulated dragster bikes, soon became the must-have toy for children across Britain and more than 1.5million of them were made until production ceased in 1979 . Creative: The sketches (pictured) were drawn by inventor Tom Karen and evolved into formal designs for Raleigh, which produced the first Mark I Choppers in 1969 . They had tried to compete against the cycle with their Rodeo model, but were unsuccessful. Mr . Karen took inspiration from the dragster cars which have two large . wheels at the back and sketched a picture in a matter of minutes that . went on to became the Chopper. However, Raleigh's . head of design. Alan Oakley claimed to have drawn the very first design . for the Chopper on the back of an envelope in 1967, while he flew back . from the U.S from a trip designed to get to grips with youth culture, . The Telegraph reported. He . saw teenagers in California customising push bikes to look like . dragster motorcycles used by the Hell's Angels by adopting 'ape hanger' handlebars and other features. Mr Karen, 87, (pictured in his study) has kept the two pages of original drawings, which he took with him when he retired from Ogle Design, the consultancy firm used by Raleigh, in 1999 . As well as the famous features of the . bike, Mr Karen said he had the idea to put in gears and springs under the seat. Certain parts were prototyped and eventually the designs were passed to . Raleigh. Mr Karen said: ‘In the 1960s there was a bike made by a company called Schwinn. Mr Karen (pictured) took inspiration from the dragster cars and sketched a picture in a matter of minutes that went on to became the Chopper . ‘It was very sturdy and was great for kids because they could just throw it down on the pavement and then pick it up again and ride away. ‘Raleigh . decided to make a bike to rival the Schwinn and designed something . rather like it, which they called the Rodeo. But unfortunately it . bombed.’ He . explained that Raleigh wanted to reach the same market but to have a . ‘different flavour, so I decided there and then that it must have a big . wheel at the back and a small one at the front.’ The . reason for that was because dragster cars had big wheels at the back . where the power was, and I wanted it to have that feel. I made a quick . sketch within a few minutes in my sketch book.’ The chopper . bike had similar handlebars to the Schwinn. ‘It had a straight frame, a . gear shift that kids loved to use to change speed, and the rear wheel . had some pretend disk brakes,’ Mr Karen said. ‘There was a concern that the saddle was too similar to the Schwinn so we redesigned it and put springs underneath it. ‘We . then delivered the final designs to Raleigh and it became a . considerable success and made a lot of money for them. It was quite . iconic and still is today.’ Raleigh . made two versions of the bike - the Mark I from 1969 to 1972 and then . the Mark II from 1972 to 1979. They also produced a number of limited . edition bikes.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A woman who killed herself after an agonising eight years of ankle pain had been correct about being given botched surgery, it has emerged. Carole Denby, 63, had slipped and broke her left ankle in 2006 but attempts to fix it had been unsuccessful, despite numerous operations. Her husband Howard says an eight-year medical nightmare followed - during which time his wife suffered a stroke and was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Carole Denby killed herself after suffered agonising ankle pain for eight years after a fall . Mrs Denby was convinced surgeons had failed to remove a metal screw after a series of failed operations on her broken ankle. She has now finally been proved right after a metal screw was found in her ashes. Mr Denby, 57, was stunned to be handed a two-inch titanium surgical screw when he collected the cremated remains of his wife. This is despite her medical notes stating: 'There’s no evidence of any significant residual metal within the field of surgery.' Mr Denby says the cremation remains now prove his wife was right all along about a metal screw being left inside her. He blames the titanium screw for giving her ill health in the eight years after her operation - and believes it led to her suspected overdose of prescription tablets. Mrs Denby was convinced surgeons had failed to remove a metal screw after a series of failed operations on her broken ankle. She has now finally been proved right after a metal screw was found in her ashes . He blames the titanium screw for giving his wife ill health in the eight years after her operation - and believes it led to her suspected overdose of prescription tablets. He has now given it to police who are investigating Mrs Denby's death for the coroner. Mr Denby said: 'Carole was adamant there was some metal left over but the doctors wouldn’t listen. 'Being given the screw after her cremation was devastating. It means she was right all along and all her misery was ignored. 'It broke my heart to see her fears and pain dismissed. 'Now I’m planning to present the screw as evidence at the inquest into Carole’s death.' Mrs Denby had her ankle pinned together by surgeons eight years earlier after she broke it while walking in the countryside. But the operation didn’t work and she reacted badly to the metal screws, pins and bolts holding her ankle together. Mr Denby said: 'Being given the screw after Carole's cremation was devastating. It means she was right all along and all her misery was ignored' Surgeons at Morriston Hospital in Swansea operated again and assured the couple all the metal had been removed from her ankle. But Mr Denby, of Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, now believes he and his wife were lied to. He said: 'This screw explains why she continued to develop infections in her blood and swellings in her left ankle. 'She went from this vivacious professional woman to a shell of her former self. 'She suffered serious, recurring infections and developed septicaemia, . which I believe was caused by a reaction to the metal that had been . inserted in her ankle. 'We were advised that she was too young . for an ankle replacement. In May 2010 Carole suffered a severe stroke, . which added considerably to her medical complications. 'By 2011 . she was suffering from delusions and was sectioned under the Mental . Health Act. She had recurring mental health problems that arose from her . physical suffering.' Mr and Mrs Denby on their wedding day. An inquest into her death has been opened by the Carmarthenshire coroner and adjourned while toxicology tests are completed . 'The Health Board repeatedly denied any screws had been left behind and did everything to avoid looking for them. But that is why Carole did what she did. 'She felt her quality of life would never get better if the doctors couldn’t find the screw that she was sure still remained in her leg.' An inquest has been opened by the Carmarthenshire coroner and adjourned while toxicology tests are completed. The Hywel Dda University Health Board, which runs Morriston Hospital, said a review had been carried out on the care given to Mrs Denby.

"By . Sam Webb . Hospital staff were forced to evacuate child patients from a paediatric ward at a London Hospital after a fox plunged through a ceiling. It is believed the animal clambered onto the roof of the North Middlesex University Hospital in Edmonton, north London, while building work was underway. Eight children were evacuated and staff contacted the RSPCA, who helped the animal escape out of a window. Scroll down for video . Scavenger: A fox fell through the ceiling of a London hospital , sparking the evacuation of eight children from the paediatric ward the animal plunged into. No one was hurt in the incident. File picture . It is believed the animal clambered onto the roof of the North Middlesex University Hospital in Edmonton, north London, while building work was being undertaken . A hospital spokesman said no-one was hurt, and that the fox fell through into a 'non-patient' area of the ward. It got onto the roof of a neighbouring building and then broke into the ward's roof space, where it fell through the panels. The spokesman added that the entrance to the roof space was blocked off immediately after the event. The ward was shut for three days while the building was secured. It is thought more than 10,000 foxes live close to humans in London, while 33,000 live in urban areas across Britain. Urban foxes in the capital are seen as a growing problem and have even attacked infants. A baby had its finger torn off when it was attacked by a fox in Bromley, south-east London in February 2013. Mother Hayley Cawley, 28, walked into her living room to find five-week-old Denny Dolan ‘covered in blood’ and a fox dragging the infant towards the front door. Savaged: Denny Dolan, who was seriously injured after a fox attacked him at his home in Bromley, South East London. Surgeons managed to reattach his finger after it was ripped off by the animal . Little Denny also suffered puncture wounds to the face from the animal's fangs . She managed to wrestle her baby out of the animal’s mouth, but his finger was torn off in the attack. Denny had a five-hour operation to have his finger reattached. Mr Dolan’s sister Lorraine Murphy, 42, said her brother had told her what had happened and she had ‘feared the worst’ after the baby was taken to hospital. Speaking at the time, she said: ‘The fox was trying to drag the baby out of the house. Hayley kicked the fox and it ran away. 'The baby was covered with blood and his hand was badly damaged. The fox was shaking the baby by his hand in its teeth and hitting him off the door frame. There was blood everywhere.' Scarred: Isabella and Lola Koupparis were left with 'life-changing' injuries after a fox attacked them in their cot . In June 2010 a mother was horrified when she discovered her twin girls mauled by a fox in their cots. Fashion designer Pauline Koupparis found her nine-month-old daughters covered in blood in the bedroom of their home in in Hackney, North-East London. Isabella and Lola Koupparis were left with 'life-changing' injuries after the attack, which took place as the girls’ parents sat downstairs. The fox crept in through sliding French windows which were open because of the heat and up the stairs into the girls’ bedroom.

In 2011 an inquisitive fox was discovered living the high life at the top of the UK's tallest skyscraper. The intrepid visitor spent two weeks roaming free and surviving on scraps of food left by builders at the 288 metre Shard building at London Bridge. The animal, named Romeo by staff, is thought to have entered via the central stairwell before conquering the climb to reach the building's roof. Romeo was caught by Southwark Council pest control officers and taken to Riverside Animal Centre in Wallington, where the hungry explorer was given a thorough medical and a few good meals, before being released back into the wild. In August 2013 Leon Smith awoke in his home in Hampton Hill, South-West London, and reached out to cuddle his girlfriend, only to discover a fox in his bed. After a 10-minute stand-off the fox only ran away after the IT consultant charged at it shouting. 'I just thought it was the cat, so I thought nothing of it,' Mr Smith said. 'It had walked up my back and was licking my neck for a good couple of seconds. It is thought the animal got in through the catflap.","The animal got into a north London hospital during building work .

"By . Emma Glanfield For Mailonline . Jay Miller, 21, (pictured outside Cardiff Crown Court yesterday), denies four counts of actual bodily harm and one of inflicting grievous bodily harm . A babysitter is accused of assaulting a toddler in his care, causing fractures to both of her arms and leaving her face and ears bruised. Jay Miller, 21, was arrested on suspicion of injuring the little girl after she was admitted to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff with a spiral fracture to her upper right arm. Doctors said a fracture of that kind was usually the result of pulling and twisting an arm and further X-rays revealed the youngster also had two other untreated fractures on her lower arms, both of which were healing. Medics said those fractures could have occurred about 10 days earlier and said the girl's facial bruising could have been caused by slapping or grabbing by an adult hand. Prosecutor Ieuan Bennett told the jury: 'There is no dispute she had the injuries - the question is how were they caused. 'Were they caused accidentally or by an unlawful assault?' Miller, of Barry, Wales, denied four charges of causing actual bodily harm and one of inflicting grievous bodily harm when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday. The jury heard he had minded the young girl in the preceding days when her mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had to go to a hospital appointment. Mr Bennett said: 'He has trouble controlling his temper and when he is under stress, lashes out. 'He was probably having trouble with her - maybe she was crying too loud - one knows not - but he snapped.' He suggested Miller may have lost his temper because the child did not use her potty correctly or had made a mess with her food, and also alleged that at the hospital he was heard muttering: 'I'm sorry'. The child's grandmother told the court she had asked questions about the bruises, which appeared on the child's face and ears in the days before the spiral fracture. She told the court: 'He said he had taken her for a walk and she had fallen down a grass bank and hit a wall.' She said she saw Miller at the hospital as the child was being examined. The court heard how the young girl was found to have fractures to both of her lower arms, a spiral fracture to her upper arm and facial bruising when she was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff (pictured) 'He was sitting with his head down saying ""I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,"" she said. 'I didn't ask him why. Knowing there would be a police investigation, I didn't want to alert him to my concerns and him come up with an explanation.' The child's mother said Miller was concerned when he knew social services were involved. She told the court: 'He said, ""They'll blame me - I'll be going to prison - that's what social services are like.""' Asked about the bruises, Miller told police: 'I know I haven't hit her and never said ""I'm sorry.""' The trial continues.

Jeff Highsmith, 35, spent more than four months piecing the spacecraft together for his four-year-old boy, Jasper, and around $800 on the gravity-defying desk for his six-year-old son, Gavin. The spaceship features a number of switches, sound effects, LED readouts, joysticks and even a fully-functioning robotic arm. Scroll down for video . Out of this world: Father-of-two Jeff Highsmith built this space simulator for his four-year-old boy, Jasper . Having a blast: Gavin Highsmith uses the mission control desk that his father built him . Father-of-two Mr Highsmith, from Raleigh, North Carolina, said: 'When my older son started kindergarten, he needed a desk upon which to do his homework. 'I figured I'd build him a dual purpose desk, one for work and play - thus, the mission control desk was born. 'While building that, I realised that I should do something cool for my other son's room, and the natural solution seemed to be a spaceship.

Missions: Mr Highsmith said that his sons love playing at astronauts and take it in turn to be in charge . Ambitious: The project Mr Highsmith undertook for his sons certainly wasn't' an everyday DIY job . 'They both love playing space and their ability to work together impresses me. 'They haven't learned all the space lingo yet, so their missions are often silly, but that's perfect. 'They spot aliens and deploy payloads and make up all sorts of strange things. 'They incorporate other toys into their space play, as well, such as wooden blocks, Legos, and stuffed animals - they really enjoy using it.' Family bond: Mr Highsmith pictured holding Jasper while his wife, Traci, holds Gavin . Full-time videomaker Mr Highsmith said he completed the entire project from the comfort of his garage and that his sons often enjoy going on 'space mission' together. He said: 'They alternate mission control and astronaut duties - it all depends on who feels like they want to run the show and who feels like they want to fly the ship. 'I designed every aspect to be inexpensive, yet straightforward enough for other self-taught hobbyists to replicate. 'Although it was a rather complicated build, no-one should rule it out as something they can't do. 'I'm not an engineer and I have no formal training in electronics. 'I'm just a self-taught hobbyist fairly far along in my learning journey. 'With the Internet, so much knowledge is available for folks that want to teach themselves new skills.

"By . James Rush . On a hot summer day, when the sun is at its highest and the mercury is rising, there's nothing quite like taking a relaxing dip to cool down. It's not too difficult to understand therefore why this bear was unable to resist the opportunity for a quick paddle after spotting a child's pool while roaming gardens in the San Gabriel Valley region of California. Toshi Miyamoto told NBC Los Angeles that he started filming the scene after his three-year-old triplets spotted the bear relaxing in the pool in their garden on the 90F day. This bear was unable to resist taking a quick dip after spotting a child's paddling pool in a garden in California . Toshi Miyamoto started filming the bear after his three-year-old triplets spotted the bear relaxing in the pool in their garden on the 90F day . The family watched, from behind the safety of a glass conservatory door, as the bear laid down and rolled around in the water. The bear then got out of the pool before climbing over a fence and leaving the garden. Bear sightings are not all that uncommon in certain parts of California. In March last year, MailOnline reported how Justin Lee, of Monrovia, was at home when a baby bear let himself in through the dog flap. The bear was filmed getting out of the pool before it climbed over a fence and left the garden . Mr Lee, 25, immediately grabbed his dog, ran upstairs and locked himself in his room - but not before he took a couple of snaps of the cute, but dangerous, animal, who had a friend waiting by the door. Mr Lee told ABC News: 'We are used to seeing bears outside of our home. They will come to our garden and backyard a lot, it is common in our city, and I've gotten used to seeing them these past two years. 'But when I saw them walk into our house, it was really scary and amusing at the same time.' When he was safe in his room, Mr Lee said he called police who, once on the scene, found the uninvited guest had gotten bored and left to be with his companion.","Toshi Miyamoto filmed the bear in his garden after it was spotted by triplets .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Livingston were hit with an SPFL transfer embargo on Tuesday night after admitting making undeclared cash payments to players. And the troubled Championship club are also the subject of a fresh SFA investigation – just days after major shareholder Neil Rankine was accused of breaching fit and proper person regulations. Currently being sued by former chief executive Ged Nixon for £311,892, the West Lothian outfit wrote to the Hampden authorities blaming Nixon for making ‘improper’ payments worth £10,500. Accusation: The club say that the undeclared payments were made by former CEO Ged Nixon (above) Nursing debts of £1.7million, the club claim they discovered the payments and other irregularities after calling in forensic accountants before immediately declaring them to the SPFL and SFA before they came out in court. Last night, 50-per-cent shareholder Neil Rankine accused Nixon of placing the club’s future at peril, telling Sportsmail: ‘This morning we were hit with a transfer embargo based on a self declaration from the club to the SPFL and SFA dated July 31. ‘The club has declared its findings into its own investigation into a £311,000 claim against the club by the former chief executive Ged Nixon. ‘We dispute that claim and in his own loan account he has made £10,500 worth of unauthorised cash payments to players. ‘In 2010 and 2011, we believe Ged Nixon made improper cash bonus payments to players – unknown to any other directors of shareholders. ‘I don’t think there is any hiding that. We expected that to come out in a court case now rescheduled for next March and the club felt it had to make a declaration of our findings to the necessary authorities. ‘We have that declared in the list of monies he is suing us for. It’s on his own list of cash due. ‘The club has now made these declarations to the relevant authorities and the first response has been from the SPFL, who have informed the chairman Gordon McDougall that the club is under a transfer embargo until the matter is fully investigated. ‘The full consequences of Ged Nixon’s actions are as yet undetermined. Those are for the SFA to determine. ‘But in my opinion there is no one guilty here except Ged Nixon. ‘I do take my share of responsibility in this because I spotted this guy’s shortcomings and tried to have him removed in 2011. ‘But Nixon survived on a casting vote in November 2011.’ The latest wrangle marks another chapter in the tempestuous history of a club enmeshed in controversy and financial strife during the Dominic Keane and Angelo Massone eras. ‘Livingston has continually had people who live beyond their means,’ added Rankine. ‘Mr Nixon came in here, in my opinion, as Mister Big Shot and got involved in offering inducements to players unknown to any other players or officials. Fit and proper? Neil Rankine (left) insists that he hs no case to answer to the SFA . ‘But I have a track record of investing and saving clubs and I intend to see Livingston out of this. ‘My position at the moment is that of an unpaid consultant.’ Rankine also faces an SFA fit and proper person over claims he failed to act ‘in the best interests of association football’ by failing to declare a financial involvement in East Fife and Dumbarton. The action could now force him to hand his shares in Livingston over to fans and walk away. ‘That complaint surprises me,’ he continued. ‘In 2000, East Fife were close to going out of business and I encouraged a family I did business with in the antiques trade to club together and pay the money off as a nice wee investment. ‘I was wrong about that because they put in £400,000 and now can’t give it away. ‘All I tried to do was help them to keep the club afloat. I have no shares, never have had and never will have any financial interest in East Fife FC. ‘With Dumbarton, I sold the club in 2008 for £1.7m and the owners still owe me £200,000. ‘Is that a conflict of interest? The SFA must think it is and if it is then I have the choice of either suing Dumbarton for the £200,000 or disposing of my shares in the holding company of Livingston which have a trading value at the moment of zero. Distraction: On the pitch Livingston had a disappointing start to the season, losing 2-1 to Hibs . ‘It may now be in the best interests of Livingston FC for me to stand down from Livingston 5 (the club’s parent company) and try to accelerate a deal Supporters Direct are trying to push forward for community ownership. ‘But I will be astonished if there is any case to answer, because I have no financial interest in East Fife. ‘The SFA investigated this is 2004 and found no case to answer then. I don’t know what’s changed now.’ A spokesman for the SPFL said: ‘The SPFL has been provided with information by a Livingston Football Club director which indicates a default in relation to HMRC payments. ‘Under SPFL rules, an embargo on the registration of professional players is automatic in these circumstances.’ When contacted by the media yesterday, Nixon declined to comment on the matter because of the ongoing legal case.","Club admitted payments after accountants discovered irregularities .

"By . Simon Jones . Leon Osman is in Claire House Children's Hospice painting with Jasmine Beedles but the 12-year-old has a dark secret she is worried about sharing; she is a Manchester United fan. Her father is to blame she says and he wouldn't like her talking to an Everton player. Chirpy Jasmine has DiGeorge Syndrome which affects her heart and breathing. She and her family are regular visitors to the Wirral-based hospice that gives respite and care for children with life-limiting conditions. Osman is happy sharing centre stage with the children. He is a huge fan and has chosen the hospice as one of the charities to benefit from his forthcoming testimonial when Everton face Porto at Goodison Park this Sunday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lukaku return marks significant day in Everton history . Nice guy: Leon Osman poses for a picture with Jasmine Beedles at Claire House Hospice . Secret: Jasmine Beedles didn't want to tell Leon Osman that she was a Manchester United fan . High fives: Leon Osman is a big supporter of the work done at Claire House Hospice in Liverpool . Opening up: Leon Osman was forthright about his desire to win a trophy with Everton . Leon Osman made his league debut 11 years ago as a substitute in Everton's 4-3 defeat to Tottenham at White Hart Lane on January 12 2003. Tottenham: Kasey Keller; Stephen Carr, Gary Doherty, Chris Perry, Goran Bunjevcevic; Ledley King, Gus Poyet, Darren Anderton, Simon Davies; Robbie Keane, Steffen Iversen (sub: Milenko Acimov) Scorers: Gus Poyet 14; Robbie Keane 50, 68, 83 . Everton: Espen Baardsen; Alessandro Pistone, David Unsworth, Alan Stubbs, Steve Watson; Joseph Yobo (sub: Lee Carsley), Gary Naysmith, Scot Gemmill, Li Tie (sub: Leon Osman); Brian McBride, Tomasz Radzinski . Scorers: Brian McBride 10, Steve Watson 58, Tomasz Radzinski 74 . Ref: Steve Dunn Attendance: 36,070 . His connection was borne out of tragedy, a family bereavement. Osman lost two cousins, sisters Kelly and Stacey Bond, to cystic fibrosis. Seeing what his family went through made Osman, a father of three young children himself, want to help. 'I connected from probably the first time I came here,' he says taking a pause from his poster-paint landscape. 'I was deeply moved by everything that is done. 'I had a family bereavement a few years back and they didn't get as far as Claire House. The Make A Wish Foundation, the other charity I support, took them away but this would have been the next step. 'I saw at first hand what a difference they can make to not just the kids but parents too. It provides families with good memories and gives them a break from what they are going through. I just wanted to try and help with the process.' The 33-year-old Osman doesn't really fit with football stereotypes. A slightly-built, clever, technically gifted player, he made his breakthrough when the Premier League's penchant was for tall, strong and powerful. Even then a serious knee injury almost derailed his career before it had begun. Still got it: Leon Osman scores against Tranmere in a pre-season friendly win . True blue: Leon Osman (right) has played for Everton more than 11 years now . He has been with boyhood club Everton since the age of 10. A member of their 1998 FA Youth Cup winning side with the likes of Richard Dunne, Francis Jeffers and Danny Cadamarteri, he scored in the final against Blackburn Rovers with a clipped right foot volley. It is 11 years since Osman made his league debut for Everton as a late substitute for Chinese midfielder Li Tie in a 4-3 defeat at Tottenham. The game was also notable for being goalkeeper Espen Baardsen's only Everton appearance while Robbie Keane grabbed a hat-trick and a certain Sunderland manager Gus Poyet was also on target for Tottenham. More than 380 appearances later, Osman is being rewarded with his testimonial against Porto. 'I certainly never envisaged being here,' he reflected. 'I didn't look that far ahead. It was all about setting goals; going from the youth team, getting games for the reserves, getting games for the first team. National service: Leon Osman (right) with Gary Cahill and Theo Walcott (centre) in February last year . Proud: Leon Osman has two England caps and addressed the media before a friendly against Swede in 2012 . Technically gifted: Leon Osman impressed with his range of passing for club and country . 'It feels very weird having a testimonial. The attention is all on you. I have gone through my career without asking for attention so it will be strange knowing everyone is going to be pointing at me as I walk onto the pitch. 'Football has changed so much since that first game. Mainly in its professionalism. When I got into the squad I was told players were looking after themselves better but now it's much different again.' Can he reason then with Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere's smoking episode? 'I don't know about that. Personally, I've never smoked and I don't understand that. People go out for a glass of wine but I don't think there is the drinking through the week anymore that used to go on. 'Players don't drink much, if at all, in some cases, they eat the right things; off the field you have computer analysis for preparation. You have fitness coaches, who have assistants to assess another part of you, who have assistants to tell you what muscle groups you're using. 'When I started there were some doing things the right way, there were some who didn't bother until the day before the game. I used to think I could get away with eating what I wanted but now the preparation starts as soon as you finish the last game.' VIDEO Lukaku return marks significant day in Everton history . Record buy: Romelu Lukaku completed his £28m move to Everton from Chelsea . Osman figured in every league game under Roberto Martinez last season, the only Everton player to do so and insists he is still improving. 'I have improved. I had good advice from great senior pro's likes David Weir, Alan Stubbs and Duncan Ferguson and I know I'd be quick to help a young player today if I thought they weren't doing things right. You need to if you want to last longer.' While two England caps, picked up against Sweden and San Marino, have helped make Osman's career more complete there is no disguising what he yearns for most. 'The one thing, the only thing, since I got into the first team is to win a trophy,' he says. 'We've come close but it hasn't been achieved yet and seriously needs to be addressed. With the quality of players we have had over the years and now, with the likes of Romelu Lukaku joining, we should be challenging.' Testimonials, trophies? Sounds like a scene Osman's fans, even those of Manchester United persuasion, will be happy to paint.

"By . Tania Steere . Playing football is one of the staples of childhood in Britain. But a top neuro-surgeon has now said youngsters should be banned from heading the ball because it is too dangerous. Dr Michael Grey, a motor neuro-science expert at the University of Birmingham, says the impact of the brain against the skull causes damage. No brainer: Top neuro-surgeon Michael Grey has said youngsters should be banned from heading footballs . Children’s neck muscles are not developed enough to handle the shock of impact, he said. Several high profile doctors have warned about children heading footballs after scans have shown apparent damage to the brains of professional players. However research and animal experiments have resulted in mixed findings. Dr Grey told Sky News: ‘I do not think that children should stop sport, the obesity epidemic means we need to encourage them. ‘But we do need to look at rule changes and the way we train children. ‘Children should not be heading the ball. We don’t know at what age children’s necks become strong enough to withstand the movement of the head when the head is struck by the ball. ‘Some of my colleagues have suggested 14 but I really think it is individual. In addition the brain starts to shake and rotates when the head is struck by the ball. ‘The brain bounces back and forth and it is the impact of the brain against the inside of the skull causes additional damage.’ His comments come as the Football Association issue new guidelines on concussion and head injuries. Boys will be boys: They should play sport but should not head the ball says Dr Michael Grey . The new rules stipulate that if a player loses consciousness they must be immediately taken off the pitch and not allowed to return to play. But if there is not a loss of consciousness, it is up to the team doctor to decide when a player should carry on if they can should come off the field after a blow to the head. Some schools in the US have already banned children from heading the ball during games. An inquest into the death in 2002 of England and West Bromwich Albion footballer Jeff Astle ruled that he died from an ‘industrial disease’ – brain damage linked to heading a heavy ball throughout his career. West Brom and England footballer Jeff Astle died of industrial disease - heading the ball . The new FA rules have angered the family of Astle as they have no specific guidance to heading the ball and the effect it can have. Dawn Astle, his daughter, said: ‘We know what killed dad, the coroner’s court said it was industrial disease: heading footballs killed dad and the Football Association just don’t acknowledge it. ‘Twelve-and-a-half years on, they still haven’t acknowledged what killed him. ‘We have real worries, not just for current footballers, and of course not just professionals - we’re talking about amateurs as well - but about football’s future, about the children in the game. ‘They need to know the risks, then they can make informed choices.’ The Astle family and one of the world’s leading neuro-surgeons, Dr Willie Stewart, are meeting FA representatives including chairman Greg Dyke to persuade them of their case. A report by MP, Chris Bryant and paralympic gold medalist and member of the House of Lords, Baroness Grey-Thompson, entitled ‘Concussion can kill’ called for a parliamentary investigation into head injuries in sport. Published in June, the report asks if steps can be taken to limit the number of times players head the ball in football, particularly young players. It said there should be a set of consistent guidelines across all sports to ensure concussion is diagnosed promptly and the player appropriately treated. Dr Grey said there is new evidence coming to light showing the need to be concerned but it is a ‘difficult issue’. Dr Grey added: ‘Our challenge is that because it is such a difficult issue. We know some people are very susceptible to getting head injuries in these situations and some are quite resilient and we don’t know why yet.’ He said parents and coaches need to be educated about secondary concussion syndrome and guidelines need to be followed. He added: ‘In essence we need to protect players from themselves.’","Children’s neck muscles are not developed enough to handle shock of impact .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . The symmetry was almost cruel. A week that began with Jack Nicklaus’s prediction that Rory McIlroy could win ‘15 to 20 majors’ was ending with Tiger Woods limping out of yet another tournament. While 36-hole leader McIlroy went about his weekend’s work at the USPGA Championship here with all the single-minded ruthlessness of a man who expected to win, the last incumbent to feel such empowerment was resigned to feeling all too mortal. Who knows when we will next see Woods, destined perhaps to be stuck forever just outside the range of achievement that represented his lifetime goal, but it did not sound like it would be at the Ryder Cup or before the fall of autumn leaves. In pain: The 14-time major champion has been a shadow of his former self as injuries interrupt his game . ‘What this week has shown me is that I have to get stronger and I can’t do that playing tournament golf,’ he said. ‘You can’t burn the candle at both ends.’ One thing for certain is that Woods is done for this PGA Tour year, which ends in mid-September, having racked up statistics of such mind-numbing mediocrity that those of us who have followed him his entire career can feel merely sadness that it has come to this. Here in the hometown of the Louisville Lip, we now know how boxing writers felt covering the last years of The Greatest. Either side of missing four months of the season owing to back surgery, Woods played seven PGA Tour events, withdrawing twice, missing two halfway cuts, finishing no better than 25th and making a total £64,000. That is less than he made in each of 176 other events throughout his career. In two majors, he racked up his worst 72-hole finish in a Grand Slam event at The Open and followed it by missing the halfway cut here by five shots, after two rounds of 74 left him 16 strokes behind McIlroy. Pulling out: Azinger says he expects Woods to make Tom Watson's decision for him, but choosing not to play . Woods will not play in the Wyndham Championship this week and cannot play in the FedEx Cup play-offs that follow because he has not qualified, meaning that, if Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson picked him on September 2, it would be a gamble beyond reckless. It would also be doing Woods no favours, for what we saw last week was pitiful. At 38, with his long list of injuries, fully fit is a goal that is simply unattainable. But he has to get to a point where he can swing the club free of pain before we see him again. The only thing on his schedule is a lucrative exhibition date in Argentina at the end of October and that sounds a suitable timeframe to see if his body can heal to the point where it will allow him to resume his career. Credit Woods for the way he conducted himself afterwards. He was clearly in considerable discomfort but did not duck his media duties, spending 15 minutes answering questions from the media. When will we see you again? What will you be saying to Watson? How long will it take to get healthy? And so on. There were no particularly revealing answers because what can he say until he gets healthy? Forget any thoughts about 18 majors. That is the only goal the 14-time major winner should have now. Pulling out: Azinger says he expects Woods to make Tom Watson's decision for him, but choosing not to play . While Woods left the building, enter his natural successor riding the form of his life. How poetic that McIlroy should take 133 shots for his first two rounds, just as Tiger did in winning the PGA here in 2000. McIlroy will try to add the Wanamaker Trophy today to the Claret Jug he won just three Sundays ago and make it four majors claimed from the last 15 played. One major a year is the sort of ratio Nicklaus and Woods managed in their heyday, when they had little else to worry about but playing golf. Even if he does not win on Sunday, it would not change anything for McIlroy. He knows the next five years are the ones where, if he is going to make it into double digits in majors, he has to do the damage. There was enough going on in his second round on Friday to act as a wake-up call that number four was not a given. True, he shot 67, but he knew he would be lucky to do that again if his long game was as average. Waiting to pounce: McIlroy may not win this week, but now is his time as Tiger's comes to an end . A good-looking leaderboard was also packed with fearless opponents. Australian Jason Day began just one behind, while Rickie Fowler was two adrift. Both will win majors at some point. Henrik Stenson trailed by four. There were the doughty veterans Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson and Lee Westwood, plus a couple of unsung Europeans in Bernd Wiesberger from Austria and perhaps Europe’s most underrated golfer, Finland’s Mikko Ilonen. No wonder McIlroy was concentrating on the job at hand. ‘He obviously thinks I’m pretty good then,’ he said, grinning, when asked about Nicklaus’s majors remark. ‘I’m just trying to get to four and, when I do, I’ll try to get to five and so on. I don’t want to put a number on how many because if you say you want 15 and you ‘only’ win 10, does that mean you’ll feel disappointed?’ Let us enjoy the Rory era while we can. One look at Tiger emphasises the point that, even for the great ones, it does not last forever.","Woods cut a sorry sight as injury hampered his second round .

"By . Adam Crafton . Follow @@AdamCrafton_ . When Louis van Gaal leads his team out for the first time at Old Trafford against Valencia on Tuesday evening, we should receive a clear indication of the players that will form a central part of the Dutchman's plans at Old Trafford in the opening weeks of the season. With the likes of Anderson, Nani and Marouane Fellaini already cut adrift, Sportsmail identifies five players hoping to seal a place in the starting line-up for the visit of Swansea when the Barclays Premier League kicks off this weekend. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal wants reinforcements . Home bow: Louis van Gaal takes charge of Manchester United at Old Trafford for the first time on Tuesday . Warm welcome: Van Gaal has overseen a successful pre-season but much tougher challenges lie ahead . Danny Welbeck . Van Gaal's 3-5-2 system will bring a welcome end to the days where Welbeck would be expected to do a shift in the wide positions. His opportunities will now come through the middle and nobody should underestimate how important that is for the England forward. There was credence to the reports that Welbeck was considering a move towards the end of last season. He has always been a little sensitive to the microscope being placed over his goalscoring return when defensive priorities have been emphasised so much by previous managers David Moyes and Sir Alex Ferguson. Welbeck recorded a good return of 11 last season but only scored three after the turn of the year. If he is to flourish centrally, Van Gaal will need to count on Welbeck to hit 15 this season. With Robin van Persie still returning to peak condition after his World Cup exertions and doubts surrounding the future of Javier Hernandez, an eye-catching performance on Tuesday should see Welbeck seal his place in the starting line-up on Saturday. Point to prove: Danny Welbeck (left) must show he can fit into a side with Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney . Ashley Young . After a truly disappointing 18 months, Young's renaissance under Van Gaal has been nothing short of remarkable. Ineffectual and frustrating under Moyes, Young has been reenergised in the left wing-back position and looks likely to now be retained by the Dutchman. On the evidence of this summer, most United followers will agree with that decision and that would have been unthinkable at the end of last season. Nonetheless, it is still expected that Luke Shaw will be the first-choice option in the position but with Van Gaal making clear his doubts over the 19-year-old's fitness just a couple of weeks ago, Young could yet have the chance to start when the Premier League returns this weekend. Renaissance: Ashley Young (left) has enjoyed an impressive pre-season after struggling under David Moyes . Darren Fletcher . With Michael Carrick suffering a serious injury in pre-season, an opportunity has emerged in the midfield positions for Fletcher, who was outstanding in pre-season match against Real Madrid. Finally, after a debilitating bowel disorder that - as he admitted - left him one make-or-break procedure away from retirement, Fletcher appears to be back to his best. Still only 30, a fit and dynamic Fletcher has much to offer to United and his courage has only increased his popularity among the Old Trafford support. The Scot only made 12 starts last season and Moyes, it is understood, would have been open to the idea of selling him if United received the right offer this summer. That would now appear unlikely under Van Gaal, with Ander Herrera the only arrival in central midfield and Fletcher demonstrating his credentials so clearly in the USA. VIDEO Van Gaal wants reinforcements . Back in favour: Darren Fletcher could have a key role to play in the Manchester United midfield this season . Tom Cleverley . The scapegoat for many of United's ills last season, Cleverley certainly appears more relaxed and content under the leadership of Van Gaal. The 25-year-old captained United in the States against Roma and he is determined to make it work at Old Trafford. At varying points, Ferguson,  Moyes, Roberto Martinez, Gary Neville, Roy Hodgson and Ryan Giggs have all seen things they admire in this player and Van Gaal, also, sees a place for Cleverley in his squad. He will know that he must add more goals to his game and that he must bring greater control to the United midfield. Last season, he came up a little short - but then again, who didn't in a red shirt? With Carrick injured - and Fellaini and Anderson on their way out - Cleverley must shine this season. Getting stuck in: Tom Cleverley's career stalled last season and he must prove he can fulfil his potential . Shinji Kagawa . The Japanese playmaker has performed only in fits and starts in his two seasons at Old Trafford, although he would argue that he has been forced out of his favoured position behind the forwards and onto the left-wing all too often. Failed to score in 30 appearances under Moyes last season but Van Gaal appears to have seen something and Kagawa will act as back-up behind Juan Mata and the emerging Adnan Januzaj in the hole this season. If Mata is fit, he will start on Saturday but a classy performance from Kagawa at Old Trafford on Tuesday may cause Van Gaal a headache ahead of his first Premier League game this weekend. Last chance? Shinji Kagawa has yet to perform at his best after two years at Old Trafford .","Manchester United play Valencia in their final pre-season friendlyon Tuesday .

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . Eilidh Child and Lynsey Sharp, the poster girls of Glasgow 2014, impressed as they got their European Championships under way on Wednesday. Two weeks on from shining at Hampden Park, the Scottish duo donned the British vest as they in went in search of more medal success. Child just missed out on the Commonwealth crown in the 400 metres hurdles but showed no sign of a hangover as she blew away the field in the heats. Ease: Eilidh Child comfortably qualified from her 400m hurdles heat at the European Championships in Zurich . Impressive: Scottish athlete Lynsey Sharp also qualified comfortably at the European Championships . Quick: Child's time of 55.32 seconds was the fastest time in qualification for the semi-finals on Thursday . The world finalist eased through as the fastest qualifier in 55.32 seconds, but clearly had a lot more in the tank. 'I felt more nervous for Glasgow as I had that attention on me but here I'm the favourite,' Child said. 'It's a bit different but I have the exact same attitude as Glasgow. 'I just need to go in there and execute my race and if I do that I'll be happy whatever the outcome. I said the same with Glasgow.' Child went in the first track heat of the day, with fellow Commonwealth silver medallist Sharp involved in the last of the session. The 24-year-old became the pride of Scotland just two weeks ago after overcoming the odds to finish runner-up in the 800m. Surprise: Sharp performed excellently when she was ill at the Commonwealth Games to claim silver . Jump: Child advances over one of the hurdles during her heats at the European Championships in Zurich . Sharp was on a drip in the athletes' village clinic until 5.30am on the morning of the Hampden final yet managed to secure silver, which she hopes to add to by retaining the European crown she won after Yelena Arzhakova of Russia received a two-year doping ban. She had to wait a year to get her hands on the gold medal and underlined her desire to top the podium outright in Zurich by impressively winning her heat. 'I'm fresh off the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow so this was fun,' Sharp said. 'It's just another race, I was excited to compete - I'm loving it this year. It wasn't the plan to control the race from the front, now it's onwards and upwards.' Sharp is joined in Thursday's semi-finals by British team-mates Jessica Judd and Alison Leonard, who won her heat in the quickest qualifying time of two minutes 01.47secs. The full complement of 110m hurdlers also made it through their heats on a grey, drizzly morning in Zurich, with Andrew Clarke automatically qualifying and 2010 European champion Andy Turner making it through as a fastest loser. Qualification: Britain's Chris Baker is through to Friday's high jump final after finishing ninth in Zurich . Through: Baker will compete in Friday's high jump final at the European Championships after jumping 2.23m . Commonwealth silver medallist Will Sharman led the British charge, with his time of 13.29s the joint quickest in the heats alongside favourites Pascal Martinot-Lagarde and Sergey Shubenkov. 'I'm pleased with that,' the 29-year-old said. 'I wanted to execute exactly what I needed to. 'You've got to be competitive even in the first round - there's lots of good guys who'll be in the final, I can't wait to scrap it out with them. 'It's about delivering when it matters, I've been consistent this year.' Elsewhere, Chris Baker avoided any major hiccups in reaching Friday's high jump final with a leap of 2.23m, ranking him joint ninth, while in the city centre Tom Bosworth finished the 20km race walk final in 12th.

A long-time breakaway group of five were together entering the final few hundred metres of the 200km course on The Mall but 24-year-old Blythe of the lowly NFTO team blasted out from the back, catching his favoured rivals cold. He had enough power to hold off fellow Briton Ben Swift of Team Sky and Omega Pharma-Quick Step’s Julian Alaphilippe.

Torrential rain left the course puddle-strewn and some of the riders failed to stay upright in the early stages as the treacherous conditions and narrow country lanes took their toll. But as the route, much of which was used during the London 2012 Olympic Games, dried out, an 11-man breakaway took place that included 2012 world road race champion Philippe Gilbert. That was trimmed to five to set up a superb finale as the main peloton, including 2012 Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins, was unable to pull the breakaway group back. The race completed a memorable weekend of cycling in the capital, which earlier in the day featured 24,000 amateur riders tackling a sportive over much of the same course after Saturday’s freecycle event where 55,000 riders enjoyed 10 miles of traffic-free roads in the centre of the city.

James Gray poked in to halve the deficit and Leeds lived on their nerves after Gaetano Berardi was red-carded for a wild challenge on Stanley substitute Rob Atkinson. After securing progress to the second round of the Capital One Cup, Hockaday confirmed Leeds hope to complete a trio of deals – Southampton striker Billy Sharp and Chesterfield centre-back Liam Cooper joining permanently, and another Catania player Giuseppe Bellusci on a season-long loan – on Wednesday. 'If they pass their medicals and sign contracts then we can discuss them,' he said, cautiously. 'But we have been really close to some signings and they have fallen through for whatever reason so I don't want to talk about people until they are my players.' Doukara eased United into a 2-0 interval lead with a couple of classy strikes. First, he controlled Swiss international Berardi's low cross to fire in from the edge of the box. Then, latching onto academy product Lewis Cook's teasing through ball, he switched the ball to his left foot to curl in the second on the run seven minutes before the break. 'He didn't do himself justice on Saturday at Millwall, he was a rabbit in the headlights,' Hockaday said. 'But he looked impressive tonight. The thing about him is he's got potential and my definition of potential is that you haven't done anything yet.' James Beattie's Accrington re-emerged with greater purpose, and an altered formation, at the start of the second period and went close just four minutes when James Gray's header looped over. But he did find the net with his next effort as he poked in from close range late six minutes from time. When Berardi departed for his reckless tackle, silence enveloped Elland Road but Leeds ran down the clock to ensure Hockaday's first win since replacing Brian McDermott at the helm. 'I am happy we are in the next round, that's what this was all about and we have achieved it,' Hockaday added.

But Warburton was far from impressed with what he saw, he said: ‘The players described that as embarrassing, disappointing and frustrating. ‘From a position of total dominance in the first half and we could have scored more to suddenly giving goals away. ‘There was a lot of poor defending and I have never seen a game like that before and I don't want to see another one like it again. ‘We have to be better than that and that is no disrespect to Dagenham, they showed fantastic character and must have fancied their chances at 6-5 up.’ Brentford raced into a two-goal lead inside 10 minutes thanks to a Stuart Dallas brace. The Northern Ireland midfielder scored his first after sliding in at the far post, and his second from the edge of the box. Ashley Hemmings crossed for George Porter to score as Dagenham pulled a goal back. A tropical storm midway through the first half made playing conditions very difficult for both sides. And it was Dagenham who struggled the most as Scott Doe and played a terrible back pass to O’Brien and Proschwitz nipped in to score his first goal for Brentford since joining from Hull in the summer. But every time Dagenham looked like they were down and out they dragged themselves up. And on the stroke of half-time Ashley Chambers broke clear and lifted the ball over Lee to bring the home side back into the game. Andre Boucaud then wrong-footed Lee from 25 yards with an excellent strike to draw the League Two side level at 3-3.

Brentford thought they had won when Alan Judge broke into the Dagenham box and pulled the ball across for Andre Gray to score from close range. But with seconds remaining on the clock, Dagenham’s Hemmings scored a spectacular goal to send the game into extra time. Brentford struck first in extra time through Moore, who capped off an impressive debut. But Dagenham never knew when they were beaten and Jamie Cureton levelled the game yet again. Hemmings completed Dagenham’s incredible comeback with another shot from the edge of the area to make it 6-5, but Harlee Dean came to Brentford’s rescue in the dying minutes of extra time, heading home Jake Bidwell’s cross to send the game to penalties. Lee went the right way to deny Conners and Chambers as Brentford scored all their spot-kicks to win 4-2. And Warburton added: ‘Richard Lee proved what a good goalkeeper he is at penalties, he relishes that one-on-one situation and he did a great job for us.'","Richard Lee was the hero as the Bees edged through to the Capital One Cup second round .

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . Graeme McDowell is confident he will make a fourth consecutive Ryder Cup appearance one way or the other at Gleneagles next month. A run of three top-10-finishes after a successful title defence at the French Open lifted McDowell into the automatic qualifying places at the start of the US PGA Championship. But with less than three points separating McDowell, Jamie Donaldson and Luke Donald in eighth, ninth and 10th in the standings respectively, the former US Open champion could still need to rely on a wild card from European captain Paul McGinley. Teeing off: McDowell watches his tee shot at the eighth in a round that was wrecked by a quadruple-bogey . 'I want to be in the automatic spots if I possibly can,' said McDowell, who has just one qualifying event left on his schedule, the first FedEx Cup event in a fortnight's time. 'I will be going out there tomorrow all guns blazing and trying to shoot a low number to finish the week. Ryder Cup is very, very important to me. 'I'm not uncomfortable. I'm optimisitic about the way I'm playing, I'm optimisitc about my chances of finishing in the automatic spots and I'd be farily optimistic of the chances of a pick. I am not really too worried about it. 'My form the last couple of months has certainly shown the captain that I'm playing well. I will take a week off then get ready for the play-offs, keep some energy in the tank. 'I think I am pretty much guaranteed (to qualify for) the first three play-offs, but we are having our baby the second week so I will spend that week at home and experience that next chapter in my life.' McDowell, who secured the winning point at Celtic Manor in 2010, was in the first group out in the third round at Valhalla and finished play before tournament officials were ready to record his score and that of playing partner Brendon Todd. Not his day: It's been a tough tournament for the Northern Irishman who doesn't have the power to compete . In McDowell's case it was a level-par 71 which featured four birdies but a quadruple-bogey eight on the 13th, where he hit two approach shots into water surrounding the green. 'I played beautifully this morning, it's so disappointing to make an elementary quadruple bogey, a card-wrecker, tournament-wrecker, weekend-wrecker, all of the above really,' McDowell added. 'I think there might have been mud on the first ball but my second attempt was a bad shot. 'This was not really a course I was going to be able to compete on. I'm 71st in driving distance this week out of the 74 players who made the cut. The damage was done Thursday, I didn't really feel myself. My lower back was in bad shape on Friday and this morning was the only day I felt ready for it. 'It's a slog out there when you are only moving it 280 (yards) off the tee. You say 'only' 280 but it really is in this day and age when Jason Day is flying it 320, Rory is flying it 330. I am four shots behind these guys before I tee it up each day so I have to play very well elsewhere which I just haven't done. 'I'm literally wearing the grooves off my 5-wood, 3-hybrid and my four and five irons.'","McDowell is currently in the qualifying positions for European team .

"By . Paul Casey, Press Association . Former captain Paul Azinger would not pick Tiger Woods for this year's Ryder Cup and believes the 14-time major winner will rule himself out of the contest at Gleneagles. Azinger led the United States to their only victory in the 21st century at Valhalla in 2008, when Woods was ruled out through injury. And with the former world number one again struggling for form and fitness, Azinger does not think current captain Tom Watson can afford to use one of his three wild cards on Woods on September 2. The nine automatic qualifiers are decided on Sunday. Suffering: Woods played through the pain at Valhalla but missed the cut by some distance . 'I don't see how you can take an injured player who is not playing well,' Azinger told the Golf Channel. 'I don't think I would. And also Tiger has not necessarily been the formula for success either. I just don't see how you can pick him at this point. 'I am guessing he will call Tom and beg out of this and say 'I am not ready', make Tom's decision easier.' The bare statistics make grim reading for Woods after the worst year of his career came to an end at the US PGA Championship. Woods missed the cut for just the fourth time in 66 major championships as a professional at Valhalla, carding consecutive rounds of 74 and suffering more of the back problems which have blighted his campaign. The 38-year-old will not play in next week's Wyndham Championship and cannot qualify for the FedEx Cup play-offs - missing out for just the second time since the post-season began in 2007 - leaving just the Ryder Cup to aim for. Woods has made just seven starts all season, the second fewest in his career, missing three months and the Masters and US Open after undergoing back surgery on March 31. He has recorded no top-10 finishes for the first time and earned just 108,275 US dollars (£64,543), and while he is not exactly short of money, it should be noted that he has earned more than that in 176 individual PGA Tour events in his career. Pulling out: Azinger says he expects Woods to make Tom Watson's decision for him, but choosing not to play . But as grim as the statistics are, perhaps what is most telling was the 14-time major winner's response when asked when he will play again. 'I don't know,' the 38-year-old said. And asked what he would say if Watson calls and asks about the Ryder Cup, the response was the same: 'I don't know, he hasn't called.' Whether Watson calls at all remains to be seen, with Woods far from the only player causing the 64-year-old some sleepless nights ahead of next month's contest at Gleneagles. World number six Matt Kuchar, who has already secured his place on the team, pulled out before the start of the US PGA due to back spasms, while defending champion Jason Dufner lasted just 10 holes before being forced to withdraw with a neck injury. Dufner started the week eighth in the Ryder Cup standings with the top nine on Sunday evening qualifying automatically, but dropped to ninth after Zach Johnson made the cut at Valhalla and said he was not sure when he would be able to play again. Dustin Johnson, who was the only American player unbeaten at Medinah in 2012, was fifth in the standings before declaring himself unavailable as he takes a leave of absence to deal with 'personal challenges'. In pain: The 14-time major champion has been a shadow of his former self as injuries interrupt his game . As former European captain Colin Montgomerie said this week, it would be a massive gamble for Watson to pick players who are not fully fit, with the prospect of them needing to play five matches in three days at Gleneagles. Woods will at least try to get fit as soon as possible, admitting he was too stubborn to withdraw before his second round at Valhalla despite reinjuring himself on the range. 'I need to get stronger, I need to get my glutes strong again, my abs and my core back to where I used to have them,' he said. 'They are just not quite there yet. 'I couldn't make a backswing. Coming through (the ball) is fine, I can't get the club back. (The injury) throws everything off. I can't get anywhere near the positions that I'm accustomed to getting to. I can't do it. I've got to rely on timing, hands, and hopefully I can time it just right. 'It's hard because you want the bigger muscles controlling the golf swing. I have got to rely on my hands to do it. The face is rotating so fast through impact because I'm just not able to get my arms and the body in the correct spot.'","Woods missed cut at US PGA Championship after struggling with injury .

"By . Associated Press . Indiana Pacers All-Star Paul George has undergone successful surgery on his broken right leg and is expected to remain in the hospital for about three days. The six-foot 10-inch George had an operation at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas to repair the open tibia-fibula fracture, USA Basketball said in a statement early Saturday morning. Dr. David Silverberg, Dr. Joseph Yu and USA Basketball team physician Riley Williams, were present for the surgery, the release said. George suffered the gruesome right leg injury late in the U.S. national team's intrasquad scrimmage Friday night. He leaped to contest a fast-break layup by James Harden with 9:33 left in the fourth quarter and his leg smashed against the bottom of the backboard stanchion and crumpled. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT - SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Disaster: Paul George suffered a gruesome leg break during a Team USA inter-squad game in Las Vegas . Trainers immediately ran onto the floor and after roughly 10 minutes of stoppage, George was taken out of the arena on a stretcher. With players looking visibly upset, coach Mike Krzyzewski then announced to the crowd that the scrimmage would not be finished out of respect to George and his family.On Saturday morning, Larry Bird, the Pacers president of basketball operations, issued an updated statement saying it's too early to start talking about George's expected return.'We are hopeful at some point next week Paul will return to Indianapolis to continue his recovery,' Bird said. 'There is no question about the impact on our team but our goal is to be as strong-willed and determined as Paul will be in coming back. Our franchise has had setbacks in its history but has demonstrated the abilities to recover. Paul will provide the example of that off the court and it is up to the rest of us to provide that example on the court. Any discussion regarding the future of our team would be inappropriate at this time. Our focus is solely on Paul and doing whatever we can to help.'Bird also said the Pacers are committed to helping the national team give basketball a global reach.'This is a first for us in USA Basketball, to have something like this take place,' USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo said. 'It's a tough situation for our entire organization, the coaches, the players. Very, very emotional. There's no way the game could have gone on under the circumstances.' Flat out: The Indiana Pacers lays on the floor after a devastating injury that ruled him out of the World Cup . Moment: George (left) lands awkwardly after contesting a lay-up from James Harden (second left) Doctors estimate a full recovery could take as much as 18 months.Dr. Patrick Kersey, who treated Louisville guard Kevin Ware when he sustained a similar injury during the NCAA tournament regional finals in 2013, said George will likely need 6 to 12 weeks to recover from surgery and another 6 to 10 weeks to get back to a normal walking gait. Kersey is not treating George.A complete recovery, Kersey said, normally takes 12 to 18 months, though the fact he is an elite athlete in top shape could speed up that timeframe.The hardest part for the Pacers might be keeping George off the court once he thinks he's ready.'It's a challenge because (athletes) want to push the envelope always,' Kersey said. 'The question that is already being asked this morning is how quickly can he get back. He needs to heal. First, he has to get back to a normal life, then his body needs to work in an efficient way and once those pieces are in place, he can start training.'George was considered a lock to make the final 12-man roster for the World Cup of Basketball that starts later this month in Spain.'Thanks everybody for the love and support,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""I'll be ok and be back better than ever!!! Love y'all!!' The Americans planned to reduce the 20-player pool to 14 or 15 players Saturday, but put off those plans after George's injury. 'Everything's on hold right and it should be,' Krzyzewski said. 'It would be so inappropriate for us to talk about anything else when there's a serious injury like this.' The defending champion U.S. team had already been weakened by player losses. Forwards Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge and NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard had all pulled out in recent weeks. Krzyzewski and Colangelo refused to discuss the roster after the game, saying they didn't even know when they would make roster reductions. 'As an organization, we're just going to let a little bit of time go by here before we address anything like rosters, all that stuff,' Colangelo said. 'It seems so unimportant in the big scheme of things when you have something like this take place. It puts things in perspective.' George would have been a candidate to start for the Americans alongside Kevin Durant. The two, along with Harden, spent the week playing in 1-on-1 competitions after practice, pushing one another while building chemistry leading up to Friday night's game. Assistance: Medical staff attend to the basketball star after his nasty leg break . End: George left the arena on a stretcher and is almost certain to miss the start of the new NBA season . Huddle: The rest of the USA team watch on stunned at what they have just witnessed . George led the Pacers to the best record in the Eastern Conference before they were eliminated by Miami in the Eastern Conference finals. The Americans have to be down to 12 players before they open the tournament on August 30. They are scheduled to take the next week off before reconvening in Chicago for their next practice on August 14. Some NBA executives have long been concerned about injuries to players during summer competitions. Pau Gasol, then playing for the Memphis Grizzlies, broke his foot while leading Spain to the 2006 world title, and Manu Ginobili injured his ankle while playing for Argentina in the 2008 Olympics. He is sitting out the World Cup while recovering from a stress fracture in his right leg. 'Anything can happen anywhere, a lot of things happen,' said Krzyzewski, who was coaching Duke against Louisville when the Cardinals' Kevin Ware broke his leg during the 2013 NCAA tournament. 'Tonight it happened during a basketball game. We need to take care of that,' Krzyzewski said. 'It doesn't mean it'll happen again and again and again; it means that it happened right now.'","Paul George has undergone successful surgery on a broken leg .

"By . Kit Holden . As Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund prepare for their first clash of the new season, relationships between the two clubs could barely be more strained. The two German giants face each other on Wednesday night in the DFL Supercup, Germany's equivalent of the Community Shield. Dortmund's 80,000 seater Westfalenstadion is already sold out, and while the trophy may not be the most prestigious, the ongoing conflict between the two clubs is sure to make the game a heated affair. Dortmund chief executive Hans Joachim Watzke wrote to FC Bayern this weekend, confirming that he and his colleagues will not be sharing a meal with their Munich counterparts on the day of the game. The German Football League had invited both clubs to eat together, but Watzke claims that 'the deep running disharmony' between the two clubs would make such a gesture 'pointless'. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Reus and Hummels take centre stage at Dortmund team photo . Strained relations: Bayern Munich Pep Guardiola (right) and Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp (left) will clash on Wednesday in the DFL Supercup final with relations between the clubs at an all-time low . Anger: Bayern's public pursuit of Dortmund's Marco Reus has led to a bitter war of words between the clubs . Winner: Arjen Robben (centre) scores to give Bayern victory over Dortmund in 2013 Champions League final . Clash: When Bayern meet Dortmund it is always a huge affair and the Supercup will be no different . The latest war of the words between Dortmund and Bayern emerged last week, after Bayern boss Karl-Heinz Rummenigge betrayed his club's desire to sign Dortmund star Marco Reus, and revealed details of Reus' release clause. This prompted Dortmund Director of Sport Michael Zorc to tell Rummenigge to 'keep his mouth shut', before his opposite number at Bayern Matthias Sammer responded by saying 'no one can put a gag on us'. This is not the first conflict between the two clubs who, in recent years, have dominated German football. The touchline scrap between Matthias Sammer and Jürgen Klopp in the spring of 2013 remains fresh in the memory, and with Bayern having signed Mario Götze and Robert Lewandowski from their rivals since then, any civility between the two clubs has disappeared. Some see the mutual distaste between the two sides as a positive though. Ottmar Hitzfeld, who managed both teams to respective Champions League titles, told the Bild on Sunday that 'the verbals don't harm the Bundesliga. I think they're actually quite good. They liven up the league'. Switching allegiance: Robert Lewandowski (left) and Mario Gotze (right) have moved from Dortmund to Bayern . Bitter: Gotze (right) switched clubs in 2013 and Lewandowski (left) followed him across the divide this summer . Rivalry: Guardiola will watch his Bayern team take on Dortmund in a game that promises to be whole-hearted . As for Dortmund's indignation over the Reus affair, Hitzfeld was also quick to defend Bayern. 'There's no reason for Bayern to say 'we won't buy any more Dortmund players'. That would be unrealistic. Bayern want the best team they can get, so they'll sign the best players. Besides, Dortmund signed Reus from Borussia Mönchengladbach in exactly the same way. They used a release clause, just as it seems Bayern will do next summer'. With every man and his wife sticking their oar in, Wednesday's game promises to be an emotional one. On the field, both teams are on the back foot. Pep Guardiola will be missing several players through injury, including Rafinha, Thiago and Franck Ribery. The Bayern players who won the World Cup with Germany, meanwhile, have only just returned to training. 'Some will come back quickly, for others it will take longer' said Guardiola, 'I will ask the doctor who is fit, and make my decisions on that basis'.

After Bastian Schweinsteiger was nearly injured during Bayern's pre-season tour of the USA, though, the Catalan will be unwilling to risk too much on Wednesday. The Supercup has often been used to try out younger players - Liverpool's Emre Can played for Bayern in the fixture two years ago. Reports suggest Guardiola may even give a competitive debut to 17 year old Gianluca Gaudino this time around. Dortmund, meanwhile are looking to recover from a humiliating, if meaningless, 4-0 drubbing to Liverpool at the weekend. Klopp told Ruhrnachrichten that the defeat was merely a case of 'playing the wrong opposition on the wrong day', and said he was confident that 'we will find our rhythm, and then the energy will return too'.

"By . Peter Allen . Updated: . 12:02 EST, 5 March 2012 . The wife of Dominique Strauss-Kahn today launched a furious attack on feminists for trying to ‘dictate to everybody’ how they should live. Anne Sinclair, 63, is standing by the former International Monetary Fund chief as he faces charges of pimping and using corporate funds to pay for prostitutes. Using words which will infuriate thousands of women, Ms Sinclair even suggested that feminism had become a device used to unfairly ‘arrest’ philanderers. Fighting back: Anne Sinclair, right, the wife of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, left, today launched a furious attack on feminists who have criticised her for not leaving her husband . It follows two alleged rape accusations against Mr Strauss Kahn, who still faces civil charges in America after a New York chamber maid accused him of attacking her. But Ms Sinclair, who was today launching a new book about her American art dealer grandfather from who she inherited millions, said coverage of her husband’s legal problems had crossed the boundaries of both ‘voyeurism and the Inquisition’. Suggesting that society was becoming too conservative, Ms Sinclair even blamed economic problems, saying: ‘People are afraid of the future, hence a more moralising tendency. ‘Words themselves are moving away from their meaning, including (the word) feminism. Feminism is the struggle for women’s freedom. Accusations: Nafissatou Diallo, pictured, performed a sex act on Mr Strauss-Kahn in New York last May and has accused him of 'sadistic and violent' behaviour . ‘Self-proclaimed feminists have turned it into an arresting machine to dictate to everyone how we should live.’ Women like Nafissatou Diallo, the 32-year-old who performed a sex act on Mr Strauss-Kahn in New York last May, have accused him of ‘sadistic and violent’ behaviour. French judges also found evidence that he had sexually assaulted Tristane Banon, a 32-year-old writer, in a Paris flat, but could not prosecute because the alleged attack happened so long ago. Some 10 prostitutes have, meanwhile said they had sex at well planned orgies with Mr Strauss-Kahn, who has always denied all the charges against him, saying he simply enjoyed a ‘liberal’ sex life. Ms Sinclair has frequently expressed her anger at women who say she should leave Strauss-Kahn, even comparing him to Alfred Dreyfus,  a Jewish army officer who was persecuted by the French establishment at the end of the 19th Century. Ms Sinclair made her latest comments in Paris, where she was promoting her new book about her grandfather Paul Rosenberg, who made millions dealing in works produced by artists including Pablo Picasso.","Anne Sinclair says feminism has become a device used to unfairly 'arrest' philanderers .

"By . Tracey Cox . One quarter (24 per cent) of people have had an affair and cheated on a partner at some point in their lives, according to results released today. Perhaps not surprisingly, 24 per cent of people surveyed (by Relate and Relationships Scotland in The Way we Are Now study of 5000 people) also said they were dissatisfied with their sex lives. It's disturbing news and something a lot of happy couples will skip over, not wanting to spend any longer than necessary with the unwanted image of a much-loved partner having sex with someone else. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tracey says that a quarter of us are having affairs despite the fact that a two thirds of us believe that it will destroy our relationship . My advice would be if you want to affair-proof your relationship, don't look away. Do the opposite and instead face the fact that one or both of you might be tempted in the future - even if you don't really want to be. Contrary to popular perception, the majority of people who have an affair don't want to have one. Given the choice between feeling utterly sexually satisfied with a partner you love or sneaking around behind their back, feeling guilty and knowing you’re risking your marriage, kids and future happiness for a bit of argy-pargy, any sane person would choose the former. Sure, once an affair has started there’s a pleasure rush, with all those love and sex hormones reignited by the novelty and excitement of fresh flesh. Not so appealing, however, when you come home to find your partner ashen faced, your bags packed and your kids sobbing in their bedrooms, wondering why Daddy or Mummy are going away for a while. Some of us (22 per cent of men and 13 per cent of women) might entertain the idea of having an affair ourselves on occasion - but no-one wants to be the one left home alone. Another sobering statistic from the survey was while a whopping 94 per cent of counsellors and sex therapists think a relationship can survive an affair, only a third of the public agree. Two-thirds of us believe they’re the death knell. Yet despite knowing how damaging they are, the human race has been having affairs almost as long as we have having relationships and continue to do so. The question is - why? Esther Perel, psychologist and world respected authority on sex and relationships, believes expecting our partners to satisfy our every need is a big part of the problem. In the old days, we got married for economic reasons, companionship and to bring up children.Friends, bosses, parents and other people in the community took care of other needs like entertainment, advice, or providing hobbies and interests. Now we expect 'one person to do the job of a whole village,' says Esther. 'We want our partners to also be our best friend, trusted confidante, passionate lover - and we live twice as long!' Tracey says try spending time away from your partner as distance really does make the heart grow fonder . The other problem is that we want two very different things from one relationship . We want love and we want sex. The 'love side' wants security and predictability to make us feel safe. Our 'sex side' wants novelty and adventure to make us feel alive and excited. It's a big - some might say impossible - ask to get all of our often conflicting needs met by the same person. Why is why we're tempted to invite a third person into the relationship and have an affair. Living together - what most people in love do - is also a desire killer . We most want what we can’t and don’t have and if our partner is lying beside us every single night, their high availability puts them low on the desire scale. If we had to step over a pile of diamonds every time we stepped outside our front door, they would cease to be precious stones. Ironically, the very model of monogamy doesn’t help prevent affairs - in lots of senses it encourages them. But there are ways to beat the system and remain happily monogamous and faithful. Here's how to affair proof your relationship: . Tracey says try watching your partner when they are most happy and you will find them more attractive . Spend time apart . Don’t be Tweedledum and Tweedledee and do everything together. Don’t merge, stay as two, separate individuals. Wave your partner off to do their stuff while you go off to do yours. Absence makes us desire someone more. This is why affairs are so powerful sexually. The person usually isn’t always available to us. We see them sparingly, not 24/7. Watch your partner when they are at their best . We are at our most attractive when we are doing what we love. It might be our job, playing a sport, telling a story, cooking a meal. When we feel happiest, we're the most confident and attractive. Look at your partner through a stranger's eyes . Don’t just watch them when they’re at their best. Watch other people watching them. This isn’t easy. Seeing a worrying attractive person checking out your partner is uncomfortable: it makes you feel insecure and suddenly threatened. It also makes you appreciate that it’s not just you that finds them attractive, making them suddenly a lot more attractive to you. Give up forever on the spontaneity myth . The biggest, most harmful myth about love and sex is that you’ll suddenly just feel like sex ten years into your relationship and if you don’t, you either aren’t in love or don’t fancy your partner.Rubbish. Spontaneous desire happens at the start but couples who are still enjoying great sex years in, create desire. They work out what turns each other on and do it. Desire might seem like it magically appears but they've made it happen.

"By . Sarah Dean For Daily Mail Australia . A teenager whose passport has been cancelled on security grounds turned up to a TV discussion about Australians fighting in Syria wearing an Islamic State flag symbol and then dramatically stormed out. Abu Bakr, 19, who is on the radar of security services, walked off set during an SBS Insight episode due to be shown on Tuesday night. The teenager, who was born in Australia but has an Italian and Iraqi background, turned up to the discussion wearing an Islamic State flag logo on his black jacket. Bakr thinks Muslims are obligated help fellow Muslims overseas and reportedly does not feel connected with his home country of Australia. Scroll down for video . Abu Bakr, 19, appeared on the SBS Insight episode due to be shown on Tuesday night . He said 'in order for me to be connected to the values here of Australia, the Australian government needs to stop picking on the Muslims here.' As the TV discussion, fronted by journalist Jenny Brockie, turned to the issue of passports being cancelled his lawyer Zali Burrows and the show's producer began to knock heads. Burrows told Daily Mail Australia her client left because 'the whole set up was a farce and they duped guests as to the theme'. 'Then again perhaps we should not be worried as nobody watches SBS unless they are looking for soft porn on a Friday night.' she added. Burrows said she and Bakr were told the discussion would be about the new anti-terror laws announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott last week. Instead she said they spent two 'boring' hours talking about fighting in Syria and the Islamic State organisation. 'He was like a lamb brought to slaughter... he's a young kid who's passionate about injustice,' Burrows said of her client. She did not comment when asked why Bakr's passport was revoked. The teenager turned up to the discussion wearing an Islamic State flag on his black jacket . Journalist Jenny Brockie probed him about his passport being revoked . The SBS show on Tuesday night also includes appearances from other staunch supporters of the Islamic State, formerly known as ISIS, as well as worried family members. Australian Mohamed Zuhbi appeared on the show from Turkey, via Skype, and claimed he is doing humanitarian work in Syria but has not been part of the fighting. The man, who was born in Syria but grew up in Australia from the age of one, said: 'I believe that [Islamic State] are the future of Syria and I believe that they're the future of the Islamic empire to come.' Abdul Salam Mahmoud, an Australian citizen who is currently in Latakia in Syria, also said he's there doing humanitarian work. Australian Mohamed Zuhbi (left) appeared on the show from Turkey, via Skype, and claimed he is doing humanitarian work in Syria. Abdul Salam Mahmoud (right), an Australian citizen who is currently in Latakia in Syria, also said he's doing humanitarian work. 'We give monthly payments to families who have orphans and widows and we give them food packages,' he said. 'In Islam we're obligated. Wherever our people are being harmed or being oppressed it's an obligation for us to go and help them to fight tyranny and to fight oppression.' A Melbourne father, who does not wish to be identified, told how his 17-year-old son had become radicalised, grown a long beard and constantly talks about the war between Islamic denominations the Shias and Sunnis. 'I'm worried... he wants to go to Syria and join those groups and he kill some innocent peopleand he (might) die himself,' Abdullah told Insight. 'He's quiet and depressed.' The show was filmed after it emerged there are around 60 Australians fighting in Syria at the moment . Abdullah, who migrated to Australia from Afghanistan, explained: 'I don't know where he get brainwashed, where he's been taught like this to do these things.' The show was filmed after it emerged there are around 60 Australians fighting in Syria at the moment. Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said the Federal Government is 'deeply concerned' about what will happen when they Australians return home. 'We are deeply concerned that this domestic security challenge will mean that Australiancitizens fighting in these conflicts overseas will return to this country as hardened home-grown terrorists who may use their experience, the skills that they've gained, to carry out an attack in this country,' she said. Sheikh Mohamadu Saleem (left), the spokesperson of the Australian National Imams Council, said imams are trying to engage with young men to give religious advice and explain that it is not the duty of Australian Muslims to fight overseas. Rodger Shanahan (right), who has served with the United Nations in South Lebanon and Syria, said we need to get to the bottom of why people are going to Syria . This is has led to new counter terrorism laws and a $630 million boost to spy and counter-terror agencies being pledged by Prime Minister Tony Abbott last week. The anti-terror measures include stronger powers for authorities to detain and question jihadists who have fought alongside terrorists overseas in countries like Syria and Iraq. Dozens of Australians' passports have also now been cancelled and arrest warrants have been issued for Sydney-born jihadists Mohamed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf who are currently fighting in Syria. Khaled Sharrouf, a former Sydney resident, is thought to be fighting with al-Qaeda off-shoot Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Security agencies believe he left Australia using his brother's passport in December, and he will be arrested on terrorism-related charges if he ever returns to Australia. Former Sydney boxer Mohamed Elomar has also fled to Syria where he was recently pictured holding up two decapitated heads in an image posted on Twitter by Sharrouf . Sheikh Mohamadu Saleem, the spokesperson of the Australian National Imams Council, appeared on the Insight show and said imams are trying to engage with young men to give religious advice and explain that it is not the duty of Australian Muslims to fight overseas. 'There is a very small number of people... who are not listening,' he admitted. 'But the large number of people who are in schools, in the universities, doing the right thing, they are listening.' Meanwhile, Rodger Shanahan, who has served with the United Nations in South Lebanon and Syria and is now affiliated with the Lowy Institute, said we need to get to the bottom of why people are going to Syria. He claimed those who Australians who have been killed in the conflict were not particularly well educated.

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Rather than splash out on a lavish white wedding, one couple from Kent decided to 'make do and mend' by taking inspiration from the 1940s. Julie Parker, 54, and Andy Kennet, 44, celebrated their nuptials at the War and Peace Revival event in Folkestone. The event is the largest gathering of . military vehicles in the world and the area is decked out in 1940's decor. Vintage: Julie Parker and Andy Kennet celebrated their nuptials at the War and Peace Revival in Kent . Dressed for the era: The bride wore a white lace dress while Andy appeared in a 12 corps coastal defence Royal Artillery uniform . Authentic experience: The guests were also asked to wear Forties-style clothes and eat food that would have been available at the time . The vintage festival is held every year and the World War Two fanatics knew it would be the perfect place for them to exchange vows. The venue has a small replica village of a . war town which includes a home front office, a police station, shops . and a village green with tea room. Julie and Andy could think of nowhere . better for their big day, and invited 100 guests to their wedding, even stating it would be held in July 1941 on their invitations. Mum-of-one Julie wore a white lace dress while Andy appeared in a 12 corps coastal defence Royal Artillery uniform. Guest of honour: World War Two veteran Albert Figg, 96, joined the newly weds . Celebration and remembrance: The couple were delighted the veteran could attend . Now Mr and Mrs: Julie said, 'it was absolutely amazing. It was a very different wedding' Their guests were asked to wear 1940s dress and to bring simple food, which would have only been available in the forties thanks to rationing, such as pickles and hams. Former policewoman Julie and Andy, who is a technician who restores military vehicles, were married on the village green by a registrar who wore top hat and tails. Julie said: 'It was absolutely amazing. It was a very different wedding. I wanted the whole atmosphere to take them back to that period. 'I scattered the simple sheet table clothes with war leaflets and made jam jar candles so everything was of the time. 'It was the best day ever. As soon as Andy proposed to me we knew we would get married there. Every year we went and said someone should get married here but at the time we never thought it would be us. Perfect venue: The couple have long been fans of the annual War and Peace Revival . Pastime: The bride and groom sign the register in a 1940s memorabilia decked room . Flash back: The couple try to replicate the era further with this old black and white style photo . 'I had a lot of people texting me before the event asking what they should wear and worrying about it but on the day everyone just looked fantastic.' The couple also hired a 20-piece jazz band who played into the night as guests sat around candle-lit tables in a canvas marquee. Also attending the event was Albert Figg, 96, a World War Two veteran who was invited as a guest of honour. Andy said: 'There was no better place to get married than the show I've been going to for the past 10 years. 'We both wanted to remember the men that fought for our country and hoped our guests would appreciate the history of the wars that are gradually fading from people's memories. 'The icing on the cake was seeing Albert Figg a man I have great respect for.'","Julie Parker and Andy Kennet were married at the War and Peace Revival .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . For years scientists have debated whether an asteroid, climate change or a combination of catastrophes were responsible for the demise of dinosaurs. Now experts believe that the majority of the prehistoric creatures were wiped out by a perfect storm of ‘colossal bad luck’. Dinosaurs might have survived the asteroid strike that led to their extinction if it had come slightly earlier or later in history, they said. Dinosaurs might have survived the asteroid strike that led to their extinction (illu8strated) if it had come slightly earlier or later in history. Experts say that the creatures were killed by 'colossal bad luck' as they were already weakened by a changing climate and did not have time to adapt . But when the six-mile-wide (10km) asteroid hit what is now Mexico approximately 66 million years ago, dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval, which left them vulnerable. The new study by an international team of palaeontologists led by the University of Edinburgh looked at an updated catalogue of dinosaur fossils, mostly from North America. They found that widespread volcanic activity, changing sea levels and varying temperatures had weakened the dinosaurs’ food chain when disaster struck. If the asteroid impact had come a few million years earlier, when the range of species was bigger and food chains more robust, they may have survived, according to the study, which was published in the journal Biological Reviews. When the six-mile-wide (10km) asteroid hit what is now Mexico approximately 66 million years ago (illustrated) dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval such as changing temperatures and chains of volcanic activity, which left them vulnerable, according to the new study . Many scientists agree that a six-mile-wide (10km) asteroid that struck what is now Mexico 66 million years ago, led to the dying of the majority of dinosaurs. The new study says that if it had struck a few million years earlier or later, prehistoric creatures such as the T.Rex may have survived. Experts studied fossils to find that widespread volcanic activity, changing sea levels and varying temperatures had weakened the dinosaurs’ food chain when disaster struck. If the asteroid impact had come a few million years earlier, when the range of species was bigger and food chains more robust, they may have survived. Likewise, if it had come later in history when new species had been given the chance to evolve, they might have escaped extinction. But when the asteroid struck - causing tsunamis, earthquakes, wildfires, sudden temperature swings and other environmental changes - the already weakened dinosaur kingdom was wiped out one species after another. Likewise, if it had come later in history when new species had been given the chance to evolve, they might have escaped extinction. But when the asteroid struck - causing tsunamis, earthquakes, wildfires, sudden temperature swings and other environmental changes - the already weakened dinosaur kingdom was wiped out one species after another. The only dinosaurs to survive were those that could fly, which evolved to become the birds of today. Dr Steve Brusatte, of the University of Edinburgh’s School of Geo Sciences, said: ‘The dinosaurs were victims of colossal bad luck. ‘Not only did a giant asteroid strike, but it happened at the worst possible time, when their ecosystems were vulnerable. ‘Our new findings help clarify one of the enduring mysteries of science.’ Dr Richard Butler, from the University of Birmingham, said there was nothing to suggest that dinosaurs were doomed to extinction when the asteroid hit. ‘Without that asteroid, the dinosaurs would probably still be here, and we very probably would not,’ he added. It is hoped that that ongoing studies in Spain and China will aid even better understanding of what occurred.","A study led by the University of Edinburgh says the dinosaurs may have survived if the asteroid struck several million years earlier or later .

"By . Damien Gayle . Scientists have developed a solid material so light it can be balanced atop the petals of a flower. Researchers from Zhejiang university in Hangzhou, China, showed off their newly developed graphene aerogel by balancing a block of the stuff on a delicate cherry blossom. The sponge-like matter is made of freeze-dried carbon and graphene oxide and is the lightest solid material in the world. The lightest solid ever developed: A piece of graphene aerogel developed in a lab at Zhejiang University is placed on a cherry flower in Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang province . Delicate: A comparison with this researcher's hand reveals just how puny the flower is - yet it can comfortably hold the weight of the graphene substance balanced on top of it . With a weight of just 0.16 miligrams per cubic centimeter, it is just twice the density of hydrogen - the simplest of all elements - and less dense than helium. First developed by two Russian scientists playing about with Scotch tape at Manchester University, graphene has already been hailed as a 'wonder material' that promises to transform the future. Its discovery earned Professors Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov a joint Nobel prize in physics, with the committee making a special mention of the 'playfulness' of their experiments, and a knighthood each. Wondrous: A researcher lifts a piece of graphene aerogel by the static electricity on the glass stick in a lab at Zhejiang University. The sponge-like matter is made of freeze-dried carbon and graphene oxide . Superlight: Gao Chao, professor of the Department of Polymer Science and Engineering at Zhejiang University, displays the newly-developed ultra-light solid material . In its pure state, the substance is a two-dimensional crystal of pure carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice described by some as 'atomic chickenwire'. That makes it the thinnest material ever made. You would need to stack three million graphene sheets on top of each other to get a pile one milimetre high. But this unique structure makes it very light and strong, with a one-square-metre sheet weighing only 0.77 milligrams - yet strong enough to support the weight of a 4kg adult cat. A sheet of graphene as thin as clingfilm could hold the weight of an elephant. According to one calculation, an Nelly would need to balance precariously on the end of a pencil to break through that same sheet. Despite its strength, it is also extremely flexible and can be stretched by 20 per cent without any damage, and it's almost transparent. It is also a superb conductor of electricity — far better than copper, traditionally used for wiring — and is the best conductor of heat on the planet. It is also, further research discovered, an incredible filter - it blocks all liquids and gases except water, which made for the potential for one stereotypically Russian experiment by its inventors. 'Just for a laugh, we sealed a bottle of vodka with our membranes and found that the distilled solution became stronger and stronger with time,' said Dr Rahul Nair, who co-authored a study describing the results last year. Atomic chickenwire: In its pure state, the substance is a two-dimensional crystal of pure carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice. That makes it the thinnest material ever made, yet 200 times stronger than steel . Professors Geim and Novoselov serendipitously discovered graphene almost by accident while investigating the electrical properties of carbon graphite - the common material that pencils are made of. Borrowing a technique used by microscopy researchers to clean the mineral before examining it close up, they found they could peel it into ever thinner flakes using Scotch tape. After repeatedly sticking and peeling back the Scotch tape they realised they could get down to the thinnest layer physically possible - just one atom thick. They then attached it to a silicon plate which allowed them to identify its tiny layers through a microscope. Professors Andre Geim (left) and Kostya Novoselov: Discovering graphene in the course of research at Manchester University earned the pair a joint Nobel prize in physics and a knighthood each . Graphene's discovery has triggered a boom for material science, with its potential applications appearing almost limitless. But most important of all, its core constituent, carbon, is the basic element of life, which means graphene could spur a new industrial revolution based on components that are biodegradable and sustainable. ‘We are talking of a number of unique properties combined in one material which probably hasn’t happened before,’ said Professor Novoselov in 2011. ‘You might want to compare it to plastic. But graphene is as versatile as all the plastics put together. ‘It’s a big claim, but it’s not bold. That’s exactly why there are so many researchers working on it.’","Chinese researchers showed off their graphene aerogel by balancing it on the petals of a cherry blossom .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . More signs that there was once water on Mars have been uncovered by a Nasa rover. A rock crushed under the Curiosity Mars rover's wheels split open to reveal a dazzling white interior - a sign that it contains hydrated minerals, formed when water flowed through it, scientists say. Powder drilled from a Martian rock last week revealed evidence of drinkable water and conditions favourable to life. Now instruments on the rover have found more water-bearing minerals in the area around the rock. NASA images of a rock known as 'Tintina' broken under one of the Mars rover Curiosity's wheels reveals its striking white interior. Powder drilled from Martian rocks has revealed evidence of drinkable water and conditions favourable to life . Water-bearing minerals in Tintina and elsewhere have added to a list of water evidence at the area. Curiosity is exploring a region within Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, called Yellowknife Bay. Scientists believe that billions of years ago water poured down the rim of the crater and formed streams that might have been up to three feet deep. The new discoveries were made using the infrared imaging capability of Curiosity's mast camera, and an instrument that shoots neutron particles into the ground to probe for hydrogen. Differences in brightness between near-infrared wavelengths of light can indicate the presence of some hydrated minerals that have been altered by water. An image captured by the Mast Camera (Mastcam) on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity revealing interesting internal color in this rock which was broken by Curiosity when it drove over it . Water-bearing minerals in Tintina and elsewhere have added to a list of water evidence at the area . 'With Mastcam, we see elevated hydration signals in the narrow veins that cut many of the rocks in this area,' said Dr Melissa Rice, from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 'These bright veins contain hydrated minerals that are different from the clay minerals in the surrounding rock matrix.' The Russian-made Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) instrument detected hydrogen in water molecules bound into minerals in the soil beneath the rover. The rock is made up of a fine-grained mudstone containing clay minerals, sulfate minerals and other chemicals. The patch of bedrock where Curiosity drilled for its first sample lies in an ancient network of stream channels descending from the rim of Gale Crater. This ancient wet environment, unlike some others on Mars, was not harshly oxidizing, acidic or extremely salty. The bedrock also is fine-grained mudstone and shows evidence of multiple periods of wet conditions, including nodules and veins. Yellowknife Bay contained more water than other areas previously visited by Curiosity, the results showed. 'More water is detected at Yellowknife Bay than earlier on the route,' said DAN deputy principal investigator Dr Maxim Litvak, from the Space Research Institute in Moscow. 'Even within Yellowknife Bay, we see significant variation.' The findings were presented at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas. Just last week Nasa announced that analysis of a rock sample collected by the rover found key chemical ingredients that show Mars could once have supported primitive life. Scientists identified sulphur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon - some of the key chemical ingredients for life - in the powder Curiosity drilled out of a sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed. The data indicated the Yellowknife Bay area the rover is exploring was the end of an ancient river system or an intermittently wet lake bed that could have provided chemical energy and other favourable conditions for microbes.'We have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life, that probably if this water was around and you had been there, you would have been able to drink it,' said project scientist John Grotzinger at the time.Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program at the agency's headquarters in Washington, added: 'A fundamental question for this mission is whether Mars could have supported a habitable environment. 'From what we know now, the answer is yes.'","Curiosity is exploring a region within Gale Crater, near the Martian equator .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . and Jonathan O'Callaghan . Less than a week before Rosetta's meets up with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, images taken by the spacecraft have revealed remarkable new features. The latest images were taken by Osiris, the spacecraft's onboard scientific imaging system, on the July 25, at a distance of around 1,950km (1200 miles). One image shows the coma, which is the dust and gas envelope that grows around its nucleus as the comet moves along its orbit and progressively closer to the sun. This image shows the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimernko from 1,210 miles (1,950 kilometers). One pixel in this image corresponds to approximately 120ft (37 metres). The bright neck region between the comet's head and body is becoming increasingly distinct as Rosetta approaches and its view improves . Another reveals that the comet is far more irregular in shape than anyone first thought. It has already been named the ‘rubber duck’ in space. 'Our coma images cover an area of 150 by 150 square kilometres (90 by 90 square miles),' said Luisa Lara from the Institute of Astrophysics in Andalusia, Spain. Most likely these images show only the inner part of the coma, where particle densities are highest. Scientist expect that 67P's full coma actually reaches much farther. In the current image, the hazy, bright, circular structure to the right of the comet's nucleus is an artefact of the Osiris optical system. The coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as seen with Osiris covers an area of 90 miles (150km) across. This image was taken on July 25th, with an exposure time of 330 seconds. The hazy circular structure on the right and the centre of the coma are caused by overexposure of the nucleus . Images of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko taken on July 14, 2014, by the Osiris imaging system aboard the Rosetta spacecraft have allowed scientists to create this three-dimensional shape model of the nucleus . The centre of the image located around the position of the nucleus is overexposed here. One pixel in this image corresponds to approximately 120ft (37 metres). The image also reveals some surface features of the 4km (2.5 mile)-wide comet, from a few troughs and mounds to the previously-noted bright band around the ‘neck’. Its nucleus has a collar-like appearance of the neck region, which appears brighter than most parts of the comet's body and head. Earlier this month, remarkable photos have showed that its target, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is actually what is known as a ‘contact binary’. This means it is likely two comets stitched together, in what could turn out to be both a blessing and a curse. It could have been fractured in the past or it could be two different objects that very slowly came into contact at speeds of a few metres per second. Stunning images of the comet Rosetta is heading towards were released last month. Shown here, they reveal that the comet previously thought to be a single object actually has two parts. How these two parts came to be is not known, but more information will be gleaned in the next few months . A contact binary occurs when two celestial objects, such as asteroids or comets, slowly move towards each other until they are touching. The slow approach of the two means they will form a single-oddly shaped body, rather than rebounding of one another. Nine near-Earth objects are known to be contact binaries. However, it is estimated that as many as 15 per cent of all near-Earth asteroids more than 650 feet (200 metres) in size are actually contact binaries. What is certain, though, is that it poses some intriguing problems for Rosetta. The most notable will be the planning landing of the Philae probe on its surface in November. This will be the first cometary landed ever attempted - but now a decision will be made on what part of the comet to land on. Regardless, Rosetta is still planning to enter orbit around the comet on Wednesday 6 August. The orbit will gradually be lowered to 19 miles (30 kilometres) once the gravitational field of the comet is known - which could be more odd than expected given its shape. According to Philae navigator Eric Jurado, ‘navigation around such a body should not be much more complex than around a nucleus of irregular spherical type.’ But, he adds, ‘landing the Philae probe, however, could be more difficult, as this form restricts potential landing zones.’ The images taken by Rosetta reveal a two-lobed comet rather than the single comet expected. This could make a planned landing in November by the Philae probe more difficult. Rosetta is due to enter orbit on 6 August after ten years of travel, when more will be known about the comet . Speaking to MailOnline Pedro Lacerda, astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research and part of the team analysing results of the Rosetta mission, said: '67P does seem to be made of two lumps. 'On one hand this is unexpected, because the shape model we had based on observations from Earth didn’t predict a binary structure. That just highlights the importance of these missions - they tell us more. 'On the other hand, three of the five comets previously visited by spacecraft seem to be composed of two chunks too, so it could be that binary comets are quite common. 'Now we need to find out what this is telling us. Is this a result of the way comets form, or is it a consequence of their evolution? 'Hopefully, Rosetta will point us to the answer. The Kuiper belt, where this comet is believe to originate, seems to have a very high fraction of binaries, up to 30 per cent depending on where you look, which is also interesting. 'It could be that many of these objects start out as binaries. 'In terms of the landing, I think the binary shape just raises more interesting questions. 'Where do we land so that we maximise the science return? Technically, it probably does not change much. The landing will be challenging no matter what.' The Rosetta spacecraft launched in 2004 on a mission to study comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (artist's illustration shown). It will rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in August, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet . Rosetta will seek to help scientists unlock the . composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and . evolution of our solar system. The . probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five . times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its . final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. For . the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out . towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space . hibernation. Rosetta will enter orbit around the comet in August, before putting its Philae lander onto the comet’s . surface in November. While . in orbit it will perform extensive analysis of the comet's composition, . which will provide us with an insight into the history of the solar . system and discover the origin of comets. Rosetta has been firing its thrusters to cut by almost two thirds the speed with which it's hurtling towards the comet. There will be a total of four before Rosetta comes . within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of the comet in early August, beyond . the orbit of Mars. The final rendezvous will require two more precision maneuvers. The probe, launched a decade ago, will spend time observing 67P before dropping a lander called Philae onto its icy surface in November. If the Philae . lander is successful it will become the first vehicle ever to land on a . comet. The comet is about 2.5 miles (four kilometres) long and orbits the sun every six-and-a-half years. Once . at the comet Rosetta will follow it on its journey around the sun, . performing extensive studies of the coma and the surface. The . spacecraft's speed will be slowed in order to remain in orbit, bringing . it to roughly about walking pace relative to the comet. In November of this year the Philae lander will be sent to touch down on the surface of the comet (artist's illustration shown), which will be the first landing ever performed on a comet. Here, harpoons will be fired into the surface to keep it anchored while it studies its surroundings . The comet is heading towards the sun, so as it nears the star it will begin to melt more. Even . though it is still more than 370 million miles (600 million kilometres) from the sun - more than four times the distance between Earth and sun - . its surface has already started to warm, causing its ices to turn to . gas and escape from its rock-ice nucleus. As the gas escapes, it also carries a cloud of tiny dust particles out into space, which slowly expands to create the coma. The . warming will continue as the comet moves closer to the sun and activity . rises, and pressure from the solar wind will eventually cause some of . the material to stream out into a long tail. This will give Rosetta some fascinating opportunities to observe the comet's emissions and find out more about its composition. Rosetta and the comet will be closest to the sun in August 2015, when they will be between the orbits of Earth and Mars. On 25 Feb 2007 The Rosetta spacecraft returned this stunning image of Mars as it flew past the red planet on its way to the comet. The picture was taken by an imaging instrument on the Philae lander at a distance of 620 miles (1,000 kilometres). Below the solar array an area close to the Syrtis region is visible on the planet's disk .","One image shows the coma, which is the dust and gas envelope that grows around its nucleus as the comet moves along its orbit closer to the sun .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Futuristic cityscapes featuring soaring skyscrapers, flying cars and all-seeing video screens are popular features of sci-fi films. And now one artist has imagined how that reality would affect Paris and New York in less than a century. Gone are Paris’ breezy boulevards and grand open spaces and New York’s elegant Art Deco buildings. Instead grimy streets are lined by sinister 'atmosphere-scraper' buildings, while the cities' inhabitants live in cramped conditions. Scare Bleu! One artist has imagined what Paris and New York might look like in less than 100 year¿s time. This terrifying vision of the future shows the view to the Eiffel Tower. Gone are the open gardens and boulevards by the Seine, which have been replaced by towering grey skyscrapers and complex-looking covered roads . A matter of time? In the illustrations, massive metal buildings dwarfing landmarks such as Sacre Coeur and the Eiffel Tower feature, while Times Square in New York (pictured)looks like it has fallen on hard times in the dystopian vision of the future . Enormous industrial buildings give out a cold fluorescent light, dwarfing landmarks such as Sacre Coeur and the Eiffel Tower, while Times Square looks like it has fallen on hard times in a dystopian vision of the future. The images were dreamed up by French concept designer Paul Chadeisson, who works in the French capital for a videogame company called Dontnod Entertainment. He has created futuristic cityscapes for the game Remember Me, as well as artwork for films and books, all of which show incredible attention to detail. Not so triumphant: The images were dreamed up by French concept designer Paul Chadeisson who works in the French capital for a videogame company called Dontnod Entertainment. Here, the Arc de Triomphe has been turned into some sort of look-out with wires snaking over it .

While the cityscapes appear at first glance to be impressive and technologically advanced, there are few trees and rubbish strewn across roads, with wires exposed to provide electricity to ramshackle house. Here, Sacre Coeur peeps over the neglected buildings, complete with what looks like some sort of roadblock . Among the run-down buildings it is still possible to see signatures of the cities. For example, Paris retains some of its grand 17th century buildings and famous cafes. But they are largely neglected and littered with neon signs, overlooked by large metal factories, indicating the city will be more densely populated in the future. Mr Chadeisson’s illustrations of the city are set in 2084 and he writes in a blog post that in the city, which is penned for a video game, augmented reality and memory manipulation have taken control of Parisians’ lives. In 'Neo Paris', ‘you can now digitise, buy, sell or trade you own personal memories. The last remainders of intimacy have been swept away, in what appears to be a simple extension of the development of social networks and geolocation at the beginning of the 21st century’ he says.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Earth’s diameter is said to be 7,918 miles (12,727 km), but how does that compare to planets outside our solar system? Until now, astronomers have relied on estimations to determine the magnitude of alien worlds - but a new method has enabled them to make the most accurate size calculation for an exoplanet to date. The planet in question is Kepler-93b, and scientists claim it has a diameter of 11,700 miles (18,800 kilometres) - plus or minus 150 miles (240 kilometres). Researchers in Washington say Kepler-93b is 1.481 times the size of Earth (illustration shown). The accurate measurement was made with two NASA telescopes. These measurements confirm the planet is what's known as a super-Earth . To make the key measurement about this exoplanet's radius, the Kepler and Spitzer telescopes each watched Kepler-93b cross, or transit, the face of its star, eclipsing a tiny portion of starlight. Kepler's unflinching gaze also simultaneously tracked the dimming of the star caused by seismic waves moving within its interior. These readings encode precise information about the star's interior. The team leveraged them to narrowly gauge the star's radius, which is crucial for measuring the planetary radius. Spitzer, meanwhile, confirmed that the exoplanet's transit looked the same in infrared light as in Kepler's visible-light observations. Taken together, the data boast an error bar of just one per cent of the radius of Kepler-93b. The measurements mean that the planet, estimated at about 11,700 miles (18,800 kilometers) in diameter, could be bigger or smaller by about 150 miles (240 kilometers). This is almost one-and-a-half times the size of our planet, making Kepler-93b officially a super-Earth. Scientists made the measurements using Nasa’s Kepler and Spitzer Space Telescopes. The size of the exoplanet is now known to an uncertainty of just 74 miles (119 kilometres) on either side of the planetary body. Although super-Earths are common in the galaxy, none exist in our solar system. Exoplanets like Kepler-93b are therefore an ideal target to study this major class of planet. With good limits on the sizes and masses of super-Earths, scientists can finally start to theorise about what makes up these worlds. Previous measurements, by the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, had put Kepler-93b's mass at about 3.8 times that of Earth. The density of Kepler-93b, derived from its mass and newly-obtained radius, indicates the planet is in fact very likely made of iron and rock, like Earth. 'With Kepler and Spitzer, we've captured the most precise measurement to date of an alien planet's size, which is critical for understanding these far-off worlds,' said Dr Sarah Ballard, a Nasa Carl Sagan Fellow at the University of Washington in Seattle and lead author of a paper on the findings published in the Astrophysical Journal. 'The measurement is so precise that it's literally like being able to measure the height of a six-foot tall person to within three quarters of an inch - if that person were standing on Jupiter,' said Ballard. To make the key measurement about this exoplanet's radius, the Kepler and Spitzer (illustration shown) telescopes each watched Kepler-93b cross, or transit, the face of its star, eclipsing a tiny portion of starlight. Taken together, this data has an error bar of just one per cent of the radius of Kepler-93b . Kepler-93b orbits a star located around 300 light-years away, with approximately 90 per cent of the sun's mass and radius. The exoplanet's orbital distance - only about one-sixth that of Mercury's from the sun - implies a scorching surface temperature around 760°C (1,400°F). Despite its newfound similarities in composition to Earth, Kepler-93b is far too hot for life. 'Ballard and her team have made a major scientific advance while demonstrating the power of Spitzer's new approach to exoplanet observations,' said Dr Michael Werner, project scientist for the Spitzer Space Telescope at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California.","Researchers in Washington say Kepler-93b is 1.481 times the size of Earth .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . How many people would humanity need to send on an interstellar voyager to ensure the survival of a colony beyond the solar system? According to one expert the answer is a staggering 20,000 to 40,000 people. A study suggests that, in order to ensure significant genetic diversity, such large numbers will be needed if any space colony is to survive a trip lasting 150 years. Dr Smith from Portland State University says a future interstellar mission would only work if a large human colony was taken along for the trip on a large starship (illustration of a 'stanford torus', a proposed design for a space habitat made in the 1970s, pictured). The ideal number would be a population of 40,000 . Dr Cameron Smith is an anthropologist and prehistorian at Portland State University in Oregon, and is also involved with Icarus Interstellar, an organisation dedicated to advancing interstellar starship research and development. At Icarus he is working on Project Hyperion, a study of the various factors at play for a future deep space mission - including the number of humans to take. The 100-year Starship Project is a joint endeavour run by Darpa, Nasa, Icarus Interstellar and the Foundation for Enterprise Development. Announced in January 2012, the project has an overall goal of achieving manned interstellar travel by 2112. To do so it is evaluating a number of different techonolgies, including ‘warping’ space time to travel great distances in short time frames at faster-than-light speeds. The project is also considering building ‘generation ships’ that move slowly but have a self-sustainable long-term population. To date Nasa has contributed $100,000 (£60,000) to the project and Darpa $1 million (£600,000). And in a paper published Acta Astronautica he describes how taking less than 20,000 people on an interstellar voyage would be ‘risky’ over multiple generations. ‘Designing interstellar starships for human migration to exoplanets requires establishing the starship population, which factors into many variables including closed-ecosystem design, architecture, mass and propulsion,’ Dr Smith writes. He continues: ‘I find that previously proposed such populations, on the order of a few hundred individuals, are significantly too low to consider based on current understanding of vertebrate (including human) genetics and population dynamics.’ He says that having an ‘Interstellar Migrant Population’ of 40,000, 23,400 of which are ‘reproductive males and females,’ would be a good figure to ensure the health of a colony travelling for 150 years, or five generations. Such a number of people is necessary to avoid interbreeding among the relatively small human population according to Dr Smith. The study considered a hypothetical 150-year mission to a neighbouring star. Increasing spacecraft speeds by a factor of 1,000 would make a mission to a star such as Proxima Centuari (shown with date the distance was calculated) possible, which is 4.24 light years away . Pictured is an illustration of the IXS Enterprise, an interstellar ship envisaged by Nasa's Dr Harold White that could use warp technology to travel 'faster than light'. It could be an accurate representation of what the first mission beyond the solar system will look like . During a talk for Nasa’s Future In-Space Operations, Dr Smith elaborated that no natural populations of vertebrates on Earth dip below five to 7,000, reports space.com. ‘And when they do go below this, sometimes they survive, but many times they go into what’s called a demographic or extinction vortex,’ he explains. The best way to ensure the survival of a colony on a long-duration journey to a distant alien planet would be to have a ship large enough to house a population of a town. Another less preferred option, however, would be to send frozen sperm and eggs from Earth-bound people. Dr Smith also explains how his study would be applicable for colonisation of worlds inside out solar system such as Mars. For interstellar colonisation, however, he admits that it will require significant advances in technology before any such missions is possible. But if spacecraft speeds can be increased by 1,000, then a mission to our closest neighbouring star Proxima Centauri lasting 140 years is feasible, says Dr Smith.","Dr Smith from Portland State University says a future interstellar mission would only work if a large human colony was taken along for the trip .

"By . Emma Innes . The letter is addressed to  ‘whoever is brave enough to read me’. But the real bravery belongs to the little girl who wrote it. Nine-year-old Caitlin Robertson is trying to persuade the public to join the organ donor register following the death of her father, Gary. He died from an aneurysm on his 39th birthday last year, but saved four lives by donating his organs. Caitlin Robertson (bottom right, with brother Joe, 3, and parents Emma and Gary) has written an open letter begging people to join the organ donor register . Caitlin is so proud of her father, . whom she affectionately called her ‘Gary Baldy biscuit’, that she wants . others to follow his example. Her handwritten letter - illustrated with a pencil drawing of her dad - reads: ‘My dad Gary always helped other people. ‘My dad isn't here to watch me and my brothers grow up, but he gave all his organs to other people so now other people will get to see their children grow up. ‘I miss my dad every day but I'm so proud I was his daughter. ‘Please put your name on the organ donor list so you can save lives just like my dad.’ Mr Robertson (pictured with Caitlin and Joe) died from a ruptured brain aneurysm on his 39th birthday in March 2012. He had previously decided that he would be happy to donate his organs . Mr Robertson's death inspired Caitlin to write the letter which is decorated with a drawing of her father. She wrote: 'Please put your name on the organ donor list so you can save lives just like my dad' Caitlin’s mother Emma, 34, from, . Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, said: ‘I am immensely proud of Caitlin's efforts . to raise the profile of organ donation. ‘Gary saved four lives within hours but the total number of lives he saved will never be known. ‘My children have gone through something horrendous, but they are still always thinking of other people - just like their dad. ‘Everything that can be used for organ donation was used. Skin from back of his leg was taken for skin grafts. ‘Bones . were taken to grind down and help with knee and hip replacements. The . corneas of eyes were taken so someone has a new set of eyes. ‘Tubes . from his neck were taken to help with heart operations. People don’t . realise what can be recycled and give people a much better life, or even . save a life. ‘Gary was a care assistant, and we'd spoken about him being on the organ donor list. ‘His . attitude was “when you're gone, you're gone” - and I didn't think twice . about giving the hospital permission to use his organs to help other . people. ‘We have been told that a 29-year-old man has been given Gary's heart. ‘If . it contains just even a little bit of the love Gary had for his family, . then the person receiving it is very lucky - as he's got a heart from a . very good man. ‘He . managed to help people even after his death, and although we all miss . Gary more than I could possibly put into words, it is comforting to know . that he stopped four other families going through the same pain that we . have.’ Through his death, Mr Robertson saved at least four lives. His family has been told that his heart was given to a 29-year-old man . Mr Robertson died on his 39th birthday - just hours after complaining of a severe headache. He had been suffering from headaches for two weeks before the aneurysm, but had put the symptoms down to stress. But on his birthday, he was unable to get out of bed to look after his children - Caitlin, Ben, nine, and Joe, three. Emma rushed him to hospital, after he started vomiting and collapsed. Medics . at South Tyneside District Hospital rushed him to Newcastle's Royal . Victoria Infirmary, but after taking him in for surgery, doctors . revealed he was brain dead. He had suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm. Mr Robertson even donated skin to be used for grafts, his corneas, and blood vessels to be used in heart surgery. He was found to have a ruptured aneurysm after suffering severe headaches, vomiting and weakness . A brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel in the brain that is caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall. As the blood passes through the weakened blood vessel, the blood pressure causes it to bulge outwards like a balloon. Most brain aneurysms only cause noticeable symptoms if they rupture - this can cause extensive brain damage. Only about one in 12,500 people in the UK suffer a ruptured brain aneurysm every year. Mr Robertson (pictured with sons Ben and Joe) has inspired his family to campaign for more people to join the organ donor register . Mrs Robertson said: ‘He couldn't speak or stand. ‘When . they took him into surgery there had been so much tension and build-up . from the fluid on his brain and he'd been starved of oxygen, there was . just nothing they could do. ‘They said they also found a pea-sized malignant tumour, but that hadn't caused this, it's just been one of those things, nothing anyone could have predicted. ‘The children were devastated. They couldn't understand why their dad hadn't come home for the birthday tea they had planned for him. ‘I became involved with organ donation, and when I went to a meeting earlier this year, Caitlin wanted to come with me - but I wouldn't allow her to have any more time off school. ‘So she decided to write a letter from her for me to read out instead- and everyone was so touched.’ She added: ‘It's been incredibly tough. Gary and I were married for almost 10 years, and he was my best friend. ‘I used to call him Mr Perfect, and all my friends used to joke they wished their husbands were as perfect as Gary. ‘He's left a huge hole in our lives, but I'm glad that we have been able to use something awful to campaign for something positive to happen. ‘We will keep campaigning in Gary's name.’ To join the organ donor register click here.","Caitlin Robertson wrote an open letter begging people to join the register .

"By . Sophie Borland . Health bosses have seen their pay soar by 13 per cent in just four years - even though patients are being denied treatment because there is not enough cash. NHS figures published today that senior managers now earn an average of £76,000 a year, up from £66,000 in 2009/10. The pay-rises have been handed out despite a supposed pay-freeze across the public sector - and at a time when the NHS is meant to be saving billions of pounds to become more efficient. New figures have revealed doctors are enjoying pay rises while nurses and midwives salaries fall behind inflation . Experts say they have come about thanks to a lucrative scheme within the NHS whereby the majority of staff are automatically given a rise every year just for showing up for work. Critics are calling for the system to be abolished and say crucial health service cash is being diverted away from treatment into the already ‘bloated’ salaries of bureaucrats. Although the NHS budget has been ring-fenced from public sector cuts, hospitals and other organisations have been collectively ordered to make £20 billion of savings by next year. Officials want the money to be ploughed into improved care for the aging population and more advanced, but expensive, treatments for cancer and other life-threatening illnesses. But faced with such strict targets, many NHS trusts have been rationing certain non-emergency treatments including hip and knee replacements, cataract surgery and hernia operations. Bosses have also been slashing front-line staff and separate figures show that almost 5,000 nursing posts have been lost across the health service over the past three years. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The health budget should be spent on patient care, not pay hikes for the already bloated NHS bureaucracy. ‘The public sector is meant to have faced a pay freeze but clearly this hasn’t been the case for NHS senior managers. ‘Huge sums of taxpayers’ money have been pumped into the NHS, but far too much of this has been wasted on pay increases rather than on treatment and facilities.’ The figures reveal  the average salaries for all NHS staff have risen by 8.6 per cent since 2009/10. But doctors’ pay only went up by 2.2 per cent over this period compared to the 7.5 per cent rise seen in that of nurses and midwives. Dr Peter Carter, General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing said the figures send 'the wrong message' about the contribution of front line NHS staff . Over the last 12 months the pay for senior managers - who include chief executives and heads of department - increased by three times the rate of nurses. While nurses’ average salaries only increased by 0.6 per cent since 2011/12, senior managers’ went up by 2.2 per cent. Dr Peter Carter, General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing said: ‘Frontline health care staff work exceptionally hard in difficult circumstances to care for patients with limited resources, and these figures will send completely the wrong message about how much their contribution is valued. ‘It is not too much to ask that nurses and other front-line staff who do so much to keep the NHS afloat in increasingly difficult circumstances are treated the same as their management colleagues.” ‘We are hearing time and again from nurses who are struggling to keep their heads above water financially as their pay falls far behind inflation, and finding out that already well paid senior staff are enjoying these pay rises will be extremely demoralising. Experts say that about 55 per cent of all NHS staff enjoy an automatic or ‘incremental’ pay-rise every year just for turning up. NHS Employers - the body in charge of negotiating salaries - has repeatedly called for contracts to be changed warning they are costing the health service an extra £500 million a year. A spokesman for NHS Employers said: ‘The NHS employs over a million people with a range of different skills. The vast majority, including managers, are on incremental scales that rise each year. ‘The figures reflect that while there was a pay freeze in the NHS in 2012/13 so that headline pay did not increase, almost two thirds of all NHS staff on national pay scales would have received incremental pay progression within their salary band.’ Labour seized on the figures as proof that the Tories could not be trusted with the NHS. Jamie Reed MP, the party’s shadow health minister, said: ‘David Cameron is giving NHS managers cushy pay rises and pay-offs, whilst nurses get pay freezes or P45s. ‘He stands up for the wrong people and proves you can’t trust the Tories with the NHS.’ Earlier this week MPs from the health select committee called for hospitals to publish figures on the numbers of nurses working each night amid concerns of staffing shortages. And research by Kings College London published this week found that 43 per cent of NHS wards have too few nurses.","Senior managers now earn an average of £76,000 a year .

"By . Nick Lester . Armed Russian officials have boarded a Greenpeace ship and arrested activists, including six Britons, protesting against oil drilling in the Arctic, according to the environmental group. The Arctic Sunrise is in the remote Pechora Sea in the Russian Arctic, near to Russian oil company Gazprom's Prirazlomnaya oil platform to try and prevent attempts to drill for oil in the region. Greenpeace said the Russian coastguard abseiled onto the Arctic Sunrise from helicopters and arrested 25 protesters on-board, including six UK nationals. The armed assault by the Russian coastguard on the Greenpeace vessel Arctic Sunrise came after activists attempted to board an oil platform to prevent it drilling in the Arctic . In a tweet from the icebreaker, activists said armed guards were attempting to kick down the door of the communications room. They also tweeted: 'Latest from the deck: Crew are sitting on their knees on the helipad with guns pointed at them.' A short time later, contact with the ship was lost, Greenpeace said. It claims the Arctic Sunrise was boarded illegally, as the ship was inside Russia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in which foreign vessels should be free to navigate. These dramatic tweets from the Arctic Sunrise describe the moment armed Russian coastguard officials boarded the vessel . Two activists had already been arrested by the coastguard for a protest in which they scaled the Gazprom oil rig. Pictures of the incident released by the group showed water cannon being used, and also Russian security officials with weapons drawn. In the latest Twitter updates for the Arctic Sunrise, everyone aboard was being held under armed guard in the mess. It was reported that no one had been hurt and 'spirits are high', but that the crew were not in control of the ship. Greenpeace has condemned the boarding of Arctic Sunrise as a 'an outrageous reaction to peaceful protest'. An armed coastguard points a gun at an activist aboard a Greenpeace boat as they attempted to disrupt the Russian oil drilling operation . The environmental group is campaigning against attempts by oil companies to extract oil from the waters of the Arctic, warning a spill would be highly environmentally damaging and that extraction of more fossil fuels will add to climate change. The environmental group said Gazprom's plans to start drilling from the Prirazlomnaya platform in the first quarter of 2014 raised the risk of an oil spill in an area that contains three nature reserves protected by Russian law. Activists including the organisation's executive director, Kumi Naidoo, occupied the same platform in August 2012. Water cannon was used to try and stop Greenpeace activists climbing onto the oil platform . Mr Naidoo said: 'This illegal boarding of a peaceful protest ship highlights the extreme lengths that the Russian government will go to to keep Gazprom's dangerous Arctic drilling away from public scrutiny. 'We ask President (Vladimir) Putin to restrain the coast guard and order them to holster their guns and withdraw. We are a peaceful organisation and our protest has done nothing to warrant this level of aggression.' Ben Ayliffe, head of Greenpeace International's Arctic oil campaign, added: 'Drilling for oil here in the Arctic is a grave environmental risk that must be stopped and this is why Greenpeace International came here, taking peaceful action to defend the environment on behalf of the millions of people around the world who are opposed to drilling operations.'","The Russian coastguard abseiled onto the Arctic Sunrise from helicopterS .

"By . Simon Walters . and Glen Owen . Gordon Brown’s controversial former spin doctor Damian McBride had a drunken one-night stand with a Labour Minister, it was claimed. Friends of Mr McBride, whose blockbuster memoirs have revealed the political back-stabbings and chaos in Mr Brown’s Downing Street regime, say he had sex with the woman after a booze-fuelled party. The raucous event was attended by Whitehall mandarins and Labour aides close to Mr Brown, including figures with close links to Ed Miliband. After it ended, Mr McBride spent the night at the woman’s home. Critics will claim that this latest . allegation underlines the public interest in the amoral political world . in which Mr Brown’s spin doctor operated . The party took place at the peak of Mr Brown’s power when the woman involved was an influential Labour figure. She also served as a Labour Minister. Mr McBride has declined to comment on the claim. A source close to the woman – whom The Mail on Sunday has decided not to name – confirmed Mr McBride spent the night at her house, but said he did so only because he was ‘too drunk to go home’. The source vehemently denied the couple had sex. A friend of Mr McBride said the spin doctor had told those close to him that he had sex with a well-known Labour figure, whom he named. ‘He said he had been to a party, there was a lot of drinking and they ended up in bed together having sex,’ said the friend. The claim adds a shocking new dimension to the McBride scandal  with more explosive revelations expected when the book is published this week. Critics will claim that this latest allegation underlines the public interest in the amoral political world in which Mr Brown’s spin doctor operated. Mr Miliband’s aides further fear the book could wreck the Labour conference, which opens in Brighton tomorrow. In a separate development, ‘bullying’ Mr Brown is today attacked by former Labour Cabinet Minister Tessa Jowell, who is not the woman in the alleged McBride sex romp. She called on Mr Brown to disown Mr McBride – dubbed McPoison for his damaging briefings – and said she did not believe claims that the former Prime Minister had nothing to do with his actions. Ms Jowell, who confronted Mr Brown after a member of his team smeared her, said he must shoulder the blame for Mr McBride’s ‘disgusting and corrupt’ conduct. ‘There was a corrupt culture which had nothing to do with serving the British people but was about personal ambition,’ she said in an interview with The Mail on Sunday. ‘I feel sickened it was not just tolerated but encouraged at the heart of government. Gordon is not an innocent, it is inconceivable he did not know what Damian was doing. 'In the absence of a very clear statement by Gordon that he didn’t know about it, it damages his reputation.’ Mr Miliband's aides further fear the book could wreck the Labour conference, which opens in Brighton tomorrow . The latest extracts from Mr McBride’s book also claim that Mr Miliband sent potentially damaging emails to a party official plotting to discredit opponents. The second instalment of the memoir, published in the Daily Mail yesterday, suggested that the Labour leader might ‘have problems’ if his exchanges with party insider Derek Draper – who conspired  with Mr McBride to smear political rivals – ever emerged. Labour yesterday flatly denied the claim, saying Mr Miliband was not involved in any plan to smear or spread lies about opponents and had no recollection about any emails. A spokesman added that Mr Miliband had told Gordon Brown in September 2008 he was concerned about Mr McBride’s activities and disapproved of them. Mr McBride’s book also alleges  that Mr Miliband’s inner circle was behind anonymous attacks on Ed Balls, and concludes that Mr Miliband ‘clearly inherited all the ruthless genes in that family’. Other extracts include the revelation that Mr Brown discussed the possibility of putting troops on to the streets as the 2008 banking crisis grew. They also detailed how David Cameron had sent Mr Brown a furious Christmas card after Mr Brown accused Mr Cameron of using his children as ‘props’, and how a senior official broke down in tears as Mr Brown told Mr McBride to leak secret details of the EU budget. Meanwhile shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander denied claims by Mr McBride that he knifed his politician sister, Wendy, by telling Mr Brown ‘that she had to quit’ following a row about donations to her Scottish Labour leadership campaign. Mr Alexander said: ‘I always supported my sister and I never supported Damian McBride. That might explain why he writes about me in those terms. He was discredited when he left Downing Street. The politics he embodied has been completely discredited and thankfully the Labour Party has moved on.’ He added that ‘lying’ was ‘what Damian McBride does’. Yesterday’s extracts revealed for the first time the extent of Mr McBride’s drinking. He told how he had enjoyed a ‘cracker’ of a 35th birthday in 2005, when he combined afternoon drinking with briefings to journalists in which he claimed that Mr Brown had put ‘lead in Tony Blair’s pencil’ over EU negotiations. He fell asleep on the sofa and woke up at midday the next day to find he had 26 missed calls, including several from a furious Mr Brown – who had been bawled by Mr Blair over the newspaper stories. It came as Ed Balls admitted for the first time that he had been part of a ‘macho’ gang around Mr Brown. He said: ‘We were young and inexperienced . . . it was a mistake and it was damaging to the Government.’ Damian had two nicknames, 'Mad Dog' and 'McPoison'. Only the latter was accurate.  He was, and still is, a very sophisticated political operator. By DAN HODGES Labour Adviser . I could have been Damian McBride.When Gordon Brown was looking for a new communications adviser, I was asked by two Brown allies if I wanted the job. I did. But as is the way of Westminster, I never heard anything again and Damian moved into position. Gordon made the right call. I was a spin-chorister compared to Damian. As the storm over his new book has revealed, few political advisors have inspired such fear and loathing. By Damian’s own admission, anything and anyone was fair game. His only rule? There were no rules. Damian McBride is Labour’s Keyser Soze, the almost supernaturally evil villain from the film The Usual Suspects. Six years after he vanished from frontline politics, many still fear the hand of McBride reaching out in the night and inflicting some terrible vengeance. Although a neat analogy, Damian McBride is not one of the usual suspects. Contrary to the popular impression of him as a Neanderthal hatchet-man, he has a fearsome intellect. An alumnus of Peterhouse, Cambridge, he is a much-prized member of the teams at the pub quizzes he loves to frequent. Damian had two nicknames, ‘Mad Dog’ and ‘McPoison’. Only the latter was accurate.  He was, and still is, a very sophisticated political operator. And as one of his Blairite foes has grudgingly conceded, Damian was persistent, and ruthless, in pursuit of his prey. ‘He practised methodical destruction,’ he said. One of the reasons for this is that Damian was not a political activist, but a career civil servant. He worked in the Treasury, where he was spotted by Brown, who made him his personal press aide. Over the past few days a number of people have condemned his ‘disloyalty’ to Labour. But he was a Brown man, not a Labour man. Those saying Damian would have nothing if it wasn’t for the party miss the point. He believes he’d have nothing if it wasn’t for Gordon Brown. He also enjoys a drink, and a karaoke mike. After a hard day in the Treasury he could often be spotted holding court in a Soho drinking den. Although not a founder member, Damian’s hard-carousing ways quickly earned him acceptance into the notoriously tightly-knit Brown inner circle. ‘It’s just what we Brownites are like,’ one of Damian’s friends told me. ‘We’re not Blairites, with their fine wines and dinner parties. We like a curry and a sing-song.’ Fatefully, so did Damian. He was also able to expand Brown’s circle of press contacts. ‘Damian loved political gossip and process,’ said another friend. ‘He’d sit there and tell you the most outrageous things, then say, ‘‘of course, that’s all off the record’’.’ He found the rigid strictures of the civil service machine frustrating, and revelled in the freedom to brief openly. ‘I think that was part of the problem,’ said one Labour insider. ‘He’d been sitting there kicking his heels at the Treasury, then along came Brown and suddenly he was part of this Alpha-male, all-lads-together culture. It was like the leash had been taken off.’ Damian’s critics view the publication of his diaries as an act of supreme selfishness. But he has been told via intermediaries there’s no prospect of a return to Labour’s inner circle while Ed Miliband is leader. The book has also created further tensions in his now-strained relationship with Brown himself. I could never really have been Damian McBride. I’m not tough enough, ruthless enough, or sophisticated enough. Plus, I’m rubbish at karaoke.

"By . Andrew Levy . Hundreds of teachers are spending all or part of their time on union work, costing taxpayers £15million a year. Some union representatives are paid teaching salaries of up to £70,000 yet many have not taken a class for years, a survey has shown. Their salaries are paid by local authorities and schools receive no extra money to cover for the union reps – meaning  they have less to spend on educating pupils. Conflict: Michael Gove has been at war with teaching unions over pay and pensions . Under the system, trade union . officials can take ‘reasonable’ paid time off for union work, known as . facilities time, such as  representing members in employment disputes. But the definition of what is reasonable is wide open to interpretation. Now the Department for Education is to investigate the issue at a time when Education Secretary Michael Gove is effectively at war with the two biggest teachers’ unions over pay and conditions. The DfE said it was taking action due to demands by local authorities and headteachers and insisted the timing was coincidental. A source said: ‘The view is by the end of the year we will be issuing robust advice.’ The situation has also created vast differences in the amount of money being diverted to union causes. The Department for Education, headed by Michael Gove, has said it will issue robust guidance on the issue . A TaxPayers’ Alliance survey of public . funding for all unions last year found Birmingham, which has 1.1million . residents, spends £458,000 for ten full-time equivalent education reps. Yet Kent, with a population of 1.5million, diverts around £144,000. The . study suggested that, overall, at least £14.5million is spent on more . than 427 full-time equivalent posts each year. Official figures have . never been compiled. NUT General Secretary Christine Blower has said that the representative are essential . Schools minister David Laws yesterday signalled at least half of union reps’ time should be spent teaching. ‘It is reasonable to expect all trade union representatives in schools to spend the majority of their working hours carrying out school-based jobs. ‘They should not be spending all their taxpayer-funded time out of the classroom.’ The DfE said there were no plans to change the rules but said it was necessary to clarify how they are implemented. It added: ‘A large number of union representatives are paid as teachers but do not spend any of their contracted time teaching. ‘This creates additional work for the very many hardworking teachers across the country. 'Some of these local, regional and national union representatives have not taught in a school for many years. 'This represents a significant cost to the taxpayer of many millions of pounds.’ The National Union of Teachers and NASUWT, which represent 90 per cent of teachers between them, have been holding regional strikes over issues including payrise caps, the introduction of performance-related pay and changes to pensions. Two more are planned next month before a national walk-out nearer the end of this term. NUT general secretary Christine Blower said union reps were essential for maintaining good relationships between employers and employees. She added: ‘We will of course take part in the review to present the excellent case for maintaining facilities time.’ Russell Hobby, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘It is not for the government to specify how unions should organise themselves.’ Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The schools budget should be spent on educating our children, not subsidising unions.’","Survey shows hundreds of teachers spending time on union work .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The Conservatives have extended their lead over Labour as the party most trusted on the economy to 18 points, a new poll revealed tonight. In a major blow for Labour leader Ed Miliband on the eve of his party conference, the survey found just one in five voters think he has the best policies to manage the recovery. By contrast David Cameron and George Osborne are backed by almost twice as many voters, amid increasing signs that growth is gaining momentum. Issues: When asked which party has the best policies on the economy, 38 per cent said the Conservatives compared to just 20 per cent who said Labour . The surprise surge in support for the Tories comes after two successive quarters of growth, leading Mr Osborne to boast that the economy has ‘turned a corner’. According to the Ipsos Mori poll, 38 per cent of people now say the Conservatives have the best policies on the economy, with Labour trailing on just 20 per cent. It marks a dramatic shift in the last six months, when the two parties were neck and neck. In March just 27 per cent of voters backed the Tories on the economy  with 26 per cent preferring Labour. Coalition hopes of slashing government borrowing before the next election  have also been boosted. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows the deficit stood at £13.3billion in August, compared to £14.2billion in the same month last year. And borrowing in 2012-13 was far lower than previously thought – down from £50.4billion to £46.8billion between April and August. Living costs: Labour leader Ed Miliband used a Q&A session in Brighton to claim he was on the side of ordinary people, but only 23 per cent of people think they would be better off if he became Prime Minister . The figures show the Exchequer is starting to benefit from an improved economy with Whitehall spending on items such as unemployment benefit falling and tax receipts starting to perk up. Mr Osborne has been under constant fire from the Labour Party for pursuing an austerity plan it claimed was failing to cut the deficit and deliver growth. Speaking at an open-air Q&A session in Brighton on the eve of his party conference today, Mr Miliband again tried to accuse the Tories of only acting in the interests of the wealthy. The Labour leader said: ‘The way a country succeeds is not just with a few at the top it's with what I call the forgotten wealth creators. ‘The people who put in the hours, who do the work, who do two jobs, who do the shifts. ‘They are the people we should be supporting in this country. That's how we tackle the cost of living crisis, that's how we have an economy that works for working people again in our country.’ But according to the Ipsos Mori poll just 23 per cent of people think they would be better off under a Labour government, with 22 per cent saying a Tory government. Just over half (52 per cent) said it would make no difference either way. News that the Tories are now backed on the economy by almost two to one will worry Labour MPs and activists as they gather in Brighton this weekend. Gideon Skinner, head of Political Research at Ipsos MORI said: ‘The economy has been the number one issue facing the country for five straight years now, and after six consecutive months of rising economic optimism perhaps it is no surprise to see the Conservatives take a clear lead here. ‘Meanwhile, the image of the parties going into conference season shows the challenges they face: the Conservatives are seen as the most fit to govern and with the best team of leaders, while Labour has the lead on understanding Britain’s problems and looking after the interests of the man and woman on the street. ‘The Liberal Democrats have lost the mantle of the outsider party to UKIP.’ Clash: Chancellor George Osborne is growing increasingly optimistic about the pace of the recovery but shadow chancellor Ed Balls has accused the government of being complacent . With just 18 months until the 2015 general election campaign gets underway, Labour is under prerssure to set out policies which will persuade doubtful voters they are fit to govern. Today Mr Miliband promised to increase the minimum wage, offer more childcare support for parents and reverse £470million worth of housing benefit changes he described as the ‘bedroom tax’. While Labour still has a lead over the Tories on the NHS, only a third (36 per cent) now say Mr Miliband’s party has the best policies on health care, down from 46 per cent. The proportion backing the Conservatives has grown from 16 per cent to 21 per cent. Labour also leads on education, housing and unemployment policy, while the Conservatives are seen to have the best policies on asylum and immigration and crime and anti-social behaviour. Just under half (47 per cent) of people see the Tories as fit to govern – compared with 38 per cent for Labour, 17 per cent for the Liberal Democrats and 14 per cent for UKIP.","38% say Conservatives have best economic policies, just 20% said Labour .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . If you've been know to let fly with the odd expletive in the presence of your newborn, it might be time to stop. Scientists have discovered that not only do babies pick up language from their parents, they can understand three times as many words as they can say. What's more, infants have incredible mnemonic powers which means they can parrot a stray swear word back to you weeks after you let it slip. Clever: Ella and Finn Burton (pictured with their mother) had learned sign language by the age of six months . The incredible findings will be unveiled on ITV documentary, Secret Life of Babies, which also features twins Ella and Finn Burton, two, from New Maulden in London, who learned to communicate far earlier than their peers. Because both of their parents are profoundly deaf, the pair were exposed to sign language from birth - and began signing their desires to their parents from the age of six months. 'It's interesting because at the . beginning when we were at home, it would be just the four of us and we . would be signing all the time,' reveals their proud father, Toby Burton. 'When they were very young, it felt at . times as if you were speaking to a brick wall - you didn't get any . response -  and then a few months later, they would tap me and start recalling what I had told them a few weeks or months before.' While Ella and Finn were able to build upon their parents use of sign language, babies born to average parents are equally good at remembering words - even if it does take them longer to vocalise it. Proof: The pair appear to bear out scientists' findings by learning to communicate before they could talk . Evolved: Babies are naturally afraid of plants but learn the correct response to animals from their parents . Clever: Most babies learn to talk by watching their parents' mouths and copying the motion . 'I . found it amazing how they were able to recall that information,' adds Mr Burton. 'Once . they had mastered sign language, they could re-tell that story to me . very clearly.' Interestingly, the twins' ability to communicate in sign language has had no impact on their ability to pick up spoken words. 'They . have started going to nursery and are hearing sound and spoken language . a lot more so now they use spoken and sign language at the . same time,' says their mother, Emma. 'If they hear . someone speaking, they respond using their spoken language,' adds Mr Burton. 'If they see . someone signing, they will respond in sign so they're using a mixture of . both.' As the documentary reveals, Ella and Finn's incredible communication skills aren't unique, with all babies born with the ability to recognise the 150 different sounds that make up every language in the world. But speaking isn't the only surprising skill common to the majority of babies. Most babies loathe plants, a quirk that scientists say evolved to protect them from poisonous and thorny fauna. Equally interesting is the reason for babies' seemingly magical ability to drop off to sleep during car journeys. According to scientists, this goes back to hearing their mother's heart beat while in the womb which they can hear so loudly, its decibel equivalent is the sound of a car engine. The muffled sounds . of the engine and the gentle rocking motion of driving mimics life inside the womb, helping them to drift off to sleep - one tip that exhausted new mothers might want to remember.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Struck off: Trainee surgeon Suhail Ahmed has been struck off the medical register after he was found to have taken more than 100 intimate photos of women during examinations . A trainee surgeon has been struck off the medical register after he was found to have transformed a hospital ward into his own secret porn studio, a hearing has heard. Suheil Ahmed, 28, took more than 100 photographs of women while carrying out intimate examinations of women at Torbay Hospital in Devon. He sectioned off their beds from the rest of the ward, before touching his victims as he removed their clothing to allow himself a better view. During the intimate examinations Ahmed told his victims, who were all in their 20s, that he was using a mobile phone to time their breathing or heart rate. He also installed a secret camera in a house owned by his family to film students using the toilet. Ahmed was suspended by Torbay Hospital after two women complained about their examinations, sparking a probe into his conduct. A police investigation found 110 images of patients uploaded to his home personal computer along with footage from a secret camera installed in a property belonging to his family. He initially denied any wrongdoing, claiming he had taken the pictures for his medical portfolio. But Ahmed, who lived in Cardiff, admitted 11 counts of voyeurism and two counts of sexual assault by touching when he appeared at Exeter Crown Court. He was jailed for 18 months last October later increased to 30 months after the Court of Appeal found the sentence was ‘unduly lenient’. The doctor was facing fitness to practise proceedings at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester last Wednesday to Friday where he was branded an ‘on-going risk to patients'. Neil Usher, for the General Medical Council, told the panel that Dr Ahmed’s crimes constituted a ‘gross breach of trust’ and said the medic remained a ‘danger to the public’. Ahmed was jailed to 18 months in prison at Exeter Crown Court in October, but his sentenced was lengthened at the Court of Appeal to 30 months after the original sentence was found to be too lenient . The MPTS panel, chaired by Mr Jetinder Shergill, found his actions were so serious that the only appropriate sanction was to impose a lifetime ban from the profession. ‘The panel has concluded that Dr Ahmed’s actions are fundamentally incompatible with him continuing to be a registered medical practitioner,’ Mr Shergill said. ‘The panel was satisfied Dr Ahmed’s actions caused deliberate harm to patients including serious harm to the emotional health of the victims. ‘He abused his position of trust from early on in his career. This abuse occurred when patients were particularly vulnerable due to being in acute pain or in a post-operative recovery state. ‘The sexual nature of the offending in a hospital setting was very serious. ‘The panel has therefore determined that erasure is the most appropriate sanction.’ Dr Ahmed, who is still serving his prison sentence, will be struck off in 28 days, subject to appeal, although the panel imposed an immediate order of suspension.","Dr Suheil Ahmed, 28, will be struck off in 28 days medical tribunal rules .

Infrared video from the deck of the boat shows her terrible tumble from her balcony on the Carnival Destiny ship after a few drinks on a five-night Caribbean cruise with her fiance and a friend. In the legal complaint she filed last year, Kirby claims that she became 'extremely intoxicated' after drinking Long Island Teas that a barman 'kept pushing onto the plaintiff.' Courthouse News Service reported that the complaint stated that the bartender encouraged the group to get drunk by giving them free $5 tokens for the ship's casino the more they drank. Kirby claims that she then returned to her cabin. The filing goes on: 'At approximately 12:10 am, the . plaintiff stepped out to the cabin balcony to get some air. 'As she was . holding on to the balcony's wooden banister, the plaintiff lost her grip . and balance, slipped off the ground and fell overboard into the ocean.' Kirby struck a life raft on they way down. Painful: Infrared video from the deck of the boat shows her terrible tumble from her balcony on the Carnival Destiny ship after a few drinks on a five-night Caribbean cruise with her fiance and a friend . Once in the water Kirby told ABC: 'I just prayed to God over and over please don't let me die out here.' But she alleges that staff on the boat they refused to turn the vessel round to rescue her until they had conducted a 90-minute search of the ship, despite her party and other passengers reporting seeing her go overboard. When they eventually turned round to pick her up, Kirby had been in the water for nearly two hours without a life jacket and had believed that 'death was imminent' from drowning or shark attack. According to Courthouse News Service the complaint states that 'rather than treating her severe . injuries, the Carnival doctors' treatment of the plaintiff was primarily . limited to giving her pain medication.' Kirby reportedly had: 'fractured orbital bones, lung contusions, . hypothermia, fractured ribs, dissection of the carotid artery, heart . arrhythmia, broken optical shelves, blood clots in her eyes, arms, and . legs, as well as extreme hematomas all over her body.' Legal challenge: Kirby was rescued after nearly two hours floating in the sea but received serious injuries. She is suing Carnival Cruises for negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress . The woman states that the cruise was diverted to Key West, instead of her being airlifted to Miami. Kirby is suing for damages for negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In a statement to ABC, Carnival Cruises said that these claims are 'are completely unsupported and contradicted by the evidence in the case.'","Sarah Kirby, 31, fell off her balcony seven stories into the sea during a Caribbean cruise in October 2012 .

"By . Sam Webb . Fierce winds, huge waves and torrential rain could sweep Britain as the remnants of Hurricane Bertha strike the country. There is a 60 per chance that the tail-end of the storm, currently heading across the Atlantic towards Europe, will hit the UK on Sunday morning. If it does come our way it could result in flash flooding as three weeks’ worth of rain falls in just a few hours. Winds of up to 60mph are also expected, with huge waves battering the coast. However forecasters are still hoping the the storm veers off course and misses Britain altogether. Enjoy it while it lasts: People relaxing during lunch on Brighton beach today. Temperatures reached around the 20C in Brighton and the South Coast. However, the situation looks very different on Sunday because the remnants of Hurricane Bertha could make landfall . Today has stayed dry for most of the UK, with isolated showers continuing in the northwest. Pictured, sunbathers on Brighton beach . Catching some rays: A group of friends enjoy the Beach at Brighton. They may want to stay way Sunday, ast there's a good chance of heavy rain and bruising winds . Last night the Met Office was taking no chances and issued a severe weather warning for most of England and Wales, urging people to keep an eye on ‘volatile’ conditions. A separate weather system will also cause heavy rain across the country today – before Bertha even arrives. The hurricane formed in the warm waters of the Caribbean last weekend, lashing the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands with winds of up to 90mph. Bertha then travelled north, veering safely away from the US and Canadian coast before heading across the Atlantic. It has now been downgraded to an ‘Atlantic storm’, losing power as it travels. Forecasters say there is a 60 per cent chance it will hit the southern coast of England on Sunday morning, before it sweeps up towards the North-East. There is a smaller chance – around 10 per cent – that it could track further north, striking Wales, then Manchester and Cumbria. There is a 30 per cent chance it will go further south, missing England and blowing over France instead. Looming menace: Hurricane Bertha is losing power but could still bring heavy rain and strong winds to the UK . There are weather warnings across the south and large swathes of the Midlands, warning of flooding and standing water on the roads. Right, a satellite image of Hurricane Bertha close to the east Coast of America taken yesterday . Eddy Carroll, chief forecaster at the Met Office, said: ‘The remains of Hurricane Bertha, over the western side of the Atlantic on Thursday morning, will come steadily towards the UK. ‘There is the potential for widespread rainfall totals of more than 50mm [almost two inches] and coastal gusts of over 60mph, along with large waves. [But] there is still considerable uncertainty and a chance the system may pass to the south of the country, or spread heavy rain even further north. ‘The transition from a tropical to an extra-tropical feature is a particularly hard one to forecast... Computer models continue to differ in the location and intensity of the resulting depression, which is expected to pass over, or close to, the UK from early on Sunday.’ Idyll: Crowds gather on Fistral Beach on the second day of the Boardmasters surf and music festival in Newquay in Cornwall, today .

Laura Young, Met Office spokesman, added: ‘Given that it is the summer and people are not prepared for weather like this, it could have a real impact. ‘People who went away for the first fortnight of the school holidays will be returning this weekend, so there may be travel disruptions.’ The Environment Agency also warned of flash flooding throughout England today as a depression comes in from the Channel. Craig Woolhouse, the agency’s flood incident manager, said: ‘Heavy downpours, some slow-moving, bring a risk of localised surface water flooding to parts of the Midlands, the North-West and eastern areas of England on Friday. ‘On Sunday and Monday high spring tides and strong westerly winds bring a possible risk of flooding to the South-West coast of England and along the Severn Estuary. ‘Heavy rain may also lead to localised surface water flooding in parts of southern and central England.’ Fun in the sun: The main shopping street in Newcastle was transformed into a kid's paradise this morning when campaigners for Sure Start installed paddling pools in the road .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . England all-rounder Moeen Ali stirred up an extraordinary altercation between cricket and religious chiefs by wearing his ‘Free Palestine’ and ‘Save Gaza’ wristbands during the third Test against India. Ali, a committed Muslim, was warned by the match referee not to wear them again as this would be seen as making political, religious or racial statements during matches. But senior Rabbi Yisroel Fine of Cockfosters was so enraged by Ali’s political stance in support of Gaza that he phoned England Cricket Board chairman Giles Clarke to complain. Controversy: Moeen Ali's wristbands got him in trouble with the Match Referee but not the ECB . Backing his man: ECB chairman Giles Clarke clashed with a London Rabbi over the incident . There then followed a very heated exchange with both parties reportedly shocked by the rudeness and aggression being used by the other. Clarke gave his full backing to Ali, saying there was no way he would interfere with a player wanting to express his opinions. As a result Rabbi Fine, a cricket-lover who has retired from his synagogue leadership, is considering quitting his membership of the MCC, although Clarke has no part in its running. Meanwhile, Ian Bell, chosen to speak to the media after Ali’s wristband protest, was briefed that he would probably be asked questions about Gaza. ‘Who’s Gaza?’ responded Bell. It is expected that a big newspaper serialisation of Kevin Pietersen’s much-awaited autobiography will begin in the same week as the October 9 date of publication of the book by Little, Brown. The England Cricket Board, who haven’t handled their KP divorce case well, are said to have a PR strategy in place ahead of KP’s launch day in order to neuter the news value of his revelations about his falling out with England captain Alastair Cook and coach Andy Flower. War of words: England are preparing themselves for KP's autobiography which will be published in October . But it’s being kept under wraps, so as not to alert the KP camp. Ronnie Irani, former Essex cricketer and talkSPORT breakfast show host, was involved in a confrontation with a drunken heckler in Manchester. Police intervened when the drunk smashed his fist on the bonnet of Irani’s car. The incident took place next to where a Maserati was parked. It was assumed by the crowd that the super sports car with the personalised IRAN number plate was indeed Ronnie’s. However, Irani, who now sells customised insoles after leaving talkSPORT, was driving an Audi. Eric Harrison, coach of Manchester United’s Class of ’92, hasn’t lost his will to win at the age of 76. Harrison made clear to former pupils Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers at half-time in their 5-1 charity match defeat by their own Salford City that they were underperforming and letting down the 12,000 crowd. Robbie Savage, another product of that United class, played so poorly up front that Gary Neville called him ‘Railings’ — because the ball kept bouncing back off him. Neville looks a stayer . Phil Neville explained during a lunchtime interview with Jonathan Agnew on Test Match Special on Friday how he quickly recovered from that nightmare first co-commentary on England v Italy in Manaus to land a full portfolio of BBC football roles, suggesting he has the mental resolve to become a successful analyst. Back for good: Phil Neville will continue to work for the BBC despite a difficult start to his broadcasting career . Meanwhile, Agnew, the BBC’s voice of cricket, is turning his talents in other directions with the Beeb making him their equestrian, dressage and showjumping expert for the Olympics in Rio and giving him time to learn about the new sports. International law firm Stephenson Harwood are now representing former Leeds CEO David Haigh, who has been held without charge in a Dubai jail since May 18 following his falling out with former Leeds owners GFH Capital. Haigh’s bank accounts have been frozen, but his new lawyers will freeze payments until Haigh can pay.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Boris Johnson today took on his critics to insist he is a 'totally different' person to the last time he was an MP and set his sights on a serious government job. He defended his decision to stand for Parliament next year while still London Mayor, amid a backlash from Tory MPs who suspect he will not be a team player. But his attempt to present himself as a man ready to take the tough decisions was overshadowed when he inexplicably appeared at a photocall wearing goggles and purple gloves to prune a tree. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson today insisted he was on top of the serious job of government, before pruning a tree during a visit to Sutton House in Hackney, north London . The photoshoot was supposed to a £2million fund to rejuvenate and transform small patches of uncultivated and overlooked land into green spaces . Without telling David Cameron in advance, Mr Johnson dramatically announced yesterday that he plans to stand for Parliament in May next year and is hunting for a seat. There is already talk that Mr Johnson has already assembled a 'kitchen cabinet' to run not just his leadership campaign but to support him in the first months of his premiership. For many voters, the reports will be at odds with his chaotic and crumpled appearance. Those in Westminster with long memories also recall that when he was last in the Commons he regularly made news for the wrong reasons, including sparking a row with Jamie Oliver, upsetting the people of Liverpool and resigning from the frontbench over allegations of having an affair. But today Mr Johnson insisted he was a change man. In an interview with the Evening Standard, he said: 'Yeah, I think I'm genuinely totally different. I mean, whether human beings ever change is a good question, isn't it. 'But if you do a job like this in London for a very long time, and you see the way people depend on you getting it right, and you have to engage with people who really feel that fares are too high, who are really being hurt by it, or people who cannot get a home for their children, I think you do. 'I think I understand the business of government pretty well now. And I hope very much at some stage to be doing it.' 24 hours after announcing his plan to stand for Parliament next year, Mr Johnson also visited the Orthodox Jewish community in Stamford Hill today, where he pointed at met Rabbi Oscher Schapiro . The comments will be seen as a claim to be more in touch with voters, and a clear indication that he hopes to secure a Cabinet job in a future Tory government. He will spend a year as London Mayor and an MP, before City Hall elections in 2016. He will then be free to join the frontbench. If the Conservatives are in government after the general election, he can expect a Cabinet job, but if David Cameron loses, he will be in prime position to launch a leadership bid. He played down such talk today: 'When Dave steps down in 2030 or so I will be too old. There’ll be a very wide field, probably including babes yet unborn.' Mr Johnson's announcement that he will stand as an MP yesterday came as he answered questions following a speech on Europe at Bloomberg's London headquarters. Bookmakers Ladbrokes responded by slashing the odds of Mr Johnson becoming the next Conservative leader from 5/1 to 9/4. Labour said it was a clear sign the Tories were turning in on themselves with Mr Cameron powerless to intervene. Amid claims Mr Johnson has his eye set on becoming Prime Minister, Nick Clegg warned the messy hair and 'bumbliness' is just a front to disguise his ruthless ambition. He appeared dishevelled and sweaty during his speech at Bloomberg yesterday, but Nick Clegg suggested it was all part of an act to disguise his ruthlessness . Mr Clegg insisted that the messy hair and creased suit was part of an image as carefully managed as his political ambitions. The Deputy Prime Minister said the London mayor liked to pretend he did not care about his appearance or career - but was actually 'fixated' with them.. Speaking on his LBC radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said: 'The thing about Boris Johnson is despite all the kind of clumsiness and bumbliness, he's actually a really, really ambitious politician... 'He treats his political ambition a bit like he treats his hair. He wants everyone to think that he doesn't really care, but he actually really, really does care.' The Lib Dem leader said Mr Johnson had until now been able to 'have his cake and eat it'. 'He will have to come clean about the fact that he is in many ways a much more conventional politician than he likes to appear,' Mr Clegg said. 'His tousled hair, his bumbliness, his humour, all of that is great... all I am saying is behind all of that is someone who is absolutely fixated with his own political ambitions. In that sense, he is actually a very conventional politician. 'In a sense, being a mayor is great, a wonderful position to have, but you can kind of have your cake and eat it. You can sort of lob grenades into the political debate without having to take responsibility for stuff. 'At some point he is actually going to have to say 'I'm going to do responsible stuff, I've got to take difficult decisions'.' The Deputy Prime Minister used his weekly radio phone-in to claim Mr Johnson's political ambitions actually made him quite 'conventional' Deciding to stand for election is just the first step for Boris Johnson - now he must find a seat. With just nine months to go until the general election, most sitting Tory MPs have either decided to stand again, or have quit and already had a successor selected. Mr Johnson will need a constituency close to London, which rules out Louth and Horncastle. And there must be a vacancy, which should exclude Bromley and Chislehurst, where Bob Neill insists he will stand again. Which makes Uxbridge most likely, just 20 miles from City Hall and Sir John Randall is standing down, leaving a health majority of more than 11,000. UXBRIDGE . Current MP: Sir John Randall, 59, is retiring . Majority: 11,216 . Distance from City Hall: 20 miles . HERTSMERE . Current MP: James Clappison, 57, not re-adopted . Majority: 17,605 . Distance from City Hall: 16 miles . HORNCHURCH & UPMINSTER . Current MP: Angela Watkinson, 72, still standing . Majority: 16,371 . Distance from City Hall: 16 miles . LOUTH AND HORNCASTLE . Current MP: Sir Peter Tapsell, retiring . Majority: 13,871 . Distance from City Hall: 150 miles . HENLEY . Current MP: John Howell, 59, standing again . Majority: 16,588 . Distance from City Hall: 40 miles . CROYDON SOUTH . Current MP: Sir Richard Ottaway, 69, standing down . Majority: 15,818 . Distance from City Hall: 12 miles . BROMLEY & CHISLEHURST . Current MP: Bob Neill, 62, standing again . Majority: 13,900 . Distance from City Hall: 10 miles . Pressure had been growing on Mr Johnson over several months to finally say whether or not he will mount a bid to return to the Commons. He quit as MP for Henley in 2008 after being elected Mayor of London. But since Mr Cameron became Prime Minister in 2010 there has been mounting speculation that Mr Johnson would seek a route back to Westminster, after vowing to only serve two terms at City Hall. Mr Cameron has suggested his old friend could remain in charge of the capital and take a seat in Cabinet if he becomes an MP at the next election. Yesterday Mr Johnson departed from tradition and gave a straight answer, confirming he would run for Parliament in the general election next year. Speaking at Bloomberg in London, he said: 'I have danced around it for an awfully long time. The Prime Minster said ages ago that he would welcome me back. 'It is also been pretty clear I cannot endlessly go on dodging these questions as I have tried to do. 'Let me put it this way. I haven't got any seat lined up yet. But I do think that in all probability, since you cannot do these things furtively, in all probability I will try to find somewhere to stand in 2015.' However, Labour accused Mr Johnson of breaking a pledge not to try to return to Parliament while he was still London Mayor. In 2012 election he told the Evening Standard he would 'serve out that term in full' and keeping his 'solemn vow' to lead the capital out of recession and deliver growth 'cannot be combined with any other political capacity'. Every time a Tory safe seat has become available when an sitting MP has announced plans to stand down, Mr Johnson has been linked with it. The most recent has been Uxbridge, where Tory MP Sir John Randall is retiring in 2015. Mr Johnson's announcement came after a stridently Eurosceptic speech, during which he listed a series of hardline reforms he wants to see before agreeing to support a vote to stay in the EU. Within hours, his return to Westminster was welcomed by a series of backbenchers who hope Mr Johnson can attract UKIP voters back to the Tories. The Mayor does not even have a seat yet – although the recently vacated West London constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, a safe Tory seat, is up for grabs after the retirement of its sitting member. Ladbrokes slashed the odds of Mr Johnson becoming the next Conservative leader from 5/1 to 9/4, while Labour said it was a clear sign the Tories were turning in on themselves with Mr Cameron powerless to intervene. There was speculation last night that should Mr Johnson be elected and the Tories win the election with a comfortable majority, he could be offered a ministerial job at Business, Transport or another wide-ranging infrastructure role after he has stepped down as mayor.","London Mayor insists he has learned how government works in 8 years .

"By . James Gordon . An enormous Star Wars X-Wing spaceship has landed in New York's Times Square. It took 32 master builders more than five million LEGO bricks and took 17,000 hours to put together the full-scale replica of the Star Wars fighter. The LEGO X-Wing is the largest Lego model in history. It's as big as the real thing and would be capable of fitting the real Luke Skywalker inside. Scroll down for video... Landed: Thousands gather in New York City's Times Square to watch the unveiling of the world's largest LEGO Model, a 1:1 replica of the LEGO Star Wars X-wing Starfighter . Extra Large: This Incredible Full Scale Lego X-Wing Is the Largest Model In History . The full scale mode imitates the official $60 Lego 9493 X-Wing Fighter - except it's just 42 times larger. However instead of just 560-pieces and a few inches in length, this model uses more than five million pieces. It's 11-feet tall, 43-feet long and has a 44-foot wingspan. The engines also glow and roar as per the films - and you can sit inside. The Star Wars-themed, 46,000-pound spacecraft arrived in 34 sections by container ship from Kladno in the Czech Republic. Star Tours: The world's largest Lego modelled after the Star Wars X-wing starfighter is seen at Times Square after being unveiled in New York . This one can't fly: The model was transported to the United States by boat from the LEGO Model Shop in Kladno, Czech Republic, where it was constructed by a team of 32 builders . Count 'em: The model contains 5,335,200 bricks and is as big as the real thing, capable of fitting the real Luke Skywalker . The model is on display in the middle of Times Square until Saturday. The X-wing comes complete with a photo booth in the cockpit, engines that light up, and a host of sound effects. LEGO state: 'The model was heavily engineered to withstand all the transportation, setup/break down and to ensure it was safe for Times Square given the subway system below and California’s seismic requirements for the LEGOLAND California Resort installation.' The model is so heavy that it requires an internal metal structure to support it. 'Just as kids love to test and hone their LEGO building skills and imaginative storytelling, our LEGO Master Builders are always testing their creative skills to top their last larger-than-life sized creations,' Michael McNally, LEGO's brand relations director explained. Side view: 43 feet long and with a 44 foot wingspan, the LEGO X-Wing Starfighter holds the record for largest ever model . Big brother: The model reproduces the official $60 Lego 9493 X-Wing Fighter. But instead of being 560-pieces and a few inches long, this model uses more than five million pieces . Long term: From conception to completion, the plane took more than one year to make . 'The size and structural complexity of a freestanding model 42 times the size of one our retail sets was a challenge they could not resist.' 'I've built pretty big things with LEGO, but this is the biggest ever,' says Lego master builder Erik Varszegi at an unveiling ceremony in Manhattan. 'It's a life-size version,' he added. 'That means the same scale it was built for the film.' It will will be in position over the weekend and then moved to the West Coast for the remainder of the year. Part the display also includes life-sized LEGO models of Darth Vader, Yoda, and R2D2. Not available in stores: LEGO sculptures of Star Wars characters are seen after the unveiling of the world's largest LEGO Model . Pilot: The model is so large that budding Luke Skywalker wannabes can sit in the cockpit . Franchise: the model was built to celebrate the forthcoming premiere of the latest Lego Star Wars series The Yoda Chronicles, a three-part animated miniseries launching on Cartoon Network . Although the model is a publicity stunt, the X-Wing unveiling also promotes a series of other projects: The Yoda Chronicles, a new animated Star Wars miniseries on the Cartoon Network, and of course the 2015 movie from J.J. Abrams. LEGO is now in its 14th year of partnership with Star Wars and has sold more than 200 million building sets, 30 million copies of four video games and 450 different Lego Star Wars mini-figures. LEGO Star Wars has also played a huge part in boosting the Danish company's profits which have grown by 40 per cent in the past five years. Just ten years ago the toy company was on the verge on bankruptcy. Perspective: The model is enormous and the largest ever constructed. The X-Wing will move to California next for the rest of the year .","Model took four months to complete .

Never again can Moeen Ali be considered a part-time spinner, not now that ‘the beard’ will be well and truly feared after the perfect end to the complete Test for England and captain Alastair Cook. What a turnaround from the embarrassing last day at Lord’s. What a  performance from a man who found himself in the eye of a storm over his views on Gaza before creating a storm that engulfed India’s batsmen. Moeen may be different to the stereotypical English sportsman but what is absolutely clear, after he took the last four of the six wickets to fall at The Ageas Bowl on Thursday in 22 balls, is that he is the rightful successor to Graeme Swann. VIDEO Scroll down for Moeen Ali: This was my best moment in an England shirt . Man of the moment: Moeen Ali celebrates taking the wicket of Bhuvneshwar Kumar . Time for cheer: England celebrate beating India and leveling the series at 1-1 . Joy of six: Ali celebrates taking the wicket of Mohammed Shami . Long walk: MS Dhoni returns to the pavilion after being dismissed . VIDEO My best day - Moeen . It says everything about the scale of . Moeen’s achievement in taking six for 67 as India plummeted to a . 266-run defeat that he has now claimed more wickets in three Tests than . Swann managed in four against India in 2011. We . should not get carried away just yet, not after a display in which . India batted as badly in Southampton as England did at Lord’s, but Moeen . is clearly better than Cook and coach Peter Moores gave him credit for. The . sight of Simon Kerrigan in the second Test squad was evidence that . England were still not convinced about Moeen’s bowling but Cook’s . declaration that he had ‘never seen a bowler improve so . quickly’ showed that this proud  Englishman and proud Muslim will be . underestimated no longer. While . England were expected to wrap up a priceless third Test victory, they could never have imagined it would be all over 10 . minutes before lunch, with Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad both  giving . Cook a celebratory hug. It . was Anderson, back to his absolute best with the ball swinging . throughout in Southampton, who settled any English nerves by striking . with his third ball of the morning and setting the tone with a spell of . two for 11 in six overs. Then . it was over to Moeen, who is learning his art under the spin master . Saeed Ajmal at  Worcestershire and who just needs more bowling now to . develop his  variations and the ‘doosra’ that has rarely been spotted in . this series. The . fact that India’s tail has been so strong in this series means that . none of Moeen’s victims should be under-valued, with the possible . exception of hapless debutant Pankaj Singh, who looks a glorious . throwback to the days of true No11s. Three . of Moeen’s four wickets  were clean bowled, with the other . coming when Bhuvneshwar Kumar edged to gully just after Cook had placed . Anderson there for that very dismissal. Putting up a fight: Ravindra Jadeja plays some shots during India's second innings . That is out: Jadeja is bowled by Moeen Ali as James Anderson  celebrates during day five . Spin king: Ali celebrates taking the wicket of Jadeja . It . was that sort of Test for Cook, who has come through the most searching . examination of his character here, with as many as seven former England . captains calling for his head after the team’s winless run had . stretched to 10 games. Cook . has not exactly turned into Mike Brearley overnight but it was always . likely that his decision- making would become better once he had scored . runs to unclutter his mind and once his team had started performing to . their potential. One . swallow does not make a summer and England will need to back this . display up with another good one at Old Trafford, starting next . Thursday, but their first Test win for fully 353 days will ease the . pressure on a new team still finding its feet. The . giant cloud still hanging over England is today’s disciplinary hearing . against Anderson and there is no question that his absence would leave a . mighty hole in the attack if he is suspended by judicial commissioner . Gordon Lewis. India’s . determination to see Anderson, who has irked them with his sledging, . banished from the rest of the series is very strong while England are . adamant that his brush with Ravindra Jadeja has created a fuss over . nothing. As . India usually get their way in world cricket — as  evidenced by them . being allowed to appeal Jadeja’s fine when no appeal process is . permitted for Level One offences — England might have to prepare for the . worst in Manchester. Neither . Chris Jordan nor Chris Woakes took a wicket in this match and Liam . Plunkett will surely return on an Old Trafford pitch that is expected to . be the quickest and bounciest of this Investec series. Both . Cook and Anderson were quick to point out that Woakes bowled well . without luck but  Jordan had a shocker and it will be interesting to see . whether England keep faith with him at a ground where he thrived in a . one-day international against Sri Lanka earlier this season. Jumping for joy: James Anderson celebrates as he takes the wicket of Rohit Sharma . All square: Anderson helped England make it 1-1 in the series . Nearly there: Alastair Cook (left) and Jos Buttler celebrate afterAnderson (not pictured) takes another wicket . For now that dilemma can wait, with . Moeen — who now has 15 wickets in this series — Gary Ballance, Sam . Robson,  Jordan and Jos Buttler, who was superb with both bat and gloves . on  debut, all celebrating their first win in Test cricket. It . says everything about England’s performance that Cook, Moeen, . Ballance, Buttler and Ian Bell could have been man of the match ahead of . Anderson, who was back to his best for the first time since propelling . England to victory in the first Ashes Test at Trent Bridge last year. He . now has 371 victims, 13 wickets away from overtaking Sir Ian Botham and . becoming the leading wicket-taker in England’s Test history. What . an age ago that Trent Bridge triumph, and subsequent Ashes wins at . Lord’s and Durham, seems. How spectacular and unexpected has been . England’s decline since.

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Jimmy Anderson has been sensationally cleared of a physical assault on India’s Ravindra Jadeja after an Australian judge took just 10 minutes to throw out all charges against both players. England’s insistence that nothing serious happened when Anderson and Jadeja clashed at the bottom of the pavilion staircase at Trent Bridge during the first Test was vindicated in highly embarrassing fashion for India. Gordon Lewis, the hardline Australian judge appointed by the ICC to hear the case, spent six hours listening to evidence from both sides by video link and was then expected to take up to 48 hours to reach his verdict. Spat: Anderson and Jadeja were embroiled in a row as they left the Trent Bridge pitch . Delight: Anderson cannot hide his emotions after dismissing Jadeja at the Ageas Bowl . Yet in a development which left India both stunned and angry the judicial commissioner quickly decided there was no case to answer for either player. It was India who insisted on bringing a highly unusual Level Three charge against Anderson for ‘abusing and pushing’ Jadeja which left him facing a four-Test suspension and expulsion for the rest of a series that England levelled in convincing fashion on Thursday. They were adamant that Anderson had crossed a line in making physical contact with Jadeja after the players had left the outfield at lunch on the second day of the first Test, raising the stakes and forcing both sides to bring in lawyers. Yet England’s belief that India’s provocative move was purely tactical to get their best bowler thrown out of the series was backed up by Lewis’s decision to clear Anderson and uphold India’s appeal against a fine levelled against Jadeja. Leader of the attack: Anderson was man of the match in England's third Test win at the Ageas Bowl . For fourth Test vs India at Old Trafford, starting on August 7 . Cook (c), Ali, Anderson, Ballance,  Bell,  Broad, Buttler (wkt), Jordan, Plunkett, Robson,  Root, Stokes, Woakes. Matt Prior, Stuart Broad and Ben Stokes, the England players closest to the incident, were the main witnesses for Anderson while India coach Duncan Fletcher, captain MS Dhoni and physio Evan Speechly were in Jadeja’s corner. Anderson, man of the match in England’s 266-run victory at the Ageas Bowl, was said to be euphoric after having the potentially serious stain on his record which has been hanging over him during the last two Tests removed. Now, in a huge psychological boost, Anderson will be free to play at his home ground of Old Trafford in next week’s fourth Test after what England will consider almost as big a victory as the one they gained on the field in Southampton over the last week. 'I'm not going to start judging Jimmy Anderson on everything he does and doesn't do,"" he said. 'What I will say is that at the moment we celebrate the fact that he's bowling at his best. 'The whole Test, he's been great. But the spell he bowled on the last morning was a real masterclass of swing bowling. '(It was) on a pitch that was drying, had something in it - but his control of line, length and the decisions he made to put batsmen under pressure was outstanding.'","Anderson found not guilty of Level Three offence by ICC .

"By . Sam Peters . Stuart Broad will undergo surgery on his injured knee at the end of the current Investec Test series against India in a bid to be fit for next year’s World Cup. The 28-year-old England fast bowler has been suffering from patella tendonitis in his right knee for several months but has bowled through the pain barrier this summer after first experiencing significant problems during the Ashes tour last winter. The 6’5” quick has worn a special supportive brace on his knee – originally designed for race horses - this summer which has enabled him to play in all of England’s five Tests so far and should see him play through to the end of the current five-match series. On his knees: Broad is set for surgery after the Test series against India but will play the remaining Tests . He has discussed the possibility of surgery in the past, but sources close to him yesterday confirmed it is ‘highly probable’ he will have his knee operated on shortly after the completion of the final Test at the Oval which finishes August 19. The recovery time for the surgery, which will see tendons in his knee cut and shortened, should be in the region of three to four months, meaning Broad will miss England’s the upcoming five-match ODI series against India as well as the seven-match tour to Sri Lanka in November – but crucially he should be fit for the World Cup in Australia next February. ‘It makes logical sense to have the surgery at the end of this Test series as the focus is then very much on the World Cup,’ a source said. Under strain: Broad has been struggling with his injury throughout this five-Test series . Main men: Broad (second left) and James Anderson (left) are England's attack leaders . Broad has battled manfully through the summer, despite experiencing excruciating pain every time he delivers the ball. The pain got so bad during the second Test at Lord’s that he was forced to take hot baths in the middle of the night in order to ‘get some heat’ through the joint and enable him to get some sleep. ‘At Lord’s I was having hot baths in the middle of the night just to get some warmth through it but I can honestly say that I’m more confident about getting through all five Tests than I have been at any point this summer,’ Broad told Mail Sport on Sunday. Last week’s third Test at Southampton, which saw Broad take three vital wickets, was considered ‘make or break’ for Broad but he was able to bowl relatively pain free and therefore avoided having surgery midway through the summer.","Broad has been struggling with a knee injury throughout Investec series .

"By . Phil Gradwell . Follow @@GraddersOnline . India's Ravindra Jadeja proved he is a proper all-rounder at Old Trafford on Thursday by doing his best Dennis Bergkamp impression. Jadeja, at the centre of the summer's big controversy following his set-to with James Anderson in the Trent Bridge pavilion, was playing football in the outfield and struck a pose reminiscent of the Dutchman's control in a match against Newcastle in 2003. This piece of control is now a statue outside Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. Maybe Jadeja could be better suited to the other Old Trafford after that touch (with an orange Holland ball, as it happens), although India will be hoping he can put his skills to better use with a cricket ball as they look to regain the lead in the series.

All-rounder: Ravindra Jadeja leaps off the ground to control a football, like Dennis Bergkamp (right) in 2003 . No regrets: MS Dhoni (left) says he was right to pursue James Anderson after Trent Bridge . Meanwhile, India captain MS Dhoni said he had no regrets over pursuing the case against Anderson and said it was up to individual captains to control their players. ICC chief executive David Richardson said on Tuesday he would not be appealing against Justice Gordon Lewis’s decision to exonerate both Anderson and Jadeja. India appealed against the original not guilty verdict as they sought to have Anderson punished for a Level Three offence and banned for the rest of the Test series. That did not happen but Dhoni says that if Anderson 'carries on being abusive' he should be punished by the authorities. And the India captain added that match officials should play a greater role in ensuring the game is played in the right spirit: . ‘It’s important that cricket has strong characters – no matter what side they play for,' Dhoni said. 'But what needs to be done is for umpires to step in if the individual crosses the line. If the individual stays within the guidelines, it’s good for the game. ‘If he carries on being abusive and cannot curb his instincts, he should definitely be punished.’ Limbering up: The India players stretch on the outfield prior to their nets session . India, meanwhile, could make three changes to the team who put up so little resistance at Southampton. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin could play his first game of the series, in place of batsman Rohit Sharma, while fast bowler Varun Aaron is in the mix, possibly at the expense of the luckless Pankaj Singh. The tourists could go for experience at the top of the order, too, where Gautam Gambhir might replace Shikhar Dhawan.","MS Dhoni says it's up to captains to control their players .

"By . James Chapman . and Tim Shipman . Nick Clegg delivered what was branded an ‘electoral suicide note’ last night as he boasted of blocking a string of 16 Tory policies. The Deputy Prime Minister pointed out how he had prevented the Government from cutting inheritance tax, scrapping the Human Rights Act and reining in green energy. In an attempt to echo Margaret Thatcher’s famous declaration, Mr Clegg cried ‘no, no, no’ as he cast the Liberal Democrats as a perpetual brake on Conservative excess. Nick Clegg was accused of delivering an 'electoral suicide note' by boasting of blocking 16 Tory policies . The Deputy Prime Minister (pictured embracing wife Miriam) said he had prevented the Government from cutting inheritance tax, scrapping the Human Rights Act and reining in green energy . He used his conference speech to revel in having frustrated his Coalition partners’ attempts to: . ■ Cut inheritance tax . ■ Bring back O-levels . ■ Encourage more providers to run free schools by allowing them to make profits . ■ Relax childcare ratios to reduce costs for parents . ■ Cut employment red tape by allowing no-fault dismissal . ■ Implement regional pay in the public sector . ■ Remove housing benefit from  the under-25s . ■ Ditch the Human Rights Act . ■ Relax the Equalities Act . ■ Automatically renew the Trident nuclear deterrent . ■ Carry on with ‘go home’ poster vans aimed at illegal immigrants . ■ Change constituency boundaries . ■ Scrap Natural England . ■ Limit green energy . ■ Stop geography teachers teaching about climate change . ■ Foil the ‘snoopers’ charter’ Clegg's claims have been ridiculed including his suggestion that there would not have been economic growth without the Liberal Democrats . A senior Tory backbencher quickly labelled Mr Clegg’s list of blocked policies an ‘electoral suicide note’. Addressing activists, Mr Clegg said that in the past, he had ‘always thought it was better to tell people about the things you’ve achieved, not just the things you’ve stopped’. But he said: ‘People do need to know how coalition operates and what we do day in, day out.’ His decision to then reel off 16 policies his party has stymied will be seen as the start of the two Coalition parties distancing themselves from each other ahead of the 2015 general election. But it delighted Conservative MPs, who said he had helped to illustrate what a majority Tory government could achieve after 2015. Mr Clegg rewrote history yesterday, telling his party how he vetoed changes to constituency boundaries after his Tory partners broke a political deal. In August last year he declared the Lib Dems would vote against the changes recommended by an independent commission. The changes would have allowed the Conservatives to gain around another 20 seats at the next election. Mr Clegg said he had acted in retaliation for the Tories’ opposition to his pet project for reform of the House of Lords and said they had broken the Coalition ‘contract’ they had made. In fact the 2010 Coalition deal links boundary changes to the referendum on the Alternative Vote system, not Lords reform. The Coalition agreement  bound the Conservatives simply to set up a committee to suggest changes, which they did. But when the plans came to Parliament, Labour voted against them and the Prime Minister told Mr Clegg he was unable to stop a revolt by 91 of his backbenchers. They also ridiculed his claim that if he had not been in power with the Tories, there would have been no economic growth. Often in coalition, Mr Clegg said, compromise ‘just isn’t possible and you just have to say “No”’. ‘Inheritance tax cuts for millionaires . – No. Bringing back O-levels and a two-tier education system – No. Profit-making in schools – No. New childcare ratios – No. Firing workers . at will, without any reasons given – No, absolutely no. Regional pay . penalising public-sector workers in the North – No,’ he said. ‘Scrapping . housing benefits for young people – No. No to ditching the Human Rights . Act. No to weakening the protections in the Equalities Act.’ The Lib Dem leader also spoke of scuppering Tory plans to make Parliamentary boundaries fairer and resisting Tory attempts to water down green energy plans. ‘No, no and no. The Liberal Democrats will keep this Government green,’ Mr Clegg said. He also appeared in little doubt that the Lib Dems will remain in government after the next election, declaring he could get on with either David Cameron or Ed Miliband – but would ‘do a better job’ than either of them. He said the Lib Dems were ‘no one’s little brother’, earning the loudest cheers as he added: ‘We’re not here to prop up the two-party system, we’re here to bring it down’. His party represented the ‘liberal centre’ as the Tories drifted to the Right and Labour to the Left. He suggested coalitions are now ‘the norm’ for Britain, meaning the Lib Dems could now become a fixture in power, an ‘anchor’ holding back both the Tories and Labour. Mr Clegg condemned ‘bizarre’ Tory views on Britain’s place in Europe, saying leaving would jeopardise millions of jobs and reduce its influence in the world. ‘We are the party of in,’ he declared. Mr Clegg said ‘vitriol’ had been heaped upon him since he entered a power-sharing deal with Mr Cameron in 2010. But he insisted ‘every snipe’ had been worth it ‘because we are turning Britain around’. Former Tory Defence Secretary Liam Fox said of Mr Clegg’s list of blocked policies: ‘Liberal Democrats are showing themselves in their true colours. ‘It’s clear they’re hugely out of step with the policies that Britain wants and needs.’ It appears Nick Clegg was not the only one who worked to slim down ahead of the conference. His wife Miriam looked distinctly more svelte compared with last year (right) as she accompanied him to the keynote speech yesterday (left). Mrs Clegg stood out in a flattering £45.99 Zara coral dress cinched in with a blue belt. She completed her recession-inspired outfit with white Topshop heels . Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘Nick Clegg has just exposed the worst aspects of coalition government. Most people in my constituency would have wanted the reforms Nick Clegg has blocked. The Prime Minister has been governing with one arm tied behind his back. ‘If we could dump Clegg and his merry band of Lefties we would be able to get more welfare reform. The British public want to see a British Bill of Rights rather than the Human Rights Act. ‘In Nick Clegg’s world this list may appeal to the 8 per cent of people who vote Lib Dem but in the rest of the country this is effectively an electoral suicide note.’ Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, said the notion that the Lib Dems should be in every government was ‘bizarre’, and that the approach could backfire, adding: ‘Party leaders should be setting out the things they believe in and the things they would do if elected with a majority, not telling us what they don’t like.’","Nick Clegg told party conference he prevented Government from cutting inheritance tax and reining in green energy .

"By . Ray Massey . A blaze on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane which caused widespread disruption at Heathrow airport last week has been linked to a lithium battery in its emergency beacon, air accident investigators have revealed. The UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the plane’s emergency locator transmitter (ELT) caught fire and had shown indications of disruption to the battery cells which ‘could provide the energy for an ignition’. The ELT is an emergency beacon used to give emergency services and authorities an accurate location for a plane following a crash. Scroll down for video . A blaze on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane which caused widespread disruption at Heathrow airport last week (above) has been linked to a lithium battery in its emergency beacon, air accident investigators have revealed . The ELT beacons, made by U.S. conglomerate Honeywell, are positioned in the upper rear part of the advanced jets, and send a signal that leads rescuers to downed aircraft . The investigators' report notes that the emergency beacon in the stricken aircraft contained a set of lithium-manganese dioxide-based chemical batteries (pictured) which allow it to operate in an emergency . Boeing’s hi-tech flagship ‘plastic plane’ has been dogged with faults since launch and already been grounded worldwide because of battery problems elsewhere in the plane. The new investigators’ report notes that the emergency beacon in the stricken aircraft contained a set of  lithium-manganese dioxide-based chemical batteries which allow  it to operate in an emergency. It said: ‘Detailed examination of the  ELT has shown some indications of disruption to the battery cells. ‘It is not clear however, whether the combustion in the area of the ELT was initiated by a release of energy within the batteries or by an external mechanism such as an electrical short.’ The Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) is an emergency beacon used . to give emergency services and authorities an accurate location for a . plane following a crash. The . beacons, made by U.S. conglomerate Honeywell, are positioned in the . upper rear part of the advanced jets, and send a signal that leads . rescuers to downed aircraft. AAIB said Honeywell had produced some 6,000 ELTs of the same design, which are fitted to a wide range of aircraft. They are powered by non-rechargeable, lithium-manganese batteries. AAIB's . report said aviation regulators should conduct a safety review of . lithium-powered emergency locator beacons in all aircraft types. The ELT history indicated the event was rare, and the fire happened while the aircraft was unoccupied, it said. Boeing said it supported the AAIB's recommendations and reiterated its confidence in the Dreamliner's safety. It said it stood by the plane's 'overall integrity'. The AAIB . recommended that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ensure the . power was turned off in all Honeywell-made ELT systems in the 60-plus . Dreamliners currently in commercial service. A source close to the probe said this could mean removing the ELT's batteries. Honeywell said it did not expect any financial impact from the incident. The . battery linked to the London fire is made by New York-based Ultralife . Corp, according to an industry source. Ultralife did not return calls or . emails seeking comment. But it stresses: ‘In the case of an electrical short, the same batteries could provide the energy for an ignition and suffer damage in the subsequent fire.’ The AAIB today called on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to begin efforts to make the ELT ‘inert’ on all 787 aircraft until the safety of the device can be explored further. Thousands of passengers faced travel chaos last Friday after the aircraft, which has been plagued with problems since its launch, caught fire while on a remote parking stand shortly after 4.30pm. Nobody was on board the Ethiopian Airlines-operated plane at the time of the incident and there were no injuries. Runways were closed to all flights for an hour and a half while emergency crews dealt with the blaze, which caused diversions and long delays for passengers. The AAIB investigation said: ‘The history of this ELT product line indicated that a thermal event is extremely rare. ‘However, large transport aircraft do not typically carry the means of fire detection or suppression in the space above the cabin ceilings and had this event occurred in-flight, it could pose a significant safety concern and raise challenges for the cabin crew in tackling the resulting fire.’ The report said investigations would continue into what triggered the fire in the emergency beacon. Investigators said US aerospace part manufacturer Honeywell, which built the ELT, had been invited to join their probe into the incident. Another different battery problem earlier this year led to delivery delays which caused Thomson Airways to scrap plans to use the ultra-green aircraft in May and June. The carrier finally began Dreamliner services earlier this month. Continuous production difficulties had already plagued the Dreamliner. It should have entered passenger service in 2008 but it was not until October 2011 that the first commercial flight was operated by Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways. British Airways has taken delivery of the first of its 24 Dreamliners, while Virgin Atlantic is due to receive the first of its 16 Dreamliners in September next year. Investigators also called on the FAA to conduct a safety review of installations of similar Lithium-powered ELTs in other aircraft. In a statement, Boeing described the recommendation for the beacons to be immobilised as ‘a precautionary measure’ adding: ‘The safety of passengers and crew members who fly aboard Boeing airplanes is our highest priority.

Analysts cautioned that the British report still left open the question of how the fire actually started. 'This is not really what you call a conclusive answer,' said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation consultant with the Teal Group. 'There's . nothing about this finding that indicates a lack of safety with the . plane, but on the other hand there's no conclusive proof that a system . unrelated to the plane is to blame. Shares in Boeing rose 2.6 percent to $107.40, closing in on the all-time high of $108.15, set just before the fire was reported. Loren Thompson, a U.S.-based analyst and consultant with close ties to . industry, said the UK recommendation did not call into question the . airworthiness of the 787, which offered some good news for Boeing. 'The Honeywell device is simply a beacon for locating the aircraft in an . accident, so it has no bearing on the flight worthiness of the plane,' Thompson said.

"By . John Preston . A quarter of a century ago, a young oil executive called Justin Welby had a meeting with the then Bishop of Kensington. Welby was interested in becoming a Church of England vicar and the Bishop agreed to see him to assess his suitability. The meeting did not go well. At the end of it the Bishop told him bluntly: ‘You have no future in the Church of England.’ None the less, Welby managed to get  a second interview — with the vicar of  St Mary Abbots in Kensington. This didn’t go well either. When he was asked what he would do if he visited a female parishioner who needed help with a blocked drainpipe, Welby replied that he would send his wife up a ladder to clear it — his wife being a lot better at DIY than he was. Unshowy and unstuffy: The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who joined the Church of England 25 years ago . Remarkably, he was then sent for a third interview with the Bishop of Maidstone, who asked what he would do if he was turned down. Welby laughed and said he would ‘take my wife out for the most expensive meal I can afford to celebrate’. Jump forward a quarter of a century and Welby is now the Archbishop of Canterbury. His predecessor, Rowan Williams, famously said that he would need the constitution of an ox and the skin of a rhinoceros. On the face of it, Welby had neither. Ecclesiastically speaking, he was very much the Man from Nowhere having only been a bishop for four-and-a-half months when he was appointed. No one with less experience had been given the top job since the 17th century. Yet, two years on, Welby is generally reckoned to be making a pretty good fist of it. He’s just managed to persuade the General Synod to back women bishops while successfully appeasing the traditionalists. In marked contrast to several predecessors, he is unshowy, unstuffy and prefers to travel by public transport — so much so, the Lambeth Palace chauffeur has taken early retirement. And while he has never hidden his opposition to gay marriage, none other than the normally implacable gay activist Peter Tatchell has declared that he is ‘a genuine, sincere,  open-minded person’. Tough job: The role of Archbishop of Canterbury is not an easy one, but two years on, Welby is generally reckoned to be making a pretty good fist of it . As this new biography reveals, there is far more to Welby than you might think from his rather bland and doughy exterior. If you’re looking for a rational explanation for why he has embraced certainties so wholeheartedly, you might find it in the swirling chaos of his childhood. His father was an alcoholic fantasist who by a barely credible quirk of fate was once engaged to Vanessa Redgrave. His parents’ marriage collapsed after three years and though Welby had an ostensibly privileged upbringing — Eton followed by Cambridge — life at home was far from easy. At school he showed no interest in religion. The only interesting thing he can remember happening in chapel at Eton was when the headmaster fell out of the pulpit. Overcoming tragedy: Welby and his wife Caroline say their daughter's death brought them closer to God . While he didn’t do well in exams — his  A-level grades were C, D and E — he scraped into Cambridge to study law. There, he attended chapel occasionally, but only for the music; he was more interested in rowing. But then, shortly after the start of his second year, something extraordinary happened. One evening Welby was persuaded to go to chapel by a friend of his. He sat through the sermon ‘bored out of my mind’, then went back to his friend’s rooms. There, they began to talk about what it meant to be a Christian. ‘And suddenly I saw the grace, the freedom, the free giving of God, which meant that to follow him would not be constraining but would be the most ultimately liberating thing I could ever do.’ It wasn’t long before Welby’s new faith was put to perhaps the greatest test of all. In 1983 his wife, Caroline, and their seven-month-old daughter, Joanna, were in a car crash in France. The child was thrown from the car and suffered a fatal head injury. Both Welby and his wife believed the tragedy brought them closer to God. Indeed, Caroline said that while she was sitting at the side of the road waiting for the ambulance to come she’d had ‘one of the most powerful experiences of God I have ever had’. Neither has wavered since. When Welby left his job in the oil industry to become a vicar, his former boss remarked that it was the only known case of a rat joining a sinking ship. But as far as Welby was concerned, it was a ship ripe for re-floating and launching in a new, more clearly defined direction. A graduate of  the Alpha Course at Holy Trinity Brompton — set up by his fellow Old Etonian and Cambridge contemporary, Nicky Gumbel — Welby has proved to be a canny mix of the inflexible and the expedient. Etonian: Justin Welby, aged 18, pictured as he was leaving Eton School . While he still believes homosexuality is against the will of God, his stance may have softened since he became Archbishop — he’s pro civil partnerships and made it plain the Church ‘must have no truck with homophobia’. As Andrew Atherstone states in his introduction, this is not an authorised biography — but neither is it entirely unauthorised: various friends and colleagues of Welby’s were given the  all-clear to talk to him. The result . is a solid, fair-minded and scrupulously researched affair which . unfortunately lacks a quality that Welby seems to possess in abundance: . humour. He’s got an appealingly dry, self-deprecating wit, once . describing himself in his archbishop’s robes as looking like ‘a . self-propelled toadstool with a pointy hat’. By . an odd coincidence, I was at prep school with Justin Welby, though I . can’t say I remember him and very much doubt if he remembers me. I . did, however, come across this description of the Battle of Waterloo in . the school magazine written when Welby was 12: ‘Wellington looked sad . as he picked his way past the ruins of a gun with its crew sprawled . around it.

"By . Hamish Mackay . Follow @@H_Mackay . Leicester are trying to sign Argentina midfielder Esteban Cambiasso ahead of their Premier League return against Everton. The Foxes are in negotiations with the 33-year-old former Real Madrid and Inter Milan player, who is a free agent after leaving the Italian giants at the end of last season. Manager Nigel Pearson had been hoping to keep any deal secret until an agreement could be reached but news of the potential signing was leaked last week to a national newspaper, much to Pearson's annoyance. But he insists a deal - which would be a major coup for the club - is still possible. 'I don't know about Cambiasso,' said Pearson. 'I don't take too much notice of the air waves. I've not denied our interest. It's something we will continue to work at. Inter: Esteban Cambiasso, who played more than 300 games for Inter, is wanted by Leicester . 'Whether deals can be done or not it will be based on a number of criteria. We'll work really hard to do the deals. I can't account for other circumstances intervening. 'We have an interest yeah. But my view on talking on other people's players [is] I don't. I don't have a track record of talking about speculation.' Leicester, back in the Premier League after a decade-long absence, begin their campaign against Everton at the King Power Stadium on Saturday. The Foxes enjoyed a hugely successful campaign last season, in which they secured promotion with six matches to spare before clinching the Championship title with an away win at Bolton on April 22. It was the club's first ever Football League title, achieved with 31 victories and 102 points - both club records. The Premier League is a very different animal but Pearson believes his squad is capable of thriving in the top flight. Manager: Nigel Pearson guided Leicester back to the Premier League after a 10-year absence . 'I think it's dangerous to set your targets too low,' he said. 'It's very difficult to have a definitive answer to what might constitute a successful season. 'From a business point of view - and purely on a business level - survival would be an achievement. But, of course, I can't preach that as that would be under-selling what we have the potential to do. 'I feel we have a good squad with a good mix of experience and young players who, if they are brought through and nurtured in the right way and given time, will see us do very well in the Premier League. 'Our biggest strength is our team and group ethic. Alone, that's not enough, but we have a lot of quality in our side too. Injury: Marc Albrighton picked up a groin injury and is likely to miss the Everton game . 'But the Premier League and the Championship are very different. Last season was a great success, but it's in the past. We're all very proud of what we achieved but it's about moving on and being a success in the Premier League now. Jamie Vardy (thigh) and summer signing Marc Albrighton (groin) are likely to miss the visit of Everton but French winger Anthony Knockaert, who has been nursing an ankle problem, is expected to be fit. Pearson said: 'Marc may not make the weekend but Anthony has trained fully. Jamie Vardy is unlikely to be available. It is frustrating when you pick up one or two knocks up in pre-season, we've been a bit unfortunate. 'If one player misses someone else has got an opportunity. But however we shape up at the weekend we will be very capable.'","Esteban Cambiasso wanted by Leicester, admits Nigel Pearson .

"By . Matthew Dennison . At Belvoir Castle before the war, a kitchen staff of 20 catered for the ninth Duke of Rutland and his family. Teenage boys scrubbed copper pans, standing on duckboards to lift their feet out of the suds. Maids made everything from jam to crystallised violets. In rare moments of leisure, the Scottish cook, Mrs Anderson, read tea leaves. Distinctive widow's peak: Cecil Beaton's portrait of Lady Ursula, aged 21, taken in 1939 . Upstairs and outside, the Duke’s butler, the housekeeper, footmen, gardeners, the pig man, wood-cutters, odd job men, nannies and nurserymaids ran the many- turreted Regency castle ‘at full throttle . . . like a cross between a luxury hotel, a museum and a theatre’, remembers Lady Ursula d’Abo. There was an upholstery workshop and, in the tack room, saddles embellished with silver. At the centre of an estate of more than 15,000 acres, Belvoir was the Duke’s private fiefdom. His Sunday morning routine included a visit to the dairy to sample the cheese after a service in the castle chapel. This was the world — lavish, aristocratic, rarefied — in which Lady Ursula, the eldest of the Duke’s five children and now 98-year-old great-aunt of the present 11th Duke of Rutland, spent much of her childhood. Lady Ursula’s memories range from Downton-style Christmas parties for estate workers — at which, one year, every servant was given a gift of an orange and a lemon — to being photographed in an antique silver wine cooler large enough to hold two children. In the castle Muniment Room, she discovered a letter from Charles II in which he addressed his downtrodden wife Catherine of Braganza as ‘my dear little whiffy-whoffy’. Lady Ursula did not go to school, but was educated at home. Lavish childhood: Ursula and her sister Isabel sitting in a 17th-century silver punch bowl . Aristocratic upbringing: A portrait by Charles Edmund Brock of Ursula, her brother Charles and sister Isabel . In London she took swimming, ballet and piano lessons. She was ‘finished’ in Paris. She officially ‘came out’ when she was 17, at a grand ball at Belvoir, wearing a dress by Worth. To mark this, her father presented her with a large, heart-shaped aquamarine brooch he had designed himself. It featured her name in diamonds. She describes her education as ‘all the traditional home pursuits: cooking, sewing and running a large house’. With hindsight, she recognises the degree to which she was spoiled, but dismisses it simply as ‘just the way it was’. As a child, Ursula envied her younger sister Isabel’s boisterous and easy manner with young men. Pale-skinned, with ink-dark hair, Ursula adored her father and felt uncomfortable with men of her own age. Estate of 15,000 acres: Ursula on horseback outside Belvoir Castle lodge for a meet of the Belvoir Hunt . From early in her life she was drawn to father figures. Later she would famously live with John Paul Getty, who asked her to marry him — she declined. In 1976, People magazine reported that Getty had left her shares worth $165,000 in his will. There were 40,000 children at the Coronation procession in London . It was the coronation of George VI that changed her life. Ursula Manners (as she then was) was one of the train-bearers to Queen Elizabeth. It was a nerve-racking experience, despite so many other family members also being involved: her father carried the orb, her mother carried the Queen’s canopy, two of her brothers were royal pages. The beautiful Lady in Waiting: Ursula (third from left) with King George VI, Queen Elizabeth, Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret on the Buckingham Palace balcony in 1937 after the coronation . But it was Ursula who was photographed . standing behind the King and Queen on Buckingham Palace balcony. Those . photographs were printed in newspapers across the globe and Ursula, with . her distinctive  widow’s peak hairline, became famous overnight. Happy existence: Ursula at home in her Kensington flat in 1997 . An American magazine published a poem in which each verse began with the line: ‘Who is that beautiful Lady in Waiting?’ Celebrity, however, had never been the Duke’s aim for his daughter. He intended her to marry a man like himself, preferably another duke. One of Lady Ursula’s boyfriends was, indeed, the future Duke of Buccleuch. Instead, she married a handsome barrister called Anthony Marreco. After the war, they were divorced and she married her second husband, Erland d’Abo, with whom she had three children. Later Erland’s nephew Mike d’Abo became famous as the lead singer with Manfred Mann. Aristocratic memoirs invariably combine unimaginable privilege with hefty dollops of dysfunctionalism, emotional suffering and, often, addiction or substance abuse in some shape or form. Not so The Girl With The Widow’s Peak. Though Lady Ursula’s personal life has included its share of heartache — divorce, widowhood, the death of the father she idolised aged only 53, and a car crash that involved extensive reconstructive facial surgery — her autobiography depicts a happy family existence. It is a precious window on to a vanished world.","At the coronation of George VI, Lady Ursula was a train-bearer to Queen Elizabeth .

"By . James Nye For Mailonline . Two German artists have come forward to claim responsibility for the white flags that mysteriously appeared on the Brooklyn Bridge last month. The Berlin-based artists claim their stunt, which severely embarrassed the NYPD, was not designed to cause a terror scare, but to celebrate the beauty of the bridge and mark the death of its German-born engineer. Mischa Leinkauf, 37, and Matthis Wermke, 35, outed themselves as the cultprits to The New York Times on Tuesday, but attempted to diffuse the reaction to their escapade by denying the stunt was anti-American and promised to return the two huge flags they stole the night of July 22. Scroll Down for the Video . Admission: German artists Matthis Wermke, 35, (left) and Mischa Leinkauf, 37, (right) claim to have erected white flags atop the Brooklyn Bridge in July for as a work of art . Culprits have come forward? A white flag flies on the Brooklyn Bridge, in Brooklyn, New York, USA, 22 July 2014 - allegedly placed there by two German artists . 'We saw the bridge, which was designed by a German, trained in Berlin, who came to America because it was the place to fulfill his dreams, as the most beautiful expression of a great public space,' said Leinkauf to The New York Times in a phone call from Germany. 'That beauty was what we were trying to capture.' The two urban artists claim they scaled the suspension cables of the iconic Brooklyn Bridge before sunrise on July 22, which was the 145th anniversary of the death of John Augustus Roebling. The two German artists said they can prove they removed and replaced the flags, but offered up scant evidence to The New York Times in the shape of grainy and jerky video shot from the top. Embarrassment: The NYPD was shamed when the two Old Glories atop the Brooklyn Bridge were removed in the early hours of July 22 and replaced with two white flags . Mischa Leinkauf and Mattias Wermke said on Tuesday they removed the bridge's American flags and posted the white flags early July 22 in celebration of public art. They say July 22 marked the 145th anniversary of German-born bridge architect John August Roebling's death. They say they're returning the American flags . The artists, who have sought legal representation in light of the furious reaction from the shamed NYPD, have said that they are coming forward to explain their art according to USA Today. They claim that between the hours of 3am and 5am they carried one 11-foot by 20-foot to each of the bridge's two stone towers, and replaced the Stars and Stripes flying at the Manhattan and Brooklyn ends. The artists made it specifically clear that they followed the time honored US Flag Code when the removed the 12-foot by 18-foot Old Glories from the bridge. Trying to head off any more criticism, the two artists, who have been stunned by the response to their artistic project, have promised to return them. They have not said how they will do this though. Claims investigated:  Deputy Commissioner Stephen Davis says the investigation is continuing. He says detectives are trying to determine if more than two people were involved in the flag switch. The artists first made their claim of responsibility to The New York Times. Two German artists have claimed responsibility for the white flags that mysteriously appeared on the Brooklyn Bridge last month. Police say they're aware of the artists' statements but won't say whether investigators had identified them as suspects before they came forward . Claiming they acted alone, the Germans claimed that they saw no security cameras when they scaled the Brooklyn Bridge. When the NYPD realized in the morning that a major security breach had occurred at one of the top terror targets in New York City, specialists spent hours conducting a thorough sweep of the bridge for devices. Contrary to the artists claims, the NYPD have repeatedly said they are looking to speak to 'four persons of interest' seen on security camera at around 3am on July 22. Despite seeking legal representation, the pair have said they are open to return to the US to face the music. 'We always face the consequences,' Leinkauf said. 'This is part of the work, to have an open discussion. We just needed a little time to decide how to respond to the reaction.' Stephen Davis, NYPD's chief spokesman said to the Times they should come back: 'If they want to come in and speak with us, we certainly would be more than happy to entertain them.' Leinkauf and Wermke both claim to have used public spaces in the past to conduct their public art in Europe, but without having caused such a commotion. However, they admitted to The New York Times, 'we did not have the same problems with terrorism.'","German artists Mischa Leinkauf and Matthis Wermke claim they were responsible for flying the white flags over Brooklyn Bridge in July .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Two University of Texas football players were arrested and charged Thursday with felony sexual assault after a female student said she was raped in a campus dorm room last month. Wide receivers Kendall Sanders, 20, and Montrel Meander, 19, were in custody at the university police station. According to an arrest affidavit, Sanders and Meander texted each other during earlier interviews with police to 'get their story straight' and Sanders also faces a charge of improper photography tied to the alleged assault on June 21. First-year Longhorns coach Charlie Strong, who will welcome his team to preseason training camp in two weeks, said he had suspended both players. Kendall Sanders, 20, (left) and Montrel Meander, 19, (right) forced themselves on a friend after Meander brought her back to his dorm room for sex, police say . Walked free: University of Texas football players Kendall Sanders, center, and Montrel Meander, right, walked out of jail after posting $95,000 and $75,000 bail - respectively . 'We've been monitoring and addressing the situation with Kendall and Montrel since it was brought to our attention,' Strong said in a statement released by the school. 'It's been made clear to everyone on our team that treating women with respect is one of our core values, and I'm extremely disappointed that two young men in our program have been accused of not doing that.' The sexual assault charges carry prison terms of two to 20 years. Telephone messages left with attorneys for both players were not immediately returned. According to arrest affidavits filed by police, the alleged victim knew both men. Police said they were called to her dorm at 3.43am and found the woman under an entryway service desk, crying, barefoot and disheveled. The women told police she had gone to Austin's Sixth Street entertainment district with friends and agreed to return to Meander's dorm where they began to have consensual sex. Sanders then knocked on the door and Meander let him in, according to police. The woman said Meander went into the bathroom and that Sanders forced her to have vaginal and anal sex. Sanders is a junior wide receiver for the Longhorns football team. He made nine starts last year . Meander, also a wide receiver, is a red shirt freshman. He was set to start training camp with the Longhorns in just two weeks . Meander returned and joined the assault despite her telling both of them to stop, according to police. She told police that she also suspected that Sanders used his mobile phone to take a picture or video of her. Detectives separately interviewed both players at the university police station. Police said the players agreed to let police look at pictures on their phones and detectives said they found at least one photo of the victim. 'The university campus must be an environment free from all sexual assault and violence,' Texas President Bill Powers said. 'At the University of Texas at Austin, student safety is our top priority and we are involved with the national efforts to prevent a culture of sexual violence from taking root on campuses. We educate all of our students about preventing sexual assault and vigorously investigate all allegations so we can take the appropriate action.' Sanders, a junior, has played in 23 career games and started seven last year. He has 39 career receptions for 376 yards and one touchdown. Sanders was suspended for the 2013 season opener after a drunken-driving arrest. Meander is a redshirt freshman who did not play last season.","The student had known both Montrel Meander and Kendall Sanders for more than a year .

"By . James  Nye . and Associated  Press Reporter . A Florida teenager had his right arm ripped to shreds after a terrifying encounter with a barracuda that jumped out of the water while he was fishing with his dad on Sunday. Parker King, 13, nearly bled to death after the attack which happened 20 miles offshore from Port Orange and led to a frantic race by his father, Irwin, to get back to shore in time. The drama began when the father and son team spotted the large barracuda and decided to try and catch the notoriously volatile fish. Injuries: Parker King recovers in hospital after his close brush with death after a barracuda attack on Sunday off the coast of Florida . Vessel: This is the boat that Irwin and Parker King were fishing out of when they suffered the barracuda attack . 'We seen him and he was big and we were like, 'This should be a fun little fight.'  But it wasn't.  It wasn't,' said Irwin King. The barracuda, an aggressive species of fish which can grow up to seven-feet in length and boasts razor sharp teeth, was snared by the father-son fishing team. 'In a split second, he went from there, up over the boat and just nailed him right on the upper chest/' King told Local 6. The wounds Parker suffered were extensive and he began bleeding fast, all over his father's small fishing boat. Team: Irwin and Parker pictured (left) before their father-son bonding trip and Irwin, (right) explains how it unexpectedly became a very close run thing . Earlier: This is one of the barracuda's caught by the King's before Sunday's attack . The real dilemma was due to their distance from the shore. At over 20 miles out there was no phone reception and no way to call a helicopter to come and fetch them. So, Irwin King just turned back toward shore and went to full speed. 'It's still flopping in the back of the boat and I started going, just heading, I mean, it was not a fun ride.  It was a bouncy ride and I really didn't care. I didn't care if parts were flying off the boat, I just wanted to get him in,' recalled King. With only a spare towel wrapped around his wounds to stem the bleeding, Parker's life was in the balance. 'I was praying that he wasn't going to run out of blood,' said King. Parker is now recovering in hospital and according to his dad, has a new found respect for the fish he is trying to catch. 'The fish won on that one.  He got us, he got Parker. He was a champ, I mean, he was a champ,' said Irwin King.","Parker King was on fishing trip with his father, Irwin, off the coast of Port Orange, Florida .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Two small planes went down in separate crashes in northern Arizona Sunday, leaving six people dead, authorities said. One of the crashes also caused a fire that burned well over 25 acres of land. The Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said four died when a plane crashed near Sedona. The Federal Aviation Administration said hikers in the Bear Mountain area reported the crash and a possible fire around 3 p.m. PDT Sunday. Smoke from a fire sparked by the crash of a single-engine plane rises over Fay Canyon, near Sedona, Arizona, on July 20, 2014 . The sheriff's office says fire crews found the single-engine plane about 6 p.m. in Fay Canyon. The Arizona Republic reported that firefighters, including helicopters and ground crews, responded. Later, authorities said a small plane crashed in northern Arizona's Mohave County near the Utah border, killing two people. Sgt. John T. Bottoms of the Arizona Department of Public Safety told Salt Lake City's KSL-TV that the crash occurred about 6:30 PDT. The FAA says that the plane went down 'under unknown circumstances' and was on fire. The Fay Canyon Trailhead is closed, the National Forest said, because of the fire, which is slowly moving both north and west . Fay is a shady canyon with a stone arch and a diverse collection of plant life, known for its wildflowers . Bottoms said that crews hiked to reach the plane, which was on a ledge, and used water backpacks to extinguish the blaze. There was no word Sunday on the identities of any of the dead or the causes of the crashes. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate both crashes.","First crash occurred about 3pm Sunday in Fay Canyon, near Sedona, killing four .

The latest version of the company's Sienna minivan has a feature called 'Driver Easy Speak.' It uses a built-in microphone to amplify a parent's voice through speakers in the back seats. Toyota says it added Easy Speak 'so parents don't have to shout to passengers in the back.' But chances are many parents will yell into the microphone anyway. Family wagon: Toyota has revamped its Sienna minivan to make it sleeker and more appealing . Can they hear you now? The minivan comes with the new 'Driver Easy Speak' feature, which uses a built-in microphone to amplify a parent's voice through speakers in the back seats . Helpful: the 'Driver Easy speak' technology works only one way, so the kids' voices will not be amplified . And the feature only works one way, so the kids can't talk back. At least not with amplified voices. The feature is an option on the 2015 Sienna, which is being refreshed with a totally new interior. It also has an optional 'pull-down conversation mirror' that lets drivers check on kids without turning around. Automakers are trying to come up with creative ways to make the out-of-fashion minivan more appealing, said Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst at the Edmunds.com automotive website. Last year Honda unveiled a vacuum cleaner built into the back of its revamped Odyssey minivan that got a lot of attention. Such features are important because there's little automakers can do to make the practical but bland vans more stylish, Caldwell said. 'I think they're on the right lines of trying to find these features that people are going to talk about,' she said. I see you: The 2015 Sienna has an optional 'pull-down conversation mirror' that lets drivers check on kids without turning around . More relaxing drives: Toyota says it added Easy Speak 'so parents don't have to shout to passengers in the back' Minivan sales peaked at 1.37 million in 2000, but fell as low as 415,000 in 2009, when auto sales bottomed during the Great Recession. Sales have risen as the market rebounded, and last year people bought just under 519,000 of the vans. But Caldwell said the minivan share of the market now is holding steady at 3.4 percent, less than half the share from peak years. Some new products are entering the minivan market despite its decline. Ford is rolling out a new family hauler based on the Transit Connect small commercial van and Chrysler is working on a revamp of its Town & Country minivan. Toyota is unveiling the new Sienna mainly through social media and at a Baltimore arts festival this weekend. It's due to hit showrooms in the fall. 'Driver Easy Speak' is available only on vans equipped with Toyota's Entune premium audio systems. Prices of the van and the voice feature were not announced.","New Toyota Sienna comes with 'Driver Easy Speak' feature that uses a built0in microphone to amplify parents' voice in backseat .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Secretary of State John Kerry is heading back to the Middle East as the Obama administration attempts to bolster regional efforts to reach a ceasefire and sharpens its criticism of Hamas in its conflict with Israel. The State Department said Kerry would leave early on Monday for Egypt where he will join diplomatic efforts to resume a truce that had been agreed to in November 2012. In a statement on Sunday evening, department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called the U.S. and international partners 'deeply concerned about the risk of further escalation, and the loss of more innocent life.' Scroll down for video . Secretary of State John Kerry is heading back to the Middle East as the Obama administration attempts to bolster regional efforts to reach a ceasefire and sharpens its criticism of Hamas in its conflict with Israel . The Obama administration has toned down . its earlier rebuke of Israel for attacks on the Gaza Strip that have . killed civilians, including children, although both President Barack . Obama and Kerry expressed concern about the rising death toll. The U.S. will urge the militant Palestinian group to accept a cease-fire agreement that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting with Israel. More than 430 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have been killed in that time. Cairo has offered a cease-fire plan that is backed by the U.S. and Israel. But Hamas has rejected the Egyptian plan and is relying on governments in Qatar and Turkey for an alternative proposal. Qatar and Turkey have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, which is also linked to Hamas but banned in Egypt. Making the rounds of Sunday talk shows, Kerry pointed to Hamas' role in the violence. Palestinians dance while flying a Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement flag reading in Arabic 'there is only one God and Muhammad is his prophet' during celebrations in the West bank city of Ramallah on Sunday . 'It's ugly. War is ugly, and bad things are going to happen,' Kerry told ABC's This Week. But, he added, Hamas needs 'to recognize their own responsibility.' Both Obama and Kerry said Israel has a right to defend itself against frequent rocket attacks by Hamas from the Gaza Strip. Kerry accused Hamas of attempting to sedate and kidnap Israelis through a network of tunnels that militants have used to stage cross-border raids. He said on CNN's State Of The Union that Hamas must 'step up and show a level of reasonableness, and they need to accept the offer of a cease-fire.' Then, Kerry said, 'we will certainly discuss all of the issues relevant to the underlying crisis.' The nearly two-week conflict appeared to be escalating as U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon was already in the region to try to revive cease-fire efforts. Obama, in a telephone call Sunday, told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Kerry was coming to the Mideast and condemned Hamas' attacks, according to a White House statement. Smoke rises after an Israeli missile strike in Gaza City, in the northern Gaza Strip, on Sunday . The U.N. relief agency in Gaza estimates that 70,000 Palestinians have fled their homes in the fighting and are seeking shelter in schools and other shelters the United Nations has set up. The relief agency's top director in Gaza, Robert Turner, told CNN's State Of The Union that the U.N. has run out of mattresses for refugees and few hygiene and medical supplies are left, although fresh food and water remain available. 'People are scared,' Turner said. 'They don't feel safe at home, they don't feel safe with their families or neighbors. They feel relatively safe in our installations. ... We frankly have been overwhelmed by the numbers.' He said more than 1,000 homes in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged beyond repair, and at least 13,000 lightly damaged. U.S. officials made clear, however, that Hamas could bring relief to the Palestinian people if it agrees to a cease-fire proposed by Egypt - a view that Netanyahu is pushing as well. Palestinian medics carry a man injured in Gaza City's Shijaiyah neighborhood that came under fire: Some 380 Palestinians and seven Israelis have been killed in the nearly two-week conflict . Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Forces Committee, urged Israel to 'stay as long as you need to stay, go wherever you need to go, do deal with a viper's nest called Hamas.' 'If it's left up to Hamas, thousands of Israelis would be dead,' Graham, R-S.C., told NBC's Meet The Press. Netanyahu agreed. In an ABC interview, he said Israel has tried to avoid killing Palestinian civilians through phone calls, text messages and leaflets dropped on their communities. But Hamas doesn't 'give a whit about the Palestinians,' Netanyahu said. 'All they want is more and more civilian deaths.' The prime minister said his top goal is to restore a sustainable peace, but then will ask the international community to consider demilitarizing Gaza to rid Hamas of its rockets and shut down the tunnels leading into Israel. Gaza City came under heavy tank fire on Sunday as Israel widened its ground offensive against Hamas, causing hundreds of panicked residents to flee . Netanyahu brushed off a question about giving concessions to Hamas as a step toward peace, including releasing Palestinian prisoners or loosening border crossings. 'Hamas doesn't care,' Netanyahu said. 'I think the last thing you want to do is reward them.' Kerry also said any cease-fire agreement must be without conditions or 'any rewards for terrorist behavior.' He did not mention the Qatari or Turkish efforts. Kerry also blamed the latest wave of violence on what he called Israel's 'legitimate' efforts to pursue and punish those who last month kidnapped and killed three Israeli teenagers whose bodies were found in the West Bank. Their deaths were followed almost immediately by what authorities believe was a retribution attack on a Palestinian youth who was strangled, beaten and burned to death. Palestinians launch fireworks during celebrations in the West bank city of Ramallah, late Sunday after the Hamas' armed wing said it captured an Israeli soldier during fighting in the Gaza Strip . Tensions between Israel and Palestinian authorities have been simmering for years. They threatened to boil over this spring when Israel shelved nearly nine months of peace negotiations that were being personally shepherded by Kerry after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to create a unity government with Hamas. 'No country could sit by and not take steps to try to deal with people who are sending thousands of rockets your way,' Kerry said. Kerry spoke Sunday on all five major news network talk shows: NBC's Meet The Press, CNN's State Of The Union, ABC's This Week, CBS' Face The Nation and Fox News Sunday.","Secretary of State headed for Egypt .

"By . Lydia Warren . Arrest: Jade Jacobs, 35, allegedly kept her daughter in a tiny room covered in her feces and urine . A 15-year-old girl was forced to live on a tiny waste-soaked mat by her parents, who beat and starved her until she weighed just 60lbs, police have said. The girl, who doctors believe has autism or another learning disability, was left earlier this month at an Atlanta hospital by her mother, who said she 'could not do it anymore', the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The 35-year-old mother, Jade Marie Jacobs, was arrested on malicious child cruelty and authorities in Gwinnett County are still looking for her husband, William Brown, 40, to charge him with the same. After the mother went to the hospital, police went to the couple's home - where the family had only lived for a few weeks - and found the girl's allegedly grim living conditions. They came across a tiny room containing a 2ft by 2ft mat, which they believed the girl was forced to live on. 'There was a . tile floor with a small two-by-two foot mat along with some clothes . that were stained with feces and urine,' Gwinnett Police Cpl. Ed Ritter . told WSB. 'There were actually feces on the floor and the entire room smelled of feces and urine.' Search: Police are now looking for the girl's stepfather, William Brown, pictured with an unidentified woman . Authorities . also found three other girls, aged nine, 11 and 13, living at the home. These girls did not show any signs of abuse but have been taken in by . social services, the AJC reported. Doctors . said the teen had cuts and bruises consistent with beatings, while . pressure sores suggested she had been kept for a long time in a small . place, the police report said. Jacobs told the hospital that her daughter's bruises were from a fight with her sisters and that she was so underweight because she refused to eat - but nurses said she was desperate to eat. The girl may have a learning disability because of an injury she received as a baby while living in . Baltimore, Maryland, Ritter said. That case prompted a criminal investigation, he said. Scene: The couple had three other girls living at their home but they did not show any signs of abuse . Records seen by MailOnline show she was charged with child abuse, second-degree assault and reckless endangerment in 2000. The records note the charges stemmed from putting the baby in hot bath water. In this latest case, Jacobs was denied bond after a judge deemed she was a threat to the allegedly abused girl. Authorities are still searching for Brown, a truck driver who is believed to be the girls' stepfather.","Jade Jacobs, 35, left the girl at an Atlanta hospital earlier this month saying she 'could not do it anymore'

"By . Jim Norton . The Queen has visited HMS Lancaster - known as the Queen’s Frigate - 24 years after she launched it. The crew welcomed Her Majesty on board the Royal Navy Frigate yesterday as it stopped off at Portsmouth Naval Base. Dressed elegantly in a sky blue Karl Ludwig dress and a white Angela Kelly hat, the 88-year-old was greeted by the naval base commander Commodore Jeremy Rigby and received a royal salute. Scroll down for video . Figurehead: The Queen stands at the bow of HMS Lancaster as crew members stand behind her with the ship in dock at Portsmouth in Hampshire.

The national anthem played as she inspected a guard of honour, before she met members of the crew and their families on board at a private lunch. The Queen, who is the ship’s sponsor in her capacity as the Duke of Lancaster, officially launched the Type 23 frigate on May 24, 1990. HMS Lancaster has travelled more than 30,000 miles in the North Atlantic and Caribbean between May and December 2013, making a total of 20 port visits. Hats off: Queen Elizabeth II receives 'three cheers for Her Majesty' from the ship's company. HMS Lancaster has recently returned from a seven month deployment in the North Atlantic and Caribbean . Queen Elizabeth II shares a joke with Commander Peter Laughton, Commanding Officer of HMS Lancaster as she visits Portsmouth Naval Base for a tour of the the ship. In the background crew members stand to attention . During its deployment, it was involved in six drugs busts -  detaining 23 drug-runners and seizing 1.2 tonnes of cocaine and nearly 1.5 tonnes of cannabis, which would worth £160 million on the streets of the UK. The Queen has previously visited the impressive ship in 2004 and 2006. Commander Peter Laughton, the ship’s commanding officer, said: ‘We are honoured with a visit from our Lady Sponsor, Her Majesty the Queen, who launched the ship in 1990. Dressed elegantly in a sky blue Karl Ludwig dress and a white Angela Kelly hat, the 88-year-old was greeted by the naval base commander Commodore Jeremy Rigby and received a royal salute . ‘It provides us with an excellent opportunity to update Her Majesty on HMS Lancaster’s recent activities including our successful counter-narcotics deployment in the North Atlantic and Caribbean. ‘Throughout this, Lancaster remained poised to respond to any natural disaster and ready to provide life saving support. ‘I am extremely proud of my ship’s company who worked tirelessly over a seven month period on the front line of naval operations and ultimately protecting our nation’s interests.’ Queen Elizabeth II also met members of the Boarding Team who were involved in successful counter-narcotics operations with HMS Lancaster. Lancaster’s weapon engineer officer Lieutenant Commander Adrian Gubby said: ‘Lancaster has the privilege of being The Queen’s frigate. Seven months was a long time to be away from friends and family, however the success of the deployment made the time away worth it.’ Able seaman Andrew Warry, 19, from Portsmouth, said: ‘I feel really privileged, it’s nice to see it’s getting noticed, that it’s not just a job, it’s a career and you feel a part of something.’ Red carpet treatment: The Queen, who is the ship's sponsor in her capacity as the Duke of Lancaster, officially launched the Type 23 frigate on May 24, 1990.

"By . Jim Norton . and Tania Steere . An ITV producer has quit after it emerged the broadcaster paid for students to drink potentially lethal amounts of alcohol for an investigation. A production team picked up the bar bill for four students during a probe into binge drinking among the young. One youngster filmed for the programme drank a potentially deadly 48 units of alcohol – the equivalent of roughly 24 pints - during a single night. Drinking: The programme shows students Jake . Hirst, 19, Francesca Leech, 18, Codie McBride, 21, and 19-year-old Sam . Alexander having their alcohol consumption monitored over 'a typical night out' The investigation, which was called . Tonight: Britain’s Young Drinkers, examined the effect of excessive . alcohol consumption on young people and purported to show a typical . night out for the Liverpool students. In fact, their alcohol was being paid for the production team at ITV Studios’ factual arm Shiver. Today, it was revealed that series producer David Warren left ITV last month as a result of disciplinary action by the broadcaster after an internal investigation into the allegations. The programme showed the students – . Jake Hirst, 19, Francesca Leech, 18, Codie McBride, 21, and 19-year-old . Sam Alexander – having their alcohol consumption monitored through a series of health checks over the . course of what was portrayed as a typical night out. They are first seen pre-drinking copious amounts of cheap alcohol at their university halls of residence in Liverpool. The investigation, Tonight: Britain's Young Drinkers, examined the effect of excessive alcohol consumption on young people and purported to show a typical night out for the Liverpool students including Sam Alexander, 19 . The programme put the students, including Codie, pictured, through a series of health checks before and after their alcohol consumption, to measure the impact of alcohol on their bodies . Binge-drinking is defined as consuming five or more drinks for men, or four or more drinks for women, in about two hours, depending on body weight. It is known to pose safety risks associated with car crashes and accidents, and to damage the liver and other organs if the behaviour is indulged in regularly. In Britain one adult in four is a binge drinker, more than any other country in Europe. The NHS recommends that men should not regularly drink more than 3-4 units of alcohol a day while women should not regularly drink more than 2-3 units a day . After four units of alcohol your blood flow increases, you feel less inhibited and your attention span is shorter. It's at this point you begin dehydrating which is one of the causes of a hangover. After six units your reaction time is considerably slower, your liver has to work harder and your judgement decreases. Even . before they head out to start their evening, baby-faced Jake Hirst, who . is studying international journalism, has had 11 beers, four shots, . three whiskies and one vodka. They then head to the city centre’s many . bars – where they are seen downing six more shots and two double vodkas . each. By the time they . return home at 3am they have drunk a staggering 139 units, with the . girls, Francesca and Codie, drinking 25 and 26 respectively, and boys . Sam and Jake downing 40 and 48. To put this in context, the Government advises that men should drink no more than four units in one day, or 21 units a week. Women . should drink no more than two to three units a day, or 14 a week. The programme shows the students (left to right, with Dr Arun Ghosh second from right) - Jake Hirst, 19, Codie McBride, 21, Francesca Leech, 18,  and 19-year-old Sam Alexander - having their alcohol consumption monitored over the course of what was portrayed as a typical night out .

"By . Jim Norton . Blondes have long been the butt of jokes for their supposed lack of intelligence. But those with a fair head of hair can now take heart - for scientists have disproved the dumb blonde stereotype. New research has revealed that hair colour is ‘only skin deep’ because it depends on just a single letter of the genetic code. Not so dumb: The study proves hair colour is completely unrelated to any other trait and dispels the shallow claim that blonde hair signifies lower intelligence . Switching a single ‘letter’ of DNA would turn brunettes to blondes, according to academics from Stanford University in California - and would have no affect on the brain. The study proves hair colour is completely unrelated to any other trait and dispels the shallow claim that blonde hair signifies lower intelligence. Lead researcher Professor David Kingsley said: ‘The genetic mechanism that controls blond hair doesn’t alter the biology of any other part of the body. Switching a single 'letter' of DNA (pictured) would turn brunettes to blondes but not affect the brain . ‘It’s a good example of a trait that’s skin deep - and only skin deep.’ Researchers also found that the gene that affects blonde hair isn’t associated with eye colour - suggesting that blonde hair and blue eyes are not genetically linked. Experiments with mice showed that the ‘blonde’ switch caused animals to be born with light, golden-brown fur. The switch alters activity of a gene called Kit ligand that was already known to be associated with hair colour. Compared with its ‘brunette’ version, which has a different DNA letter, it reduced Kit ligand activity by about 20 per cent. Dr Kingsley, whose research appears in the journal Nature Genetics, said:‘This is a good example of how fine-tuned regulatory differences may be to produce different traits.’ Many other regulatory elements may be scattered throughout the DNA that surrounds the Kit ligand gene, he added. The gene not only aids the development of pigment-producing cells, but has a host of other roles around the body. It influences the behaviour of blood stem cells, sperm or egg precursors, and gut neurons.","New study proves hair colour has no impact on intelligence or personality .

"By . Jim Norton . Insurers and banks are sending customers reems of terms and conditions, with more words than Shakespeare's Macbeth, which is 19,000 words long . Insurers and banks have come under attack for sending customers reams of unnecessary policy documents that are even longer than Macbeth. Nearly three quarters of consumers admitted to not reading all of their policy documents or T&Cs because they were too long. While only 17 per cent of people who did read it in full said they understood it, according to the survey of more than 2,000 people. Consumer group Fairer Finance, who commissioned the survey, has launched a campaign against the book-length policy documents that are riddled with legalese and jargon. Several terms and conditions sent out to customers were found to be nearly twice the length of Shakespeare’s Macbeth - which is 19,000 words long. Analysis by Fairer Finance found HSBC topped the table for the longest bank account T&Cs at just over 34,000 words long - almost 5,000 words longer than John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men. The shortest in the sector was Nationwide’s, though it still weighed in at a hefty 11,000 words. In car insurance, Endsleigh has the dubious honour of longest motor policy with more than 37,000 words - just a few hundred words shy of Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. While Sheila’s Wheels, Esure and M&S Bank all had policy documents of over 30,000 words - longer than George Orwell’s Animal Farm. The shortest in the sector was LV with just under 7,000 words. James Daley, founder and managing director of Fairer Finance, said all banks and insurers should make documents more accessible and do away with small print that is riddled with legalese and jargon. He said: ‘If next to no one is reading terms and conditions, and even those who do are struggling to understand them, then what exactly is the point of these documents? ‘Of course it’s important that customers know what’s covered and what isn’t in their insurance policy, but if one company can do the job in less than 7,000 words, there’s no excuse for insurers who are producing documents that are five times as long. HSBC's terms and conditions were among the longest, the survey found, totalling 34,000 words .","Nearly 75 per cent of customers admit not reading policy documents .

"By . Chris Greenwood . and James Slack . and Jim Norton . Clare Townsend, who had a gun held to her head by Michael Wheatley . A terrified woman victim of a fugitive armed robber known as the 'Skull Cracker' lashed out at officials last night for putting him in an open jail as he was prepared for release. As police urged the public not to approach Michael Wheatley, the Government ordered an urgent inquiry into why he failed to return to Standford Hill in Kent. The 55-year-old – handed 13 life sentences at the Old Bailey in 2002 – earned his nickname by pistol-whipping his victims. Sentencing Wheatley to life with a minimum of eight years, Judge Michael Mettyear told him that some of his victims 'may never fully recover'. But he was temporarily allowed out of the Isle of Sheppey prison as the authorities prepared to release him. One of Wheatley's victims Clare Townsend, 70, said she was 'shocked' to find he was in an open prison and said he is almost certain to rob again. The retired headteacher said she will never forget the day he held a gun to her temple while holding up a branch of the Halifax bank in Raynes Park, South West London. 'Having been on the end of his violence, I would not have thought he was the sort of person that should be in an open prison,' she said. 'I thought he had escaped from an ordinary prison. When I realised he was in an open prison and he had permission to be out, I was very shocked.' Recalling her ordeal at Wheatley's hands, the retired headteacher said: 'Suddenly he swung round, grabbed me by the neck, put a gun to my temple and started screaming at the cashiers. 'In that instant I thought he was going to kill me, because he just seemed so angry. It was almost as though I had personally done something and if he didn't get his money, I would personally be thwarting him. 'He was an extremely frightening and threatening, character. I know they [the police] felt he was an exceedingly dangerous person. 'That's why it's astonishing that all . their hardwork in arresting him and sentencing him appropriately has . somewhat been lost by allowing him to go to an open prison.' Wheatley . raided 13 building societies and banks over ten months in 2001 and 2002 . while on parole from a previous lengthy sentence. His . targets were mainly small branches in areas he knew, ranging from . Southampton to Royston in Hertfordshire, and his crimes netted him more . than £45,000. Michael Wheatley, 55, a violent armed robber dubbed 'the Skull Cracker' for a string of brutal raids on banks and building societies, has gone missing after temporarily being allowed out of prison . Wheatley earned his notorious nickname after pistol-whipping victims - including a 73-year-old woman -  during the raids. Pictured is one of the raids captured on CCTV . As the robberies continued, the violence he used grew. In March 2002 he pistol-whipped a woman of 73 and a building society manager. Wheatley was under the Release on Temporary Licence scheme, given to inmates who are being prepared for freedom. His escape comes amid alarm at the rising number of dangerous criminals being switched to open jails. An immitation black Bruni 8mm pistol which Wheatley used to terrorise people during his string of raids . A silver and black immitation Bruni 8mm pistol used by Wheatley during his raids on banks and building societies in 2001 and 2002 . Michael Wheatley, 55, who was sentenced at the Old Bailey in 2002, has failed to return to HMP Standford Hill open prison on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent Police said . Inmates are absconding from open jails at a rate of one every other day, according to shocking figures. More than 580 criminals – including a string of killers – simply walked out or failed to return from day release between May 2010 and March 2013. The worst year for murderers fleeing open prisons under the current government was 2010-11, when 17 disappeared. Eight went in 2011/12 and nine the next year. Eighteen convicts who fled since May 2010 are still missing, according to figures released to MPs. More than 1,240 serving life – or undefined terms – were moved in 2013. This compares to 393 in 2009. Last night Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said inmates will be forced to wear electronic tags. He said: 'We are not prepared to see public safety compromised, the system has been too lax up to now. 'In future when prisoners are let out on temporary licence they will be tagged, more strictly risk assessed and tested in the community under strict conditions.' Tory backbencher Philip Davies said whoever allowed Wheatley out of prison was 'a berk' and should be sacked. He added: 'It is completely ludicrous that a serving life sentence prisoner is even in an open prison. The top priority should be the protection of the public.' A Prison Service spokesman said: 'This is now a matter for the police.' A Kent Police spokesman said: 'Anyone with any information or who sees Wheatley is asked to not approach him and to instead contact police.'","Government has ordered an inquiry into why he failed to return to jail .

"By . Jim Norton . and Tania Steere . The great Easter getaway got off to a nightmare start last night as travel chaos hit one of Britain’s busiest stations. Thousands of Eurostar passengers were stranded at St Pancras station in London after a man died on a train line in France and a train broke down. Stations, motorways and airports are likely to remain congested over the break, with more than six  million Britons planning trips. Eurostar had to cancel 14 trains, leading to pandemonium as queues snaked around the station and  passengers were hit with delays of up to eight hours. Passengers stranded at St Pancras station after services were cancelled . A fatality near Lille in northern France involving a French high-speed train resulted in diversions and delays to Eurostar. Then, just as services were getting back to normal, a Eurotunnel passenger shuttle train broke down in the Channel Tunnel. By 6.45pm, the company announced it was ceasing trains until today. An announcement on the Eurostar website said: ‘Eurostar services are now closed for the day and regrettably no further passengers are being accepted at our stations. Please do not travel to our stations this evening.’ Motorists using the M25 were also stuck in long traffic jams as the Easter getaway continues . But passengers, many of whom knew nothing about the cancellations, voiced their anger on social media. Sarah Martin tweeted: ‘Really disappointed with complete lack of communication about cancellation of trains and options. No contingency plans.’ Stressed motorists sit for hours in stationary traffic as the Easter getaway continues . Pictures posted on social media showed long lines of passengers snaking around the terminal. British Transport Police said officers has been dispatched to assist with crowd control. A BTP spokesman said last night: ‘A number of officers have been at the station throughout the day assisting with crowd control and supporting rail staff and passengers, and will remain there as long as is required.’ Trains were expected to begin running again as normal this morning, with the first train scheduled to leave St Pancras at 6.18am. A spokesman for Eurostar said the company had worked hard to ensure that 44 services still ran  yesterday. He added: ‘Inevitably there will be a backlog, but we will do everything we can to help the passengers affected.’ More than 130,000 passengers were expected to travel on Euro-star over the weekend. Meanwhile, millions took to the roads last night, with the weekend likely to see as many as 16 million cars on the move. About 3.4 million Britons are set to take an Easter break in the UK involving at least one overnight stay. In addition, 6.5 million Britons are planning day trips over the holiday period. For those staying at home, today is expected to be the best day of the holiday for weather, with cooler, cloudier and wetter conditions as the weekend goes on.","Passengers stranded after Eurostar forced to cancel services .

From the moment she arrived in a strange country at the age of five to the day she was diagnosed with an illness that would ultimately cut her life short, British tennis star Elena Baltacha fought all the way. The Ukrainian-born but Scottish-raised former British women's number one died on Sunday aged 30, from liver cancer. But a leaf through family photos tells . how much she packed into those three decades – from the anxious-looking . child we see here to the confident, glamorous star who went on to . inspire countless youngsters to take up her chosen sport. Tragically, . she learned she had advanced cancer just two months after retiring from . the sport and weeks after marrying her long-term boyfriend and coach, . Nino Severino in December. She . had bravely vowed to fight her illness 'with everything I have' – . echoing the gritty determination she displayed on court. But it was one . battle she couldn't win. She died peacefully at her home in Ipswich . surrounded by family and friends and with her husband at her side. Miss . Baltacha had been fighting illness for a lot longer than just the past . few months. Aged just 19 she was diagnosed with primary sclerosing . cholangitis, a rare chronic liver condition that affects the immune . system. Not that it stopped . her from shining on the tennis court. Miss Baltacha, who was born in . Kiev in 1983, was five when her professional footballer father Sergei's . career brought him to the UK, playing for teams including Ipswich Town . and St Johnstone. She has described seeing little of her father because of his football and came to rely on her mother, Olga, an Olympic pentathlete, to get her to training and matches. 'It's tough when you travel because it's very lonely; all you see are the tennis courts and hotels and it's so nice to have someone there who really knows you,' said Miss Baltacha, whose brother Sergei also became a footballer. It was in Perth that she started playing seriously and at 15 she became the youngest ever winner of the Scottish women's indoor championship. She came to public attention when she reached the third round of Wimbledon in 2002. New life: Aged five, Elena Baltacha and her brother Sergi.

Despite the setbacks, she spent 132 weeks as British number one between 2009 and 2012 and reached a world ranking of 49. Describing her attitude on court, she once said: 'I'm in your face because it's a battle. It's lock horns and see who comes out toughest. But as soon as I'm off the tennis court, I'm just the opposite – chilled, relaxed and not really fazed or bothered by anything.' Her husband said in a statement yesterday: 'We are heartbroken beyond words at the loss of our beautiful, talented and determined Bally.

Prince Harry has taken his girlfriend Cressida Bonas on a skiing trip to Kazakhstan but the couple are staying at a resort owned by a wealthy oligarch with ties to the dictatorship's political elite. The couple, who are experienced skiers, flew by government helicopter to the exclusive resort of Shymbulak in the former Soviet state for a ‘private holiday’. However, the Shymbulak resort is part-owned by Serzhan Zhumashov, whose construction firm is the leading builder of luxury property in Kazakhstan. Scroll down for video . Skiing: Prince Harry, second right, pictured on the slopes at the Shymbulak resort in Kazakhstan . Pose: Harry was happy to take photographs with members of the public while skiing . The oligarch has admitted that he has partly prospered thanks to his political connections - saying that he operates in the 'grey area' between the country's private and public sectors. He has also used his estimated . £130million wealth to build links with the West - including opening a . Kazakh offshoot of a leading English public school. Kazakhstan has been led by president Nursultan Nazarbayev - an autocratic leader who has suppressed political opposition - ever since becoming independent from the USSR in 1991. Mr Nazarbayev has been accused of human rights abuses including censorship and even torture - but he controversially hired Tony Blair as an adviser on a contract reportedly worth £8million.

Bonas, 25, were first spotted openly embracing. Although . enthusiasts might not choose it as the go-to place to hit the slopes, . Kazakhstan has a cold winter which ensures it has powdery snow until . late in the season.

A spokesman for the Prince declined to comment, saying any trip would have been a ‘private holiday’. But royal sources confirmed the couple had been away together. But sources close to the prince said the trip had been organised by a friend and he and Cressida had 'tagged along'.","Couple flew by helicopter to resort of Shymbulak in the former Soviet state .

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Emily Davies . and Jim Norton . Maria Miller had four au pairs but claimed not one of them could be traced to back up her story. So close were the au pairs to the Miller family, they would often travel ahead to ‘make sure the house was ready for the children’. Yet when the expenses watchdog asked for witnesses to the family’s routine, Mrs Miller insisted none of the four girls could be contacted. Maria Miller has been asked to provide witnesses to provide evidence as to how much time she was spending at each residence . She told the standards commissioner: ‘We had four au pairs, all of whom were young girls from abroad (effectively on a gap year, learning or improving their English) and all of whom returned to their homes after their time with us came to an end. This relates to a period up to seven and a half years ago; they were not family friends and I do not remain in touch with any of them.’ It is unclear what efforts, if any, Mrs Miller made in trying to track down these important witnesses to her case. Maria Miller's Wimbledon property, which cost £234,000 in 1996 . But it is understood the names of the four girls were held back from the commissioner who could have made independent inquiries as to their whereabouts. Mrs Miller had been asked to provide the names and addresses of any witnesses who could back up her claims about the time she spent in each of her homes. The minister replied that it would be ‘a concern to me if anyone observed my family’s daily movements’, adding: ‘You will be aware of the security issues MPs face.’ In a 2013 exchange of letters, Mrs Miller insisted: ‘I don’t think anyone outside of my family can provide the sort of evidence that you are looking for.’ But when asked if the au pairs might be able to assist, the minister suggested it would be impossible to contact them. Yet on the basis of her own evidence, the au pairs would appear to have been very much a part of family life in the Miller household. She said that when she travelled to her constituency at weekends, the au pair would ‘often travel down on Thursday to make sure the house was ready for the children’. Mrs Miller claimed she spent ‘most’ of her nights at her Basingstoke home, which was ‘the centre of family life’. But yesterday a neighbour of one of the properties she rented in Basingstoke until around 2008 said: ‘She was only here occasionally - she lived in London and would come here for a meeting every now and again. It’s hard to tell for certain how often she was there as we don’t keep an eye on our neighbours and we are very spaced out around here. But I’m sure she was only here occasionally.’ A nearby farmer added: ‘She moved in when she was first elected. I met her once - she came up one Easter with her children while I was lambing. She was off-duty though, so we didn’t talk about her job. But apart from that, she didn’t appear to be there much - though she may have come in nine at night and left at four in the morning.’ Expenses scandal MP Maria Miller has recently moved into a £1.2million pound home, four miles from her previous rented home in Basingstoke, Hants . Meanwhile in London, a neighbour of her taxpayer-funded ‘second home’ in Wimbledon said: ‘I saw Mrs Miller coming in and out of there frequently, I think it was her main residence but I couldn’t say for sure. 'I’d see her on weekends and sometimes doing the garden. I know her parents lived there, and you’d often see her kids too.’ The commissioner ruled that Mrs Miller’s London home should have been designated the ‘main home’ rather than the Basingstoke one. This was because she had welcomed her parents and brothers to live there, London was where her City lawyer husband worked, and where each of her children in turn went to school. Mrs Miller and her husband Iain bought the double-fronted Victorian house in Wimbledon for £234,000 in 1996. But she increased their mortgage several times until it was £575,000 - well over twice the amount they paid for it. Because it was her ‘second home’, she was able to make taxpayers help fund her mortgage interest payments.In February of this year, she sold the house for £1.47million, banking a profit of £1,236,000. She used the proceeds to purchase a £1.2million converted barn in Hampshire.","Maria Miller was asked to provide evidence about how much time she spent at each home .

"By . Jim Norton . After nearly 400 years of symbolising four nations united in one flag, what would the Union Flag look like without the blue and white of the Saltire? The question is being posed by flag experts after a poll found nearly 65 per cent were in favour of changing the flag if Scotland votes Yes to independence. The vexillologists, as they are known, have come up with designs that could replace the familiar red, white and blue flag. The first design strips out the blue field of the Scottish flag, replacing it with black, and sees the white bands turn a shade of yellow - intended to honour the flag of Wales' patron saint, St David (a yellow cross on a black field) This version removes the white of St Andrew's saltire and imposes a crown and Royal Standard - including England's three lions, the red Scottish lion and the harp, a national symbol of Wales as well as Ireland . Most have removed any trace of Scottish blue, instead bringing in colours symbolic of Wales – both the striking yellow and black from the flag of St David and the red dragon from the Welsh national flag. But some designs retain elements of Scotland, such as the red Scottish lion or the thistle, which could be justified if the Queen remains head of state following independence, as Alex Salmond has stated. The yellow fimbriation is simply adding the gold cross of the Welsh St David flag to the existing union flag . All traces of Scottish blue are removed, with the green from the Welsh national flag fused into the bottom half, leaving the crosses of St George and St Patrick . Last month, the College of Arms said the Union Flag would not be affected by the referendum because the Queen would remain the head of state. But the Flag Institute, the UK charity that advises on flags, has raised the question of a new flag for a Great Britain without Scotland. In a poll, 72 per cent wanted Wales to be represented in the design. A more modern interpretation of the design, including the colours of St David's flag and retaining the Scottish blue - to reflect the fact that Scotland would continue to share the British monarchy . This design removes the Scottish elements from the flag entirely, and adds the Royal Coat of Arms, surrounded by a garland of items symbolic of the Commonwealth nations . The red cross of St George and blue and white Saltire of St Andrew merged in 1606, with a redesign to incorporate the Irish cross of St Patrick in 1801. Flag Institute chief executive Charles Ashburner said: ‘There is already a precedent for changing the flag.’ All traces of Scottish blue are removed, with the green from the Welsh national flag fused into the bottom half , leaving the crosses of St George and St Patrick. The Union Flag keeps its shape but in comes a stark black background. The Scottish influence, denoted by the blue of the Saltire, is no longer welcome. A complete redesign, with no trace of Scotland in the new British symbol but with the flags of England, Wales and Northern Ireland all squashed together in a row. Two of the quadrants are filled with the St George cross and one of the Welsh flag. But in the bottom left hand corner, the St Patrick's cross is replaced the colours of the flag of Ulster . Here, the flags of England, Wales and Northern Ireland are squashed in a row, with no trace of the Scots flag . Again, all trace of the Scottish saltire has gone, leaving the red cross of St George, the red saltire of St Patrick plus the Welsh flag stuck on the bottom right hand corner . The blue of Scotland is replaced with black, and the national plants of the UK – a rose, a daffodil and a shamrock – are added, plus a thistle for Scots who vote No. It is a standard design in royal banners to quarter the flags and have different designs in each quadrant. The Welsh national flag is prominent but England’s appears twice. The minimal change option, with the blue of the Scottish Saltire retained but with a little yellow added to the cross to incorporate a symbol of Wales. Keeping the traditonal design in mind, this version swaps the Scots blue for a plain black from flag of St David . The more detailed design adds the national plants of the UK a rose, a daffodil, and a shamrock. Though the Scots blue has been replaced with the yellow and black of the Welsh flag of St David, there is still room for a thistle to represent those Scots who intend to vote no . All Scottish elements are removed, with blue changed to black and the addition of the Royal Coat of arms and a garland of items symbolic of the Commonwealth. Scotland is removed completely, leaving the crosses of St George and St Patrick, but with the addition of the Welsh dragon. Does it give Wales too much prominence? The blue and white of the Saltire are replaced by yellow and black to represent the flag of St David, patron saint of Wales. This gives the flag a Germanic feel. This funky redesign of the Union Flag remains inclusive, finding room for the blue from the Scottish Saltire and also the yellow and black of the flag of St David representing  Wales. The white of the Saltire is removed, while the main centre panel incorporates the Crown and Royal Standard with England’s three lions, a Welsh harp and the Scottish lion.","Vexillologists have designed replacements for familiar red, white and blue .

"By . Michael Thornton . She was the chirpy, zany, Northern blonde who became the nation’s favourite female clown. But Dora Bryan, who died yesterday at the age of 91, was far more than just a comedienne. At the height of her glittering 70-year career she won a BAFTA best actress award for her performance in the film A Taste Of Honey, a Laurence Olivier Award for her role in The Birthday Party at the National Theatre and was invested with the Order of the British Empire in 1996. She starred on the West End stage in the title role of Hello, Dolly! and for five years was one of the stars of television’s marathon hit, Last Of The Summer Wine.

Dora, right, in comedy Absolutely Fabulous, for which she was nominated for a BAFTA award in 2002 . Yet behind the scenes life was an irrational mix of triumph and tragedy for Dora, who was born in Southport to an Oldham mill owner. Unsuspected by her adoring public, she faced heartbreak and disasters. But when she dazzled, she dazzled like a meteorite. Aged 32, she appeared in her first West End hit musical. Her show-stopping performance caused the impresario Peter (later Sir Peter) Saunders to telephone her after the rave reviews. ‘Can you get to the theatre early this evening?’ he asked. ‘There’s something I want to show you.’ When she arrived at the stage door, Saunders walked her along Drury Lane and pointed to the front of the theatre. She looked up, and there, in lights, were the words DORA BRYAN in THE WATER GIPSIES. Dora at Buckingham Palace with her 1996 OBE . ‘It was one of those magic moments in life that one can never capture again,’ she said. From that . moment on, she was an acclaimed and major star who counted even the . master of comedy himself, Noël Coward, among her ardent fans. Men . were charmed and delighted by her, but there was only one man in her . eyes. She had fallen in love at 17 with the handsome professional . cricketer Bill Lawton, who had played for Lancashire against the . Australians. Following . ‘one of the longest courtships in history’, they finally married after . 14 years on her 31st birthday. The Press had a field day when, as they . emerged from St Thomas’s Church, Oldham, on a bitter February Sunday, he . picked her up in his arms and carried her over the snowy ground. Despite . their happiness and her success in The Water Gipsies she suffered the . first of a long series of breakdowns three months into the musical’s . run, when she found she was pregnant and had to leave the show. Her . baby, born prematurely, did not survive. In . 1957, pregnant again, she had to leave another West End show only to . lose a second premature baby who died after a few days. Dora and Bill, . despairing of ever having a child of their own, adopted a son, Daniel, . and a daughter, Georgina. Then, . in 1962, in the wake of her award-winning performance in A Taste Of . Honey, came wonderful news: Dora found she was pregnant again. The . Lawtons’ son William  was born healthy. But the following Christmas, Dora lost a third baby. Triumph never came without its tragedy, and as the family mourned the loss, her hit single All I Want For Christmas Is A Beatle shot into the top 20 in the music charts.

She survived a terrifying car accident in Spain from which she emerged with six broken ribs, a broken collar bone and a broken shoulder blade, and later underwent six weeks of electro-convulsive therapy and joined Alcoholics Anonymous to conquer her addiction to booze. Still Dora battled on. She delighted film audiences as a headmistress in The Great St Trinian’s Train Robbery and in Carry On Sergeant, and on telly in Dinner Ladies and Absolutely Fabulous. Her last major role was as a recurring character in Last Of The Summer Wine. She was all smiles and bonhomie on screen but at home she was looking after Bill, who had developed Alzheimer’s. They had been married for 54 rapturous years when he died at 88. Dora as Lily Pepper, and Bruce Forsyth as George Pepper, in the television show Red Peppers . Then came the most heartbreaking blow – she too began to show signs of memory loss and dementia. BBC executives were alarmed to see Dora, during a break in filming, trying to use a TV remote control to make a mobile phone call. In 2005, her role in Last Of The Summer Wine came to an end. The final curtain had fallen on a glorious career. Last year, she made her last public appearance at an exhibition devoted to her career at Rottingdean Museum in East Sussex. Dora, a trouper to the last, turned and said: ‘Bye-bye, darlings, I’ve got to go. I have a show to do.’ For the unforgettable Queen of Laughter the lure of the stage lights never faded.","Dora Bryan won a BAFTA award, a Laurence Olivier Award and an OBE .

Mandro Jones, 24, was arrested after the two bay cob mares were found in 'appalling' conditions by vets in February. The animals, named Marilyn and Baby, were found at a barn in Diss, Norfolk, surrounded by rubbish and broken glass. Skeletal: Marilyn when she was found in February.

"By . Sam Webb . Haroon Ashraf outside Birmingham Crown Court. The 24-year-old Birmingham man slashed his pregnant wife with a knife over a missing bag of cannabis . A husband slashed his pregnant wife with a Stanley knife and sprayed aftershave in her face because she hid his drugs stash. Haroon Ashraf attacked wife Neelam at their Bordesley Green, Birmingham, home during a row over missing bags of cannabis. Jurors heard he slashed at the mother, who was nine weeks pregnant, while their one-year-old son was just a few feet away. She was left with a deep wound to her arm which she had raised to protect her face. At Birmingham Crown Court, Ashraf, 24, now of Rotherham, had denied charges of wounding with intent and assault by beating. But a jury of four women and eight men took just one hour and 13 minutes to find the former factory worker guilty following a three-day trial. They had heard Neelam had hidden the bags of cannabis she found on February 8 because she objected to her husband smoking the drug. Two days later Ashraf subjected her to a three-hour attack in which he pulled her hair, slapped her, sprayed aftershave in her face and throttled her. Then, on the morning of February 15, following a night of drinking, he used the knife on his wife of three years after she still refused to hand back the drugs. Closing the case for the prosecution, Paul Whitfield told the jury: 'The consequences could have been permanently disfiguring. 'He approached her and slashed at her. 'If she had not put her arm up she would have looked very different today.' During the trial it was heard that Neelam and Ashraf had argued over his use of cannabis and his drinking in the run-up to the attack. Neelam told the court after the knife attack she knew she had to contact police. His Honour Judge Murray Creed, at Birmingham Crown Court, warned a custodial sentence is almost inevitable . Giving evidence, she said: 'I was really angry because I never knew he would do something like that. I have my son to think about, anything could have happened that day.' Ashram had denied the charges, saying Neelam attacked him with a knife and stabbed herself in the arm. He also denied the assault on February 10. Ashram was released on bail until September 19 when he was warned by His Honour Judge Murray Creed a custodial sentence is almost inevitable.","Haroon Ashraf, 24, attacked wife Neelam over the missing drugs .

"By . Sam Webb . A father-of-three who was left profoundly deaf after a doctor failed to recognise he had symptoms associated with meningities has blasted the GP for leaving him in 'total isolation'. Peter Lovell first began to feel unwell with an earache and headache on September 28, 2008. The next day the 48-year-old felt a pop in his ear which led to a discharge of blood before his symptoms worsened later that evening. His wife Judy, 44, became so concerned that she called the out-of-hours GP service at 10.50pm which led to a call back from a doctor called Patrick Fingleton. Stricken: Father-of-three Peter Lovell  with wife Judie in a picture taken one week before the meningitis struck. He has now won a £500,000 payout after his symptoms were not recognised - with devastating consequences . The GP ran through the symptoms with Mr Lovell before saying it sounded like he had an ear infection and the ear drum had perforated. But despite stressing the severity of his headache and other symptoms, Dr Fingleton advised him to book in with his regular GP the next morning. Incredibly, he also told Mr Lovell he may just need antibiotics and even said '12 hours isn't going to make any difference to it'. But the patient was rushed to Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital the next day after he was violently sick and collapsed at home. He was admitted to intensive care after being diagnosed with meningitis which was later confirmed to be secondary to a middle ear infection known as otitis media. And after being in a coma for eight days, he woke up to find he was completely deaf and suffering from severe tinnitus in both ears. The meningitis had also caused neurological damage which meant he was suffering from problems with balance and memory loss. Mr Lovell even thought his 20 and 18-year-old children were only two and six-weeks-old and couldn't remember having a three-year-old daughter at the time. Serious condition: Mr Lovell was rushed to Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital the next day after he was violently sick and collapsed at home . Medical law experts discovered that if he had been admitted to hospital in the immediate hours after the phone call, intravenous antibiotics would have prevented the meningitis from developing and causing the profound deafness. They also found that Dr Fingleton breached his duty of care by failing to consider the symptoms were suggestive of a middle ear infection that has a risk of multiple complications including meningitis. He also wrongly concluded that a middle ear infection could be safely excluded without a medical examination. And the GP even failed to take a full history of Mr Lovell's symptoms which would have identified the need for an urgent hospital referral for appropriate treatment. Insurers representing Dr Fingleton refused to agree an admission of liability but they have now agreed to pay a £500,000 settlement. The money will cover his on-going treatment costs and specialist hearing equipment - as well as cover his loss of earnings as he had to give up his job as a fireplace manufacturer. Today Mr Lovell, who is originally from Salcombe Regis in Devon but now lives in Andover, Hampshire, said he is frustrated that he has received no apology from the GP. He added: 'I could not have imagined the total isolation that sudden profound deafness can bring and I doubt I will ever really get used to it. 'The tinnitus is probably the worst part as it is just constant and loud in my head. It never stops and I get very frustrated. 'My little girl was only three when I became deaf so I never got to hear her read or speak properly which I have found very upsetting. 'Given all of this I feel I am at least entitled to an apology and for the doctor to hold his hands up and admit he should have done more for me, but not once has this been forthcoming. 'It's very hard not to feel some element of resentment towards him. 'Another major effect of my injuries is how they have stopped me from working which has obviously had a huge financial impact on the entire family. 'However, the settlement will ease the financial pressure we have faced over the last six years and I'm looking forward to having access to therapy, equipment and coping strategies that will make communication easier for me and the family. 'Although this amount of money won't last a lifetime it has enabled us to purchase a house outright so we will never have to worry about rent or mortgages again giving me peace of mind that my wife and children will be secure if anything were to happen to me.' If Mr Lovell had been admitted to hospital in the immediate hours after the phone call, intravenous antibiotics would have prevented the meningitis from developing and causing the profound deafness . Life-changing: After being in a coma for eight days, he woke up to find he was completely deaf and suffering from severe tinnitus in both ears. Medical law experts at Irwin Mitchell secured the settlement from Dr Fingleton - who worked for Devon Doctors Ltd - just months before the case was due to go to trial. Natalie Jones, who represented Mr Lovell, said: 'Thankfully the settlement will provide financial stability as well as access to specialist equipment and therapies to help Peter communicate more easily. 'All medical staff, including GPs and out-of-hours doctors, must ensure they are aware of the potentially serious complications that come with middle ear infection to ensure sufferers are given the appropriate treatment as quickly as possible to prevent anyone else suffering like Peter.' Dr Patrick Fingleton said: 'I am sorry that the patient has these unfortunate health difficulties and, although it cannot turn back the clock, I hope the recent settlement goes some way towards helping the patient with his future needs. 'Although I cannot comment further due to patient confidentiality, I can assure my patients their welfare is always my first concern.' Devon Doctors - who Dr Fingleton was working for at the time - apologised to the father-of-three. A spokeswoman said: 'Devon Doctors would like the opportunity to apologise to Mr Lovell. 'We became aware in February 2011 Mr Lovell was making legal enquiries. We have been informed this has since led to an out of court settlement between the GP and Mr Lovell. 'Whilst we have not been involved with these legal proceedings we apologise most sincerely to Mr Lovell and his family for any clinical failure.' Dr Fingleton was working as a sessional GP at the time of the incident but is not currently doing shifts for Devon Doctors. He said: 'I am sorry that the patient has these unfortunate health difficulties and, although it cannot turn back the clock, I hope the recent settlement goes some way towards helping the patient with his future needs. 'Although I cannot comment further due to patient confidentiality, I can assure my patients their welfare is always my first concern.'","Peter Lovell, 48, became ill with an earache and headache .

Piled high: Morris sold imitation Timberland boots, Uggs and Nike and Puma trainers using 10 eBay accounts . Morris' trial motorcycling career was ended in 2007 when an eye injury threatened his sight. He is a former junior world champion . Morris, 30, of Charnock Richard, Lancashire, was sentenced to 14 months in prison in February last year after selling more than £100,000 of imitation Ugg boots, Timberland boots, as well as Nike and Puma trainers through 10 separate eBay accounts in celebrity names including actor John Malkovich. But now, after serving his sentence, a confiscation order was made for him to pay back £56,000 plus £9,200 in costs, at Preston Crown Court. Morris, whose titles include World Junior Champion in 2003, European Champion in 2005 and Australian Champion in 2005, recruited his mother and sister to act as bankers for his illicit business. The pair allowed cash to be transferred through their bank and PayPal account. Together they all ran the counterfeit shoe trading empire from the family home in the Lancashire village. The fake designer footwear is seen here ready to be dispatched to unsuspecting customers. The crimes came to light after a Trading Standards officers conducted a test purchase of a pair of Timberland boots . Trading Standards officers seized 76 pairs of Timberland boots, 53 pairs of Ugg boots, nine pairs of Nike trainers and nine pairs of Puma trainers . Morris, who masterminded the operation, had pleaded guilty to five counts of possessing counterfeit goods and two of money laundering. His sister Jane Morris, who was found guilty of two counts of concealing criminal property, and their mother Celia Morris, 60, guilty of one count, were handed 40 weeks in prison suspended for two years, with 200 hours unpaid work. Preston Crown Court heard that Morris' money was invested in company shares and a property. He could be jailed for nine months if the cash is not repaid in 18 months. His mother Celia was ordered to pay £12,500 and costs of £11,500 within two months. As well as competing at the British Championships Morris also rode at major events overseas .

"By . Sam Webb . They had Stone Age technology, but their vision was millennia ahead of their time. Five thousand years ago the ancient inhabitants of Orkney - a fertile, green archipelago off the northern tip of  Scotland  - erected a complex of monumental buildings unlike anything they had ever attempted before. These beautiful images, featured in the August issue of National Geographic, capture the structures - built an estimated two and a half thousand years before Stonehenge - in all their grandeur. Archaeological wonder: The Stones of Stenness may be Britain’s most ancient stone circle . Sentinels by the sea: Orkney’s largest tomb, Maes Howe, is aligned to capture the rays of the setting sun on the eve of the winter solstice. 'Orkney is a key to understanding Neolithic religion,' says site director Nick Card. Blessed: With fertile soil and a mild climate, Orkney was a land of plenty for Neolithic homesteaders. Agricultural wealth helped give them the freedom to pursue grand architectural dreams . The workers quarried thousands of tons of . fine-grained sandstone, trimmed it, dressed it, then transported it . several miles to a grassy promontory with commanding views of the . surrounding countryside. Their workmanship was impeccable, writes National Geographic's Roff Smith. The imposing walls they built would have done credit to the Roman centurions who, some 30 centuries later, would erect Hadrian's Wall in another part of Britain. Cloistered within those walls were dozens of buildings, among them one of the largest roofed structures built in prehistoric northern Europe. It was more than 80 feet long and 60 feet wide, with walls 13 feet thick. The complex featured paved walkways, carved stonework, colored facades, even slate roofs - a rare extravagance in an age when buildings were typically roofed with sod, hides, or thatch. Macabre: In 1958 a farmer digging flagstones accidentally uncovered the 5,000-year-old Tomb of the Eagles. It held more than 16,000 human bones mingled with the talons of white-tailed eagles. Sheep graze among the Stones of Stenness, which may have been a model for Stonehenge. In 1814 a farmer tried to remove the ancient stones so he could more easily tend his fields . Fast-forward five millennia to a balmy summer afternoon on a scenic headland known as the Ness of Brodgar. Here an eclectic team of archaeologists, university professors, students, and volunteers is bringing to light a collection of grand buildings that long lay hidden beneath a farm field. Archaeologist Nick Card, excavation director with the Archaeology Institute at the University of the Highlands and Islands, said the recent discovery of these stunning ruins is turning British prehistory on its head. 'This is almost on the scale of some of the great classical sites in the Mediterranean, like the Acropolis in Greece, except these structures are 2,500 years older,' he said. 'Like the Acropolis, this was built to dominate the landscape - to impress, awe, inspire, perhaps even intimidate anyone who saw it. The people who built this thing had big ideas. They were out to make a statement.' The full article and pictures appear in the August issue of National Geographic. Right, this domino-sized figure is the earliest depiction of a human face found in Britain . What that . statement was, and for whom it was intended, remains a mystery, as does . the purpose of the complex itself. Although it's usually referred to as a . temple, it's likely to have fulfilled a variety of functions during the . thousand years it was in use. 'It's clear that many people gathered here for seasonal rituals, feasts, and trade. I've . heard this place called the Egypt of the North,' saidarchaeologist . Julie Gibson, who came to Orkney more than 30 years ago to excavate a . Viking cemetery and never left. 'Turn over a rock around here and you're . likely to find a new site.'","These stunning images show standing stones of Orkney off northern tip of Scotland, built around 5,000 years ago .

"By . Sam Webb . The West Ham footballer was initially arrested and charged with two counts of common assault after allegedly punching and slapping Miss Mansoor . Premier League footballer Ravel Morrison threatened to throw acid in the face of his ex-girlfriend and have her killed, a court heard today. Former Manchester United midfielder Morrison, 21, is also accused of threatening to blow up her house in a course of harassment against his ex-girlfriend Reah Mansoor lasting four years, Manchester Magistrates’ Court heard. The West Ham footballer was initially arrested and charged with two counts of common assault after allegedly punching and slapping Miss Mansoor, 19, and her mother Parveen Mansoor, 39, in the early hours of July 27 in Salford. Morrison, who spoke only to confirm his name, age and address, sat in the dock at the court for the brief hearing as the harassment allegation was also added to the charges. The court heard the additional charge of causing his ex-girlfriend to fear violence would be used against her spanned the period from January 1 2010 to July 20 this year. The charge alleges he threatened to throw acid in her face, blow up her house and have her killed and other threats of violence. David Fish QC, representing Morrison, indicated the defendant would be pleading not guilty to the charges. District Judge Khalid Qureshi bailed Morrison to appear at Manchester Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on August 28. Morrison, originally from Manchester, was initially remanded in custody last week before being bailed. His bail conditions are that he lives in Canary Wharf, London, does not contact directly or indirectly the two women complainants, does not go on to the street where they live, and does not enter the Greater Manchester area except for a court appearance, to see his lawyers or to visit for a West Ham game in the area and to return to London immediately after the match. Claims: The charge alleges Morrison threatened to throw acid in Reah Mansoor's face, blow up her house and have her killed, as well as other threats of violence . Miss Mansoor's mother Parveen Mansoor was also allegedly attacked in the incident . Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012 . Despite being touted as a bright prospect at Old Trafford, Morrison appeared only in the League Cup before former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce took him to Upton Park but he was later shipped out on loan to Birmingham and QPR. Morrison picked up the first of his four England Under-21 caps in a 4-0 win over San Marino in October and was subject to a bid from Fulham in January - although the offer was rejected.

"By . Sam Webb . CCTV appeared to show Jakey being grabbed as he walked along the road by a man (left) who threw him into a white van and sped off . A Big Brother star has spoken of her heartbreak after her beloved pet dog was snatched off the street in broad daylight. Jemima Slade, 42, the second person evicted from last year's series of the hit TV reality show, said she was devastated after her Chihuahua Jakey was taken by a thief in Marylebone, central London. The salon owner said she didn't sleep or eat for four days after the dog she'd had since he was a puppy was stolen. Eight-year-old Jakey got out of Ms Slade's flat in Marylebone at about 6.30pm on Monday July 21. She rushed out after him  as soon as she realised he had gone. The reality TV star believes Jakey was heading towards Golds Unisex Hair Salon in Bell Street, the hairdressers she co-owns with her mother, but never made it there. After spending a frantic night searching for him, she was told someone had spotted him in Cosway Street. CCTV would later appear to show Jakey being grabbed as he walked along the road by a man who threw him into a white van and sped off. 'I was distressed when I saw that,' said Ms Slade, who spent  22 hours scouring local streets trying to find her missing pet. 'I was in shock for four days - I didn't eat and I didn't sleep. 'We got Jakey for my daughter when she was just four. 'She was crying in bed with me last night saying how much she misses him. 'To think the people who have taken him have no compassion for how his owners' feel. 'That is someone else's dog. You can't just take someone's dog off the street.' Jemima now wants to use her story as a warning to other dog owners to have their pets not just micro-chipped but equipped with a GPS sensor so they can be tracked down.

She has put posters up as well as putting  appeals for information on every website she can find. She is also using her Big Brother social media profile to get her message out to tens of thousands of people. 'I will never stop looking for him,' she said. 'We just want Jakey home.

"By . Sam Webb . A man who murdered his sister's ex-boyfriend will spend at least the next 20 years in prison. Paul Mapps, 26, stabbed 27-year-old father-of-one Ian Davies in the stomach during a row at his sister's birthday party in Trinant, South Wales, on January 11. Cardiff Crown Court heard that the defendant and the dead man had previously been friends, but their friendship soured after Mr Davies' relationship with Mapps' sister Dawn, 30, ended. Mapps had denied murder and insisted he was acting in self-defence because father-of-one Mr Davies 'came at him' with a vodka bottle. Murder: Father-of-one Ian Davies (left) was stabbed to death by Paul Mapps at a party. The two had fallen out after Davies ended his relationship with Mapps' sister Dawn . But the jury, which came to a majority verdict, rejected his version of events and ruled that the killing was intentional. Before handing Mapps a life sentence with a minimum of 20 years, Judge Neil Bidder QC said he had shown 'no remorse' throughout the two-week trial. He told him: 'I reject any suggestion you were acting in self-defence when you stabbed Mr Davies. Before handing Mapps a life sentence with a minimum of 20 years, Judge Neil Bidder QC said he had shown 'no remorse' throughout the trial . 'You plainly have difficulty in controlling your anger. 'There is only one sentence I can impose... that is life imprisonment. 'You will serve a minimum of 20 years in jail and will only be released if you are deemed no longer a danger to the public.' Gwent Police Chief Inspector Richard Williams paid tribute to Mr Davies' family for their bravery and dignity during the trial. He said: 'Throughout the trial they have listened to some particularly upsetting details about Ian's death. 'They have remained dignified and I would like to acknowledge their bravery. 'Since Ian's death Paul Mapps has sought to absolve himself of any responsibility by first claiming someone else was responsible and, when this was disproved, claiming he was acting in self-defence. 'His attempts to deceive the court have failed. I hope the verdict brings the family some closure.' Mr Davies' older sister, Carrie, said the family felt a sense of relief that justice had been served - though they would never get over their loss completely. 'It goes without saying that this has been an extremely difficult and challenging time for the family,' she said in a statement issued by police. 'Although the outcome doesn't ease our great sense of loss, we can now start to move forward with our lives, and focus our efforts on looking after and supporting Caine, Ian's six-year-old son.'","Paul Mapps, 26, knifed father-of-one Ian Davies, 27, in the stomach .

"By . Sam Webb . As the nation reflects on the centenary of the start of First World War tomorrow, there is one name that will be forever  associated with the early part of the conflict that shaped Europe's path - John Parr. The teenager was the first British soldier to die in the war, which would end up taking the lives of almost a million more of his countrymen before it ended in 1918. Tomorrow, his grave at St Symphorien military cemetery in Belgium will be visited by Prime Minister David Cameron, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge for a special ceremony. Private John Parr, 17, set off on his reconnaissance bike on the lookout for German troops amid the rolling farmland and woods south of Brussels in August 1914. It was the last anyone saw of him. Scroll down for video . The grave of Private John Parr, the first British soldier to be killed in action on the Western Front. He was just 17. Right, Iris Hunt, his great-niece, will pay her respects tomorrow . Iris Hunt, aged two, holding the hand of the mother of John Parr at a wedding in 1942 . No pictures of him exist, and little is known about his short yet significant life. Parr was born on July 19 1897 and grew up in poverty with 11 siblings - five of whom died before they turned four - in Finchley, north London. His father was a milkman and his mother did laundry for wealthier families and also acted as a midwife. The teenager was a butcher's boy and a golf caddie before lying about his age and joining the 4th Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment when he was 14.

During tomorrow's ceremony Iris Hunt, one of Parr’s great-nieces, will stand by his headstone to read a letter sent by the teenager's mother, Alice, in a desperate bid for information about her son. The 75-year-old treasures a photograph from the 1940s of herself, aged about two-and-a-half, holding her great-grandmother's hand. She told the Sunday Telegraph: 'In that picture, I am holding her hand. So I feel that I am guiding her back to where her son was. 'He was a young lad, so perhaps it was a simple adventure, not knowing what he was getting himself into. It would have been quite exciting.'

Devastation: An East Yorskhire regiment of British troops in silhouette negoitiate their way round a rainwater-filled shell crater near the Western Front, during World War One . Mystery surrounds the circumstances of Parr's death. Military experts suggested his death may been an accident at the hands of his French and Belgian allies. On the night he died, Private Parr is believed to have been at least 10 miles away from members of the German cavalry. Jon Cooksey, a military author, told The Sunday Times: 'There was no German soldier around to shoot at him. John Parr must have died either as a result of friendly fire or an accident.' He said opposition troops would have rushed to take credit for the death, because of their eagerness to be commended and praised for their actions. Prime Minister David Cameron is urging Britons to switch off their lights for an hour tomorrow evening to mark the 100th anniversary of Britain’s declaration of war on Germany in 1914. The Lights Out initiative will be the culmination of a day of commemorative events across the country and in Europe, with members of the Royal Family fully involved at home and abroad. Millions of homes, offices and public and private buildings, such as Tower Bridge and 10 Downing Street, will be included in the ‘shared moment of reflection’ between 10pm and 11pm, leaving just a single candle or bulb illuminating a window as a symbol of ‘continuing hope in the darkness’.

Meanwhile King Philippe of Belgium attended Thimister Cemetery in the country's Walloon region today. He paid tribute to the monument of Cavalier Fonk, the first Belgian soldier to fall in the war.

"By . Sam Webb . A pair of smart glasses that could transform the lives of blind and partially-sighted people could be in the shops as soon as 2016. The revolutionary technology enables those suffering from sight loss to see obstacles and faces, similar to the fictional high-tech visor worn by Geordi La Forge in TV's Star Trek. The smart glasses consist of a video camera mounted on the frame of the glasses; a computer processing unit that is small enough to fit in a pocket; and software that provides images of objects close-by to the see-through displays in the eyepieces of the glasses. The joint project between the University of Oxford and the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has won a £500,000 grant in a Google charity competition. Scroll down for video . Iain Cairns (pictured) tried out the smart glasses in Oxford's Covered Market. He said that the glasses add extra information and detail to what he sees and that everyone has 'drawings around them'. A version of what he sees is pictured on the laptop (left) The money will enable RNIB and Oxford University to create 100 pairs of smart glasses and test them with 1,000 people. This will be the first large-scale test of smart glasses and augmented reality for sight enhancement anywhere in the world and is the first step towards getting the glasses made available to everyone who needs them - for as little as £300. There are 300,000 people registered as blind in the UK who still have some remaining vision  and it si estimated the glasses could help half of them. The smart glasses enable those with very limited vision to make use of what sight remains, increasing their confidence and helping them navigate and communicate with people. The prototype has already enabled users to identify faces and obstacles more clearly than they have seen for years. Dr Hicks of Oxford University is pictured wearing the innovation.  Right, the Star Trek character Geordi LaForge . Within 18 months, RNIB hopes to be able to revolutionise the lives of 1,000 people living with sight loss, providing the foundations to create a low-cost version with additional functionality for people with sight loss around the world. ‘The idea of the smart glasses is to give people with poor vision an aid that boosts their awareness of what’s around them – allowing greater freedom, independence and confidence to get about, and a much improved quality of life,’ says Dr Stephen Hicks of the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Oxford, who is leading the development of the glasses. 'The group has been awarded further funding from the Royal Society to look at introducing more features into the glasses, such as face, object or text recognition. An audio prompt via an earphone would give people more information about who or what they are seeing. ‘We eventually want to have a product that will look like a regular pair of glasses and cost no more than a few hundred pounds - about the same as a smart phone,’ says Dr Hicks. The idea of the smart glasses (pictured) is to give people with poor vision - who are severely sight impaired but can see a small amount - an aid that boosts their awareness of what's around them . Iain Cairns, a copywriter for a marketing agency in London, tried out the smart glasses in Oxford’s Covered Market. The 43-year-old was diagnosed with the inherited eye condition choroideremia at around the age of 12. He has an area of central vision left in each eye. He can still work in front of a computer and carry on writing, but started using a cane around three years ago – mostly as a sign to others that moving around can be more of a problem. On having the glasses fitted outside a café in the Covered Market, Iain reacted: ‘I can see your face. 'It’s like the Lord of the Rings when he puts the ring on and sees things in a new way. The smart glasses consist of a video camera mounted on the frame of the glasses, a computer processing unit that is small enough to fit in a pocket and software that provides images of objects close-by to the see-through displays in the eyepieces of the glasses. The transparent electronic displays, where the glasses’ lenses would be, give a simple image of nearby people and obstacles. The camera with specially designed software interprets the nearby surroundings allowing people to see important things much more distinctly than before, such as kerbs, tables and chairs, or groups of people. The glasses don’t replace lost vision, but assist with spatial awareness. Anyone using the glasses looks through them to make the most of their existing sight, with additional images appearing in their line of sight to give extra information about who or what is in front of them. 'That tablecloth is looking lovely. It’s getting the pattern of the tablecloth. 'It’s like I’ve wandered into an 80s pop video. Everyone has cool A-ha drawings round them.

Nottinghamshire Police were called to a house in the Bestwood Park area of Nottingham at around 5.10am today after concerns were raised about the child. She has been named locally as aspiring police officer Kay-Ann Morris. Loss: A 23-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of a seven-year-old girl. Police at the scene in Bestwood Park, Nottingham, today . A shocked neighbour described the church-goer as 'strict' and said that the tragic youngster was a 'stunning little girl'. The neighbour, who gave his name only as Geoff, said: 'I did not know a lot about her, and nor did anyone here. 'She did her best to keep herself to herself and I think she had two little girls. 'The only time you would see them was when they were going to or coming back from school. 'She was a beautiful little girl, just a stunning little girl, it is so sad that she has gone. 'She was very shy, very quiet, it was obvious she was under a strict regime. The 23-year-old has been named locally as aspiring police officer Kay-Ann Morris. A post-mortem is due to take place this evening. Pictured, some bags outside the front door . 'I know that about eight police cars and at least two ambulances were there at the time. 'I saw the man and Kay-Ann being led out by police to the van and a little girl being carried out wrapped in a blanket. 'It is all so tragic, there has never been any trouble around here. The lady once had a bit of an argument with a neighbour who doesn't live here any more. 'That was over children throwing snow balls, and didn't last long. 'I think I am going to go and get some flowers now as it is just so sad. Nothing like this happens around here. It's a nice area.' A neighbour described the woman as a 'strict' and the little girl as 'quiet' A spokesman for the Seventh Day Advent Church in Nottingham said Morris had attended their church. It is believed Morris had been an aspiring police officer and was featured as part of a special Nottinghamshire Police programme to get more young people to join the force when she was 17. Speaking at the time Kay-Ann said: 'From the age of four I've aspired to become a police officer and being on Tap The Gap has strengthened my drive and determination to pursue my chosen career. 'It has also given me a new found self- confidence.' A 47-year-old man has also been arrested on suspicion of assault. Post-mortem tests are due to take place later, a force spokeswoman said. She declined to comment on whether the pair, who remain in police custody, are related to the child.

"By . Sam Webb . 'Hang your heads in shame': Actor Jon Voight has branded  Penélope Cruz, and Javier Bardem 'ignorant' for their comments about Israel . Actor Jon Voight has branded Spanish film stars Penélope Cruz, and Javier Bardem 'ignorant' after they condemned Israel for its military action in the Gaza Strip. The Hollywood star and father of Angelina Jolie claims the pair are helping to fan 'the fire of anti-Semitism that is raging all over the world now' after they called for Europe to condemn Israel's bombing of the Palestinian territory, which has now claimed at least 1,200 lives - many of them civilians. Married Cruz and Bardem, as well as Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar, are the latest major celebrities to go public with their views on the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The Spanish celebrities speaking out against Israel's actions in Gaza call on the EU to 'condemn the bombing by land, sea and air against the Palestinian civilian population'. 'Palestinians' homes are being destroyed, they are being denied water, electricity, free movement to their hospitals, schools and fields while the international community does nothing,' they add. But Voight says Cruz and Bardem are ignorant about the political realities of the region and the threat faced by Israel. In an open letter to the Hollywood Reporter, he wrote: 'My name is Jon Voight and I am more than angry, I am heartsick that people like Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem could incite anti-Semitism all over the world and are oblivious to the damage they have caused. 'After years of trying to make peace, the wars they had to fight, being attacked by their enemies, and still being attacked, and finally after years of running into bomb shelters and having hundreds of civilians killed by suicide bombers, civilians being killed in their sleep, stabbed to pieces, finding enough is enough and finally retaliating, instead of my peers sticking up for the only democratic country in that region, they go and take out poison letters against them. 'You should hang your heads in shame. You should all come forth with deep regrets for what you did, and ask forgiveness from the suffering people in Israel.' Scroll down for video . Anger: Married couple Penelope Cruz (left) and Javier Bardem (right) are among a group of actors who have penned an open letter calling for the EU to condemn Israel's bombing of Gaza . Today there were reports that Israel has  attacked another UN school in Gaza, killing 10 people who were waiting in line for food handouts as the sun rose on a 27th day of bloodshed. Witnesses and medics told Reuters an air-launched missile hit the entrance of the school in Rafah, where 3,000 Palestinians were sheltering from a fresh wave of strikes which killed at least 30 people across Gaza. Around 30 injured children and adults were rushed through the blood-spattered streets in the arms of residents as differing reports emerged of the attack. Bloodshed: Palestinians aid people injured this morning in another Israeli attack, reportedly on a UN school in Rafah, southern Gaza, where hundreds were sheltering. Reuters reported the attack was on the entrance of the school itself, while the Associated Press wrote that it hit people who were queuing for food handouts nearby . Hurt: A Palestinian man runs in the street with an injured child after the reported Israeli military strike on a UN school in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip . The Associated Press news agency said the attack was 'near' the school and hit people waiting for food supplies outside. Israel's military did not immediately comment. The letter is not the first time Bardem has spoken out in support of Gaza. In an article for Spanish newspaper El Diario last weekend, he called the conflict 'genocide', adding that it amounted to an 'occupation and extermination against a people without means, confined to a minimum of land, without water and where hospitals, ambulances and children are targets'. Voight and his daughter Angelina Jolie in 2011. The New Yorker won an Oscar in 1978 . Branding himself 'outraged, ashamed and hurt', Bardem added that he did not want tax he pays in Spain to be used to support Israeli 'barbarism', before going on to recognise the distinction between the actions of the Israeli state and the opinions of Jews, who may not support the bombings. '...being Jewish does not automatically mean you support this massacre, just like being Hebrew does not mean you are a Zionist, just like being Palestinian does not automatically make you a Hamas terrorist. That's just as absurd as saying that being German makes you Nazi,' he said. Bardem went on to say that he had spoken to a lot of Jewish friends in the U.S. about the conflict, one of whom he claimed had told him: 'You can't call it self-defence while you're murdering children.' Support: One Direction star Zayn Malik (left) posted the words '#FreePalestine' on his Twitter page, leading to death threats from Israeli fans. Pop star Selena Gomez has tweeted support for the Palestinian people . Voight too has voiced his opinions on the ongoing strife before. Attending a pro-Israel rally in Las Vegas, he said: 'Every patriotic American Jew and non-Jew alike must show their outrage, that we will not tolerate propaganda and lies about Israel being the aggressors and suppressors of the Palestinians.' 'It seems anti-Semitism is very much alive,' he added. The Spanish celebrities who penned the open letter are the latest in a long line of famous names to voice their opinion on the four-week-old conflict, many of them coming out in support of Gaza. One Direction star Zayn Malik posted the words '#FreePalestine' on his . Twitter page, which led to both thousands of messages of support, and . also several death threats from Israeli fans. 'People who don't live in Israel don't . have any right to say their opinion out loud,' tweeted Shaked Erez, who added the hashtag #FreeIsrael.

A sports star who showed support for Palestinians was Malaysian cyclist Azizulhasni Awang who wore gloves emblazoned with the words 'Free Gaza' while taking part in the Commonwealth Games. Meanwhile pop star Selena Gomez was ridiculed by the comedian Joan Rivers after she announced her compassion for the Palestinian people. After celebrity gossip website TMZ questioned whether that meant she was a supporter of Hamas, Gomez responded that she was 'not picking sides' but was simply pro-humanity. Gomez . posted a message of Instagram saying: 'It's About Humanity. Pray for .

"By . Sam Webb . Bigamist Simon Lack, 44, married his third wife, above, when he was still married to someone else . A wedding photographer is facing a prison sentence after admitting being a bigamist. Simon Lack, 44, of Northampton, married wife Tanya in a ceremony in Canada 12 years ago before moving to the UK. His unsuspecting wife later returned to their home country and Lack promised to follow once he had sold their possessions. But instead he chose to remain in Northampton, and his wife was unable to afford to get back to the UK. But while he pretended to his wife he was preparing to join her in Canada, Lack began seeing other women after joining internet dating websites. He fell for another woman in 2006 and they married in 2008 while he was still wed to Tanya. On Monday  Lack admitted one count of bigamy when he appeared at Northampton Magistrates’ Court. Prosecutor Caroline Emmet said: 'The defendant went on dating websites and was seeing other people during his marriage. There is evidence of this on Facebook.' In 2006 he met another woman via a dating website and embarked on an affair, failing to tell her he was already married to Tanya. Lack, who also had an ex-wife called Catherine, used his divorce papers to dupe his third wife into believing his marriage to Tanya was over. In 2008 the pair wed in another ceremony with his new bride none the wiser. Lack was finally arrested after his wife, whom he left last October for another woman in Devon, became suspicious and called police. After being arrested, Lack claimed he did not think his second marriage was 'real' and did not realise documents were required to marry and divorce. Angela Hudson, defending, said it was a 'very unusual case' as her client believed his second wife had 'sorted' their divorce. Cutting the cake: Lack's new wife married him in some style in 2008, not knowing he was still married to Tanya .

Magistrates adjourned the case for three weeks to allow time for a pre-sentence report to be prepared. The maximum sentence for bigamy is seven years in prison.

"By . Mike Dawes . and Sam Webb . Sir Bradley Wiggins was denied a golden return to track cycling as he and England's pursuit team were beaten by a rampant Australia in the Commonwealth Games. Wiggins, 34, joined Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Andy Tennant in claiming silver in the 4,000m discipline at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, but there was never any chance of edging out an Australia quartet who built an immediate advantage and never looked like letting it go. ‘I’m disappointed we came second here but in hindsight we’ll look back and think this is a start point for us now,’ he said. ‘Rio is the goal and we’ve got to work back from that.’ The team's valiant efforts were watched by Sophie, Countess of Wessex and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . High profile allegations of abuse by Jimmy Savile and other celebrities have triggered a 20 per cent surge in sex assaults reported to police. New figures released today show police were told of 64,200 sexual offences in the year to March, with officials crediting the publicity around historic allegations for encouraging victims to come forward. It also emerged police are failing to solve half of crimes, including nearly three quarters of cases of theft, criminal damage and arson. Official data from police forces show they recorded 3.7million offences last year, unchanged on the year before. However the number of sexual offences has soared. The number of rapes increased by 27 per cent compared with the previous year and is now at the highest level since records began in 2002-03. The number of other sexual offences increased by 17 per cent. Offences involving obscene publications and protected sexual increased by 31 per cent. The Office for National Statistics said the increases were likely to be linked to the effect of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation into historic allegations of sexual abuse. The number of rapes and sexual assaults against girls under the age of 13 increased 21 per cent, and offences where boys under 13 were the alleged victims rose 35 per cent. The number of ‘Sexual activity involving a child under 13’ offences increased by 33 per cent compared with the previous year, from 2,176 to 2,887 . Mark Bangs, from the Office for National Statistics, said: 'Part of the rise in sexual offences is related to the effect of the Operation Yewtree investigation which has brought to light a large number of historic sexual offences. 'The increase is also likely to reflect a broader Yewtree effect whereby more victims are coming forward to report sexual offences to the police.' Publicity surrounding allegations of abuse against Jimmy Savile has encouraged other victims to come forward . The NSPCC has said that media coverage of the crimes of Savile and others were a key reason as to why victims had felt able to come forward and report their abuse to the police. Of the 30,738 sexual offences, 3,328 - more than 10 per cent - were said to date back more than 20 years. Separate data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales – which records all crimes based on interviews with the public and not just those reported to the police – showed a marked drop in offences. It estimated that there were 7.3 million crimes in 2013/14, down 14 per cent on the previous year and the lowest since 1981 when records began. However, data from 28 police forces in England and Wales, excluding the Metropolitan Police, showed that in April and May this year 52 per cent of crimes were classed as 'investigation complete, no suspect identified', meaning that the case is closed unless new evidence comes to light. This happened in 73 per cent of criminal damage and arson cases, 72 per cent of theft and 56 per cent of robbery, according to figures released by the Home Office, which stressed that the investigations could be reopened later. The survey showed that there were 1.3 million violent incidents, a drop of 20 per cent on the previous year. This is the equivalent of two in 100 adults being victims in 2013/14, compared to five in 100 in 1995. However, according to police figures, violence rose 6 per cent, by around 33,000 offences, although the number of recorded homicides was 537 - down by 21 from the previous year and its lowest since 1978. Deaths by dangerous driving rose sharply to 282, up from 174 the previous year, and police figures also revealed a 20 per cent rise in sex offences. Among all the 43 forces, 36 had seen a rise in shoplifting, including 18 per cent in Merseyside and 17 per cent in Humberside. Fraud was also up by 17 per cent according to police figures, and analysis showed that 5.1 per cent of bank or credit card users were victims of card fraud, up from 4.6 per cent the previous year. Adam Pemberton, assistant chief executive of Victim Support, said: 'It is alarming that so many serious crimes remain unsolved. Victims want to know that the police are doing all they can to investigate the crime committed against them. 'Investigating a crime is a matter for police, who also have a duty to keep victims informed and explain decisions made about an investigation. This obligation is set out in the Government's Victims Code.'","Number of rapes reported up 27% in a year, porn offences up 31% .

"By . Sam Webb . Teacher: Darri Poucher has been jailed after grooming a 14-year-old schoolgirl. He met her at a nightclub where he bought her alcohol and slipped his hand under her top . A 31-year-old teacher has been jailed after grooming a 14-year-old schoolgirl. Darri Poucher showered the girl with attention and met her at a nightclub where he bought her alcoholic drinks and slipped his hand under her top. He became over-familiar with the pupil - calling her 'babes' in private Facebook messages - and groomed her for sexual purposes. The supply teacher, of Deeping St Nicholas, near Spalding, Lincolnshire, denied the charges, but was jailed for one year at Grimsby Crown Court where the judge described him as 'manipulative” and 'deceitful'. Judge David Tremberg said: 'You are a manipulative, deceitful, resourceful fraudster with an unsavoury eye for young girls. 'You are an unreconstructed sex offender and it’s necessary to protect the public from the risk of serious sexual harm from you. 'These offences were a serious breach of trust. It was committed over some time and there was a significant age difference between you. 'These offences are so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence is appropriate for them.' Poucher had become a supply teacher at the school in Grimsby, which cannot be named for legal reasons, in 2009. Michael Smith, prosecuting, said: 'She began to notice that she was different from the other girls in the class because he was making so much of her. 'It became clear to her that he appeared to take a particular interest in her. He was talking to her more often than he would the others. He would see her after school and chat with her. 'He was making her feel that she was a favoured pupil. He began messaging her on Facebook in a way that was wholly inappropriate for a teacher.' The pair exchanged messages about the X Factor and music, in which Poucher called her 'babes' and she called him 'love'. The Pier nightclub in Cleethorpes, North Lincolnshire, where Poucher met the girl after grooming her . In another, she told him: 'Gosh, you are a geek.' Mr Smith: 'She should not have been doing it but what was he doing allowing that sort of behaviour? 'He was prepared to approach this young lady, who was one of his pupils.' The girl . told Poucher she was going to a nightclub in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire . and he deliberately went there to find her and speak to her. He . was friendly towards her, put his arm around her, bought her alcoholic . drinks and allegedly put his hand under her top before stroking her . back. Mr Smith said: 'He intentionally met her in the Pier nightclub and he intended to do something which involved the commission of a sexual offence. 'He was being touchy-feely. He put his hand on her bottom. He was dancing very close up to her. 'He sexually assaulted her. The touching was sexual. He knew full well that she wasn’t 16 or over and the touching was sexual.' The following Monday, Poucher spoke to the girl at school and said he was sorry if he had embarrassed her in the nightclub. Poucher left the school but continued to send messages until April 2012. The matters came to light when the teenager was discussing career options with another teacher. The girl mentioned she had exchanged Facebook messages with Poucher and had met him in the Pier. Despite admitting being friendly with the girl and meeting her in the club, he denied buying her alcoholic drinks or touching her in an inappropriate way. He claimed he had reported the matters to other teachers at the school but they had no recollection whatsoever about this. Poucher was given a 10-year sexual offences prevention order, restricting his future contact with girls under 16, and he must register as a sex offender for 10 years. In separate cases, Poucher had already admitted two offences of fraud by claiming he was a qualified teacher, intending to make a financial gain, between May and July 2011 and between September and May 2012. He was jailed for two years for those offences, to run consecutively.","Darri Poucher, 31, met her in the nightspot and bought her alcohol .

"By . Sam Webb . The Royal Navy’s first female warship commander is facing the sack over claims of an on-board affair with one of her crewmates. While the alleged affair is being investigated, Sarah West, 42, will retain her position as commander of HMS Portland. If the claims against her are proven, Commander West could face a formal warning, reassignment or even termination of her two decades of Navy service. Scroll down for video . Sarah West, the Royal Navy's first woman warship commander is facing the sack over claims of an on-board affair with one of her crewmates . The male officer, whose identity is unknown, may also face disciplinary action. The Ministry of Defence has refused to disclose whether he has retained his responsibilities or if he, too, has been removed from the ship. It is not known if he is married. Cdr West became the first woman to take charge of a frontline warship in the Navy’s 500-year history in 2012. When she was promoted, Cdr West revealed that her job had damaged her marriage to Navy helicopter pilot Andrew Whitlum – which broke down in 2006 – saying: ‘My husband used to be in the Navy and all that time apart is a challenge. ‘People who prosper in the armed forces tend to put their job as the priority, which isn’t the best thing for a happy married life.’ But despite sacrificing her relationship to focus on her trailblazing role, Cdr West, from Grimsby, is now facing the prospect of losing her job on HMS Portland, after allegedly having an affair with a male officer under her command. Her 43-year-old ex-husband now has a son with his new partner in Dorset, where he flies a search and rescue helicopter for the coastguard. Pilot: Cdr West's ex-husband Andrew Whitlum. Right, British warship HMS Portland on the Atlantic Ocean . Yesterday the pilot insisted he had nothing to say about his former wife, who earlier this year claimed that her job left her unable to hold down a relationship. Cdr West, who does not have children, said in an earlier interview: ‘Years at sea probably explains why I’m single.’ Name: HMS Portland . Operator: Royal Navy . Ordered: February 1996 .

However if the allegations are true, she started seeing a subordinate during the seven-month tour of her frigate, which has been conducting anti-narcotics patrols in the Caribbean. This would breach the Armed Forces’ Code of Social Conduct, which prohibits personnel from relationships which compromise ‘operational effectiveness’. Yesterday former head of the Navy Admiral Lord West, who is not related to the captain, said: ‘If she had a relationship with someone under her command then she’s rather let down other women in the Royal Navy, because there are people who will jump on this and say this is why women shouldn’t be on ship.’ He added: ‘The rules banning relationships in the chain of command exist for a very good reason. If the allegations are true I doubt Commander West will continue in her post or be given another ship to command.’ A Royal Navy spokesman said: ‘We are aware of an allegation of a breach of the Code of Social Conduct which we are treating seriously. It would be inappropriate to comment further.’ Video courtesy of British Forces News .","If affair claims are proven, Cdr Sarah West could see her career terminated .

"By . Richard Shears . North Korea's founder could very well be turning in his grave at the news his ruling grandson has removed his revered image from the secretive country's new banknotes. Current leader, Kim Jong-un, would have had to give his approval for the image of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, to be dropped from the country's batch of new 5,000 won banknotes. The face value of each note is about £70, although the market value is said to be less than £1. Time for a change: The face of North Korea's founder will not appear on the new batch of 5,000 won banknotes . However, the current leader has approved images of Kim Il-sung's house to be prominently displayed on the notes, along with pictures of gifts his grandfather Kim and his son, the late leader Kim Jong-Il, have received from foreign leaders. Although there has been widespread speculation about the reasons for Kim Il-sung's removal, most analysts suspect it is for 'continuity' - lower value notes also depict the birth places of Kim Jong-il and his mother. However, Yoon Young-kwan, a North Korean expert at Seoul National University, has another reason. 'Removing his grandfather's image suggests that Kim Jong-un will follow an independent path to develop the North's economy, while due homage is being paid to the former dictators by depicting their birthplaces,' he told South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper. Revered: People bow in front of a statue of Kim Il-sung in Pyongyang, North Korea . Keeping it in the family: North Korea's current leader Kim Jong-un (left) and his father Kim Il-sung (right) Other . analysts suggest that the old notes were an easy target for forgers - . two years ago counterfeit 5,000 won bills from China caused chaos in .

His . portrait disappeared from the 2,000 and 1,000 won bills after a failed . robbery in 2009, although the reasons were not made public. It was never disclosed what punishment the offenders were subjected to although it is doubtful they would have lived to try it again. The new 5,000 won note is North Korea's largest denomination but with the market value being so low workers who receive on average 3,000 won a month have to seek second and even third jobs. The official announcement last month of the new banknotes that no longer feature the revered founder sent panic  through the country among families who feared a total currency reform.

A laptop helped save a 56-year-old man's life after an arrow was fired at him outside his NSW home allegedly by his wife's ex-partner who flew from America with the crossbow to kill him.

The arrow fired by Texas man Jefrey Hooten, 49, struck the lid of the laptop computer Mr Williams was holding instead of directly piercing his skin . Hooten then allegedly attacked Mr Williams with an axe, which he struck over the victim's head. Mr Williams told Nine News he was extremely lucky after he was taken to hospital suffering a head wound. 'The gods were with me,' he said. 'I could have been dead and my wife could have been dead.' Hooten then allegedly attacked Mr Williams with an axe, which he struck over the victim's head . Details of the attempt on Mr Williams' life were revealed in Gosford Local Court on Wednesday where the 49-year-old appeared on attempted murder charges. The court heard the American had travelled to Australia on July 8 without the knowledge of any of his family on a mission to murder the husband of his former wife, Stephanie Williams. As well as the crossbow, he brought with him knives and a piece of wire. He checked into a motel in Gosford, north of Sydney, and travelled to Mr Williams' home on Tuesday afternoon. Court documents reveal that Hooten arrived in Australia last week and had a pre-booked flight home this Friday. Hooten divorced Mrs Williams in 2009 and contact between them was limited.

"By . Richard Shears . Murder mystery: William Glenn, 44, from Mississippi, has turned up strangled to death and wrapped in a curtain in Phnom Pehn, Cambodia, where he had been teaching English for two months . Police in Cambodia are investigating the mysterious death of an American teacher whose body was found wrapped in a curtain at a garbage dump in the capital of Phnom Penh. U.S. diplomats in the Southeast Asian nation could not immediately be reached for comment. But Cambodian police official Mom Sitha identified the man as . The victim has been identified by authorities in Phnom Penh as 44-year-old English teacher William Glenn, a native of Mississippi, who had been in Cambodia for two months, working at several schools in the capital. According to police official Mom Sitha, Glenn left his guesthouse early Tuesday on a motorcycle taxi and never returned. His body was discovered Wednesday, and no suspects have been apprehended yet, he said. Earlier this week, Glenn’s estranged Thai wife has revealed that the teacher had told her of his fear that 'someone was after him' shortly before he disappeared. Nittaya Glenn, 44, said in a phone call from Bangkok that her husband was living in fear shortly before his death. She told the Cambodia Daily: 'He called me many times and said that some Cambodian people wanted something from him. 'He was afraid and wanted to leave quickly.' The woman said she had suggested her estranged husband relocate to China and even offered to pay for his plane ticket. Mrs Glenn said the last time they spoke was on Monday - three days before his body was found. She claimed that her husband had a drinking problem and could sometimes be aggressive, but the problems had never been severe enough during their marriage to get him into serious trouble.' 'Yes, we had marital problems like many people and he sometimes got into fights when he was drunk. 'But I don't understand that in five years in Bangkok it was always sorted out - yet in two months in Cambodia he is murdered.' The murder of Mr Glenn - who is believed by detectives to have been strangled to death - has sparked lengthy debates on expatriate forums in Cambodia, with numerous conspiracy theories being put forward for his murder. They range from a drug deal gone wrong, a failure to pay borrowed money to flirting with another man's wife. Other writers have suggested that the roots of Glenn's troubles lie in Thailand, and that he might have been the victim of an 'international hit'. Gruesome discovery: Glenn's body was discovered by a young boy in a garbage dump in Phnom Pehn Wednesday . But Phnom Penh police said last night that no reason for Glenn's murder had been found and investigations were continuing, along with assistance from the US Embassy in Phnom Penh. Mr Glenn's body was discovered by a young boy searching for 'anything useful' in the garbage dump. Expatriate residents have expressed both suspicion and sympathy in their posts, but point out that people who worked with the American at a local school doubt there was 'local involvement' in his death. His former colleagues are said to have based their beliefs on what William Glenn had told them about the life he left behind in Thailand, although no details about this have emerged publicly. But many people tend to agree that the method of disposing of the body points to premeditation, rather than a robbery gone wrong. In a fatal robbery, they say, the body would have been left at the scene of the crime, whereas Glenn had been tied up and then swathed in a curtain before being driven to the place where his body was found. The Khmer Times said that speculation about a relationship gone wrong was rampant and dumping a body in a visible place guarantees it is found quickly and ensures payment should it be a contracted death. Glenn, who had recently been teaching at an English school in the city before he reportedly stopped working there, had been staying at the Tattoo Guesthouse, where he was said to be a perfect patron. A receptionist told local reporters that Cambodian police and 'the FBI' had spent four hours searching his room and taken away all his belongings. 'He was always sitting alone writing in a book or on his laptop, but he came back every night, even at the weekends,' the receptionist told the Cambodia Daily. Mr Glenn arrived in Phnom Penh shortly after midnight May 4, travelling on a bus from Bangkok, said 22-year-old receptionist Kim Chhern. 'I only spoke to him when he arrived but when I saw him he was always alone and often drunk, she said. 'But he was no trouble and only complained about the internet .","The body of William Glenn, 44, from Mississippi, was found wrapped in a curtain in a Phnom Pehn dump .

"By . Richard Shears . An Australian local council has agreed in a crucial vote to retain a plaque dedicated to disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris - even though it's been stolen. While other tributes to Harris have been removed around the world, the shire of Wyndham-East Kimberley in Western Australia has voted to keep the metal commemorative plaque. But local taxpayers might have to fork out to pay for a replacement because the original, in once-pride-of-place on a stand in a park in Kununurra, was stolen several days ago. Scroll down for video . Officials have voted against removing a commemorative plaque that was laid by Rolf Harris on a footpath . Despite Harris being sentenced to more than five years in jail for indecently assaulting four girls in Britain between 1968 and 1986, a motion to remove the commemorative plaque from the park was defeated by five votes to four. 'I'm disappointed by the decision,' said councillor Keith Wright, who put forward the motion to take down the plaque. 'Some of the councillors argued you can't change history, and cited the example of Ned Kelly being revered as a national hero and the fact his background and record was questionable,' Mr Wright told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 'But I argued that you can't compare standards of a hundred years ago to the standards that we now adopt and are proud of in society today.' Mr Wright said he hoped a fresh vote could be held before the council had to foot the bill for a replacement. 'I hope the council can resolve to permanently remove the plaque to save the community the expense of replacing it.' Harris was sentenced to more than five years in jail for indecently assaulting four girls between 1968 and 1986 . Police have investigated the theft but it is understood no progress has been made in catching the souvenir hunters. Earlier this month another plaque dedicated to Harris was stolen from outside the entertainer's former home in the Perth suburb of Bassendean. The local council had voted to remove the plaque - which had already been vandalised - but before the vote could be taken the memento was stolen. However, the council did vote to strip Harris of all honours and took down his art in public buildings. In further acts to wipe out the memory of the convicted child molester, the City of Perth council voted to remove a commemorative plaque in the city centre while the City of Geraldton agreed not to display any of his art works.

Eight assailants in military fatigues snuck in by boat, climbed onto a wharf and began unleashing a hail of bullets into the restaurant at Water Bungalow Resort on Mabul Island, off the north east coast of Borneo, shortly before midnight. Police guards, who were on duty there due to previous attacks on islands off the east coast of Borneo, returned fire but one was fatally wounded and a second is believed to have been dragged away as a hostage.

"By . Richard Shears . A woman who 'borrowed' a young girl as 'collateral' for a loan she had given to another villager kept the child chained to a post for eight hours a day over two years, it was revealed today. The shocking case of child abuse resulted in police taking the four-year-old girl's 'carer' into custody - but have now decided not to charge her out of pity for her own poverty-stricken circumstances. Police and child protection workers who went to a village hut near the Cambodian town of Kemarak Pumin found the girl sitting on the floor of the community building with a chain padlocked around her ankle, securing her to a post. Heartbreaking: A girl was tied to a post eight hours a day by a woman who 'borrowed' her as 'collateral' for a loan she had given to another villager . The Phnom Penh Post reported today that the girl had told police that on one occasion she was so thirsty that she had to drink her own urine. Last night the girl was in the care of social workers as the shocking circumstances of her imprisonment were revealed. Police said the 'adoptive mother', who had loaned money to the child's biological mother - had taken the four-year-old as collateral against a loan, but found it impossible to care for the girl during the day because she had to go to work. 'The adoptive mother said the girl used to get in rainwater and get messy and she feared she might leave the house and drown or get lost,' said Srey Touch, head of the local police human rights and juvenile protection unit. Released: The girl was found by police and child protection workers and placed in the care of social workers . The adoptive worked as a farmer at a plantation about half a mile from the hut and chained the child each workday from 7am to 11am and then from 1pm to 5pm, the paper reported. Police were alerted to the girl's plight by Keo Chhon, a 60-year-old village resident who told the Post: 'I felt so much pity for her. It is so bad. 'I think all children have the right to be cared for, not chained up like a dog. I wonder why the other workers didn't report it, but for me, I had to report it.' Despite the treatment the girl had suffered, her biological mother said she could still not take her back because of her poverty. 'I love her but I have no-one to look after her when I go to work,' she said, repeating what the adoptive mother had told police. Child abuse is common among poverty-stricken village families in Cambodia, particularly as adults are unaware of laws that protect youngsters. Chhan Sokunthea, head of the women and children's rights section of the child protection group Adhoc, said that youngsters are more often the subject of beatings and other abuse, . 'In Cambodia, 75 to 80 per cent are uneducated and they don't know how to care for their kids,' she said. 'Rarely is there a case where the nighbour or relative makes a complaint.'","Girl, 4, in Cambodia, tied to a post between 7 and 11am and 1pm and 5pm .

"By . Emily Crane . and Sally Lee . and Richard Shears . The Australian father accused of abandoning a Down Syndrome baby born to a Thai surrogate mother reportedly has a criminal conviction for child sex offences. The man at the centre of baby Gammy's surrogacy ordeal was found guilty and jailed in 1998 for indecently dealing with a child under the age of 13, Nine News reports. His wife confirmed the conviction but said he was still a good man and that he has 'changed'. The couple, from Bunbury in Western Australia, continue to deny they are the biological parents of Gammy and claim they didn't even know he existed until recently. Gammy's surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, has accused the couple of taking her son's twin sister but leaving him behind because he was sick. She has also now demanded Gammy's sister be returned to her in Thailand after learning of the Australian man's child sex offence. Scroll down for video . Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon Janbua holds her baby Gammy, born with Down Syndrome, at the Samitivej hospital on Monday . She told Fairfax Media: 'I am very worried about my baby girl. I need help from anyone who can bring my girl back to me as soon as possible... this news make me sick. 'I will take care of my twin babies. I will not give her or him to any family that wants a baby.' The father today told the ABC that Ms Pattaramon was not the woman he believed carried his child and that he had had problems with the Thai agency, which has now shut down. The couple, who have not been identified, are expected to release a statement through a lawyer some time in the coming hours. Gammy's mother has threatened to sue the family, claiming that the children’s biological father, who is in his 50s, had visited her after she gave birth. He had only bought milk for the girl, she claimed, and ‘never looked at Gammy’. 'The twins stayed next to each other but the father never looked at Gammy...could say he never touched Gammy at all,' she said. A lawyer presenting the Australian biological parents of Gammy (pictured right) is expected to address the media from the couple's South Bunbury home in WA . There are no restrictions for child sex offenders who are going overseas for surrogacy under Australian law. However, it is illegal for people living in Queensland, NSW and the ACT to undertake commercial surrogacy in Thailand. 'If you are going to a dodgy agency in Thailand no questions are asked,' surrogacy lawyer Stephan Page told Daily Mail Australia. He said child safety authorities in Australia assess the risk of sex offenders having surrogate children on a case by case basis. Asked whether he thinks child protection will intervene in the case of Gammy's sister, Page said: 'Who knows what will happen?' The Abbott government may intervene, saying that Gammy could be eligibly for Australian citizenship . Ms Pattaramon told the ABC that the pair had cried on the day that they collected their daughter from hospital but left their son behind. She also alleges that they asked her to have an abortion when she found out that she was carrying a child with Down Syndrome. Gammy’s plight has provoked fury across the world with critics savaging his biological parents. Donations have poured in and now stand at more than $200,000. Meanwhile the little boy is still gravely ill at Samitivej Sriracha Hospital in Chonburi province, southeastern Thailand. He is battling a lung infection and, at one point, his birth mother did not expect him to survive. Australia’s Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has labelled Ms Pattaramon a ‘saint’ and an ‘absolute hero’ and said the outpouring of support was a strong indicator of the way Australians felt about the situation. Ms Pattaramon says she will sue Gammy's Australian biological parents for leaving their son behind in Thailand . Gammy's story could prompt the Australian government to look closer at surrogacy laws with the Department of Foreign Affairs already examining practices in Thailand. Agencies were working with Thai officials on the broader surrogacy issues, the department said. Mr Morrison said the legalities surrounding international surrogacy were ‘very, very, very murky’ and regulations must be looked at carefully. ‘Sure, there are lots of Australians who are desperate to be parents but that can never, I think, sanction what we have just seen here,’ he said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also said the case illustrates the pitfalls of international surrogacy. On Friday a Mr Page warned that babies of desperate Australians who are using surrogate mothers in Thailand could end up being put into orphanages after Thai surrogacy laws changed last week . Australians using surrogates in Thailand could also be prosecuted for human trafficking under the new laws that ban surrogacy if the prospective parents aren't blood relatives. The lawyer called the changes 'appalling' and said his clients have been left with no way to contact the pregnant woman carrying their babies, after the Thai military allegedly confiscated medical records from IVF clinics. 'I've been contacted by parents who can't contact the surrogate parents midway through pregnancy. They can't find out whether their baby or the mother is OK,' Mr Page told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's a disaster how the Thai government have announced it. 'These children didn't ask to born in this mess,' he explained. Pattaramon Chanbua shared a tender moment with her baby boy Gammy at a hospital in Chonburi province, southeastern Thailand on Sunday . Gammy, pictured here with his older brother Game and mother Ms Chanbua, is expected to be moved to a hospital in Bangkok in the coming days . The three of them sit happily huddled together on a hospital bed, Game keeping an eye on his little brother . More than $182,000 has been raised so far for Gammy's mother to pay for her sick son's medical expenses . In hospital on Sunday the six-month-old held onto a creme coloured bear, who looked to be wearing a doctor's lab coat . Ms Chanbua previously said she loved the six-month-old boy like he was her own child, and has vowed to care for her son . Commercial surrogacy, where a woman is paid a fee to carry a child, is illegal in Australia. However, if there is an agreement for the biological parents to cover just medical and other reasonable costs, the practice is legal. Ms Pattaramon told of her heartbreak at Gammy's situation, saying she loved the baby boy like he was her own. 'This was the adults' fault. And who is he to endure something like this even though it's not his fault?' she told the ABC. 'Why does he have to be abandoned and the other baby has it easy? Ms Chanbua said she treated the six-month-old like he was one of her own children. 'I love him, he was in my tummy for nine months, it’s like my child,' she told the ABC.'Never think that you're not my child, that I don't care for you.' 'I would like to tell Thai women – don't get into this business as a surrogate. Don't just think only for money ... if something goes wrong no one will help us and the baby will be abandoned from society, then we have to take responsibility for that,' Ms Chanbua said, The Sydney Morning Herald reported earlier on Friday. The campaign by charity Hands Across The Water is still ongoing and they have vowed to donate every cent raised to looking after the little boy . The young mother, who lives 90km south of Bangkok and has two other children, aged three and six, was paid a total of $16,000 by the couple to give birth to the baby. The couple paid an extra $1673 when they first realised - three-months into the pregnancy - that Ms Chanbua was having twins for them and reportedly told her to have an abortion. Ms Chanbua is a Buddhist and refused to have the abortion on moral grounds. She originally agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family's financial problems and the arrangement was set-up through an agency, which has since been closed down. The Australian man and his ethnic-Asian wife could not conceive a baby themselves. 'Because of the poverty and debts, the money that was offered was a lot for me,' she told the ABC. 'In my mind, with that money, we one could educate my children and two we can repay our debt.' The Australian couple, who have remained anonymous, reportedly told Ms Chanbua to have an abortion . Ms Chanbua, 21, agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family's financial problems . Commercial surrogacy is banned in Australia and it is illegal for people living in Queensland, NSW and the ACT to undertake commercial surrogacy in Thailand. It's also illegal for Australians to select a baby's sex. Current Australian Medicare policy forbids Medicare rebates for IVF use for surrogacy and to receive surrogacy as a treatment option in Australia the following conditions must be fulfilled: . Many Australians have flocked to Thailand over the years because the rules were far less strict. However, the rules have changed this week. After Thailand’s military government reviewed 12 Thai IVF clinics involved in surrogacy cases they have announced new laws. Surrogacy is now only recognised in Thailand if: . Surrogacy in Thailand is illegal if: . These new laws will now exclude almost every Australian from pursuing surrogacy in Thailand.","Baby Gammy's Thai surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, claims the boy's biological parents are a West Australian couple .

"By . Richard Shears . A British woman is being held behind bars in the Philippines accused of running a ‘House of Horrors’ in which young children were allegedly held prisoner and sexually abused. Police and child care workers named the woman as 65-year-old Lillian May Thomson, who was found with an expired U.S. passport, and said she was charged with child abuse involving at least five young children. One of the youngsters was found tied to a chair in a locked room in a house near Subic Bay, 75 miles north west of Manila, where the U.S. once had a huge naval base. Police and child care workers named the woman as 65-year-old Lillian May Thomson (centre, wearing green) and said she was charged with child abuse involving at least five young children . Another child was said to be a six-month-old boy who was found severely malnourished, while three girls, all aged seven, were alleged to have been sexually abused. The shocking case is being described by social workers as one of the worst recorded instances of child abuse they have seen. Father Shay Cullen, an Irish priest who runs the Preda Foundation, a shelter for abused children in nearby Olongapo City, said Thomson is facing serious charges of illegal detention and direct assault on government officials. She was also expected to be charged with child trafficking. Father Cullen claimed that when child care workers and police raided Thomson’s house she picked up a spear and threw it at them. According to the Manila-based Inquirer newspaper, police found the children in Thomson’s home after a tip off. Father Cullen said he and social workers from Preda had been told of possible maltreatment and sexual abuse of children after foreigners were seen coming and going to Thomson’s house. ‘One of the children, aged just six months, was found severely malnourished,’ Father Cullen told the Inquirer newspaper by phone. Father Cullen claimed that when child care workers and police raided Thomson's house she picked up a spear and threw it at them . Three girls, all aged seven, and a five year old boy were among those rescued. One of the girls was tied to a chair with plastic handcuffs when police raided the property. Police said the children are now in a safe house, but medical examinations have allegedly revealed that the three girls had been sexually abused. ‘Thomson resisted arrest and became agitated, angry and used invectives against the arresting officers,’ said Father Cullen. Father Cullen told the Daily Mail last night: ‘We believe this was nothing short of being a brothel in which those forced to serve foreign adults were children.’ He said investigations were still continuing because the work of finding out from the children what had happened to them had to be carried out with gentleness due to their young ages. ‘But we have been able to establish from the girls that they and a young boy were filmed naked for a camera, so we suspect this was for use on the internet for the pleasure of paedophiles,’ said Father Cullen, who has been in the Philippines for 45 years. ‘As each hour goes by that we talk to the children, the worse the details that they are able to tell us become. ‘We have learned, for example, that the young girls were taken to parties in Barretto, a red light district nearby, by this woman, although we have yet to find out from them what happened at those parties. ‘I have to say I suspect the worse. This is an hour by hour investigation and we continue to be shocked by what we are hearing. ‘The house was in a filthy dilapidated state and it must have been hell for those young children to be kept there, wondering who was going to come in the door next.’ Father Cullen said Thomson had today been charged with Serious Illegal Detention of five children aged from six months to seven years. She has also been charged with assaulting government officials with a spear. Thompson has two passports, said father Cullen - a British passport showing that she is from Dunfermline, Scotland, and an expired U.S. passport. When child protection officers arrived at the house, Thomson allegedly refused to let them in but then she started swearing at them before throwing a spear which grazed the arm of one of the social workers, Rosemarie Hebron. Father Cullen told the Mail that social workers from his Preda Foundation, of which he is the President, run an official children’s home in the area - ‘a beautiful place by a river and surrounded by hills’ - and it was they who learned of the alleged horrors being perpetrated in the run-down house. ‘Even if there were no allegations of sexual abuse of the children, Thomson is in the wrong because you cannot keep children without an official licence.' Official medical certificates alleging that the girls had been sexually abused have been prepared and will be presented when Thomson appears at the Olongapo City Regional Trial Court, said Father Cullen. Barrio Barretto, the red light district of Subic Bay that the children said they were taken to, is notorious for its sex tourism.","Lillian May Thomson, 65, facing charges of illegal detention and direct assault on government officials .

"By . Richard Shears . Regina Soosalu, 23, was found dead on a beach on Rawa island . An Estonian model linked to Malaysian royal family has been found dead on the same group of islands where a British traveller died in mysterious circumstances a month earlier . Regina Soosalu, who uses just her surname, was found dead on a beach on Rawa island, off the south east coast of Malaysia, 20 miles from Tioman island where the body of Gareth Huntley, 34, from Cricklewood, North London, was found floating in a pond in June. Hasnan Hassan, head of crime investigations in southern Johor state, told AFP seven people had been arrested so far for questioning over her death but declined to comment further. Pathologists are now trying to establish how 23-year-old Soosalu died after she had set out from a resort for a stroll along the beach on July 1. She was initially believed to have drowned . – but police said on Wednesday they had found wounds on her body and . were investigating the case as murder. The island group, a popular destination for British tourists, is gaining a reputation as a dangerous place to be, particular following the murder of a French holidaymaker, Stephanie Foray, ,30, whose partially mummified remains were found buried in a cave on Tioman island in 2011. Just this week, 39-year-old Asni Omar was sentenced to be hanged for her murder. In May 2011 a group of foreign visitors were involved in a bloody brawl with bodyguards who accused them of interfering with a powerboat belonging to the Sultan of Johar on Rawa Island. In 2005 a member of the Johor royal family was taken in for questioning after a Brazilian couple’s wedding was gatecrashed, resulting in a brawl, on Rawa Island. Pathologists are now trying to establish how Soosalu died after she had set out from a resort for a stroll along the beach on July 1. The  model, whose face has been seen on the covers of numerous international magazines, was the girlfriend of Alang Reza Ibrahim, the son of the former Sultan of Johor . Gareth Huntley, 34, from London, was found dead last month in Malaysia . Now police have descended once again on Rawa as they investigate the murder of model Soosalu, a crime that has sent shock waves through the international fashion industry. The reported ‘strong and independent’ model, whose face has been seen on the covers of numerous international magazines, was the girlfriend of Alang Reza Ibrahim, the son of the former Sultan of Johor. The Star newspaper of Malaysia reported today that until Tuesday this week Alang had remained silent about his girlfriend’s death until he wrote on Facebook about ‘the worst tragedy’ of his life. Saying that he was heartbroken, he wrote: ‘Regina my love has passed away on July 1, in the holy month of Ramadan. ‘She is my love, my best friend and will continue to be my inspiration for the rest of my life. ‘Her heart was filled with greatness, love, compassion, for all beings and life itself.’ Senior Assistant Commissioner of Hasnan Hassan of Johor CID told The Star that six suspects had been brought in for questioning. Asked if her boyfriend had been called in as well, Mr Hasnan told the paper that police had ‘yet to bring him in’. A close friend of Soosalu, who asked not to be named, said: ‘She was considered as one of the top models in our industry and made a name for herself through sheer hard work. Soosalu was the best among us.’ Another friend said: ‘She was a star in the scene and her death is a loss to the industry.’","Regina Soosalu was found dead  on Rawa island, off coast of Malaysia .

"By . Richard Shears . This is the astonishing scene that greeted sailors on a New Zealand naval ship - a dog standing helplessly on a drifting log. It was spotted by the crew of the New Zealand Navy ship Hawea in Smokehouse Bay, east of Auckland, after a fierce storm on Tuesday. The black and white dog was spotted by Able Seaman Combat Specialist Filipe Latu who immediately consulted his commanding officer. The crew of the New Zealand Navy ship Hawea spotted the dog standing helplessly on a drifting log . 'Permission to rescue dog floating on a log, Sir,' he said - or a plea similar to that. Lieutenant Anthony Norris did not need to be asked twice and set in operation a rescue mission. 'Seeing that dog floating on a log was certainly an unusual and unexpected sight,' he told New Zealand media. 'There was significant debris in the water and on one large log floating by was this poor helpless dog. 'I would hate to think how long he was there.' The black and white dog was spotted by Able Seaman Combat Specialist Filipe Latu who immediately asked his commanding officer if he could rescue the canine . Able Seaman Combat Specialist Damien Willis held the dog tight after the crew welcomed it aboard . Operation dog rescue was activated with speed and naval efficiency. One of the vessel's rigid-hulled inflatable boats, with four sailors on board, was launched and the dog was more than happy to clamber aboard. Bringing the animal to shore, the sailors were quickly notified that there was someone at hand who knew its owner. The last report to come from the sailors on board the Hawea was that the dog on a log and its owner had been happily reunited. The crew handed the dog over to locals who knew the owner before getting back to work by removing debris from the water .","Navy ship crew spotted the dog in Smokehouse Bay, east of Auckland .

"By . Freya Noble . and Richard Shears . Lisa Marie Smith, who fled Thailand over 18 years ago while on bail over drug smuggling charges, has reportedly been seen in Dublin, Ireland . Eighteen years ago Australian-born woman Lisa Marie Smith vanished from Bangkok, Thailand while on bail for serious drug smuggling charges. Now she has been spotted looking after a coffee shop in Dublin, Ireland, according to a News Corp report. Investigators in Ireland claim that someone with a very similar name to her father is director of the cafe where Ms Smith is said to be working. The last reports of her whereabouts were back in 2011, when it was believed she may have been holed up in an inner-west suburb of Sydney after strange signs with her name scrawled on them emerged. Ms Smith fled Thailand 18 years ago, having become the first foreigner to be given bail on serious drug charges, after her millionaire father, Terry Smith, had paid around $55,000 to secure her temporary freedom to await future court appearances. It had been claimed by police that she was carrying opium when she was first arrested as she tried to fly out of Bangkok - a charge that can result in the death penalty - but that was reduced to 4kg of hashish and 500 amphetamine tablets after her parents arrived in the country with a top lawyer. Ms Smith told police she had been paid to take a backpack to Tokyo for a Pakistani man named 'Hassan', and she was set up as a distraction from a larger smuggling operation. She spent six months in Lard Yao Prison - nicknamed the Bangkok Hilton - before being granted bail and fleeing the country. When she fled from Bangkok in August 1996, the-then 20-year-old daughter of a wealthy Hong Kong-based insurance company executive, is believed to have used a British replacement passport - she claimed to have lost the first in the weeks before her arrest - to flee to Greece. There, she obtained yet another British passport and vanished - ending up among the top 10 on Interpol's 'Most Wanted' list. An international police search, involving crack investigators in Britain and Australia, failed to find any clues as to Miss Smith's whereabouts and her father, who had posted bail for her in Thailand, insisted he had no idea where she was. The woman, who was 20 years old at the time of her imprisonment, was allegedly residing in an inner-west suburb of Sydney in 2011 . Then in 2011 small, fascinating signs written on pieces of plaster and wood, popped up around the inner-west suburbs of Sydney suggesting that Miss Smith was living in the area - and may have even scrawled one of them herself. Written on a small block of white-painted wood, it has been screwed into the tree and the following words written on it in black paint: 'Lisa Marie Smith. I did it for you, Damien. Look at me. Omen.' Just two days earlier another small sign was discovered, written on a piece of plaster that had been painted red, and stuck on the side of a house. It read: 'Lisa Marie Smith. Bangkok Hilton Fugitive 1996'. Around this time British police believed she may have changed her name to an Irish surname, and signs that emerged in the Sydney suburbs of Newtown at the time also reflect this. One of them read: 'New Identity - McGuigan? Travels Eire 2 Australia as Though Invisible.'","Lisa Marie Smith fled Bangkok 18 years ago while on bail for drug charges .

"By . Richard Shears . An unlicenced helicopter pilot who frequently flew Hollywood star Russell Crowe from Sydney to his outback Australian home is on the run after being accused of conning a chopper company out of $450,000. Paul James Bennett, who has a number of aliases, and his partner Simone Anne Wright, are being hunted by police in New Zealand - and the rest of the world - after they vanished from their last known address in Christchurch. A reported fantasist who once told a court in Britain in the early 1990s that he had been kidnapped while working as a helicopter pilot for the CIA in South Africa, Bennett's work with Russell Crowe was all too real for the Oscar-winning actor. Paul James Bennett (left) and Simone Anne Wright (right) are wanted by New Zealand authorities and others worldwide for a series of crimes . Crowe has told police that he hired Bennett - who is now about 50 - after the New Zealander landed a helicopter unannounced on his farm in northern New South Wales in 2000 and asked for a job. The actor was not aware that Bennett did not even have a helicopter licence, but agreed that the New Zealander could fly him to and from Sydney. With a number of alleged crimes behind him, Bennett is now being hunted by police following claims he has ripped off a Christchurch helicopter company, whose owner, The Dominion newspaper reported today, was offering $NZ10,000 ($A9,103) for information leading to the arrest of Bennett and his 40-year-old partner. The owner, who has not been identified, told the paper that Bennett had been contracted by the company to find several helicopters and other parts overseas. During that time, said the owner, Bennett used the alias David Kite, backing up the name with documents which included a driver's licence. He is then said to have fabricated and inflated invoices for parts he had supposedly bought and was reimbursed by the company. The money was then transferred into a bank account in New Zealand. 'He is besotted with Ms Wright and committed crimes to maintain the lifestyle she demands,' the company owner said. Police in Sydney had fraud charges listed against Bennett in 2003 as a result of his work as a pilot for Russell Crowe but he disappeared and the case never came to court. The pair, pictured here circa 2008, operate under a variety of different aliases and Mr Bennett was a former helicopter pilot for Australian actress Russell Crowe . Russell Crowe hired Mr Bennett as his helicopter pilot in 2000, but said he was unaware he was unlicenced . Three years earlier, he touched down on Crowe's 240-hectare property at Nana Glen, near Coffs Harbour, and impressed the actor with his 'cheek' so much that he was hired to fly Crowe around. But Bennett was eventually dismissed after he turned a Christmas party organised by Crowe into a media circus after leaking a rumour that the actor planned to wed movie star Meg Ryan. He also used a photograph of him and Crowe in a chopper cabin to obtain loans from companies. He was later charged with blackmailing a woman he met through a dating service, forcing her to provide cash for his bail on fraud charges. It is understood that so far he has avoided facing a court - and jail should he have been convicted - but police are now on the trail of both him and Miss Wright, who is in her early 40s. 'The pair use multiple aliases and we do not know what identities they are currently travelling under or where they are,' said New Zealand detective sergeant Craig Farrant. 'We urge them to come forward and contact us so that we can talk to them.' Bennett's known aliases are: Paul James Williams, David Kite, Dennis Kite, Paul Lochead, David Hanson. Simone Wright's known aliases are: Sarah Kite, Sarah Shaw, Simone Thalia Williams, Simone Thalia Wright.","Paul James Bennett and his partner Simone Anne Wright are being hunted by police worldwide .

"By . Mark Williams-thomas . and Richard Shears . To her neighbours in a small, rural hamlet in outback Australia, Nina Bekker is a confident woman and caring mother. But the 50-year-old teacher still carries the mental scars from 1978 when she was sexually assaulted three times in one night by Rolf Harris. She was only 14 at the time and the events of 36 years ago had an immense impact on her life. Her daughter Hannah explained: ‘It shows in the way she relates to people. 'I see it in the way she lacks confidence in so many things, and how she questions herself. It’s like she carries these injuries which don’t ever go away.’ Nina Bekker, 50, still carries the mental scars from 1978 when she was sexually assaulted three times in one night by Rolf Harris . Being on a train or a bus in close proximity to other passengers, Miss Bekker would shake uncontrollably and the smell of aftershave or sweat made her nauseous. Miss Bekker was staying at a motel on the outskirts of Sydney with her parents and brother when the assaults took place. ‘I had never so much as held hands with a boy – Rolf Harris took advantage of my complete naivety and inexperience with men,’ she recalls. ‘I can never forgive him for that.’ One evening Harris arrived in the dining room with Australian environmentalist Harry Butler. ‘The two of them were very loud, very boisterous, singing dirty ditties and moving about the room sort of showing off and drawing attention to themselves,’ remembers Miss Bekker. Harris was encouraged to join a nearby group for drinks and later serenaded Miss Bekker’s mother and another woman with sexual innuendo. Miss Bekker was keen to interview Mr Butler for a school conservation project and he invited her to his room for a chat. She said: ‘Leaving my parents in the restaurant I followed Mr Butler and Harris followed both of us into the lift.  As soon as we were in the lift, Rolf Harris began to touch me. ‘Initially his behaviour was like childish teasing, he was poking me in the ribs, tickling me, he called me “little miss spaghetti legs”. She was only 14 at the time and the events of 36 years ago had an immense impact on her life . ‘He pinched my buttocks and seemed to think it was funny that I was embarrassed by this. ‘I felt very uncomfortable with the way he was touching me but it was difficult to object because it was projected as innocent, playful teasing. When we got out of the lift his behaviour became more intrusive. ‘Rolf Harris walked behind me and as he did, he pressed his stomach and groin into my back and put his arms over my shoulders in a kind of hug, except that his hands were cupped over my breasts. ‘He was making a pinching action with his fingers more or less tweaking my breasts in time to a sing-song nursery rhyme tune. ‘I remember he called me a “little wriggly one” and sang something like “legs like spaghetti and breasts like ripe plums” which rhymed with “tiddle um pum pum” – I now know this is a line from one of his songs. ‘This was incredibly humiliating for me. The behaviour of Rolf Harris was absolutely devastating.’ Minutes later, Harris assaulted her again. Miss Bekker said: ‘As I was walking along the corridor I realised I didn’t have a pen or paper, so I went back along the corridor and into my room. ‘I was in the motel room, putting an ink cartridge into my pen when Rolf Harris entered the room behind me.  He asked me what I was doing and took the pen and cartridge from me. In doing so, he spilled ink all over my school rucksack. Veteran entertainer Rolf Harris leaves the Southwark Crown Court after a jury found him guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault . ‘He asked me to show him my hands, saying something to the effect that “we didn’t want inky pinkies”. When I held my hands up, he took my wrists and raised my hands toward his neck and shoulders and started to try to make me hug him. ‘He was saying “come on, how about you give an old bloke a hug, Rolfie deserves a cuddle doesn’t he?”. ‘He was speaking in a coaxing voice and seemed to ignore that I was clearly uncomfortable with this. I was holding my hands like closed fists so that he could not imagine that I had any intention of hugging him and I was pulling away from him. ‘He released my wrists and moved his arms under mine, preventing me from lowering them and he reached around and grabbed my buttocks and lifted me up toward him and he crouched down in an awkward stance, bending his knees into a grotesque posture. The 84-year-old was convicted of indecent assault on four victims aged 19 or under between 1968 and 1986 . ‘For the first time in my life I reacted strongly and shoved him away.’ Miss Bekker swore at Harris and left the room to finish her interview with Mr Butler before heading back to the restaurant. She went on: ‘I returned to the lift. There was no sign of Rolf Harris. But as I was in the lift and the doors were closing he reappeared and put his arm or leg between the closing doors to make them re-open. ‘He made this all seem very dramatic, bouncing into the lift and bumping into the back wall and then in front of me. ‘As soon as the lift closed, he stood in front of me, put one arm around me as though to hug me, but grabbed my wrist and held me in an arm lock, which effectively forced my back to arch and pushed my chest toward him. ‘In the same action he put his other hand inside my shirt and put his hand over my breasts, commenting in a matter of fact voice that “my breasts really were like lovely ripe plums”. ‘This happened very quickly and his actions were very fluid and in retrospect, seemed rehearsed – as though he was very practised in this motion. ‘This attack lasted altogether maybe ten to twenty seconds.  It was very sudden, forceful and entirely against my will. ‘His behaviour was not about sexual gratification, it was about disempowering women, humiliating them. It reflects his whole attitude to women – he is simply a vicious bully.’ Miss Bekker spoke to a reporter last year who passed her details to the Metropolitan Police. She was prepared to testify against Harris, but was not called by the prosecution. An aspiring teenage actress tried to kill herself after being abused by Harris on a youth theatre tour. Tonya Lee, a 43-year-old Australian, waived her right to anonymity to tell how the pervert fondled her on a visit to London when she was 15. As she sat on his lap in a pub, Harris, then 56, indecently touched her.

Traumatised, she stopped eating and then endured a 16-year battle with anorexia, alcoholism and bulimia. Miss Lee later attempted to end her life with a cocktail of laxatives and alcohol. Jurors saw pictures of her on what she thought would be a ‘trip of lifetime’ in 1986.

"By . Sarah Michael . and Richard Shears . Ben Asadollahi Zoje faces life in prison after he was caught allegedly trying to smuggle drugs into Australia . A 29-year-old British man faces life in jail in Australia for allegedly trying to smuggle drugs into the country, hidden among bath salts. Ben Asadollahi Zoje appeared in a Sydney court on Friday where he was refused bail. Police claim that the man was found with 2kg of MDMA - ecstasy - when he arrived at Sydney airport on Thursday from a flight originating in Abu Dhabi. Customs officers who pulled Zoje aside were said to have found the drugs - in a brown crystallised substance - hidden in five tins of bath salts. Chemical tests on the bath salts allegedly revealed the presence of ecstasy. Zoje's father said he was 'shocked' by the charges, speaking to the MailOnline from Belgium. 'The biggest crime he's ever done is a driving offense,' he said. 'Oh my god, I am shaking.' Zoje's father, who did not wish to be named, said the 29-year-old was in London three days ago and he was not aware his son had flown to Sydney. Zoje works as a night club events promoter between London and Dubai. Tim Fitzgerald, regional commander of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, said it was 'a particularly elaborate attempt' to get the drugs into Australia. Customs officers who pulled Zoje aside were said to have found the drugs - in a brown crystallised substance - hidden in five tins of bath salts (pictured) 'Stopping drugs at the border is of the highest priority and ACBPS officers are always alert to people trying to illegally import drugs, no matter the concealment,' he said. Zoje was handed over to Australian Federal Police who are responsible for dealing with alleged offences at the airport. He was charged with importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug. Zoje will appear in court again on July 23. Commander Wayne Buchhorn of Sydney airport federal police said authorities remained vigilant to prevent these type of drugs and other dangerous substances from being brought into the country. The maximum penalty for smuggling a large amount of drugs into Australia is life in prison . 'People bringing these drugs into Australia can be as creative as they like with their concealment, but the AFP and its partner agencies have a track record of identifying and adapting to trends, leading to arrests and disruptions,' he told Sydney's Daily Telegraph. Police said the alleged drugs would be weighed to determine their exact weight and street value. The maximum penalty for smuggling a large amount of drugs into Australia is life in prison.

"By . Richard Shears . The wife of a steward on board missing flight MH370 found joy today with the birth of a baby boy - an event which has led to congratulations from around the world. Friends in Malaysia said that while 34-year-old Intan Maizura Othman was sad that her husband was not around to welcome his baby son into the world, the child had brought great happiness to her after weeks of grief. Her husband, Mohammad Hazrin Hasnan has been missing for 73 days, along with a total of 239 passengers and crew who were on board the Boeing 777 jet which vanished on March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Baby Mohammad was born in Putrajaya Hospital in Malaysiam to Intan Maizura Othman, the wife of a steward who was on board the missing Malaysia airlines flight. She has named the baby Mohammad after her husband . The child had brought great happiness to his 34-year-old mother who is still grieving for her missing husband, Mohammad Hazrin Hasnan who has been unheard of for 73 days . The baby, named Mohammad after his father, was born in Putrajaya Hospital and is the couple's second child. The delighted mother posted a photo of the baby on Facebook, resulting in an enormous response of 63,000 'likes' in the first three hours. Earlier, Intan had posted a photo of herself on Instagram as she waited to give birth in the hospital, the New Straits Times reported today. The baby was the second child for the couple, though it is almost certain that Mohammad Hazrin Hasnan will never meet his young son . As the couple's second child, he received over 63,000 'likes' in the first three hours of his mother posting a photo of him on Facebook . In a moving earlier tribute to her husband after she had accepted that he was not coming back, Intan said on social media that 'my love for you will stay for ever.' She wrote that 'all that happened is so mysteriously insane, but who am I to question Allah the Almighty.' Intan said that she would gradually tell Iman, their daughter, that she has 'lost her papa' and their baby will 'be my pillar to move on.' Their children, she added, would not let him down. 'Remember, I told you I want to be leader of all the Angels in heaven? I'm so jealous now that u r now with them, but never mind, I will join u someday. You are the best husband and papa I could ever ask for.' Intan paid tribute to her husband on social media, saying that she would gradually tell their daughter that she had 'lost her papa' and that their baby will 'be my pillar to move on' The happy news came after the brother-in-law of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah broke his silence over allegations the MH370 pilot was in no fit state to fly after his wife left him. Mr Asuad Khan appeared on ABC's Four Corners to deny rumours that Captain Zaharie had practiced dangerous maneuvers on his home flight simulator. The 53-year-old pilot has been under intense scrutiny since flight MH370 disappeared March 8, with rumours swirling that his personal life and his political leanings had led to him taking the plane and its unwitting passengers on a suicide mission. Mr Khan said Zaharie's wife Faisa had not left him, he had not plotted to take the aircraft down and he was not a political activist who had attended a court hearing of an opposition leader who'd been sentenced to prison. Malaysia said it will publicly release satellite data used to narrow down the search for the missing jetliner to the southern Indian Ocean on Tuesday. The Civil Aviation Department and British company Inmarsat in a joint statement said they would do this 'in line with our commitment to greater transparency'. The news comes after some family members of the 239 people on the plane demanded raw satellite data to be made public for independent analysis. The government says calculations using Inmarsat data showed Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 veered off course and ended in the Indian Ocean after it went missing on March 8. No wreckage has been found and Australia continues to lead the underwater hunt. Authorities believe the plane was flown deliberately off course but are still investigating the cause of the disappearance. 'In moving forward, it is imperative for us to provide helpful information to the next of kin and general public, which will include the data communication logs as well as relevant explanation to enable the reader to understand the data provided,' the statement said. It stressed the data was just one of many elements in the investigation but didn't say when or how it will be released. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, pictured here with his wife Faisa, was not angry with her when he was piloting the MH370, his brother-in-law says . Malaysia has been criticized for its handling of the crisis, especially by relatives of Chinese passengers who make up the majority on board the plane. Earlier this month, family members urged Malaysia, China and Australia to review Inmarsat data for its accuracy. In a letter to the countries' leaders, which is also posted on their Facebook page, the relatives said the data did not 'support a definitive conclusion that no other flight path was possible'. 'We feel that it is necessary that the data be subject to independent third-party review. It is our hope that with out of box thinking, the whole world can help to look for the plane,' the letter said. The search has moved into a new phase, with a Chinese navy survey ship to start mapping the seabed off the west Australian coast this week. Meanwhile, it was also revealed yesterday that the audio recordings of the 'ping' signals believed to . have come from the black box of Flight MH370 will now not be released as doubt grows over whether they are connected with the missing plane. The Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) headed by Angus Houston told the Herald Sun that the search group's original confidence the four accoustic 'ping' signals were from the plane had waned and the recordings would not be made public. 'The recordings of the detections will not be released at this point in time,' the JACC said. 'We continue to pursue this lead to either discount or confirm the area of the detections as the final resting place of MH370.' Asuad Khan, brother of the MH370 pilot Captain Zaharie said the accusations that his brother-in-law had crashed the plane on purpose were unjustified .","Intan Maizura Othman, 34, is the wife of Mohammad Hazrin Hasnan, a steward who was on board MH370 .

A video showing the mother thrashing the 28-year-old man in a village in north east Malaysia has been taken off the web - but not before thousands saw her meting out her own form of punishment. The man, who was caned across his bare buttocks by a tree branch, was so badly hurt that he had to receive hospital treatment. Scroll down for video . A Malaysian mother took the law into her won hands when she tied up and caned a man who allegedly raped her daughter . The man was caned across his bare buttocks by a tree branch and needed hospital treatment for his injuries . If the 28-year-old man is convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl, he will likely to be caned . Ironically, if he is convicted of raping the 13-year-old girl he is likely to be caned all over again by the authorities as well as receiving a lengthy prison sentence.

"By . John Stevens . They are supposed to be a man’s best friend. But it seems a new generation of dogs are not so well behaved. A third of dog owners have being bitten or attacked by a dog, it has been revealed. The rise of the unruly dogs has been blamed on a lack of discipline when they were puppies when their owners could not be bothered to have them trained properly. Snarl: A third of dog owners have been bitten, according to new research. File picture . The leading veterinary charity the PDSA has warned that millions of dogs are more aggressive due to gaps in their pet knowledge. A study of pet owners by the charity found that around 5.3million dogs (some 61 per cent) never attended training classes within the first six months of life. It said 1.3 million dogs across the UK are now displaying behavioural problems. The 2012 PDSA Animal Welfare Report found that a fifth of dog owners in the East of England reported that their dogs show problem behaviour on a regular basis. This was closely followed by the North East (19 per cent) and Yorkshire and Humber (19 per cent). Undisciplined: A lack of or poor training is behind the alarming figure, according to the PDSA. File picture . The area of the UK with the least reported problem behaviour in dogs was Wales (8 per cent). The research revealed that almost one in three (30 per cent) dog owners have been bitten or attacked by a dog with over half (51 per cent) knowing someone else who has. While in some cases dogs are deliberately trained to be aggressive, the report found that the primary cause of the anti-social behaviour is a lack of socialisation and basic obedience training when dogs are young .David Ryan, Clinical Animal Behaviourist and former Chair of the Association of Pet Behaviour Counsellors said: ‘Good puppy socialisation and training classes undoubtedly help to reduce the initial development of aggression, but it is also essential to provide our pets with guidance in good behaviour, at home and elsewhere, throughout their lives. 'Training should be synonymous with ‘living with’ and never stops.’ PDSA Senior Veterinary Surgeon, Sean Wensley, said: ‘Each year there are awful stories of dogs attacking pets and people, sometimes with fatal consequences. ‘Tackling this begins with owners and breeders taking full responsibility for their dogs’ behaviour and adequately socialising and training them from a young age. ‘It is also essential that young people understand how to be safe around all pets and learn how to become caring and responsible owners in the future. ‘In PDSA’s view, this should include learning about a pet’s five welfare needs at school as well as from other responsible adults around them.’","1.3 million dogs in UK have behavioural problems .

Lawyers for convicted wife killer Des Campbell have opened his appeal against his murder conviction by attacking the same crown witness criticised in the infamous Gordon Wood case. Campbell was found guilty in 2010 of murdering his 49-year-old wife Janet Campbell by pushing her off a 50-metre cliff in the Royal National Park, south of Sydney, in March 2005. The Crown says Campbell pushed Mrs Campbell six months after they were secretly married because he wanted her money. Campbell, however, maintains she disappeared on a camping trip after leaving the tent to go to the toilet. Desmond Campbell is appealing his murder conviction for which he received a minimum sentence of 24 years in 2010 . The paramedic and former policeman has now launched an appeal against the conviction and 24-year minimum sentence. At the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on Wednesday, Campbell's barrister April Francis said they were challenging the conviction on four grounds, including that the 'prejudicial' evidence of retired physics professor Rod Cross should not have been allowed. Associate Professor Cross was also a witness in Wood's 2008 murder conviction for spear-throwing his girlfriend Caroline Byrne off The Gap in Sydney in 1995. In Wood's successful 2012 appeal, Assoc Prof Cross's crucial evidence that Ms Byrne was pushed from behind was labelled unsophisticated and lacking impartiality. In Campbell's trial, Assoc Prof Cross also said it was likely Janet was pushed off the cliff from behind. Ms Francis told the three-judge panel the witness did not have the 'relevant expertise' and was acting as a 'voicebox for the crown'. Campbell¿s lawyers are using as part of their defence another case in which British-born playboy Gordon Wood, pictured, won a 2012 appeal against a murder conviction for throwing HIS girlfriend over a Sydney cliff . She said he'd framed his evidence around the case that Mrs Campbell was pushed without investigating the possibility she tripped and fell. Ms Francis said had Wood's appeal already played out by the time of Campbell's trial, it was 'inconceivable' that Justice Latham would have relied on Cross as a relevant expert. But Justice Carolyn Simpson questioned this, saying, 'Wood was a decision on its own circumstances'. Campbell's trial heard Campbell was a debt-riddled Casanova who, by the time his wealthy wife died, had gained $255,000 from the marriage and expected a further $127,000 to follow after her death. Campbell was convicted of throwing his Australian wife off a cliff in 2005 . He did not turn up to her funeral, and a week after becoming a widower took one of his three extra-marital lovers on holiday. He proposed two weeks later. If the appeal is unsuccessful, Campbell's earliest release date is in May 2034. The judges have reserved their decision.","Desmond Campbell was convicted in 2010 for pushing wife of five months off a south Sydney cliff .
